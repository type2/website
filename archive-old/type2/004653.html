Hello all, 
   I wanted to forward this to the list for those people in the Ohio area who won't be attending EveryBus over April 20-22nd.  Stephen Steele and the Central Ohio Westies put together this campout and I'm helping him get the word out.  Pretty much all the info is below.  If you are planning on attending please let Stephen know so he can make arrangements with the campsite so we can all be together.
    There is also a Spring Swap-n-Sale a few hours away at Drew's Off-road in Hamilton, Ohio on Sunday.  I'm told there are some good performance parts deals there to be had.  I figured I check it out.

See you down the road...

&gt; Hello All:
&gt; 
&gt; So, we have eight Bays/Vanagons/Westies expected (and any more who wish to jump on
&gt; the band wagon). Day trippers are welcome if you can't stay overnight.
&gt; 
&gt; Directions from Columbus:
&gt; South on US Rt 23 to Circleville
&gt; East on SR 22  to SR 56 (in town)
&gt; South/East on SR 56 to Adelphia/Laurelville
&gt; SR 327 South to Tar Hollow State Park
&gt; Allow at least an hour for travel from Cols.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For directions from East of Columbus:
&gt; Take SR 37 South at I-70 to Lancaster
&gt; SR 22 west to SR 159
&gt; To SR 56 South/East to Adelphia/Laurelville
&gt; SR 327 South to Tar Hollow State Park
&gt; Probably 1 Hr 20 min. from I-70.
&gt; 
&gt; I am sure you'll have no trouble finding it...after all, you drive VWs don't
&gt; you?  You can figure out anything!
