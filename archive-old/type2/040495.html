Subject: 2.0L heads

This is really getting frustrating.  Is there a way to tell if my heads have
been flycut too much?  The machine shop had to make the combustion chamber
bigger to lower my CR.  Now even with .060&quot; shim at the bottom, the pushrods
are too long.  This was my original problem.  Is there a place where I can
get various dimensions for the heads &amp; case?  Thanks.
