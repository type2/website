Subject: Doghouse cooler Hoover bit fabrication

The following article in the library describes how to fabricate a Hoover bit
for the doghouse oil cooler.

http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/sealfram.htm

I am having problems reading some of the handwritten dimensions. I was
wondering if anyone has made one of these recently and knows the dimensions.
What I need is
  1.. The overall length of Piece A - the right side of the piece as shown in
the drawing (looks like either 3 7/8 or 3 7/16).
  2.. The overall length of Piece B (although this might not be as critical as
piece A).
  3.. The height of Piece A (looks like 1 1/4 or 1 1/2)
  4.. The height of the upper holes in Piece A ( 3/4 ? )
I can wait until I have the engine apart and figure it out but I would like to
fabricate it in advance if possible.

Sincere Thanks,
Bill Moon
