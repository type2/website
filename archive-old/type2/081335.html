Subject: Re: [T2] Corvair Engine for bus wanted


&gt; I'm wondering about the supply of corvair parts.  Do they have a healthy
&gt; aftermarket built up?  Does (gasp) chevy provide better support than VW?

This is the place to go for Corvair goodies. Be forewarned, Corvairs were
only made in the USA, and went out of production in the late '60's, so NOS
parts are rare and expensive. Us VeeDubers should be thankful that Type 1
engines are still in production in third world countries, assuring cheap and
plentiful spares, at least for the time being.
