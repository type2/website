Subject: Brake Pedal = Stalled Engine

Hello,

I hooked up my brake servo line to the part in my Weber single (dual barrel)
and the brake servo now kicks in great, but stalls the engine?

Should there be any change in the rpm's when the pedal is pressed?  I checked
the lines leading to the brake servo and the &quot;check&quot; valve, all are
functioning 100% with no leaks.

The PO did replace the master cylinder and much of the brakes with new German
parts.  I'm wondering if he needed a seal or something for the brake servo or
is the brake servo bad?

Thanks,

Tom
