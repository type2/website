Subject: FS in San Pedro, CA

1969 Westy (white) at 
Magnum Auto Sales
1722 S. Gaffey St.
San Pedro, CA 90731
(310)832-3148

*Very* pretty bus -- fresh paint, gray industrial replacement carpet
kit, looks like front bucket seat upholstery has been re-done, camper
set-up looks good (gold vinyl) and complete, looks like a decent sound
setup with fader and 4 speakers. It's got Hawaiian print curtains
(unfaded), blue nose and cargo hatch emblems, 195R15 tires (they look
pretty new), and engine looks clean but not suspiciously so (which is
about all I can tell about an engine by just looking at it. I drummed my
nails on the nose and rear corners -- all steel, no bondo (you can
*really* tell the difference with acrylics!).

No one was around so I couldn't get a price or hear the engine run. I
have no connection with thi vendor, they're just down the street from me
and I've noticed that they have the occasional bus for sale on a regular
basis. This bus was so nice-looking I just had to check it out.
