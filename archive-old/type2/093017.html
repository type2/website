I don't have my manual handy but I would study first how to read the 
schematic. Will tell you why some are numbered and what represents the 
ground, etc.

I'll dig up a schematic here soon and try to help you along.

&gt;Bentley manual has a good wiring diagram for your bus.

&gt;Take each wire individually and chase it from it's source and to it's load.
&gt;I did this when I was adding relays to my headlight circuits. The
&gt;schematics make perfect sense after to learn to read them - color codes,
&gt;wire numbers, symbols, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Once I learned to read those schematics effectively it is easy to see that
&gt;the bus wiring is not too bad.
&gt;
&gt;I would be happy to correspond with you and head you chase the wires once
&gt;you get a copy of the schematics so we are looking at the same things. We
&gt;can do it on the list and everyone can pitch in here and there until we get
&gt;you straightened out. Don't pay anyone. Spend a bit of that same money you
&gt;would pay somebody on a decent light, a decent digital multimeter, and a
&gt;Bentley. When you get done you will be smarter, have some new resources
&gt;(tools), and you will hav &lt;http://health.yahoo_dot_com/&gt;Yahoo! Health - Feel
