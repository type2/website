Subject: Engine Removed!

Well I (we) finally removed the motor from my '74. Thanks to all those
that have given me advice.  I managed to get all the cooling tim off, and
tomorrow night I remove the heads (hopefully the new ones will be here by
then).
The removal was fairly straight forward, until the motor fell off the jack
towards the front of the bus.  Apparently the engine is heavier on that
end.  Nothing damamged, at least not that I can see, as it only fell a few
inches.  We amnaged to get it back up and into the garage.

So far so good.  I am a little concerned aobut replacing it, but I don't
think it will be all that difficult.  I'll keep you al updated.

Craig
