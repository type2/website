Hi Chris,

In my experience 180 grit is way too fine use a 40 or 60 grit to get it down 
to almost the level you want then about 100 to get even closer finishing by 
hand with your 180 grit.

I've also found that if you apply too much pressure while power sanding then 
the filler gets hot and fuses on the disk/belt in a solid mass, I've had 
success by frequently taking the sander of the work and letting it clear 
itself.

Clogging will also occur if you sand before the filler is well cured - I 
would leave for two days before power sanding.

Good luck
