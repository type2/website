Subject: Re: [T2] Tap

&gt; Anyone know where I can get a tap to thread holes intended for the shift
&gt; shaft?  I believe that the hole size is 12mm, but the thread is finer than
&gt; what I can find locally (so far).

Get to a real tool supply.
In miami Id pop over to dewitt tool. You must have a supplier like this
locally.
