&gt; If you'll look at the fan on both your installation and the one 
on shoptalk you may note that it is twisted so that when spinning 
clockwise it draws air through the alternator, from the rear to 
the front. It's not trying to &quot;steal air&quot; from the cooling fan 
intake and is, in fact, assisted by the motor cooling fan being 
nearby.

Okay, my mistake.  I still worry that it would overheat.  If that 
installation would have worked, I'm pretty sure VW would have used 
it instead of the fancy ducted solution they came up with.  The 
old addage, &quot;Parts left out cost no money and cause no repair 
problems&quot; comes to mind.

&gt; Also, I noted something else in your pictures. Are you running 
that alternator as a separate unit for the aux battery alone? If 
not (if it is now your only source of charging) why do you still 
have the belt on the original alternator? That's just a HP thief 
if it isn't being used.

The plan was for it to be separate for the aux battery but the 
primary alternator is in fact dead at the moment so the 2nd 
alternator is carrying the whole load.  The only reason I haven't 
removed the belt is that I'm lazy.  :-)  The horsepower draw from 
an unloaded alternator is not significant anyway.
