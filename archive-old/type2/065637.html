Subject: DECSION : Engine options: New Block, New Turn Key Engine, Get a R ebuild

I bought an engine from a junk yard through a repair I was recommended. 

Engine with all the stuff I don't have on my 1600 (and that's a lot) is 

$1000. I'm getting it put in in a few weeks and I'll tell you how it=20
goes.

Oh yeah I went with a '78 'cause they have the hydraulic lifters.=20


Thanks for all your help.
