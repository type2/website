Subject: 30/31 PICT-3 vacuum signals (was follow up EB06 trip report)

As stated in my previous post, I discovered that my engine had sucked 
the accelerator pump injection tube (little brass tube) into the #2 
cylinder and that is what caused the #2 spark plug to get all bent up.

I tested the compression and all four cylinders register 115#, so it 
appears that there is no lasting damage to cylinder #2.

I had a spare carburetor that I put on (see subject line), but I am 
uncertain what vacuum port to use (there are 4).

On the 34 PICT-3, I used the port on the driver's side, whose vacuum 
signal was 0 at idle, but 15-20 at 3500 RPM.

This same port on the new carb has a maximum vacuum of 5 (3500 RPM).  
There are three ports facing the rear.  The one in the middle is 
manifold vacuum (15 at idle and near zero as the revs increase), the 
port to the right of that registers no more than 3 under throttle.  
There is a port down low on the carb on the right side that angles up 
that has a similar vacuum signal as the side-facing port on the 34 
PICT-3.  That's the one I'm using for my SVDA distributor.

What is the collective wisdom of the list?
