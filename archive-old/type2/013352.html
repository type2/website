&gt;What a great idea!!

I've been meaning to mention on this whole subject, this is basically a
&quot;shot bag&quot; an old metal worker/body mans trick.  You can in fact if you
want make something more portable than a sandbox by taking a big
old 70's style heavy leather woman's purse and filling it with either very
small steel shot or the sand about 75% full.  Then you just sit your
shot bag on something solid (the floor, a tree stump, whatever) and pound
away.  Eastwood also sells urethane hammers of various contours that
work nicely for this task if the rubber proves unable to get out sharp
creases.  Finding a genuine shot bag in an auction is another great
thing but they have more value than you might thing, I've given up bidding
at about $40 on a 12&quot;x12&quot; one around me being sold at an old body
shops equipment auction.  I have sand in a purse.
