&gt;  Matt, these are very interesting numbers and has me rethinking 
the
&gt;components to use. I have an e-mail in to Vintage Air, I C E and 
also Friged
&gt;Cool (manufacturer in Texas) to see what there answers will be to 
the
&gt;numbers you posted, being they all claim there Sanden only use 1 
1/2 HP.

It did on my bus, and therefore it will only produce as many BTUs 
as Matt listed in his last post (something south of 5,000).  I had 
my bus on the dyno and observed the 1.5hp power loss from the 
Sanden compressor so I know it's true (okay, it may have peaked at 
2hp).  As Matt correctly asserts, you can't get something for 
nothing.

A BTU rating for a condenser or evaporator doesn't really mean 
much since it's just a heat exchanger.  Under what conditions are 
they claiming 16,000 BTU?  I would argue that with the expansion 
valve of the A/C system and the max airflow through the evaporator 
as installed in MY bus, 16,000 btu is beyond impossible.  That 
rating is probably related to the maximum possible heat exchange 
with a large temperature differential and unlimited airflow.  
There is a lot more involved in BTU transfer than the heat 
exchanger itself!  Don't be misled.

Another reference point - I have a 5,000 BTU window unit air 
conditioner that we took with us to BNNTA a couple of years ago in 
a heat wave.  It was well over 100 degrees in the shade, and with 
the air conditioner in the front window on high, it cooled the bus 
down to the point where I was shivering.  I can guarantee a couple 
of things - #1, you will NOT get 32,000 BTUs out of the in-bus A/C 
system that spurred this discussion (and thus their advertising is 
a bit misleading) and #2, if you DID get 32,000 BTUs out of it, 
the interior temperature of the bus would be at 40 degrees within 
a minute or two of turning it on.  If you doubt this, go to Home 
Depot and ask them to demonstrate the biggest, baddest window A/C 
unit they have.  It will be rated in the neighborhood of 18,000 
BTUs.  Turn it on high and stand in front of it for a few minutes, 
then close your eyes and picture this much A/C in your bus.  It is 
way more than you will ever have and it's barely half of 36,000 
BTUs.

&gt;Speaking of A C h p, in my wifes new PT crusier, when you floor 
it the A C
&gt;compressor turns off till you let back up on the gas pedal! I 
guess they
&gt;know you need the extra ponies to pass with.

Most Fords have done this for the past 15 years.  They also do 
lots of other things when you floor the throttle, like richen the 
mixture, turn off EGR, and retard the ignition timing.
