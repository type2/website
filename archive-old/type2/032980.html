Subject: 71 Westy questions, Charlie Ford

Still lovin my ancient Westy, after 2 weeks of ownership. 

Got my Bus Depot top seal and inside Westy handles... Good vendor, I
asked for 2 day and something must have burped, as it arrived Next day
service at no extra charge for the weekend. They will have more of my
bizz. Plenty of chances to make up the expense. Thanks Ron. As someone
in the mailorder car parts bizz, that is a nice touch.

-Am I correct that you can substitute the Left rear window with nasty
opening wing with a like Right side solid glass? I don't want that
leaker in there.

-I have some (most) of the original curtain material in okay condition
if anyone wants it, you pay for $5 priority mail postage and it's yours.
(Plaid stuff)

-Looking for advice on insurance for the bus as an &quot;RV&quot;. 

Glad to see Charlie Ford on the list... He inspired me to drop out for a
month last year and drive the perimeter of the USA in my Alfa sedan.
Priceless memories and views, great people along the route...

Thanks Charlie... :o) Still looking for the source of the wind though

Ramble over..
