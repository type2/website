Hi!

My boyfriend and I just bought an orange '76 pop-top camper! This is my
first VW and camper as well, and I am in love!! We were reading &quot;How to keep
your VW Alive, for the complete idiot&quot; days before we actually bought it. It
has a newly rebuilt engine, new brakes (although they are *very* squeaky),
new ball joints, new clutch and some other new stuff!

We are planning a trip to Utah for the holidays with our two Chihuahuas, and
want to find a good heater, possibly battery powered or other, to keep the
inside of the van warm for the puppies and us. Something safe, that we could
possibly leave on low while we were out snowboarding that wouldn't catch our
van or dogs on fire? Not sure if something like this exists, but would be
interested in hearing peoples experiences with heating their vans.

Also, the car came with an oil temp gauge and we want to install it. I
talked to the mechanic who came with the car and he said that we could
either install the sensor on the dipstick, or an engine unit to send the
info to the gauge. I told him to get the engine part, but was wondering if
you guys had experiences with both and which you found to work better, if
one of them did.

I am looking forward to hearing your responses, we are hoping to do lots of
work on the camper ourselves and want to be as educated as possible!


-Cara
