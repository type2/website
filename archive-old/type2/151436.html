I believe both engines were intended to go into beetles. The Mexican  
bus was water cooled for a long time and I'm not sure if the Brazil  
buses got their engines from Mexico. The octane quality of the fuels  
between those two countries might also dictate certain requirements.

BTW, I drove a 98 Mexican beetle a couple of weeks ago and the while  
that old beetle feeling is there the car feels modern (if not cramped  
by today's standard). The best thing going for it, is that modern FI  
system that VW Mexico equipped the cars with. Of all that beetles I  
drove that day, it made the most of the engine.

Btlmex used to  sell the parts. If you could pick up a complete  
system for a reasonable price it would be a great addition to one of  
those engines.
