Hello Ian   You are telling me that you had the fan hub off, replaced the o 
ring but didn't put in a new seal just covered everything with silcone ,    Why 
didn't you replace the seal while you were there??? I have seen seals look 
good only to find that the spring inside them had come off.  Also did you check 
the oilcooler seals and sending unit???  So when you go into it again check 
the drian hole use a new seal and oring, you shouldn't need any sealant other 
than maybe some on the oring and where it goes against the hub, I use Permatex 
super 300 for this. use a drop of blue locktite on the bolt and be sure to 
torque it right, you don't want that bolt to come off.  Stay away from the silcone 
  later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import Service  Salem Va
