Subject: Re: [T2] 'Tis The Season'--

I don't think the spring, from the angle of dropping,
would go any where but to the bottom of the case and
should not be picked up by the gears. Also if you have
a good many miles on the engine when it hits the
bottom it will stick in the normal sludge there, Phil
