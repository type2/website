Subject: seemingly rare issue with vacuum assist brakes on '71 bus

Hello all,
  First question for the list:
  After rummaging through the archive for a similar problem, I can't seem to 
find others with this
same issue:  As I apply brakes, rpm's rise dramatically.  As a guess, from 
900 to 1500 - 2000.
And unlike one other thread in the archive, the rpm's will stay up the 
entire time brakes are applied.  Just recently put all new hoses on the 
system (same problem before the new hoses).
   Any help would be greatly appreciated.

'71 camper - in the family since '94
