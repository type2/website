Subject: Electro-what?  Doh!  It idles, it runs, it's alive!

Once again list-wisdom comes through!  I kind of thought that the electromag cut-off might 
be important after reading some stuff in the archives but really got the message after 
reading the breadloaf Bentley manual.  It has a pretty good section on 30 PICT 3 carbs and 
it was pretty obvious after reading it that the EM cutoff was the problem.  Of course, if I 
would have just waited until today after I read my mail I would have come to the same 
conclusion!

Now I need to buy a timing light and actually tune it.  That's where the fun starts.  At 
least I can get the thing home where it belongs.

For Joe Fournier:  the engine originally came from a '69 Beetle but I don't think Type IIs 
got a 1600 until '68.  But I can't remember, I wasn't born until '69!
