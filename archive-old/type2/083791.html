HUH???  I have not seen this.  There should not be any holes in the
cylinder of your cat.  If your original cat has been replaced, there my be
a threaded hole in the cone on the end for an O2 sender (the wasser boxers
put the O2 sensor there and that cat can substitute in the '79-83 CA
exhaust settup)

&gt; 2. Is there a starting point for the CO adjustment screw?

No.  Your bus will run (badly) with the screw in nearly any position, but
*must* be taken to an exhaust gas analyzer to have this set properly
soonest!  I would leave it alone, unless I was sure it had been &quot;played
with&quot; by a DPO.  If that were the case, I would screw it all the way in
(full rich)

&gt; 3. A starting point for the idle speed adjustment?

800-1000 RPM? Depends on manual or automatic trans.  there is not a
setting like the &quot;turn it all the way in and back out 2 turns&quot; that there
is on a carb, alas.

&gt; 4. The timing. When #1 is at TDC, the divot and the mark on the pulley
&gt; point right to 7.5 BTDC as specified by Bentley. When running it reads
&gt; around 27 - 28 BTDC. What is going on here?

Craig, you have connected your vacuum advance to the wrong port!  You are
seeing max vacuum advance at idle which means you are attached to a
manifold vacuum port.  The ported vacuum attachement (hoping you have FI)
is on the throttle body.  Look toward the front of the bus and almost
underneath the throttle body... that port there is ported vacum for the
advance.
