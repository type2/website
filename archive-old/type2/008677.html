&gt; George and the List,
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry George, but I gotta take issue with your comments about the
flammability
&gt; issue.  If the painted part is dry enough to handle in order to put
it into
&gt; the oven, there will not be enough volatile solvents left to make a
flammable
&gt; mixture.  The nose is very sensitive, but it takes several percent
of the
&gt; solvent (depending on exactly what it is) to reach a flammable or
LEL (lower
&gt; explosive limit).  I do agree with the smell issue, which may also be
&gt; hazardous.

You make an excellent point here.  I was thinking of my own practice
of putting still-wet paint in the oven.  A small volume of liquid
solvent can turn into a large volume of vapor, enough to go boom if
ignited.

Dry paint should not be a problem.
