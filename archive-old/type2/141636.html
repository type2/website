Subject: RE: Re: [T2] microbus news

&gt; Is Westfalia still in business?  Will there possibly
&gt; be another Campmobile?


Yes, and no.  Westfalia is still in business, but is now majority-owned by
Daimler/Chrysler. As a result they are now doing the &quot;factory&quot; camper
conversions for Mercedes vans (sold in the U.S. as Dodge/Freightliner
Sprinters).  One of those conversions is sold in the U.S. under the
Airstream name (see http://www.52weekends_dot_com/). It is a hightop and is very
expensive.

Because of their new ownership, Westfalia has severed their &quot;official&quot;
relationship with Volkswagen. In Europe many companies make camper
conversions for VW and other vans on an aftermarket basis (just as there
were many aftermarket companies that made VW Bus conversions in the U.S. in
the 60's and 70's). Westfalia will continue to convert VW vans in Germany on
an aftermarket basis. But there will be no more &quot;factory authorized&quot; VW
Westfalia conversions. Instead, VW plans to come up with their own poptop T5
(new &quot;Eurovan&quot;) camper, without Westfalia's involvement. Unfortunately there
are no plans to sell it in the U.S. at this time.
