Subject: Re: Going Cross Country!!!

Lessee...  I used the westy a lot for extended trips, so maybe some of this 
will help.  Mine is a 77 Deluxe, so we did have a bit of room and a lot of 
goodies going in... YMMV when it comes to your car.

I made sure I had essentials.  I used the &quot;jump seat box&quot; of recent 
discussion for parts and tools.  Since my spare was front mounted, I was able 
to put a divider in the old spare tire compartment to make a separate jack 
storage area on the bottom (I have a hydraulic jack) and use the remaining 
space, once I put a short pole in it, for extra closet space.  Recently, tho, 
I thought about changing this to shelves for food (and shoe&lt;grin&gt;) storage.  
I have a lot of good backpack gear which, considering the tightness of space, 
is worth it's weight.  Remember, you have a lot of storage space, but you 
have to be really ingenious as to how to use it!

The fridge... well, it was not working (do any of these things work??) so I 
used Ice blocks, and got one of those little battery operated fans to 
recirculate the cold air, and it worked, well, OK.  I am thinking of figuring 
out a way to convert the whole space (the fridge box and the space behind it 
that it's guts sit in) via insulation and fibergalss to make the whole area 
there a fridge, and put the guts for it in the old spare tire indentation in 
the back closet, and boarding it over, using high capacity computer fans 
(12v) to move air for the coils.  You need a way to keep food cold, tho!

The dogs are going to take up a lot of space - I tried this once, and then 
found a doggy sitter.  I love them, but it was too hard in a van to keep 
everyone under wraps.

Clothes... well, I understand you're backpackers, so you know how to pack 
light and make what you have work!

I also did away with the big table, and used the little one between the front 
seats.  It gave me a lot more room.  Also, if you have a poptop, using the 
upstairs loft for the bed and the back bed for storage helps. Don't forget 
the storage on the roof as well!!!I I thought about having a friend in the 
sheetmetal shop at work make a box that fit up there, was watertight, and 
opened toward the curtain window, kind of half round on the front for 
wind-worthiness (it'd look like one of those things on top of a semi) , to 
store stuff like clothes or food or essentials.  A friend used it as the 
storage spot for his porta potty, tho I would not suggest that (he had this 
blue stain on his carpet from moving it in and out and spilling it (ewwww) - 
I put mine behind the passenger seat.  

The ex was in the process of making a shower for it, stringing a curtain with 
hooks on a frame on the back door, a pallet to stand on, and a kitchen 
spritzer and a couple of homemade tanks made from this big black PVC pipe 
strapped to the roof, but it never took off.  I was worried about the grey 
water on the ground...  and he was lazy.  This is doable, tho... I saw a 
picture of a vanagon with a similar setup, and it was cool!

Speaking of, he *did* make a tank from a hose and one of those 5 gallon 
collapsable water containers and an adapter he got at an RV store... kept us 
from dumping our sink wastes on the ground. The only solution I could think 
of for doing a shower like that would be to buy a shower pan at, like, Home 
Depot and plumb it and make a stand for it... I guess it could be carried on 
the roof when travelling.

I made a set of dark curtains and fabricated a rail behind the drivers seat 
on the ceiling so at night we had some privacy in the living quarters.  
Worked better than the stock curtain that goes in front of the window for one 
reason - one can drive, and the other can sleep in semi darkness.

Other things... he also built this frame to replace one of the jalouise 
window panels with a bank of fans for ventillation, using, again, the little 
computer fans.  Too bad that never got done... if I could find it, I'd finish 
it, as forced air vents would be nice.  We did wire in extra 12v plugs, which 
came in handy, and the biggest gel cell deep cycle battery that would squeeze 
into the left side of the engine compartment.  For shore power, we got one of 
those little 6 outlet plug adapters with the built in 15A breaker.  Oh - we 
replaced the old 10A charger with a 15/50 unit that was about the same size, 
and when we were parked, had no problem keeping things running, from a fan to 
a small TV (And no fish smell - if you have the other one, you know what I 
mean!!!).  Get nesting cookware, and think small, and we used Corelle plates 
(very thin, durable, and not plastic) and these K mart 99Cent plastic 
tumblers.  We used adapted pill bottles for salt, pepper, and spices, and 
were able to store it on top of the water tank without worrying about things 
gougiong our water supply.  We put a bungee cord between the closet and the 
light (made a cheapy bracket to do this) and hung paper towels from there.

Oh... Get a cellphone.  It's nice to have communications!!!  Plug it in to 
the deep cycle battery circuit so it can be left on without worry.  J.C. 
Whitney has these cool things, like a 12 Volt coffeepot and microwave... The 
coffeepot works good (and leaves the stove open for cooking), and I suspect 
the microwave may be underpowered, but usable.

All in all, we ended up with a place that was very roadworthy and comfy.  
Some of the things we could have done would have made it nicer (like the 
shower!!!) but it worked.  He used it for 2 weeks straight when they had this 
thing at his work where he had to be there, and he had no complaints.  I know 
the times we used it it was really nice - a little cramped, but for the 2 of 
us, it was great.  In fact, solo, it's wonderful.  Like a small studio.

About the dogs... Like I said, they will take up a *lot* of room.  Even if 
they're small.  Figure floor space for food and water (get slop proof bowls) 
and space for food.  You'll have to keep them tied up when you stop (you 
can't believe just how fast they can dashh out the sliding door when you 
crack it open!), and you'll have that doggy smell to contend with.  If you 
can't leave them, you'll have to take all this into consideration.  Like I 
said, we decided, after the first time, to leave them at home - mostly for 
our sanity.  It made the trips more enjoyable.  But if you can handle this... 
Go for it.

Hope all this helps.  If there's anything I can help with, drop a P-mail, OK?
