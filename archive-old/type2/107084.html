Subject: Re: [T2] bad tire news

For my daughter's bus, I recently got Goodyear Wrangler HT, 185R14C,
rated A for traction, B for temp, 340 for treadwear.  1710 lbs load, 55
psi.  Bit pricy, but feel like a highwaytire for a M&amp;S rating, and feel
really solid in the wind.

&gt; Folks, 
&gt; Was finally ready to order a set of Continental cr21 185/14's for
the 78 this morning...but couldn't find them again on tirerack.
 Called and they said discontinued by continental.
