Subject: Re: Cooling tin photos needed

Let me rephrase this. I have the deflector tin above the pushrods, but that
is all. Is there any other tin at the bottom of the cylinders, and if so, I
would appreciate a link to a photo somewhere.

Thanks,
Ron

&gt; As previously mentioned, I have a '77 bus with a '71 1600 DP engine.
&gt; Nearly all the cooling tin was severly kludged or missing entirely. I
&gt; searched all day yesterday trying to find a photo of bottom view of the
&gt; cylinders showing the installed cooling tins on the cylinders to no avail.
&gt; The exploded parts drawings I found just aren't doing it for me. I need to
&gt; see them in place for comparison. Does anyone know where the heck a good
&gt; clear photo of the lower cylinder tins in place on a 1600 can be found?
