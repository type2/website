&gt; Ugh.
&gt; Anyone have suggestions on a source for new/rebuilt T1
&gt; engine?  Local (SoCal) would be ideal.  I'd like to
&gt; buy a longblock, but I'm sure my exchange is worthless.

Call up Ronnie at Old Volks and buy one of his Mexican engines.
It'll be dropshipped from somewhere in SoCal directly to you.  It's
probably the easiest way to get an engine.  I've done this twice with
good results each time.
