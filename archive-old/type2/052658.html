You see what I have to deal with?

Ken doesn't support me by helping me, he asks me to take down the archives.

I am forced to say &quot;no&quot; do DOZENS of people because Ken says &quot;no&quot; to me.  He
left me in charge of Archives, and I start to discuss it and he is the one
who takes his toys and goes home.

::: What's important is that it has never mattered who owns it--we've been
able
so far to deal with this in an atmosphere of cooperation and respect, if not
affection, without anybody threatening to take his ball and go home. I'd
love it if that could continue. :::

Sorry that it DOES matter who ownes it, why does KEN HOOPER own it any more
than the members of the list.

Asmosphere of cooperation and respect means you don't ban users for talking
about tires.

I respect what I respect, my respect is not blind.

If you do have access to copies of the archives on CD-ROM, I would be 
interested...

Thanks,
