&gt; Bingo! Terminal 50 is battery power no matter where you are in the

&gt; solenoid directly, not the starter. Look at your wiring diagram, is 
&gt; the hot side of the battery labeled &quot;50&quot;?

No, I think that's &quot;30&quot; :-)  (See Richard's reply to my message.)

&gt; Ever notice the &quot;15&quot; on your coil?  Isn't there a &quot;30&quot; on the 
&gt; solenoid?  Hmmmm.

&quot;30&quot; on the solenoid comes from the battery, and &quot;50&quot; on the solenoid 
is the signal  from the starter switch.
