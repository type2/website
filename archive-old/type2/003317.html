Hi renoir here.

I once had an engine fire. The van had been standing turned off for over
half an hour,
When i noticed smoke pouring out the vents. I viewed this from inside an
apartment.
I ran out opened the hatch and put out the fire. An extra battery had lodged
positive
side against the metal.

My hatch was not locked!! What a pain if it had been. What if a bystander
had
tried to help. Can you see it now, where is the owner, where is his key?

Just my thoughts and experience.

cya :)
