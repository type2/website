  As Brian says a badly adjusted box can bind. However, I believe
  that it wasn't possible to adjust the steering box on busses from
  about 72'. The worm and peg system that allowed the 'tightness'
  of the box to be adjusted without having to change the shims
  was changed.

   all this might be irelevent)
