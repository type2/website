Subject: Re: [T2] CV Joint repacking/overhaul

&gt; Has anyone
&gt; repacked/regreased their CV's and reinstalled the dished washer or is it
&gt; standard procedure to not put them back in.  Does is matter? Just wondering
&gt; why I have it in the kit, but the books say not to use it.

I think that the problem is that use of the dished washer (which is
actually a Bellville spring) puts pressure on the snap ring.  If the snap
ring groove isn't exactly square the pressure might pop the snap ring out.
Obviously, all buses came with the snap ring so it doesn't pose a problem
in most cases.  I leave it out, but if you have put it in I don't think
that it's worth a disassembly to remove it.

Oddly, the bentley for the bug does not recommend omitting the washer, so
it must be a bus thing.
