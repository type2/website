X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

The PO of my bus had a similar experience just before she sold me her bus
because the engine was siezed.  The jiffy lube genius put in 4 quarts of
oil. This is too much in an 1800 Isn't it ??? I'm kind of new at this but
Muir mentions 2.6 qts as full. I've replaced the fried engine with a type 4
2L and I.m nt sure where full is . The dipstick tells me around 3.5 qts.
Does anyone Know for sure??

&gt; I've read in this group before that overfilling a VW engine can result in
&gt; REALLY bad things. I got my '73 bus, Mr. Tang, back from the shop
yesterday.
&gt; As it is new I had them do a variety of things, among them change the oil.
&gt; Since I picked it up it has felt a little sluggish. I discovered this
&gt; morning that they overfilled my oil by about a quart.
&gt;
&gt; What does the list think should be done at this point?
&gt;
&gt; 1. Drain off the extra oil before heading home tonight
&gt; 2. Drain off the extra oil after I get home tonight
&gt; 3. Don't bother draining off the extra oil at all
&gt;
&gt; My drive home is over a mountain highway (No. Cal. Bay area's Hwy 17). It
is
&gt; something of a workout for the bus.
