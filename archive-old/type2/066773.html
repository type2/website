&gt;it stays. Just have to figure out how to get ALL the paint
&gt;off from underneath. Not easy with all the flanges, etc.

I vaguely remember reading or hearing that Berg sells certain mufflers
without paint specifically for those interested in applying their own
coatings.  Does anyone know for sure if this is correct? That would save
costs for those of us who don't have access to a glass bead cabinet.  If so,
it sounds like buying an unpainted muffler or heat exchanger and painting it
with this zinc paint would be the cheapest solution yet over powder coating
or aluminizing.
