Subject: Re: [T2] Canadian Tires / michelin X ? ??

Here in Australia we have two recommended replacements for Michelin X.
XCD: http://www.michelin_dot_com.au/tyres/tyr_pas_cata_XCD.cfm
and Agilis 81: http://www.michelin_dot_com.au/tyres/tyr_pas_cata_agilis.cfm
Neither look as aggressive as those in Richard Atwell's page though.

I also saw mentioned that 185R14 tyres are not common in the US. Both here
and all through Asia, by far the majority of commercial vehicles (vans and
utes) have 185R14 tyres, so the correct size and load rating are very easily
sourced.
