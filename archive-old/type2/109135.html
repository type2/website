&gt; Yes, all but two. The NLA molded hose from the s-boot to the decel valve
and
&gt; the NLA molded hose from the s-boot to the oil breather. The latter failed
&gt; on me and a list angel was kind enough to supply a replacement.

Thanks Richard for the info. A thought on the two molded hoses. If I could
find the right size hose to match them or something close, would it be
necessary for them to be molded? The bends don't seem to be severe enough to
restrict flow on a non molded hose.What do you think?
