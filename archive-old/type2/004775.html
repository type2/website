Subject: camper electrics in UK

Can any UK based (preferably London ) camper owners recommend someone who
can look over the fridge and light electric setup in my 71 Dormobile.
Looks as if my gas fridge has a switch thingy that is rumoured to power it
by 12V while driving ( according to the manual and the nest of wires on the
right of my engine compartment ).
Some aren't connected and I'd like them to be.
Thanks
garp
