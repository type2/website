Subject: tin needed

good friday folks!
I started removing the original engine out of my recently acquired 79 
automatic westy and was astonished at the engine tin missing.  The PO 
stated that he had a problem with it running hot and now I see why!!  In 
the following URL:
http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t201000.gif

the following parts are missing: #10 (r&amp;l), 15, 20, 21, 27, 32, 33 and 36.
If anyone has these pieces available, I'd be really happy to purchase 
them.   Please pmail if you can help in any way.  thanks, Greg
