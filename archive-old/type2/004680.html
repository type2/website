Volks,
I am swapping a working FI system to my carbureted 2 liter.  I know about
the gas tank and fuel pump.......

My question regards to the wiring at the double relay.  I plan on swapping
the FI and components, and since my van was carbureted, my fuel pump is not
wired from the double relay.

I am wondering if I just hook up the harness to the coil for power, will my
FI work?  Or what will I need to do electrically to make it so?
