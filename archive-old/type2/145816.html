Subject: 120 connection question

I couldn't find this in the archives, or in the tech library so here it 
is.  I was wondering if the 120 plug into the side of my Riviera should 
be grounded to the chassis?

I've heard differing opinions on this, one person even said that if you 
ground the 120 to the chassis it could screw up your vehicle.

So, should it, or shouldn't it be grounded?
