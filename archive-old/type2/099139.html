Subject: Re: [T2] Suggestions?:covert stereo installation.

In my 71 Westy, I installed a panel between the seats that rested on the
edges of the seal pedestals.  In the front of it, I added holes with
mesh underneath for cups.  Behind that was a flipup panel covered with
carpet- lift it up, and the console faced straight up beneath it. -
actually it was my CB, but you get the idea.  You could step on this or
over it.  The speakers were mounted in that space near the bottom of the
kick panels- sound better than in the door panels.  I cut my own panels
out of plywood paneling.

&gt; Does anybody have any suggestions for where to mount the head unit (stereo)?  I
&gt; think there might be enough room to mount it undeneath the dash and
&gt; fabricate the mount the swing down.  I'm also thinking of building an
&gt; armrest/console the would secure the stereo and keep it hidden.  Both
&gt; options seem like a lot of work.
