Subject: Re: [T2] Transmission questions

Hello Eddie,

I may be mistaken but if the date that is on the plate
behind the driver's seat says 2/74 that means it was
produced in 2/74 which makes your bus is a 75 year
model. I may be wrong but if you think of, say, a 2001
year model car, it first came out on the market in
2000. I could be mistaken, but that is what I thought.
Good luck with your Tranny! If I am mistaken, someone
please correct me. Thanks!

&gt;  I switched transmissions today and some things came
&gt; to my surprise. My
&gt; intent was to replace what I thought to be the
&gt; original gearbox in my '74
&gt; Westy with one that I got from a '73 bus with only
&gt; 92,000 orig miles. (The
&gt; bus was from Nantucket, you can't really drive that
&gt; far there, only in
&gt; circles :) for $150 from the local vw guy. After a
&gt; few hours of pain I had
&gt; the transmissions side by side. The one that I took
&gt; out was a 5 rib
&gt; tranny(!). I thought these were only used in '75.I
&gt; had never really
&gt; given it much notice other than the 002 marking. My
&gt; bus is dated
&gt; 2/74. Did they put 5 rib tranny's into any busses
&gt; previous to 1975, or is
&gt; this not the first transmission that this bus has
&gt; seen?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  There were also a few other differences with the
&gt; transmissions. The
&gt; 5 rib, 002 tranny i took out had
&gt; the ground strap on the driver's side and the '73
&gt; was on the
&gt; opposite. The bus was meant to have it connect on
&gt; the drivers side, I will
&gt; need to make a modification when I am finished
&gt; installing the '73
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  Also There is some kind of sender switch screwed
&gt; into the very
&gt; rear of the '73 tranny (its not the back up light
&gt; switch, this one is on
&gt; the very rear, up and right of the gear shift lever)
&gt; It is 2 prong and has
&gt; a wire on one prong connecting to the same bolt as
&gt; the ground
&gt; strap, obviously a ground connection. The 5 rib
&gt; tranny did not have
&gt; this. What is it?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Some background info that might be useful:
&gt;  it is definately a '74 bus, VIN is '74, door date
&gt; is 2/74 and there were
&gt; no provisions for fuel injection when i got it. It
&gt; does now though. Got it
&gt; with no engine and installed a '75 1800 with all the
&gt; fuel injection. The
&gt; odmeter reads 10,500. This could be 310,500 or even
&gt; more. All I know is
&gt; that in 1985 it had 185,000. The transmission that i
&gt; took out was very
&gt; worn. It was leaking pretty bad, made some awful
&gt; grinding noises and
&gt; didn't like to downshift into 2nd. 
&gt; 
&gt; When I finish with my CV joints (after my axle
&gt; mishap) tomorrow she will
&gt; be with a nice '73 transmission from Nantucket :)
&gt; 
&gt;
