&gt;     My 15 y/o son and I just got back from getting our new to us 1971 Westphalia and we are going to begin the process of getting to know it and restore it.  Just a couple questions that we are wondering about.
&gt;     First, the engine number is not under the generator stand but rather to the left of it and on top of the engine.  The number is U5036389.  I assume this is a type three rebuild.  Do I need to approach it differently for service etc.
&gt;     Second, the generator light came on during the trip.  At first we could tap on the brush on the left side of the generator to make it go out but for the last 400+ miles that did not work.  Any ideas on whether we should just replace it or what.
&gt;     And finally, it has Bn4 gas heater and though I've read all the articles in the library and archives I still don't know if I can remove it to rebuild without taking out the engine.

For your generator, you will need to remove it and have the commutator
machined.  If you simply put in new brushes at this stage it will eat them
up!

There is a way to get the generator out without too much cussing.  Check
the archives for recent discussion on the subject.
