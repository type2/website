Hey, I just finished this job Monday night!

The wife and I went to Home Depot (last year) and went to the area where all 
the kitchen mock-ups are.  We found a rack with samples of formica available 
for recovering counters and saw that they had many wood grain patterns 
available.  Since they didn't have a close enough match to the piece we 
brought with us from the Westy, we selected a bright coloured, realistic 
wood grain formica (like Birch or something) and ordered a 4' x 8' sheet of 
that.  The price ended up being about $80 Cdn (ouch) but thats, what $9 US 
funds (joke, eh!) and it looks great and really brightens up the interior.

The formica is about 1/2 mm thick and is very brittle so it is hard to cut 
without chipping.  We tried a few blades with the jig saw but ended up using 
a dremel with a diamond type bit and a screw-on support to keep it 90 
degrees from the surface.  We then sand down the edges to be smooth.  We 
used LePage's rubber cement from the same Home Depot to glue the new formica 
on (and I wore latex gloves to keep the mess off me).  You will need to get 
all the old formica (or formica-type material) off the surface first (to get 
it even) and this was by far the most frusterating part.  I used a putty 
knife to lift the old stuff off (if you do this, be careful because it can 
slip and slice you pretty badly).

If you do it this way and are careful, the results will look pretty 
professional because the factory used something similar in the first place.
