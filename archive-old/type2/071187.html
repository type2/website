&lt;&lt; Having never honed cylinders before &gt;&gt;

I have on the 'regular' inline 4s, V6s, and V8s because it wasn't
economically feasible to replace an engine block.  With the cost
of Type Is and even Type IV P&amp;C kits being what they are I
wouldn't recommend honing old cylinders.  The cost of a new
set of graphite coated Type I P/Cs is less than a decent drill
and 3-finger hone.  And if you are dead set on honing you'll
need to get a bore gauge to check to ensure that you haven't
tapered the cylinder bore.  Unless your old cylinders are perfect
then you can probably get by with a 'dingle-ball' type hone and
use your old bent shaft drill.  But when its all said and done its
still cheaper and better to go with new parts.

YMMV
