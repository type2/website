 for that article and for the Volkswoman column, I 
 know Lois, and as far as that article is 
 concerned I think I wasted my money.

I, too was dissappointed with that issue.  It had been a while since I'd last 
picked up a VW Trends and I wonder--when did it become such a weasly 
magazine? 
 I think it has way too European of a flavor.  I mean, even giving European 
specs on the Bus?  Come on!  It seems obvious to me that the folks there 
either don't know their VWs or don't care to.
The VW Trends that I remember from a few years ago was much better.  
I'm not saying that I could do a better job, but it's a national magazine, 
for goodness sakes!  At least try to get the facts straight.
The best thing in that issue was the double cab boat on the last page.  I'd 
like to see that one in person.
