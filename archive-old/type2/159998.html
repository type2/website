Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield seal redux...

&gt; My new seal was big and unruly, but no way was it 11' big.
&gt; Where'd your seal come from?
&gt; 
&gt; The seal is about 8 feet around...The windshield is about
11 feet around...(tape measurements...)
If this is right, I'll continue...Like I said, I got the seal years
ago from BD, but never got around to using it on another
Bus...It &quot;may&quot; be the wrong seal or it may hafta stretch
that much to go on the windshield...I don't have a bench-
mark to judge it against...
