&gt;that the highest point in the country was the top of a dike [
&gt;or perhaps a windmill :) ].....

Well not quite, we do have some hills but most are very low (300 ft max).
The highest point is approx 1000 ft (in the southernmost part of Holland,
actually that is the province of Limburg on the boarder with Germany and
Belgium).

And also think about all that very conguested traffic on these quaint old
bridges in Amsterdam! Some of them have steep approaches that can make your
bus 'fly' if you take them too fast. So we get plenty of practice.

BTW - I found driving in rushhour traffic in LA or SF easy compared to
Amsterdam! I enjoyed the hills in SF (never rolled back). But then again
Amsterdam is heaven compared to Paris. It really is true, the French drive
like crazy with absolute disregard to expensive material objects like brand
new cars let alone old VW buses.
