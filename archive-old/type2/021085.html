&gt; my first question: does it matter that the sparkplugs are two different
&gt; sizes?

What do you mean by 2 different sizes,,, the threads are physically different,,
or the heat range is different,, on thread is longer than the other,,,

Can you send the actual number off the side,,, like Bosch W8CC  or, W225T2 or
champion L88 or what ever,,,those numbers are for a T4 engine,, not a T1 as you
have,

What My guess is that you have an insert that has come out with the sparkplug,,
and if you read the plug number, they will all be the same.
