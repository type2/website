you can unbolt the rocker-arm assembly and work on it from there.

Basically: there are two 13mm nuts which hold the whole rocker arm 
assembly (the things that the valve adjust screws are in) to the head.

Remove these nuts and washers, put them in a safe place, pull the 
rocker arm assembly off and look at the broken off bolt.  If the bolt 
protrudes from the other side of the rocker arm, you may be able to 
either screw two nuts on it and thread it out, or, get a set of 
vice-grips on it and unscrew it that way.  If you can't do that, the 
next simplest thing is probably to pick up a new rocker arm assembly 
from somewhere (or somebody on the list).  I probably have one handy 
that I can send you if no one else can.

Good luck!
