Boy, some of us are deranged.  Just two days ago I picked up my 
part bus's removed heater control valve and looked into it.  It had rubber 
gaskets on both sides of the flapper valve.  In one position It 
closes off the vent to atmosphere, and the other closes off the 
passage to the front.  Who else would look in there, just for FUN?
Didn't bother to check how I'd repair it though, as it was intact.

&gt; the metal valve with no cover so I assume either some didn't come with this
&gt; or the rubber disintigrates and &quot;disappears&quot; over time.
&gt; 
&gt; To get to the valve you'd have to disassemble the flapper box anyhow so it
&gt; would probably not be worth the bother to repair (and besides, the heat leak
&gt; would be so miniscule I wouldn't think it would be relevant).   I'm just
&gt; curious if these items are even available or if someone can come up with a
&gt; justification for installing them :).
