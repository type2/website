Subject: Hippy Bus

I finally made some new stickers that yu might get a kick out of:

&quot; I beat up 4 hippies and all I got was this dumb BUS!&quot;

&quot;NON-HIPPY BUS&quot;

&quot;Fast Cars Suck&quot;

Need your opinions, a few people have asked me for an old sticker that used
to say,  &quot; It's not a Van, it is a BUS&quot;    would that be a worthwile one to
print?
I must say, everytime people on the list refer to their VAN, I puke and
wonder how I got on the FORD list.

&quot;HIppy Bus&quot; is also available, with little VW flowers all over it.

Ask Jim Thompson-Old Volks Home  for these stickers, he distributes them.

Yes,   &quot;NEVER GET BEHIND A VW BUS&quot; is one of mine also.

God bless your weekend, and do a valve in my name
