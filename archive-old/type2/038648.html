&gt;The White LED's give a lot of useful, visible light.  While some of the

&gt;brighter than others even though they have the same MCD rating. Regardless of
&gt;what a light meter says, how they eye sees the light is what counts.  Most of
&gt;the people who have seen the white LED
&gt;s say they look brighter than the red or yellow LED's..
&gt;at this time there are only two places to find white LED's As they become
&gt;more popular they will become easier to find...Try:

If you want white light and LEDs are not a requirement, Radio Shack sells 
12v incandescent &quot;microbulbs&quot; (grain-o-wheat) for $1.49/pair.  Many car 
stereos have these from the factory to light up the display.
