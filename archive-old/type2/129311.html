Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Issues

CB is 10 degrees after.  Don't try and advance it any more unless you 
want to kill your engine really quickly, especially if you add the 
vacuum advance line (which you should).

Again, you don't tune your engine according to what distributor is 
installed, you tune it according to your engine model.

&gt; Eureaka! The taste of success is sweet after over a year, my newfound 
&gt; friends!
&gt; 
&gt; On the suggestion of Jeff, I checked all the intake connections, couldnt 
&gt; find anything.  It made sense that too much air was the problem, since 
&gt; it was only at idle.  Therefore, I took off the brake booster line, and 
&gt; sealed it off with a bolt and more electrical tape than one man has any 
&gt; business using.  Fired it back up, and bam!  Smooth as butter (well, 
&gt; butter after you drop it in some gravel).  I still dont know about the 
&gt; timing, it seems to run well at about 8BTDC, with the advance plugged.
