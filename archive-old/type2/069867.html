Those guys have the more expensive car.  They do not want to hit you.  They
know it.  They know that your VW is paid for, but their, uh, Nissan Altima still
has, uh, $13,000 to go.  They also know that your bus is made of steel.

I used to Loooove driving my 1959 impala.  That thing has HARPOONS!  I called it
&quot;Can opener&quot;.  One time somebody in a Camaro hit me broadside.  It Trassshed her
fiberglass front end.  She looked at me and my giant car (the big green 4-dr
impala must have been something to see from that perspective) and she ran away at
high speed.

There's a fine line between courage and foolishness.  Too bad it's not a
fence.
