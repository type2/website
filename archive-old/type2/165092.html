Subject: [T2] Electric conversion... Thanks!

This is a big THANK YOU to all who responded concerning my post.  The big 
questions remain (1)horsepower requirements, (2)how much energy one can store 
for a given weight, and (3)control apparatus for DC motors.  Regarding (1)...

Sure, I remember trying to drive on the Pennsy turnpike in a 36 hp Type 2 
circa 1958.  With the help of a good tailwind, we could hit ~50 mph on a 
downhill. I'm bloody lucky to be alive... not that friendly truckers didn't 
have their laughs.

But my need is for a local commute, 30 mph max.  AYMK... Electric motors have 
high starting torque because of the back-EMF contribution (actually absent at 
zero revs).  The idea is that a generator and motor are much the same.  A motor 
begins to act like a generator, opposing the current you try to push through it 
for propelling the microbus...  What this means: you can push fairly enormous 
currents into the motor at starting time.  The railroads converted to diesel-
electrics that had lower horsepower ratings than the grand old steamers they 
replaced.  The Electro-Motive F3 [ABBA] produced 5400 hp, sometimes replacing 
two a good old 4-8-4 Northerns easily worth 6000 hp each when they got up to 
speed.  Because of the starting characteristics of electric motors, the F3 
didn't have to take slack [jerking the train] to get the train rolling.... 

Y'all have given me some interesting references.  The VW electrobus on FleaBay 
was fun to read about, confirming the lead/acid battery weight vs energy 
storage considerations.  

Thanks again to all, and have a great day!
