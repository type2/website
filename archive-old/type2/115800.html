&gt; Hmm... I know that I have a 1.8. It's a GEX rebuild. It also has hydraulic
&gt; lifters too.

when i said AW i meant stock from the factory in that series of case. who
knows what rebuilders do, most of the motors around these days have been
rebuilt at least once.

i doubt any volume rebuilder like GEX would use sodium valves due to them
costing so much more that standard valves.
