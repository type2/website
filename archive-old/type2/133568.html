Subject: Re: [T2] John Brown's Buses

just a quick note, just got in from a day in Harpers Ferry W.Va.  think
there were dern near as many Canadians as Americans down for this shindig.

And Gregg and the rest of his Family whipped up an awesome pancake
breakfast this Sat morning.  more Bacon, Sausages, pancakes than I think I
have ever seen in one place, there was even some Spam........

Adoom also of Canada did the T-shirts and they are some of the spiffiest
shirts I've seen in quite a while, they were advance order only and folks
who didn't order one really missed out.

lots of talk and engine and bus inspections.  someone whipped up a chili
for lunch (sorry missed who it was) that is gonna be a contender at
Everybus.

just about 4 PM a storm came up and sent everyone scurrying and I hit the
road about that time but about 40 buses showed up, even Steve Dolan put in
an appearance.

Jamie,  you out did yourself,  Thanks for a great day and weekend. their
gonna talk about this one for awhile

sorry I couldn't stay the whole weekend so I'm sure folks will post a more
complete report in a couple days.

get your palm pilots' and date books out and fill in the date the moment
Jamie announces next years get together (And I sure hope there is one)

Bob
