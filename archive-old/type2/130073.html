&gt; &gt; I just called Safelite...They
&gt; &gt; had to install mine 5 times and used three seals and two windshields before

&gt; &gt; until it stopped leaking. The last time they did it the guy had me come in
&gt; &gt; on a Saturday afternoon when they were closed and he spent about 4 hours
&gt; &gt; working on it. He ended up having to use a belt sander to adjust the
&gt; &gt; perimeter of the windshield and some funky stuff on the edge of the seal to
&gt; &gt; get it to bond cleanly with the paint. All for about the same cost as a
&gt; &gt; windshield plain. And you can pick from clear or partial tint.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm, sounds like Safelite windshields aren't shaped quite right!  This
&gt;description sounds like the first and last time I will ever install a
&gt;Mexican muffler on a VW.  I'd pay a lot more for a part that actually fit
&gt;right!

I asked him about that, thinking that they were trying to shoehorn in a 
piece that wasn't right. The installer said that most of the windshields 
are made by two different manufacturers (slight differences in the cutting 
molds) and he said that most windshields on older cars need some tweaking. 
He never sanded off more than 1/8 inch, usually right around the corners. 
As cars get older and accumulate miles they can sag, get tweaked from heavy 
loads and bad roads and repairs can affect the dimensions as well. I 
figured that when busses were made all over the world and over a 10 year 
span that variances will often pop up. It is Murphy's rule that tolerances 
stack up so the installer needs some way to adjust the tolerances. That way 
is the special water cooled belt sander.

He must have done something right. It has been about 5 years now and I 
haven't had a drop come in the windshield on a bus that lives outside.
