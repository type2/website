&gt; When I had my 78x88 type I engine built for my '71 westy, my mechanic
&gt; insisted I get a lightened flywheel. I was skeptical, because I had read an
&gt; article in Hot VW's magazine that said that a lightened flywheel had to be
&gt; removed from their westy because of stalling.  However, I have plenty of low
&gt; speed and uphill grunt (I regularly go over steep hills and occassionly over
&gt; a 10,000 foot pass in the Sierras).  I have never stalled the engine.  The
&gt; engine has a Scat forged counterweighted crank and a Berg 6 pound pulley,
&gt; the combination of which easily outweighs the metal removed from the
&gt; lightweight flywheel.  I don't think there is an easy answer, you should
&gt; weigh all the factors,

Remember that the rotating inertia of the flywheel depends not only upon
the mass of the metal, but on the rotating radius.  Taking metal off of
the flywheel and putting it into the crank will not yield the same amount
of rotating inertia.

In normal operation, there is no reason to run a lightened flywheel.  The
only applications where a lightened flywheel is a good idea is those where
you want the engine to rev up rapidly, such as drag racing.  I doubt that
the flywheel weight has much effect on the acceleration of a bus, even
with a modified engine.  It will make a difference in drivability, as the
flywheel is there to keep the engine running smoothly and lightening it
will make the bus easier to stall, though buses are not all that easy to
stall due to the gearing.

Better to leave it stock, IMO
