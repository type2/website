Took my bus on my first trip--about 120 miles, everything went
perfectly. I had a few problems downshifting into second--wouldn't go in
until vehicle speed was about 10 mph.

About 60 miles into the return trip I either lost all my gears or got
stuck in 3rd. Not liking any of my alternatives vis-a-vis towing/rescue,
I opted to drive home in 3rd gear. A new clutch is probably in the stars
for me.

Judging from the archives, it sounds like something rather simple has
gone amiss inside the nosecone. (There is a fairly healthy oil leak
there now, it seems.) But before I pull engine and tranny, what should I
be inspecting? Is there something I should be looking at closer to the
shifter?
