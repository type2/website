        Most humble appologies.

        When I read the original message, my eyes bugged out, my teeth
gnashed, I was enraged.  I, most evidently, dirrected my anger, in error,
toward the messenger (by tagging you as the originator) along with the message.

        I will stand by my response, as it does express how I feel about she
socal elites who feel that any phesant who is detered by the near 30k price
of a new car (if I even wanted one, well maby a westyEV, I also saw a camper
package land rover with a poptop in Ashland OR, looked good...real
good)should walk to, and while at, work. Forgo recreation entirely.  And
rember to walk with thier heads down and shoulders stooped while in the the
presence of thier betters(as defined by the socal elite butheads that wrote
the original article).

        Eyes are starting to bug out, teeth are starting to gnash, time to
sighn off.

        Scott, seriously, humble appologies.
Robert Crawford
