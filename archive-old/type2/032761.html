Subject: Re: Source for fabric? (Westy curtain butterscotch plaid)

&gt;I too would really like to find a source for the original type curtains
&gt;for a late 60's to early 70's bus.  From what I hear this fabric is in
&gt;fairly high demand.  Is there any chance that some big bus parts
&gt;distributor might be willing to have some of the fabric custom made?
&gt;(Bus Depot, Bus Boys, PLF- are you out there - what about it?)
&gt;
&gt;I, for one, would probably be willing to prepay for my share of the order
&gt;prior to manufacture.  How about anyone else?


Count me in, I purchased some of the orange seat material for my '67 Westy
when it came up on the list and would do the same for some curtain material.
