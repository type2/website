Subject: Re: [T2] Kombi Nation

There was a show on here in the states that was kinda like the show
described. it did come from europe and it was a Real World meets Road Trip.
I never saw the name of the show but caught the last 35 minutes. I have
always been looking for it again, so i hope that this might be it.. now to
go search Kazaa and Winmx for the show.

As for playing it if it comes to DVD or if you can get it sent to you on DVD
format or VCD/SVCD format

The English and most European countries use the PAL format, but most current
DVD playersthat can play VCD and SVCD's will still play the movie other then
the picture may be square as they use a 480X480 pixel settings and USA uses
352X240 pixels to give us a more widescreen version. But on the plus side
PAL is more vivid and allows for more info in the mpeg stream. so when you
zoom in on something..it takes longer to go blocky (good for spotting VW's
in the background)
