Subject: Parts FS (Knoxville show)

After cleaning out the garage to work on the '64 Deluxe, I realized 
I have a bunch of stuff I may never use and I could use some more 
room!

Here are some things I could take to the Knoxville show if anyone 
is interested:

Brand new Wolfsburg West 62-67 nose skin

Brand new Sewfine grey cloth headliner for hardtop split bus

Westy interior from '69 (same layout '68-72)

Deluxe Westy interior from '79 (same layout '76-79)

Camp stool from '73 Westy (butterscotch fabric upholstery)

several Westy bug screens

Several Westy child's cots (fit '68-73 for sure, sometime after that 
the clip positions were changed, so the rod length changed)

Lots of Westy louvered windows (I have several sets from '64-79)

A pair of low hinge split panel cargo doors I would LOVE to trade 
for a pair of early split high hinge panel cargo doors.

Lots of miscellaneous bits &amp; pieces, if you have a need, I may have it.

Time to lighten my load!

Dave
