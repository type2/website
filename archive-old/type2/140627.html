Subject: Fw: [T2] Devon Interior

I actually have an interior from a 62 devon - i'm in the process of pulling 
it out - it is missing a few parts and I disassembled the back over the 
engine bay cabinet with out taking enough pics - now a month has passed and 
I'm kinda unsure as tho how it goes together.  It has a long board that goes 
across and two (I think) cabinets that go on either side.

 Maybe the most informative site I found was this
 http://www_dot_devonmoonraker.pwp.blueyonder.co_dot_uk/OthersalesBrochures.html

 But I'd still like to find some nice pics of the inside of a restored or
 original devon caravette.

&gt;&gt; So if you really want to find early Devon, you've got to make sure it's 
&gt;&gt; early Devon. Otherwise, be satisfied looking at the baywindow examples.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyone from U.K./Europe want to dispute or confirm?
