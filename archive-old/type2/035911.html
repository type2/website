Subject: RE: battery

Hmm... what made you replace your battery in the first place?  You don't say
what you have done to trace the fault.  The best thing to do is firstly to
connect an ammeter in circuit with the battery (either + or - side will do)
to find out how much current is being drained when the ignition is off.
Then try pulling fuses one by one to see which circuit is causing the drain.
Cleaning up the connections is a good idea, except that in your case it will
make the battery drain quicker.

&gt; I installed a new battery last wed.
&gt; Everything worked great for a couple of days.  Now my battery seems to
&gt; drain overnight.  I cant find the source of the problem.
