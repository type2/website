&gt; OK, a few more questions: What is the little gray bag for? You show it on
&gt; your picture, I have it on the 69 Cabinet I have, but it is not on my 71 or
&gt; 73 cabinet.

It covers the end of the front cot that hangs over the edge of the
cabinet.  Often destroyed by this time.

&gt; Also, what year were the grab handles added? Yours has none, my 69 part has
&gt; none, but I see them on my 71 cabinet and on others 71s. 

Grab handles? Where??  Oh.  The white thing like on the driver side?
Never seen them on the cabinet.

dunno.
