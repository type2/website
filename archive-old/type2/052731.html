&gt; The shifting is really hard.
&gt; It goes into gear, but you have to force it the whole way, and it stops 
&gt; wherever you leave it.
&gt; 
&gt; It's as if the bottom of the shifter is loaded with frozen tar, making any 
&gt; movement in any direction nearly impossible. Make sense?

Well, the shift linkage seems to be the logical place.  Disconnect the
shift coupler at the front of the transmission and see if the lever moves
freely.  If it does, you have a problem in the transmission.  If not, you
have a rust/lube probelem in the linkage.  Don't force things.  You don't
want to break the linkage!

You might also have a bad front transmission mount.  This is a visual
check, so you might do this before moving onward.
