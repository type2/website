Subject: Charity??!! keep it!


----------
life ain't Disney World!  Love your bus, but be
realistic.  I'll save my 
charity for the starving people in the third world.
-----------
  
AIRS isnt CHARITY and if you dont get it I feel
sorry for you. Hope you never break down on the West
coast... Would hate to belittle you with our charity!
If YOU have a bus.. the only time you can for certain
always make it back home is if you only drive it back
and forth in your driveway! Goes for Toyotas too.
  You take road trips to Safeway only, or what? Geeez
