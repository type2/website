Subject: Holiday Bus Fest!

First Notice!

Michele and I are hosting the Second Annual Mid-Atlantic Holiday Bus
Fest on Sunday, December 15th, from 1-4PM at the usual place, our
home in Takoma Park MD, near Washington DC. 

We will supply chili, beer, hot apple cider, plus various sweets. Feel
free to bring food and drink to share. If you are considering travelling
from a distance, e-mail direct to arrange crashing/camping space, or
whatever. Signficant others, kids, etc are welcome and indeed encouraged
to attend. 

All buses driven to the site must be available for inspection, show and
tell, accolades, and commiseration. Walking tours to visit the Derelict
'64  ( http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/derelict.htm ) and furnace
installation seminars will also be available.

I'll post a reminder and directions closer to the date.

Mark those calendars now!

Tom F.
