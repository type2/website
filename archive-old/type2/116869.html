Subject: Oil Pressure Sender Instl - Disaster Averted!

Sorry for the length of this message!  Found a potentially big problem on my 
79 bus this weekend and I thought I'd pass the info along since I know 
others also have this oil pressure sender installation set-up.

Less than 20K miles ago, I installed my VDO oil pressure sender on my 2.0l 
engine using a 1/8 NPT brass pipe (3 inch long) tapped straight into the 
case oil pressure port with a 45 degree elbow at the top where the sender 
was mounted.  A few months back, the bus starting leaking oil (more than 
usual) which led me to believe &quot;It's those d**n pushrod tube seals again!&quot;  
Well, I finally got a break from the kids this weekend and checked into it.  
Saw new oil leak traces around the base of the oil pressure sender pipe 
extension (at the case) and decided to replace it.  When removing the sender 
from the top of the pipe extension assembly, the extension pipe broke off in 
my hand at the case leaving the remaining pipe threads in the case!  The 
pipe had a on-going fatigue crack that started at the base of one of the 
thread cuts and had cracked half-way around the pipe by the time I caught 
it.  This thing was VERY close to coming off on its own!  I suspect that the 
weight of the sender shaking around on the top of the extension pipe for all 
of those miles took is toll and fatigued the pipe out.

After removing the broken-off tip of pipe from the case with an &quot;easy-out&quot; 
(which for me, I might add, was like performing open heart surgery), I 
replaced the whole assembly with the &quot;grease gun&quot; hose set-up discussed in 
the archives.  My FLAPS had a 1/8 NPT female to M10-1.0 male adapter for the 
case and a 12 inch grease gun hose (1/8 NPT threaded) to attach to it.  With 
the adapter, the hose threads right into the case nicely.  Got a 1/8 NPT 
union and EMT metal conduit clamp at Homey D's for attaching the hose to the 
sender and to mount the sender to the engine.  The hose is just long enough 
to nicely run from the oil pressure port, around to the left and aft of the 
dizzy, to a mounting location on the fan housing near where the flap control 
rod comes out of the cooling tin.  The EMT clamp mounts here to an existing 
threaded hole in the fan housing that looks like it was designed for the 
purpose; with the clamp turned at a 45-degree angle the fan housing, there 
is no interference with the cooling tin.  The metal clamp also provides the 
ground for the sender.  The completed installation looks factory and is very 
secure.  Engine vibrations at the oil pressure port are damped out by the 
hose itself.  If you decide to install this set-up, you may want to pick up 
a P/N 360009 VDO pressure sender (with idiot light contact; about $28) that 
has a 1/8 NPT thread on it and will mate better with the 1/8 NPT union on 
the hose.  The P/N 360006 sender sold at VW outlets in M10-1.0 threaded.

The whole new set-up cost less than $20.  I'll keep checking it to confirm 
that it works OK.  Should be OK, but then again I never thought I'd have a 
problem with the old set-up.  YMMV.
