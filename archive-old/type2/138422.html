Subject: Early poptop canvas

I'm going to be redoing my poptop canvas fairly soon (as soon as I get 
the engine done, back in, and get the roof painted).

It has always seemed to me that if you don't have a kid small enough to 
fit in the cot up there, the stock canvas in the early poptops is quite 
a bit less than ideal. What I have had in mind as a replacement is to 
go &quot;modular,&quot; meaning there would be a fixed part of the canvas, and 
interchangeable panels. The fixed part is to be of sunbrella fabric 
(this is what one aftermarket canvas-maker uses) and would resemble a 
sort of frame, with four-inch (finished) strips all around. All of the 
screws and staples would go into this.

At the openings that remain I'd have velcro and flaps (for weather 
proofing). And there would be a choice of panels: either screens, or 
&quot;weather&quot; panels, that could be changed back and forth, depending on 
conditions. I'd probably use the screens through three seasons, and put 
in the others in the winter.

The only that bothers me about this design is that the velcro would be 
under tension between the long horizontal edges. These could be 
reinforced with snaps, or something of the sort. Maybe even three or 
four of those plastic buckles that are used on packs. I'm dubious about 
zippers.

Putting a sort of strap of sunbrella vertically in the middle of the 
side panels is another option. That would effectively break the sides 
into two &quot;windows&quot; each.

I welcome other suggestions.
