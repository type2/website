Subject: Junk (er, good stuff!) for sale

I posted about this a bit ago, but didn't have pictures.

I need to unload a Vanagon camper interior, a Vanagon shell, as well as 
possibly sell my '77 'Loaf (looking for feelers).  If you are interested in 
anything you see, let me know. 77 needs a new head. Vanagon is missing the 
engine and tranny. Jetta will likely be getting a rollcage for it's new life as 
a Rally car :)

To this end, I put some pictures in http://aukcycles_dot_com/vw

I'm currently in Iowa. I can crate and ship.  If you have experience with 
trying to get rid of similar items, I would appreciate knowing if this is all 
futile and it should just find a dumpster somewhere.

I promise this is the last time you'll see this particular combination of fine 
German craftsmanship offered.

As always, e-mail me for questions, and thanks for reading.

Matt
