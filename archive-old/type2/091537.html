Subject: Bad day on I-15 near Centerville, UT

Bus started missing and bucking, so I pulled over to
check it out (really didn't have a choice).
Then it wouldn't CRANK! Good battery, good connections
and the starter whirled when i shorted the contacts.
On a last try the starter managed to crank and start
the engine and then dead. Bad selenoid, I figured.

So, I had a bus with some kind of fuel or electrical
problem that was causing it to miss and die. But I
couldn't crank the engine to even start figuring it
out. Plus the highway noise was deafening--couldn't
hear the engine if it did start.And I had my kids with
me.

Then, a friendly State trooper told me to move it off
the highway or get tagged.

Here's the good luck part: Begged a little time. Kids
and I hiked to a bus stop and got home. (They were
great, thought it was just another VW adventure.)

I went back and got the bus towed.
 
Long story short: It was NOT the selenoid, it was the
ignition switch! I'm putting in a tractor starter
button I had in the parts box.

Then, I'll start figuring out what the missing is all
about.

Kinda bummed. First time I haven't been able to limp
home under my own power.
