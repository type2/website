Subject: 71 Westy Repairs (LONG)

Hello all.  Well once again I am composing this message on my word 
processor and hoping that the word wrap feature will work unlike my 
rotten text editor that I normally use where I have to &lt;CR&gt; every line.

I've been working on my 71 Westy and I thought I would tell about 
how it's been going so far in hopes that it will benefit anyone who 
wishes to read.

I wrote this post once already and now I can't find where I saved it so 
here I go again. :-(

It all started a week ago when I wished to reboot and grease my CV 
joints.  I figured I could get this done in a weekend no problem but of 
course, one thing has led to another.  First the drive axle on the 
passenger side came off and I cleaned it all up and regreased and 
rebooted everything but somewhere along the line, I noticed my rear 
wheel had some play in it.  Removal of the axle nut entailed getting a 
1 13/16 socket with a 3/4 drive t-bar of my grandfather's and using a 
4 foot cheater to break it loose.  I did this to the other side as well 
because I always do bearings in pairs.  I've done this rear bearing 
thing 2 times on bugs but never on a T2.  It's the same except for 
that my stub shaft housing didn't have notches for a punch to slide 
into to help punch the bearing out.  Being very careful to not drive a 
punch through my bearing, I got one out and then using a god-send 
tool of mine (just a piece of pipe with a nice rounded edge), I was 
able to drive out the other bearing.  The pipe is &quot;EXACTLY&quot; the size 
of a bearing so you only hit on the outer edge and not on the moving 
parts that are closer to the center.  It was apparent by the caked 
grease that this rear end needed to be relubed.  The original VW 
bearings were in this housing and they still look good.  I'm sure they 
are worn but I went ahead and cleaned them up, cleaned the housing 
they fit in to, and reinstalled them.  I'm using a bucket of black 
hi-temp disc brake and wheel bearing grease.  Man it's sticky stuff 
and it takes about 3 times with dishwashing soap to remove it from 
my hands.  I was able to get this stuff at a big automotive store not 
far from Mr.VW's house when I visited him in August.  Anyway, I 
moved on to the other side.  

Now the PO had told me that he had a bearing replaced by a 
mechanic and so I assumed that by the lack of lube on the 
passenger rear, that the driver's side would be the side with the 
replacement bearing.  After pulled the drive axle, I located a bad CV 
but I'll get to that in a little bit.  I pulled the bearings out and they are 
stamped, &quot;Made in France TIMKEN.&quot;  So  this was the replacement 
side but the workmanship was so shoddy that the mechanic should 
have been ashamed with his work.  First off I noticed that there was 
no inner grease seal installed so that gravel and rocks were allowed 
to cake around the bearing.  Fortunately it is still firm as ever but I 
don't see how it managed to not self-destruct.  Then, the outer 
bearing dropped 5 of the rollers as soon as the stub shaft came out - 
just great!   I went ahead and cleaned up the CV's from this side and 
found that one bearing was stuff and had obviously ran hot because 
it had a bluish tint to it.  The balls were seized in the cage and one 
ball had a pit mark in it.  I suspect someone switched balls in this CV 
or mixed and matched parts.  I've never felt a CV with such rotten 
mobility as this one.  I'd grab the shaft and try to swing it around and 
the CV would lock up and I'd have to get a hammer and tap lightly to 
break it loose.  I've got a new CV on the way as well.
To top it all off, whoever lubed the CV's last only put on enough 
grease to lube the CV and the inside of the CV boots was dry.  I kid 
you not - dry rubber.  Common sense dictates you must put grease 
down in the boot.

Well at this point I was in a bind - no parts immediately available to 
install, so my rusted out rear shocks beckoned me and complained 
about the saggy ass.  Following the suggestions from several listees 
on the Type2 list, I got the NAPA coil over shocks.  I paid $44.95 each 
and got them the next day.  

Well it was apparent with the test fit that the springs were going to 
rub alongside the frame and the shock mount so I made a 1/4&quot; 
spacer to offset the shock.  The other problem was the metal 
bushing inside the rubber bushing of the new shocks was too long 
and made my bolt too short.  So using 2 sockets and a vise, I made a 
homemade press and pressed the bushing from my old shocks into 
the new.  It makes the bolt head sink every so slightly into the rubber 
shock bushing but it gave me the extra bolt I needed to fasten the 
shocks in the bus.  It was this point that I found the upper mount on 
the passenger side had been damaged and replaced with a 
homemade plate of some sort.  It's worked so far so whatever.  I 
can't wait to cruise with pride - my ass in the air and my head 
cocked back flaring my pug nose around. (just kidding)

I turned my attention to the front end and repacked the front wheel 
bearings.  I used twine to hold the calipers to the upper shock 
mount.  The only problem encountered here was that the outer 
passenger wheel bearing was gritty.  Even though it was apparent 
that the bearing had been done recently, this bearing was had.  I 
found metal flakes in the bottom of my solvent pan and the surfaces 
of the bearing and the race told me that this bearings' time was up.
I was further shocked when the FLAPS had a T2 outer bearing in 
stock and SKF nonetheless.  Although my friendly Mexican 
neighbors had taken pride in this design, I installed it along with the 
new race and after reassembling everything and brake-cleening it 
all, I have a nice rollable front end.  The only thing left to do up front 
is to replace the shocks and the dampener (the shocks are so rusty 
as well as the dampener, they're probably the originals - I can't 
believe they've been left on as long as they have been.)

Amidst all this fun, I suggested to my grandfather that if it wasn't for 
the time factor, I'd fix my ebrake.  He said, &quot;Who's in a hurry?&quot;  So 
very kind of him...  He's spent 2 days freeing up my rear brake 
adjustors (I finally caught him using my impact tools - he can't get 
over how fast I get things done and now his skepticism has turned 
into appreciativeness.)  I guess the impact hammer helped to free 
the adjustors and now he's got them all anti-seized.  I also refilled 
the tranny with synthetic tranny fluid.  I also was able to remove 
both ebrake cables and their flex tubes (impact hammer with a chisel 
bit) and am hoping that when this is all over with, I'll have an 
operative ebrake system again.  I can't imagine how I've managed 
this long without it.

Thanks to Fred Stoermer (sp?), I got my RECMAR hooks from some 
supply place in Nashville, TN.  I ordered them a long time ago and 
then about a week ago, they came in the mail with an apology from 
the post office.  Apparently, the Nashville store just put them in a 
plain envelope and a postal machine someplace tore the envelope 
open and separated the hooks from the envelope.  Anyway, they do 
fit in the Westy curtain track.   The only curtain I'm missing is the one 
in front of the sliding door.  I usually hang a sheet here but it gets to 
be annoying when I'm stark naked and I snag the damn sheet and rip 
it down.  Fortunately I'm not aware of any reports of sudden 
blindness or corrupted children but it's a risk I hate living with.
So my kind grandmother and her sewing skills went to work on a 
curtain.  It's made out of a plain white muslin material and she's got 
all the hooks on it.  I'm going to put velcro under the louvered 
window and on the face of the curtain and that way I can secure the 
curtain from any peeping toms and keep it out of the way (the 
curtain hangs straight down but the bus curves outward slightly.)
Since grandma has some extra muslin left over, she's sewing 
pockets on the back of the curtain so that I can put a map, 
deodorant, and toothbrush w/paste etc in the curtain itself.  It's just 
for light duty stuff - I don't want to rip the hooks out or anything like 
that.  It's a great way to add space.

Anyway, my grandma was concerned that the curtain wouldn't 
match the bus or that it would look out of place and here's what I 
said, &quot;I like it this way grandma.  That's what makes the bus special 
- it gives it a homey atmosphere and in a way, keeps the bus 
original.&quot;  So my bus will have my grandmother and grandfather's 
handiwork in it.  I hope I can get grandma in it once for a ride before 
her time comes.  She seems to like it so well and seems so happy for 
me.  

One more thing before I close, my grandma is 80 years old and she 
also patched the holes caused by obvious abuse in the front curtain.  
She put new elastic in it and somewhere along the line, the elastic 
had gone out, and someone ripped holes in the curtain and hung it 
over the ends of the visors.  This is yet another aspect of the bus 
that gives it a homey atmosphere.

This is what I've been doing with a good deal of my time lately.  I just 
wanted to keep you all posted and hope you didn't mind the 
additional comments I threw in that weren't necessary but yet 
important to me.

Thanks for reading!

Slater...
