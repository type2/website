&gt; Subject: high idle speed on 77 F.I.

&gt; Help!  My 77 F.I. bus has a high idle speed and I can't figure out why.  I've
&gt; got the idle speed screw cranked all the way in and the idle is still 1500.  I
&gt; have the Bently manual and I went through their diagnostic chart.  The
&gt; auxiliary air regulator, decel valve, and fuel pressure are all good.  The oil
&gt; breather line is also good and the S tube is in good shape.  The EGR line is
&gt; plugged.  I also checked inside the throttle plate and it looks good.  I'm
&gt; stumped.  Anyone else have ideas?

--&gt; Did you check to make sure the throttle plate is closing fully?  Mine
used to routinely stick in a just-barely-open position and give me an idle
at about 1500 rpm.  I can't imagine you haven't checked this, but
sometimes the obvious gets overlooked.
