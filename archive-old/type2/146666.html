Subject: Portland magician

Hi -

I have a question to pose to the folks in Portland, Oregon:  There is a 
mechanic I've heard about who is supposed to do magic with VW's of all 
kinds, and I cannot recall his name - it is something like Grafton, 
Safton or something like that.  I believe he has a shop somewhere 
between Portland and Gresham, but I'm not certain.  Anyone out there 
familiar with this guy?

Thanks,
Kurt Selvig
Portland, OR
