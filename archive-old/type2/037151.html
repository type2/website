+AD4-Hi,
+AD4-
+AD4-I cannot remove the backing plate from the cable (or vice versa).

Jen, if you've got the same set up as in my 79, the backing plate forms a
tube into which a solid lump of metal fits which the cable slides through.

The lump of metal is the bit you can't get out, and it's much easier if you
still have the backing plate in place.

When I fitted new cables, the old ones came out reasonably easy once I'd got
some WD40 on them then attacked them with a pair of mole grips. Just waggle
them round whilst pulling out. The new ones were a real tight fit and if the
last owner has just wacked them in I can understand your problem. To get
mine to fit I had to file metal off .

Good Luck

Andy Vevers
