Subject: Re:timing advance question

Todd,
    I recently installed a new 1600 from Bob Donalds of  Boston
Engine.  The instructions he gave me said to set the timing so the
TOTAL advance, vacuum and mechanical combined, is 32 degrees at about
3500 RPM.  For the dizzy that's in my bus, from a 74 beetle if I
remember right. it reaches full advance at less than 3500 rpm.  So I
run the engine up to 3500RPM and hold it there while I turn the dizzy
to set the 32 degrees.  That makes my idle timing about 10 degrees
ATDC.  The bus starts and runs fine once it is warmed up.  I know I
still need to do some fine tuning on the 34pict carb that I installed,
but that's not what you are asking about, so it's a story for another
day.
    I hope this helps
