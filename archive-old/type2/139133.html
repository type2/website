&gt; What kind of clamps are people using for 5mm carb fuel line?

I use the stainless ones, they are called ABA and are Swedish (yes really!).
They come in just about any metric size but I think the correct size is 13,
which translates to 11-13mm.  You will probably find that the next size up
fits as well.
