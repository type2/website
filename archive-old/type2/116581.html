Russ,

400 is nothing to worry about if you have the sender mounted on a spark
plug.  I have driven mine at over 550 and it didn't blow up or fail
catastrophically.  It did spit out a spark plug insert eventually so now I
have an excuse to replace the heads (I knew all along I was trashing
them--hopefully my pistons aren't too melted) and reset the compression to
something more healthy. . . 350 is in the middle because it is optimal. 400
is warm (we're talking combustion chambers here).  I remember hearing in
here that 450 is &quot;do not exceed&quot; temp for airplanes.  That would include a
safety margin but running constantly at that temp would seem to reduce
longevity.

It is normal to swing up to 100 degrees when you go up and down hills.  If
you're like me and run without a thermostat (flame suit on).
