Subject: Re: [T2] Rust protection device - So that's what this is: 'Auto
  Saver Systems'

For whatever reason, when I bought my 97 Odyssey in 2004,  this funky
little black box with a flashing LED was leaching onto my cars battery
cable nestled on my engine compartment.  The double stick tape had
long since unstuck, and a spring loaded eighth inch light metal rod
amidst it all befuddled me.  I failed in my google attemps so I
unplugged this &quot;Corrosion Control Device&quot; (which I figured might be
something to keep the battery happy) and threw it in a box.

Then this thread got me digging and I've found it in the tubes:

And even better, I know it must work, because I see JC Whitney also sells it..~

Off to see where the other box may be dangling...
..and the rust bubble on the rear emblem has grown slightly since I
bought the minivan.
