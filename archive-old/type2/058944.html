&gt;This isn't nerve gas we're talking about.  The whole

&gt;posed by a five-foot by five-inch sheet of the stuff is,
&gt;as far as I'm concerned, about the same as that posed
&gt;by an errant meteorite.  Wear a dust mask.  Be careful
&gt;cutting the straps which hold it on.  Put it in a
&gt;garbage bag, tie it up securely, take a shower, do your
&gt;laundry.

I don't even think that's necessary unless the tube that it wraps around is
rusting through.  The air flows through the tube and does not get near the
asbestos wrapper unless the tube is rusted through.  But I agree with Pat
otherwise - this asbestos scare is way over-hyped, like most things in life
these days.
