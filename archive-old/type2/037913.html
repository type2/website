Subject: Dash repair

Hi Volks,
   My bus has a problem that I know many of you have had to deal with.  The 
DPO cut the vinyl and foam of the dash to install a radio (and not even a 
good one).  Has anyone devised a good looking and effective repair???
   Knowing the creative minds that are part of this list, I'm certain that 
at least one of you have.  Now pleez share it with us all.
