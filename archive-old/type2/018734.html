Hey now,
Some of you may have seen my post regarding a potential renovation or
parts bus last week, I had a chance to really look at it today and was
overwhelmed.  It is a mess, the interior has little if any thing that is
really salvageable.  It does have 2 engines in it, and a whole lot of
parts.  The body is not that bad, some minor dents, but other than rust
that is in the dents it is really pretty much rust free.  The kid who
owns it is under the gun with the county, he has it on a small back road
just south of Carmel.  It has been tagged once now by the county to be
towed.  He wanted a couple of hundred bucks for it, but I think now he
would just give it to someone whom would either renovate it or part it
out, rather than have the county come take it.  

So it is yours I think, if you can arrange to get it ASAP.  Pmail for
the kids number and more info if you would like.
