Subject: nickgreely; problem with 72

hey all,
      i've just reinstalled my 1700 type IV, and to my dismay, there is a 
loud whoosh of air coming form the vicinity of cylinder 3.  i previously 
dropped a valve seat in that location.  i haven't done a compression test 
(don't have tester).  any advice will be welcomed with open arms.  
                                            N8 

           nick drop me  a line   (sprigz)
