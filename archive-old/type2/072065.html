Subject: Steering Wheel Puller

&gt; Does anyone know wherer I can order a steering wheel puller for a 71 Type
&gt;2 Camper? I have a couple but they dont look like the one in my manual.

i have heard that the puller shown in the bentley is an imposter. doesn't
exist. anywhere. that being said, i thought i was going to voilently thrash
my head in and out of the windshield during an attempt to remove mine from
my parts bus. after a trip to the type2 library and archives, i found folks
had the same misery. here's what i did to get mine off a 68er: back the nut
halfway off the steering wheel. for this use a 1 1/16th&quot; socket, or a 27mm.
this is so the wheel doesn't pop into your face during the happiest moment
of your day. drop some liquid wrench over the aluminum splines of the
column, and immediately - not a few minutes later -  with your feet already
up on the fresh air duct work beneath the dash, use your thighs and hands
to pop the wheel off. then remove the rest of the 27mm nut and take your
wheel off. the deal seems to be the steering wheel gets jammed well onto
the splines of the column so much so they almost seem inseparable. almost.
