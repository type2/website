Subject: CV's - Repeat after Me - &quot;Spend the money&quot; long

Well here it is, the whole unblemished story.  I knew my CV's were 
going to go relatively soon.  The second '80 Westi I bought had 
decent CV's so I figured I could refurb them and be happy.  WELL 
THINK AGAIN.  I limped home Wednesday on VERY noisy CV's and 
parked the bus up on the ramp with tail in the air.  Planned to spend 
the day home Halloween with 5 yr old Trick or Treating in downtown 
Grass Valley anyway, so wasn't out a day of work.  Great, I could get 
boot kits in town anyway.  

Spent the morning under the bus cleaning the bolts.  WD-40 was 
worthless.  Used a curved blade exacto knife and a dental scraping 
tool to clean out bolt openings.  Carb cleaner worked real well to clean 
and dry bolts.  Doing this on right side.  Bolts had hexes and were
relatively easy to remove, except as you would expect the LAST one.  

Messed around for awhile before realizing that of 12 bolts THAT one 
(top inboard) was a 12 point socket, not a hex.  Finally got it out.  
Cleaned up and went to town with Sara and, got the 2 kits ($16 ea 
with bolts).  Returned to tackle the right side CV's on the other bus.  
All hexes this time.  Cutting away torn boots on outboard CV's helped 
a lot to gain visual access for cleaning.  Jacked up other bus 7 inches 
and placed tires on nailed pile of 2x8's.  Nice with that much clearance.  Another break to take 
all kids TrickorTreating at the shopping centers.  Returned to dismantle 
other bus CV's to find that they were the original CV's for the '80 bus. 
 
Odometer quit at 100K in 1987.  Evidence of regreasing joints 
though (vice marks on shaft near CV both ends).  CV's worn badly.  
Bummer.  Decided on cheap short term fix, so proceeded to clean and 
stare at joints to realize that I couldn't flip axle over to extend 
life.  Bummer again.  Had already cleaned and pained axle BTW.  
Getting to be about 9:00PM.  Continued to clean joints.  Reassembled 
and greased joints.  NOTE: seemed easier to grease with joint already 
installed on axle.  BTW the bearings can be installed with inner 
housing installed on axle, or in my case disassembled all by itself 
after being greased!  Bummer, installing individual balls covered in 
grease.  Cleaned up self and went to see SO and had her repeat the 
following mantra: &quot;Spend the money, spend the money&quot;.  

To see if she really COULD say the words.  She did.  $32 for boot kits 
versus $92 for a whole axle with new CV's and lifetime warranty, spend 
the money.  Went back out and proceeded to install axle as intended 
short term fix (even though badly worn to be more worn). Installed 
outboard 12 point bolts and started to torque first one.  SHATTER.
There went my one and only 12 point 8mm tool.  Clean up go inside
and go to bed, 11:00.

Woke up and took 20 minutes for backup vehicle (Ford Crewcab) to 
start.  After another 20 minutes realized that tail and dash lights 
weren't working and fiddling with wiring only caused heater motor to 
stop.  Gave up and went back to bed.  Waited til daylight and drove 
to work.  FLAPS that had axle for $99 6 weeks ago price was $158.
Get to work, call around, other FLAPS that had axle for $99 was out 
and not available for 4-5 days, BUT for $91.

I'll go flop Left axle to right, install refurbed onto left and wait 
for parts, sigh.  Think I'll buy both axles and keep refurb as spare.
Basically spent $32 for 12 bolts and temporary use of one axle and 
learned about my vehicles workings.  But, next time &quot;Spend the money&quot;

After spending lots of time cleaning out bolts, here's a thought.  
Apply a little silicone lube to interior of bolts heads, after 
torqueing the second time after a few days, apply a little silicone 
sealant to the top of the head.  When dry it should be easy to pry 
out, at least easier that dirt/oil mix.  Silcone lube should keep 
sealant from sticking to bolt.  Any thoughts?
