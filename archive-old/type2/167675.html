&gt;    It doesn't count if the engine just sits in the Bus fer 100,000 miles;
&gt;    it's gotta be installed and runnin'... ;-)

I had a GEX for 3,400 miles when it &quot;stopped&quot; then got a &quot;real&quot;
rebuild but the case and crank were reused, new piston, cyl etc etce.
and it did push the bus to Everybus this year, but not all the way
home, but that was a head issue)
