Subject: RE: [T2] Clutch ... (I Love you all ..)

How did it go ? Very Very easily .. Jacked the bus up took off the pan from
the front .. Clutch cable looked new all in order but it seems loose ..

Went to the back .. Armed with Mole (Vise) grips, turned six turns .. No
mole grips reqd ..

Dropped it down .. drives like new ... all problems have dissapeared ..

It's possible that the nut has &quot;self adjusted&quot; itself out .. what do the
assembled think of loctite ?   I don't like the idea myself .. a little bit
of rust would make it a little stiffer ..   Humm ..

This is why I love internet forums .. the advice I had from you all could
not have been had from a manual .. Not only did it give me the confidence to
do the job but it mean't I could do it really quickly ...
