Subject: Re: Awful knocking noise from rear axle .... Help appreciated

Hey Nicholas,
I believe it's your CV joints.  Go look under the car at the rear axle
and see if the rubber boot is broken.  Chances are that it's broken, and
dust and other various things have entered the joint messing it up.

anyone else have any thoughts on this one?

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I can hear a pretty bad knocking noise from the rear left ( if looking
&gt; from behind) of my 72 bay.  It seems to be coming from either the
&gt; wheel or the rear wheel shaft but I'm not sure as it only happens
&gt; when driving along.  One thing which might help in diagnosis is that
&gt; the noise seems dependant on whether I have my foot on the
&gt; accelerator or not.  If I'm accelerating then the noise seems to
&gt; retreat and if I take my foot off the accelerator the noise seems to
&gt; come back.  knock knock knock... It also seems to be slightly
&gt; worse when cornering.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have any ideas as to what this could be ???
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt;
