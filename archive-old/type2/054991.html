&gt; and greasing, thus utilizing my God given gift of
&gt; screwing myself over.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a type of clamp I can get that can be installed
&gt; post facto? Can I use a heavy duty cable tie?

I've used narrow hose clamps with good results.  You might have to get two
to use together to get the length you need.  The aftermarket clamps for
dual-port manifold seals work well.  Tighten them snugly, not tight!
