Subject: Re: [T2] 76 brake problems...

thanks.... i have checked fluid and its fine......
   
  the brke pedal goes all the way to the floor...?
   
  i have looked at both back metal lines and i cant see any fluid leaking out when i push the brake pedal three or four times slowly so not to rupture the master cylinder....
   
  could possibly the new brake hoses have a block in them at the old metal lines..?
   or could one of the metal lines have a hole and still not leak alot of fluid...? or any?
   
  thanks i have two calls in now on answering machines for new metal lines or used at this point.... this is one of those things i should have replaced at the time of rubber hoses but post poned it for a later break down i guess....

Check fluid level in your reservoir. Then have someone pump the brakes
repeatedly while you crawl around underneath looking for leaks.

I can't say I've ever had a hard line break on any car. Not
impossible, of course. But for me it's always been the soft hoses from
the hard lines to the wheels.
