&gt;Also, I have the J.C. Whitney one piece muffler on the van. I has some
&gt;rust on the tailpipe, and is louder than stock, but it was the right
&gt;price. Next time we drop the engine, I'll try to paint it with BBQ/Stove
&gt;hi-temp paint.

That stuff will burn off within a few minutes and stink while it does it.

BUT. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF.

A person got a new muffler (like, cheap, a muffler made in a Third World
country like Brazil or Denmark) (or maybe German for that matter) and
covered the entire thing with JB Weld with a roller. Could you roll it like
paint? Could you thin it with lacquer thinner or something? Would this
maybe work?

Those waterboxer people use the stuff to fill pits inside their actual
combustion chambers, and if it can stand up to that it seems like it could
hold up on a muffler. Am I nuts? Mine is less than a year old and it has
little holes in it and this is the South, for Pete's sake.
