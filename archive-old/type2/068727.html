&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Well, I've been having a discussion with Bob Hoover, Craig Standley, and
&gt; Paul Wies about the heater blower, all prompted by Emily Jo Hanlon's
&gt; innocent question.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, Craig and Bob contend that the alternator must be charging
&gt; before the heater blower will operate.  Bob pointed out to me that there
&gt; is a relay the controls this function.
&gt; 

I side with Bob the '77 and '78 both have the relay and both charge only 
with the alternator charging, as far as I've ever bothered to tell IE
the fan does not run with merely the ignition on, car must be running.
