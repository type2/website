Subject: RE: [T2] OUCH $150 for a mechanical fuel pump, how about 
  electric?!?!?!?!?

&gt; I'm done---
&gt;
&gt; Stock is best--and in the long run it doesn't cost one dime more to go
&gt; first class--and I do know that I won't be having any more down time.
&gt;
&gt; The only reason the late model stuff is running electric pumps is the
&gt; pressures the injection needs to pop off the injectors--
&gt;
&gt; This ain't necessary with a carbed vehicle--
&gt;

Stock works fine. It is best for you Terry. That doesnt mean it is besr
for every situation for every person.
