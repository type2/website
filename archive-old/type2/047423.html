&gt;I am not sure it is the cold start. Another thing the shop forgot to do was
&gt;reconnect the cold start, but the bus started any way with me pumping some
&gt;gas into it via the gas pedal.


&lt;snip&gt;

I fthis bus is injection - you can't &quot;ump&quot; gas into it with the pedal as 
the pedal is just connected to the butterfly valve in the throttle body.

I guess pumping might bounce the flapper in the airbox.

Anybody?

A squirt of ether worked for me..
