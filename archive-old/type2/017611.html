&gt;Shortly after buying a new battery, I jump in the van to go to work. No

&gt;ignition lights. I go round the back and find the engine bay open and
my new
&gt;battery has been CUT OUT. the police were actually interested and would
have
&gt;taken fingerprints if I could drive the van up to the police station
and
&gt;please try not to touch anything.
&gt;I now have a padlock through the engine bay button - it looks like it's

&gt;wearing a nose-ring. Authenticity is never worth that grief again.

I like that. It would make a great motto: &quot;Authenticity is never worth
that grief again&quot;

It is not just VW bus owners that have that problem. Those that own
Dodge Dart and Plymouth Valiants suffer from starting problems due to
missing batteries too.
But please consider a hood lock. I have one on my '71 and don't lose
batteries anymore. Someone has the locks, Rocky Mountain or somebody
stocks hood locks for VW busses.

Re: Tires. After much searching, I bought Yokohama Y356 185-14 C rated
radials for ~$50 each from Tirerack. They stock them, but the Y356 is
not listed on their web page. You actually have to call (shudder!) and
ask. They knew right away what I was putting them on (who ELSE would
want 185-14's?) and the tires were delivered to my door the next
morning.
