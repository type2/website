Subject: RE: [T2] What year is my bus?

Or compare engine compartment air inlets and bumpers.  Larger, squared off air inlets (1972 - 1979) and rounded bumpers (1968 - 1972). So, as you can see, 1972 is the only year with this combination.

&gt; &gt; Did the 72 bus have the access hatch to the engine, the one inside &gt; the bus 
&gt; that is over the engine? 
&gt; 
&gt; Someone could have put in the panel. 
&gt; 
&gt; Are your front turns closer to your front bumper or winshield. If bumper then 
&gt; its a 72, if not then I would say something's odd, maybe a VIN switch or nose 
&gt; and hatch panel replacement. 
&gt; 
&gt; Low front turns plus square tails = 72 bus.
