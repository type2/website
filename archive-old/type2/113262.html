Subject: Friday Content: Type 2 Religious Family Tree

I thought it would be fun to make a 'Family Tree' of religious issues
surrounding the Type 2. Here's what I can come up with:

1. Original vs. Modified

&quot;VWAG engineers were close to God and should be second guess&quot; vs. &quot;whatever it
takes to keep it on the road.&quot;

2. Splitty vs. Bay vs. Vanagon

Each of these have their subfamilies. Bays break down into uprights and
pancakes. All split up into transporters, westies, cabs, etc. Vanagons come in
air-cooled vs. wasser-boxes.

3. Oil

Dino vs. Synthetic, weights, frequency of changes.

4. Tires

Big, small, etc., etc.

5. Spark plugs

6. Engine only vs. Engine and Transmission when removing the engine

7. Paint

Strip to the bare metal or house paint and brushes

Anything else I'm missing?

-Eric

P.S. Hope to see you at FMIJ. Heidi and I will be pulling in sometime Saturday
evening. Save us a spot!
