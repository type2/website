&gt; hi all, i am taking a trip next week in my westy and wonder about one of my
&gt; tires that has a plug in it.  what's the deal with plugged tires? can they
&gt; be used hard, what kind of life expectancy does a tire have with a plug?  -

depends is it a plug/patch from the inside?? or just an external
plug.  plugs do not work on steel belted tires at all and should not be
used at speed, or on radials

YMMV
