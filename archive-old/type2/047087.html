Subject: Re: [T2] What is a 74 bus worth?

My 74 Westy just had a bad engine.  $500.00.  Northern California.  I've got to
ask, What is &quot;the usual rust&quot; many of you folks mention?  :&gt;)

&gt; I found a 74 bus, original paint (faded), cracked windshield, doesn't run in

&gt;
&gt; What is it worth?
