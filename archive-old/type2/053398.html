It is a friction fit. The tube has barbs on it and is wrapped with teflon
tape. Pull straight up. I have been 'seen' with 2 framing hammers, the claws
180 apart, gently and evenly lifting the tube up. Be sure to put cardboard
or thick rags under the hammer heads to protect the wood. Try not to break
the plastic lip....

&gt; '79 Westy
&gt; How does one remove the plastic fill spout from the water tank? I have
tried
&gt; unscrewing it, and it rotates, but does not back out. Is this spout
threaded
&gt; into the tank, or a press fit? I think my tank may have a crack in it, so
I
&gt; am trying to remove it for inspection.
