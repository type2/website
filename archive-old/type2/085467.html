Subject: Re: [T2] Manual trans fluid

jamie rivers sends:

&gt; i did some research, and come up with a fluid I was told is OK for the Vw
&gt; trans even though it has a GL-5 rating,,,
&gt; 80w-90 Chevron Delo Gear Lubricant ESI  API service GL-4 / GL-5 / MT-1
&gt; I thought I'd pass it on to see if anyone has comments ??

Who told you that? If this isn't synthetic gear lube and it has a GL-5
rating, it contains the synchro-eating additives.
