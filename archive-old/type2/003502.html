You have to weld in tabs at the back end of the assembly to make the roof lift
up when fully closed.  You'll probably need to look at a sunroof bus to get
the right shape.  You also need to install drain tubes.  If you don't the rain
will leak into you bus, more like rain in your bus, causing rusting from the
inside out.

PS Any one looking for sunroof cables I have a set for sale.  Make offer.  I
am in South Carolina but will ship.

&gt; I have a '68 Westy and have often thought the opening looked like the
&gt; sunroof hole.  So, what would be involved in going the other direction?
&gt; Anyone in CA want to swap their working sunroof for a pop top?  The tent is
&gt; decent but the rear-screen zipper is bad (I have been putting off the new
&gt; canvas purchase), and I have both the long pass side cot and a '74 long
&gt; driver side cot.
