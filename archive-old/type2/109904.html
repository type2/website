&lt;&lt; Has anyone modified their front passenger chair to swivel around?  Sure 

would be nice if it could face the rear compartment - I've thought about 

using heavy-duty lazy susan hardware with 1/2 inch safety bolts (when in 

the forward-facing position) - wondering if anyone else has tried it.

I wouldn't and your insurance company doesn't want you to either...In
case of an accident, (even a minor one) do you really want someone
you care about to be dependant on a DIY modification ?-(  
And seat belt mounts...What about those...?
