Sounds like a Gregs VW/KD Motorsports Show, Vallejo maybe?

&gt; Mike,
&gt; you reminded me of a vw show i went to when i lived in CA, the big
&gt; event was 
&gt; the Engine Blow Raffle, where they put an upright motor in a metal
&gt; cage, 
&gt; drained the oil, ran a fuel line over to a gas can, and took bets on
&gt; how 
&gt; long it would run. my wife and i stood there, interested in the event,
&gt; i had 
&gt; guessed about 12 minutes, and the thing went to about 18, then bang,
&gt; wobble, 
&gt; wobble, clunk, clunk, thunk. I remember saying to my wife &quot;oh wait,
&gt; i have 
&gt; heard that happen before...&quot;
&gt; (fond memories of the 71 sunroof bus).. please don't let it happen
&gt; to the 77 
&gt; anytime soon...

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;78 is the first loaf with hydraulic lifters and the last year with
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;common exhaust parts.  If I am correct, the 79 has a one-year exhaust
&gt; &gt;setup.  So, it's the last loaf worth getting before they switched
&gt; body
&gt; &gt;styles and exhaust parts.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I just got a 78 deluxe... got it in green, too :)  It's pretty nice..
&gt; &gt;except for the fact that I blew out the engine.. but then again, what
&gt; vw
&gt; &gt;owner hasn't.. and.. what vw bus owner doesn't have 2 backup engines
&gt; ..
&gt; &gt;hahaha
