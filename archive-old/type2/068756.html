Subject: Heater Blowers

Ugh! Huh? I am confused. After reading all the posts.. I am spinning.
I noticed my heater motor does not function without the motor running.

With the motor running if the lever is in the down position the fan will
operate.
If I move the lever up the fan stops operating.

With the engine off the fan doesn't operate regardless of lever position.

Is something wrong here? Do I need to fix some wiring?

I have a '73 campmobile did heater blower operation change in later years?
