&gt;Good day!
&gt;Thanks for the heating tips for the pistons pin!!! (I had forgot about 
&gt;this one), they went out like knife in butter.
&gt;
&gt;Diagnostic:
&gt;-All pistons removed, no scratch on side wall what so ever (pistons and 
&gt;cylinders)
&gt;-Some slight carbon deposit between top of pistons and first compression 
&gt;ring (side).

Reduce oil change interval to prevent this. Also, valve to guide clearance 
should be in spec.

&gt;-Carbon deposit removed from top of pistons (90.82mm).

As above, and keep ignition and mixture in spec.

&gt;-Camshaft is beautiful, no pitting on the lobe, nice color.

That's a good sign.

&gt;-Not able/equipped to check the total wear between pistons and cylinders

All it takes is a feeler gauges?? Remove the rings. Clean pistons and 
cylinders. install the piston with the top just under the ring at the top 
of the cylinder. Push some feeler gauges in there a see what you got. Also 
check the skirts at this position. What's the spec?? .003?? Look it up. Or 
bore gauges for the cylinders compared to micrometer measures of the pistons.

&gt;I don't believe in head rebuilt (VW) but I don't have any choice, no new 
&gt;1.7 heads available.

NW Con Rod, Seattle. I know they know how to properly replace the guides 
and seats if required. They also might be able to provide aftermarket NEW 
castings. Regardless, Jerry will know all viable options and can advise and 
provide.

&gt;The problems: in my motorcycle engine experience, new rebuild (fly cut) 
&gt;head(s) = high compression = rings failure. For sure motorcycle rev at 
&gt;12000rpm. I could lower the compression ratio???

Shims are available to reset correct compression. They go between the 
bottom of the cylinders and the case. Always standard procedure to check 
deck height and make this adjustment.

&gt;(compression was 122psi at #1, 0psi all others)

Actual measures and inspection can confirm good rings/pistons/cylinders. 
Put each ring by itself in it's cylinder and hold it up to the light. If 
you can see light between the ring and cylinder, you aren't spec no matter 
how you measure it. Requires only ring removal tool and source of light to 
verify.

Pouring gas in the inverted heads will reveal any leaks in the valves. Gas 
in any port verifies no seal. A few tablespoons of gas is all that is 
needed for this verification.
