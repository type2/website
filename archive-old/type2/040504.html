Subject: Corvair engine installation

hi, I was wondering if anyone out there has ever installed a chevy
corvair engine in thier bus.  I would love to have one in mine and have
heard nothing but good things about this type of installation.  If
anyone can lead me to a good webpage or person to talk to i would be
very grateful.  Thank you
