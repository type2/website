Subject: Re: [T2] Teflon Tape on Brake Bleed Valve Threads?


Kevin,

I've used it before.  I don't think *anything* eats teflon...

Some people are opposedto it, but I can't remember why now.
Maybe they will chime in with their reservations.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; List,
&gt; 
&gt; Subject says it all.  I'm trying to bleed my brakes with a hand vacuum pump 
&gt; and I've notice that when the bleed nipple is opened there is a little play 
&gt; in the threads that allows outside air to short circuit the vacuum.  A thin 
&gt; layer of teflon tape around the nipple threads would appear to stop this 
&gt; problem but I'm not sure if the tape and brake fluid are compatible.  My 
&gt; guess is it's okay but I'd some other opinions first.
&gt; 
&gt; Much Thanks
