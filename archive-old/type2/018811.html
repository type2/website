To All:
  After a year and a half of reading posts, I've yet to hear this one.
The other day, as I was about to pull out into the street, I heard the
loud *bang*.  Not knowing what it was, I cut the engine, pushed her back
out of the road, and crawled underneath.  Well, what happened?  Four of
the bolts holding my CV joint in had worked their merry way out and the
remaining two were sheered off.  I'm off to replace the bolts tomorrow
and hope no further damage was done.

I tightened the afforementioned bolts less than four months ago.  I
guess I'll have to make check the allen bolts part of my regular
maintenance schedule.  Are there any tricks for keeping the bolts from
loosening?  Loc-tite?  JB Weld?  I'm curious what others do.

If you haven't checked yours, you might want to.  I just glad I wasn't
cruising down the interstate when this happened.  Another question, how
can you determine/change which wheel the transaxle delivers power to?

Have a great weekend!!!
