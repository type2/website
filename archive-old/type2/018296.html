Right, Rosemary

I've also had very good luck at Interstate VW. Jim really knows his VW's
and his parts. Last year I realized that I needed the special front
(FIF) tin that closed the arch in my '71 Crew-Cab. I was using the bug
front tin, and was letting in a considerable amount of heated air. Jim
showed me the huge pile of tinware, and said that it would be in there,
and I could look til I found one. I looked and looked, because there
were many, many bug tins. After awhile, Sean came over and helped me
look, then Jim started looking with us. Finally, we found one. And the
price wasn't bad, either. Don't get me wrong, his prices can be high at
times, but I feel it's worth it in the long run, because they usually
have what I need. And I don't have to try several junk yards.
