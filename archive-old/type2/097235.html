Subject: Re: [T2] New dude on the block

&gt; anxious to sell and had reserve in the area of $5000.  (I don't want to
tell
&gt; the reserve in case he re-lists it).  He is realizing it may not bring
that
&gt; much.  I wasn't sure if it was a Delivery or Campmobile (like I said, I'm
&gt; clueless on Vdubs) but NADA puts low retail at $3600 for the Delivery and
&gt; $6175 for low retail on the Campmobile.  How much should I offer?  &gt;

Well heres my .05 worth, many on the list will tell you that you'll end up
at $5K eventually. Couple of things jump out at me, the dividers behind the
seat have been cut out for non-stock seats, it wasn't a westy to start as
you can seen the fresh-air ducts on the door, a Riviera at one time maybe?
Why was the engine rebuilt after only 50K mi's. Myself, I think being in
SoCal there are enough dry buses that the 5K number is a little high. For
5K, I'd want a really nice full westy with good canvas, full camp kit and
original paint. But hey, YMMV and some of us are cheaper than others. As a
mech there's nothing really difficult about VW's just do it by the numbers
and use good parts and tools. Welcome aboard.
