Subject: Re: [T2] Breakdown - Resolution

I think I got it backwards.  The water is lighter than Kerosene  and heavier than gasoline. Kerosene pushes it to the top, drain it,  then the gasoline will push what's left back to the bottom.  Then  pump it through the fuel line until it's gone.  
  
  Or then maybe I got it right the first time.  My memory ain't what it used to be.  Cheers...KR

Don't know if the bus has a  drain on the bottom, how easy it is to get to, etc. But what I did was  completely drain the tank and flush it with a water hose really good.  Then I filled it about half full of Kerosene and stuck an air hose down  in it to really slosh it up good. Drained the Kerosene and filled it  with Gasoline. Water is heavier than Kerosene and it pushes it to the  bottom. It is lighter than Gasoline. So, pump some out through the fuel  line into a glass container until you don't see any more water floating  to the top. Since I didn't fill the tank with Kerosene I didn't  completely solve the problem. But I go much longer between having to  change fuel filters. Maybe once every couple of months as opposed to  days. If you can afford it, fill it up with Kerosene. I saved mine last  time and may buy
 enough more to fill it up and do it 
 again.  
  
  On the other hand, when my bus needed this a few years ago, I paid my  local VW guy to do pull it and have it boiled out and treated. $250 and  no other problems. Cheers...KR
