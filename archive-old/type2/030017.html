Mike,

260 is too hot!  I used to pull over or slow down at 250 on my MSHP super
engine (which wasn't). On the stock 2L now installed in my '80 westy I
have not been able to push it over 230, even in the summer.  We shall see
what temps I see going over the Rockies this June, but here in VA (no real
mountains), I tend to run 180 in the winter, 210 in the summer.  If I
could pick a temp to run at it would be 210-220. I would say that below
190 is too cool, 210-220 is ideal, and 250 is the top end of acceptable
without damage to your oil (and engine shortly thereafter)
