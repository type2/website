we have a vw shop in kentucky and have
been doing business with bus boys for
more years than most bus owners
have been driving. on a scale of 1 to 10
we would have to give them at the very
least a 10. we have had a problem with
them. sometimes it helps if someone
with a problem takes a good look in
the mirror of life, they might find that
part of the problem started at home.

&quot;everyone is right in their own mind&quot;

happy trails
