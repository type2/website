Subject: Re: [T2] POR 15 vs Eastwood Rust Encapsulator 

Hi,

A product comparison in the latest issue of Auto Restorer gave the nod to 
Eastwood Rust Encapsulator over POR-15.

POR-15 cost more, was more difficult to appy, and didn't hold up as well.

Chuck


&gt;So am I picking up the idea the POR 15 products are not good?
&gt;
&gt;Is their rust prevention stuff ok?
&gt;
&gt;What's the general consensus? I've seen 1 negative about
&gt;their paint products.
