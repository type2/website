Hi Volks,

Last weekend I visited Erik Meltzers lot (IG-T2) in Germany. They held their
Jahrestreffen in the Harz (about 100 km from Wolfsburg). The weekend was
very well organised, the only thing they had no control over was the weather
(it rained cats and dogs for most of the weekend). On saturday we visited
the VW-bus museum. Actually during this visit there were more busses outside
the museum than inside.

I put a trip report on my website. The report is in Dutch but the pictures
speak for themselfes. Go have a look
(http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/vwbusclub/T2-goslar.htm)

Talking about my website .... I put a lot of work into it. Sadly the number
of visitors is not quite as high as I expected. It seems that the only way
to attract a lot of traffic is to include dirty pictures. So in order to
increase the number of visitors and keeping in mind that most subscribers to
this list are men I have included some.

Interested ? Goto http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus.htm and click on &quot;Dirty
Pictures&quot;.
