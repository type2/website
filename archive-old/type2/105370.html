Subject: More F.I. questions and pictures. Any ideas? Thanks for the
  help!!!!

Hello List,

Thank you to everyone who emailed me back regard the
fuel pump placement. Of course, I came up with a few
other questions, mainly about &quot;extra&quot; wires on my F.I.
wiring harness. The first three pictures are of these
extra F.I. wires.

 The first is a black wire coming from the double
relay. There are 2 of these black wires coming from
the relay that stay inside the engine compartment and
I know that one goes to the coil but I was unable to
trace where the other one went. Any Ideas? 

The next picture shows 2 &quot;white&quot; wires coming from the
ECU plug. I found no where to connect these. I was
thinking that they were for a Throttle position sensor
but this F.I didn't have that (79 federal Bus F.I. by
the way)

The Next picture is of 2 black wires that are coming
from the part of the F.I. wiring harness that goes
through the fire wall towards the front of the bus.
These are not the fuel pump wires. Where do they go?

The last 2 pics shows 2 plugs that I found dangling
from the ceiling of the engine compartment when I
bought the bus. Are these part of the diagnostic
system that VW installed? 

Last question (for now), The 2 outlet at the bottom of
the fuel tank, Is the fuel pump and filter  connected
to the inlet that is pointing to the front of the bus
or the rear of the bus? I just want to get it right
before I fill up the gas tank.

Thanks again for your help! I will get this beast
running soon Because of you!

Have a great day!

Regards,

David Kelly
