&gt; &gt; I've got a 79' 2.0L Westy which needs a new clutch. I'm in the process of
&gt; &gt; dropping the engine now. My question is, are there some screws  underneath
&gt; &gt; the bus that hold the front engine tin (that goes from one side to the
&gt; &gt; other) to the motor?

Yes, there are.  Specifically there are two that you have to access from 
outside which hold the bracket for the flapper box.  As someone else 
mentioned already, you should just drop that piece of tin with the engine 
as you will bend it up trying to get it out otherwise (been there, done that!).
