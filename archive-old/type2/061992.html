How about the way these machines mess with your mind. My problem had nothing
to do with the ignition switch, radio or anything else relatated. Instead it
was the hose from the aux. air regultor that had popped off leaving the
system wide open. I guess it vibrated off but in any event that was the
problem and easy fix. 

Thanks,
