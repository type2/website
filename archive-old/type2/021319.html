&lt;&lt;The low CR and high altitude make for a really lousy engine.....Bump
to 8:1+
and be fine..&gt;&gt;

Would we have a lot of trouble with gas at low altitudes with the higher
CR? I know the magic number used to be 9:1 or was it 9.5:1. But all the
changes in gas over the years, I don't know what a safe CR is anymore.
