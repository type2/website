Subject: Re: [T2] Buying rebuilt engine

If you buy a long block then the push rods should already be installed but

&gt;you should buy an engine gasket set anyway.  You will not need all of them
&gt;but you will need enough of them to make it worthwhile (intake gaskets,
&gt;oil filler gasket, etc.).  You should also take this opportunity to
&gt;replace as much of the rubber on your engine as possible.  If you are
&gt;running fuel injection then this is the time to replace the hoses
&gt;connecting your intake runners to the intake manifold.  Replace vacuum
&gt;lines.  And...
&gt;
&gt;REPLACE ALL FUEL LINES!!!!!!
&gt;  
&gt;

Do you recall; if the push rod tubes are installed on the long block, is 
the tin that is between the p.r. tubes and the cylinders installed also? 
I don't have room to have two engines sitting around for long and would 
like to have every thing ready for reassemble when the rebuilt engine 
arrives.

As I remember from rebuilding the engine in my 75 myself, the injector 
seals and intake runner hoses didn't come with the gasket set. are there 
any other gaskets or hoses that anyone knows of that need to be ordered 
separately? The FLAPS around here don't know what air cooled means!

Thanks
Tom
