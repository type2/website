Subject: Leaking Oil

My 76 is leaking a lot of oil.  The valve cover gasket is an obvious fix.  I
pulled the tin that attaches to the heater boxes and the push rod tubes are
leaking too.
I was just wondering, are there any other likely candidates that can be dealt
with with the engine in?  Looks like more is leaking up front.
Thanks,
Mike
