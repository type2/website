Subject: Seattle Rebuilders

Hey all-

There is a reputable shop south of downtown Seattle that does good work
and for a decent price.  Northwest Connecting Rod.  They did a rebuild
on a friend's 1600dp and it was clean and sweet.  Another buddy is going
to take the motor from his beloved custom camper bus (and home) to them
for a rebuild.  I, so far, have not needed their services.  But, as far
as I have heard, they are a good outfit.
