Subject: Re: [T2] weber identification

&gt;I need to identify the set of dual weber carbs which are installed on a 
&gt;friends bus, and i'm having problems doing so.
&gt;
&gt;Specifically, i need a rebuild kit or two because while checking the float 
&gt;level on one of the carbs, the top gasket (which was hard as a rock) ripped.
&gt;
&gt;Any idea on steps to correctly identify these so I can pick up a rebuild 
&gt;kit and perhaps tune them?  (now that a friend just bought a carb-sync tool)

If a gasket falls to bits for inspection, it has been too long since they 
have been properly serviced. Do plan to tear them down and do a thorough 
cleaning and reassemble and adjustment.

Check with any flaps that has the Haynes manual for Weber carbs. Bigger 
public libraries might have one or certainly with any inter-library loan. 
Just flip through there till you see the chapter with diagrams that look 
like yours. If you pull the carb and clean it expect to find markings on 
the bottom mounting flange edge in most cases but certainly somewhere on 
there. Beware that most FLAPS will have a $10 kit they sells for $20 that 
is a very poor substitute for a genuine Weber kit. What you get with the 
OEM real Italian kits from Weber is gaskets which fit perfectly and of the 
correct thickness, soft metal sealing washers that fit and crush properly, 
seals and o rings that are neither too thin or too thick or too large or 
too small and no seams with hang tags that cannot be made to seal. No 
ruined needles and seats because you can't feel them seat without damage, 
and on and on and on.

Three times the money for the real deal Weber OEM parts will save a lot of 
bucks fussing with poor function from wanabee generic no name kits. Also a 
fraction of the cost of ruined carbs if you go for the &quot;cheapest&quot;.
