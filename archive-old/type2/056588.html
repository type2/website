Subject: Need help with rubber seals, '71 front cables and so forth

I've been redoing my brakes on '71 bus that was parked in Seattle
mountain rain for 3 years...  Windshield seal was bad and a lot of rain
went in too.

Been leaking brake fluid, thought it was the MC -- but work underneath
today reveals that I think it was actually the brake fluid reservoir.
All the rubber is mush, tears apart (putrid).  Seems all fluid was out
when it was parked, so all rubber cracked and dried and fluid just
ruined it all.

I also found that the 1 or so bottles that I've let run all down the
pipe have ruined a number of other rubber bits -- not all related to
brake lines.

I need to make a list of what to order from Bus Depot or local FLAPS.  I
need some help figuring out what little rubber bits I need:

  1) There is a rubber bit that hooks the brake fluid reservoir to the
tube that runs to MC.  Anyone help with a part number?  Any availability
issues?
  2) I believe the e-brake cables each had a rubber stopper prior to
metal tube, right below (underneath bus) the driver seat area.  In
general -- is there a common &quot;rubber grommet&quot; that you put on cables as
they enter into tubes?  There seems to be a number (3+) that are all due
for replacement.
  3) The rubber boots to cover the brake (electrical) wire that goes to
the MC to dash light.
  4) Rubber that covers the hole that the accelerator cable goes from
cab to underneath -- this is a large hole for a small cable &lt;grin&gt;!

I've already got replacement rubber hoses for my brake lines.  Talk
about needing replacement!  Brakes bleed a LOT BETTER (and work &lt;grin&gt;)
when the line isn't clogged.

In general, all the rubber that you find around the front of the bus.
Does someone sell a &quot;complete kit&quot; of all these bits?  Almost 30 years
old, time to replace all this underneath rubber.

Thanks.
