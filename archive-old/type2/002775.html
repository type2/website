Alan:

I've used this technique before with good success.  If you can easily
get at the bolt (i.e., it's on a transmission-side flange) then I'd
give it a try.  Get a fairly small (maybe around 5&quot;-6&quot;) cold chisel,
and a regular hammer.  Start your tapping straight into the side of
the bolt head until the chisel's got a good &quot;bite&quot; then, still
tapping, rotate your chisel until the force of the blows transmitted
through the chisel will make the head want to rotate in a
counter-clockwise direction.  You don't beat the s**t out of it,
fairly steady solid tapping will usually do the job.

&gt; It was recommended to me by a mechanic that I should use a cold
&gt; chisel and a mallet to get the stripped bolt to turn.
&gt;
&gt; He said knock a notch in it, use that notch to force it with the
&gt; chisel and &quot;It will turn&quot;.
