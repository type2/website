Subject: Help with smoky heater

Hey folks...

Those of you who have been following along know the story of how a 
leaky oil cooler blew oil all over the place on my '76 Westy's engine 
(both the old and new).

As an unfortunate side-effect, the residue is causing oil smoke to come 
out of my heater / defroster vents once the engine gets warm.  Now that 
I have a non-leaky engine, it is not nearly as bad, but it is still 
there, and it drives both me and my wife nuts (my wife especially).  I 
know winters in San Francisco are mild compared to most places, but 
we've had a few pretty cold days lately, and combined with the fog... 
well, I want to use the heater! :-)

When the first rebuilt engine went in a few months ago, the shop 
cleaned the shroud, tin, and did the heat exchangers in the solvent 
tank and with a pressure washer (the exchangers were pretty well gunked 
up, apparently).

I'm not sure how much cleaning they did when the second rebuilt engine 
went in last week, but all the visible surfaces were clean, certainly.

The new engine is not leaking, and is not generating any smoke that can 
be smelled by sticking one's head inside the engine compartment or nose 
in the vent ears.

My question: Has anyone else had problems with a smoky heater, and how 
did you solve it?  Am I going to have to pull the shroud and exchangers 
off to deal with this, or will a little time eventually burn off this 
residue?

Thanks!
