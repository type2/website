Subject: Re: Back to the Trans Oil.

Also, i wanted to know if anybody had any suggestions or
&gt; tricks on filling it back up? As i remember, it was about impossible to
get
&gt; in there with the bottle, and i tried a few methods which were all rather
&gt; messy.
Sometimes it just pays in the long run to have the right tool.  I got a
suction gun from JCW for about $7.  Great for putting in or removing liquids
from tight spots.  Makes the tranny oil fill a piece of cake.  But, if you
like hot sauce......
