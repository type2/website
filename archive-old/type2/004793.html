Subject: Pulling and replacing pilot bearing in crankshaft

Volks,
Just got overcharged to replace the pilot bearing in the end of my crank at
the machine shop.

I think that if I could get the old one out, I could get the new one in, for
I have various bearing seating tools.

Any ideas how to easily remove the old one?
