Subject: Oil pressure sender

Hey everyone, I am about ready to order an oil pressure gauge and sender for my 
72 in the event I actually get it on the road again :-). Both the CIP1 and Bus 
Depot catalogs carry an extension said to ease installation. BD says it applies 
to 73 and up, CIP1 says it's for all type IV's. What do you all say, will I 
absolutely need one or not?
thanks
