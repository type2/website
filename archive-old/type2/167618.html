&gt; Sorry, should have mentioned that the wire that runs up to

&gt; I have a 78 westy and I am trying to identify a wire
&gt; coming from the alternator.
&gt;
&gt; There is a bundle of 4 wires that heads to the voltage
&gt; regulator. Three of the wires go to the regulator, but one
&gt; of them is loose with a connector on the end. Does anyone
&gt; know what this wire is for? I thought it was for the aux
&gt; battery relay, but it doesn't seem correct because it
&gt; always has +12v, even when the car is not on.

just went out and looked at my 78 and I only have 4 wires total. 3 go to
the voltage regulator and one is hooked to the wiring harness, I assume to
the front indicator..
