Subject: re: [T2] Any thoughts? my engine is running rough

David Kelly &lt;volknstein_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt; asked

I have been having trouble getting the vacuum up in my
bus. My bus has a 2L f.i. engine. I only have 7in of
vacuum at idle. The engine runs but it runs roughly.


David, when you have a vacuum gauge attached to the engine, if the needle
is rock steady, and high, then it is a good engine
If the needle is low and steady, it is just worn rings

If the needle is low and irratic, pulsing up and down, then you have  bad
valve[s] and worn rings

Can you describe the action of the gauge? Is it steady? or irratic?
