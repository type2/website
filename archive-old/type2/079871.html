Subject: Some more free stuff in MA (Cape Cod)


While we're on the subject..


I have a drivers side door in excellent condition free to anyone who can
come pick it up. Its complete minus the panel. Its from a '74 or '75 but I
tihnk
will fit '73 - '76 (list???)

Also have a 5 rib transaxle that needs a rebuild. free. It would be a
good core for anyone who wants to go that route. Its been sitting under an
overhang since  August. It worked ok until it started grinding in 3rd real
bad. could be easy to fix, but i don't do tranny work. She came out, used
tranny in....the cycle repeats.

This stuff is at my parents house in Yarmouth, and I really need to get
rid of it and a lot of other stuff (tin, engine stuff, some westy
parts). Whatever isn't free will be very cheap.


p-mail me eddie_at_gacker_dot_com with any questions.
