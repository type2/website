Subject: Here's the story...Of a lovely buh-us...

Well folks, I knew that this day would arrive.  This is the big one.  The
one repair that requires actual droppage of the engine; and I'm a virgin.
Wish me luck.

For the curious, here's the story.

Yall may remember some time in the near past I lamented the fact that I was
having to advance my timing to about 20 deg BTDC in order to get Maggie
running right.  Well, I was about to take off for the mountains, I went to
check on it, and I now had to advance it so far I could no longer even see
the timing mark with a strobe light.  So, I got out, took the valve covers
off and moved the engine to where #1 was at TDC (for those who don't know,
and I didn't until some nice folks at Strano's (see your Muir book) told
me, TDC for any cylinder as determined by valves is where the valves for
that cylinder are both loose (have lash), and moving the engine makes the
opposite cylinder's valves move in opposite directions (one in, one out)
(opposites: #'s 1 and 3, 2 and 4).  This is important information,
especially if you come across a bus with no timing marks on its pulley).
So anyway, I set #1 to TDC, checked down the distributor hole, and the slot
was about exactly 12 deg from centerline.  But the timing mark was way, way
from the 0 deg mark on the scale.  Hmmm, wasn't last time I set the valves,
&lt;200 miles.

Well, some of you no doubt see large bright danger signs like I should
have.  But all I could see was my beloved home, and my getting there.
Stuck the distributor in, timed it by ear (up to the point where engine
starts to miss, then back just a little)(Method again per good folks at
Strano's).  Took off, running great.

I'm on the road, enjoying the wonderful reds and golds and purples and that
equisite electric gray that only the afternoon sun shining on storm clouds
can make, when I noticed a red that decidedly did not blend in.  This is,
of course, the red light on the dash, the generator light.  Immediately
pull over, run around back, open the hood, and what did I see!  Oh my god,
the engine is running, but the fan is not turning.

So here I am, after much headache with towing, but after an abbreviated but
awesome trip home to Asheville, with my first engine pull.  Any tips are
welcome, of course.

Scratching my head and hoping I don't take up smoking again,
Eric
and a very sick Maggie
