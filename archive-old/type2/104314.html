Subject: Wobbly Tires (fixxed?)

Ok.. So I got several responses from &quot;you have enemies&quot; to &quot;tightening
hard isnt sufficient&quot;.

Well I went back out and started tightening.. Yes they were all loose,
except the fronts which were torqued. After closer inspection while
tightening the rears I noticed a small sliver of metal coming off the
drums. So, my conclusion is that I think the new drums are to blame and
not how I tightened them (air gun at a shop) so I'm going to recheck the
torque once a week until I'm satisfied that the torque remains sufficient.
I have a feeling that this will happen again.

P.S. List admin, I sent a message with 5 quoted lines. No headers no
nothing and it was rejected.
