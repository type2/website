I hexed myself by thinking that there simply wasn't another part on my 81 that
could be replaced. Tonight, after having driven 50 miles around Atlanta at 65
mph, I drop off a tape at Blockbuster and start to turn out onto the
sidestreet when the wheel just spins in my hands. No steering!

No warning, just absolute and utter failure. Scares the hell out of me when I
think of the high speed and mountain driving I've done recently. I've got a
new master cylinder on order from Ron Salmon 'cause I've only got 1/2 pedal
and now this. I don't have a clue what the steering workings are, I guess I'll
find out tomorrow.
