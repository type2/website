&gt; Yeah, just heard that. A NASCAR Camry... Riiiight (though true). Haven't

Well, Current NASCAR chassis design is closer to Formula 1 than Ford
Fairlane.  Nothing &quot;Stock&quot; about those tube frames.

The main goal of NASCAR is to make sure that all teams are evenly matched
so that they can take turns winning.  If a team or car wins too much,
they change the rules to slow them down.  Kind of the same philosophy as
professional wrestling!

 &gt; &gt; WRC - now we can talk... &lt;griN!&gt;

Preaching to the choir, there!
