Subject: [T2] [VB]alternator that i loaned to someone in the early 90s - hippie content

Im starting to work on my 79 westy, the &quot;super pickel&quot;, call it a
resurection project, not restoration if you will, anyway a memory flashed in
my brain. Sometime in the early 90s in the lot outside of buckeye lake amp
in Ohio, i loaned my spare alternator to some guy from the washingtion, DC
area. I would guess that he would be on one of these lists because he told
me that he had asked about 5000 people before he found me, signs of a vw
nut, and he had my address to return the alternator when he got home. I was
in a 79 green westy,(i had long hair and a tye dye with a beard, hehe) So if
you are the one or if this rings a bell, like you helped the guy install the
alternator or something, it would be nice if you get in touch with me,
because i will be needing the alternator back soon.
