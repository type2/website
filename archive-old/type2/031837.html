&gt; In the past 7 years I have had two EFI failures that brought me to a halt. 1st

neither one was a FI problem both were electrical

&gt; one was a double relay that gave up. 2nd happened on the way to Jerome 2 weeks

a double relay is still needed in a carb engine (fuel pump shut off if
engine stops)

&gt; ago = lost injector power because of the harness failure. I did not cut the

wiring harness failure will shut down any engine, just happened to be the
wire to the injectors
