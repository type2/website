Jack,
Excellent procedure but what you want instead of a Ford truck solenoid
is a headlight or horn relay.  Read Bob's sermon on solenoids for more
information, but the basic thing is that the Ford truck solenoid takes
almost as much current to activate as the VW solenoid, which kind of
defeats the purpose of the mod.  On my '78 I did this with an auxiliary
light relay (got it at the FLAPS, it's used for fog lights) which was
rated for 30 amps and it did great!  My current '81 has the Ford truck
solenoid mod, I'll have to see how well it holds up but I'm considering
removing it and putting in a regular relay.

&gt; The solenoid itself can be gotten from Checker (or its equivalent) for 
&gt; around $5US.  Just ask for a generic Ford truck solenoid.  It should come 
&gt; in one of two configurations, either a cross, with the two fat terminals 
&gt; (outputs) in one plane and two smaller terminals (inputs) in the other plane.
&gt; Or the two output terminals are in one plane and the two input terminals 
&gt; are on one side of the output terminal plane.  If you're not sure what's 
&gt; what ask the counterman (or woman, as the case may be).
