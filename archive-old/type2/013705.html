Swedging:
Is a method used to enlarge or reduce the size of many things, Examples:
Hydraulic fittings are Swedged onto the hose.
Automotive tailpipes are Swedged to a larger or smaller size to fit
inside or outside of another pipe.
Pipes on swing sets, bicycles, lawn chairs Etc are Swedged to make slip
together fit.
The same term is used with wire rope cable ends and such that are
Swedged.
The plastic part of the oil preasure sender is Swedged into the metal
part under a press.
It is a proper term for the method used by many cylinder head rebuilders
to define that the seats are *set* under high pressure to stay secure.
Staking or peening is mostly used to secure a nut or other item by
deforming the thread, adding a dimple or otherwise deforming the object
in some way to make it more secure.
Almost everybody that defined it is partially right.
However you must consider that AMC heads use this term and they are a
Spanish and Mexican company, European manufacturers may have other
general usage of the term.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is that the same thing as using a punch like tool to push 
&gt; heated metal over
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the edge of the valve seat?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The proper term for this is &quot;staking&quot;.  &quot;Swedging&quot; is compressing 
&gt; a metal sleeve onto a cable or somesuch, such as the throttle cable 
&gt; end.
