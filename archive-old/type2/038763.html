put your BAW on the nut' get a 6 ft breaker bar, set brakes (get someone
to stand on pedal too) chock the wheels (make sure cotter key is out??)
then jump on breaker bar, if it doesn't work, get a BIG heavy friend to
help you.

&gt; also been using penetrating oil like crazy and also a hand held propane torch 
&gt; to no avail. Any suggestions out there? or am i doomed to cutting the nut off 
&gt; and trying to find a replacement?

you don't have to find a whole new replacement stub axle. use a &quot;nut
spliter&quot; and put a new Castelated nut on, they are much easier to find
