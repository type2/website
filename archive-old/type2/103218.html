Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trends follies

Yeah I noticed how some very nice vehicles get little or no coverage by 
these magazines. Of course I will never forget the article that questioned 
to validity and purpose of a VW Eurovan camper. The author asked what was 
the point?

Well it is obvious to us - much better than a tent, you can store in the 
garage (if I had one), can use it all week to haul the family, and it isn't 
otherwise useless like a fullsize RV.

That was sort of the beginning of the end.

Also since I don't buy new cars every 3 years I don't really car what the 
new &lt;insert brand here&gt; is like. I'm more interested in what folks are 
doing with their cars and trucks and vans and sports cars than what the 
next new one is.

I've got a subscription to one (C&amp;D or R&amp;T - I can't remember - that's how 
much of an impact they make on my life... &lt;grin&gt;)  now. I read it in 20 
minutes and pass it on to family or friend. I won't renew when it is up.

&gt;Of course, check out the placement of ads vis-a-vis articles...A very long
&gt;time ago, the two mags had a distinct personality. R&amp;T was traditional
&gt;sports car oriented and Car and Driver was the brash up-start (Pontiac
&gt;GTO vs, the Ferrari GTO, for example). Both have become &quot;brands&quot; (think
&gt;'Nike'), more interested in being the flagship that pulls their flotilla of
&gt;for-
&gt;sale products along...
