Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel warning

alcohol would not settle out of gasoline.  to test this yourself get a 
bottle of everclear from you local medicinal purposes shop and pull a 
shot of gas from your tank. mix half  and half and let sit.  Also  as  
almost all gas in the US and  Canada now  has at least some alcohol in 
it  an alcohol tester will give a positive.  BTW carefully dispose of 
that everclear.  I recommend heavy dilutions with various mixative 
solutions to dilute and ice to keep it below its vaporization 
flammability point.  then dipose of by filtering.

&gt; further testing with an alcohol sensitve paste. Will keep you posted.
