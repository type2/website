Subject: Muffler/Cat for 79 - $40

I've switched my set up to the earlier heat exchangers and now realize I
have a muffler and cat that I do not need. They're fine shape, no rot
and were on the bus when I took it down for a rebuild. If anyone needs a
backup cat/muffler drop me a line. I can ship it out to you this week,
or if you're in the area you can pick it up at my house!
