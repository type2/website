John, are you married? 'Cause you'll be married to your bus if you get this
paint job. My guess is that you can get a paint job you're happy with for
the $3-3500 or less. BUT! &lt;there it is...you might have to go through some
patented VanBondo-style hassles in order to GET happy. Sounds to me like the
5-6,000 figure is what you'd be paying to guarantee you don't have to bring
your bus back to have drips fixed, etc. Of course, you still might have to
do all of that even after paying $6000. Remember the old saying, &quot;get it in
writing?&quot; Well, take your time, figure out what *you* want....how much of a
paint job do you want? Talk to lots of shops. Draft a contract. Ask a few if
they'd have a problem signing it. Make it say what YOU want it to say. For
some insight, search the archives for info from Rusty Van Bondo's &quot;Resto
from Hell&quot; (tm, Van Bondo). BTW, RVB and Jim Ellis are two sides of the same
coin. That confused me for a while, but either way you look at him,
Rusty/Jim has been drug through the coals on resto. It gets VERY expensive.
Be prepared to spend much more total time AND money than what you're
planning for the paint job alone. It won't end there.

If it were me, I'd take the $5,000, enroll in a auto body class at the local
tech college, buy a good compressor and airgun, build a garage on the side
of my house, buy the paint and supplies, and do it myself. Might even come
in under $5000. Of course, I rent, so I'd probably not REALLY build a
garage, and it I did, it probably would cost more than I thought, but I sure
wouldn't pay that much for a paint job either. Hmmmm...maybe I could put the
$5000 down on a house that already HAS a garage. Now there's a money-saving
idea! ;)

I painted my '71 with a gun and compressor by the side of my house. Won't do
that again, though. I had texture to the paint. It looked MUCH better than
before. It was protected from further rust (with old rust removed). But
still, I wasn't satisfied. My next bus (a '67 westy) will get all the prep
work done by me. I'll buy a welder, learn to weld, replace floor panels, cut
out any rust, sandblast, primer, fill body blemishes...keep a tarp over it
'cause primer is porous...I'll have someone else shoot it. I'll probably pay
$1000+paint. I'll do all the reassembly. I'll have between $3500 and $5000
total in the bus when I'm done (Rusty will be laughing at me about now, but
he's already given me fair warning of what to REALLY expect. Reality sucks,
so I'll keep living in MY world until I'm forced to move ;). I'll trailer it
to the paint shop. I'll rent a storage building for afterwards and let it
sit in there for a while so the paint can harden. I'll spend up to a year
getting ready to have it painted...maybe even longer. I'll figure 3-4 months
to put it back together. I may wind up paying for auto insurance that whole
time because of where I live. I'll pretend that doesn't add up and do lots
of nice things for Kristy so she won't mind much. I'll pay attention to
details to get it the way *I* want it. To heck with anal-retentive purists.
I may use phillips-head screws instead of slotted for the panelling -- so
THERE! When I'm done, I'll have more real ownership in my bus than most
people ever have in anything. That's what I like about the process. But it
costs...and it turns your vehicle into a project/hobby for a period of time.
While it's in resto-limbo, it's not transportation.

Do what makes sense for you. If you're not into the work, $5000 is probably
worth it for avoiding the headaches.._dot_cause everytime I've tackled a 2-hour
bodywork project, it's taken 10-12 hours. Whatever you do, good luck! Glad
to hear you're protecting your bus for the next 25 years! BTW, where will
you park the bus once this paint job is done?
