Subject: head install update

listees:)
just an update on my head install.   as you may
remember i installed an AVP head on my 73 1800cc bus
and something just wasnt right.   i thank all who
replied with advice, i checked and double checked
everything, but still a miss at top end, a backfire
and limited power.   well feeling that my wallet was
way too full i brought it by my local vw guru and
lizzy is finally on the road and all better.   turns
out when i got the head from AVP, they neglected to
fully tighten the rocker arm studs into the head, so
when i started driving they would loosen just enough
to cause small valve leaks, and an overall bad running
bus.   other than that small,(but very frustrating)
problem the head seems to be performing well and i can
finally enjoy it after 5 months down time.   well
heres hoping i can now get my core head charge back
from AVP and all will be well.
