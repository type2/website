Subject: keys

The code number is stamped on all the locks.  On the door locks, it is on 
the tailpiece.  Various places on other locks.  It will be the format of 
##R###.  It is not available from VW through the VIN.  I also decode the key 
by sight and determine the correct cuts, but I'm a locksmith.
