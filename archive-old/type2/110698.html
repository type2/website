Here in sunny SoCal we don't even need bad parkers to knock our cars off
of jackstands.  Sometimes Mother Nature will do it for us!  for this
reason, I never get under a vehicle unless there are a couple of spare
wheels under it so that it can't drop to a height less than my own
thickness.  I also leave the lifting jack in place.
