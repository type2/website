Subject: Re: [T2] Rust Converter's Results and Finding's.

The rust converter isn't a high fill item--so the pot holes won't get
filled ---
You can't spot putty or lay a light coat of Bondo on them --the Bondo
won't stick to the rust converter--and the rust converter is made to
bond / react to the rusty metal-- a no win situation so the pot holes
stay--

Hmm, I've found that body filler will stick to the stuff. Well, perhaps not
over an area completely painted with POR 15.
On my old '76 Westy I had quite a bit of rust around the lower windshield
frame-typical. I ground out as much of the rust as I could without going all
the way through the metal. This left deep gouges in metal with some traces of
rust, which I painted with POR 15, then covered with a thin skim of good
quality body filler (notice I didn't say &quot;Bondo&quot;, pet peeve of mine, Bondo is
a brand name, and is complete crap-I'd never use the stuff). This repair
lasted for at least the 3 years I owned that bus, maybe more. But, I think of
POR 15 as more for use on the chassis, inner fender wells, and interior nooks
and crannies where you are likely to find rust in our old buses. I would also
use it a temporary measure to stop rust on, say, a rocker panel until a proper
repair could be done, but not because I don't think it wouldn't hold up, but
for appearances sake. You seem to have such an intense dislike for this
product that I didn't really expect you to become a convert-all I know is it
has worked for me.   Jeff
