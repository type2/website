Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust Torque

16 ft-lbs per Bentley. I wouldn't even try 18. Ask me how I know.

I can't seem to find the specs to torque down my exhaust manifolds to
cylinder heads (with copper gasket in between).  It is an 8mm stud i believe
with a
13 mm hex on it.  I was thinking 18 foot-pounds, but if anyone has the true
specification of the torque, let me know.
