Hi Joel, 

Maybe some ducting may help. Lets assume you blow air 
through the oil cooler from underneath into the small 
space above it. Block the front facing side of the 
space above the cooler leaving the rear open, then build 
a shroud around the fan, closed on the rear and open on 
the front ..  drawing/being charged by air out of the 
air stream under the car.

Hope it helps, 

Brian
