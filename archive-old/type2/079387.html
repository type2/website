&gt; The easiest way to fit the sliding door seal is to undo the two bolts

&gt; be seen from INSIDE of the bus just below the window). Then with the
&gt; door ajar, WHILE SUPPORTING THE DOOR (bloks, axle stand, jack,
&gt; helper...), pull the hinge mechanism out, pop the seal through the
&gt; gap, slide the hinge back into the door. In my experience this is much

&gt; track.

Err... Bob....

On US spec buses there are four bolts.  Two are accesible from inside the
bus, at the rear of the door about half way up. If your bus is a passenger
model and very original they may be covered with black plastic caps.  The
other two are inside the rear lip of the door.  Pop the door open and look
in the gap at the rear.  All four are 10mm heads.  After they are out,
removal of the hinge goes as you say.

On replacement, it is important to center the door in its opening at the
rear for the seal to do its job.  A two-person job, alas, with someone
holding the door in position while the second snugs the bolts.
