Subject: ignition help/mechanic problems

Hello All,

First a little background...I bought my first VW this summer, a '78 camper
which up until 2 weeks ago was driving wonderfully.  I personally have
absolutely no mechanic knowledge, less what I have learned reading the
list and the archives. So on 2 occassions my bus has died. She just sort
of loses power- no violent jerking or loud noises. And its very
intermittent. The last time it happened I was still on my street. I called
a local towguy to see what he would charge for a 1/4 mile tow and he told
me he has worked on air cooled busses and would be glad to take a look at
it.
So now he is telling me that the electronic ignition (which was all put in
last year new by the po, Its a pertronix) is just problematic and that I
should go back to points. I think that this seems rather insane but due to
my limited knowledge have no idea what to do now. I am hoping some of the
vw gurus out there could bestow some of their knowledge upon me. Thanks in
advance!

Megan
