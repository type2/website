Subject: Re: [T2]  Waterbed (was Now I've Heard It All!)

Rob,

Ask how many gallons the mattress holds..figure about 8lbs/gallon
for weight....

Let us know how it all comes out&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I too have entertained the thought of putting in a waterbed. I sleep on one

&gt; 
&gt; Some thoughts are taking a super single matress and making a full cabinet
&gt; from the upper engine hatch out to where the bed would end for it to rest
&gt; on. You would probably also have to make some sort of retaining frame around
&gt; the whole thing to keep the mattress in place and have a good liner.
&gt; 
&gt; You would lose passenger seating and the bed could only be filled at the
&gt; campsite as I imagine it would be too heavy to drive with that much water.
&gt; Plus if for any reason it burst you would have a bad situation. Might even
&gt; have to remove the cabinet in most buses.
&gt; 
&gt; I am really thinking of doing this down the road though. If anyone has any
&gt; insights they are welcome. Maybe some of you have put in an air mattress and
&gt; can say if it works good or not.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course I know this is an impractical modification.
