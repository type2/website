Subject: [T2] Kadrons  on 72up bus motor

&gt; Has anyone put Kadrons on a Type 4 bus motor ?

i think so, but i have never seen it or done it, but it can be done.

&gt; could you use the stock manifolds ?

doubt it, kadrons are bigger than solex 34s. I hear FAT performance makes
kadron type4 manifolds. they don't have a website yet. 1558 N Case St.,
Orange, CA 92667     (714)637-2889

Hope this helps,
