&gt; The engine went in yesterday (Monday) after work.  After uncrossing a 
coupla 
&gt;  spark plug wires, it cranked up within one revolution like it used to.  
What 
&gt; 
&gt;  a thrill!  Everything in the instrument cluster reads spot on!  The CHT 
&gt; gauge 
&gt;  reads higher, however.  Anyone out there experience readings of 375 with 
the 
&gt; 
&gt;  sender mounted near the #3 exhaust port?  The old sender was mounted under 
a 
&gt; 
&gt;  &quot;stud&quot; right above the #3 spark plug (it had been broken for nearly a 
year) 
&gt;  and it would max out at about 350.
Hi Chris;
I've had my sender like you under a head stud.  And at the same time I was 
running an oil temp sender that was part of the screw that holds the spring 
in place for the oil pressure relief valve.  They read exactly the same.  
Then I tried the &quot;under the spark plug&quot; location and my spark plug came loose 
(after many miles) and damaged my head, but I got great readings.  I would 
see reading of 325 to 350 at 60 to 65 (closer to 60) flat road 75 to 80 
ambient, no head or tail wind.
Now I'm running the sender between two fins pushed all the way to the base of 
the fins, on the underside of the cylinder head, about where the spark plug 
would be and I see very similar temps. 
I have a friend who owns a sole proprietor business building Super Vee's.  
He's been doing this for over 20 years and has forgotten more than I'll ever 
know.  I asked him a while back about head temps and his comment was &quot;it all 
depends on the sender location&quot;.
It sounds to me like you have your sender in an excellent location.  I 
believe the part of the head you want to monitor is the part right around the 
exhaust valve seat.  After all that is where the problems happen.  
If you want to be scientific about it you could find out what the alloy is 
that the head is made of and from there find out what temp it starts to 
soften significantly at.  Then don't get hotter than that.
Or, you could drive awhile and see what temps you get under various 
conditions.  Then use that information as a base line for your driving.  
I typically drive around 60 and if there's no tail or head wind I'll see 325 
or so.  
Where I find the gauge invaluable is when I'm driving into a head wind and 
don't realize it.  The gauge will tell me if I'm pushing too hard.  
The gauge will give you an accurate indication of what's going on with your 
engine, so you won't have to guess if you're pushing too hard or not hard 
enough.  
So when you're about to start climbing a pretty big hill and you look down 
and the head temp is already higher than &quot;normal cruising temp&quot; you know not 
to attack the hill really hard.
It will also tell you when it's &quot;safe&quot; to drive 70 and when you need to slow 
down a bit.  
Sometimes I think I use my CHT gauge more than my speedometer.
This technique has worked well for me.  I rebuilt my last engine at 137,000 
miles when the transmission went out.  The engine was still going strong.
I'm currently running my '71 Westy with 1800 cc's (96.5 mm bore X 70 mm 
stroke) and a stock carb.  I have enough power to drive 70 + all the time, 
but it would burn up if I did.
I hope this looong post helps.  
If you look into this further and find out the alloy and it's &quot;safe&quot; temps 
please share the info.
Tim
&quot;71 Westy
