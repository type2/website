&gt; &gt; So, here I am, recently relocated to Annapolis MD looking for leads
&gt; &gt; on mechanics and body repair shops.   I have 2 young kids and a ton


&gt; also in Baltimore there is a guy at Old Harford and Taylor ave that works
&gt; on all but auto trannys he has a good reputation but his name escapes me

DAMON's I remembered!!!!!

maybe I&quot;ll get my bus running better than my memory
