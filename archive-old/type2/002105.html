&gt;I don't think a bilge pump would pump enough water to make this feasible.


Hey Jim, check out Rule Industries' website
http://www.rule-industries_dot_com/nautoidx.htm They make pumps from 360 gal per
hr to 8,000 gph.

While I think capacity is not a problem for bilge pumps, heat may be.  They
are not designed to pump continuously at 180 degrees or better.  I have a
Rule 360 circulating 130 degree water in my small solar water heater three
to five hours per day, but no catastrophes happen if it quits.  Then again,
the stock oil cooler would not be impaired in the cooling systems we're
discussing, so it might be worth experimenting.

Eron Crites suggested a VW watercooled's circulation pump.  Seems like a
good match.

&gt;
&gt;But if you insist on converting an aircooled VW into a watercooled one....

I'm not unhappy with the aircooled idea.  Wish they'd continued with it.  I
love my engine.   But if we could improve cooling and winter heating without
doing anything to the engine more invasive than adding a spin-on oil
diverter between it  and the filter, that would be a good thing, wouldn't
it?

Regards,

Grant
