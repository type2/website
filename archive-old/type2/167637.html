&gt; Having not pulled an engine in a bus I am wondering about the balance point

&gt; a jack. i just have two big floor jacks, but in my experience pulling motors

won't fit thru the top, but you could use a crane to pull the engine and
lower it onto a dolly.

&gt; one and giving it a try, just not sure if the balance point would be too far

balance point is about where the 2&amp;4 exhaust ports are. of course this is
affected by some things like the weight of the muffler or flywheel if one
or both are there.  also weather it is an automatic or a manual has a lot
to do with the angles and how far it has to go etc.

&gt; to the rear to make it work, or should I just go buy some sturdy steel beams
&gt; and jack the car up a good 4 feet? Looking for some practical knowedge
&gt; before i unbolt everything and drop the damn thing on my foot.

if the engine were on the ground (Type IV engine) you need about 6-8 more
inches so you only need to raise it that much plus the height of whatever
it is on top of. dolly/jack etc.
