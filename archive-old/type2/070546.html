Subject: Putting tin on bus engine
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

We are assembling the engine for china Cat, my son's 75 Westy. We are nearly 
at the point of getting the heads on, and I'm worried about the tin. When we 
disassembled this 1.8L T-4, we had to wiggle and force the cylinder tin off 
as the heads came off. I don't look forward to doing the reverse of that 
process, as it was not at all &quot;procedural&quot;., but rather like random force.

I've looked through all my books, and there is no detailed procedure for 
this, so I'm thinking somehow I did it wrong in taking this tin off.

Will someone who has done this please tell me the sequence and the method ro 
re-installing this tin?

Thanks a zillion/Don Carron
