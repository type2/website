Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Insulation

I love to listen to it loud but there's a time and place for everything. At home it's with headphones or during the daytime with the house closed up. Or on the interstate. That's when I like loud music the best but not with our kiddo in the backseat getting his ears ruined. I come from a long line of people with poor hearing late in life so I'm taking care of mine - earplugs/headphone when I'm making sawdust or mowing, etc. etc. 

Already I'm having hearing problems...  I can't hear instructions for household chores I don't want to do, never could hear homework assignments when I was a kid, etc. etc. &lt;grin!&gt;

Chris
