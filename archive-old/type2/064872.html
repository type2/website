Hi Mike,

 I'm new to the list, just got on this week, and could n't resist
responding to your post!

I just finished restoring my 67 deluxe of 23 yrs ownership. It 
took two years, $21,000, and wasnt in that bad shape! But now,
all the houses know me by name (WW, Vintage, WCM, etc) and it
looks and is, great.

Heating system fully rebuilt from &quot;Y&quot; to cab inlet. Works great!

Anyway, you're getting off cheap!  :-)
