Subject: rear window defogger

     I am redoing the wires to the rear window defogger on my 79 bus.  In
CH4, section 11 of the Bentley (pg 37), it is stated the there is a relay to
control the temprature of the rear window.  In the wiring diagram listed for
my 79, there is no relay listed.  I have followed the diagram from the
window up front to the switch &amp; then to S10 on the fuse block.  I can find
no relay.  I understand it to just be a hot wire from the ignition side to
the switch &amp; then to the window.  There is a ground on the switch.  What
does the everyone think?  I want to do this right.  Any insight would be
appretiated.
