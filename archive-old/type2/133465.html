&gt; &gt; The bolt that holds the pulley attached to the crankshaft came out.  I

&gt;
&gt; it's the smoke in the mirrors that worries me about this scenario.
&gt;
&gt; which idiot light came on, by the way? the &quot;GEN&quot; light should have come on
&gt; as soon as the pulley/fan stopped turning.

right that happened immediately when it happened to me, in fact I thought
I had broken a fan belt until I saw my oil temp climbing....

&gt; if you had the OIL light come on after 3 miles of no fan, i am afraid that
&gt; chances are good the engine has been severely overheated. this would also
&gt; imply the GEN light was not working properly.

mine was pushing the edges of overheating in very cold weather in less
than a mile...

so I suspect you are right, I never saw smoke at all.
