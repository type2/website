Spotted recently for sale, any interest? 

'71 Camper, fixed fiberglass hightop.  Recent engine rebuild. $1900.
Took a quick look at this one.  Engine has original type equipment,
ie, no goofy carb or air cleaner, case has sticker as a rebuild.
Body is in great shape, no major or even minor dings noted, no 
obvious rust noted.  Didn't crawl around and check it out, as soccer 
game was starting soon.
I left the phone number at home, unfortunately.  If there's interest 
I'll call my SO at home later today, or get it for you tomorrow.

Found in the Sacramento paper, interesting opportunity -

'59 Karmann Ghia resto project.  Almost done.  Needs to be put 
together.  Everything there but paint.  $1200 or trade for '55-'61 
VW.  916-674-2367

Rusty, the price you are asking for the '80 is a good price. 
Comparable to ones in this area.  Have seen AC Vanagons for $900 to
$4000 as an ASKING price, as to what they actually GO for . . . 
'80 rebuilt Westi $3000, '81 lots new parts mint $3600 obo, Saturday

Ususal disclaimers . . 

There are always VW busses in the Sacto paper for sale, occasionally 
I can find a San Francisco paper.  If there is particular vehicle you 
are looking for, post it &amp; I'll keep an eye out, otherwise I'll just 
post the more unusual opportunities.
