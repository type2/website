Subject: Re: [T2] A/C in the South

Spoiled? Which generation are you speaking of?

Well, even my dad, who was born and raised in the oppressive South 
Carolina heat and humidity (a LONG time ago) admits that life in the 
South without A/C would have kept many (most) larger cities from ever 
fully developing. Charleston, included. He would have never moved back 
to the Low Country if A/C was not available, and I personally think 
that the desire to NOT sweat one's brains out...not too mention ruining 
dress shirts, wool suits and having a generally disheveled 
appearance...is a good thing.

Had I been born before A/C was invented I surely would have NEVER left 
California. Or Keflavik, for that matter. Or, I would have invented 
A/C.

Yeah.
