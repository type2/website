Salut Pat
I own a 71 too, and I have just finished a novel call Volkwagen Blues.  At 
the end of the story, their 71 westfalia ran hot in the desertland and they 
had to stop.  The girl, who is a mechanic, find that it was a &quot;gaz trap&quot; in 
the fuel pump.  That mean that fuel make a change of state and become 
volatil inside the pump, making the diaphragm useless.  Of course they 
cleaned the filter inside the pump.  waiting will do the same but it will 
continue on later.
