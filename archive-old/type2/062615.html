&gt;The 25, 36, &amp; 40 hp engines used copper gaskets between the heads and jugs.
&gt;
&gt;The 1300, 1500, &amp; 1600 engines did not use any gasket at all!

&gt;Spacer shims are added to the bottom of the jugs to drop CR on all engines.

Oh.

Well, why does it make a difference, compression-ratio-wise, whether you
put them under the cylinder or on top of it?

This all shows you how much *I* know. I never heard of putting them under
the cylinder before. And I have got 1600 rebuilds that had spacers on top.
Of course the engine I'm thinking of blew up after a few hundred miles. But
I don't think that's why. ;)

Are the &quot;shims&quot; that go under, of some different constuction than the
&quot;spacers&quot; that go over?
