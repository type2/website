Subject: Additional Marker Lights

I have a '70 Type 2 with two sets of additional rear marker lights
directly above the tail lights and side marker lights, and a set of
front marker lights directly above the front turn signals. The extra
lights in the rear are red and the set up front is amber. The lenses are
roughly the size and shape of the back-lights. The rear lights are
spliced onto the wires for the tail lights. I'm not sure how the front
set is hooked up. The brand name is &quot;Deitz.&quot;

Has anyone seen these before? I bought the van from the original owners
11 years ago and never realized that these lights weren't stock
equipment until just recently.

Any insight appreciated.

Craig.
