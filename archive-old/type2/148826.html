Subject: Engine seal

I purchased a engine seal today for my 78 Bus and installed it immidiatly. 
But now that I think of it Im not sure if I put it in right. Is the foam part 
suppose to be showing or should it be underneath. I have the foam part down and 
the solid black part showing. Does anybody know if this is correct? I am also 
taking a road trip and would like to know if anybody could offer any advice or 
precautions. It is my first trip in the bus since i bought it about 3-4 
months back. The trip will be 200 miles total. I live in california.
                                                                As always 
thanks for the help,
                                                                            
Dave
