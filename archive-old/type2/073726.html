--part1_14b.275d526.28faf0e9_boundary

This is a wonderful offer, I have a little over ten years worth of &quot;VW 
Trends&quot; and &quot;hot VWs&quot; Some from June 1988 to December 2000. Most years are 
complete (year) sets, to include some not yet opened. If anyone is 
interested, e-mail me and I will compile an inventory. Make me an offer. 
There are a lot of good stories, information, and techniques to better 
improve you way of doing things. You also pay shipping.
