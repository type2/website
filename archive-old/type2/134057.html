Subject: upgrading to 73+ brakes?

while the 70 has the beam from an early 72 on i,  anyone with those 
early disks knows what a pain in the a$$ it is to get calipers, 
etc... so i am looking at upgrading to 73+ units. i know i need new 
spindles and calipers, but what else? do i need to change backing 
plates or rotors?  are wheel bearings the same?
as for the booster can, will 73 - 79 master cylinders fit BOTH the 8&quot; 
and 10&quot; versions, or is there a difference somewhere.
