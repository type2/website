Subject: Seized engine

Well yesterday started out to be a pretty good day.  Went to the license 
bureau and got my bus registered and got her new plates, got her insured and 
then did some test driving and some carb and timing adjustments.  This was 
not only the first time I had driven my bus but the first time I had driven 
any bus and things were going pretty well.  I did some adjustments to the 
timing and then took it for the last drive of the evening and the running oil 
pressure started to drop...uh oh...then red light and NO oil pressure...oh _at_#&amp;
$(!     By the time I got her safely off the road and reached for the 
key...it just stopped.   Won't turn over with the starter at all.    I didn't 
have the heart to even look at it, just pushed it home and into the garage.  
I spent a couple of years of time here and there scrounging and putting this 
bus together.  Just makes me sick.  And I am amazed that it did this, 
everything that went into building that engine was 100 percent ok, mic'd, 
measured and cleaned and all.  Can't blame the builder because it was me ; )  
In hindsight the engine did seem &quot;tight&quot; when turned over by hand after the 
cylinders and rings were installed, but not abnormal.
  I guess I will pull the engine again and see what went wrong, but talk 
about disappointed, I just kind of feel like forgetting the whole thing.  So 
much work on the thing for so long for so little time driving it, and now 
this.   Bummer.
