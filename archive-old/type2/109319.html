Subject: radio install question

Ok I figured out where to hook up all the wires except one.  My new unit wants
me to hook up a wire to the car light control switch?  Has anyone run into
this before?  Do they mean the headlight switch and if so can it be done?
How?
Thanks in advance...

Peace brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
