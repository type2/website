Subject: RE: [T2] wheels and tires in the time of cholera.

&gt; Shorter sidewalls are also notoriously harder riding...It's 
&gt; your butt sittin' right over those short sidewalls... ;-(


That is true. If you are trying to maintain the same overall tire height as
stock (which keeps the speedo accurate) but with bigger wheels, this
requires a shorter-sidewall tire  - which will result in a harder ride, all
things being equal. That's the downside to the latest &quot;import tuner&quot; rage,
combining humongous wheels with extremely low-profile tires. They may look
cool (kewl?:-), but driving down the the road your &quot;pimped ride&quot; feels more
like a pimped go-cart. Of course some of these people are putting 20 inch
wheels on a subcompact.  We're not talking about quite the same extreme in
the case of a bus.
