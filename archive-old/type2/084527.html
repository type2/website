&gt;Andrew,
&gt;I also live about 12 miles from town, and I have the same model fuel guage:
&gt;reads well when tank is full but after 30 miles it reads empty. I am waiting
&gt;to fix it until I have to remove the engine anyway. In the mean time, I have
&gt;a post-it note on the dash on which I write down the mileage for the next
&gt;fill-up. To be on the safe side, I fill after 150 miles (250km?) even though
&gt;I get more miles than that out of a tank of gas.

Initially I did the same, except I used one of those little plastic mileage 
indicators with the moveable dials so you can set it to any mileage.  Got 
it at Poop Boys for a few dollars.  You could also do what I did later - 
install a Vanagon speedo and use the trip meter.  :-)  I can almost 
guarantee you that your sender is bad as my symptoms were identical to 
yours.  I've heard that it's possible to swap out the sender with the tank 
in place, without cutting through the floor!  If you're a contortionist 
maybe?  Not tried it though.  I removed my tank while the engine was out 
for a rebuild (and even then it was a dirty, PITA job).

&gt;Just yesterday I filled up
&gt;after pushing the mileage limits a bit. The book says that the tank holds
&gt;14.8 gallons but the fuel pump registered 14.9! I guess I cut that one a
&gt;little close.

I've put as much as 15.2 gallons in without running out, but I fill it 
until the fuel level is 2&quot; below the cap.  I have to put the last 2 gallons 
or so in very slowly.


&gt;Anyway, just set yourself a reasonable mileage range between fill-ups and
&gt;fix the sender when you have the engine out for other work.

I think that's a great idea!
