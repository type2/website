Hello All

Hope all out you have a good Thanksgiving. A four day weekend allows
much VW time and you still have plenty of family time.

A while ago I had advertised I had a full width bench seat from my bus
(1970 Kombi), which I had no use for.  Unfortunately due to shipping
problems, meaning I live on the east coast, the interested parties on
the west coast, I still have it.  However, through the conversations
with the people interested I got the impression they are not common.
I'm curious how rare they are?  Mine is in excellent condition but I now
have a camper, which it won't fit into very well.  I had gotten in years
ago at a VW swap meet.  I'd love to pass it on to someone, but shipping
it across the country is probably $50+ making it difficult to justify
it.  If I know it's worth more than that I might be able to justify
attempting to sell it to those western folks.

I'm not doing this to make much money I just don't want someone to pay
all that to ship something that's not worth the shipping costs.

Thanks
Brent
