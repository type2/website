&gt;I feel I'm going to have to pull it again based on the compression

&gt;
&gt;cold compression test
&gt;#1 - 129
&gt;#2 - 128
&gt;#3 - 121
&gt;#4 - 115
&gt;
&gt;Warm compression test
&gt;#1 - 119
&gt;#2 - 123
&gt;#3 - 111
&gt;#4 - 106

&gt;I just set the valves so they should be alright.  The engine lopes as it
&gt;idles.  Though it has a mild cam (I don't know the type), It doesn't
&gt;have that performance cam type lope.  Idle adjustments will not raise
&gt;the engine speed above 850-900 rpms.
&gt;Can anyone help me out.

The compression is not off enough to cause a lope in the idle, IMO.  I feel
the cam is a more likely culprit.  You mention that you don't know the
specs of your cam... I would find out.  In the meantime, pull the wires one
at a time and find out if it is one cylinder not firing at idle, and go
&gt;from there.
