Subject: How do I clean out my Gas Tank???

Dear all,
  Greetings from San Francisco USA. I've got the engine out of my '74
Westy, so I thought I'd clean out the gas tank whilst I have the chance.
I've never done this before, as the actress said to the bishop.....  
QUESTIONS:
 1) What's the procedure YOU have used? I'm new to this VW lark and
don't have the funds to get the professionals to recondition every part
of the bus. So the gas tank will be my job.
 2) Should I remove the tank with fuel in or should I do it empty? I'm
under the impression that the gasoline vapour is even more volatile than
the gas itself. What do you do?
 3) The gas gauge goes from half tank straight to zero, what should I be
looking to repair or replace to rectify this. 

Hope you can help!!!

Paul Heasman.

'74 Westy &quot;Delilah&quot;
