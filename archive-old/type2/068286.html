Subject: Re: Busses and horns...

&gt;Do people really use horns?  Like most VW busses, I don't even know if 
&gt;mine works, or what it sounds like.  By the time I need a horn, I'm too 
&gt;busy trying to drive the bus to worry about expressing indignation.
&gt;
Before I fixed it, my '85 Westy's horn only worked when the steering wheel 
was turned slightly right of center.  So when somebody pissed me off, I was 
forced to make a quick right turn in order to express my indignation.  This 
was particularly challenging when I was in the left lane of a 4-lane 
highway at the time.
