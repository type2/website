Subject: Meaning of Life

I bought a '73 VW Standard Bus two weeks ago today. In the process of
questions and answers toward the culmination of the sale, after which I
thought might seem to the seller like alot of questions, I jokingly asked
him...&quot;What is the meaning of life?.&quot; He replied, &quot;rolling down the road to
nirvana in your VW Bus.&quot; I of course took this in the spirit of the moment,
but last Thursday after getting the thing running and driving it home under
it's own power....it was the most fun I have had in some time...my cheeks
hurt from smiling. Was it the meaning of life...not quite...I do have
thoughts on that which are not appropriate for this forum...but it was a
total great time!

Thank you,
