&gt;    How do we know when the distributor itself is shot? You really only hear

&gt; itself...except via tales of modification, etc...

Rachel,

I don't know of a commonly used test, as distributors are fairly
long-lived beasts, but here are things I look for:

Electrical continuity
  There is a wire that bridges the points plate to the case that
occasionally breaks.  Check it by testing for continuity between the fixed
part of the points and the case of the distributor.  There should be 0
resistance.  You might also check to be sure that when the points are
open, there is infinite resistance between the moving arm and the case
(never had this happen, but it might)

Worn cam lobes.
  The lobes can wear a *lot* before this gets to be a problem, but if you
can't set dwell or if, after it's set it bounces wildly, then they are too
far gone.  Always use that little pill of grease that comes with new
points!!! :-)

Advance mechanism
 Vacuum:
  On vacuum advance, you should be able to suck on the hose hard enough to
get it to advance.  If there is no resistance to suction then the diaphram
is holed and you need at least a new advance pot.  If all the suction you
can apply by lung won't move the plate, then the plate is stuck.  usually
it can be freed up by hand and lubricated.  (if the dist is a combination
vacuum/mechanical, it may be stuck because the mechanical end is fubar,
see below)

Mechanical:
  well, y'all know my opinion of mechanical advance dists :-) but some
years used a combination dist, so here goes.  Pull the dist, spin it by
hand, in both directions, see if it makes thrashing, broken spring noises.
you can't spin it fast enough by hand to get the advance to work, all you
can do is install it and put a timing light on it.

Bearings
  the dist shaft should not rock at all and should not move up and down
more than a hair.  If you slap a dwell meter on the car, and measure
dwell, it should stay close to the same at all RPM's.  If it changes
substantially, then there may well be too much play in the dist shaft. the
shaft rises as the drive gear pushes it up and the points are now riding
on a different (and less worn) section of the cam lobes.  As a result you
timing changes substantially with no input from the advance mechanism
(bad, really bad)

Those are my thoughts, anyone else got any others?

You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. 
Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. 
In the name of G*d, go!
