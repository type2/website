&lt;&lt;Fuel tank not venting.   When you take fuel out of the tank, air has to
go back in or else the tank will collapse.  Ever try to suck Pepsi out
of a bottle?  This will show up on long trips on the highway.
Try running without the fuel filler cap for a while.  (Don't do this
when the tank is full.)&gt;&gt;

Thanks for your help, one thing caught my eye that you sent.  I currently have
the charcoal tank rebreather just venting into the engine compartment since i
don't have stock carbs with the hook-up for it, doesn't that have to do with
gas tank venting or something?  Althogh it seems weird that tt went away right
after i replaced the fuel pump and there was no problem for many months until
now.  Or does that have nothing to do with my problem.

Thanks much for your help,
Shawn
