&gt; Subject: LiMBO/NEATO TTT Directory - anyone use?

&gt; ...I've called someone, they are shocked and it takes me a while
&gt; to explain how I got their number.  For the most part they don't
&gt; seem too friendly as I expected/hoped. :(  I would hope to use it
&gt; as I travel, but don't want to impose on these people.  has
&gt; anyone used it to greater success?

Maybe it's the diesel smell...just kidding :)

But back to your question...I haven't had occasion to use the TTT
on the road, since I don't travel all that much.  I *have*
however, had people call me.  Maybe the surprise you've
experienced is because it happens so infrequently, they forget
they're listed.  A call &quot;out of the blue&quot; can elicit a big &quot;huh?&quot;
when you're called in from mowing or partying or whatever.  I've
been listed in TTT since 1991 and can remember only four
&quot;contacts&quot; in that time.

1) Two guys in an early bay-window had a punctured push-rod tube.
They stopped in a nearby town for parts and came to my place
(after calling).  They used my barn, jack and some tools to pull
the engine, pull the heads and replace the push-rod tubes and
seals.  They camped overnight in my yard (3 acres in the
country), had the engine back in by noon and were on their way.

2)  A fellow named Stephan, from Montreal, was travelling around.
Something like 28,000 miles on the road in the last four months.
He was passing through and needed a place to stay while he
attended a nearby VW show.  Seems to me it was fairly hot and he
appreciated setting up is bay window camper in one of my sheds
(out of the sun).  He stayed two nights and moved on.

3) Some geography-challenged fellow called to see if I knew of
any good VW mechanics around St. Louis.  His interest wained when
I pointed out that I'm located 4 hours away from St. Louis.

4)  A Deadhead about an hour away had blown an engine (1800 I
think) and asked if I knew of any available in the area.  I gave
him a couple of phone numbers and never heard another word.

I suspect the &quot;reception&quot; is a function of making sure the person
knows you're talking NEATO/LiMBO (most are not in both).  Then it
begins to make sense to the person on the other end of the phone.
Some of us eat VWs, sleep VWs and drink VWs so we're in-tune when
a question comes up.  Others have a bus behind the garage and
*lots* of other things on their minds.

Also, most bus owners are used to keeping the beast alive, but
may not know all the variations and combinations of bus-stuff.  I
have '67s and an '84 wasserboxer.  Someone starts talking Type IV
engines and I'm only following &quot;in concept&quot; because I have no
hands-on Type IV experience.

TTT has plenty of little codes to tell whether the people can
provide help, are available in *emergency only* situations or
just offer &quot;coffee and conversation&quot; so check the codes to see
what you can expect.

BTW, I'm Jim in DeKalb, Illinois, offer mechanical help, a place
and tools for working on a bus, have camping space and the coffee
is always on.
