Subject: [T2] heater boxes

Help,

    I just put on some new heater boxes that i purchased from Nikki Elco and
they aren't sitting right against the engine.  I think my old studs that
come out of the engine may have been bent and are holding the heater box
from fitting exactly up against the engine.  I can feel air shooting out
from around the exausht manifold.  I think i am going to replace the old
studs and get new gaskets.  Does anyone have any tips for me or help.

This is the second time i put these guys on and it is worse instead of
better. If someone knows of the best place to get the studs and gaskets i
would really appreciate it.
