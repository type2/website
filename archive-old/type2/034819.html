&gt; heck I have been using a BIG pipe wrench for about 20 years. never had any

On my recent trip to Ga I spent about 45 minutes with a file and sour look
on my face working over an axle nut that had been &quot;pipe wrenched&quot; by a PO
as the pin wouldnt go in. On my food chain of choices for axle nut
Best - 46 MM socket / 3/4&quot; breaker bar / Big Pipe
Better - Dog Bone and BFH (Thats Big F****** Hammer)
Emergency only _ Pipe Wrench or Chisel-BFH Combo.
