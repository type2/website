Subject: Squeaking when I shift

Greetings, 

I am new to the VW world and auto mechanics in general but am having a great time working on my bus.  I've got a minor (I think- anyway its annoying) problem with my shifting. Whenever I move the shifter from the right to the left or front to back I hear a rather loud dry squeaking noise coming from somewhere along the shifting rod (sounds like its coming from the general area between the sink and the rear facing seat).  Its a 1970 westfalia.  What can I do to fix this? and is it serious? Thanks for taking on the newbie question and the help. 

Asaph
