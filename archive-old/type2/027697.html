Frankie,and everyone else too,
  You asked  &quot;Also what is the difference between GL4 and GL5?&quot;
While I don't know exactly what the difference is I do know that they are 
NOT interchangeable.  Most autoparts people will tell you that GL5 is fine 
to use in your bus, because it's a newer and better spec.  Not so.  As it 
turns out, there is something in GL5 that causes corrosion in(I think) the 
bronze bushings  in our old buses.  Hunt around and find GL4.
