Subject: Removing rear drums--that big nut
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Kevin Snow started the conversation about rear drum removal which prompted a
discussion about the difficulty of removing the large rear wheel center nut.

One of the best tool investments I ever made lots of years ago and I think the
thing is still available today and advertised in Hot VW's is an iron tubing
bar device with a drilled fixture on the end that is kind of rectangular
shaped with lots of strategically located holes in it. It also has a large
round open area in the center of the rectangle. The center hole is where you
fit the big socket that goes over the nut. 

When correctly bolted to the rear wheel using the wheel's lugnut, the leverage
of the arm resting on the ground provides a safe and secure means of loosening
and tightening that big nut with a long cheater pipe an appropriate breaker
bar and socket. No more having to worry about having some unwillingly helper
try to hold the brakes while you break loose the nut.

The second use for the device is attaching to a VW or 356 flywheel to tighten
and loosen that big nut. Again it gives you plenty of leverage and makes the
job very very easy and safe.

I don't remember the name of the company that makes the device but I think it
has &quot;Machining&quot; in the title. I'm at work and can't look it up in my magazine
archives. This is a must-have tool for a DIY VW guy. I think it cost around
$30.
