Subject: Re: 72-74 dual carb web page??

[...]

I have the '1973 Emissions Booklet' that came with all VW's in 73. It shows
all models type 1, type 181, type 2, type 3, type 181, 412. They are all
drawings. A little better than Bentley. Page 8 shows bus EGR , page 6 shows
bus air injection.
The 73 bus owners manual only shows a picture of the complete engine thru
the top hatch with the air cleaner on. No help at all......

&gt; The only place it is shown in the 68-79 Bentley is
&gt; in section 3, fuel system. On page 27, section 7.2 barely talks about
&gt; it and
&gt; figure 7-2 has a drawing about it.
&gt; Very poor information.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i agree that is very limited info.  pretty much doesnt help me much at
&gt; all.  does anyone have a bone stock dual carbed bus that would like to
&gt; take some photos and post them to a page?
&gt;
&gt; possibly we could get some with a 72,73 and 74 showing the changes
&gt; made to the dual carb set-up.  they only had it for 3 yrs and there
&gt; are not many un-molested vans/engines out there.  i personally could
&gt; use a good photo gallery of the above mentioned engine compartments.
&gt; anyone else??
