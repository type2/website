Subject: solenoid replacement

I have been lurking the list for quite some time now and some of the
encouragement that you people have given has finally rubbed off.  I am by no
means a mechanic.  Most that I've done is change tires and some spark plugs!
Anyway, I have a 1981 Vanagon (automatic) that has a problem with the
starting motor.  I removed the wires off the terminals etc but noticed that
when I slackened the bolt holding the three &quot;big&quot; wires to the solenoid that
the inside bolt also turned.  Well, unfortunately, I overtightened the
inside bolt and cracked the end of the solenoid.  Then I proceeded to remove
the starter and noticed that there were many major cracks in the solenoid.
When I got it off some small pieces fell from the end of the solenoid.  I
figure that this one is toast.  Oh well, its all a learning experience!

I have another vanagon with a manual transmission and a recently rebuilt
starter (this machine is for parts).  I was wondering if I could take the
solenoid off the &quot;manual&quot; starter and put it on the &quot;automatic&quot; starter.  It
would be appreciated if anyone can give me some info as to how this is done.
I can't afford to spoil another solenoid.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
Keith
