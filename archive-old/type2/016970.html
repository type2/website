&gt; hi everybody,
&gt;         I have an automatic bus which has been converted to a weber
&gt; carb. The bus ides fine but when you try to give it gas it stalls. It
&gt; appears that the accelerator pump isn't doing anything. Can you
&gt; purchase rebuild kits for these carbs. Its just a single carb not dual
&gt; carbs. Its on a 73 1800 type 4 engine. Also where is somewhere i
&gt; can get some more information on thses. I would appreciated any
&gt; advice others can give on this conversion. Will the stock vacum
&gt; dist do fine or will i need to purchase a different kind? Any tuning
&gt; insights?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks

I have the same carb on my '72.  Rebuild kits are available and include a
new accelerator pump diaphragm. Look in VWTrends for any adds with webers
and they'll either have or be able to order the rebuild kit. Haynes
Manuals makes a Weber carburetor book that has the details on this carb.
Some of the carbs out there say &quot;Holley&quot; but are really just the same
Webers that were made for Holley so you could probably even get details on
the carb in a Holley manual.

My '72 either runs very rich, idles high, fails emissions but runs well or
if I try to lean out the idle mixture, it runs poorly (lots of pops and
backfires, could be my ignition?  Maybe incorrect jetting?) but idles
normally and passes emissions.  A vw mechanic I occasionally use claims
these single, 2bbl weber conversions never work well.  He claims I'd be
better sticking to the stock setup than using the single weber.  I bought
the van with the weber so I'm sort of stuck with it.  Does anyone know if
these webers can be set up to run and idle well and pass emissions tests?
I can't imagine emissions for '72 are too strict.  Any opinions on these
Weber 2bbl (DFEV I think)

A final note...I've never had much success in getting a poorly operating
carburetor to work properly by &quot;rebuilding&quot; it.  The &quot;rebuild&quot; kits
normally have gaskets, accelerator diaphragm and float.  Unless the
diaphragm or float is your problem the kit doesn't really do anything.
Carburetors are full of little passages and I think over time they get
clogged.  I've soaked the entire carb in nasty solvents for days, blown
compressed air everywhere I could and still couldn't the things to work
properly.  One time I finally broke down and bought a new carb and I was
back in business.  Am I just unskilled or unlucky, or a carburetors
tempermental things that are difficult to set straight once they are
messed up?
