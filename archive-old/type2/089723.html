Subject: Re: [T2] knocking in the rear end

[...]
Actually on type 1 engines using the stock pulley setup with the little 
disks I have had more than one loose pulley happen.  One I was right at 
the engine and heard the funny metal knock and it still took a while to 
find it.  the pulley was not very loose at all and making a knocking 
noise.

&gt; disappeared. Presumably it had been caused by an out of round, out of
&gt; balance failing pulley.
&gt; Let me hasten to add that I suspect what happened to me was a very rare
&gt; occurrence and not likely to be the source of your knocking.
&gt; The lesson, however, is to consider everything, not just the usual 
&gt; suspects.
