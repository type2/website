&gt; &gt; cranks fine
&gt; &gt; fuel pump runs,
&gt; &gt; gets spark
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cold start valve connected?

never disconected

&gt; Wires to and from the resistor pack connected?

yup

&gt;
&gt; Pull the cold start valve off and crank the bus to see if it's being triggered.

that is one PITA job... even if not working the bus should still &quot;Try&quot; to
start.

&gt; Try fiddling the AFM flap while cranking.

done that.

thanks
Bob
