Today I took the day off to prepare to paint my 72 Westy. I'm cross posting
to both lists because my experience's apply. Awhile back I bought a
&quot;Pneumatic Body File&quot; or in other words instead of using a sanding block and
elbow grease I now can use this. All I can say is that I wish I had bought
one of these way back when I painted my first car. It saves so much work
it's not even funny. I started applying bondo at 11:00 am and have done a
whole side of my bus including a sliding door which had one of those creases
all the way down the side. You know how the large panels on a bus will &quot;oil
can&quot; when you apply pressure when sanding making it hard to feather the
edges and get the middle knocked down at the same time.... piece of cake
with the Air File. If you don't have one of these and want to paint your own
bus I highly recommend one to go along with the DA. By the way I'm using a 5
Hp compressor with a 20 Gallon tank.
I purchased some paint at the local paint shop and I didn't want to spend
100 + per gallon for PPG paint so I bought a gallon of premixed &quot;Signal
Yellow &quot; paint. Now the name defiantly applies here, I asked the nice young
man behind the counter if this was the lightest Yellow he had premixed, he
said 'yes but it's not too bright like say Cor*&amp;^te Yellow&quot; so I bought it.
Get it home pry open the lid and am almost blinded by the stuff! Oh well, at
least the &quot;tailgaters&quot; will see me in time to move over and pass. :^)
