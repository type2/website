&gt;Hi,

&gt;I've got a Ebersacher BN-2 gas heater, but I need a part # for the 
&gt;metering fuel pump for it.  It doesn't appear to be in the manual.
&gt;Also, the name of the manufacturer would be handy.

VW p/n 311 261 467 C  Be prepared for sticker shock.  When I last checked
they were available for the modest sum of $468.

Eberspacher p/n 201395   I had a guy up here who could get them for about
$130.  Haven't talked to him in a while though.  

If you have a broken one, I can talk you through fixing it.
