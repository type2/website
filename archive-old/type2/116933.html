Subject: Door lock spring

I am fixing the front door locks on a 1970 Bus and the type2_dot_com technical
article said I need door lock springs to fix the door locks. Does anyone
know where I can get them, the article lists the part as 211 837 061?

busdepot_dot_com said they could not get them.

Thanks

Jim
