Subject: Distributor Rebuilding

Due to a request by a listee, I have been trying to track down a
specification for the end play of distributor shafts. 

I checked numerous sources and found the following:

&gt;From the Bentley, 63-67 Transporter, Sec E-9, Page 10, &quot;Check correct order
and quantity of steel and fiber washers on the shaft. Compensate for axial
play.&quot; I could find no spec. on the min-max play. Two parts blowups show
dist. with and without vacuum advance. One shows 2 shims and a washer and
the other shows one shim and a washer. The Bosch Distributor kits I get
include a good number of these shims. Adjustment is obviously indicated,
but I cannot find a published spec. My impression is it is not critical,
just shouldn't be sloppy nor so tight it might bind.

Real world measures are as follows from several distributors I have laying
around.

JFR 4, 0231 129 173 005, Porsche 356/912 type, cast iron, low milage
(5000k, stored for many years as owner updated to a complete Mallory racing
ignition), Shaft is like NEW with no wobble.

Drive axial play is 0.050&quot;.

JFUD 4, 0 231 173 005, 021 905 205E, VW vac advance type, aluminum housing,
very sleight shaft wear.

Drive axial play is 0.030&quot;.

JF 4, 0 231 178 009, the common centrifical aluminum VW replacement, very
low milage use.

Drive axial play is 0.007&quot;.

Since I cannot find a spec. in any of the many dozens of 50's on manuals I
checked, I will offer a minimum spec. to prevent bind in all cases.

Heat expansion/contraction of steel is 0.0000058 per degree over/under 68°F
per foot.
Heat expansion of alum. is 0.0000128 per degree.

Say the actual housing is 6&quot;. Max operating temp is 150°. With an aluminum
housing and a steel shaft, the difference in expansion would be 0.003+
inches. It would appear that an allowance of 0.005+ would be adequate to
prevent bind in any concievable normal use and provide space for oil cushion. 

It is also apparent that it is not a critical measurement. And too tight is
much worse than a bit sloppy. Give yourself room to play with that axial play.
