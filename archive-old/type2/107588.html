Subject: Floor jack

I need to buy a floor jack this week. I was wondering what sort of clearance
do I need it to have to get some jackstands in place.  . I have seen some
compact jacks that max at about 15&quot;, some at 20&quot;, or I spend a bunch more
money and it goes up to 30&quot;. Please advise, I need to know how much money I
need to get my wife to part with here. Thanks

Zach
