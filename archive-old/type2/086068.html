Subject: WOW Westy repo racks/it's Friday.

   For those of you that have ordered your Westy rack, they are shipping
today. All I can say is WOW. 
  These are a Beautiful reproduction item and much better then I even
expected. All of the stands are polished, legs are powder coated  and the
wood is very good. I am sure all that purchased will be happy and I am going
to continue to hold the price at $275.00 plus shipping.

ronnie

just for your information there are 2 different Westy rack repo's (imported)
out there now, just make sure you are getting the good one.


ps. I am still running the special on 62-71 t/l  complete assemblies for 35
dollars a pair and the complete
pair of elephant mirrors for 25 dollars a pair
