Well in the past yearand a bit i have put in alot of work on my 74 westy
(new body, interior, and rebuilt engine)


when i picked it up sept 99
it was definately a D (possibly a double D)

but after some blood sweat and tears
and some help from my girlfriend Roberta (painting interior panels, and
masking for body work)
her dad Murray helping me redo the body
and &quot;Aircooled classics&quot; in saskatoon for help with rebuilding (and finding)
an engine

I am proud to say my bus is an A.5 borderline B
and hopefully soon to be a fullfledged A

thanks for givin me sumpin to ramble on about on a snowy cold canadian,
can't drive my bus till the snow is gone, busless Friday

[...]  My 71 Westy is probably closer to (A) than any other of your
choices.  Last year I had a very good paint job done, including removal
of nearly everything prior to painting. The canvas is new, and I've put
in many new interior parts. I need new upholstry in the rear, but the
front seats I have redone.  The sink/icebox is from a 72, so the &quot;wood&quot;
grain does not match.  I have a 71 sink/icebox  which I am restoring.
So, it looks real good, and all the rubber is fresh.  The engine is
stock and has about 50K on it, and the overall machanical condition is
excellent.  It is ready to go anywhere at any time.  It lives outdoors
in my driveway, under cover - but wishes it had an indoor spot.

&gt; hey volks,
&gt; i thought id throw a friday bus poll at everyone.
&gt; something all of you can reply to, even those lurkers
&gt; out there :)  the poll question is:
&gt; What condition is your bus in?   I am just curious as
&gt; to how many out there are driving restored beauties
&gt; down to rusty drivers.  so what kind of bus do you
&gt; drive?
&gt;
&gt; A)Restored Example
&gt;
&gt; B)Very Nice (not quite restored but very clean or
&gt; original nice condition)
&gt;
&gt; C)Daily Driver (clean but has a door ding here and
&gt; there or just a touch of rust)
&gt;
&gt; D)Beater (its rusty, dented, combo of both, people
&gt; look at you funny when they see its not abandoned-well
&gt; maybe not quite that bad:)
&gt;
&gt; reply back to me and ill try and gather the results
&gt; and post back to the list.  so even those out there
&gt; who dont post often, reply back.  ill throw in the
&gt; first vote:
&gt; 1973 Riviera- D an excellent beater example:)
&gt; happy friday
