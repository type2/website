Subject: Engine downgrades?

Is it easy/possible to swap the 1700 in my 73 with a much cheaper and more
common 1600? I'd even be willing to do single carb if it is required. I
searched the archives but didn't see anything about this.

The power difference doesn't bother me, but the price difference between the
two does. Double? There is also a drastic price difference when talking about
parts and such too.

Example from Boston Engine:

1.7-2.0 Long Block Type II &amp; Vanagon 1972-83
2.0 Long Block
$2000 plus
$500 core charge

w/ new heads and upgraded seats and valves
Upgrade: $2500 + core

-----------------------

Dual or Single Port Type I up to 1974 / Type II up to 1971
Air Cooled Long Block
$995 plus
$200 core charg

------------------------

As you can see, it's worth $1000 to me to lose a few HP.
