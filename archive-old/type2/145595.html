&gt; What does everyone use on the valve cover side of
&gt; the gasket. anything at all?&lt;&lt;

I dip my finger in a tub of grease and spread just
enough on the valve cover side of the gasket to make
it &quot;wet&quot;.  I honestly don't know if this helps or not,
but I read somewhere to do it, and I have never had a
leak from the valve cover in my bus.
