Subject: '71 34 PICT 3 carb

Taking advantage of our first nice spring day in No. Cal, I just put a
new carb on my &quot;71 bus, as a timely strike against rough starting/
sputtering/ generally low  low-end power. Top-end power was fine. Things
are much improved, but the carb throat was a sooty/oily mess on the old
carb. Does anyone have an idea where all that crap was coming from?  I'm
running a stock system, incl. air cleaner. The heads, pistons, and
cylinders are all 3 mos. new. P.S. In Marin County the neighbors call
the cops when you're tuning your new carb during the dinner hour on
Saturday.... Thanks, Nathan.
