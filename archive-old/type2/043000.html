Subject: aged CV grease

 Should CV grease replaced due to age? I read in the library that it should 
be done every 50k but my single cab had new CV's installed way back in 1987, 
and have only gone 17 or 18 k since. there is a slight bit of grease seeping 
out at the top, but I was thinking I could just re torque if new grease is 
not needed. Maybe some glycerin on the boots?
thanks, Ronnie
