Subject: Re: Timing Issues

&gt;Again, you don't tune your engine according to what
&gt;distributor is installed, you tune it according to
&gt;your engine model.

Sorry, but the above is absolutely incorrect. The
double vacuum distributors all time retarded at idle,
assuming of course that everything is hooked up and
working. All single vacuum distributors time advanced
at idle. The same goes for 009 and any other
non-vacuum distributor. I set my type I engine at 30
degrees total advance and let the idle advance fall
wherever it wants. This is with a 009. You can do the
same with a single vacuum distributor but it's harder
to do with a double vacuum distributor unless you are
using a chassis dyno to tune with.

Flame suit on:
