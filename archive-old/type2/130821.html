Subject: RE: [T2] Re: mech vrs. elec pumps

dealers are thieves...I hate to say that.. I used to work at one.  Every
different area is a &quot;profit center&quot; and must have markup.

as for pads...
http://www.rockauto_dot_com
'99 CR-V EX
pads front pads. $13.64 non-asbestos, semi-metalic. $0 core charge.
rear shoes... raybestos rear shoe set $12.41 $0 core charge.


I went to my local Honda dealership &amp; they wanted $43 for an air filter for
my Honda 900 cycle.
I went to an independent repair shop &amp; got a filter for $7.


The only thing I would EVER have done at any dealership is warranty work.
Let the dealership rip-off the manufacturer... not me.

try putting new brake pads on a Jetta or Volvo or
any other &quot;newer&quot; car for that matter.. if you want
sticker shock!

$45 for the parts for my '99 CR-V EX AWD through the dealer. I installed
them...

Still, I know what you mean...
