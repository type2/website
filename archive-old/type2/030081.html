&gt; Eric,
&gt; 
&gt; Front end alignments on bay window buses are a bit tricky and getting a
&gt; shop to do it correctly is a PITA :-( The problem is that one of the tie
&gt; rods and the drag link are adjustable and the other tie rod is of fixed
&gt; length. I don't have my bentley here at work, but I am 90% sure the left
&gt; (driver's side) tie rod is fixed, the right (passenger's side) tie rod is
&gt; adjustable.
&gt; 
&gt; The procedure (assuming I have the tie rods correct as to side (HAH! :-))
&gt; is to 
&gt; 
&gt; set the toe of the right front wheel by hand, 
&gt; set the toe of the left front wheel by adjusting the length of the tie rod
&gt;   on that side,

You set toe for both sides at the same time.  You measure it with two
yardsticks between the rims ahead of the spindle and behind the spindle.
the difference in the two readings is the toe-in.  To get it right, you
need to roll the bus to a stop without using the brakes, then chock the
rear wheels while you make your measurements.
 
&gt; pop the drag link out of the pitman arm (comes off the steering box),
&gt; center the steering box,
&gt; level the steering wheel,
&gt; adjust the length of the drag link, and finally 
&gt; reconnct the drag link to the pitman arm.

Or, if you have a steering wheel puller
you can simply remove and reposition the steering wheel.  I don't have the
puller, and if I adjust the drag link to get the steering wheel centered,
the steering box gets to the end of its worm before the wheel reaches its
stop.  For some reason, my wheel is way off and that's one of the things I
haven't fixed yet, lacking a puller.

&gt; Once you have the toe set, you are ready to set the camber :-)

Well, I set the camber first, but check it after I do the toe.

&gt; Look at your ball joints.  One of them will have a huge hex under it.

That would be the top one.  The hex is between the trailing arm and the
spindle.

  Pop
&gt; that ball joint loose from its trailing arm.

I just loosen the nut a quarter turn or so.  As soon as I turn the hex it
frees up nicely.

&gt; *If* the cam comes with the
&gt; ball joint (it usually does), then rotate that with a basin wrench until
&gt; your caster is correct.

You can check the camber with a camber guage, or with a homemade camber
wedge and a level.  The bus must be on a level surface, evenly loaded.
Make sure that the notch in the middle of one of the adjusting hex faces
is pointing somewhere near forward.  If it points backward, it will screw
up your caster, which is non-adjustable.

&gt; re-tighten the ball joint. Do the same on the
&gt; other side.  If the cam sticks in the trailing arm, you need to pop it out
&gt; with a big socket and mallet.  
&gt; 
&gt; Scott Fraser gave thes specs for a 1971 in a post back a bit:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From page 2-35 of the Bentley book
&gt; 
&gt; Wheelbase: 2400mm (94.5in)
&gt; Turning circle: 12.3m (40 ft 4in)
&gt; Track at front: 1395 mm (54 59/64&quot;)
&gt; Total toe with wheels not pressed: +15' +- 15' or 0.0 to 3.3mm (0 to 1/8
&gt; in)
&gt; Total toe with wheels pressed: +5' +- 15'
&gt; Pressure applied to wheels: 15 +- 3 kg (33 +- 6lb)
&gt; Maximum permissible difference between tow with wheels pressed and not
&gt; pressed: 25'
&gt; Front wheel camber in straight-ahead position: +40' +- 20'
&gt;    Maximum permissible difference between sides: 30'
&gt; Toe-out at a 20 degree lock to left and right (wheels not pressed): -2
&gt; degrees 20' +- 30'
&gt; Offset between stub axles: max 0.80mm (1/32 in)
&gt; Caster angle of a wheel: 3 degrees +- 40'
&gt;    equals the camber difference of a wheel on a 20 degree lock to left
&gt; and right: 2 degrees +- 25'
&gt; 
&gt; Final thought:  You really cannot do this correctly without the alignment
&gt; machine!

I do a good job without the machine.  Of course, I also find teaching
kinematics and dynamics to be fun!  :)  If you are careful and find a nice
level
surface to work on you can do a good job with very simple tools.  Of
course, the job is duck soup for the alignment guy.  Some alignment guys
balk at VWs because they have had bad experiences with the link pin front
ends.  The ball joint front ends are worlds easier, but a lot of alignment
guys aren't aware that some of the better VWs came with ball joints.

&gt;  If you have one of those available to you, have at it!  There is
&gt; nothing too hard.  You need a basic wrench set, a basin wrench, a good
&gt; puller to pop the ball joint and drag link off, and a couple cotter pins
&gt; to hold them together when you put them back on.  BUT... you need that
&gt; machine!!! It's like trying to set your CO without a meter.

I get by with a box wrench for the ball joint nut, water pump pliars for
the adjuster, camber alignment wedges, a level, and two yardsticks to
measure toe.  No machine, but the cul-de-sac in front of my house is nice
and level in the center!
