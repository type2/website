Subject: Need Bay Parts near Ohio

Hey All,

I am looking for some bay window parts within a 2 hour drive of Cincinnati, Ohio.  I really need a front windshield, a dash board, interior panels, as well as a few other bits. I will drive up to 2 hours from Cincinnati to pick up or I will pay for shipping from anywhere. Anyone got an old bay carcass laying around??


Peace, John Baker
