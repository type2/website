 I need a little advice. I was on the list but had to get off because of
modem speed problems. I also get charged $10/hr for web time -E-mail is
only $2.50 and can be handled off line at my new reduced speed of 1200bps.
The phone company and the server are the same and are an unregulated
monopoly. Therfore I cannot afford to browsw the archives.
 I am an American living in Belize. I am also a Legal
resident of Belize. If I purchase a Mexican van and have it registered in
my name in Belize would I be able to take it to the US on a vacation. Does
anyone have any info as to the lenght of time I could stay and what
paperwork would be required. The American councilate here has not a clue
and is not interested, it seems, in helping me find out. Any info including
just addresses to write to would be a big help. majortom_at_btl_dot_net

I do have a 72 weatfalia here with a blown 2L engine. Parts and shipping
and lack of talent have kept me from rebuilding.
Thanks for any info
