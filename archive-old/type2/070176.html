&gt; anyone know how many campers they were churning out in the mid 
60's?  

Well actually they were churning out comparitively few campers in 
the early 60's (a la so-23) the advent of the so-42 interior 
coincided with their halting production of their popular Eriba 
Puck trailers, and as such production numbers rose. AS far as raw 
numbers go I think they had only produced a 100,000 campers 
worldwide before 1971. Campers realyy took off in the later 60's 
and then they numbers very quickly rose. Of course w/ the oil 
crisis of the early  to mid 70's numbers slowed down again.
