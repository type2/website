Subject: re: thermostat ?

When the thermostat cable breaks, the cooling flaps mechanism remains in the
open position, allowing cooling air to the engine. If you look under a number
of old buses you'll probably find most of these cables broken or missing. It's
designed to fail in fail-safe mode. The engine will just take longer to warm
up on cold mornings.

Buy the heaviest gauge silvered G guitar string you can find at the music
store. It's the perfect replacement part for the thermostat cable.

how does the thermostat cable connect to the thermostat itself?

I finally figured out what was causing my bus to run so hot. the thermostat
cable is GONE.
