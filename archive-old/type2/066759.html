Subject: re:Where would I go?

I like this question. Living in Little Rock, AR. I would first cut across 
Tennennesse hitting the towns of Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville on the way tovisit my sister Shana at Shaw AFB. Stopping along the way to admire and possiblehike a small portion of the App. Trail. Then turning my soul to the NorthEast
I would cruise the coastline and land my highway boat to pick up my best friend
Eric Pomo and head west to Stockbridge, MA home of Alices Resteraunt (say that
with feeling) Then cruise the Mass. countryside through Springdale (or 
Springfield can't remeber) on the Boston to catch a Pogues concert or hanging
out and catching the local music scene. Oh, I forgot the stop where I pick up 
my friend Eric would be Hartford, Conn. and my sister would be Sumnter, SC. 
After all this I would wearly turn the bus south and head to my surrogate
home of Arkansas.
Peace and a hell of a lot miles to go
