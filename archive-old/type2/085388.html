Subject: Re: [T2] BN 2 heater and a 71 bus

Hi Paul,

I installed a BN-2 into my 72 westy with exactly that configuration back in
1986. It worked beautifully. At the time I had never seen or heard of a
BA-,, but the location seemed to make sense to me.

The air coming out of the heaterboxes in a late bay is pushed by a separate
booster fan from the one used for engine cooling -- very different from how
it is with an upright engine. But since many people have added bilge blowers
to their systems on both models of baywindow buses without incident I
wouldn't worry too much about it. Just think of the BN-2 as a really
complicated bilge blower. I put the heater there and didn't worry about it;
I wasn't getting significant output from the heater boxes anyway.

When the BN-2 is not running you probably won't get much airflow. If the
fuel economy concerns you (at $.40/hr is it really an issue?) then you might
want to wire an auxiliary switch that could power the BN-2 fan without
running the fuel pump or glow plug. Wouldn't be hard to do.

Like VW's  BA-6 configuration I put a metal shroud over the heater to seal
it from the elements and used a small cable routed to the passenger
compartment to remotely operate the reset relay if it was required.


Happy trails,

&gt; Good Day Everybody,
&gt; I have a '71 bus, 1600 dual port engine with doghouse cooling fan setup,
&gt; that I'm going to put a BN 2 heater into.   I'd like the heat to come out of
&gt; the stock defroster and heater vents and still have the original heating
&gt; system for when I don't need all those exta BTUs.
&gt; My first thought was to cut the long, under bus, heat tube and install
&gt; the heater in place of the missing section.  Similar to how the late bay
&gt; window buses have the BN 6 installed.  My concern is that ,when running, the
&gt; gasoline heater would suck more air than usually delived to the heating
&gt; system and there by deprive the engine of cooling air.  A secondary concern
&gt; is that the BN 2 being in the heater tube would block air flow and make the
&gt; original heating system less effective.
&gt; I'd love to hear your opinions, ideas, and real world experiences of
&gt; doing this.
&gt; Alternate ideas gladly accepted too.
