Scott, I see the bus content, but if your website
isn't about them, I can't see the use of putting it on
the list.
We get enough irrelevant advertising on email as it
is, as genuine as your business may.

&gt; I could be convinced to give up my &quot;sunroof&quot; if you
&gt; mean the small poptop

&gt; &gt;Does anyone know of  a sunroof bus being parted
&gt; out?  My bus came to me 
&gt; &gt;with &gt;the sunroof out and it is missing various
&gt; brackets and hardware.&gt;
