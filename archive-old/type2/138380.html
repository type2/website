Subject: Re: [T2] Dual carb synchro tools

This is what I do.  I adjust them to read the same on each carb, then 
put one on each and adjust.  I have problems, anyway, such as they tend 
to fall apart, fall off, have trouble sealing, loose their calibration, 
etc. due to the singular nature of their quality.  I usually do better 
measuring the temperature of the cooling gas and listening, etc.  When 
I had the Dual quite pack muffler set that is made of compressed rust, 
one nice feature was that I could easily distinguish the sound and 
measure the exhaust gas temp from each side, that was also helpful.
