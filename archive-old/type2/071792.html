Matthew,
    I lived in Italy for three and half years. I was in the military and I 
had AFI plates. I had to put Italy insurance on it. If you are not in the 
military or doing Gov't work you will have to put plates from Italy and reg 
it with them. Not sure on that process but check on it deeper it can really 
cost a lot to reg it in Italy and then getting reg back in the states.

Hope this helps

Thanks
Waldo
