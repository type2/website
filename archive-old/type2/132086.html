Subject: Yank fuel injectors for dual carbs? Worth it?

Greetings T29ers, Disclaimer: I9m still a newbie VW driver/mechanic, and I
only know about the stuff I9ve had to repair so far...My buddy claims this
(carb x 2) will help my T2 engine run cooler, give more HP and better
mileage?  I priced some carbs and ouch! Not a cheap or simple operation,
when you add up the costs of carbs, fuel pump etc.  I would enjoy some more
HP as I live in the foothills of the Cascades and I sometimes wonder if I9ll
make it over these passes.  What about rebuilt carbs, they seem more within
my budget?  Why would VW change over to FI if it isn9t as efficient?  Less
pollution maybe?  Thanks for putting up with me.

Cheers, Nik
