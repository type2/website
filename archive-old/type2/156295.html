Subject: Holy crap! Burnt Bus on I-71 in Columbus OH

D'oh, I almost forgot, on the way to Cuyahoga Falls on
Friday we were travelling north on I-71 in Columbus
Ohio and saw a firetruck and stopped traffic up ahead
on the southbound side. When we got up to it we saw
that there was a beige\tan baywindow bus that had been
on fire!! The fire department had already dowsed the
fire out by the time we passed, but it was definitely
burnt 8^0
Was it anybody on these lists?? I really want to make
sure that everyone came out OK???


Peace, John Baker

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
