Subject: IRC chat

Volks,

Every once in a while, I think we ought to remind the lists that one of
the things we have going here at type2_dot_com is an IRC chat server.
Better, it is not running on pon.type2_dot_com, whihc means that during the
recent problem we had with the list machine, the chat server stayed up.

IRC is one of the original 'net applcations, older (I think) even than
e-mail! If you are not old enough to remember how do do this, it has
gotten easier thru the years.

If you have a wintel machine, go to tucows and download mIRC
(http://www.tucows_dot_com/preview/193827.html)

If you have a Mac, download IRCle (http://www.ircle_dot_com/)

If you own/run something else, get in touch.

Install the client, then go to irc.type2_dot_com and join #buslist!

The room is most active from 0100-0300 GMT (7PM-10PM EST, 4PM-7PM PST) at
the moment, but it would be lovely if it turned in to a 24/7 room for
instant advice.  To become that, tho, people need to sign on and hang
around, even when it is quiet. Log into the chat room, then go check you
mail with the room in backgrond... you may be amazed who shows up!
