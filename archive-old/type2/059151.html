I recently bought a '77 Westfalia and have been having a great time getting to know it, cleaning it up and getting it running right.  recap:
'77 Westy with a '79 automatic, fuel-injected engine. Chronology:
Bought bus
Had exhaust fixed
Changed oil
* Rough idle in Park Starting tracking down horn fix Added Fuel Injector Cleaner on full tank of gas
* Strange rhythm started shortly after
Fixed horn
I know that is a little convoluted, but I'd really like to figure out what this is. I have a feeling it's a simple thing that I may have done, or the injector cleaner.

This reminds me of time I poured a can of STP fuel injector cleaner into the tank of my 1972 Squareback in 1983:  The cleaner worked great - in fact it dissolved so much crude, etc in the gas tank and lines that it clogged TWO injectors!  I remember being stuck during troubleshooting because I had a &quot;loping&quot; idle and I would pull off one spark plug wire from the distributor and nothing would happen!  I pulled off another (it just coincidentally happened to be both the plug wires that were connected to the two injectors that were clogged) and nothing changed!  I didn't proceed any further, just dropped the car off at the VW dealers.  Two hundred dollars (injectors = $65 ea plus labor) later I was back on the road.
Hope this helps
