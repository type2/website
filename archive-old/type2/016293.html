Quick and Dirty?  I thought that was a standard ECO :-).
My 75 had that done as well.  If it hadn't been done I
would have had to pull the tank to replace the gasket
10K miles back.  Not fun for sure..

I've found that  sometimes when I put my sender back on
it reads correctly, sometimes it doesn't.  It's in a good
mood lately.  Perhaps I'm just jiggling something right/wrong?

&gt; Unfortunately, this was done the quick and dirty way by cutting
&gt; a hole above the fuel tank to gain access to the sender. Could
&gt; an incorrect sender cause this problem? (such as a 68-73).
