What a great idea! Not only FAR more comfortable, but heated to boot!

An aquaintance bought a new Volvo, after driving the same beetle for 25 
years. She'd go out in the morning and kick on the seat heater, then go 
back inside for 10 minutes. It should help on those cold mornings when 
the heater kicks in just as you're arriving at work.
