&gt;According to Those Who Know, honing cylinders and re-ringing is a Complete

&gt;them round again.  

Who says this?  I have a friend that just did the hone/ring replacement dance and his engine runs like a top.  Great mileage and compression, no oil consumption.

If the cylinders are worn much at all, I wouldn't try and hone them.  People talk about &quot;still seeing the hashmarks&quot; in their high-mileage cylinders as if it was something special, but in my experience only engines that were seriously abused wear through the hash marks and become &quot;oval&quot;.  I have several sets of 2-liter cylinders and they all show the hash marks clearly and uniformly.  I will of course check them for roundness before honing, but if the cylinders are in decent shape, I am convinced that it is okay to reuse them.  YMMV as always.

&gt;Besides, if you've only got 67K on the engine, unless its
&gt;been abused, it probably doesn't need it. 

I agree with you there.
