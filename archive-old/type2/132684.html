Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

I am not a purist, and I do not favor purism. Most of my objections 
have to do with what happens in the aggregate, not what any particular 
person decides to do with their own bus. Some of my specific objections 
to what's looking like the coming trend:

1. The first time there is a lengthy thread on this list about &quot;what's 
the best antifreeze to use in a transporter,&quot; I expect to get pretty 
cranky and annoyed.

2. I'll eventually stop waving at other bus drivers on the road, since 
I don't think a steel shell alone constitutes a bus. I will treat other 
buses as SUVs in drag, unless and until I'm sure that there is no 
radiator, visible or hidden from view.

3. I don't have a Tim Duncan game face, so I dread the day that I walk 
up to someone with just a bus shell in a campground or a 7/11 on the 
road, strike up a conversation, and discover that I am talking to a 
conversion-driver. I won't be able to conceal that &quot;who stepped in dog 
****&quot; look on my face.

I'm not looking forward to any of this. But it looks like it's the way 
things are going to go. It just won't be community any more.
