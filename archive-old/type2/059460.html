Volks, 

Well, the answer to Mr. Dillon's question is that we do allow and even
encourage vendors on the list.  In addition, if anyone discovers a useful
site for parts or tools, by all means post it.  The whole purpose for this
list is to help us keep our busses alive, and parts availability is part
of that mission.  An additional benefit is that the vendors are subject to
criticism.  If they do well, post!  If they do poorly, post!  That way
others who are making decisions (who does the best rebuilt engines?) get
the benefit of the collective wisdom of the list. 

But in addition, it looks like time to repost the charter :-)  Seriously,
read it!  It's important!  Honest! :-)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
