Some don't consider it &quot;nothing.&quot;  It could result in someone losing their
job if someone inadvertantly accesses an inappropriate image at the wrong
time.

&gt; When I don't like a TV show , I just `switch off my TV.

Therein lies the difference.  The type2 list is a technical resource, not
a general entertainment medium.  &quot;Switching off&quot; the type2 list means the
loss of valuable technical content concerning our buses.  There are
plenty of &quot;adult&quot; sites to satisfy those who want that content, so there
is no reason to put it on the type2 list.

Sorry guys, but take the adult content elsewhere.
