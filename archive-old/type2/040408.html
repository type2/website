I have some old dentists drills, they will give them to you if you asak, for
this sort of thing, also jewellers especially the ones who do silver have
tiny dremmels that work real well.

&gt; Regarding prep work for chip touchup. What I have done is
&gt; take a new 1/8&quot; drill bit, and holding it in my fingers spin it
&gt; on the little rust spec just until it goes to shiny metal.
&gt; then dab a bit of primer on it with a small brush, or a
&gt; cotton swab.
