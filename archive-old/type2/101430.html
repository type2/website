&gt; What I'm going to try is to clean up the old plug and use JB Weld to put it
&gt; back in. I'd love to tap out the hole but I just did an overhaul (not two
&gt; weeks ago). I'll fix this right the next time I have the engine apart.

Don't do it. JB is a good solution for many repairs, but it is not the way
to go in this instance. You are taking a big risk if you try to use a quick
fix on this gallery plug. The next time you lose the plug you might be going
fast on the highway and ruin your engine completely from oil starvation.
They usually come out when the motor is cold, though, as the pressure is
highest then.

You need to tap the case and use a tapered threaded pipe plug in the tapped
hole. The correct size plug (ergo tap) is 3/8-18 NPT and the drill needed
for it is 37/64. If you use a shop-vac around the hole while drilling and
tapping, most of the swarf will stay out of the gallery as you go. The plugs
should be available at any decent industrial supply, you want the ones that
have a recessed allen socket. They are readily available in steel or brass,
the brass ones are preferred. While you are at it you can do the other plugs
as well if you are so inclined. There are five of them on the case, I think,
but the ones on the front of the motor (flywheel side) are the ones that
always fall out. If you recently overhauled your motor, chances are you have
higher oil pressure as a result, and that has forced the gallery plug out of
its bore.
