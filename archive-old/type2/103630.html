P.O.?  Parole Officer?  Post Office?

Anyway, from what I understand, you cannot just bring the Mexican Beetles
into the U.S.  Although I know why they are in place, those damned safety
laws are the reason and it frustrates me.  A brand new &quot;old style&quot; mexican
beetle (They call it the Sedan) only cost between $7000 - $8000.  Restoring
one could cost more than that.

BeetleMex  www.btlmex_dot_com is a company that imports them, but I am told that
they find an old bug, restore the pan and attach it to the &quot;new&quot; mexican
vehicle and this allows them to use the oringinal Vehicle Identification
Number.  So you end up with a freshly built Mexican Beetle with a pan from a
classic bug, and on paper, it looks like you own the original - in essence
restoring it.

They are really nice looking and I think worth the $11 large that BeetleMex
charges (pictures are on their website).  But there are a couple part, I
forget what they are, that I was told are almost impossible to find in the
US and a laborer that can work on them is harder still.

I know nothing about bringing buses back.  Plenty floating around this side
of the border, so I don't know why you'd want to.

If you can speak Spanish...

&gt; My P.O. is a grad student heading to mexico for a few months.
&gt;
&gt; He's looking to pick up cheap vw transit, preferably bus, preferably in
mexico to be brought back to the US.
&gt;
&gt; Can it be done?
&gt;
&gt; How?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
