I believe one should seriously consider the effect of posting such a
message on a list of 1000 subscribers could have on a small specialized

Although this list should not infringe upon someone's first amendment
rights,  I believe there should be some policy concerning the use of the
list to post negative comments which surely have a far reaching effect on
someone's livelihood.

Hey, If I were Ron, I'd consider myself an **extremely** fortunate 
merchandiser to have such a unique and efficient forum as this list to keep 
track of customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction.

If I were him, I'd welcome *all* the feedback (positive or negative) here 
he can get.
