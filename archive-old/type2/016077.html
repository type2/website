Hi Matt,

1:  It takes time to somewhat learn hot.  Tin is important, but it isn't the
cause of heat, it just helps shed it :)

2:  There is a piece of tin that goes between the heat exchangers and the
case.  It protects the push rod tubes.  Is this what you are describing?

3:  On the metal fuel lines... it is hit and miss.  One VWFLAPS didn't have
them but two of the ones in my area did.  They are pre-bent (and don't bend
particularly easy).

I have some general engine photos at http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/ that may
be of use.

Subject: cooling tin question


Hey. After a year of searching I finally bought my first bus-
a 1970 hardtop camper. Another listee came to check it out
(thanks Chris!) and showed me where the heat riser tin is gone.
Also the engine compartment seal is in need of replacement.
You might guess that it is running hot. I will be ordering a seal
soon. Does anyone have spare tin for the heat risers?

I was doing the valves yesterday and noticed that I could see
the cooling fins on all of the cylinders from underneath. Is this
right? Am I missing some key cooling tin?

Also, I want to replace the metal fuel line that passes through
the firewall. I can see etch marks where it has been rubbing :^O
Is a pre-bent fuel-line available, or does one have to fabricate
it out of a generic piece? I checked bus depot and could not
find it.

thanks...
