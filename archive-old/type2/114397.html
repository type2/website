Subject: Tires - stirring the pot

.... not really

I think we can agree how much of a pain it can be to find the right
tires for our 14 inch rims.

Does anyone else carry the original look 15 inch rims that Go Westy has?
What a great thing it would be to walk into about any place selling
tires and purchase the 15 inch light truck tires that are so plentiful.

They want $450 for a set of 4. OUCH. Certainly they can't be the only
people on the planet that sell 15 inch original looking rims. Where do
these come from? Did the Brazilian buses go to 15 inch rims?
