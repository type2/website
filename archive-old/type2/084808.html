What is a &quot;bog standard&quot;?

&gt;I recently fitted new heater hoses in the engine compartment the old ones 
&gt;wer missing
&gt;I now have exhaust fumes coming into the van
&gt;Does this mean I have a shot heat exchanger?

Maybe, but I kind'a doubt it.  Bus heat works by sucking air into the 
engine compartment
from those vents up near the roof, in the back--and no where else, since 
ALL of your engine
tin AND seals are present and sealed tightly.  This clean outside air is 
then sucked around
your perfectly clean engine (and engine compartment), into the front of the 
fan housing
(by your perfectly clean fan), through your perfectly clean fan shroud, 
through your brand
spanking new (and perfectly clean) heater hoses, down through your 
perfectly clean heat
exchangers, through your perfectly clean heater pipe, to come out through 
your perfectly
clean vents smelling as fresh as the great outdoors.

If any of the above doesn't sound like your bus, perhaps some maintenance 
is in order.
