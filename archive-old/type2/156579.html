The entire population of type2_dot_com could drive US50 over the next year and
not noticably increase the population.  Despite the name, US50 is far from
the lonliest road in the US.  That honor (for a through road, at
least) probably goes to NV 376, which goes south from US50 at Austin
toward Tonopah.  Remembering that all of the NV376 traffic has to go onto
or off of US50 is it logical to assume that it is pretty devoid of
traffic.
