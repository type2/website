Subject: RE: [T2] REPOST: leaky propane tank safety valve/guage

Mike,

I was over at the local RV super-duper-diesel-pusher palace to look at some
portable stuff. I noticed they have stacks and stacks of catalogs for almost
every propane part for almost every RV made. I bet one of those catalogs has
the replacement part.

Just a thought. Also check GoWesty, they are neck deep in classic camper
restos, although mostly Vanagons...

Jon


Hey Everyone,
I have a 78 Westy with a propane tank.  I have a main valve, safety 
valve thing (w/ pressure gauge), and then the regulator.  The way I turn 
the gas on is by opening the main valve and then press down on the 
safety valve/gauge.  The gauge goes up to whatever level the tank is 
filled to and pressure is held in the system.  I think the safety 
valve's purpose is to ensure that there is not a wide-open leak as that 
will cause the valve to close if pressure is not held in the system.

Recently, however, my safety valve has started leaking around the place 
where it slides in and out whenever I press it down.  I can jostle it 
around and eventually it stops leaking, but I figure it's probably best 
to replace it.

Does anyone know where I can get a new one?

Thanks!
Mike
