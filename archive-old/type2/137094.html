Subject: Wiper Woes

Hi Folks,
I went to pick up an NOS wiper moter from Marcus Schaper in College 
Park, MD.  I got to his house and we tested my motor without the arms 
and it worked!  The problem was that one of the shafts rusted and 
siezed.  I got home and replaced the armature with a spare that I had.  
I tested the motor again by grounding the black from the motor and 
giving power to black/yellow.  I went to hook up using the switch, but 
no go.  Ok  my switch maybe bad.  How do I test this?  There is terminal 
30 (power),  31 (ground to chassis) 31b brown to motor, 53 Black, 53a 
B/Y, 53b B/V how does it work?
