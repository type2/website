Hi All,

sorry I don't have any interesting vw stories to tell, but I am looking for parts to 
rebuild my 36hp for my '57 beetle.  Does anyone know of where I can find a new set of 
pistons/cylinders and bearings (don't know want size I need yet).  Also woulde be very 
interested in in a 36hp judson supercharger kit, complete and rebuildable.

Interesting developments on my '64 Crew Cab:
Had a '71 power brake booster installed!  (mucho fabrication)
Installed lowered bus spindles
New 1731 DP motor.
