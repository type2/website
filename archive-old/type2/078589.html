That could be a ton of welding!  A wire welder would not be a good choice
for this?

Bryan &quot;bc&quot; Castles sends:

&gt; What did you do about the really pitted parts, or did you have any?   I
&gt; can't see just grinding them all down because the sheet metal would get
&gt; flattened. So is this a smart use for Body Filler?  How about for the pits
&gt; left after a patch seam?   How do those folks that do &quot;all steel&quot; work
deal
&gt; with this?  My guess is replace the panel, is it right?

I wire brush the pits to clean them out, then fill them in with oxyacetylene
and MIG wire.
