&gt; Ugh, I think I've finally reached the end of my VW odyssey.  Last year I 
&gt; had to replace my heads (twice) after a failure of the #3 exhaust valve, 
&gt; then after a failure of the refurb heads.  Now, after things have been 
&gt; going well for a little over a year, trouble is back.  It started with some 
&gt; noises, lound put-putting on a normally whisper quiet engine.  A 
&gt; compression test showed that #3 is down to about 80 psi, while the other 
&gt; cylinders are all around 110-115.  A squirt of oil didn't do anything.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm basically screwed, right?  Rebuild time again?  How long can I keep my 
&gt; bus on the road as is?  Should I just mothball the bus for now until I can 
&gt; sell it in the spring?  Am I basically rolling the dice every time I try to 
&gt; drive it? We'd don't need to use it much, but we do use it.  Still, I'm 
&gt; worried with winter coming on...

A lot of your success will be determined by your outlook. If you get
to the point that you perceive the bus as a burden instead of a good
reliable form of transportation you might as well give in, but I
encourage you to work though this problem and enjoy the bus more.

Like don suggested check the valve to make sure it hasn't gotten
tight, although w/ a 79 you should have hydraulic valves. I'd start to
kinda wonder what might have caused this anyway. What did the spark
plugs look like? Is #3 running lean. I squirt of oil will usually only
overcome badly worn rings, not a valve that is trashed. If #3 is the
one that keeps going south that is an indicator that something is
amiss there. My blind guesses would be a fuel injector that is
somewhat clogged, or perhaps a lifter that isn't operating correctly.
