Subject: Re: [T2] whomp whomp...

actually...i did also replace the steering dampener.

the tires are yokohama 356 185R14 load D's...with only
400 miles on them.

like i said, they only put a balancing weight on the
inside and not on the outside, eventhough the other
ones have weights on the outside.

i'll put the wheel off in the morning and check the
cotter pin.  the noise is loud enough to worry me that
its more than that.

missy:)
