I have a 68 Westy, and we are trying to replace the ball joints.  No matter what those suckers won't budge!  I have the book for idiots, and it says that they take a little conv., but they do come out.  We have hammered, and hammered, and even thried to blow-tourch the metal to make it give, but no luck.  Does anyone have a clue how to get these off?  There has got to be a trick to it that I am just not seeing.
