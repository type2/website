Subject: Checking elec. shorts, part II.

Ok, 

I took the advice of a couple fellow members and disconected the battery  
ground strap and ran a wire lead from the battery - post and one from the 
body of the van. I hooked the bulb out of my dome light inbetween the two 
wires, and there was a short, small spark, but no light.. I measured the 
battery, and it came up at 12 volts, so it should be fine.

Does this mean that I don't have a short? Thanks for the help in advance.

Chris
