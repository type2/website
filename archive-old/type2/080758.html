He's speaking about the &quot;flapper&quot; in the AFM.  In my experience, putting the
pedal to the floor on a Volkswagen when starting only helps when the mixture
is too rich since it introduces much more air into the engine which helps
burn the excess fuel.

&gt; Not sure what you're saying. The connector is two prong on my '79
california: 1. signal from the brain(?) and  2. the ground at the c.s.
injector. Mine is still well sheathed so I can't see if there's two wires
connected to one pin. Is this what you're asking?

The cold start system is completely independent of the ECU.  If the
thermo-time switch senses that it's cold enough it allows current to flow to
the cold start valve when the key is in the &quot;start&quot; position, opening up the
valve and giving the engine that extra &quot;squirt&quot; of fuel it needs on startup.
