Subject: Camshaft question

What is the difference between a camshafts. . .

	113 109 021D
 
	113 109 021G

The 'D' version is indicated for buses 60-71 but if my bus has a 1600DP
(same engine as later beetles) what would be the benefits or drawbacks of
one over the other?

I'm doing a rebuild and any advice is appreciated.
