Subject: RE: [T2] Rw: Windshield

I myself feel that steel is better, but I have some of the por 15 epoxy
putty to seal up around the windshield for the winter. I will grind this off
in the spring and start the welding process. Mine is not very bad, just
enough to start showing below the rubber. Probably worse when I get into it.
The repair panels for the outside edge and the entire front are available if
you order from the UK. This is much easier for us folks on the east coast.
Donor busses are few and far between around here. I would hate to cut up a
bus that had the windshield area in good shape. I would rather try to save
the entire bus, unless it is completely a lost cause. If this is the case,
then the windshield area is usually not that good.

Due to this thought process of trying to save busses, I am starting to
accumulate several busses. I can see this being a problem in the future :)

My main bus has this rust around the window, but the rest of the bus is
almost rust free. I have gone over fairly well and found only a few spots of
rust. Some under the battery. I was very surprised. This bus came from
Arizona, so some west coast busses have the same windshield rust.

I do agree on the point of not putting a ton of money in a bus that probably
has rust in other places. I just happen to have one that does not have much
at all, just the windshield.
