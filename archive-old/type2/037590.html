Subject: Looking for Transmission

I am looking to put a '76 - 79' transmission in my 72' (it has a 2 liter).
I've been looking at rebuilds, but when by switching transmission style no
one will take my '72 as a core and makes this whole deal cost prohibitive.
So anyhow I am settling for a used one.

1) Does anyone have '76 - '79 transmission to sell or trade?

2) How do you test a transmission that is not in the bus?

TIA
