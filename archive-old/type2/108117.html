Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L Rebuild saga

These sort of questions are impossible to answer in the abstract.  You need
to know a lot of facts about the individual asking the question.

How much money do you have?

Do you have a workshop where you can work on this thing?

Do you have a lot of tools, and experience working with them, particularly
the measuring tools needed for a &quot;good&quot; rebuild?

Do you have another ride?

Is this vehicle a daily driver or a hobby?

Do you get some sort of psychic reward from rebuilding engines?

And, etc., etc. etc.?

Do all the permutations on the questions above, particularly the &quot;etc.,
etc., etc.&quot; and you presented a question that's impossible to answer.

That said, the common wisdom about GEX is that they are pretty poorly built
throughout and you'll only get a reasonable amount of mileage out of then if
you're unreasonably lucky.

So, if you have a lot of money, a lot of time, another ride and really,
really want to build a good engine, tear that thing down to its smallest
component and start over.

If you have a reasonable amount of money but less time or need to get on the
road fairly quickly, then use this engine as a core for a quality rebuild.

Here's the bottom line:  You can build an engine that's *better* than the
&quot;volume/reasonable quality&quot; rebuilders, but you *can't* build it cheaper
than they can.

These are tough questions to deal with.

Subject: [T2] 2.0L Rebuild saga


&gt; ok volks here is the story...
&gt;
&gt; i bought a 74 westy with a 2.0L single carb'd GEX rebuild with only a few
&gt; thousand miles on it. when i bought it cylinders 1, 2, &amp; 4 were firing
&gt; around 120 but my #3 cylinder was losing alot of compression. upon tearing
&gt; the engine apart i have found that the head gasket is cracked/broken which
&gt; deffinitely could bethe culprit. my question is this...
&gt;
&gt; i know gex rebuilds are shotty so should I:
&gt;
&gt; a)replace the gasket &amp; slap the motor back together hoping that the
&gt; compression problem will be fixed
&gt;
&gt; b)have the lower end checked out
&gt;
&gt; c)have the upper end inspected and possibly rebuild the entire top end to
&gt; fix the low quality GEX heads
&gt;
&gt; this is my first vw so i want to fix things right the first time. however,
&gt; the bus has been parked in the garage for over 6 months as i try and
&gt; acquaint my self with the motor. i would like to get it on the road as
&gt; soon as possible but dont want be forced to drop the motor again in
&gt; another 5,000 miles. how far should i be going with this overhaul
&gt; considering the passenger side head looks brand new?
&gt; sorry about the lengthy mail, ANY advice would be greatly appreciated.
