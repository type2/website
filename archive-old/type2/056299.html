Subject: Re: - where did this engine come from

&gt;hi chaps (and ladies of course), 
&gt;i pulled the motor on my 72 westy today for a little oil seal work and 
maybe
&gt;bearing replacement to find, whats this, i have the wrong motor. it 
should
&gt;have been a 72 'cb' 1700. instead it turns out to be a 76 and on ge 
(2000)
&gt;motor. no wonder it ran so well. some po had put all the original tin 
back on
&gt;and i got the engine number from that. then i noticed the different 
number
&gt;stamped in the case.  

This is an excellent point.  You will find that the Bus engines have the 
engine number stamped on the fan housing.  Well, the fan housing can be 
interchanged among various Type 4 engines, so that is not really a good 
indicator of the actual engine code.  You can also find the engine code 
stamped in the crankcase, between the breather box and the fan housing.  
This is a more reliable place to read the engine number, but be aware 
that lots of folks switch to 2.0L engines and hydraulic lifters when 
rebuild time comes for that old 1700 or 1800.
