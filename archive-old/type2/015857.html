My 1980 air-cooled vanagon has excessive (1 quart in 500 miles) oil 
leak.  I have removed the cooling tin from the bottom of the motor and 
after wiping down the drips and running in place for 30 minutes, it 
appears that the oil is leaking from the push rod tubes and possibly the 
head gasket itself.  Is it possible for the head to be leaking oil or 
did oil collect in that area from the leaking push rod?  That area is 
the steel tin below the heads.

I live in Vero Beach, Fla. and also own and drive daily a 1970 single cab
pickup.
