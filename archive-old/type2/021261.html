at 
250 or even 270 degrees if there is decent pressure behind it.  That
said, 
I still slow down when I get over 240 degrees, just for a margin of 
safety  - YMMV.
I'd question that remark if one uses multiweight oil- any research out
there on the effects of temperature in the viscosity handling of these? 
I know they revert to the lower viscosity when they fail, but under what
conditions will this occur? I use 30 or 40 wt straight.
   So you seem to agree with me that if the pressure is there, the temp
is not as critical.  I had a bit of a scare yesterday, thinking the  now
225K unrebuilt engine was protesting....it was like 78 degr out and I
had to do an hour's drive in a bit of a hurry (65-70 mph speed)-
The temp went up rather high (264, oil pressure still around 18-20, )
and I backed it down to 60 and it dropped.  Did get the VDO controlled
light flickering at idle when I arrived, but I understand it does so
around 10 psi compared to thre stock 3-5??  I had to run after that to a
community band rehearsal and getting out after dark, heard wierd
clicking noises back there when I stopped at the first light and any
time I had to reduce to idle.....checked that I had the Good Sam
Emergency Road service card, and drove home- sounded ok at speed
though.  Got home, shone a light back there and discovered the
alternator adjustment cover had popped off and was stuck (shredded)
between the fan cover screen and the fan!  Might explain the higher that
usual temps I got also.
