    Yesterday we experienced the dreaded engine fire in our 71 westie. 
Fortunately, we live in a small town and the response from the fire
department was incredibly quick.  Amazingly, all that was really damaged was
the hoses, wiring harness, and assorted plastic/rubber parts.
    Granted, I was probably careless in inspecting the fuel lines, and
granted I was also unlucky- but beware it does happen- it can also happen to
you.
    I guarantee that when it goes back on the road that there will be
braided fuel line on it, particularily where the line passes through the
metal.  Please don't let this happen to you!  It is simple to prevent-I
didn't and I got bit (thankfully there were no injuries)
    One last item-anybody got an extra wiring harness they want to sell?
Paul
