Subject: Hydraulic lifters for 1.8L

Grupp, I have been researching hydraulic lifters and prices to get them here,
(Canada), and I have been made aware of two types, one has a &quot;wire&quot; snap ring
holding the lifter together, and the other one is like the Febi lifter with
installed steel snap ring to hold all together.  Has anyone on the list had
experience with the first mentioned type versus the second mentioned type?
Price seems to be a big factor between, but that cannot always be a barometer
of quality. Thanks
Sid
