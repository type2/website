Subject: key broke in ignition removal update

Ok, so I've reead the Bently procedure a couple times and step 11 says to 
insert the key into the ignition lock and unlock the steering column. I 
can't do that. that is why i'm taking it apart in the first place. Can I 
just skip this step. Is there an alternative?
Thanks,
Kyle
