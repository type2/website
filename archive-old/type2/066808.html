Subject: Re: Bilge blowers

&gt;Gonna order me a bilge blower from West Marine, too. Can't decide
&gt;whether to go with the Atwood or the PAR. Guess I'll flip a coin.

I cant remember which is which, but one of those guys make
two versions of the same blower: Regular and Salt Water
models. For like $2 more, get the salt water one.

BTW, I am also going to make this mod some time soon.
I am going to try building a system with louvered ventilators
in the rear area next to the spare tire, a merged 'Y' pipe
with both the engine and electrical fans feeding
the heat exchangers, and a boost blower up front.
I will prob start with the front blower, just to get some
defrostability. I dont need heat, but I do need volume. 
I dont like to PULL air in a heat exchanger setup, though.

BTW, are you going to switch the power or use a variable 
resistor. Those fans are LOUD at full speed.

Get back to us on your trials and tribulations.
