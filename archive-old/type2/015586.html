The key to dealer parts is finding a parts man/woman/other that knows what
it's like to not be able to get a needed part, and understands with
millions of old VW's still registered there is a viable market, but if the
only time you call them is when the part is not available at a discount
from others, they get the idea that every $20 worth of parts you order
requires 20 minutes or more of time and effort to find and order, well the
economics gets out of wack. When you find someone who will pursue and
deliver these parts, consider ordering more from them. It may cost a little
more but such service is worth it's weight in gold and can nip these nasty
parts problems in the bud.

If you ever need Datsun/Nissan parts, my brother is a wholesale parts man
with an attitude at Wendle North Town in Spokane. He's a VW nut himself,
but will probably bend over backwards to find you what you need to keep an
old Z car or 510 in good order. He may have 20 years Datsun/Nissan dealer
parts experience by now.

A good buddy of his is Paul. He handles parts at the Audi dealer in the
Valley, Appleway Motors. They cover a whole bunch of marks. Paul is deep in
VW/Audi knowledge. He has a brand new 67 T-I. All the spezial factory
hardware everywhere. All black. Impossible to take a picture of it.
Absolutely correct restoration throughout by someone with access to all the
factory info and parts. He has an early 4000S Quatro for a daily driver. He
will help all he can if your having problems finding what you need to
finish a proper fix with the right part for your VW/Audi. 

Tell them Doktor Tim sent you.

&gt;While at my local VW dealer today looking up Vanagon parts, I realized
&gt;the parts man was answering EMAIL! It seems they sell F*rd and other
&gt;parts by email.
&gt;The parts man there is Marshall and he said he'd be happy to give type 2
&gt;list members 10% discount. He's pretty eager and
&gt;persistant in finding parts if they are in the system.
