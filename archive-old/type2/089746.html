Subject: newbie repairing totaled bus

Hi,

My '78 Campmobile is totaled according to our insurance company.  I took it 
to the frame and axel place in town.  He said the driver's side rear arm, 
spring plate, and probably the spindle are bent.  He recommended I try to 
pull the whole unit of a junkyard bus (if I can find one). Here's my 
questions:
1. What year busses would have these units that would work in a '78?
2. Are regular bus and westy bus rear ends the same?
3. Is this a job a beginner should tackle?
4. What years rear bumpers would work for my '78?
I really would like to resurect this bus.  Although we only had it for a 
year, we had some great times in it, and it's a great runner.  I'll worry 
about the body and interior damage later but would like to get it up to 
passing our state (Washington) state patrol inspection in order to get our 
title back.

Please help,
Jacques in Yakima
