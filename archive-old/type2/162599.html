Subject: Re: [T2] *#&amp;$_at_(!! glass.

I've done this before it is not that hard, have nice piece of side window
glass (one piece) and brand new rubber from BD but can't get the rubber to
stay on the glass while I get it into the opening, have string for that
part in the other slot but haven't even gotten that far.  have tape
holding it on tight but can't put it in the hole with the tape on it.
mumble mumble mumble.  anyone got any secret incantations???

I swear I don't remember it being this hard before...

Bob
