Good grief. If you had not have posted the shot of the bottom I might have
wondered if the seal was inside out.

Volks, does it matter if the seam of the seal goes at the bottom? You
wouldn't think so.

&gt; I think it's clear from the photos that the metal underneath is
&gt; basically OK (there is a little rust in there, but it appears to be
&gt; minor).  I think you're right, that the glass is short.  There's quite
&gt; a gap to load up with silicone :-)

The bottom of the windshield rusts from the inside out, not the other way
around. By the time a tiny bits of rust appears there's a lot of cancer
under there. Even with no visible sign it's usually pretty bad as you find
out when you replace the windshield. For example...

Any early silicone repair:
