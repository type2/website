&gt;Is there any reason I cannot put a Bug muffler on my Bus?  I've

&gt;for trouble by using a Bug muffler?  Opinions?
&gt;Thanks!

I believe the beetle (2-tip) muffler is not recommended for the bus in that 
the exhaust is directly behind the bus, creating a vortex of noxious fumes 
that remains with the (back of the) bus whilst moving.  The bus tailpipe may 
solve this by discharging the exhaust a little closer to the so-called 
slipstream.  It does seem (also according to Muir) that this causes a little 
more back-pressure than the beetle muffler.  Is this good or bad?  Dunno - 
can't say.  An alternative may be the use of the &quot;zoom tube&quot; tailpipe that 
fits the beetle muffler.
