Hi,

 This is true.

&gt; Drive behind a semi, you will still get tossed right, left, right,
left,
&gt; right....

 Well, buffetted a little, anyway. IMHO &quot;tossed&quot; is a bit strong.

&gt; Well you get the idea.  Drive though a mountain pass where the
predominant
&gt; wind is perpendicular to the pass and you can do a 2 lane, lane
change before
&gt; you can correct. 

 Again, I'd say this was exaggerated. A gusty crosswind will punt you
off your line but, in my experience, not by that much.

&gt;  Improving the &quot;antisway bars&quot; might help a little bit but they
&gt; improve body roll in corners more than the transient 
&gt; oscillations set up on a windy day (short period actually I guess.)

 If you're actually &quot;oscillating&quot; then your shocks are knackered :-)

 Good shocks and stiff anti-roll bars do help to alleviate the effects
of
gusts. The amount of body roll caused by the wind is reduced and with it
the &quot;whiteknuckle&quot; factor and the amount of lateral movement.

&gt;  Live with it or
&gt; drive a nice modern minivan with some semblance of aerodynamics. 
Note that
&gt; upgrading to a Vanagon does not help, a box on wheels isn't better
than a
&gt; breadloaf on wheels ...

 I disagree here. The different front suspension and higher weight of
a &quot;vanagon&quot; help quite a bit, IMHO. They don't eliminate the problem,
of course, since as John says any type two is basically a box on wheels,
but they do improve things.

&gt; So everyone don't go tracing down a pile of nothings hoping to
drastically
&gt;  improve the feel of the bus, #1 tires inflated properly (even with
bad
&gt; tires), #2 proper tires, if that don't help and nothing obviously is
loose
&gt; in front, you got what you got.

 Can't argue with this. You can get some incremental improvements by
uprating
shocks, anti-roll bars, tyres, spoilers, suspension etc. but the cost
will
be a worse ride and lower ground clearance and the benefits will be
constrained by the nature of the beast.

 Finally, to come back to the weight thing, a busses sensitivity to
crosswinds depends on it's load: empty is bad, loaded is better. If you
have to make a trip in a gale you might want to consider loading a few
bags of sand, blocks of cement, fat friends or whatever into the back
before setting off. It'll make quite a difference to your directional
stability (though obviously you'll go up hills slower, too!!).

Cheers,
	W.
