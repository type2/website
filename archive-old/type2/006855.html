Shortly after buying a new battery, I jump in the van to go to work. No
ignition lights. I go round the back and find the engine bay open and my new
battery has been CUT OUT. the police were actually interested and would have
taken fingerprints if I could drive the van up to the police station and
please try not to touch anything.
I now have a padlock through the engine bay button - it looks like it's
wearing a nose-ring. Authenticity is never worth that grief again.
