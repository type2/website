Subject: Fwd:  '70 Vs '77 Drivability impressions

Hi John,

You write:
 
... you have to rev it ['77] very high inorder to keep it from bogging
down in
the next gear. Also a very bouncy ride (with new shocks). The gas pedal
is
hard to push (well lubed and adjusted).

My question, is my perception reality or could my '77 be poorly
maintained.
+---

 There's something wrong with the '77. The 2l engine should have loads
of
bottom end torque: mine pulls like a train from low revs.
 VW only upped the top end power by about 20bhp (to 70), in favour of a
flat torque curve: compare to a Porsche 914 engine with 100bhp from what
is essentially the same engine, but tuned for a light fast car instead
of
a heavy slow van.

Cheers,
	W.
