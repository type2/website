Subject: Re: [T2] why a stumble?

Volks,
More on the stumble 78 FI 2.0L all stock. Thanks for all  the input, and here is
what I have learned.

I took some more readings of distributor advance. 28 degrees at 2500 and 35
degrees at 3500. I had not previously taken a reading at 3500 RPM. This seems to
be within spec per bentley. The vacuum advance is functioning and adds 15 degrees
at 2500 RPM. The advance does jump around given a steady RPM and the idle jumping
around correlates with the advance jumping. I think I can assume the bearings on
the dizzy are worn. Rebuilt stock dizzys are available from a few sources at
around $110 plus tax/shipping. I may go this route when I have $100 to spare. I
put an exhaust sniffer on the bus today. CO was at 3.5, so I adjusted it to 1.7.
Bentley says to go to 1.0 for my year but a little higher on earlier years. Any
thoughts? The good news is that the stumble is much improved since the adjustment.
Could the stumble have been due to a rich running mixture?

Thanks again!
Regards
Chris
