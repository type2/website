Subject: Re: Beware MSHP (was: 2L head source)

Ahh, come on, they have to pay for those multicolor full page national
magazine ads somehow. Lure them in with 'decent' prices suggested, get the
core charge up front, then identify them like all other cores, not perfect.
Could be also that the proper welding of a cracked core costs as much as
the core value. If done properly, it probably does.

&gt;&gt;But be aware that even Marc Stephens isn't perfect. David Schwarze and I
&gt;&gt;have both gotten unsatisfactory heads from MSHP. Inspect thoroughly!
&gt;
&gt;I too got two bad heads from them.
&gt;And, as I do not tire to point out, MSHP will routinely cheat you out of
your core
&gt;charge.
&gt;They do this with such impertinence and efficiency that it is disgusting.
&gt;They still owe me $200 and I still get mad just thinking of them.
