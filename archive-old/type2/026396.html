Also sprach Steve:

&gt; *You* need to supply the labor, or your bus wil eat you out of house
&lt;schnipp&gt;
&gt; minivan costs at least $20K, and you cannot spend that much for a VW, 
&gt; even if you try!

To which I'd like to add the obvious remark that your time is costly as
well. So whether owning a bus (or any other old car) makes sense depends on
who you are and how you value your time. The question you want to ask
yourself is what else would you do if you didn't have to work on the bus.
Play with the kids, bill a few more clients at $150 an hour, finish your
dissertation and join the work force a year earlier than anticipated, do
community service, drink beer with friends, drink Bourbon by yourself, watch
TV and be depressed? 

Compare the value of your time to the cost of having a professional do the
job. 

Or it may well be that bus work (and I mean work effort, not its result)
makes you happy. Then by all means, find an old rust bucket and bring it
back to life!

In my earlier incarnation as a graduate student, I used to be low on cash,
but had (or made) plenty of free time; thus owning an old car (the bus) made
sense. It also provided me with a source of quasi-instant gratification:
fixing a mechanical problem only took days or even hours. Writing a
dissertation, on the other hand, took years and years without end in sight.
Now I get a real paycheck and I like to spend time with my kids. If it
weren't for nostalgia, I would have sold the veedubs by now. (Their primary
purpose, alas, is no longer transportation, but mere weekend drives. I'm
afraid they no longer justify themselves as a necessity, but rather as a
luxury and expensive hobby. But that's a different issue...)

My point: yes, unless it's a labor of love, you can and will spend over $20K
on a bus. Just acknowledge the value of your time and do the math.
