&gt; 1) what tools am i going to need for the bearing
&gt; install? i am thinking just a punch &amp; hammer, but is there
&gt; anything else?

Use a punch to remove the races.

For installation I prefer Lisle tool 12600 because it makes it easy to get
them in straight the first time and the chance of damage to the hub is
minimzied. Find it at Pep Boys and Sears.

Note: it's not metric but it nicely fits VW/Porsche bearings.
 
&gt; 2) i was planning on ordering the rotors from Bus Depot. does
&gt; anyone know if those come with the bearing outer race
&gt; pre-installed, or will i have to do that?

The hub separates from the rotor, so no.

Remove all the old grease from the hub, pack the bearings and reinstall
them. I packed them by hand but you can one of two devices to help you.

One attaches to a grease gun and the other is a hand tool. Both use the same
cone design to force the grease in. See 34550...

http://www.lislecorp_dot_com/tools/newtools/index.htm

And 65250...

If you are on a budget I would just get the bearing and race kit because it
makes the job so easy.

&gt; oh yeah, one more thing - can anyone point me to a good article
&gt; in the library regarding adjusting a clutch? (don't have my Bentley
&gt; handy)

Cable adjustment or do you have the engine separated?
