I found my leak to be coming from an injector. I belive that it was either
the seal or the hose on the injector.  Either way the hose was cracked
maybe from me twisting it off the line.  I almost bought a repro injector
but decided to wait till mon. to get a bosch.  Should a seal come with
this?  The repro one did not really have one.
