&gt; Friends on the Net,
&gt; I ran into a very pecular item yesterday. I believe that we home
&gt; mechanics are really being decieved by some air compressor dealers. I
&gt; bought a 3 H.P. Sears Oiless Air Compressor which is really a dog, buty
&gt; when I started checking it and other compressors out I found that the
&gt; ones that are Advertized as 3 H.P. are actually 2 H.P. I looked at the
&gt; compressor motor and it is rated at 15 Amps at 120VAC. One Horse Power
&gt; in all textbooks is rated at 746 Watts.

WADR I think you may have misread the name plate. I feel this way because in
the US all electric equipment must meet the National Electric Code. According
to the code a  3 hp motor at 115 VAC should draw around 34 amps. At 230 VAC
the same hp draws 17 amps. That's why the largest home units are around 3 hp.
Most house wiring in the US is 12 gage and is sized for 20 amps. Size also
makes for a limiting factor, larger size motors need higher voltages (480
VAC). Because the motor is considered to be in a non continuous  operation,
the rating is allowed to be increased to 125% of the same motors rating if
used continuously. Sears claim as to hp is in all likelyhood correct.

Looks like your experience with your compressor has been a bummer.
