Hi all,
We've let this thread go on because so far it has to a certain extent
provided us with some good info on a list favorite vendor, both good and
bad.  Ron knew when he started Bus Depot up that he could use the list to
occasionally advertise and post specials but he also knew that he'd have to
put up with the negative posts about his business as well.

I didn't want to jump in earlier because by and large that's what was going
on, with people sharing their positive and negative experiences with the
Depot.

Once the thread turns into a personal attack session then it has outlived
its usefulness and will NOT be tolerated on this list.  If listmembers want
to get in a pissing match then DO IT ON YOUR OWN TIME.

To reiterate the admin position on Bus Depot, we have no problem with people
airing their bad experiences with Bus Depot.  That's part of the deal Ron
signed up for.  However, it is good form on the part of the customer to USE
ANY AND ALL MEANS POSSIBLE to resolve a customer service issue with Bus
Depot itself before posting to the list about it.  It's certainly not fair
to Ron to post to the list that the parts you ordered haven't gotten here in
2 weeks and Bus Depot sucks blah blah blah when you haven't even called them
(and not the order line) to find out what's up.

Anytime I've had a question about an order I've always found Jerry de Baun
to be very helpful in resolving it.  He can be reached via e-mail if you
don't want to spring for the phone call at jerryd_at_ziplink_dot_net.  He's never
failed to respond to a question I've sent him regarding an order.

If you guys want to post about Bus Depot I'm not going to kill the thread.
But you WILL keep it totally to the facts and you WILL call or e-mail the
Depot to resolve the issue before you post.  You also WILL NOT post personal
attacks to the list.

This post may seem biased toward Bus Depot but consider I've never seen a
post from Ron saying &quot;boy this customer really sucks, he never pays on time
and he always changes the order at the last minute.&quot;

Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.
