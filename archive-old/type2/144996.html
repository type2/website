Subject: Main Wiring Harness

Hey guys,

      A few months ago, I attempted to order a &quot;Main Wiring Loom&quot; for my 1973 VW Bus. I ordered the wiring loom for a 1972 since that was the last year that JBugs had them for. Unfortunately, immediately after my order I got a call and they told me they no longer sold them.

They do still have listed a wiring harness for a 1970/1971 VW Bus. Can anyone tell me what significant differences there are between the 1972 and the 1970-1971 harness?

My Bus is VERY basic. The only option that I have (that I know of) is rear defog. 

I don't mind modifying the harness slightly if I need to, but it seems to me, if I can use this harness, I would prefer to. 


If anyone knows anything about the 1970-1971 harness and what if any differences exist that would prevent me from being able to use it in my 1973, I would appreciate it.



Thanks!

Todd
