Subject: New Popout Window Rubber problem

Just put new rubber on one of my popout windows
and now I can barely open it.  Should I put some
kind of lubricant on the rubber so that it slides
more easily, or will this pass with time?

BTW, this is actually not brand new rubber, I
bought it from FLVW dealer in 1976, but never got
it installed on the bus I had back then.  Stuff
has been with me longer than probably anything
else.  Back then, the parts counter guy was really
helpful.  He loved my blue &amp; white '65 California
plated Kombi in Connecticut.  Every payday in the
Navy, I'd go down there and buy something for my
bus.  The only things that had been obseleted back
then were parts for the fresh air overhead vent.
Ah, those were the days.

peace,
terry &amp; Sunshine ('64 Westy)
