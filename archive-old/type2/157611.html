&gt; Wasn't there some thought that if you bent the tubes (brake lines) while
&gt; they were inside a SPRING, this would prevent them from crimping????

That only works if you also have the crimping tool to put the crimped ends
on the tube.  You have to have one free end from which to remove the
spring.
