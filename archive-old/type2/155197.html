Subject: Parts on order

Hi All, 

Finally saved up enough cash to order the parts necessary to get my bus
motor put back together.  Small fortune in parts, but I decided to
replace a fair amount of stuff so that I won't have to pull the motor
back out and do it again anytime soon.  

Tinwork is almost all sandblasted and painted, just a few odds and ends
left.  

Questions - 

  Which side of the engine-tin/body seal faces upwards?

  What's the best method of blocking off the heater duct holes in the
tinwork (PO removed all the heating stuff) without resorting to drilling
holes or using aluminum tape?  Would pieces of that high-temp silicon
used for setting pots and pans on work? 

  Where can I find the spacer that sits behind the fan (t4, 2L FI) to
replace the AC pulley?  the pulley rattles like mad and I hate rattles.
If I can't find one, can I turn down an aluminum spacer the same
thickness as the pulley?

  Is it a Good Idea or a Bad Idea to slot the cylinder head right by #3
spark plug hole so I don't bugger up the VDO CHT thermocouple when
removing the plug?  Do I have to remove the crush washer from #3 plug if
I'm using the thermocouple underneath the plug? (heads aren't installed
yet)

  Where does the vacuum line for the SVDA hook up on a stock '77 2L FI
bus?  The 009 is going in the spare parts bucket.  I plan to hit
Ratwell's site, but I thought I'd ask anyway. 

  The heads I ordered from HeadFlow Masters, and I stepped up to the
36x42 valves.  The longtime VW mechanic here locally advised me that
it'll run cooler, but that I'll have to richen it up a tad to make up
for the increased breathing.  How do I accomplish that with stock FI?
IIRC,there's an adjustment in the AFM to do it, but I don't know what it
is, and I haven't been into the AFM box to see.  

  I haven't inspected the S shaped boot, but I've a sneaking suspicion
that it has cracks in it.  What's the best method (aside from replacing
it) to fix it?  

  Thanks!

Shad H.
