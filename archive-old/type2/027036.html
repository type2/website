Subject: Re: [T2] fi to carbs on 78 2.0l?


&gt;I've heard of serval people that have
&gt;changed over to carbs and were NOT happy, some have changed back to FI.

Couldn't agree more!  My dad bought a '76 new from the dealer when I was but 
a wee lad.  About 10 years later some monkey talked him into switching to a 
carb.  This guy didn't know squat about FI.  He also was the one selling the 
carb.  Never ran right after that.  Well I now have the bus and it has been 
switched back to the original FI.  Runs like a champ!!  I RARELY have to 
mess with it.  I drive it to work daily.  Just get in and she starts right 
up.

My opinion:  NO ON IN THEIR RIGHT MIND SHOULD SWITCH FROM FI TO CARBURATOR 
ON A TYPE 2 ENGINE!!! (unless they are racing with it) Fix the FI and you 
will get your money's worth in the long run.
