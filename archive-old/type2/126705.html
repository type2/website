Subject: Re: [T2] Protraining Manual 

Hi Volks,

I had two requests this week for the protraining wiring diagram, so I 
have posted the applicable pages to pottsfamily_dot_ca for a short while.

Here's the link:

These are fairly large grayscale jpegs, close to 400K each.

Happy trails,

&gt; Anybody have a link to a scanned copy of the Protraining Manual? Chris 
&gt; at Monkeybrains can't find the name to it. Greg Potts is having server 
&gt; trouble and I just can't seem to find a copy of it anywhere in 
&gt; paperback, hard bound, CD-Rom, DVD, wav. file, pdf, jpeg, at this 
&gt; point I would settle for a reel to reel.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
