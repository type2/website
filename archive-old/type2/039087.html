Subject: transmission oil

Hi Folks:

Well! After six months I finally got my 79 Bus registered and on the road.
Hooray! It would have been so much more difficult without the advice and
generosity of list members. Thank you all.

Can anyone tell me what people are doing for transmission oil these days. My
manual indicates SAE 80 W  or SAE 80 W-90 MIL-L-2105, API/GL4. The local
auto parts store all carry SAE 80 W-90, but it is API/GL3, GL4, GL5. At one
parts store there is a guy who is fairly VW knowledgeable and he said I
should use only oil exclusively rated GL4 or I'd have terrible problems (He
said:&quot;Ask me how I know.&quot;) I don't know what these ratings indicate, but I
certainly don't want terrible problems.

Thanks.

Rob Mead
