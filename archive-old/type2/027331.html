      I have posted pics of my '78 transporter on the web. I purchased the 
bus from a gentleman in San Diego in Nov. of 99, I am the 3rd registered 
owner. I have driven the bus ( that I call &quot;warhorse&quot;) from San Diego, to 
Tulsa OK. and back with no problems at all, didn't even have to top off the 
oil (which has been changed every 3000 miles, by myself and both past 
owners).

  the sunroof needs to be replaced, but all the hardware is good( crank, 
cables, etc.) and replacement roof panels are available.
  she also has a small rust through area, below the windsheild on the 
passengers side, that needs to be repaired. but as a whole, she is in great 
condition, and is over 80% original, the only things that have been done 
are, replaced the insulation board in the front of the cab area, and she has 
new rubber mats throughout.

   I will have pictures of the bus ready to email as soon as I get them back 
from the developer.

   I am located in Newport, OR. on the central coast, have only been here 5 
months, so there hasn't been time for the dreaded coast cancer to start.
