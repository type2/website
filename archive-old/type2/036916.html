With Spring pushin' hard some of you may be preppin' for
some weekend camping. For those of you who would like to
make your Kombi into a comfortable Weekender, I have a
full-width fold-down rear seat (sofa/bed) and engine pad For
Sale.  It's a custom unit that makes into a comfortable
queen size bed.  E-mail me for a photo and full description.
