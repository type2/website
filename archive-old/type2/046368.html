Subject: [T2] Bus Stove Conversion to Coleman Cylinder

A while back I remember somebody saying they converted their stove to run 
off those Coleman propane cylinders. My tank so rusted I can't get it filled 
anymore. The Coleman cylinders seem like a good idea for the amount I use 
the stove.

Problem is I can't find a regulator/adapter for the coleman cylinder. Anyone 
know where I can get one? I've tried the local propane supply guys, no luck.
