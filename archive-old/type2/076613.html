Subject: Re: [T2] Head Temp Sensor

Check to make sure that: #1 she doesn't have fuel injector seals that are 
leaking (or any vacuum leaks) and #2 that her EGR valve is not leaking.

Those were two problems I had when I got my bus and I had the same symptoms.


&gt;There's been a lot of chat about the head temp sensor lately. A friend of 
&gt;mine came over with her 78 westy (we originally met due to AIRS). She has 
&gt;been having some wierd problems with low idle and the motor dying at 
&gt;stoplights. i figured i would just spin the head sensor and make sure it 
&gt;was tight. When i wiggled it, it came out. Seems it was wrapped in a 
&gt;spring and stuffed into a hole that was MUCH larger than stock head sensor 
&gt;diameter. Now, what do i do?

There has to be a good electrical connection from the wire to sensor to 
head. Put a new connection on the wire and if the sensor won't screw in and 
stay in then have a Heli-coil or Time-sert installed. Then screw in the 
sensor per factory install.
Ciao!
