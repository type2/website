Ok here goes.  I have to build an engine.  I've got a dual port AE cased
1600 as a core.  Honestly I'm not a fan of dual ports because they are
known to crack and I need torque not peak RPMs.  I'm thinking along the
lines of a 1776 single port.

I'm looking for you-all's experience with the various configurations and
what has proven to be reliable and torquey.

I plan on full flow oil filter and cooling so also please factor that
into your recommendations.
Thanx!
Dave
