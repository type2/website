Subject: re: Firewall removal with engine in.  Can it be 


Craig asked:

&gt;Can I remove the firewall with the engine in?

&gt;How hard would this be to do by myself (one person 
&gt;verses a two person job)?

&gt;How long would it take?

Craig,
I did this in my 75 (with a 79 engine), with the
engine in, and it took me an afternoon, probably 5
hours,  including trips to 3 auto parts places to try
to find the right size of hose and elbow.  I had
ordered a new rubber piece that goes at the body at
the filler cap, but the other rubber bent hose at the
tank was cracked, and I replaced it with a metal elbow
and two pieces of rubber hose (fuel rated). 
My son helped me by leaning over the back seat and
helping take out the firewall.
Don't forget the 2 screws that are accessible under
the bus that fasted in the bottom of the firewall.
I took out the air cleaner, fuel injection stuff, and
the relays and voltage regulator off the firewall.

I also corresponded with a couple of other folks on
the list that sounded like they were going to attempt
this but haven't heard how they did.  Maybe they will
also respond.

Good luck.

Jim (in Wis)
65 double cab
75 bus (with no fuel smell when the tank is full)
