&gt; 	Sorry for all the questions... but I'm going to have a lot in the
&gt; next couple of months...

not a problem but remember a lot of this stuff is already in the type 2
library at www.type2_dot_com

&gt; 1) What type of motor oil do I use for my 1.8 motor? IE: 5W-30? 5W-40? or is
&gt; it even 50 weight?

that is almost a religous argument but any quality motor oil will work, in
summer a 20-40 weight would probably be fine, (I run 15W-50 Mobil 1
synthetic in mine)

&gt; 2) Is the Bosch distributor original equipment?

yes and no, it was a Bosch distributor but there are several different
models that were used, the 009 is commonly added later and is NOT correct
for any VW van

&gt; 3) The car came with a standard 2-bbl carburetor (I believe), but we also
&gt; got with the car, a dual carburetor set-up.. they're Webber carbs. It also
&gt; came with a stack of books, etc. Obviously, I'm not planning on entering
&gt; this bus in the 24 huers de Le Mans any time soon... but I was curious how
&gt; much horsepower if any that would provide over the standard 2bbl carb it has
&gt; now?

I run only Fuel Injection so I am not the person to ask about Carbs, but I
think VW only used Solex carbs in the bus engines

&gt; 4) Do you guys know of anywhere that actually SELLS used glass? After
&gt; looking at the price of refurbished side vents.. I'm wondering if I wouldn't
&gt; just be better off purchasing whole windows for the rear and buying new
&gt; gaskets. Of the places I looked.. they don't sell actual glass.

BustedBus sells used glass

&gt; Last question... why do some of my windows have the Audi OOOO symbol on them
&gt; and others do not? 

VW owns Audi
