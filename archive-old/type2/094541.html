Subject: Paint, or, in which I Investigate Airbrushes


Just sort of rambling here. This is not about Binks guns or anything 
with a pot. =^ ) You professionals will not learn anything here. I've 
been wanting to pick up a good airbrush, though. Airbrush applications 
WRT the VW Transporter should be obvious, e.g. it's sort of like Krylon 
but not so spattery and runny, and more fun at parties, PLUS the Krylon 
cannot be used for water-based body art. Nuff said. Okay then. Always 
leave them wondering.

I contorted myself picking up a Snap-On Blue-Point airbrush on she-bay 
for a princely $44.00 USD. It's really a re-badged Badger Crescendo base 
kit in a nice black plastic case. Snap-on also seems to have sold the 
Badger 150 as a Blue-Point branded tool at one point, too. That is still 
a good brush but the Crescendo beats it all to heck. Retail on the thing 
looks like it was $149 so I thought I was doing okay at $44. The Badger 
kits typically go for ~$60 on she-bay and they don't have cases.

But once the airbrush arrived it turned out to have a part missing, have 
to order a tip, no big deal really. And while I was shopping for the tip 
I figured out that dixieart_dot_com in New Orleans is selling the same kit 
for $69 new, or $45 for just the brush. I can't believe anybody can do 
machine work like this for $45, these little things are amazing in their 
precision. All in all I should have bought new, all the parts would be 
there and I'd have a warranty.

Anyway, send your kids over and I'll paint flowers on their cheeks, and 
some on your bus, too, if you want. Can't do that with no dang 
Binks. =^ )
