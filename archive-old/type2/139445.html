My alternator light goes out ~immediately upon start-up (the longest 
it's ever stayed on was maybe 1 second).  Maybe I'm just lucky, maybe 
my alternator is just in good condition, but I would certainly consider 
having to &quot;goose&quot; it to self-excite to be a bug that needed fixing.

I wonder if loss due to corroded wires in the circuit could cause this 
&quot;goosing&quot; to be necessary?
