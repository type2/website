&gt;    I just installed a tachometer, and you could imagine my excitement. I
&gt;know that my speedo is a bit off on the high side (the main benefit if those

&gt;figure i can find some sort of formula to figure RPM/speed ratio. What i'm
&gt;wondering is peak gas mileage. I have heard that the VW engine gets best gas
&gt;mileage  between 3,000 and 3,500. I think that this may be a little high.
&gt;When i run at about 65 on the highway, my RPM's are about 3200, and i really
&gt;dont go any faster than that. My normal shift point seems to be around 2900
&gt;to 3100, and it seems weird to think that my engine's optimal range is higher
&gt;than my shift point.
&gt;  Anybody care to share your opinion on this?

My bus, a 2-liter with dual carbs, delivers peak torque between 1800 and
3100rpm.  Given that you will get best mileage at peak torque, and that you
will get better mileage the slower you drive (because of less wind
resistance) I can make an educated guess that my bus would get it's best
mileage at 1800rpm, or 30mph (in 4th gear).  But I can't drive 30mph
everywhere.  :-)
