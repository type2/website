Subject: stereo noise

was written to george lyles response:

...And a ton of other things are equally annoying including typical Harley exhaust systems and the overly popular diesel powered trucks.  The fact that some people find these types of stereos annoying has little to do with alternator requirements.

I say:

You're ripping george about this comment having nothing to do with alternator requirements, and you're right, but george wasn't asked about alternator requirements when he wrote this. He was asked why a high powered stereo might be annoying. Get a grip on the conversation before you start harshing on people.


&gt;Having installed &quot;several stereos&quot; by no means makes anyone an &gt;expert on the power requirements of a true high end system.  So I'll &gt;word this easier.  Having worked in both sales and installation of &gt;the premier Audio Chain in Dallas, TX (Earmark Car Audio) I can tell &gt;you....

Let me word this easier for you. So people who've &quot;intalled stereos&quot; aren't as qualified as someone like you who has been a &quot;stereo salesman/installer&quot;. Oh I see. Did you receive a EE degree to obtain that coveted position?

&gt;and I can tell you this:  I can kill any of those charging systems &gt;in less than 12 months with 100watts of rated power. Just install &gt;two Orion 225HCCA's and run them mixed mono, pull the mono channel &gt;down to 1 ohm on say 4 DVC 10&quot; subs

This is where you just go off the wagon. Four 10&quot; woofers in the bus?
Is that car stereo enjoyment? I think its:

1. overkill to the point of stupidity
2. noise pollution

And you can argue that you have the right to put anything in your car and make it as loud as you want, but George and my point is a much more important one, that being how big of a selfish ass do you want to be about bothering the hell out people trying to put their kids to sleep at night? And what is the point where car audio becomes irrational?

Bill
