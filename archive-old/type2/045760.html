&lt;&lt; What size engine do you have?? Did that use to be a truck camper?? Are 
hills your worst enemy?? Let me know. Technically, you can cut any VW bus off 
at that point, and attach a camper to the rear?? If you also have water 
tanks, LPG tanks, grey water/black water holding tanks, how do you manage 
with all that weight??
 I once saw a VW bug with a camper attached. Does anyone know if that was 
made by a company, or custom made by the owner???

It has never been driven by me. It was non op. when I bought it, and I havent 
had time to putz with it. According to the old folks who use to own it, this 
was actually done by a company. remnants of the sticker are still there but 
to badly detioroated to be readable. I've been told its a mister camper. it 
does have a water tank and LPG tank, someone removed the original gray water 
tank in favor of a chemical toilet. If you mean the the bug rv that had even 
the windshield area removed, with a flat window in its place, I belive those 
where built by a company, can't remember who though.
