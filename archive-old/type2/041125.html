Subject: oil temp sender in 1600 oil sump

Dear List,

I checked the archives but found no help. To anyone who has installed an oil
temp sender in the sump plate of a pre-'71 bus, how did you actually do it?
That is, without removing the oil strainer... The sender is longer than the
original drain plug and the strainer is in the way.

I just drilled a hole into the strainer, just wide enough to accomodate the
sender's tip, I'm not sure this is a wise thing to do, though...

TIA,

Sami
