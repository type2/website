Subject: replacing front 73-79 bumper with 68-72 bumper(project report)

Hello List,

Well it is Friday where I am at. I have waited all
week to babble about my latest vw experiences. 
One of the many projects that I have been working on
my bus is replacing my 74 bus's front bumper with that
of a 68-72 bus. Many people have inquired about how to
do this. It takes alot more work than I previously
thought. To make along story short, it involves
cutting off the entire pannel that runs behind the
73-79 front bumper. This can be done by cutting just
above the seam lip above the bumper or actually
seperating the lip. The later is much easier but I
chose the first option. The Bus Depot sells the 68-72
style pannel that goes behind the bumper. It comes
with the seam lip that is just abouve the bumper.
Because I cut off the seam lip, I was forced to use a
pair of pliers and bend the seam lit up that was on
the new pannel. Then I just slid that lip behind the
nose metal on the front and welded everything
together. I am finish with all my welding except I
need to remove the doors to finish up 2 small spots.
By the time I get finished working the metal and using
alittle fiberglass filler and plastic filler, the work
should be un noticable once painted. If any one has
any questions about how, what,or why I am doing this,
please feel free to email me or the list. I can give
you the bus depot part number for the pannel if any
one is interested in tackling such a project.

Oh, on another note, both of my half  brothers have
joined the air cooled vw family. one bought a baja bug
and the other a plain bug. both need some care. Looks
like I will be getting my hands dirty. &lt;grin&gt;


Have a great.
