Subject: Re: [T2] bleeding brakes by oneself

Greg,

Yep, they have those at the flaps for cheap....the only problem being that 
the bleeder valve can still let a little air come in around the 
threads...or you can buy the expensive &quot;speed-bleeder&quot; bleeder valves for 
each wheel..._dot_depends on how you feel about teflon tape on your bleeder 
threads....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; 
&gt; I would think that adding a check valve and hose clamp to the bleeder line
&gt; would make a system like this system pretty near infallable. With a check
&gt; valve in the line releasing the pedal would pull all new fluid from the
&gt; resevoir, and continue to force bubbles along the lines until they are all
&gt; gone. My usual system of a clear jar and a short length of fish-tank air
&gt; line works great, but only as long as I have an assistant to pump the pedal
&gt; and keep the resevoir topped up.
&gt; 
&gt; It's almost surprising that I haven't seen this offered in a kit. Not that
&gt; I'm a tool hound or anything, but that's something that could come in handy
&gt; when working on the bus alone. Or have I just missed it sitting there in the
&gt; bin blister-packed and ready to go???
&gt; 
&gt; Happy trails,

&gt; &gt; Denny,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sorry, it is now Sunday, but yes, sometimes this method will work.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have had good luck trying this as long as I used a bleeder cap to try
&gt; &gt; and close the pipe going back to the mc as soon as I got the hose off
&gt; &gt; also.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Don't forget to lube the hose threads with brake fluid before installing!
&gt; &gt;
