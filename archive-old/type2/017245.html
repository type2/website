&gt; There was a very nice 70 DeLuxe Bus sitting at a local repair shop.
&gt; It was rear ended a bit in the right corner, but otherwise the car was
&gt; very nice. No rust, SUNROOF (very rare in Alabama), good and complete
&gt; interior, clock, very nice rubber mats, first paint.
&gt; 
&gt; It was supposed to be repaired for the &quot;little old lady&quot; owner, not for
&gt; sale.
&gt; 3 month later still not for sale.
&gt; 1 year later not for sale.
&gt; 
&gt; Today I walk over a junkyard and what do I see, the same Bus.
&gt; By now dented by the fork lift, drivetrain cut out with a torch. Aaargh!
&gt; 
&gt; Well I took out the clock and some small stuff.
&gt; If anybody needs a straight rust free front its in Huntsville, AL.

Golly, a 70 SUNROOF?
I guess that's why I have 13 type 2's
Al Brase
69 double cab, 4 Vanagons (and many other projects/piles)
