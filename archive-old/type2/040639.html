Good reminder... and couldn't have been more timely. I'm doing my first 
engine pull in 5 (or so) years and I just got doused with gas because my line 
broke when I tried to pull it off. (I just had to take a break after that and 
check the list.... ) After I get this beast out, I'm headed to the FLAPS and 
getting a petcock valve as well.

Another reminder... saftery glasses are a must. I saved my eyes just now 
thanks to my trusty pair.

And yes, Snoopy, I'm just **now** getting to pulling the engine... ;-)
