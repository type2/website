 &gt;How do we solve the problem of really bad rust and rot around the windshield
 &gt;of a '69 bus? I heard that Rocky Mountain Motorsports carrys a window frame
 &gt;that can be welded on but, I did not see one on they're website.

 &gt;No Bondo...I wanna do it right...but, cost is an object. I  have heard it is
 &gt;about a 22 hour welding job...let's see at 30 bucks an hour....well you do
 &gt;the math!
 &gt;Thank You,

Hello Scott......On my 76 Westy, I had my extensive below-windshield rust 
fixed by a body shop and it cost me $300, including a new windshield 
gasket.  First, the body man took out the windshield and the dash. He cut 
out the rusted steel and brazed in a brass wire mesh  to hold the polyester 
material, replacing the rusted metal and retaining the curves. He also 
brazed in strips of brass to replace the lower channel of the windshield frame.

When he was done, he had fashioned a new brass lower channel and compound 
curve for about 4 inches below the channel.  It is strong and made of 
materials that won't rust. In my opinion, better than new.

That was about 5 years ago.  I put in a new windshield gasket and replaced 
the glass. No problems yet.

It would take courage for you to try to do it yourself, but it wouldn't be 
impossible if you had a dry place to work. You could develop your skills as 
you go, and end up using Por-15 on any exposed steel at the end. And the 
materials shouldn't cost more than about $50.
