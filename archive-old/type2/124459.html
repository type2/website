&gt; Has anyone used loctite 574 on there cases. and what do you think????

I haven't tried Loctite 574 but plan to do so soon. It is expensive, about
$16.  Just switched from Permatex to Curil T a few years ago and I do like
the Curil T much better than Permatex. I have an old Porsche race car and I
have the engine apart often. Many of the Porsche guys rave about the
Locktite 574 so I will probably give it a try.
