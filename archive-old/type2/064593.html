&gt; How feasible is it to convert the 4 speed manual gearbox to an automatic?
&gt; This is the only feature stopping this car from being 100% perfect.

Better watch out! Them's flamin' words in these parts!

Come on, the lack of automatic transmissions, ding-dongs, and
whatchmacallits are part of the charm of Volkswagenhood!
