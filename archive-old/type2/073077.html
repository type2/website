&gt;I've been scouring the archives for a consensus on the proper/safest place
&gt;to position jack stands when lifting a bus.

&gt;I've seen three recurring spots:  torsion tube, torsion tube
&gt;housing, and torsion bar.

1. I'd love to see this get as fashionable as fuel line replacement: always
always use redundant lifts. A jack + a stand, a stand + a pile wooden
blocks, whatever you like but there should be two of it. I swear I always
do this, no compromises.

2. The point is to keep the vehicle up off you, therefore I wouldn't use
any point that flexes for a jackstand. If the bus falls off the jack and
cracks your skull, you will not be comforted by the fact that it sprang
back up afterwards.

I jack (either near the jackpoint or under the shock, depending on whether
I need to rotate the wheel) and then I place jackstands under the
longitudinal rails. The long beam things that run the whole length of the
bus.
