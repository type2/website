Subject: Re: [T2] Passenger door lock installation problems

I seriously have had very little use for my Bentley manual in my 1977, it doesn't seem to apply to my year very much.

I have R&amp;R'd my front door locks twice, it is a tight squeeze every time, if I remember correctly you come in low and then push them up, but that is a guess from memory, I didn't remove anything besides the door panel.

I need to remove them again but have had too many other projects in the way, otherwise I would do it tonight and tell you, but the bottom line is that it is very tight and there is a preferred route.

&gt; Im having a hard time installing the passenger door lock in my daughters 
&gt; Twinkie (75 Bay window). It is a very tight fit. Either it hangs up when I 
&gt; try to get it in position or the plastic cover comes off. Then I have to 
&gt; take it back down out of the door and put the cover back on. 
&gt; Are their any tricks to this installation?
