To Craig and list:

Mark Stephens is supposedly in oregon and driving a truck for a living, so said
a person(unidentified) a week or so before they closed up shop. And this is the
second or third time the Stephens Bros.  have pulled this stunt on unsuspecting
customers in the past several years. So you ALL might have grounds for a class
action against them. I'd certainly look into it!

My .02 1/2.

Chris.
