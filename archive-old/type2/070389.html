Subject: Re: 6/12 volt generator pulley sizes

&gt;I've been having problems for a long time now, where belts that are
&gt;supposedly the right size require all the shims be out to be anywhere
&gt;close to tight enough.  A little stretch later, and they're too big.
&gt;It could be that I have a 6 volt pulley on the generator, and a 12
&gt;volt pulley on the crankshaft.  Would this be likely to cause such a
&gt;problem?  What are the sizes of the four pulleys involved?

Crank pullies are all the same size (stock, anyway)
