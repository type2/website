Subject: RE: &quot;B&quot; on dash

&gt;There is a little &quot;B&quot; that is back lit on my dash, this is a familiar
&gt;site to me, since my Beetle had it. However, it's never lit before, I
&gt;had always assumed it had something to do with brakes, and with that
&gt;assumption figured it was supposed to light when the emergency brake
&gt;was activated.  However, now it will light whenever I hit the brakes,

I see from your signature line that this is on a 72 Bus?  VW wasn't kind
enough to include an &quot;emergency brake on&quot; switch until later (75 maybe?).
So when yours lights, it's one of two things:

1.  CHECK IMMEDIATELY:  Is there enough brake fluid in your brake reservoir?
If it is too low, you will be sucking air witch causes the indicator to
light (its real purpose).  If this is the case, park your bus until you can
fully bleed the brake system.  If you have lost a lot of fluid (and continue
to do so) and can't figure out where it is going, it is probably leaking
into your brake booster servo and you're in for a real mess to clean it up.

2.  A failed switch on your master cylinder.  There are 2 of them since the
MC is a dual circuit setup.  This condition is dangerous also because you'll
never know if you have a real failure in you brake system until its too
late.

Check your fluid level first!
