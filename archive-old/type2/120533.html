Subject: Re: [T2] child cot in front

&gt; OK so I have an extra cot that fits in the front of a bay window.
&gt; There is a young lady in northern Minnesota that has a 1969 hardtop

&gt; and isn't sure if her year came equipped with a front cot.  So did
&gt; all bay campers come equipped with a cot or do we need to install it
&gt; from scratch?

All of the Westfalia campers I've seen have the brackets, but I'm not positive
that ALL westfalia campers had 'em. All bets are off it's a non-westy camper.

Remember, there are different size poles for baywindows (as Karl will usually
post):

56 1/4&quot;, round, black = 68
56 1/4&quot;, 3 sided, galvanized = 69 - 73
57 1/4&quot;, 3 sided, galvanized = 74 - 75
2 piece, collapsible, 3 sided, galvanized = 76 - 79
