Subject: New Name

Surfing through the channels Friday eve with the family, and catch a glimpse
of a Dove Blue Split in a movie scene.  Of course the family gets excited
and we settle in to see more.  As the movie line develops, and getting to
the point, the lady is blind, and she is told by an unscrupulous individual
that a police car is out front watching.  She hastens a child to peek out
and tell her what she sees.  The child sees a &quot;truck&quot;..not a  police car.
The blind woman asks the child to describe the vehicle.
The child says it is a 'squatty truck&quot;.

A squatty truck?  The family goes nuts laughing.  Now daddy has two squatty
trucks!!

Have  a great week all!

Respectfully,
