Hi Everybody,  Posted a note the other day about a HOT generator and a
clicking regulator.  Well, after burning out another field coil on the
generator I found the problem.  In short, A SHORT. :) This was a boogar to
track down, and after reading a couple of other posts about this I feel
the need to ramble on about it.  For a couple of years now the voltage
regulator was clicking off and on in our '72 bug.  Turning on the lights
seemed to draw the current in such a way that it would stop clicking.
I KNOW a Bug is not a Bus, but the wiring on the charging system is similar.
This was the status quo until the generator bearing (on the belt end of
course)  burned out.  I had put an open bearing in there and knew it
wouldn't last.  When it went the armature rubbed on the field coil and
damaged it so it wouldn't charge.  I know because I TRIED to make it work.
I'm such an air head that I HAD to find out how it worked (or not).  Well
it didn't, and everything got HOT and killed the new voltage regulator...
It was clicking on and off furiously, all the lights were flickering, and I
could smell smoke :((.  So that didn't go over too well.  At least I knew
the generator light was working. ;)
  Off the manuals I went, knowing that St. Muir might have the answer.
First tried to see if there was indeed a short by doing the negative
post spark test.  Nothing.(even at night; days are just tooo hot for this)
This was discouraging.  Then I got the voltmeter in there and figured out
that there WAS a short.  Apparently when the armature rubbed on the field
coil it had made the small old short a big new short and fused two wires
together SOMEWHERE 8(   So i proceeded to go through the fuses to determine
which circuit the short was in.  But even after going through all the
fuses, the battery post test still showed me a short.  I knew that if I took
off the big red wire that goes from the voltage regulator to the fuses then
the battery post test showed no short!  So it had to be between the
voltage regulator and the fusebox.  I disconnected the wire from the
regulator and from the fusebox, ran a new wire around the car, and tried the
post test.  NO SHORT was indicated!!  YEAH!  After mashing around on the
wiring harness near the driver's seat the short seemed cured, but I know
it is like a snake waiting to strike until I get in there and tape it.
  I think this may help some who have had wiring/charging problems. What
it boils down to is that you can't always find a short via the fuse block,
and until you do there is a serious danger of fire along the wiring harness,
or at the very least, a roasted generator   :(

OK Ramble mode off.

P.S. Why did the Type2 cross the road? My dog bumped into the parking brake %)
