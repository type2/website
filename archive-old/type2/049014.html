Subject: Re: [T2] cheap welder? 

James Baldwin sends:

&gt; I see many references to &quot;cheap&quot; $200 wire feed welders in the archives,
&gt; but cannot for the life of me find any for less than $400 which is
&gt; outside my financial scope, $200 on the other hand is within my grasp.
&gt; Can anyone tell me where these &quot;cheap&quot; welders are to be found?

Do you have a Wal-Mart in your area? Go there and look in the automotive
section; they have Campbell Hausfeld wirefeds (no inert-gas hookup) for
$199.
