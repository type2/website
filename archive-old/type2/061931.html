&gt;&gt; I'm going down a hill in 3rd, and i let off the gas...pop pop pop
&gt;&gt; out the exhaust.
&gt;
&gt;I had all sorts of exhaust leaking problems on my '71 for many years 
&gt;before I finally took the what now seems obvious measure of having 
&gt;someone weld on flanges to replace those f*!#ing c-clamps.  It used 
&gt;to really bug the hell out of me to.  Theres no dignity in driving 
&gt;around a vehicle that constantly backfires.

Sorry to be dense, but could someone explain this to me?  I thought
backfiring was caused when a cylinder detonates at some time it's not
supposed to, like well before TDC, or on the exhaust stroke.  Usually
related more to incorrect timing, connection of the distributor wires,
etc.  How does the exhaust system affect backfiring at all?

Hope that's not a stoopid question...
Rodney
