Subject: no power at injector follow-up

THANKS to all that replied with help!  my buddies bus is purring like a 
kitten.  ;) 

what we found was all 4 injectors were bad (stuck closed)  bus had sat for 6 
months.  long story short is, after testing everything in the entire fuel 
injection system and everything checking out good.  we thought maybe the ECU 
was bad since we did not have any way of checking it, but we refused to 
believe that i must add.  we decided that maybe the injectors were getting 
power but it was just really hard to see the test light come on.  checked on 
my bus that runs and sure enough really did not see the test light come on.  
really weak light if any while cranking.  (yes light works, tested many other 
items in FI system).  Went and bought some used $20 bosh injectors and we had 
good spray all around.  installed and she fired right up and ran good.  all 4 
injectors were bad.  go figure. ;)  oh well i learned something. oh and 
filled with good gas and fuel injection cleaner.
