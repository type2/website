Thats good to know. Thanx.

&gt;Disposal of the dregs is an evironmental nightmare. 

Don't worry.  I would definitely try to have it recycled or use it as some sort of fuel or solvent before dumping it somewhere. We have enough problems here in eastern Ky.

&gt;I'd be tempted to
&gt;pour in a couple of gallons of new gas (gasohol would &gt;be MUCH better),
&gt;maybe a gallon of methanol, and just drive it away! 

oooh, i dono.  that new carb sure is running good...

&gt;Next best idea is:
&gt;remove tank, slosh it around with solvent in it, pour &gt;it out on sand or
&gt;gravel drive, get the tank a long way away, light it &gt;with a match. 
&gt;WHOOMP!! 

now, that sounds fun. ;]  I'm really trying to be lazy about this and not pull the tank, but i guess maybe i'll have to get off my _at_ss and pull it.
Thanx Al...
