Subject: Re: [T2] pulling 2.0 engine and cost of rebuilding

&gt;does anyone have a diagram or good instructions on how
to pull the 2.0 out of my 78 bus?

*no but it isnt that bad if your bolts arent rusty and you have the right tools.

 and also can anyone
give me an estimate on cost of rebuild? thanks.

In my area the closest i have found to rebuild my 2.0 ltr is $1600-$2500.

You can get a turn key for that.
turn key ois what i will do when i have that kind of money and then have my 2.0 thats in now rebuilt after installing the turn key.
Soon i would like to have another bus for the wife.
