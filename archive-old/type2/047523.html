Subject: Re: [T2] Bus to Fiero engine? / dizzy question

&gt; The hotter the engine runs, or the colder the ambient temperature, the
&gt; more energy you can get out of the engine.  the limits of course, are the
&gt; point at which the metal melts, and the inconvenience of carrying large
&gt; blocks of dry ice to cool the ambient air!  :)

Not to mention the chance of passing out from lack of oxygen while
transporting large blocks of dry ice in a closed vehicle.  Ask me how I know
:)

OBC:  I'm looking for a good vac. advance dizzy or a way to fix the vac
advance on mine.  From what I understand, if I suck on the vac line it
should move.  Well it don't happen. I get a lot of what sounds like valve
clatter at high RPMs, right before the auto-tranny shifts.  Could this be
cause from not enough advance?  How much advance does a 205S have without
working vacume?  I'm not sure if the 205s is right for a type4 motor but I
only have one vac port (Weber 32/36).  Any suggestions?
