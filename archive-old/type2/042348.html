&gt;You don't think it is a bad vacuum advance on the distributor?

the plates have been known to get rusty.
the arm in the vac cookie gets gunked.
the ball and clip get frozen.

i've been told they are the most neglected maintenance items.
i got into mine, and finished the tune up. like you justin, i had similar
issues with my pumpkin. a dissapointing rde too often. until today.
a-a-a-and...my rig sat for 18 months - not 10 years, but in oregon. toke
that cookie.
