Hi all!

The following titles are available from Classic Motorbooks
www.motorbooks_dot_com

(I have no connection or financial interest in this, I just happen to
have the catalogue handy)

Original VW Bus (subtitle: The Restorer's Guide to all Bus.....) by
Laurence Meredith

Volkswagon Bus Type 2 (subtitle: Buying Maintenance, Restoration) by
&quot;restoration expert&quot; Jim Tyler

VW Beetle and Transporter Restoration Manual by Lindsay Porter

Hope this helps......

Keep on bussin' on.....

James
