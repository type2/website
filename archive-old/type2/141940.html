Seaking of Webers...

This month's Hot VWs has a brief article on the EMPI HPMX which is the Chinese replacement for the Weber IDF carbs. Not much info in it other that the usual rubber stamp for the advertizer. I searched online and found several mixed reviews over the last 6 months are mixed.

The Weber NA website has some news that states that they will be making their carbs again (a strike at the factory in Spain a couple of years ago put a halt to production when the owners shut it down).
