Subject: Re: [T2] cargo door

&gt; I was camping
&gt; last weekend and the girlfriend couldn't open the damn door to save her
&gt; life at 4am to go pee.


Hahahah! The visual is awesome! That reminds me of a camping trip when I was
a Scout leader and there was a bear raiding the sugar in the cook area and
the cookies in my cooler right outside my tent. I was about to burst I had
to go so bad! I seriously considered just pointing it outside the door,
unzipping it just enough to aim through!
