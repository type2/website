Subject: NOT A BUS POST

im sorry, i should have done this friday but im about to buy a 80 911 targa 
as my new project car and ive heard of a 911 mailing list, does anyone know 
where it is? This things in pretty rough shape, no engine no trans no top, 
interiors trashed. Befor you reply ARE YOU NUTS, buying a junked one and 
customizeing it is alot cheeper then buying a nice one and doing the same. 
Dont worry, i'll still be around, not selling the bus.

~72 bus (almost restored)
~95 chrystler
~80 911 targa (on the way)
