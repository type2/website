&lt;&lt; Hi Charles,

If you find a bus with an intact battery tray around here you're better 
off driving it than making it a donor. But it doesn't happen often.

YMMV.

Happy trails,

Really, I sorta feel that too, many usable (variable definition) cars and 
busses
are being torn up for spares for others...
On another list, a member was writing how one type of car (Spridget) could
be cannabalized to afford parts for another (Riley, FWIW)...
