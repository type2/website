Ok, I hear you guys talking about outriggers, tophats and other terms like
jack points. I understand what a jack point is but, what/where are the
outriggers and tophats? Half the time I think we are talking about
sailboats! Seriously though, I know the outriggers have some thing to do
with the frame, right? What about the tophat though?

Thank You,
