&gt; That hole is where the wire for the head temp sensor goes thru on a 75 1800 FI

&gt; end of 78?....I have not seen it on 79's.

??? temp sensor is screwed into the hole in the head on the side of the
head next to the intake port on the side (where I have seen em all) there
is nothing on the head under this hole.  it is much larger than the hole
for the sensor, it is about the size of the spark plug hole in the tin
