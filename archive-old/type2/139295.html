If this thing does what the website says it does, you could conceivably 
swap out a pancake engine for an upright and gain power for 
accelerating, hill climbing, etc. while picking up the tax deduction 
and saving on gas. Rebuilds will be cheaper. Engines should last 
longer.

I'm still skeptical, but unless the physics of the thing works against 
our low-powered engines (and I don't see why that would be), this could 
be a big change for our buses. It's worth at least paying attention to.

Makes a lot more sense than retrofitting a diesel engine to burn 
chicken grease!
