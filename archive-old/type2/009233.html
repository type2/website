Subject: Getting parts for your bus

Enough about the Bus Depot. The real issue is how to get parts for a 
vehicle that went out of production twenty or more years ago. That's part 
of the learning curve -- every bit as much as learning to do the 
mechanical work. Here are some strategies I have learned over the past year.

Strategy #1: Move to San Diego. Within a thirty-minute drive from my 
apartment there are no fewer than seven VW-only FLAPS, five dealers, more 
than a dozen VW-only or VW-friendly machine shops, a Bosch-only supplier, 
and about a zillion all-purpose FLAPS. 

Strategy #2: Develop face-recognition with the parts counter guy at the 
VW dealership. I know, I know. But I have found that this is an important 
strategy. For instance, I once needed four small end fuel injector seals. 
I didn't need the big ones. I checked a couple of places that were 
willing to sell me a &quot;kit&quot; for $4.95 -- if they had them in stock, which 
they didn't. The dealer sold me four small seals for two bits each. I 
saved over four bucks, with tax. I asked him for spring washers once and 
he gave me two dozen, free. He didn't want to bother with an invoice. The 
trick is to try to guess which kinds of parts remain in demand, even with 
the change from air-cooled to oozer. And also, show your face. Don't use 
the phone with the dealer -- that makes it too easy to blow you off.

Strategy #3: Don't replace; rebuild. This applies not only to such 
obviously rebuildable parts as alternators and starters, but to other 
things as well. The strategy takes some time -- you need to shop around 
until you find welders, fabricators, and machine shop people who are 
competent and sympathetic. Also, if you can, stay and watch. Don't be a 
pest, but don't act like a &quot;consumer&quot; either. Finally (and this should be 
obivous) look for VWs in the parking lots. The best indicator is a bus 
with the service's logo painted on it (yep, we have those in San Diego).

Strategy #4: If you need a part and the need is urgent, be prepared to do 
the legwork yourself. Recognize that there are two kinds of urgent. The 
first kind is where you didn't or couldn't plan ahead. In such a case, be 
prepared to put some effort into resolving your problem. The second kind 
is when you break down on the road and you need a part to get back on the 
road. If people would only use the word &quot;urgent&quot; for the second kind, the 
word might have some meaning.

Just some thoughts on a Friday morning ....
