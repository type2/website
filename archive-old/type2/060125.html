Subject: $150 bus, AC, no frame rust!

Saw a 76 bus today West of Springfield, Va. that the guy (Automotive
Specialties, on Lee Highway, Merrifield) will not part out, but send to the
salvager/crusher after he pulls the engine for a kit car and tosses the
fuel injection stuff-(Barry showed it to me)- has perfect frame, front end,
good bumpers (rear dent) straight body, but sat under a tree and has
surface rust (no holes!).   Has COMPLETE air conditioning, with the roof
unit, controls, 2 condensors, and pump!  Said he will sell it complete only
for $150 if you haul it-he's pulling the engine Sat.
If Barry can chase the hauler, I want the trans and front seats (all seats
perfect condition) except ticking feels crumbly.  You DC, Va guys taking
note??   It's too far for me to come back........MB
