&gt; Hi folks;
&gt;     My question is:   Are there any particular disadvantages to a 73 model, 
&gt;compared to any other year? 

Originally a dual carb engine. If the original Solexes are there, there is
a 95% chance the throttle shafts and bores are worn which is a PITA. Cannot
get a steady idle no way no how, which is why most have been converted to
the DFEV dual stage single Weber, which is much better when jetted right
than worn out Solexes, but not near as good as new Solexes, ie stock. 

Dilema??? Compromise and live with the Weber DFEV after you get it jetted
proper or put a pair of Weber 40 IDF carbs on and have some great running
with some spittin' and poppin' just enough to add character, but at three
times the price of the DFEV single progressive. 

Know that if you go for the lower cost IDF kits you get offal for linkage.
It would be $1000 for a good kit installed and tuned at a competant shop,
if you can find one, for a good setup that WORKS with a bit more unpph than
stock but at some cost to mileage. A custom cam profile can improve milage
but requires the cost of teardown, which is no extra if compression is iffy
but extra time/money if not.

If you have the original carbs they can be rebushed for a reasonable price,
but results will be lacking if the shafts are worn. I know of no source for
new shafts. Teardown and measure of the shafts is necessary before you can
know if the carbs are rebuildable. If they are, that's the best way to go.
The motor will never run better in all daily situations than all stock,
period.  

Go DFEV if cheap is important, IDFs if performance and good function is
desired, and stock if you want trouble free clean running as required by
the engineers who designed the original maschine and are willing to pay the
price for excellance in normal daily driving. 

I have a set of NEW Solexes for my '72. They are not for sale at any price
that most would consider reasonable. I don't know how I could replace them
for $1000. I wouldn't sell them for that, at least I don't think so, 'cause
I would prefer stock to even the same cost for IDF's with funky linkages
and multi iterations of expensive jet changes to dial in the custom cam and
other mods to take advantage of the boost in potential with overbore
cylinders thrown in for a kicker.

 I realize the 2.0 
&gt;engines are stronger, but do the extra sensors, fuel injection, etc.  make
it 
&gt;more hassle too? 

Either a stock carburated engine in spec or stock F.I. engine in spec will
be a joy to drive.

Carbs need to be disassembled and cleaned ever 3, 5 or 7 years, depending
how you use and maintain the vehicle. F.I. will last a long time but when
problems develop, the do it youselfer is typically forced to replace parts
'till you find the poor ground wire that was the problem all along.  To
replace all the main F.I. components with new parts probably will cost more
than replacing a pair of IDF's. Weber carbs have ball bearing shafts which
are replacable if you ever do wear them out, a big advange over Solexes
with pot metal shaft bores. 

Any more questions??? Regardless the situation, it will take several
hundreds of dollars to a 'coupla grand to ACTUALLY solve the original dual
carbed motor problems in the 72-74 Type 2's. That is, if you want no more
hassels whatsoever with regard to efficient fuel delivery throughout the
RPM range.

Don't even think of fuel system diagnosis until you have verified
mechanical and ignition systems integrity and spec adjustments. 

See &quot;Vaccuum Schlucks&quot; in the archives to diagnose worn throttle shafts
schlucking past worn throttle shafts bores.
