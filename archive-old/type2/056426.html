Subject: Brake Booster Transplant

Hi listers....
Just got the master cyl. / booster assem. from the '79 donor bus
successfully installed in the '72 campmobile. (fits like it was made to....
fyi) WOW!! I stop with the greatest of ease, and I don't stall out in the
process.  I've had the bus 4 yrs. now without a functioning brake servo and
boy am I a happy boy!! Also replaced the lower ball joints(new), all tie
rods(from donor), e brake cables and rear shoes(new).  Now if I can just
get that 2.0l installed with those beautiful heater boxes I got from Karl
......
Just thought you might like to know...
