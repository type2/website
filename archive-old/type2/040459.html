Subject: Re: Even more ridiculous general questions......

Matt so eloquently wonders:

&gt; (Where is that Bus name page anyway?).

That would be:

http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~visket/Type2/BusNames.htm

Save it. Bookmark it. Cherish it.

&gt;
&gt; 1. The transaxle's got a thin layer of oil around the bottom (Nothing
major,
&gt; just slow seepage).  Try as I might, I can't get that plug out to see if
I'm
&gt; low....any special tools or tricks?

Foreign FLAPS has the 17mm hex tool that fits on a 3/8&quot; ratchet.

&gt;
&gt; 2. The sheet metal question.  I've decided to do a sheet metal and battery
&gt; tray replacement on the right rear corner panel, instead of dealing with
the
&gt; bondo.  Any ideas about labor costs?  I know I can get quality panels from
&gt; the Bus Depot.

Labor cost = (What you think is fair) * 4

&gt;
&gt; 3. Tachometer- I'd like to get a tach so I can see how many rpm's I'm
pushing
&gt; on the free way.  The instrument  panel has a blank hole in it on the
right
&gt; side, but I haven't seen any guages to fit it-also, i'd like the tach to
be
&gt; pretty cheap and easy to install-any ideas?

VDO. You are running an 091 tranny with .88 4th and 4.57 R&amp;P. With
195/75*14's 60 MPH = Approximately 3200+ RPM. If the gearing calculator at
http://www.scottandmaggie_dot_com ever responds, put in your own numbers for the
tires you have.

&gt;
&gt; Trying to finally get up to speed

Speed if a relative term when it comes to our busses, eh?
