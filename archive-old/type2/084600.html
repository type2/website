Subject: Shop diary, April 02



Within the last month I saw a Vanagon come in running very poor and putting 
off a lot of smoke. It was at least a full quart over full from gas 
dilution from constant short commuting. It took months for this to occur, 
meaning the oil level had not been checked, even at the garage it got towed 
from to me 'cause they couldn't make it run right. Even the &quot;experts&quot; at 
the prior shop didn't check the oil level. They are certified by ASC and 
AAA, just paper hanging on the wall, a testiment to their skills.  In 
addition, the oil being used was 5w-30. Thank God they did the right thing 
and sent them to me.

I also saw a BIGSIXBIMMER in the last month that had been serviced at the 
dealer to about 80K miles. My wizbang on-board, real time, Euro specific 
computer interface diagnostics system pinpointed the running problem as the 
oxy sensor. It was called for replacement by standard procedure at 60K. Not 
even the dealers will add a $250 part to the invoice if they gave a quote 
for a 60k service and forgot to include something. More than enough parts 
were replaced in this case unnecessarily to have paid for the part that 
needed to be replaced. Abscence of real value with presents of negative 
value = results wanting still with the real cost to fix the real problem 
and finally make it WORK RIGHT.

And just last week had another Vanagon come in running very poor right 
after a &quot;tune-up&quot; at a &quot;reputable&quot; metropolitan shop. Gas mileage was half 
what it was before, and before the &quot;tune-up&quot; the motor was running quite 
good. Plugs were carbon fouled. It took me over an hour of validating and 
testing till I saw while monitoring the oxy feedback drops to 0 volts 
intermittently. I found the copper static shielding for the oxy wire was 
grounding the circuit at the terminal. First time I've seen that in 
hundreds of these Bosch harnesses. An anomaly, caught in the coarse of 
standard given procedures. I trimmed and insulated things, replaced the oxy 
sensor, then verified the timing/idle/mixture and all is well. I noted in 
the history of invoices on this vehicle that it had never, since new, had a 
proper cooling system service. Even when the motor was replaced, they 
pinched the hoses and reused half the filthy coolant to enhance the 
deterioration of the new motor right out of the box. Not a single invoice 
since new showed a charge for new coolant, except for the motor replacement 
which charged for one gallon, half that required by a whole system 
service.  This is a common occurrence with Wasserboxers. The cause of 
failure here is bone head simple. Lack of reasonable maintenance procedure.

The client came back the next day to say, &quot;It's never ran this good, what 
did you do??&quot;  You just can't imagine how many times per year I hear this. 
I take on new clients at no more than 1 per month, so that means I hear 
this several times per year. This one is now on the list because they 
followed up and agreed to pay me to make it WORK RIGHT, and not waste 
time/money in the process. I always follow the easiest path to insure 
against risk of low value, from poor results, from wasted efforts. It means 
I accept doing what the Neandereers say to do and do it their way so I 
don't have to risk failure. And because following their process I get the 
full benefit of their proprietary, in-house, exhaustive DATA, and their 
analysis, recommendations and specifications from the otherwise 
unobtainable DATA base. I get the benefit of insured results by simply 
following given procedure. I get far better results from following their 
procedure than I can possibly get by trying to outthink a thinktank of the 
best engineers in the world. How exceedingly arrogant, egotistical  that 
is. This is exactly what you do if you skip steps or ignore given advice 
and specs in the Bentley.

My answer to the common new client question??? I followed factory given 
procedures to validate all systems specifications. I read and followed the 
manufactures advice, step by step. I had as foundation  a decade of hands 
on paid experience doing just that with the products from the European 
automotive systems engineers.

In each case above, the foundation of the problem was absents of reasonable 
maintenance inspection procedures as given by the factory, even by a 
'certified' dealer.

Can you image what happens to an economy when half the charges for goods 
and services create either no or negative value??? With our high degree of 
specialization today, most people are highly knowledgeable in one area 
only, their limited area of practice, and totally ignorant in 90% of the 
rest of reality. It makes them vulnerable to claims and testimonials which 
have nothing whatsoever to do with competent peer review. That's why spam 
emails and informercials run rampant, cause they work well enough on an 
ignorant populace to create the perception of value where no value 
whatsoever exists in fact. Many charlatans are becoming millionaires 
selling nothing for something, with the gwebs buying in, then demanding 
validation of the wisdom of their purchase by getting others to buy in.

I buy into a raft of claims and testimonials. I can't prove it doesn't 
work. Ergo, I'll assume it works without need of any proof and I am 
self-validated and will repeat the claims and give the testimony of my 
subjective process as proof, and swear on a stack of Bibles I know better 
than these uppity Neandereers. They can't tell me what's best for MY T-II. 
I'll do a running test on 2 vehicles and I'm sure I will know better than 
their thousands of tests per year. And I don't even have to write down all 
the data I didn't measure in a form suitable for peer (layman) review. My 
claim should be enough, what more proof could you need???

So, all you gwebs out there. I just got news from my realtor in Florida 
that they discovered LAND on my property. I believe it will be worth 
MILLIONS, hopefully, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS, in a few short years. But I need 
some capital RIGHT NOW so it must be SOLD AT A LOSS to me and the HUGE 
SHORT-TERM GAINS must be passed on to someone else WISE enough to CASH IN 
on this once in a LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY for YOU. It will cost you only 300 
monthly payments of $29.95. That's $29.95 for HUGE GUARANTEED PROFITS. I 
believe you can sell out soon and DOUBLE YOUR MONEY. What MORE PROOF do YOU 
NEED??? And, you don't need to be an expert in land transactions to benefit 
from this UNHEARD OF OPPORTUNITY to MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.  And as a 
SPECIAL BONUS OFFER, I'll show you how to do it for FREE. Send me $5000 
earnest money and I'll get the paper work to you in a few weeks so you can 
obtain MILLIONS IN PROFITS for only $29.95. That's HUGE UNHEARD OF PROFITS 
for ONLY $29.95.  Don't be foolish. Act immediately so you don't miss your 
chance to piss in the tall grass with the big dogs. Be SOMEBODY to 
YOURSELF, for ONLY $29.95.
