The last order I placed with RMMW was for a set of front wheel bearings
amongst other things. I got one FAG, two SKF's and one CHINESE made
no-name. As a SET. It was the last order I placed with them. I tell clients
about this and let them call RMMW directly if they consider them a valid
source. If they then bring me junk parts, from RMMW or anyone else, I ask
them to see a junk parts installer who is not too terribly concerned with
his long term reputation for abscence of failure to get lasting results. If
you can't afford to do it right, PLEASE, PLEASE, see my 'competitors'. If
you want compromise, you simple must do it yourself or go elsewhere. 

I don't doubt in the least that RMMW is sincere in providing good parts and
services, but their willingness to compromise in at least some cases means
I can't be a part of their sales staff reselling whatever parts are in the
box that they send when the client approved GERMAN parts based upon MY
advice. Oh, yeah, the side door seal I ordered was 6 inches short in two
dimensions. That was the other part in that order that tended to ranckle.
No, I don't have the time to send the wrong parts back and hope the right
parts come a coupla weeks later. Can't afford the excess time. Can't afford
the excess shipping. Can't afford to look the fool to more than one client
per year. Solution, throw the junk parts in the garbage and take the loss.
Spend the time/money to find the real deal. Fix the client's vehicle,
belatedly, but properly, and under original estimated cost. Then learn from
the experience how to better protect my reputation by NOT sourcing parts
from known poor sources.
