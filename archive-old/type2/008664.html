Tom, since I just wracked my brain on this not too long ago - I'll tell
you were I found my error.  I went crazy - had others look at my motor,
reviewed the dist tang and angle and I still (thought) was 180 off on the
cam timing.  Then while driving and replaying it in my mind, it hit me. 
I was focusing on the left half of the case that you are dropping the
crank and cam into.  Therfore, I was looking at how the cam would affect
the NO. 3 cylinder, instead of the #1 which, if there. would be facing
the ceiling!

&gt;Hi all:
&gt;
&gt;Well, I finally got around to putting one of the two Vanagon engines 
&gt;I'm
&gt;rebuilding back together.  After strugging perhaps a half hour to get
&gt;all the crankshaft bearings to seat, they finally did and it was time 
&gt;to
&gt;install the cam.  (That is, after I removed the distributor and
&gt;distributor drive shaft as the timing seemed to be off 180 degrees -
&gt;I'll have to go back and re-read Wilson before I put the other engine
&gt;together.)
