Edson, Larry OCH [Tue, Apr 17, 2001 at 01:11:05PM -0700]:

&gt; Our vintage Busses don't seem to have the following that they do in other
&gt; parts of the country but I'm wondering if any of you are planning to enter
&gt; your Bus in the '68-'76 Bus class this Sunday at Kelley Park.  Maybe I'll
&gt; get a chance to meet some of you.

Larry, 

I don't plan on entering my bus, but I'd love to meet up with some of
the folks from the list. Anyone interested?

Bren
