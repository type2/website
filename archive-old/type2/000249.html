Yesterday I visited a 'car restoration exhibition'. Mostly geared towards
restoring classic British cars. My purpose for going was mainly to pickup
info on tools and materials. That also brings me to this posting. There were
two exhibitors showing a sort of roll-cage that you cant mount under your
car so you can then tip the car on it's side. This allows easy access to the
underside of the car for repair or restoration work. These things are not
really cheap (approx $800) but not entirely out of the question either.

According to the sales brochures they can be used for cars and vans up to
3500 Kg (7000 pounds!). The cage bolts on to the wheel hubs, so when the car
is on it's side the whole weight must be carried by two wheels. My question
is: Has any of you ever used a similar setup and what do you think about it?
I have my reservations about putting all that weight on the wheels at this
angle.
