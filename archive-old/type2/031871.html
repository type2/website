It is getting late in the season for buying a bus this year and driving it
home from it's PO.  So, unless I find a terrific deal on a local bus, a
rare sighting in this rust-infested state, I am going to wait until spring
to come out of my Wannabuser mode. 

My ideal bus would be a 1971 poptop Westy or mid '60s Westy or Sundial. 
The body should be straight and clean with the only rust being surface and
little, if any, rust-through spots.  Mechanically the bus should be
driveable to my home in Minneapolis or within 100 miles of home (AAA Plus
can take care of the rest).  Once the bus is home I can take care of any
mechanical problems myself.  Interior is not much of an issue with me so
long as it is clean.  Camping interior should be as complete as possible..
matching tent a plus! 

To keep my self occupied with VW's over the winter, I am going to spend
the winter building a strong and reliable 1600 dual port to be used in
whichever bus I ultimatly buy.  I have some questions on this but will
start a seperate thread for that topic. 

So, if you have a 1971 poptop Westy or mid '60s Westy or Sundial you are
thinking about selling this spring or even if you have one to sell this
winter and have room to keep it parked for the winter until I drive it
home in the spring.. please think of me. :-) 

Thanks, as always, to everyone.  It is good to be back on the list.

- JT
