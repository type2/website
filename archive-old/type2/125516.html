Subject: RE: [T2] Bay Window vs. Splitty

&gt; The brake system on the Bays is obviously superior,
&gt; as are most mechanical improvements to the vehicle, 
&gt; however these new innovations cost so much more 
&gt; than the Splitties.  I believe I will have nearly a thousand 
&gt; dollars in brakes alone!  The brake booster was the
&gt; the most expensive part, however I just spent another 
&gt; $225 today on new calipers. 



To some extent I think this has much to do with the particular parts
that you are replacing. Many of them will probably never have to be
replaced again as long as you own your bus. Brake boosters and even
calipers are not common failure items.

When it comes to parts that you may need on a more regular basis going
forward (brake shoes, tune up parts, front end or suspension parts,
etc.), I think you'll find that the prices of splitty parts versus
bay-window parts are much closer to equal, on average. In fact, if
anything, this situation is gradually starting to turn toward the
advantage of the later busses. As fewer splitties are on the road, more
companies are discontinuing splitty parts. This has two results. First,
it reduces available quality. For example a Brazilian aftermarket part
may only be available for a splitty, while an OE part is still made for
the late bus. Secondly, it increases prices, because the aftermarket
part that remains available tends to go up in price as soon as the
competing part is discontinued (supply/demand). 

Also, as you have noted, the mechanical improvements versus the Splitty
are many. Many of these you cannot even put a price on, as they relate
to safety. The braking system is a perfect example, with most later
busses having disc brakes and all having a dual circuit master cylinder
(found only on the '67 splitty). These parts can be a bit more expensive
than on a splitty because they are different and far superior, so it's
not really an &quot;apples to apples&quot; comparison.  However, when you compare
those parts that are actually similar (i.e. brake drums, shoes, wheel
cylinders, hoses) the prices are about the same.

In fact brake master cylinder pricing is a good example of both of these
situatuons in action. The most common late bus master cylinder is $12
more than the most common splitty one, but is much more safe due to its
dual-circuit design - certainly worth the small price difference. On the
other hand, due to the supply/demand problem I alluded to, the
one-year-only dual-circuit splitty master cylinder that IS as safe as a
late bus one, is SIX TIMES its price - $180 versus $30.
