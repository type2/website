I second that, John. I mentioned that I needed
wanted? a couple of interior lights for my Crew-Cab,
and she sends me two really nice ones, and an
'over-the-sink' camper light. Buy with confidence
from Nikki.

&gt; &gt;Freebies this week (further delving into stash):
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to make a shameless plug for Nikki's stuff at this moment.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone wanting anything she has, particularly the exhaust parts should
&gt; buy without worry.  The stuff she is pulling out of CA yards is for all
&gt; practical purposes &quot;new&quot; in an east coast sense.  The stuff I've got
&gt; from here, and the stuff I've seen Steve get is simply gorgeous, plus
&gt; she can track down a lot of that weird CA crap if you have a CA spec
&gt; car that has made it out of CA, or if like me you just wanted a factory
&gt; way to mount a couple of O2 sensors.  The fact she's giving away free
&gt; side marker lenses is beyond cool to boot.
