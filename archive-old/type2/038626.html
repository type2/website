Subject: Re: Help! Stripped screws... 

I would have to echo the comments about EZ Outs.  If a bolt breaks or
the head strips because the bolt is frozen in place, chances are the EZ Out
will break - not good.  One tool that has not been mentioned is the reverse
drill bit.  I think Sears still sells them.  You can make a small pilot hole
(in the center!) and then use a larger reverse drill bit to hopefully back
the
bolt out.  If it doesn't work, you can then proceed to drill it bigger and
re-tap
or heli-coil it.
