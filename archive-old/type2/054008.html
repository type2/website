Subject: Need parts 72 bus

Hey all!
I am in search of an extra wheel (spare)
My bus came with no spare.

And on a related note-  I was going to take the wheels and get them
powder coated before I put on tires.
What color should they be?  Is there a right color?  My bus is the
off-white, (can't give you a paint code as I'm at work right now)
I know the bumpers came as a different color...
Should the bumpers be the same color?  I can send them in as well.

Also, still looking for a 72 oilbath air cleaner.  I found out I could
use a 73+ paper filter but would like to stay original if I can.

Oh, How about a dipstick?  I have several 914 sticks but they are all
way to long.

By the way, I am in the SF Bay area but not opposed to shipping parts

Thanks!
