&gt;&gt; I have been bugging my mechanic to replace the fuel filler neck forever
now,
&gt;&gt; and he is seemingly always to backed up and our schedules never jive,
which
&gt;&gt; is important since the bus is my daily driver.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Im now thinking about the days off I have coming up, and figure I may as
&gt;&gt; well attack this myself. But, what is involved in this?

&gt;there are darn few projects I haven't tackled on my 78 but believe me this
&gt;job has to rank as one of the biggest PITA jobs I have ever done.  and I
&gt;did it while the engine was out.

I've done it twice on my 78 and Yes it is a PITA. The first time the rubber
flange piece was NLA and I coated it with black RTV which lasted 3 years,
and this spring I installed my Australian rubber flange. The key for me was
removing the bulkhead (FYI there are 2 concealed screws holding the bottom
of that in that you get to from underneath the bus, 1 on either side of the
tranny) covering the gas tank and taking the whole filler neck assembly off
the gas tank neck. Makes it much easier and the second time I didn't even
have to take out the round access panel. I did this all with the engine in,
I just needed to remove the airbox and rubber intake hose etc.

I just assembled the whole filler neck assembly of rubber hose=&gt;metal elbow
=&gt;filler neck rubber flange thingie, and then slide it up past the gas tank
so I can pull the rubber flange through the body hole. It WILL take you 3
tries to get it all oriented correctly, but messing around with hose clamps
up inside the body just causes excessive stress. Once you get it all
twisted around the right way you just need to slide the bottom rubber hose
on the gas tank neck.

I would also second replacing all the vent line rubber connectors on top of
the gas tank etc. I replaced them all three years ago with hose that approx
fit and it was not doing it's job this spring amd needed to be replaced
again.

PS I remember my first time I tried for quite some time to pull the rubber
flange thing out of the filler hole in the body (after disassembling the
whole rubber and metal filler neck thing in situ) as it didn't occur to me
to push it through. There is some info in the type2 library but they didn't
mention that detail for the mechanically impaired like me :-)
