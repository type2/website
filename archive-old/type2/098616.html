Subject: Re:  Samba Effect  /RANT/

--- John Baker &lt;jbakerccymca_at_springmail_dot_com&gt; 
 I have also been searching
&gt; on traderonline_dot_com for old VW's and have found
&gt; some that were pretty reasonably priced.  I 
&gt; think the key is that 75% of the people who 
&gt; want to buy a bus want to just pay the money, 
&gt; jump in it, and drive away with no further
&gt; effort. And buyers are taking advantage of this
&gt; (and why wouldn't they??!). 

JB and list,
I've never had the nerve to really screw someone
on a price.  That pricing thing is also why I try
to buy in the fall, after the wives tell the
husband they aren't freezing for another winter. 
It also gives me all winter to get the thing
ready for spring camping.  

&gt; So I have had success finding buses that are
&gt; ALMOST road worthy, towing it
&gt; home, and doing my own thing with them.  

Yeah.  That is actually what I'd prefer.  But
even the non-runners seem to have $2000 price
tags.  Unless I know the engine rebuilder (AVP,
Raby, new longblock) and know the appreciates how
to drive a vw bus (meaning no 65mph + driving), I
assume I'll have to put one in myself a short
time after purchase.  And I think I still have
access to a 70 westy interior for cheap.  But a
poptop (preferably a late poptop) is a must with
2.5 kids.  

I do find that traderonline and cars_dot_com offer
more reasonable pricing than samba and even
ep_dot_com.

Peace and blessings, 
Nemo, the Busless Captain
