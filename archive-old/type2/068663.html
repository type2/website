&gt; &gt; So I'm trying to figure out what the timing for the Westy should be, and

&gt; &gt; H, nothing following. Muir gives &quot;H&quot; numbers for 1500 engines, circa
&gt; &gt; 1967... So what do I have here - a rebuilt case from a 1500? Is that why
&gt; &gt; the thing is working so danged hard? Man, I feel like an idjut, but why
&gt; &gt; the heck would you put a 1500 in a '71 bus?!

&gt; H means it was originally a 1500.    no number means it was rebuildt and the
&gt; number ground off.

        Do you mean this as a &quot;rule,&quot; so to speak?  I don't think that these
statements are strictly true in general.

        I bought my '63 Beetle from the original owner.  The oil drain plug had
fallen out in the early '70s; the oil followed &amp; the engine was toasted.
The 40horse 1200 was rebuilt at that time with a new replacement case.
The new replacement case has only a &quot;D&quot; stamped in it; there was no number
&quot;ground off.&quot;  According to Muir, it looks like the only Beetle engines
that came from the factory with serial numbers beginning with &quot;D&quot; were
34hp 1200s.  My crankcase is of the correct style for my '63, but its only
identifier--&quot;D&quot;--doesn't appear to be related to any serial number series
of engines of that style.  FWIW :)
