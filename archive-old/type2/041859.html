Subject: Parts needed in Nags Head, NC

Hey all!

Left Arlington, VA Saturday for a week at Nags Head
with the family unit.  Decided to change the oil
before I left which as it turns out was a baaaaad
idea.  I went to the dealer to get a filter and that
little copper washer but they didn't have the paper
gasket thingys around the oil strainer.  I figured I
would just reuse the ones already there.  Duh.  Anyway
I noticed the leak right away.  I plugged the gaps
around the oil strainer cover with some plumbers goo
and headed out.  We lost a bunch of oil on the way
down but made it ok, I think.

I disassembled it down here and the outside gasket was
crimped and torn which allowed the oil to flow out
freely.  So, anybody know where I can get those
locally?  I have another car that works so I can drive
around.  If I don't hear anything I'll probably just
have something Fed-Exed.

Oh yeah, my cheap wanna-be Monza exhaust blew out on
the way down as well.  Needless to say the bus is
running like total crap.  I'm probably gonna have to
replace that to drive home too.

Is the $80 extractor exhaust that Bus Depot sells a
Monza-style knockoff or is it going to last longer
than a month?

Ok, thanx.  Please p-mail me at worktheweb_at_yahoo_dot_com
if you have any local parts suggestions otherwise I'll
be ordering off the web.

TIA,

Bob J.
