Not only that, but they don't have time to send out catalogs either...
My waiting time is now at 3 months for a catalog. Last I heard they had
one of their &quot;lick and stick&quot; parties scheduled for the end of August. I
guess they ran out of &quot;lick&quot; so they couldn't &quot;stick&quot; the one I ordered.
They have already lost alot of business from many of us waiting for
catalogs, etc.
