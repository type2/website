Subject: Starter.

I have a not so new problem.  I have a 74 bus and the switch at the key
quit working to engage the starter.  I di all the usuall tests and
comfirmed that the key switch was indeed my problem.  Next I hooked up a
starter button from the battery to the button and then to the statrte
seliond.(bad spelling).  It works about 87% of th etime.  The other times I
get a small click from the starter.  The dash lights dim like it pulling
juice but the starter does not engage.  I used 12 guage wire. And it tis
the same wire that I have two Audio Amps. Hooked to.  Any Ideas.  Thanks much
