well that seemed easy enough. i dont have any leaks around the carbs, coming
out of the heads, but maybe a few little leaks right in my muffler. nothing
serious since i got a big hole where the exuast comes out of anyways!

so all i did was turn the mixture screw a half turn counterclockwise (on a
dual carb setup) and i dont pop anymore on decel.

gott it going! thanks list :) i'll tell you how it works in the next week.
seems good so far!
