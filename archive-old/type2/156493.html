Subject: Re: [T2] windshield replacement...

Tony,

I did mine a few months ago with the German BD seal,

a. It was tight fitting
b. I cracked my windshield

YMMV,

Billy
M'boro, TN

&gt; From: ARoman4047_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;
&gt; OK, so I've got a replacement windshield at hand and a new rubber
&gt; seal from Bus Depot...I've had the seal sittin' in the garage for a few
&gt; years (a tree limb has forced my hand and now both the old windshield
&gt; and seal hafta be replaced...;-(
&gt; The problem is the new seal &quot;seems&quot; to be way too small to stretch a-
&gt; round the newer windshield even after soaking it in the bathtub in hot
&gt; water and putting it out in the direct sun...
&gt; Has anyone replaced a seal recently (or even a while ago...)
&gt; &quot;Should&quot; the new seal be a tight fit on the windshield? I'd really hate
&gt; to break the windshield because the seal has mysteriously shrunk over
&gt; the years in storage... ;-(
