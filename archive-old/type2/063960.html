 I once had a coleman catalytic heater which was a waste of money and fuel..I
couldn't keep a van warm in colorado in the summer.  What I did use with some
success (and I DON'T recommend this) is a one burner coleman stove.  This thing
would sit on a slow burn for eight hours on one fillup and keep the van
comfortable.  I must say it was an old leaky '66 split window  so I'm sure I was
getting lots of fresh air.  I never got killed once.  John Jensen in Annapolis
