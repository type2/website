Subject: engine numbers

Can anybody give me a date of manufacture if I give
you my engine number?  It has come time for me to try
to pass our city's new emissions ordinance.  It is for
'75 and later vehicles.  Mine is a 76 but has a 1700
motor.  So I call this girl in Nashville and she says
that if I'll bring a letter from the dealer stating
that the motor is from a 74 or previous year, I'll be
exempt.  The dealer signed a blank sheet and gave it
to me but wouldn't take the time to look up the
engine. I know they have that information.

I'm going to write the letter but it would be nice if
I could say 'manufactured 5/73' or something specific.
 I can't afford a new engine.  Thanks....KR
