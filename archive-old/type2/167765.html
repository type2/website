Subject: RE: [T2] heat,  was Blowing Oil Filter Seals

Jon,


Time to get out the ole turkey thermometers and start getting some real 
world measurements....although, depending on the ambient and the engine 
load, I would think that 210 might be perfect.

Did this on my turboed/megasquirted 68 bug and finally figured out that
the turbo sat 1/2&quot; from the oil cooler(turbo blanket fixed that)...and 
dropped 15 to 20 degrees off of the oil temps.  Then started looking
at the inlet temps to the fan.

Found some heat recirculation leaks that I fixed and dropped another 5 
degrees off the temps...which were, by the way were about 220 in 95 degree 
weather.

Didja calibrate the CHT before installing?  Do you have an infared 
thermometer?

Oil lines or filter too close to big heat sources?  Oh, and where are you 
reading your temps?  Verified them with a turkey thermometer or infrared?

Thermostat adjusted correctly?  I had to go back and actually read the 
book about how to do it...I was doing it the wrong way to start with.

BTW, I am now about to finish an engine(a parially rebuilt clunker) to put 
in my 68 DC so I can move it around and start back to work on it...finally.


Cheers, dave

&gt; So tomorrow I am going to go searching for a genuine Wix 51515R, Napa Gold
&gt; 51515R , and a Purolator L39001 and have my own little showdown. I'll never
&gt; buy a Fram ever again. And I'm going to pick up one of each for my Mini and
&gt; my Jeep.
&gt;
&gt; I can't wait to see if this will fix my wagon once and for all. Now I have
&gt; to figure out why my oil temps are so high (210F today) and my head temps
&gt; are so low (250F).
