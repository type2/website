Subject: Re: [T2] Hooverfinding

Hi All,

To catch up with Bob Hoover, go to &lt;www.google_dot_com&gt;, and do a search on:

group:rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled &quot;veeduber_at_aol_dot_com&quot;

He is on usenet now, rather than the mailing lists. You'll get 940 hits. 
Happy reading.

Conrad

&gt; I dont know how many there were or if this site is authorised, but 
&gt; copyright
&gt; is mentioned and other Hoover links are there.
&gt; This guy is impressive. Quite the sad loss from the list community,
