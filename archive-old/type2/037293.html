Catalytic heaters expell Carbon monoxide so you need to vent it no
matter what! there is a  company selling heaters and here is the link,
http://www.zodi_dot_com/. They sell cat heaters and cat heater showers NOTE
the exhaust hose!. JC Whitney sells a RV propane heater that is fairly
low profile and relatively inexpensive. Combustion consumes something
and it is typically something you need to live.
