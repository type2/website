Try looking at the little stores  :)

Any good upholstery shop should have what you need.  It's called 'tack
strip'.
 
&gt; was thinking just a thin wood molding like yardstick size. I looked at the 
&gt; vertical blinds too but they don't seem the come in replacement sizes long 
&gt; enough. And I have looked at the rubber molding that goes around the 
&gt; baseboard of walls (comes in rolls).

Which model year Pop Top are you repairing?

&gt;
&gt; Also, what to attach it with? Staples? Tacks? or what about screws and 
&gt; finishing washers?

I used staples on mine because that's what the factory used.  A
pneumatic
stapler would have made the job easier.  The mechanical staple gun I
used
didn't quite cut it, IIRC.
