Subject: Re: bus help?

Hey, first of all, thanks for responding.   The rear main seal needs to be 
replaced ( I have it and the fan housing off), I pulled the distributor shaft 
so she may need to be timed, the tins put back on, and a few minor 
connections (i.e., wires to coil, etc) and I think that's it.  Probably take 
someone who REALLY knew what they were doing about 2 hours.  I'm a newbie and 
don't have the time anymore.  I would gladly pay someone what it was 
worth....and I'm anxious to get out of this 83 Impala piece of crap I'm 
driving now.

I live in Winston-Salem in an apartment complex.  They're cool with people 
working on vehicles and I have my own tools...at least what is needed.

Thanks.
Barefoot Connie
