Subject: RE: Rear Suspension Bushings

I may not have described this well enough in my post as I've received several 
replies from folks who say they just pulled the old ones out and slid the new 
ones in.  I'm not talking about the big bushings that go on the torsion bars.  
These are the bushings that are in the control arms where they are bolted to 
the brackets that are welded to the back-side of the rear torsion tube 
housing.  

To get to these you have to remove the big bolt that secures each control arm 
to the tube.  There is no way these bushings just slide in and out - there is a 
thickness of rubber on either side of the metal collar in which they reside and 
the bushing is tapered to the middle to match a similar shape inside the 
intended collar.

I'm trying to figure out the following:
1: which direction does the new bushing go (it is smaller diameter on one end 
than the other)
2: what sort of shop would I go to to have the pressing out/in done?
3: the bushings I received from BusBoys appears to be a little smaller than the 
originals, but maybe that is just due to the wear and distortion the old ones 
have undergone?

Thanks again.
