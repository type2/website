Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield wiper blues

From: &quot;Alex Wisniewski&quot; &lt;awisniewski_at_comcast_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Mike, I had a problem that sounds similar to yours, i replaced
&gt; the wiper blades and bent the arms but it didn't fix the
&gt; problem of the wiper missing sections of the windshield.
&gt; I bought bought a package with the wiper blade and blade
&gt; assembly together, not the arm though. That fix the problem
&gt; for me :0) Only trouble now is that I too bent the arm
&gt; and now the left wiper clatters while wiping because the arm
&gt; isn't true to the windshield...

I'm probably going to do that myself, Alex.  The blade assemblies have seen
better days and I'm hoping that replacing them will solve the problem.  The
ironic thing is that light finger pressure on the arm causes the blade to
wipe correctly.  Weird.

(Glenn, I actually thought about giving the springs a twist to tighten them
up or maybe squeezing the clip to shorten it's length.  I'll probably try
the solution above first, though.)

Thanks.
