&gt; &gt;I guess we can dream..
&gt;
&gt; The Fuch alloy is designed to hold up with no flex at all in 4 wheel drift
&gt; at top speed. That is more load than you could possibly put on them with a
&gt; bus chassis without falling over.

How about a loaded bus hitting a significant rock, or a hole in the road
that bottoms the suspension?  This will put a much larger load on a bus
wheel than a bug or Porsche wheel.

I've never seen a wheel damaged from side loads.  It's always impact loads
that do them in.
