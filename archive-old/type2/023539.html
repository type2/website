Hi all.

    A while ago, I was part of this list.  I was the kid with the 68 rust 
bucket westy.  I asked about rust repair and most list members told me not to 
bother.  They told me to drive it 'till it died and love every minute of it.  
I couldn't bare it, so I sold it.  Didn't lose any money, but I didn't make 
any either.  I took that money and bought a '69 beetle from its first owner.  
No rust, needs paint and interior; engine is still strong (Little bugger took 
my old lady and I, 814 wonderful miles to Humboldt County and back with no 
problems at all.  Even got stuck in the sand.).  Anyway, I'm almost done 
restoring it, but there is nothing like a bus.  So guess what?  I found a 
bus.  I just bought a 72 westy hard top from (you guessed it) its first 
owner.  It's been sitting for a few years, but it started right up...only has 
64,000 miles on the clock and it tests a hair under 120 psi all around 
(rebuild?).  Paint only needs to be buffed out.  Interior is all there...even 
the stool, cot and mosquito net.  Cool, huh?  Now for my question.  What's 
the deal with the type 4 engine?  Are they reliable, or are they junk?  How 
much would an average rebuild cost?  Are parts as readily available as the 
type 1?  I ask all this, because I'm not sure if I should keep it, or try to 
find an earlier bus...say a '71.  Keep it or sell it, I can't lose seeing as 
I got a good price on it... Any comments/advice? 

Sorry if I rambled...Thanks in advance...
The name's Claude by the way.

Peace.
