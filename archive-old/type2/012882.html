Scott:

I also want to do the lowering of the bus thing, and here's what I've found.  I checked out the kruzinwagon place in Australia, e-mailed them 2 weeks ago asking tech questions about a brake kit they supposedly sell, and haven't yet received a reply.  I contacted them about 6 months ago about their front adjustable beam, and it sounds a bit like the albatross beam that the Bus Boys sell, so if you want an adjustable beam, I'd buy the Bus Boys' beam.  However, the best way to lower almost any vehicle (trucks or vans, anyway) is to use a lowered spindle.  We're in luck, because Wolfgang International is going to be selling a lowered spindle for the Bay Window busses very soon.  As of 2 weeks ago, they were getting quotes from metal founderies for manufacture.  I may be one of the first to buy a pair.
