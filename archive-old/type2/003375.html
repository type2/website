Blake:

Go to the www.type2_dot_com site, go to &quot;Library&quot;, go to &quot;Brakes&quot; and then read
&quot;Caliper Piston Orientation by George Lyle and Michael Benthin.&quot;  This
should provide some insight.  Apparently, the pads don't line up with the
offsets on the pistons;  the piston retaining plates provide that function.

&gt; Thanks for all the help everybody, but I still have
&gt; one question, that is: what about the pressed out
&gt; portion of the caliper piston?  No one addressed
&gt; whether its OK to have one side up and one side down.
&gt; Everything I understand equals that both sides should
&gt; be down.  But again, everything I understand also says
&gt; that the pads should have a pressed out portion to
&gt; meet the piston.  What gives?
