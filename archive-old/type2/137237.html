I prefer a couple of bars of BlackDeath rodent killer.
Bwahhahahahahaaaaaa!!! Just kidding.

At the very least you would have mice that smelled good. &quot;Made for a man,
but I like it too&quot; :-) (Old Irish Spring TV commercial) :-)

Hey! New Jersey?? Just have a contract put on those &quot;doity rats&quot; !!



Tongue in cheek,

Courtney

&lt;&lt; To make a very long story short... I like to run my old vehicles every
few

months, get the motors warm, move them a little so they're not sitting on

the same spot on the tires and to remind the mice that these are not put

here for them to use as mobile homes. &gt;&gt;

 

A couple bucks worth of &quot;Irish Spring&quot; soap left in and around the vehicle

seems to repel the l'il critters...This is from a couple of other chronolog-

ically challenged car lists I'm on so it might really work... ;-)
