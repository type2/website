Subject: An EGR question that has me stumped

I am an owner of an '80 FI Vanagon. I recently removed my rotten EGR filter,
and made only two changes.
  1.. Replaced the EGR filter with a block-off-plate on the underside of the
tin.
  2.. Removed the linkage rod between the EGR valve and throttle.
Afterwards, I did the timing light and idle adjustments. Since then, whenever
I change gears and try to accelerate or coasting/ then accelerate, the van
studders and goes into a 5 second convulsion before it figures its' self out
and then everything is fine.

My question is.... Do I need a CO adjustment?........Or do I need to put a
block-off-plate where the EGR valve is?........Or is it something completely
else?    It just seems that the convulsions to my engine started after taking
off my holey EGR filter. Can anyone help with this studdering problem?

Much appreciated,

Ryan
