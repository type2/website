Subject: Re: [T2] Rebult Engine Troubles + WV

[...]
After a recent problem with my vanagon i concur on that one because of 
the carb replacement.  have some one push the pedal to the floor and 
make sure the carb is actually getting full movement.  my cable slipped 
and left me wondering where all my power went.
