Subject: Oil Pump replacement

I have a 1968 Westy 1600 DP but I am not sure this is the original motor. I am
replacing the oil pump and after speaking with the people at Bus Depot the
1968 oil pump is the same as a 1969 but no other year. Not being sure if this
is a 68 or 69 engine I provided the part number on the pump as 111.115.109A
but they didn't have a listing for that part number. I was told, by another
source,this is a 21mm pump and I am trying to upgrade to a 26mm pump but want
to make sure it will be a bolt in with no problems. The number on the engine
just below the generator bracket is D1428256  if this helps.
