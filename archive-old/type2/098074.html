Everybody is scrambling for bucks.  I've noted the number of junk phone
calls I get has just about doubled in the last few months, and the
salespeople are even trying to sell stuff to my answering machine.

I haven't received calls from the VW magazines, but other magazines have
made the attempt.

I wish that there was a strong VW enthusiest organization out
there.  The experimental aircraft people have the EAA, whose magazine puts
the commercial VW mags to shame.  Useful information and little hype.

Unfortunately, the VW organizations are fragmented, and I doubt that VWoA
would permit a large group to form.
