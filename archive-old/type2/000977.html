Subject: Web Developer &amp;/or hosting Needed for Bus Depot!
Date: Fri, 26 Feb 1999 10:16:18 -0500
Message-ID: &lt;000701be619a$f5cd8fa0$6e488dd1_at_the-bus-depot&gt;

Importance: Normal


I have an immediate need for the services of a web developer who can do some
work on my website, paid by the project.  The first project will be to add
credit card fields to the website order form.  This must be done ASAP.  In
the longer term there will be many other projects.  This website/shopping
cart/order form are written with SQL Server, Cold Fusion, Windows NT/Front
Page/ASP.  They involve a large relational database and custom written
shopping cart.  Anyone interested would have to have experience in these
areas.

I'd also like to move to a new web hosting provider who can accommodate this
site.  This could or could not be the same company doing the programming.

It would be nice if the person involved was also a VW enthusiast and had
some interest in the content of the Bus Depot site, which is why I thought
I'd start by posting this here.  Please e-mail or call ASAP if you are
interested.  (610-754-8901 home, 215-234-8989 shop).
