Subject: [T2] BA6 problem solved

Recently my BA6 heater has been a bit U/S, I could make it run if a held the
safety switch across but it would spring right back when I let go. Speaking
with another list member he had the same problem solved by replacing the
glow plug assembly &amp; this is what I had planned to do tomorrow (Saturday). I
popped out to put the batteries on charge so I could work with the radio on
tomorrow &amp; couldn't find a connection near the mains sockets in the bus, so
I thought &quot;hey I can use the auxiliary fuse box!&quot; pulled the front kick
panel &amp; noticed that the relay assembly came away with the panel (it's held
on with the same screw). Apparently this relay takes an earth from the body
_at_ this point &amp; without it the safety cut-out goes, when this is held back
the heater will light, but when it cuts out on the thermostat it will not
re-light. 5 mins later when it is totally cold &amp; the glow plug runs up all
the accumulated fuel ignites &amp; BANG big smoke cloud! Good fun I don't think.
Anyway, I left the kick panel off &amp; put the relay back with the screw (this
is a 'retro fitted' BA6) thinking &quot;it can't be this easy&quot;. 'CLICK' I could
reset the cut-out without the ignition on or the timer set, heater now
running very well! Just thought you might like to know. (I was considering
flying over from the UK to go to the heater seminar!)
