Hey there Volks,

I originally pmailed Shelby &quot;off-list&quot; as I didn't think that my
email had that much to do with VW buses. Since this thread is about
vintage campers, and the VW Westfalia is a vintage camper, I guess
this isn't totally off-topic.

http://www.vintage-vacations_dot_com/trailerlinks.htm is a good place to
start when looking for info on vintage campers. The main page also
has alot of good links to.

Alot of these vintage campers would look great being towed behind a
volkswagen bus (OBC).

HTH,
