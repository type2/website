Subject: Hello Jay

Well , the main reason I want electronic ignition is that points start to
break down at sustained high RPMs like on the highway . I need to completely
rebuild my motor , it has a little over 100,000 miles on it plus I have an
oil leak coming from somewhere near the cooling fan that is pressure related
( it's worse at highway speeds ) . I don't have gauges yet but you can bet I
will get them . I must say I'm pleased with my automatic transmission , it
pulls very well , it does not leak , and it does not slip or hesitate .
