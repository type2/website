&gt; I've been looking for a decent Bay Window Crew Cab, and may have found
&gt; 
&gt; While I've seen the tips about creating engine tin, and kits, to fit a Type
&gt; IV into a Type I engine bay, there is no mention of retro-fitting existing
&gt; Type IV tin ( probably because it's not possible, I realise ).
&gt; 
&gt; Would it be possible to swap in the engine (with tin), trans, brakes etc out
&gt; of a mid 70's ('75-'76) Kombi straight into a '68-'71 Crew Cab? The local
&gt; shop is scrapping a fairly complete Kombi, which I could probably pick up at
&gt; a reasonable price. Would it be a viable option to buy the scrapped Kombi,
&gt; and swap the later parts and tin into the earlier Crew Cab?

No.  the engine bay sheet metal is quite different.  There _is_ tin
available to put a type 1 engine in a late Bay, as these engine were
available in Europe.
