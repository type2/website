Subject: [T2] Nosecone removal

Friends,
I have a '78 Weekender that will not shift. There is some leakage at the nosecone. I purchased a &quot;hockey stick&quot; bushing in the hopes that this is all that it is. Questions are:

1. Can I remove the nosecone without dropping the tranny?

2. If I have to drop the tranny can I do it without pulling the engine?

3. Does this sound like a reasonable assessment of my situation?

4. Does anybody in the DC area want to buy a really nice '78 Weekender so I don't have to mess around with this?

Thanks,
Maui Haui
