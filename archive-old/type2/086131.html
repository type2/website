Subject: RE: [T2] Walmart Liberator tires

&gt; Well the load range &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; is for LT tires
&gt; only, I agree.  And I'm away from both Bently and
&gt; bus, so I cannot recall the specifics, but I
&gt; believe that reinforced passenger tires were the
&gt; standard on the bus, that is a 185/14 reinforced
&gt; not a LT185/14.  Our loaf busses were made long
&gt; before the current load/speed rating system, for
&gt; example the &quot;98S&quot; found on the sidewall of the
&gt; Liberators.   Anyway, I feel real comfortable
&gt; with the 1625 max load on these tires as it is
&gt; more than some 14&quot; load range C LT tires at which
&gt; I have looked.


You are right to some extent.  The actual spec is for a sidewall-reinforced
passenger tire.  The reinforced sidewall allows less side to side &quot;roll&quot;
when driving, and also allows a higher inflation rate. Same with a load
range C or D tire, so it's basically comparable in that regard.  I don't
recall off hand exactly what VW's recommended rear tire inflation is
supposed to be but I believe it's somewhere around 42 psi on a bus and 48 on
a Vanagon (assuming 185R14 tires)  - definately more than a passenger car
tire is rated to handle. That said, many people use passenger car tires on
busses (in fact, from the busses I've seen, most people do), so you are by
no means alone in doing it.  I personally have not heard of any actual tire
failures resulting from doing so, although I have noticed a handling
improvements when using a stiffer sidewall.

Myself, I have Hankook (Hancook?) LT tires on my Westy, Korean made I
believe, which ran me around $60 apiece and are either load range C or D, I
don't recall (D, I think).  I like the way they handle.  Someone on the
Vanagon list once complained about his Hankooks wearing out quickly, but my
first pair lasted quite a while so I bought them again.  That said, I must
admit that when I bought my Vanagon it had passenger car tires on it, and
while I did replace them with LT tires I didn't rush to the tire store right
away.  I drove on the passenger car tires for a couple of months until tax
return time, and lived to tell about it. :-)
