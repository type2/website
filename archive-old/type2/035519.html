&gt;I am at my wits end.   The engine is the MSHP Stage II in an '80
&gt;V'gon but the FI (AFM and Computer) is from an '81 federal bus.
&gt;
&gt;What I have checked: (note all checks were static or while cranking)
&gt;Dwell = 50 
&gt;Timing ~8 BTDC
&gt;spark visually verified

Hot blue/white snap, not gold ffflittttt??? Replace plugs if gap is worn
more than 0.2 mm wider than stock new or if fouled in any way. Also check
HT wire resistance and/or insulation suppleness. Cross firing of old dirty
HT wires can reduce good spark at the cap to piddlin at the plug and
contribute to poor energy while the battery feeds the starter motor. 

A coupla things to check. Cold start system. Pull the cold start injector
and watch for spray when activating starter. Fine mist cone ist gut. No
spray says check thermo time switch. Check grounds, particularly the small
strap from the left head to the chassis near the coil and all the ground
wires in vicinity of the end of the strap on the motor. 

Verify continuety (ohms spec) of the temp sensor(s). Verify that the AFM
flap is not sticking. Build up of crud in the throttle body can contribute
to this as well as a t-switch problem.

Should be able to do all of this with a multimeter and 20 minutes or so. 

There is just no way around verifing numerous functions. Just be sure of
ignition system items before moving on to FI diagnosis.

If you make a few measures and observations and cannot solve the problem
still, send the data for scrutiny and I will try to interpret and advise
further testing.

When wit falls short, try wile.
