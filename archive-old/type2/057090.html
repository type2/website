&gt;As for the F.I.  I am going to replace ALL the fuel lines.  I have
&gt;experience with the cloth covered lines, but not with &quot;american&quot; non-cloth
&gt;covered lines.  The non-cloth line is much cheeper (price) than the other.
&gt;If I go with the non-cloth, what size (ID and OD) do I need to get?  How
&gt;much will it take to do the entire fuel system?

   Don't know, but make sure to get the HIGH PRESSURE fuel
   line, late 70s fi runs at 30+ psi, so don't use wimpy 4-5 psi
   stuff. Replace the clamps, also.
