Subject: Re: grease for door slides (and any other weather-exposed location)

I have this tub of what is labelled as &quot;Boat Trailer Wheel Bearing Grease&quot;
that has all sorts of statements praising its waterproofness (printed on
the can :-).  It is designed for applications where a lot of dunking in
water are expected. I tend to use it liberally wherever I expect the thing
I am greasing to be exposed to a fair amount of weather.  This includes
(but is not limited to) the sliding door fittings, the clutch cable,
especially the front end; the throttle cable; heater cables; and parking
brake cables.  So far, so good.  I am certain some random brand of this
can be picked up in any boat store anywhere.
