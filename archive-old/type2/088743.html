Subject: Single Vac Dual Advance

Hey Folks,
Asked this question last week, and I have to ask again.  I am looking for
those who are running this distributor with a 1600DP.
I received a few gracious replies last week, but from those running 1700 &amp;
1800.

I really need someone with a 1600 DP and 34pict3 combination.

Thank you again.
