&gt; All this talk about engine fires really scares the hell out of me. I have
&gt; the rubber grommets in place and I do have fire extinguishers but I would
&gt; rather not have to use them so I intend to have all fuel lines replaced
&gt; ASAP.
&gt; 
&gt; My generic question is: can the lines be replaced  without pulling the tank
&gt; (and engine) to get access to where they are attached to the tank?
&gt; 
&gt; 1- Specifically for a '77 bus with a 1600 DP (European bus). Fuel line seems
&gt; to pass the bulkhead on the left (drivers) side.
&gt; 
&gt; 2- Ditto for a '78 2 litre. Fuel line is on the right  side.
&gt; 
&gt;

Not sure about the differences between the States and the Netherlands,
but the early bus with the DP engine-- it's a pain, but can be done,
just lay on your back and look up, you can find the gas line in front of
the bulkhead.  You can remove it from the tank, etc. Lots easier,
though, if you have the engine out.  CAREFUL- gas will come out when you
take it off!  Drain it first.

The 78, assuming it's the same, has two hoses to the tank (F.I.) and can
be gotten to relatively easily underneath.  If it's not the same as the
US version, I suspect it's pretty close and you can still get to it. 
Same caution applies!
