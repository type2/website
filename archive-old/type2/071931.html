This is for a 2.0 liter FI engine. Any experiences with these higher CRs on
2.0 liters would be appreciated. Bentley calls for 7.3 as spec on the '77

mid-octane gas with a CR of 7.4.

I doubt it.  You will probably be able to run regular with 7.5 compression,
as long as you don't overdo your timing.

My heads will come back from MSHP with 47cc chambers which they tell me
will be good for 8 to 1 compression.  They are unshrouding the valves and
&quot;reshaping&quot; the combustion chambers and they claim I shouldn't have any
trouble with that high of a compression ratio, but I have my doubts.  I may
chicken out and leave the spacers under the cylinders which violates their
&quot;zero deck height&quot; formula but will keep my compression down to a more
reasonable 7.7 to 1 (or thereabouts).

Some people will think that 7.7 is still high, but I'm going to try it.  I
can always put the .060 spacers back in to lower the compression if
necessary.  In the nearly 12 years I've had my bus now, I've come full
circle.  Started out thinking high compression was best, then the engine
died and I built a low compression (7 to 1) motor which worked out well but
only makes 56 rear wheel horsepower, and now I'm thinking I will experiment
with higher compression again, and try to make a little more power.  Bottom
line, I think you will do fine with 7.4 or 7.5 to one.
