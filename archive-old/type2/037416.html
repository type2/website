Subject: windshield fixed!

Thanks every one for the help on the windshield guestion
I ended up going with diamond triumph auto glass.
Called them last night had it installed the next day.
For the glass and installation it cost only $135
I thought they did a great job though, nice and tight.
Took 2 times to get it in right though.

One thing I did learn was that the rope I used was
to thin. I belive his rope was a little less thick than
the size of a pencil width. Which made it alot easyer
for him it seemed, but than again he does this every day.
At least in my case next time I will leave my windshield
seal and window replacement up to the pros. Though I heard
other windows are much easyer than the windshield.

ps. I am not trying to advertise for them or have any thing
to do with them, just had a good experience thats all.

Now both of us are happy again :)
