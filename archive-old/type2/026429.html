Subject: How do I raise the sliding door ?
Date: Sat, 23 Jun 2001 21:27:54 +0100

I'm busy re-fitting the inside of Ashley and it's going well. 

I recently bought a reasonable quality original threashold plate (that shiny
aluminium alloy bit in the doorway). Unfortunatly I discover that there is
no space under my sliding door to fit it. The paint is rubbing off at the
edge so I know some adjustment is required but only about 5mm.

I've looked in Haynes but can't fathom the solution out. The van is stock
apart from the bottom support for the door which attaches two only the two
bottom bolts and not the front one on the vertical edge. I've still got the
original - is the simpler one from a later van ? It was put in when one of
the rollers broke while the bodywork was being done. I will replace the
roller at some point but will this make any difference ?

Thanks

P.S. If any UK listies in the midlands want some Doormobile unit bits, I may
be able to help - If you can collect, I want rid of them ! p-mail me if
interested.
