&gt;Yes! I forgot to ask you about the reefer fans. I just removed my
&gt;non-working coleman stove, so now I can plumb some air easily from the
&gt;stove vent, which is right next to the back of the reefer, to a fan back
&gt;there on the heat transfer coils. I believe you said you just used
&gt;computer fans on the back side, and I happen to have two left over from
&gt;a gaming machine I built last year. The 12V fuse block is right there,
&gt;so I can wire them up easily at either end of some heater duct. Would I
&gt;be better off pulling hot air out high or pushing fresh air in low? 

I would do which ever one placed the fan closest to the coils since moving the air over them is key.  I had a hole already cut into the side of my bus for a water fill spout.  Since I removed the water tank, I replaced this spout with a small louvered cover and I have one fan (about 2.5&quot;) on the inside mounted up against this vent blowing air outward.  After doing that, I decided that there still wasn't enough air circulating over the coils so I mounted another fan (about 3&quot;) horizontally at the top of the coils and roughly on par heightwise with the vent, blowing upward.  Not an ideal setup by any means but the best I could do without some serious custom ducting.  If I run the fridge with the fans off for a while, then switch them on I can go outside and feel hot air exiting from the vent.  Both fans together draw on the order of 200ma, as they are fairly small.  I don't think huge airflow is necessary and good thing because I don't want to spend another amp or more powering fans.  I've made a halfhearted effort to wire the fans in so that they will only run when the fridge is running, but haven't succeeded yet.  For now I just let the fans run all the time since they draw so little current.

&gt;Re the internal fan, I looked at an RV center the other day and didn't
&gt;find one, although I did get a thermometer. I'll keep looking.

I got mine at Camping World several years ago.  I just looked it up on their web site:

This is a different model than mine, and looks like a much better unit than mine - I may have to upgrade.  :)
