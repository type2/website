Subject: RE:  Pop Top Drama!

&gt;My pop top is flying up on windy days.  But that is pretty normal 
&gt;but it is actually making metal jarring sounds and broke the pop 
&gt;top handles (crappy black rubber ones) during one of my trips 

I've been having a LOT of trouble with mine recently too (73 Westy so same
roof as yours).  The metal sound you hear is the front clip sliding around
against itself.  I've never quite figured out how that thing is supposed to
help, but it must have a purpose or VW wouldn't have put it there in the
first place.  I adjusted mine (you just loosen the 2 10mm bolts that hold
the bottom portion to the roof and slide it forward or backward) and am
having MORE trouble than I did before I messed with it.  

I even installed a dead-bolt style latch like the 74 and new Westies have
along with new rubber tie-downs inside, but that hasn't helped any either.
The only thing I've tried that works is to run a heavy nylon ratcheting
tie-down across the front and run it through the doors.  But that looks
goofy (like a big Christmas ribbon up there), has damaged my door seals
where it runs across them, and serves to allow water to drip on the legs of
the front seat occupants.

The worst part about the roof lifting up a bit while driving is all the cold
air that comes in from up there!  If anybody out there knows the secret to
keeping these roofs in place, please share it with the rest of us!!!
