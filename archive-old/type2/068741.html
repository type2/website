Subject: Re: heater blower

The Bently schematics do in fact show a relay (J14) powering the fresh air
heater fan blower. Therefore, the hot wire to the relay, which is fed off the
hot terminal of the starter, is a much shorter path than it would be if it went
all the way to the dash and back (much like the much discussed on this list
starter activation path). 
Emily, If you're missing this relay and your blower is in fact powered solely
from the red lever in the dash, you can bet you're not getting the voltage
needed to spin the fan at the correct speed, and the voltage drop would cause an
increase in current, in turn blowing the fuse. I don't want to lead you into a
blind alley here. Follow the hot wire out of the fan. It should go right into a
relay (mine's attached to the fan). 
If the fan IS hooked to the relay and IS activated even with the engine off, it
is possible that you have a defective relay. According to Bently, the fan should
only run with the alternator running.

hope this helps.
