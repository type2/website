Subject: Re: [T2] Westy owner's book?

&gt; I found a link a while back to an early-bay-westy owner's book (maybe 72?).
&gt; It was a complete set of scanned pages.  I thought I found it at type2_dot_com,
&gt; but I don't see it there now.  Anyone know where it is?  I searched the
&gt; archives too, no luck.  It was in a section on a website that contained lots
&gt; of publications.

Perhaps here:

On this site you can find a lot of old brochures and manuals.
