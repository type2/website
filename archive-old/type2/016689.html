    What the hell IS all that squeaking in the front suspension? It's
been doing it for years and it's finally time to do something about it
(as well as the ball joints and steering box). Is it the swing arm
bushings? The sway bar? It's not the shocks (replaced them). It doesn't
do it when the roads (and the suspension) are good and wet. I don't want
to get this beast back together and have it sound as bad as it did when
I started.
    Will four bushings do only the front or the front and the rear?
