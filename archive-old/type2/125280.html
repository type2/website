Subject: Clutch and Throw out Bearing Compatibility

I seem to be encountering a problem with my clutch and tob - the engine I am
installing is from a 69 - it has the older style press plate - the trans has a
newer style tob and arm  1975- the clutch seems to be slipping - are these not
compatible - do I new to change pp tob or both . Any thoughts appreciated - Is
there a compatibility issue or perhaps an adjustment of the cable - there is
absolutely no free play and the pressure to move the clutch bearing is
enormous

Thanks
Eric
