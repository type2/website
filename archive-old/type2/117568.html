&gt;  1) the front side lenses are just mock lights? no actual light bulb? Or did my PO do something weird?  Do I

yeah they are mocking you, just fake reflectors

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From 73 to 79, the front side marker bulb is in the upper turn signal unit. The turn signal has 2 bulbs in it.
&gt; A little bulb on the outside edge and a large bulb for the turn signal/flasher. Most are burned out and people
&gt; never knew they were there. #2 in this pic:

not in the USA, here the only thing in the housing is a dual filiment
light bulb, one is the marker/running light and the other the turn
flasher.  the little bulbs are the &quot;city&quot; lights never used in the USA
