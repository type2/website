&gt; how do i go about removing the throwout bearing in my 72 bus and also in my 
&gt; 69 beatle.

Take off the spring clips on both sides of the throwout bearing and pull
it off.  Takes about 10 seconds.

(not counting pulling the engine, that is)

Be sure not to mix the parts from the 69 and 72.  The cross-shafts,
throwout bearings, and pressure plates aren't compatible.
