Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS List

From: &quot;Duane Miller&quot; &lt;dmiller_at_dsmgroupinc_dot_com&gt;
 &gt;Just signed up on the AIRS list and couldn't help but notice how many 
people in Ohio own busses
What is the AIRS List?
How do you know who has a bus where?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Duane, did you just sign up to this mailing list?
If yes, did you NOT receive a copy of the list charter?
If yes, did you NOT read it??
Go here http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/012885.html  and read it again.
When you get down to the section titled Etiquette and List Culture read the 4th paragragh. Here it is:
--Search the archives and consult the extensive resources available to you
at www.type2_dot_com before asking on the list. You will get more information
faster that way. If you ask frequently asked questions (FAQs) or
frequently annoying recurring threads (FARTS), people will be inclined to
ignore you or become caustic.

With that in mind, on the home page of type2_dot_com is a link on the left side titled AIRS.
Sorry for being so caustic, but this is a FART.....
