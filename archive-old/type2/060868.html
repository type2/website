Dave:

&gt;Dansk heat exchangers

&gt;air leaks out of the gaps between the inner
&gt;finned part of the exchangers and the cover.

&gt;Anyone have a solution to this one?

You might try using muffler cement, or J-B Weld, or similar
heat-resistant paste or compound.  Here in the U.S. there's a product
called &quot;Pyro Putty&quot; that is probably more heat resistant than the J-B
Weld.  But the area must be cleaned of all traces of oil for these
things to stick.
