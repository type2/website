Thanks with the assistance with the injectors.  Installation became obvious
after I got new seals.  The old seal was so expanded that it would fall off
the injector.  Don't know why it didn't leak sooner.
However, after install ing injector with no more leaks and reassembling
everything, when I start up she dies after about 5 sec. The first time I
started it I got a backfire.  Did I plug something back in wrong or screw
up my FI somehow?  I saw other letters with similar problems in the
archives but couldn't find a clue.
Any suggestion would be appreciated

Thanks in advance
Having Fun
