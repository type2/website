Subject: steering box love

hi all - stoked to report i changed out my steering box on the 68. its been
said before, but worth repeating: hail to the list, high 5's to craig k. in
the library craig wrote if he can do it, anybody can. its pretty easy and
his write-up is DOWN.  i used different size wrenches on the nuts and
bolts, so ymmv.  the vw flaps/mechanic had wanted $120 for the job.  fweem!
- steve
