Subject: '80 aircooled power loss cont

Thanks from everyone for the responses, it really helped me in
finding a starting point.
2.0 f.i. non-calif federal

Non calif. model, so no O2 sensor.
Cat conv. already punched out by p.o. Muffler not clogged.
I misspoke and said timing retards when I rev motor - I meant
it advanced (timing moves counter clockwise on scale).
Distributor is single vac advance.

Last night, I replaced fuel injector seals - large and small
replaced intake manifold boots - 4
checked vacuum can on dist. w/ vac pump - operated normal

timing is jumpy now, rough idle.  I think I've closed up some
of the smaller and obvious vacuum leaks, but have made a new
more important leak somewhere else.  All vacuum and breather
lines have been replaced.  I'm going to put the vacuum gauge on
tonight to get some readings.

So, are there any other vacuum areas I should be looking for?
What should I see when I hook up the vacuum gauge to the
various ports?
