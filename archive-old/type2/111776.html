Subject: solex 2 barrel

Greetings all,
 I need some advice for a newbie. My '74 bus has a Solex 2 bll. carb. on it
that is in bad need of a rebuild. The bad news is that the local parts
places give me the following: 1. Never seen one like it, I can sell you a
new Weber for $350.(more than I paid for the bus), 2. You can't get kits for
those anymore, buy this used weber from us for $150 (may or may not need a
rebuild, another $30)and use the linkage off of the old one to hook up to
your cable. 
 Is there anyplace that I can get a kit for a 2 bll. solex? Or should I just
go for one of these options? I'd like to get the bus running soon , but, I'm
not in dire straits yet.Thanks.

Dan
