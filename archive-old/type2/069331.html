Subject: Re: red VW microbus identified (celeb bus thread?)

&gt; FWIW, it was a sealing wax red/beige white '64 standard 
microbus.

but most importantly WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO IT?

i talked with arlo awhile ago and he told me that the bus 
was his friends &quot;ray's&quot; but that he never remebered what 
happened to it?

i guess like they say if you remember the 60's you weren't 
there.

regardless it would be neat to find it. i seem to recall on 
the &quot;nice bus&quot; page mention of the fact that janis joplin 
used to own a bus?

i know she had a psychedellic 356 but didn't know she had a 
bus?
