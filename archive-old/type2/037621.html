Subject: stick shift qstn - help quk pls?

help - 
this should be pretty simple.

there is a plate under the spring and retainer beneath
the stick shift.
it has a tab going down on one side, and the tab on 
the other side has an additional piece of metal on it 
that closes the machined area off that the stick
shift goes down thru into the shift rod.

obviously the tabs go down, but which side
does the extra bit of metal go on?
drivers side, or passenger side?
it looks like it has something to do with
getting into reverse, perhaps to separate
seccond from reverse.

i appreciate any response, the quicker the 
better, i'm held up by this little doohicky...

can't drive it out of the garage without the shifter 
in place. drat.

thanks -
