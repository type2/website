Subject: Window Regulator R&amp;R

Hey all,
  I'm trying to put in a NOS window regulator I got from the bus depot
several years ago. ('71 Drivers side) 
 My question is this:  how on earth do I get the old
one out and the new one in??  It appears that I will need to move or
remove the front channel for the window.  Are there any cautions in regard
to this procedure?  I only see one bolt holding the channel in.  Should I
lube up the new regulator before installation?
Thanks,
Greg Schmidt


p.s.) And for Friday content:  I'd never take my duct tape out of my bus
in the name of homeland security.  Living in rural Alabama, the duct tape
is much more likely to come in handy for vehicular aid than for 
respiratory health...unless we're counting the smells coming from the
chicken farms.
Domestic terrorism?
