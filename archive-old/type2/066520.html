Subject: I had to reboot my '66!!!

I installed a bunch of digital guages in my '66 bus, one of which was a 
digital clock.  They all look great but the clock wasn't showing
any numbers.

A call to the manufacturer revealed that the clock sometimes locks up(!?!?!?!)
and that the constant power should be taken off for about 15 seconds to clear
any state in the clock. 

So, I removed the ground strap for 15 seconds, connected it back up, turned on
the ignition, and sure enough, the clock works.

There is now more technology in my freshair vent than any other part of the 
bus:-)  Downside is I might have to reboot the van every once in a while.

ttys,
...Markus
