Subject: Re: [T2] Front wheel bearing nuts

&gt; Thru the years, VW has used three different systems of holding the
&gt; adjustment on the front wheel bearings.

I only had a 1/2 hour to play at the wrecking yard this afternoon and found
out a few things:
I took the split clamps off a 69, off a 70 [both have wide 5 wheels], and
off a 77. ALL were identical. Left side left hand thread, right side right
hand thread.
Then I took the right one off a 84 Vanagon....what a joke! Of the 1/2'' of
axle sticking out, only 1/4'' of it was thread. It is the same thread size
as 69 to 79.... but the split clamps are way too thick to use.
Then I went home and popped the right cap off my 67. ALL the right hand
thread nuts fit the spindle.
I ran out of time at the yard....I don't know why they want to go home at 5
when I am not done.... and I didn't get to the left side of the Vanagon. So
does anyone know if the left side is left hand thread like splits and bays?
Or are both sides right hand thread? If both are right hand, I believe
Mercedes split clamps will work on a Vanagon....they are half the thickness
of bays.
I will check tomorrow.
