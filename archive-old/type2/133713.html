Hi Don,

If you're still confused about your engine displacement or year, check the 
number on the case just forward (FIF) of the fan shroud.  It's near the 
dizzy and oil pressure plug, and will be facing up.  I thought I had a '79 
engine for the longest time until I checked that number and found I had a 
'77 case with 2.0 heads on it.  BTW, I got the square-port gaskets as well 
before realizing I needed the oval ones.

It's great to hear that it's running.  Good luck with the rest of your 
repairs.
