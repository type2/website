Subject: Alternator functioning?

I put a rebuilt engine in my '70 over the weekend and got it running last
night.  It sure sounds great but I have one issue still.  I'm reusing the
alternator that was in it before and when I started it up the light didn't
go out.  This used to happen to me before but the light would go out once I
started out and was running at higher rpms and would not come on again when
I got back to idle.  I'm not ready to rev the engine up yet so I don't know
if the same will happen or not.

Question: Is it normal for a system converted to an alternator to behave
this way or should the light be out at all speeds?
