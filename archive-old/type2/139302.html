Subject: Re: [T2] AC in Southern Buses

Over here...OVER HERE!

Spoiled. Yes!

I can live without a lot of things, but in the South, A/C simply isn't
one of those things.

I find that I tolerate cold weather much easier (2.5 years in Keflavik,
Iceland proved that) and I've spent too many years in California
without &quot;needing&quot; A/C or even having it. With only the crazy Santa Ana
winds to occasionally bother me, I never needed more than a fan to beat
that heat.

But man...South Carolina summers are too much for me. And yeah, I guess
I am spoiled.
