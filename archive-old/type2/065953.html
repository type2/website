Subject: Re: starter bushing

I had the same problem as another list member reported: the bushing Would 
Not Come Out.  Lack of proper tools held me back; I couldn't get a screw 
to bite into it and I didn't have any taps.  Since I didn't want to go 
banging around there, I left it in.  I've gone maybe 1000 miles since.

Yes, I get the picture--Bad Bill.  Hey, I'd had a bus six weeks at that
point, and I didn't know diddly.  [Now, of course, all these months later,
I know some diddly.] Well, my list of bus projects was down under 100 [and
Urgent Bus Projects was probably under about 30] anyway, so this will give
me something to do. 

Speaking of which, no one offered advice [or asked about my organ donor 
status] re: maybe-exhaust fumes in the heater.  Is there a way to tell if 
it is exhaust rather than just hot engine fumes [that's not part of the 
diddly I know yet], and if so, does that mean new heat exchangers?  
repaired heat exchangers?  Something else?
