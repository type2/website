Subject: Cooling Flaps

Hey all,

I replaced the dipstick boot this afternoon (thanks again for all the
suggestions) on my '76 Westy with the stock engine and FI when I removed the
tin under the 1 &amp; 2 cylinders to access the boot I noticed the thermostat
cable was missing. The thermostat looks to be shot as well, it's springy not
tight like it should be when it's cold. When I started investigating what was
going to be involved with replacing the thermostat I realized it looks like a
PO had removed the cooling flaps. The linkage is gone. Assuming I can locate
another set of flaps does anyone know if the flaps can be replaced without
removing the engine?

On Richard Atwell's site he mentions that the Type 1 thermostat can be
converted for the Type IV engine but I couldn't find the link. Since it
appears the Type IV thermostat is NLA, I likely will have to buy a Type 1
unit, what's involved with the conversion?

I don't drive my bus in the winter (it will never see salt) so hopefully there
hasn't been any kind of permanent damage from the missing thermostat/flaps.

There was also broken wire lying in the sludge in the tin, a tan wire with a
90 degree female connector. Any idea what this might be? The Bus runs good, so
it doesn't seem to be affecting anything.

Thanks,

Doug
