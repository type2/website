Subject: Emergency flashers

I've searched the archives and tried a few things but I still have some
questions - forgive me if this has been answered before. The turn signals on
my 74 work properly, relay was replaced, but the emergency flashers don't work
(the green indicator light lights steadily). The fuses are OK. I've checked
the resistance on the hazard switch as Hanes suggests, but the switch seems OK
(assuming I'm doing this properly - switch closed (i.e. pulled out) gives 0
ohms). I'm assuming the problem may still be the emergency flasher switch. Is
there any possibility that it could still be the turn signal switch, even
though the turn signals work properly? Thanks in advance for any help.
