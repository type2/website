Subject: Checklist/saga/pinched nerve

Apologies to anyone who expected to see the weekly maintenance checklist 
by now. My intentions are good, but conditions are bad.

First, my '76 has not been running for four weeks. On the 25th of 
September (I think it was) I took off the DPO's carb set-up and began the 
changeover to smog-legal FI. After I assembled my collection of junkyard 
parts and new parts from Ron and Jim, I discovered that the only FI part 
that came with the bus -- the ECU -- was the wrong year. Karl von Salzen 
found me a good brain, and I put it in. But the bus won't start. There's 
spark and there's fuel, but there is no go. Timing, maybe. Time will 
tell. 

Meanwhile, I pinched a nerve in my neck. Probably happened while I 
was changing fuel hoses. Cramped up my arm and shoulder, numbed my 
fingers. That's why I'm leaving subjects out of most of these sentences. 
With a pinched nerve, predicates will do.

Maybe there should be a sublist for people whose bodies have been twisted 
and torn while working on their buses. 

Anyway, I will get to the checklist when my body parts regain some degree 
of mobility; and when the bus is running again, giving my checklist some 
bare minimum of authority.
