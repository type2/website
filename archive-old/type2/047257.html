Subject: Re: [T2] an annoying problem-need ideas quick!

&gt;&gt;   Today i decided to change the valve cover gaskets on my '80 vanagon,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; came across quite a predicament. it seems
&gt;&gt; impossible to get the clip back over the covers. on an older baywindow
&gt;&gt; it is easy because the heat exchangers are not in the way.

Huh?  On my '73, the heat exchangers are definately in the way, making this
job a major PITA.  Getting them off is easy, just pull the bail down till
it hits the heat exchanger, then pull the ends out of the head.  Getting it
back on is much more difficult and I still haven't found a good way to do
it with the heat exchangers attached.
