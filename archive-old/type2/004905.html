Any comments on the statements in the Berg catalog re: sythetic oil, which
they do not recommend?  It would seem that their conclusions are based on
testing they performed wherein, with synthetic oil, where the head temps
went up while the oil temps went down.  So they are claiming that synthetic
does not absorb and thus does not carry off as much heat as dino oil does.

I don't know many stock T1 engine folks that run premium...heck I don't even
run premium, but I built the motor conservatively to run regular.  I run the
cheap stuff with alcohol in it sometimes.  I am planning on switching to a
synthetic after a bit more research. Any way you look at it oil changes
*will* cost more $$, but if the temp reduction claims are accurate, it may
well be worth it even for folks without FF filtering in the long run.  I
just don't know from personal experience yet.

I calculated that going from regular to synthetic oil would cost much less
than filling the tank with premium instead of regular over 3,000 miles,
which many on this list say they do.  In that 3,000 miles you've spent $200
or more for gas - is an extra $10 for synthetic at oil change time really
significant?  Not to me, and I'm not rich by any stretch of the imagination.
