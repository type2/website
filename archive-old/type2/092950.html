Subject: re: trip, water trouble! what should i do 

20 years ago,, after experiencing many of the pump problems described on 
this list, I stopped depending on my in-bus pump.  When we travel, we just 
carry a few gallons of distilled water in plastic gallon jugs. We lift the 
jug from the storage cabinet to the top of the sink, take the lid off the 
jug and tip it up, and water runs out until we change the jug's position 
and put the lid back on....gravity rather than a mechanical pump. Works 
really great every time and has no additional initial cost. Maintenance is 
near zero, just recycle the empty jug. We get a new jug with each gallon of 
distilled water, usually about 65 cents at Wal-Mart. And that includes the 
water.

If you like the simplicity of air-cooled engines compared to water-cooled, 
consider using disposable water jugs in your bus instead of relying on the 
complexities and responsibilities of a mechanical plumbing system involving 
a water pump and tubes and gaskets and annual maintenance to keep it from 
freezing, not to mention the potential electrical problems if it is battery 
operated. And if your budget is incredibly tight, refill the jugs with tap 
water and use them over a few times.

my wife and i are on our 11th day living in our van traveling -- we are in
pa right now -- no trouble with the van except on our 74 we are having water
trouble!
at first it was no big deal, my water pump broke ...snip...but I had a big 
fat leak at
the drain tube (out of the bus) -- fixed that (i thought) then the pump at
the water holding tank leaked -- then the tube that takes the water to the
sink started leaking after thinking i had fixed all three -- now all three
places are leaking again -- what the hell should i do ????????????
thanks for your help list -- youre the greatest

take it to an r.v. place or a plumber - i am sick of trying to fix it - i am
not making any progress and my wife is less and less convinced that I am
able to fix things myself...
