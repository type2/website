Now there's a picture.  So the carbs leak but from where?

First thing to consider is what kind of fuel pump do you have. The 
original setup should be a mechanical pump on the lower right front 
of the motor( font means toward front of bus.) It is not uncommon for 
the stock mechanical fuel pump to be replaced by an electric one. If 
the fuel pump is now electric it should have a separate regulator to 
keep the fuel pressure down to 3 or so PSI. If the regulator fails 
then it will blow gas out of the carbs.

Second consideration is from where on the carb is the gas leaking ? 
It might be just as well to rebuild or have the carbs cleaned and 
rebuilt for you if are not comfortable with the process. If the bus 
has been sitting for a while the jets and passages will be lacquered 
over and should be properly cleaned. Gaskets and diaphragms will have 
shrunk and cracked resulting in leaks.

Good luck
