&gt; Was up under my 73 and I noticed that the tie rods are not straight, they
&gt; have a bend in them (both of them) sorts like a bow.  Is this correct?

No, they are both supposed to be straight. Been towed by a tow truck
recently? 99% of the tow drivers hook the J hooks on the tie rods.

&gt; Also, when I drove it home after I bought it, I could tell no brake
booster
&gt; action.  I am replacing the vacuum line.....is there a way I can test it
&gt; without the engine in the car? I have a mityvac vacuum pump I use for
brake
&gt; work........

You may [after your hands get tired] see if it leaks, but the volume needed
is massive. Got a high hard pedal? Either no vacuum from the engine or a
leaking master cylinder has filled the booster with brake fluid..... If the
latter and the fluid is above the check valves, the booster is destroyed and
must be replaced.
