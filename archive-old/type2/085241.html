Hi Michael,

Due to differences in the wiring and the limited accuracy of the gauges som=
e of the gauges are best used as methods of comparing the normal with the c=
urrent; ie you can tell if your engine is running hotter or cooler than nor=
mal, without needing to know a 'correct' temperature or what other peoples =
gauges read.

The oil pressure will give you early warning of a drop in pressure due to w=
ear long before the light comes on - you just have to know what it reads no=
w and lookout for the sudden deviations. As someone else said this can be e=
asily done by orienting your gauges so that the needles point straight up i=
n normal operation.

The tach should be within 100rpm so will tell you how close to max revs you=
 are, or if you are over/under reving for the current gear and need to chan=
ge. Again this is somewhat empirical data as you may not have standard size=
 tyres so the 'book' data may not apply. Once again watch out for deviation=
 from the normal readings.

The volt and ampmeter are slightly different as they will directly tell you=
 about the electrical system.
When you turn the key to the first position the volt meter should read 12v =
(or there about) if less then the battery is discharged (you left the light=
s on) or is not capable of being charged (buy new battery). The ampmeter so=
uld deflect from its central position to one side (if wired correctly the -=
ve side) to show the batery is being drained, turn the light on and it defl=
ects further.
When the engine is running the volt meter should read between 12 and 15 vol=
ts often marked by a green band on the gauge. It would be normal for the va=
lue to rise within this range as the battery is recharged post starting. Ab=
ove that and you have a regulator fault, below that a battery fault as abov=
e. The Ampmeter will now deflect the other way to indicate the the battery =
is charging, as the battery accepts charge it will return to the zero posit=
ion. If it stays deflected to the + side then you have a charging problem -=
 possibly a dead cell in the battery causing a short circuit. If after the =
battery is fully charged and the ampmeter read zero and you turn some thing=
 on (eg headlights) and the needle deflects to the -ve side (it would be no=
rmal for a momentary flicker while the regulator responds to the change in =
load) then you are drawing more amps then is being supplied by the alternat=
or and you need to turn something off in order to prevent a flat battery or=
 the alternator is not producing its full capacity of charge. Remember that=
 the ampmeter does not tell you how meny amps you are using but tells you t=
he rate at which your battery is being charged/discharged (except for the s=
tarter motor current which does not pass through the gauge as at about 250 =
to 350 amps its beyond the range of the gauge!)

Good luck

&gt; mornin dubers,
&gt;=20
&gt;     ok here's the deal, I just got an AWESOME new job but its 50 miles aw=
ay
&gt; (40 highway, 10 city)
&gt; My '78 bus, is loven the high way miles, not to mention all the attention
&gt; she gets... ;)
&gt; I've picked up some gauges to help me &quot;keep my fingers on her pulse&quot; but =
now
&gt; that I have them I realize that I have no bases for what the numbers
&gt; mean.....
&gt; the gauges I have are:
&gt;=20
&gt; autometer oil temp / using a VDO dipstick sender
&gt; VDO volt meter
&gt; Stewart Warner amps gauge
&gt; VDO oil pressure (not in yet, waiting on sender)
&gt; Sun Super Tach II Mini - Model #CP7908 8k RPM (not  in yet)
&gt; biding on an autometer cylinder head temp gauge
&gt;=20
&gt; so the question is:
&gt; what are Ideal readings
&gt; and what are the oh S*%$ readings????
&gt;=20
&gt; Thanks in advance
&gt;=20
