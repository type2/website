Hi Rob,

I'm shamelessly hijacking your post to promote Buses of the Corn.

This week's BOTC update will now remind everyone how cool it is to camp 
with the people you read posts from but have yet to meet in the flesh. 
And we have some real net celebrities coming this year:

Hard-Core campers: The people who run  EveryBus, Dixie Bus Gathering, 
BusFusion, Buses By The Falls and John Brown's Buses will be there. We 
might also get an appearance from the &quot;Buses By The Mill&quot; folk as well. 
If you wanna know more about a campout there is no better way to learn 
it than to ask the guy in charge, and the people who have been there.

Did I mention that members of the Buskatiers, the Full Moon Bus Club, 
The Ohio Valley Tribe of the FMBC and The Bug Pack will be in 
attendance? I wonder which club will take home the best bus driver 
award?

If you're still reading and you need to know more about the eventt, 
It's August 6th - 8th, 2004 in Whitby Ontario Canada.

Happy trails,

&gt; I am wondering if anyone on the list has ever gone to VWoA in Auburn 
&gt; Hills,
&gt; Michigan! Do they have  museum open to the public and is it regular 
&gt; hours!!
&gt; Looking for day trips on our 15 day Canadian outing, Eh! Going to try 
&gt; and
&gt; take a ferry with our busses across on of those big lakes...Lake 
&gt; Michigan
&gt; maybe!  Hopefully no Edmond Fitzgerald ride to the bottom!  Also found 
&gt; a
&gt; place where they have world class rapids and they boogie board down 
&gt; them!
&gt; Got see where that is on the map!  Going to go look at some fog light 
&gt; houses
&gt; on the edge of the great lakes!  Looking for suggestions leaving from 
&gt; Omaha
&gt; on July 24th North to Canada over some lakes to Detroit area back to 
&gt; Canada
&gt; and than Niagara and Busses of the Corn!  Have to be at work the 
&gt; Tuesday
&gt; after the campout so Aug 8th, Sunday and Aug 9th, Monday will be long
&gt; driving days across Iowa, Illinois, and Michigan!  Going to be adding 
&gt; to my
&gt; State magnets and now I guess I will have to find country magnets also!
