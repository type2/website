&gt; So I'm surfing the Colorado state website and discover that Denver has

Is that Denver proper only?  Or does it apply to the whole county / 
surrounding area?

&gt; Has anybody in that area experienced this test on an old ACVW and have
&gt; any problems passing it?

My brother-in-law lives in Denver.  The times I've been out to visit, I 
have not seen very many ACVWs on the road, but that might be more of an 
artifact of road salt than smog rules.
