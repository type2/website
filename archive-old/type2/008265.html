&gt; .  Am I just unskilled or unlucky, or a carburetors
&gt; tempermental things that are difficult to set straight once they are
&gt; messed up?

&gt; 
Mark,
I believe that this is just the luck of the draw on carburetors.  I rate my
mechanic skills as only slightly above average but have had great luck with
all of the carburetors I've rebuilt.  My first experience was out of
neccesity because all of the VW mechanics I talked to refused to rebuild my
31 pict because they couldn't guarantee it.  I think they just wanted to
sell me a new one.  Mine was rebuilt on my coffee table with q-tips and
acetone for cleaning.  It only took an hour and worked like new.  I've
rebuilt several since then and only had trouble with a Holley on my
Subu**an.  I think, however, that I owe my success to the fact that I
rebuild at the slightest hint of trouble instead of waiting for them to lay
down completely.  It's cheap, easy, and quick (just like some of my
ex-girlfriends!).

Peace,
Erich Elmer
