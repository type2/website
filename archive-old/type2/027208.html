Hollie,
  A while ago I had to get new tires... a long while ago that is..... I went to
Discount tires and they have what the type II requires
listed in their database.... I am looking at getting some new ones again and
went to Discount and Les Schwabb... both have the type II in their database
and quoted around 130 for 4 tires... also Les Schwabb quated me like 110
for new shocks front and rear which is what I figure i will go with as I have to drive
the I-5 wind tunnel sometimes up by Everett... Both of these outfits give
a warranty on their tires and they will fix your flats for free... I like em!

                                 Good luck,  Dan Simmons, Renton Wa.
                                 1974 Type II &quot;Gunter&quot; 
Anyway, I'm very very open to suggestions about what the best tire/wheel
setup would be. I'm going to have the wheels probably forever, and so I want
lots of different ideas and opinions to work from. I'll probably be buying
them on Thursday afternoon from Discount Tire, here in Seattle. Another
place someone mentioned liking was Les Schwabb. Price is a factor, but since
I have no idea how much these things will cost I'm not sure how much of a
factor it will be.
