Subject: FogLight Placement w/overriders

Hello,
I currently have front overriders on my 72 bus (68-72 bumper type).  My tire 
is also front mounted.  My spare mount is abit different; it attaches to the 
front at 3 points.  It is the type that mounts low.  One bolt attach to the 
bumper and 2 bolts attach through the nose.  It allows the tire to be mounted 
forward, meaning a tire hub cap can be used in the front. 
My question is where would my fog lights mount, if I was to install them?  
The placement might make the front too &quot;busy&quot;.  Is there a standard mount point? 
 If a member on the list has such a setup, could he/she send me a picture to 
help me decide on a mount. Much thanks.
