Subject: Re: Disc brake servo vacuum

HHhhmmmm!

I've got a similar problem with my '72 bus.
The guy I bought it from told me that he disconnected the vacuum hose
to the Brake vacuum booster, but he didn't tell me where to look for it.
I checked the boost at the brake master cylinder and all the way under
the bus, but I can't find WHERE it plugs in to the engine.
This bus has a single carburetor. Does anyone have a photo or a sketch
of the connection at the engine?

Thanx

&gt; The check valve holds vacuum in the booster circuit. When you accelerate,
&gt; manifold vacuum drops to near zero. Without the check valve, booster vacuum
&gt; would go to near zero and you would loose boost. Also without the valve, you
&gt; would have to wait too long for the vacuum to recover after one use of the
&gt; brakes. With the valve and 15-18&quot; of vacuum, you would have about 3
&gt; applications of the boost after the engine is off. Without the valve, you
&gt; loose vacuum immediately when the engine stops.
