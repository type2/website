Subject: RE: [T2] And now with less power!

David,

You are right, that would cause all sorts of  performance problems, but I am
pretty sure I didn't put it that way.

Just to clarify:

TDC = TOP DEAD CENTER (Mark corresponding to Zero on the pulley)
BTDC = BEFORE TOP DEAD CENTER (Marks corresponding to numbers located
counter-clockwise on the pulley)
ATDC = AFTER TOP DEAD CENTER (Marks corresponding to numbers located
clockwise on the pulley)

You quoted me as saying, &quot;the motor is timed at 28 degrees
Before-Top-Dead-Center all the time&quot;. The motor wouldn't run at that setting
(it won't even run at the recommended 7.5 degrees BTDC at idle). 28 degrees
BTDC would cause the spark to ignite much too early and the resulting
combustion-pressure would stop the progress of the piston from reaching
Top-Dead-Center and the motor would not run. Essentially the motor would
&quot;fight&quot; itself.

As for my motor, the idle timing is 7.5 degrees After-Top-Dead-Center at 800
RPM (Revolutions per minute). The centrifugal advance works like it should
and progresses the timing to 28 degrees After-Top-Dead-Center at 3000 RPM.
The Vacuum advance only advances a couple of degrees further when attached,
which is supposed to be &quot;normal&quot; on this particular distributor until it
breaks in.

&quot;Sounds to me like you have BTDC and ATDC confused... possible?

Regardless, if you are not getting any advance and are seeing 28 degrees 
BTDC all the time, it's no wonder your engine feels sluggish.  When the 
advance kicks in, I suspect your power will return.
