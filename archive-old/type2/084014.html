Subject: Wipers and headlight woes

Hello listees, can't wait to see you all at Everybus!  Prudence just
came home from the body shop and looks very shiny and happy; they really
did a great job.  But now there are two problems stumping us:  the
wipers do not turn on even tho we can hear the motor running, they
worked prior to going into the shop but it will be a pain to drag her
back there if we can fix it ourselves.  Also, I have no low beams.  High
beams work fine-where do we start to look to fix this?   Thanks in
advance for your advice!  LOVE, Beth and Prudence the newly painted 78
bus.
