Subject: Re: keeping engine cooler

Re heat output, its removal, and power-  -a car going 40mph up a steep hill
vs 40 on the flats HAS to be putting out more power/min- but we can look at
the cooling this way:
1. a low throttle in a lower gear with high rpm's vs  2.a high throttle in
a higher gear with lower rpm's (haulin' that hill) - since more heat output
must come from gas burning than from cylinder friction, and since the fan's
work is better at high rpm's,  drivin' it floored up that hill at 2000
rpm's vs hunkering down in a lower gear (and not exceeding 3,500 rpm) is
the way to go if you want those heads to last!    Now if you compare
floored in 4th vs HIGH rpm's in 3rd to  get same speed (40), I'll still bet
a cooler engine in the lower gear, because while common sense tells me the
&quot;work done&quot; to  achieve this speed on the same hill must be the same, the
fan must remove the heat better at high rpms- as David Sch. cyl. head
readings have shown.
