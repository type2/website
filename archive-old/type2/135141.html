Subject: Battery

I'm in need of a new battery and would like some feedback.

 

My research indicates that the VW Bus calls for a Group Type 41 battery. . .
I'd like to get a Costco branded battery (cost &amp; warranty) - but it appears
as thought they don't sell a type 41.  They do sell a group type 47 (I have
that in my BMW Bavaria - a six cylinder - so far a great battery at a good
price) - it is smaller than the type 41 though.

 

Any thoughts on group size, CCA, ah, brand, etc.?

 

TIA

 

Wayne
