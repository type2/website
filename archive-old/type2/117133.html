Subject: Removing the pulley.

On Ashley's Type 1 engine, how do I remove the back half of the pulley ?
The front half normally comes off OK but the back stays put. I assume there
is some kind of clever fixing ?

I need to remove it as the front bearing on the alternator needs greasing
and the pulley has been painted at some point so needs stripping and
cleaning to fit in my nice clean engine bay :-)

Suggestions gratefully received. In fact if you have an effective technique
for pulley removal and belt replacement that is better than my &quot;jam a
screwdriver in so it locks the pulley and then undo the nut&quot; trick, I'm
sure everyone will be keen to hear it. I'm sure what I'm doing isn't right
but it works. Doesn't stop me wanting to do it better though.

Phil
