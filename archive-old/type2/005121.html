Subject: Re: [T2] fi to carbs on 78 2.0l??

I am at a loss for words for this reply......
Do you know what the E in EFI stands for?
Electronic Fuel Injection.
Without the double relay and the engine harness, EFI will not run. They are as
much a part of EFI as a camshaft is to an engine.


&gt; &gt; &gt;.....lots of bad
&gt; &gt; &gt; memories and what have I realized?  I have NEVER had the K-jetronic fuel
&gt; &gt; &gt; injection on any of my VW's ever bring me to a halt.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the past 7 years I have had two EFI failures that brought me to a halt.
1st
&gt;
&gt; neither one was a FI problem both were electrical
&gt;
&gt; &gt; one was a double relay that gave up. 2nd happened on the way to Jerome 2
weeks
&gt;
&gt; a double relay is still needed in a carb engine (fuel pump shut off if
&gt; engine stops)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ago = lost injector power because of the harness failure. I did not cut the
&gt;
&gt; wiring harness failure will shut down any engine, just happened to be the
&gt; wire to the injectors
