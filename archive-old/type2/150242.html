Good Volks -

As I was rubber-malloting the snot out of my T1 case to crack that
oyster open, I thought &quot;there must be a better way&quot;. So I sat down next
to the monster and had an ice cold one... then two... &quot;Leverage&quot;,
methinks to mineself... then the Budweiser faerie touched my crown with
the wand-o-knowledge. Now, if you've heard it before, don't give away
the ending.

1) Take a turnbuckle ($2 at OSH) with the &quot;O&quot;s on both ends, e.g:

O///[[[[[[]]]]]]\\\O

that starts at about 6 inches and lengthens from there, and...

2) Use the bottom tranny mount studs to slowly separate that puppy. Two
quarter twists, and the job's done.

I've never seen a case come apart so smoothly and controlled. For those
cases with the universal T2 moustache bar mounts, a couple bolts in
there will do the front. But by the time the FiF (tranny studs) come
apart, a simple tap on the RiR side is all that's needed.

Just wanted to come out of hibernation long enough to share that with
y'all. Gotta go unsubscribe and get back to work, work, work!

Enjoy the &quot;Visket Case-Splitter&quot;.

Mike
