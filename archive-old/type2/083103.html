Subject: Engine Weirdness

Hello All:

This is an odd one.  First, some background.  Last summer I built a new eng=
ine for my 71 bus, and it's been running well for about 5K miles.  In the l=
ast few months, it's been losing a little oil, which I attributed to leakin=
g push rod tube seals.  I had to add a quart of oil about every 250-300 mil=
es.  In the last couple weeks, I noticed my oil pressure was dropping to ab=
out 20-30 PSI on the freeway, where it was about 50 PSI normally.  The funn=
y thing was, my oil level was OK.  Last night, on the freeway, my oil press=
ure was only about 20 PSI.  Suddenly, the tone of my engine changed, gettin=
g quieter, and there was a corresponding loss of power.  My first thought w=
as that a spark plug wire came loose, and I was running on less than 4 cyli=
nders.  When I got home, I looked at the wires, and they were all attached.=
  With the engine running, I pulled each spark plug wire, one at a time, to=
 see if that would make a difference.  It turns out that wires 1 and 3 made=
 no difference in the running of the engine, but 2 and 4 each made the engi=
ne sputter and run rough.  This would indicate that 1 and 3 are not firing,=
 but there's a spark going to all 4 cylinders.  A little more back ground: =
 I used 88mm slip-in P &amp; C's, which I found out later are highly not recomm=
ended, since the cylinder walls are so thin that they'll eventually warp.  =
Could this be what has happened in this instance???

As usual, all help, advice, opinions, laughter, are appreciated.
