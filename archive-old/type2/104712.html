Subject: Re: [T2] NAPA  ball joint snafu

.....
.....

All I can add is, NEVER USE NAPA for VW parts or service. The only things I 
get at NAPA are lubricants and supplies. I can't tell you how many times 
I've seen poor fit of NAPA parts and just bad services on ALL Euro cars at 
NAPA. Things like, 4 quart oil change special in a motor that takes 7 
quarts, and a dead motor in 50 miles. That's what you get for $19.95, a 
$3.00 filter and 3 quarts short of a full load. And 10/30 oil and a junk 
filter and valve lifters wrattling like crazy. Put on a stock filter with 
proper oil weight=problem solved. I don't know if they have the specs and 
don't care to look them up, or don't have specs cause everything the parts 
man sells they think meets spec. Nerds, I tell you, just nerds, worth half 
the $8 per hour they are paid, except when you add up the damages.

&gt;Her NAPA machinist is having a hard time.
&gt;He says it's the &quot;worst&quot; set he's ever done.
&gt;I'm thinking she misunderstood, and he
&gt;actually said it's the &quot;first&quot; set he's ever done.
&gt;I've suggested she take a Bentley to the store
&gt;and request to see the tools required.
