Subject: Re: [T2] pilot bearing problem?

William,

Your problem sounds like it might well be pilot bearing related.  If it
is, you must pull the engine to get access.  If you do it, it will cost
you less than $10 for a new pilot bearing. If you bring it to a shop, it
will cost $200, $150 to pull and put the engine, less than $10 for the
part and $40 for labor.  Up to you :-)

Replacement is not a hard job...  On a T1 engine, you replace the gland
nut which incorporates the bearing.  On a T4, you pop the old bearing out
and push the new one into the end of the crank.  There are lots of tips in
the library on doing this and on pulling the engine.
