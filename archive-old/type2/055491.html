Subject: Ashley's Restoration and an idea

Well I've been to see Ashley my Van and very sad he looks too. Most of the rust
has ben cut out and one of the sills is back in. The bodyshop are ordering
panels now. 

Now his spare wheel lives on the front and where it was the is a big &quot;smile&quot; of
surface rust (I think he looks happy because he is going to be fixed up) but I
wondered if there was a way around this with the wheel staying on the &quot;nose&quot;. I
thought maybe some half inch spacers between the front pannel and the bracket ?
but would this cause stress to the front panel ? Don't want the wheel inside the
van as I want the space and think it's a useful safetly feature to have it
between me &amp; a crash.
Anyone any had any experience fitting spacers here ?

Thanks - as long as no one minds I keep you posted over the next few weeks on
the work.

P.S. Went to on the train the other day, got out at the station and what pulls
up, a camper exactly the same age as mine ! Couple who owned it had had it from
new and it was in very good condition but unrestored I think (they were in a
hurry &amp; couldn't chat). At least I took some photo's and decided on the rear
wheel arches to be fitted to Ashley.
