&gt; So I guess that was/is the dust cover. And I should put it back on.

You sure should, though I've worked on plenty that had the dust cover
missing.  But as long as you got it... :-)

&gt; For the first time do-it-yourselfer, this is NOT as easy as I would like it 
&gt; to be.  I. e.; Mike Benthin said to rotate the nut on the alternator CLOCK 
&gt; WISE.  The Haynes says the rotation of the rotor is CLOCK WISE.  I think, 
&gt; but I am NOT sure, that this is incongruous.  

No, that's right.  Clockwise all around.  As the alternator turns
clockwise the crankshaft turns clockwise which would turn the camshaft
counterclockwise (since camshaft is directly gear-linked to the
crankshaft, it HAS to turn counterclockwise) and then the distributor
drive gear turns the distributor shaft clockwise.  

The Volvo you sold me, on the other hand, has the distributor shaft turn
counterclockwise when the engine is rotated clockwise.  That messed with
my head for a little while because I was used to the VW way.  Just a
different distributor drive gear.


&gt;ALso, is it just as easy to 
&gt; replace the points, as long as I am going to set the dwell  (SURE, you all 
&gt; say!!  But remember, this is the first time I am doing this.   Do I have the 
&gt; courage to actually pull the points and set the dwell in one step?  The 
&gt; points were (professionally) replaced last summer, but the previous points 
&gt; had been in the vehicle 4-5 or more years, with over 40K miles on them.  PO 
&gt; kept meticulous records, better than me!!)
&gt;

Well it is just as easy to replace the points, since setting the dwell
correctly is the hardest part of it.  The trick to replacing the points is
to not drop that little screw that holds the points down.  A magnetic
screwdriver or magnet on a stick works well for that.

Points and condenser should both be replaced together every 10,000 miles.
That said, I have often gone MUCH farther than 10,000 miles on a set of
points, but I carry a spare too :-)
 
&gt; Anxiety sets in when I am trying to make sure the little foot is at the TOP 
&gt; of a lobe.  Is it really at the top, or should I tweak-twist the alternator 
&gt; nut one way or the other?  

Best way to figure it is to get your head in the engine room and look
down at
the shaft straight on.  It's hard in the Bus engine compartment but you'll
get it.  Just eyeball it the best you can and you'll be close enough.

&gt; I have an NOS Bosch blister pack, with rotor, points and condenser.  Should 
&gt; I replace the condenser too??  Heck, the blister pack is only 7 to 10 bucks, 
&gt; if I can find it again!!

Yes, you should replace points and condenser together, but replacing the
condenser on a Type 4 FI Bus generally involves removing the distributor
due to the location of the condenser.  It's really just about impossible
to replace the condenser with the distributor in.  Removing the
distributor is very easy provided you don't turn the engine over while the
distributor is out.  It also makes replacing the points at the same time a
lot easier too :-)

Most parts stores will have the points and condenser set for a Bus as the
VW points and condensers cross quite a few models.  Also, if you look in
the RMMW catalog there is an ignition page which lists all the
distributors, what models they came on, and what the Bosch numbers for the
points and condenser are.  With those Bosch numbers you should be able to
get the points and condenser from any competent Bosch retailer.  The Bosch
number is a 5-digit number like 01 111.

The rotor is also easy to find nowadays, and I wouldn't bother with the
$40 rev-limiting rotor unless you drag race your Bus :-)  The regular
cheap non-rev-limiting model will work just fine.

But then you absolutely have to have a timing gun to reset the timing when
you reinstall the distributor.  And really you absolutely have to have a
timing gun when adjusting the points anyway.

Hope this helps,
