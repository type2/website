Subject: 71 bus 1600cc dual port connecting rod

Engine was making a horrible knocking,
pulled the heads and barrels, connecting
rod #4 has too much play.

I removed the connecting rod.  one of the
bearing halves managed to float between
the crank and the connecting rod, and is
doubled up with the other bearing half.

removed the bearing halves.  they were
stuck pretty good.

I have a spare 1600.  I pulled one of the
connecting rods off it.  311b is how it
is marked.  The same marking as the
rod that had a bearing go bad.

put the &quot;new&quot; one in, and it has too much
play.  in and out (direction of piston travel)
a few thousandths.  side to side (front/ rear
of engine) has more play than the others.

I guess the bearing in the &quot;new&quot; rod isn't
thick enough?
