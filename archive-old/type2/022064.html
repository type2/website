Subject: Aargh- accidentally deleted!!
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hey
   A few days ago, someone posted news about a VW swap in Indiana on 
Saturday? I must have deleted it- can someone please send info again?   P 
mail perhaps, so as not to fill up list?
   Many thanks, want to attend tomorrow, not sure where?
