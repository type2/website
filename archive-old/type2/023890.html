Subject: Dual battery setup
Message-ID: &lt;6DE1D809032CD111B29C002035E72D48012321A8_at_MPNTSYDNEY05&gt;

	Hi all,

	Well since there are some questions on batteries etc I thought I'd
post 
	some details on my dual battery setup, it was cheap and very
effective
	I've posted earlier but it's now been in the Bus for about 6 months
and
	works so well I thought an update was due.

	First some background, I run my Bus offroad a lot, and I run it hard
	in mud, sand whatever I can't afford a stall and not be able to
restart
	since I normally stall when I'm close to getting stuck :(, I also
needed 
	plenty of power for lighting and I like to have the cd player
pumping out
	some tunes (normally some kiddie cd to keep the rugrats happy)

	Anyway, since my engine bay had plenty of room (non standard engine)
	I installed a deep cycle battery, it runs a fridge, two 100w
spotlights,
	the stereo and CB as well as some 12v points for my air pump (I run
the
	tires low on the sand and 235/75/15's take a long time to fill) It's
soon to
	run the interior lights and a few other bits and pieces, basically
anything
	that may get used for long periods of time while I'm camped.

	To do all this I installed a fuse box from an RV store up front, and
used this
	as the new contact point for all the accesories.  I then ran a
single cable
	(8GA) to the rear of the Bus.  The second battery connects to a dual
battery
	gadget I bought in kit form from an Autralian store called Jaycar,
this isolates
	the main battery until the engine is running and the voltage it
holds is above a
	preset point, it then connects the second battery and charges it.
The thing I
	really like about this kit is it has lights to show the charge rate
and if the main
	battery is holding a lower voltage than the auxilary battery it'll
connect both
	batterys together for starting, kinda like automatically jump
starting yourself.

	Anyway, one of my websites has a wiring diagram
http://www.baja_dot_com/kombi
	goto the tech page and select electrics and here's the website that
I bought the
	kit from http://www.jaycar_dot_com.au go to catalogue, kits, automotive
and check
	out KA1782, it works great and I've had afull charged starting
battery every time
	since it went in.

	Hope this helps someone
	Cheers
	Steve
