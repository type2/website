Subject: Re: Door seal replacement

Bill,
Just finished doing this myself.  3M makes an adhesive remover that is fairly 
kind to paint.  I've also used acetone but that tends to make the paint a bit 
sticky.  Whatever you do don't do the propane torch thing after you use these 
products.


Good luck,

Don
