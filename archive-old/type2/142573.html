Subject: Hydraulic Stickers

When I painted my fan shroud I decided to carefully remove the  
hydraulic adjustment sticker from it. While it was off I reproduced  
it with Chuck Luce's help.

Original:

If you are not familiar with the sticker it reminds your mechanic  
that your engine has hydraulic lifters and does not require the  
typical valve adjustment.

Another benefit is that the left panel of the sticker depicts how  
hydraulic lifters prevent the head of the valve from falling off. :)

Anybody want one? It cost the same to make 48 as it did to make 1 so  
I figured I'd offer the rest to Type2 folks for $2.50/ea via Paypal  
including S/H.

The stickers are printed on vinyl which is rated to 225F and is oil  
resistant so they should last many years like the original.
