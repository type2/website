 I am seeking your advice on what to do and in what
 order regarding my son's
 new project.
 the bus he obtained had been sitting for about 3-4
 years.
 I was able to get it running by cleaning the points
 and replacing the
 battery.
 I know I need to replace the cap, rotor, wires,
 plugs and change the oil.
 There was no gas in the tank when we got it.
 The inline electric fuel pump works.
 I will also change the fuel filter and the fuel
 lines.
 
 What else do I need to consider changing or
 servicing.
 
 Also, what is the size of screw that holds the
 points in the distributor?
 The hole is stripped out and I am trying to figure
 out how to remedy that.
 bigger screw, lock washer, lock-tite??
 any thoughts

What year is it??

Best fix for a stripped points screw is to replace the
breaker plate with a good used one.

What is the dist number on the side of the housing?
