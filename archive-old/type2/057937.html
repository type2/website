Hey Travis....

Don't be too afraid of the fuse/electrical system.  It may look like a
rat's nest, but really isn't terribly hard to follow.  The only problem is
getting to it.  I just found this out in two ways.  First, I installed an
oil temp gauge as you're doing via a dipstick sender.  Which is
essentially the same wiring procedure.  Secondly, I had some broken female
push on connectors from my ignition switch at the fuse box.  This provided
me with my first look at the fuseblock on my '71.  And the PO made no
bones of stuffing wires in what appears to be an absolutely nonsensical
wiring order.  

I will assume that you can run the wires from the sender to the gauge and
to a ground.  There are five posts on the back of your gauge (there were
on mine).  Two groups:  Two posts on top for the light, and three at
the bottom of the back of the gauge for the power to the gauge.  The lower
group of three has a push on for the sender, a push on for the ground, and
a push on for the power.  The first two are easy.  The power wire needs to
have a constant power source, like the lights, the ignition switch, etc.
I'm not sure how different the fuse block is on a 79 vs a 71, so I'm a bit
leery of suggesting which wire/fuse to wire into.  When I installed my
gauge, I used a wire splicer that I got from the hardware store.  It's a
blue piece of plastic that clamps around the wire you want to splice
into.  Basically the new wire and the hot wire a run parallel to each
other and are connected by a piece of splicing metal that is inside the
plastic piece.  Go to the hardware store and ask for this piece, and it
will be very obvious.

The other thing (more tedious but more professional) would be to run a
wire with a female push on right to the &quot;hot&quot; part of the fuse block.
Both ways give your gauge a constant power supply, regardless of whether
your bus is on or off.

I would use 12 gauge wire for any power wires.  Granted, this gauge
probably doesn't need much juice, but a lower gauge is never a problem,
and a higher gauge can be.  As a matter of fact, I used 12 gauge for the
whole install, which doesn't matter, but some might say is overkill:). 

So now you have power to your gauge. The ground is done in the same
example as all the other grounds underneath your dash.  Have a look at one
and mock it.  

As for the light on the gauge, I spliced right into the power for my
speedometer light, using the same splicing piece.  That way the gauge is
dimmed/brightened along with the other lights on the dash.  The ground is
again, very simple.

&gt; (2) I also picked up one of those single-hole rubber &quot;safety brackets&quot; to
&gt; mount in.  I was thinking of putting it under the dash.  Has anyone ever
&gt; used some type of velcro setup to successfully connect the bracket to the
&gt; underside of the dash?  Any other non-drilling approaches?

I imagine velcro would work, depending on how well it stuck to the dash
and the gauge.  I did mount my gauge with screws drilled into the lower
lip of the dash (at my right knee).  It's sturdy and looks fine.  I
figure that what you're installing is going to be an integral part of the
bus for the life of the bus, so why not mount it permanently?  No worries
and it looks fine.  

Let me know if you have any other questions or need clarification on
anything.  Good luck.
