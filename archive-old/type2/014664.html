&gt; Subject: [T2] VW Gas Fired Heaters-Was staying warm
&gt; 
&gt; I have heard of these VW Aux gas fired heaters, but I was hearing that
&gt; they are too dangerious.  Who knows how educated my source was on these
&gt; items, but...  I would be interested in hearing more about these.
&gt; 
	[Crick, Bill ]  My bus has a gas heater. Its basically a small
furnace under the bus inline with
	the heater ducts. 25years old. Works fine. Hasn't blown up yet! 
	It will heat the bus up hotter than you want
	when the outside is -25F. It has a thermostat control allowing you
to vary the output. 
	If you turn it up full blast in the fall, the defroster will almost
singe your
	eyebrows. It uses about a quart of gas/hr according to the spec if I
remember it right.

	You can run it with the engine off , and it has a timer feature so
you can nip out, and turn it on 10 minutes 
	before you are going to leave, and get into a warm bus, or leave it
on while you go into a store.
	It gets some weird looks when its sitting there in a parking lot
going Whiirrrrrr Tick tick tick tick, roar.
	with the engine off, and no one in it;-) The Whirr is the fan. the
tick tick is the ignition system, and
	the rooar is the noise of the fire.

	I think the model number is BA-6? I forget the company - Stewart
Warner, or Esberachere or something.
