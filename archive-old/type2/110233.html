&lt;&lt; Why does other company (mostly American I have to say) care about doing 
some economical and environment friendly car and truck. Europe and Asia 
produce small economical car, why not here, don't tell me America is too 
big and we need big car because we have to travel greater distance... &gt;&gt;

As the CEO of Bechtel once said, &quot;We're not in the construction business. 
We're in the business of making money.&quot; Same goes for the auto industry.
If an auto company thinks it can make a greater profit with a more econom-
ical car...They'll make them. Right now, SUV's are the BIG profit makers, due
to various factors; including legislation, production costs, and that all 
impor-
tant consideration, 'perception'. Big cars/SUV's have an image of safety and
the ol' Ned Buntline 'Mine's bigger'n yours' attitude...VW would probably like
it if more people thought 'Phaeton' rather than Beetle when they thought of
VW. Same as the rest of the industry...
