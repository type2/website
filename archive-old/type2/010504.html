To correct others spelling. Or to tell others not to abuse the mail list when
you just have.

&gt;I have to do this or I will go insane. I have stood it beyond endurance.

&gt;It's &quot;kharma&quot;. K-H-A-R-M-A. Not &quot;karma&quot;. Stop spelling it like that. &gt;Please
please stop.

&gt;&quot;Gauge&quot;. &quot;Definitely&quot;. Okay, I'll stop. But if you are going to withold
kharma from one another, or pass it around, or whatever you do with it, for
God's sake spell it right.

&gt;Comments by pmail only! Thanks.
