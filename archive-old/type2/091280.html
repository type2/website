Subject: Re: [T2] Magfire electronic ignition???

I  would have a discussion with the FLAPS that cant read  not compufire
on  that one.
&gt; jimt
-------------------------
I had that discussion and it amounted to &quot;We'll send it back for you&quot; and
I just kept standing there demanding my money back (less than 48 hours
after I bought it).
I'll promise you one thing, I've wasted Compufire and the FLAPS to
everybody that I discuss VW's with.
That crap has to have cost them several thousand dollars as it should.
If you lucked out ........ good going.
