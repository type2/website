&gt;not gonna get great milage on the rebuild...but what should i expect?
&gt;
&gt;everything is timed and accurate, valves set to .006, carb set correctly, new
&gt;points, etc etc. i've never got good milage on this van. even before the
&gt;rebuild.
&gt;
&gt;it is my understanding that with dual carbs i'll get better milage and more
&gt;power. how much, i'm not sure. so, should i go to dual or try a different
&gt;single carb...or does mine need rebuilding?
&gt;

I also have a '74 1800 and over the years have gone from stock carbs to a
single Weber and now back to a setup that is similar to the stock dual carb
setup (Brosol Solex carbs). In my opinion, these buses run best with the
stock dual-carb/stock distributer setup. On the other hand I probably put
100K miles on the bus with the single Weber. 18 mpg is about average mileage
for city/mixed driving, though you should do a bit better on the highway
driving a steady 55. If you don't have the original carbs, you'll have a
hard time finding any. If your bus runs well with the Weber, I suggest
keeping your eyes open for some '74 carbs and all of the associated
paraphenalia (linkage, air box, etc) and migrating your bus back to stock
setup when you get all of the parts.
