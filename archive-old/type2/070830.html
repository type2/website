Subject: power failure on hill
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I nearing a jumbo hill in my '72 westy w/ dual weber carbs, and so I had it up
to about 70, as soon as i got on the hill, the speed dropped, which i
expected, except it dropped FAST and started shaking, I downshifted into 3rd,
which is usually no problem for a hill, and had the same problem, i then had 8
heart attacks, by then i was at the top of the hill, and decided just to take
it easy and go home.  I know nothing about cars, so I'm hoping maybe I just
had it in too low of a gear, but that wouldn't explain why I got such a huge
power loss when i first started going up the hill.  Oh well, if anyone has any
idea what happend please let me know, things seem to be working okay now.

Shawn
