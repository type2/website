Subject: RE: [T2] Upgrading to H4s

George--
The exact way a long wire with 12 volts hooked up to a battery in back
of the Bus will lose it's exact value by the time it gets to the point
of delivery---unless the diameter or gauge of the wire is increased.

This is the  point I was trying to make in the final delivery of
volts--amps to it's final destination up front in the Bus---you want the
same value as the origin of the power-you have to have sufficiant wire
diameter.
 
It's the same picture I was painting with the welder---If I wanted the
same value that leaves the welding unit--62 ft. away the wire would have
to be in proportion to the distance traveled. 

Thank You.
