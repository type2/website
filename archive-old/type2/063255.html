Subject: Re: HELP WITH YEAR!

&gt;&gt; My brother Danny and I have been working (90% restoed) on a '71 Westphalia
&gt;&gt; Campmobile.
&gt;&gt; Or so we thought. Now we're not so sure it's a 71.
&gt;&gt;...
&gt;&gt; Thing is, we just noticed a Westphalia sticker on a cabinet (previuously
&gt;&gt;covered
&gt;&gt; by old carpeting) that says Campmobile 70.
&gt;
&gt;Biggest clue is whether it has front disk brakes or not.  Disks brakes = '71.
&gt;(Please correct me, anyone, if I'm wrong about this).

        You're right tobin. Easiest method is checking the VIN, located on
the Left Front dash, visible from outside the bus. The first 3 letters tell
you the model and year. 220=1970 transporter, 230=1970 Kombi (upon which
Westy did their thing. 221=1971, etc. Easy to identify busses once you know
the simple scheme. The easiest difference between 68-70 and 71 is the rims.
Newer rims have the circular holes all around the edges of the hubcap.

&gt;
&gt;Could it be possible you have a different interior that what it
&gt;originally came with?  Seems far-fetched to me....  Perhaps westfalia was
&gt;using old '70 westy interiors early in the '71 bus production?  Dunno.

        Possible. Or someone retrowestied it along the way, ala Jonathan's
bus and my bus.

Peace,
