Your on the right track. Don't forget to check for vacuum leaks. Adjust the
valves. Compression test. Then verify spark energy at the gap. Then adjust
mixture. All per Bentley. If the problem remains, only then are you ready
to diagnose the fuel system. Per Bentley, verify fuel pressure and volume.
If that's a bit on the low side, pull the inlet to the fuel filter and
drain some gas out the back. If you see any crud come out, pull the filter
off and blow through it. There should be very little resistance to air flow
after you blow all the gas out of it. Replace it if there is any question.
Then retest fuel pressure and volume. If there still is a problem there,
verify the pressure regulator.

If that resolved low pressure/volume, readjust the mixture.

If that doesn't resolve the problem, then start checking the several items
in the FI system control. Temp sensor, throttle switch (if it has one), by
pass valve, cold start injector, time switch, air flow meter.

&gt;So, my turn to ask for help.
&gt;
&gt;Daisy just isn't running well these days.  I've done the tune up,
&gt;re-checked the specs and she is timed and dwelled
&gt;alright.  The problem is a longer crank for startup and a poor idle
&gt;after.  I sometimes have to start her a few times
&gt;before she stays running and that's with me feathering the
&gt;accellerator.  When the engine is warm, all's good, although it doesn't
&gt;seem to have the power it had.
