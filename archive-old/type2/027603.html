Hi, Steve--

I triggered a thread about engine break-in on the list when I got my new VW 
de Mexico engine the first week of July 1999; the type2 archives should have 
it. Listees contributed a lot of useful data and lore.

To the braintrust as a whole, I have a question I was wondering about: What 
differences, if any, between breaking in a [full] rebuild and breaking in a 
new engine?

thanks
