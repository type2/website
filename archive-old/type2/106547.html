Subject: Re: [T2] rebuild 2.0l

John Connolly wrote: 
 the problem with T-4s is they only have a 1.3:1 rocker ratio, so the
lift IS
 limited on a hydraulic grind to some extent (what's the rocker ratio on
the
 ford?). You'll notice with VW hydraulic grinds the available lifts are
much
 lower then with solids, because they have to be so much milder on the
on/off
 valve seat events with hydraulic lifters, and then you only have 1.3:1
X at
 the valve.
  This does not jive with Karl's assertion that the t2 hydraulic cam is
no different from the nonhydraulic and can add hydralic lifters, as we
did to a top end rebuild of a 75 bus?
