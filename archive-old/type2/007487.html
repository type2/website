Subject: buying parts on net
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Does anyone have any suggestions about buying parts f/people through www.type2_dot_com ads? What is the safest way to exchange the cash for parts if the owner is not close to you? I need my parts, but want to be safe about getting them. Thanks! Alexis '70 camper
