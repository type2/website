	Jack,
	I hate to ask this, have you checked that the cam and
crank-shaft are lined-up? That is, when #1 *piston* is at TDC,
are the valves alternately both open and both closed? 
	Pull the spark plug and use something clean, forgiving and not 
breakable (a heavy nylon tie-wrap works great) to feel for the top
of the piston. Crank the engine around until the piston is at the
top, then look at the valves on that cylinder. Check where the
distributor is pointing. It agrees with the valves, does it agree
with the piston?
	Then crank the piston around once again and check valves and distributor
again.
	Almost certainly this isn't the problem, but since the engine
has been rebuilt, its POSSIBLE that cam and crank don't agree. There
are a lot of teeth on those gears and accidents happen. It takes
three things for a gas engine to run- timing, spark and fuel/air mix.

	Also, not counting starting fluid, etc, if you crank it, do you
smell gas at the tail pipe? If so, you've got a good clue that fuel
and air mixture is getting into the cylinders (and being pumped out).

	My one experience with backfiring was during an ignition fiasco when
our '70s primary wire was intermittantly shorting and then went solidly
bad. During the minute of intermitant operation it backfired, or rather
I think a combustable mixture ignited in the exhaust system. Backfiring-
flame out the carb, sounds to me like spark, valve and piston are not
in complete accord.

	But I sincerely hope its something simpler than that. Usually when
I check wild ideas like this its something much simpler.

	Bill
