Subject: Fuel pump, again?  Why me.

It has just gotten warm enough around here for me to start driving my '72
Westy &quot;Ghetto Cruiser&quot; around with freezing to death.  If anyone remembers, I
had problems with not enough fuel to the engine (1700 pancake, twin weber), i
replaced my mechanical fuel pump and all seemed well (it seemed to be leaking
a tiny bit of oil but i was going to fix that later).  On my way home from
school today cruising at a nice 50mph in 4th gear, that same damn thing
happened, again, lost power, started to buck.  I pulled over, on level, open
up the engine area, sure enough barely any gas could be seen in my fuel
filter, running on good ol' gravity feed again.  The fuel flow seems fine when
i took the gas lines out and had it splash all over my face, new fuel pump,
what is the problem?  Or do I have to replace my fuel pump every 100 miles or
something.

Any help would really be appreciated, the only mechanic that I trust not to
rip me off is 250 miles away in NJ!

Thanks for taking the time to read this painfully long message,
