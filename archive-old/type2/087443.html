&lt;&lt; Ever notice just how many VWs out there have some sort of rigging on them?

Only because you're familiar with VW's...and probably because it can be done.
VW's were plentiful and cheap enough to warrant this sort of repair...My first
VW was $35 (down from $50) and it ran for two years before the front seal
blew. What sorta scares me is the &quot;rigging&quot; that's gonna be done on Kenworth
sized SUV's when they hit the beater price range...Same as a lot of other mod-
ern cars...I would suspect that the electronics/modular construction will pro-
hibit an awful lot of new cars from reaching old age gracefully.
