Subject: Dulles [Va] area: 91 Vanagon FS

Good morning list friends:

&gt;From the W_Post site:  $6000 asking for 1991 Vanagon, 4 speed, silver GL,
2nd owner, 78k miles; said to have very little rust, only a crushed rear
bumper.......  tel#  703 450 9537; addr=  17 Aldridge Court,  new
development 'Countryside' in Sterling.

If anyone on the List would like this vehicle --OR-- if anyone would be
willing to go and look at it, and report his/her findings to the List,  that
would be excellent!!   I spoke to the seller by phone.  My location is ~75
miles away and I will be unable to get out there for the next several days.
The present owner may not be aware the Vanagon engine can require expensive
rebuilding, plus $377 worth of hoses, plus hours of preventive maintenance,
to be a reliable Freeway/Beltway driver.
