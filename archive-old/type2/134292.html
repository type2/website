Subject: Clutch Problem

I have a 68 bus with a stock 1600SP. My clutch has been giving me a problem.
Its like the cable just doesn't pull enough. When I adjust it so there is
enough free play at the end. The clutch doesn't engage enough for me to shift.
When I adjust it enough to engage it enough to shift, the clutch seems to not
disengage to a point where it slips a little. So i have replaced the cable,
bowden tube, throw out bearing, the cross shaft and bushing, the clutch itself
and the spring on the cross shaft. I have not replaced the rear main seal
behind the fly wheel but thats it. So I stumped....If anybody has gone thru
this or can think of something, anything, I would be most
grateful........CHAD
