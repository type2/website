It sounds like 9 out of 10 Wally Marts do allow overnight camping.  Those that don't are on a list found at this site. Maybe you have a new one for their list. http://www.freecampgrounds_dot_com/noparking.htmlRick--- Jeff Stewart  wrote:&gt; &gt; I have heard Wally Mart allows camping in some of&gt; their parking lots but maybe that is just an urban&gt; legend.&gt; &gt; On our way to Everybus this year, Wal Mart security&gt; freaked out when our caravan of 11 buses rolled into&gt; their parking lot! One of our group overheard&gt; security being told to order us off their property!&gt; When we informed them we were there as customers&gt; they lightened up, but I sure wouldn't try to spend&gt; the night in one of their parking lots-although I do&gt; see a lot of big motor homes in the lot of the one&gt; in town.&gt; Jeff Stewart&gt; 1977 Westfalia&gt; 1974 S.
