&gt; See, and that is why you are ONLY a smart-ass. 
&gt; I don't need YOUR info, and
&gt; your posts are not welcome.  You don't read
&gt; well, and you quote even worse.
 
&gt; I was saying that I don't need lectures about
&gt; what kind of car I should own,
&gt; or how I should drive, or that I'll pay for it
&gt; in the end.  I also did not
&gt; say, that I want to &quot;make a reliable bus engine
&gt; that will do what you want
&gt; it to do&quot;.  What I DID say was that I wanted to
&gt; decrease the chances of this
&gt; repeating.  Not eliminate you dense fuck,
&gt; decrease.  

I know you are upset about your engine, so I'll
ignore that.  

It's real hard to assimilate all that your
saying.  It is not financially feasible for you
to buy a later bus w/ 2.0 as someone else
suggested.  It is not financially feasible for
you to buy another vehicle so you can drive like
you used to in your Buick Grand National.  You
also mention that your other car is dead.  I
assume not financially feasible means don't have
the dough.  Nothing wrong with that.  It happens
to us all.  And unfortunately for you, it is
happening at the same time you bus is busted.  

You have an engine that won't turn and you
suspect a dropped valve.  If you don't have the
dough for a later model bus, then you don't have
the dough for a Jake Raby engine (remember you
still have to by lots of stuff to add to his
engine, weber 40's, clutch, exhaust etc. and
adapt the thing if you don't buy type 1).  

So what is your budget? It sounds like not much.
I'd spin balance everything (flywheel, crank
preferably counterweighted, rods, cyl's, fan,
what am I forgetting?).  If I had more cash, I'd
buy a new case and new heads, etc.  I assume LN
pistons and any other nonstock enhancements are
probably out of your budget.  

&gt; There certainly ARE
&gt; things I can do for this to happen, or your
&gt; fellow list mates are liars.
&gt; For that matter Jake Raby is a liar according
&gt; to your statement.  There are
&gt; MANY improvements I can make over stock that
&gt; WILL help me with the way I
&gt; drive my van, I was merely asking the sensible
&gt; list members for their advice
&gt; on the effective ones.  You want to deal out
&gt; parental sounding advice, then
&gt; be a smartass, then try and defend it... 
&gt; here's one you apparently never
&gt; learned.  If you can't say something nice,
&gt; don't say anything at all.

Please don't take any of it personnally.  If you
can buy a Jake Raby engine, then do so.  It's
just that your earlier posts suggested that you
cannot afford it.  

&gt; Yes, part of &quot;busma&quot; is enjoying the ride.  The
&gt; definition of enjoyment is
&gt; different for everyone.  Maybe for me it is
&gt; cruising faster than the average
&gt; busser, maybe for you it is enjoying the
&gt; country highway at 40.  It doesn't
&gt; matter, because it is not the question I asked.
&gt;  One of the fun things about
&gt; VW's in general (and I'm not just a bus owner)
&gt; is that there are so many
&gt; things you can do with them.  The van was built
&gt; over 30 years ago.  What it
&gt; was made to do, and what it can be transformed
&gt; to do now are two different
&gt; universes.  If you don't know anything about
&gt; how to do it, then just shut
&gt; the fuck up and read the next post that you may
&gt; know something about.  I
&gt; never said that I could not afford to upgrade
&gt; it until the end of time, I
&gt; said I could not have a payment car and play
&gt; with both of my VW's at the
&gt; same time.  I don't devote all of money to my
&gt; VW hobby.  I have others, I
&gt; have a life, and I have a family that I like to
&gt; treat.  You should not make
&gt; assumptions or judgments about it being
&gt; practical to throw money into my
&gt; van.  That is why it is mine and not yours. 
&gt; You too easily confuse your
&gt; opinion with helpful information.  You should
&gt; probably try looking at things
&gt; from a direction other than your very narrow
&gt; minded point of view.

Then you need to tell us what your budget is now
if you expect us to tell you what our OPINION is
as to how to enhance your engine while you
rebuild it.  
 
&gt; Since I have made my original post, I was
&gt; reminded of Indian Automotive that
&gt; does a good job of beefing up busses, and have
&gt; also been emailed about
&gt; improvements others have made to get the job
&gt; done.  Your advice is wrong.
&gt; It can be done, you just don't agree with the
&gt; how.

Please, take there advice.  And I will gladly
await your results.  Let us know how long your
new bus lasts. 

&gt; I hope that my continuing to explain things to
&gt; you helps you bite your
&gt; tongue the next time you want to talk down to
&gt; someone from your high horse.
&gt; You should learn to be helpful for real, even
&gt; if it means staying quite.
&gt; You never know when someone is going to stand
&gt; up to reveal they stand far
&gt; above you on your horse.
&gt; 
High horse?  I tell you I've toasted a few
engines and learned to take it easy on them?  I'm
not sure how this is uppity.  

I will watch the list for your posts.  I
excitedly await your efforts to make a type 1
cruise like your Grand National on the interstate
in the Texas heat.  

I would buy an oil temp and cyl head temp guage
no matter how you rebuild the engine.  

Good luck, Ray
