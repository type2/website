That is excellent!  A *HUGE* round of applause for Mr. Cardona and Jeff
&gt;from me!  This kind of devotion and support makes owning a bus much more
than a material thing; it's about being part of a devoted and friendly
community.

Cheers to all!

Mike

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; Just returned from a little voyage from Clarksville TN to Fort Walton Beach
&gt; FL.  Everything was going well until I got about 15 miles from Fort Walton
&gt; Beach.  At that point in time (which was about 3:00 AM), the little noise
&gt; coming from the rear of the bus got really loud and then went completely
&gt; silent.  The bus floated across the road a few times before I managed to get
&gt; her to slide to a stop on the shoulder.  When I got out to see what
&gt; happened, I found that the driver's side rear wheel had come completely off
&gt; the vehicle.  The axle was shredded, cv joint sheared apart, breaks torn to
&gt; pieces, tire blown out, and the back of the bus was resting with the shocks
&gt; on the ground.
&gt; 
&gt; My wife, a friend, two dogs, all of our luggage for the 4-day weekend, and
&gt; myself were now stuck on the side of the road.  Nobody we knew was home, all
&gt; of the garages and tow trucks we called we're still closed and no cab would
&gt; come and pick all of us up (would only pick up to two people and they we're
&gt; willing to do it for the money I had).  And then, the cell phone started
&gt; dying.  So, we set out reflectors, popped the top, and went to sleep
&gt; thinking daylight would bring better news.  Around 6:30 AM we were still
&gt; unable to get in touch with anybody (I spliced the cell-phone power pack
&gt; into the bus - ok, so the wife forgot to bring the cigarette lighter
&gt; adaptor, but wasn't going to make an issue of it right there - You know).
&gt; Finally, just before 7:00 AM, I turned to the last resort and called AIRS
&gt; volunteer Victor Cardona (HUGE ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR MR. CARDONA).  Victor
&gt; was great.  He came right over and picked us all up, drove us all the way
&gt; into Fort Walton Beach over to my wife's friend's house, and even
&gt; recommended a great mechanic.  Thank you so much Victor.
&gt; 
&gt; So, we were finally able to get the bus towed to Little Motors off of
&gt; Highway 98 near Hulbert Field owned and operated by Jeff (Huge plug for
&gt; him - I'll get all the specific data later when I get my other bag back -
&gt; another story).  Jeff was closed for 4th of July, but came in on Monday the
&gt; 3rd since he knew we were from out of town and had to get back to work, took
&gt; an axle from another bus and had our Bess running and ready to go by late
&gt; Monday afternoon.  Also, he got us another tire because he wouldn't let us
&gt; leave without having a spare.  So, he got another axle, fixed the breaks,
&gt; new tire, and all put it all together in perfect working order on his day
&gt; off for people from out of town and charged us less than $100 (We were
&gt; already trying to figure out which one of my organs we were going to have to
&gt; sell to pay for this).  What a guy!!!  Seriously, he did a great job and
&gt; helped us out of a very tough spot.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you so much Mr. Cardona and Jeff from Little Motors.  You guys are
&gt; what makes owning a VW so special.  Also, having the weekend that we did
&gt; (very tough), it was great to see what great people are still out there.
&gt; Great for the soul!
&gt; 
&gt; Thank You so much,
&gt;
