Said Steve:
&gt; 
&gt; There are tents that are designed to work with pickup truck camper shells that
&gt; should work on the rear end of your bus.
&gt; 
&gt; There was a tent offered many years ago that extended the sleeping area inside
&gt; your bus out the rear hatch.

The &quot;rear-ender&quot; tent that Dan Soiney has is like this latter style -
sort of like the &quot;tent&quot; part of a popup camping trailer.  Do you have a
source for these, Steve - even though they're pricey?

Pickup truck styles I've seen are a regular ground tent with a boot to
the truck bed &amp; capper combo -- climb from the tent into your bed in the
truck bed.  IMO that wouldn't make sense with a bus.

The Soiney Model (tm) is just an extension to the rear luggage platform
- mainly for those without Z-beds.

&gt; Why stick in on the rear, when you can slide one on the side?

BOTH, man!  You need BOTH!  PLus one of those rooftop luggage rack
models (for the poptop-deleted crowd).  A cool design would be something
that extended your poptop area out over the luggage rack.  For myself, I
prefer the ultimate tent:
