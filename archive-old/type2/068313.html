Subject: Re: CV joint question

A small tear I've fixed temporararily by cleaning it real well, and with
needle tip on grease gun, pumped it full. Then cleaned boot surface
(including solvent like acetone) and slathered silicone calk over crack.
Wait for it to set overnite, then wrap it well with garbage bag and tape it
to axle and tightly around the cv outside.  If you can keep the dirt out,
will last a long time- have used same method on torn ball joint seal, which
has gone  at least 35k that way so far.........
