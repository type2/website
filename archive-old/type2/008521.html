Subject: Bleeding Hydraulic Clutch - Part 2
Date: Fri, 5 Mar 1999 20:56:59 -0600

Hi Volks,

Well, I went out to bleed the clutch like I had planned (82 Westy).  First
I got up under the old girl and had my buddy actuate the clutch pedal to
make sure that I didn't have a linkage problem - the slave cylinder moved
like it should, just not much travel.  I then undid the bleeder nipple and
had the clutch depressed and out came some dirty fluid.  I then closed the
nipple, had my friend let the pedal up and had him depress it again.

This is where I am stumped.  The pedal went to the floor with no
resistance.  Seemed like there was no fluid in the lines.  I then unscrewed
the line at the bottom of the master cylinder to see if it had fluid.  Only
a few drops came out.  I then checked the line between the resevior and the
master cylinder to make sure it wasn't stopped up (it isn't).  I then put
everything back together (braided hose sucks!) and tried the pedal again
with the same results.

At this point I remembered some responses to my original question that said
the fluid should just run out of the bleeder nipple at the slave cylinder
due to gravity.  I tried that and even tried sucking on the tube connected
to the bleeder nipple (brake fluid sucks!) but only turned blue in the face
and could draw nothing (where's Monica when you need her?).

So here I am.  Am I correct in assuming at this point that my problem is
with the master cylinder?  Why pressure on the first stroke but none now (I
put the end of the bleeder nipple hose in fluid and could tell that no air
or fluid came out)?  Why can't I siphon the fluid through the system if
it's supposed to just run out because of gravity?

Many TIA,
Erich Elmer
