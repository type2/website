Subject: Dual batteries?

Hi all,
Wondering if anyone has a good method of running dual
batteries on a T2? Ive heard several different ways
including buying or making you own switching device
that regulates the charging and use of both batteries.
I'm not much of an electrical guy so help me out here.
Is it worth the trouble? Like I've said earlier I plan
to live in my bus and would be using lights, a laptop,
and possibly a couple of other small devices, not sure
what the amp draw on everything would be. Any ideas
welcome. 
   On a different note I was thinking for names my bus
could be christened &quot;Fartilda&quot; any objections?
Thanks, peace,
Giles

1978 T2
