Subject: Re: in-dash fans for 68-78 bus

Aaah-haa-haa! I found some small fans for cheap on the American Science
&amp; Surplus site
http://www.sciplus_dot_com/recommend.cfm?recommendid=3850&amp;jump=new%2Ecfm
Maybe they could be cobbled in? Or are they too big?

&gt; I crossed the Rio yesterday to check on the fans...
&gt; 
&gt; 211 959 113 C  Fan
&gt; 959 511    Switch (In dash)
&gt; 
&gt; Valente, the partsman at the dealer in Nuevo Laredo
&gt; looked the part up on the computer and they are still
&gt; available. If anyone would like to order them, the
&gt; price quoted was 5400 pesos. I didn't bother to ask
&gt; for the price on the switch as I was in shock.
&gt; Yesterday the exchange rate was 9.30 pesos per
&gt; American Dollar. I'm going to buy another bus instead!
