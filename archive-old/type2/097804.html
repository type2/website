&lt;&lt; If I can't let the list know about the taillights I am putting up on eBay, 
then Bus Depot shouldn't be able to tell me about the new taillights they 
just got in. &gt;&gt;

The solution can be as simple as what I see done on other lists.  Offer the 
taillights directly to list members first!  If nobody here buys them, THEN 
ebay away!  Most of the world seems to find things on ebay just fine with out 
any handholding.
