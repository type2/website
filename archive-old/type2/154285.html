Subject: Re: [T2] saga of NJ emmissions passing + distr qu

Mike asked:


 distr qu- Beltley says timing is 5 deg ATDC for 75, but 7.5 deg BTDC for later busses- I noticed I did her
bus at the later 7.5 as that weas on
 the degr scale (which may have been pulled from a later bus)- why the
 diff, Karl??  The distr may be a later one, but I'd have to pull it to
see the numbers.
Bus- daughter's 75 bus with orig FI stuff on it, passed fine 2 years ago
after a top end rebuild with rod bearings included. Only problem in last
2 years was a random hesitation I traced to a flakey double
relay/contacts, cleaned contacts and replaced it.  It also starts
&quot;hard&quot;- ie crank when cold  5-7 sec, let wait a few seconds, crank again
 and it starts grudgingly- idles poor (need to rev it) until warm, then
 runs fine). This could be a faulty cold start valve?  Normally this bus
does 22mpg on the highway, but did notice on drive from Savannah it only did 16-17, which I thought was due to
rediculous 40 mph winds in that storm up the coast!    Due for insp, passed all but emmisions, like 4.3%  C0
and 337 hydrocarbons. (300 and 3% allowed.)  Temp sensor OK, fuel pressure a bit up on my gauge (35 with vac
connected to pressure reg, about 40 disconnected.  Plug I looked at looked a perfect clean light gray.  When
hot, I thought it odd I could blow/suck through the aux air  valve hose-may be why it idles a lot faster when
warm?  Local VW mech suggested I retard the timing, which I did, but noting that tightening the clamp really
changed it so I did it again, setting it to about 1 deg BTDC.  Opened up the idle mix air on AFM a full turn.
Went thru
 inspection and it was worse, like 550 hydro and about 5% CO-WTF?  At the station I checked the timing and it
was 16 deg advanced!  Could the
 weights be sticking outbound? (but idle was near 1000 rpm). So I retimed it, opened up the AFM a full 6 turns
total and we went through again-  passed fine (about 1.86 CO, hydro under 300.  So timing really affects
emissions- but how could it go that far advanced on its own?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 75 sets at 5 after because it is supposed to have a dual vacuum unit dist with retard vacuum at idle. IF
you are running the same single vacuum unit on the 75 as on the 78, then you need to time it at 7.5 before and
verify that the vacuum hose going to it is ported vacuum [vacuum appears when you open the throttle]. Here is
the specs for the correct 75 dizzy:
