it appers as though in a couple of months i will have around 1000 for 
a bus.  and i have decided it must be a split.  as nice as they all 
are, nothing puts a bigger smile on my face than seeing a nice split 
window.  i would really like a westy but will not be real picky.  im 
in columbus ohio and dont mind making a bit of a drive.  like 5, 6, or 
even 7 hours for the right bus.  question is will 1000 get me a 
running bus?  some dents and a bit of rust are ok as long as i can 
drive it.  remotely solid floors would be an added bonus.  just want 
something i can work on a little at a time and still be able to drive 
it around.  any help in where to go or who to call it would be greatly 
appreciated.
