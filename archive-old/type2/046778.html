Subject: [T2] Heater Cable Replacement

Volks,

Kerry, Thom (73 Devon) and I, recently returned from a big trip around
Europe the report of which I will hopefully have time to write when I am
less snowed under by the work on my desk. We had no trouble with the van and
the only casualty was the heater cables.

So I have the cables which arrived this morning and I am hopefully going to
replace them when I get home after work this evening since I am going to try
and get one more trip before the winter sets in this weekend. What with it
getting dark in London at about 7.30pm at the moment I am keen to know as
much as I can before I start the job. Can anyone help me with this. Where
shall I start underneath at the exchangers or behind the instrument panel. I
haven't checked where the cables run and how I should fit them. Haynes
doesn't help, Muir does and without further help it shall be just me and him
and the dusk closing in.

Any help or past experiences of this would be invaluable.
Good to be back on the list.
Max
