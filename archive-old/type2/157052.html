Nice work, looks real clean.  drives some questions from me, though. 
Like, what guage wiring did you use?  Where did you source your
lighting, and do you remember approximate costs?  I really like the
fusebox you chose.  Any details on that would be welcomed too.
I'm going to re-wire my second battery circuit, so any info you have
will roll straight into my '72 Westy (with '78 camper stuff including
battery shtuff)

Thanks,

Paul Manning
