Subject: Re: [T2] AVP problems

Richard,

They few times I called about the AVP that I got, I left messages and the 
call were returned fairly quickly.

I would expect a new, never fired engine to have some leakdown.
Rings haven't sealed to the cylinder yet, so plenty of clearance.

If I remember correctly 4% leakdown would be considered excellent in a
stocker type engine with some miles on it.

Umm, but 20% and non closing valve is *not* good...so exhaust valve is 
leaking air out...hmmm...I don't suppose you can see anything like a piece 
of paper or anything stuck in the valve opening anywhere?

Cheers, dave

&gt; The second and more serious problem is that #4 exhaust won't close. All
&gt; other three cylinders are leaking down 4-6% past the rings on this never
&gt; fired engine but #4 is leaking horribly (20% or more). I squirted a little
&gt; oil in the exhaust port to watch it crawl up the valve stem.
&gt; 
&gt; Up until this point the rebuild looked good.

&gt; I guess I have to call AVP on Monday. Wish me luck contacting them: they
&gt; rarely answer the phone. I've searched the archives for AVP issues and they
&gt; seem to have issues answering the phone because it's a very small business.
