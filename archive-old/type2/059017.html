&gt;      My 72 camper with a 1977 2 liter engine has on occasion leaked oil with
&gt; much profusion.

I had a completely dry engine ('72 1700 type4) that suddenly leaked everywhere!  The problem was that the hose coming from my breather box had kinked so that the oil pressure built up and just leaked everywhere.  I don't know about the gas smell but check your breather box and all related hoses etc.
