&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; On TV last night was an ad for AT&amp;T wireless, or some sort of digital
phone

&gt; There was this shepard with his sheep and he was calling and staying in
&gt; touch with all of his family apparently, and in one of the scenes in this
&gt; green ( I believe) and white split window Bus on the rolling green hills
&gt; with a few people standing beside it.... it was really nice looking - and
&gt; then gone after about a fes seconds...
&gt;
&gt; Happy trails....
