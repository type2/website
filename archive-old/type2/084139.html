Subject: Re: [T2] starting fluid

I know this thread started [pun] out different,, I just wanted to release a
racers secret!
If you mix 4 oz. of Liquid ether with 4 oz. of Caster oil in 5 gallons of pump
gas,, you have a super race fuel,,, and by the time they check for oxygen
bearing fuels,, it has evaporated,,
You could feel the difference in the seat of your pants,,, but who cared, the
engine was apart in 10 races anyways,,

Available at a drug store,,,They always made me sign a poison tracking book,,,

&gt;Just look at engines made to run on fuels like this. They are race engines. VWs by design were not &gt;specifically designed to run on this kind of fuel. 


From what I know,, this IS the type of fuel we are getting at the pumps
today!,,, what is the additive they put in pump gas today,,, MTBE ???  that &quot;E&quot;
stands for ether doesn't it??




&gt; ether in your gas engine feel free, but if I am going to pay someone $1600 for a new long block, I think I &gt;will stick to what Jim Budreau, ASE certified, master technician, and builder, and racer of funny cars told &gt;me. I figure someone who has a masters degree in this area, and builds race engines should be the one I &gt;trust. To each his own, and good luck!  Maybee you could design an ether injection system on your bus and &gt;have you a funny bus. I think I will keep mine serious!                  Peace!
