Subject: Re: re-winter storage in barns

Since you are splitting hairs. . . It is not an enzyme but rather a
metabolite called methanethiol.

&gt;Actually, that isn't ammonia you smell - it's an enzyme.
&gt;And only about 30% of people produce it, and fewer than
&gt;5% can smell it. Among whom was Babe Ruth (and me).
