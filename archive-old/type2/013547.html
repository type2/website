Subject: Fuel Line Length

Hey All -
Say, can anyone tell me what approximate length of fuel line is needed to
do a total line replacement on a 79 bus?  I currently have about 20 feet of
HP fuel line on hand, but need to use about 6 inches for something else and
don't want to come up short.  I've seen various posts where the claimed
amount of line required ranges from 10 feet to 25 feet.  Thanks for your
help!
