Hi all.

I just bought a 70 Westy to get many much needed parts for my 69.
Namely an engine and trans.

The 70 has the original 1600SP engine, rebuilt to stock but external oil 
cooler mounted on the rear qurter panel.

I want to put this engine and the tranny into my 69, but put a doghouse oil 
cooler on instead.

First, is this even possible (I hope so) second, where can I get the 
doghouse parts (I need the cooler, tin and shroud?) new vs. bone yard. 
Should they be for the engine year or the body year?


Also, it looks like the driver's side pushrod tubes are leaking at the valve 
cover. Can I reseal these without too much trouble? Which book is best for 
the job: Muir/ Bentley/ Clymer? Any tips not listed in the books?

If there's anyone with the energy to tackle these questions, I'd much 
appreciate it.

Jason
