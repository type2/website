Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Total VW dead

No idea how it affects Camper and Commercial, which I also 
subscribe to. I retyped the letter verbatim so you know as 
much as I do.

I can't recall when my Camper and Commercial renews. I will 
certainly be careful when it does... but realisticly I like 
the magazine so much it is worth the risk (I will be staying 
away from multi-year renewals though).

Thanks,
Chris

You mentioned Jazz Publishing.  Does this mean VW Camper and 
Commercial will cease also as they are also thru Jazz?
