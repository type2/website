Subject: Re: [T2] Bleeding brakes

 A few weeks ago Richard wrote:


 I always thought brake lines should be bled from longest line to shortest
 but page 30 of Brakes in Wheels in Bentley says right front, left front,
 right rear, left rear is the order.

 The left-right order is correct just not the front-rear. I understand the
mc
 is dual circuit but why does Bentley state that order?

Did anyone ever have an answer for this one? Is this a misprint, or am I
missing something crucial here?
Cheers,
Matthew
