Subject:  RE [T2] Brakes pulling to the right.

[...]
 The first time I would drive the bus on a given day, she would
&gt; pull noticeably to the right. This would be the only time it would happen
&gt; while being driven until she sat  overnight again.
&gt; Yesterday it started happening each time I brake. I need to get
&gt; this fixed.


I would bet money on the flexible rubber pipes _at_the wheels. replace both,
not just one. They de-nature with age and get swollen inside, finally
closing.  Going
right...check the left one.
