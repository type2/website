Subject: A little ingenuity needed here!!

OK, all you shop teachers.  Here is a challenge.

Recently I visited a VW nut with a machine shop.  He fabricated some 
aluminum 'pipe' stock so that it could be threaded into the spark plug hole, 
and then the compression tester could be threaded into the other end of the 
aluminum 'pipe'

The aluminum 'pipe' had an O ring where it went into the head, like the 
normal compression tester.

It was a fat as a polish kelbasi, and seemed to be about 8&quot; long.

He was willing to sell it to me for $40, which I thought too much.

This aluminum extension will make finding the right angle and the hole much 
easier, and also easier to get off if the engine is 'hot'.


Sounds like a good project for some high school shop teacher.  Design and 
produce prototypes, cost factors, style and man-hour estimates.  And I want 
one!!
