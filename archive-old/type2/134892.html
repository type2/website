Subject: Re: [T2] Another dizzy question

David asked:

 My stock DVDA dizzy died recently and I installed a bug dizzy I had as a
spare (until Santa hopefully brings me a new SVDA or equivalent).  I then
had a big flat spot - the bus would have no power until 3,000rpm and then
it would take off like a rocket (well, relatively speaking!).  I unhooked
the vac advance and revved it with the timing light on and  I am getting NO
 mechanical advance at all until about 3,000rpm.

 My question is, is this normal for a Bug dizzy?  I looked it up at one time
 and I think it was for a 74-ish bug and I am not using the vac retard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, not normal at all. The mechanical advance curve should be real close to
the type4 curve.

Pop off your cap and try twisting the rotor in the direction of rotation.

Does it twist easily and spring right back?

Or does it stay wherever you move it not move at all?

If the latter, remove the rotor and the felt pad in the center. Get some carb cleaner spray,
not brakekleen, and spray down the center where the felt pad was to fill the opening.
Let it soak, spray again. Put the rotor on and twist repeatedly til it frees up. Spray again and again til it
is nice and free and springs back. Now put oil in the top, then the felt pad back, then soak the felt with
oil.

That part of the maintence program is totally neglected 100% of the time. It is shown in the 68-79 Bentley,
section 9, page 11, fig 5-6, #1......
