Subject: Part Needed for '66 Kombi

I am in dire need of a pair of hinges for the engine compartment lid on 
my '66 Kustom Kombi project.  The hinges on it now are held together with 
rusted nails.

If anyone has a rust free or rusted but still freely moving pair please 
let me know. 

Thanks!

Minnesota Vintage VW Weekend!!  Less than a week away!  Can't wait, but 
wish my '66 was ready.
