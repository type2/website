&gt;It's just what the counterman told me....Turns out, that was the only
&gt;thing my Dad had done to his car in months and started having a problem
&gt;right after he did it.
&gt;
&gt;In the three weeks before we fixed it, we did *every* check I could
&gt;imagine on his engine and ignition system.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;grin&gt; you are quite welcome to try it on *your* plugs&lt;grin&gt;

I don't want to dispute but frankly I've used WD40 on several occasions
as a water displacement device to hose down entire ignition systems
including the plugs.  My old '85 had an annoying habit in this sort of
weather with salt spray on the roads of beginning to miss horribly, the
WD-40 was always a sure cure if I was in the middle of nowhere, and I
know I didn't change those plugs in the 40k or so it was in my posession.
The real cure was to take the plugs, cap, wires, coil scrub em all down
in distilled water every so often and dry em in the oven, but that was a bit
hard to do in the parking lot on the average 20 degree day after work.  This
is in fact I believe a sort of standard use for WD-40, used to even proclaim
it as such on the can.  Never got why it happened on the '85, didn't on the
'86, '87, or '90 maybe the 1.9 engine was prone to contrariness or maybe
the ignition system was weak, never did figure it out.

Just saying.  Still your results sort of speak to it mattering, perhaps it
depends on how hot the plugs get, etc.  I can't imagine oil and kerosene
being conductive on the ceramic but who knows.
