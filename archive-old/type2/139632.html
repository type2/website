Subject: Re: [T2] air filters on Solexes

Chris,

I have used cut off pieces from large radiator type hoses to bring carb
bases &quot;up&quot; to a height that would accept an aftermarket air filter.

Mounting and gluing or taking part of a plastic pvc pipe to finish off the 
install is up to your imagination.

I buy lots of NLA'd and unobtanium car parts at Lowe's.  &lt;grin&gt;

You should see some of my contraptions!

For example:  need Kadron filters that absolutely would not fit under the 
places they needed to go.

Lowes's has a very nice 90 degree 2&quot; rubber elbow with two clamps that is
then attached to a piece of PVC 90 degreee pipe with the other clamp...the 
&quot;off road&quot; K&amp;N looking airfilters then clamped perfectly to the PVC pipe.

Air cleaners wiggle a little, but look and work great hanging upside down.

They do have sizes other than 2&quot;  take a piece of pipe or something with 
you that is the same OD as your carb neck.  

Cheers, dave

&gt; Does anyone have a recommendation for air filters to go on top of the Solex carbs on a 72 1700?  The air filters I've seen won't fit onto the very small &quot;edge&quot; of these carbs.
&gt; Thanks!  -Chris
