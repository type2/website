&gt;Clever fella you are ;-)  I like the modified cutter idea.  What do you use
&gt;for the crimpable cable ends and where do you get em?

From Ace as well, just little 1/4&quot;-3/8&quot; aluminum rod bits with the right
size hole drilled in em.  You could make them but they are dirt
cheap and already made.  They sell em with the aircraft cable and
the crimper tool they got (which in its defense is only $15 so if it
doesn't work very well, what the hell.)  I'm sure the load from a set
of vanagon power windows thunking to a stop exceeds that on a
sunroof cable unless the roof jams.

I've meant to do the tool thing as I got like 3 pairs of those cheapo
cable cutters but until recently had access to the real things so didn't
care.  Maybe next time I do one it will become a priority, who knows.
I think you could get about 3 die sizes ground into the blade area
of the cutters.  Maybe one for 1/16&quot; and 1/8&quot; aircraft cable and one
for 00 size wire or whatever battery cable usually is.

An aside here is that at the rocket factory we were going to use
little crimped cables (1/16&quot; cable) to deploy some forward moving
fins (moving forward against Mach 3 slipstream) in an intricate
design for a tank round.  FWIW the end result of a $12k contract
to determine what you could get out of various metal ends crimped
on that size cable was about 100-150 pound pullout.  So that is
about it on 1/16.  Obviously bigger can take much more ala VW
clutch cables.  I actually always wanted to just test one of mine
I had this feeling these smucks were taking us on the whole thing.
So go government subcontracts though.
