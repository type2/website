I hate these kind of problems,  I would bet that this has nothing to do
with the head sensor but a broken/loose wire somewhere.  I would get it
running any way you can and then move wires around wiggling things see if
something causes problems.
  remember I was having all sorts of problems with mine cutting out,
checked everything, seems it was a bad connector on the wire to the
coil...

&gt; I tested my temperature head sensor today. I first disconnected the senso=
r=20
&gt; wire but left the sensor installed. To take the measurements I simply=20
&gt; connected my positive lead to the sensor wire and the negative lead to th=
e=20
&gt; ground terminal of my battery. Is this right? I took a resistance reading=
=20
&gt; when the sensor was cold and found 10k ohms. I then started the bus with =
the=20
&gt; meter connected and watched the reading. The resistance dropped to 500 oh=
ms=20
&gt; after about 5 minutes of running. It seemed to stabalise around this poin=
t.
&gt;=20
&gt; I reconnected the sensor wire and started the bus. It ran for less than a=
=20
&gt; minute and shut down. The same occurs when I restart.
&gt;=20
&gt; I believe that the sensor is deffective but I am trying to make sense of=
=20
&gt; this situation.
&gt;=20
&gt; Why does the bus run when the sensor is disconnected? Shouldn't it be see=
ing=20
&gt; an open circuit at the sensor input?
&gt;=20
&gt; In one case when I disconnected the sensor wire the bus would not start a=
t=20
&gt; all. I reconnected and it started and died. I then disconnected the senso=
r=20
&gt; wire and it started and remained running.
&gt;=20
&gt; Am I missing something here?
