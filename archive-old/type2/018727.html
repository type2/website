I have one of these air compressors......   in it's original zip lock bag, with
instructions......   it is Blue in colour, made by Coleman, with end caps that
are attached, but sort of flip open, so that the air hose and power wire can be
wrapped around it.......
the power wire plug has a strange end on it ( it can be used in a standard 12
accessory outlet, or the small one located in the dash of the later westies...)
if you want any more info feel free to ask......  no it's not for sale   :-)
Jamie.....  if you are going to the Great Canadian Bug Show.... I can bring it
there for you to scope out if you want......
