Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Towing a Campermobile with a Vanagon?

&gt;We could get really ridiculous and mention Australia where they run trains of
&gt;trailers on flat straight roads, but that's got nothing to do with a Bus,
&gt;either...

You know if I could create a system that tied the brakes of the tow vehicle 
to the brakes of the towee and if I could have a 150 HP engine and if and 
couple other things could happen I might consider doing a tow job like 
this... &lt;grin&gt; Whoa - I've got a big SUV now. Never mind... &lt;grin&gt;
