Subject: [T2] 1600 shims

&gt;Question is, on a 1971 bus the 1600 size engine, how many shims is to many.
&gt;Or just check end play and slap them in till good. The bus we just bought was
&gt;dumping oil so out the engine came checked end play and other things but it
&gt;looks as though there is about 1/16inch space. I don;t have  a true gauge but

You can make a simple effective tool with a bolt and feeler gauges.
Info for that is in the Muir. If you measured that much play with the
main seal and shims currently installed. you will have to have the
case line-bored. Three shims does it, and you can't do it in three.
1/16 is .060, the limit is .006. Did you remove the flywheel ?
