&gt; Just an FYI, an old friend of mine had a 68 westy he bought off a couple

&gt; but with a panel which slid out and slept 2 upstairs.

Chris,

If the poptop rose straight up, then it was not a Westy.  

The nomenclature gets horibbly confusing thru all the possible variations,
especially since 
(a)many companies made camper conversions based on VW bodies (Devon,
   Adventurewagen, California Camper, Safare, etc.); 
(b)Westfalia made conversion packages that they sold separately from
   their own conversions (usually for dealer intallation); and 
(c)some converters started with Westfalias and added on extra cabinets or 
   a poptop of their own design.

but only those made by Westfalia at the Westfalia Werke were Westies. Now
it can also get downright confusing when someone takes an Adventurewagen
and puts a Westfalia interior camping package into it, and I would not
know what to label that but I was only commenting on full Westfalia
conversions available thru VW dealers.
