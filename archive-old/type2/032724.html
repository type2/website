&gt; Volks,

&gt; Both my '67 and my '73 have one relict curtain (behind the suicide
&gt; cabinet) that is the original butterscotch plaid. Both are missing the
&gt; rest :-( Has anyone found a fabric that is even close to this pattern? Has
&gt; anyone got a set (or two? :-) boxed in their basement/garage that they
&gt; would like to sell?  

I need them too, all but two of the curtan's on my 72 apear to be costom
made aftermarket, the one behind the cabanet and the one that pins up on
the windshield, id perfir something a bit more origional looking, while
the new one's are nice maybe i should have the other two changed.
