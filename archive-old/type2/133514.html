&gt; My experience with the foam seals has been the same as yours.

&gt; I did see a later post where Richard said the ones from gowesty fit
&gt; right...maybe Ron or some of the other suppliers can jump on this one?
&gt; I have *never* had one long enough....from at least two different
&gt; suppliers.

I've discovered over the years that how you put one on has as much to do
with how long they are as anything, I have had one &quot;Not fit&quot; took it off
and put it back with a little more tension and it was then too long....

BTW. I put shiny side down and the joint between ends of the seal in the
front (F is F) above the flywheel where a gap is less of a problem anyway
