Subject: RE: Help!  For anyone with Hankook tires on a Vanagon/Bubble
  Bus

&gt; I'm trying to decide on the purchase from the Bus Depot of a set of 
&gt; Hankook RA-08 195 series (not the 185's) tires for my
&gt; '87 Vanagon Westy.  Perhaps - OKAY! - I'm definitely getting anal 
&gt; about this.  I'm hoping that the outer tire diameter of the 195 series 
&gt; Hankook's is a bit bigger/taller than the Michelin MXL 205/70R14&quot; 
&gt; tires currently on my Carat alloys.


You can find some info on comparative diameters of 195R14 versus 205/70R14
here:

And a veru useful tire size calculator here:

http://www.miata_dot_net/garage/tirecalc.html

While there are slight variations from one tire of the &quot;same&quot; size to
another, a 195R14 is approximately 1/2&quot; taller and 1/3&quot; narrower than a
205/70R14.
