Subject: [T2] Varnish in my gas tank

I have recently aquired a 1972 Westy that has been sitting for 7 years.

The fuel left in the tank has turned to jello.

I realize that the best way to remedy this problem is to remove, drain,
clean, and recaot the inside of the tank, but has anyone found anything that
offers an alternative route.

Also...this engine appears to be a pure porsche transplant.

The PO told me that her father had it done a few months before they parked
it.  I don't know much about a Porsche engine but this unit has a cap on top
of the fan shroud (for checking and setting the timing).  I am seeking any
info I can on how else to confirm or deny that it is or is not.

She also told me the reason they parked it was because it stuck in gear.  So
far I can't say that is the case.  I have used the riding mower to tow it to
the garage and back and it rolls freely.

I did get the engine to run today by trickling gas in through the carb.  It
sounds really strong and it might just be me, but it sounds different than a
typical bus engine.  I know, my hearing my just be bad.


Is there anything that will break up the varnish so it will drain with the
old gas at least partially cleaning the tank?

Does anyone have a tank for a 72???

What fuel pump is required for this bus?  The one in it is not stock and I
think the varnish has pretty much done it in.

I do have a Bentley and I am reading but I most certainly will welcome all
of your thoughts.  Robert would also if he were alive.

Thanks,
