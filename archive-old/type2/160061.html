Subject: Re: [T2] signal blinker relay

Relay should be readily available, however, you might double check  
the hazard switch.   I have a 74 westy as well, and was getting  
erratic  blinker operation.  Turned out that the plastic connection  
cover to metal box on flasher switch has come apart!!  Tied strapped  
the two back together, and now works like a charm.  Good luck.

&gt;   Any ideas? I have looked (in vain) for a repl;acement. My Westy
