Subject: Re: [T2] Living in a Bus

Re: Mr Henley's comments...

To quote Phil Ochs, &quot;There but for fortune...&quot;

&lt;http://www.cs.pdx_dot_edu/~trent/ochs/lyrics/there_but_for_fortune.html&gt;

Statistically most Americans are within only a few paychecks from living
on the streets.  Unemployment happens.  Ask me how I know.  

Bus owner wants to crash in my driveway for a few days?  That's what
it's there for.  For a few weeks?  Maybe. Depends on the circumstances. 
Remember the Grendel Saga.

Jim
