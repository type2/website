Hi Volks,

Just brought Retro back from the shop. I was attempting to have the 
alignment done. The mechanic didn't charge me and said that in order to 
adjust the toe on the front driver side wheel I need to get an adjustable 
tie rod. Strangely enough the one on the passenger side is adjustable but 
not the other. I guess I just want to know where to buy one RMMW maybe 
since i'm in Wyoming . I don't have my catalouge and the web site did not 
allow me to find the right part for my 75 westy. Does anyone know the part 
# or can anyone tell me what supplier to call. I'm in kind of a hurry . I 
plan to hit the road for california this week.P.S the manufacturer calls 
for a 4 wheel alignment on this vehicle but my mechanic found no 
adjustments for rear castor or camber. Anyone Know how that goes??

Thanks 
Mickey 
75 westy RETRO
