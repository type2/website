Since people have been building (and rebuilding) the basic internal
combustion engine for a hundred years or so, I wouldn't think getting
good hiop in an engine would be a &quot;trade secret&quot; by now, unless the
rebuilder was doing a radical redesign of the basic engine or its
components.  Isn't the &quot;secret&quot; to good hiop to look at the engine's
spec's, particularly bearings and oil pump, and to work these
components (i.e, &quot;blueprint&quot; the parts) down to &quot;minimum clearance&quot;
specs?  It would seem to me the &quot;secret&quot; to good hiop is to have
perfectionist tendencies, and the equipment, and the skill, and the
time, to get the critical tolerances &quot;right.&quot;

&gt; There are some trade secrets involved in getting good
&gt; hiop with a Type 4.  The only rebuilder I ever heard
&gt; of that would specify what you would get was Mark
&gt; Stevens.  I've heard of no one else who will specify
&gt; it; not Boston Bob, not Mofoco, and I'll bet not AVP.
&gt; I feel this is a VW mystery waiting to be solved.
