Subject: Trouble fitting new brake rotors. ('76)
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello list.  
I purchased new disk brake rotors for my '76 from Bus Depot, and got
ready to install them.  I was impressed by how much thicker they are
than the very worn ones that I had on my bus.  That is the problem. 
They are so thick that when I bolt on the new rotors, I can't get the
calipers to slide over the rotors so that the calipers line up with
their mounting holes.  I am confident that I've got the new rotors to
mate up flush with the hub, but it seems that I'm lacking 1/4 of an
inch of clearance.  This is not a result of the calipers being pushed
out -- it is the caliper frame that snags the rotor.  (Pads are not in
the calipers).  Any ideas?  I think I may have the wrong rotors, but I
measured their thickness, and they are 13 mm which Haynes says is the
right thickness, and the other dimensions look correct, though I can't
be sure.  The only thing that I can think of is that I didn't get the
wheel bearings back on all the way when I repacked them while I had
the rotors off, but I really don't think I've got both bearing sets on
wrong.

any suggestions are very appreciated.
