Subject: help, and back VWs in Bolivia.

        Yesterday I sent a request for help to all on the list. Sorry, but
I had intended to send it to the listserver as a command to receive
instructions on subscribing. I just got back from a month in South America
and couldn't find my instructions explaining how I could once again be on
the list. I hope I didn't upset or alarm an one. Many thanks for all those
who where quick to respond with a general instructions.
        In regards to VW vans in Bolivia. As you might assume, there are
many about. The hybrid Samba-bay window was a high point of the trip. I saw
many throughout La Paz and Cochabamba, in many different configurations. I
enjoyed most those which were painted up with various firms logos:
everything from the regional news channel to advertisement for ice cream.
Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to drive one. Maybe next time.
        A few things I did notice about these Brazilian vans which
surprised me was the poor quality of the fitting of some of the body
panels. I spent a bit of time going over various vans I found parked
through out La Paz, and I was a bit taken back by This. Gaps where uneven,
or not flush with adjoining panels. Of course they may not have come from
the factory in this state and what I saw may have been the result of poor
servicing and repairs.
        Unlike an earlier visit to Costa Rica this year, there was an
absence of water cooled conversions. This may be because of the ready
supply of parts from across the boarder, from Brazil. In all, I saw only
one van with a radiator strapped to the front.
        In La Paz I saw no splits, whereas in Cochabamba they where much
more frequent. Given the new wealth being generated in La Paz, the older
vehicles are being displaced by BMW and Mercedes, as well as many japanese
built utility vehicles. The earliest rolling split I saw was a 1963 micro
bus. Almost all the splits where fitted with Safari windows. I checked with
a parts supplier that claimed that he could order an new set of safaris for
about $140 USA. When I return next spring I'll have to follow through and
see if this is possible. Other then that I didn't find any NOS parts. Most
of the shops I checked had as expected a good supply of new parts. Next
time I'll try and comb the dealers to see what they have in old stock.
        I did but a new set of cylinders. Unlike the sets I've bought in
the past, these Mahle cylinders for a 1600 motor are in a deluxe kit which
includes a set of push rod tubes, a tube of silicone gasket sealer, and a
gasket set. In all I paid $84.00, a price which seems to match those I see
in the back of American VW magazines.
        That was about it for Bolivia and vws. One final note, I drove into
a number of remote villages. One of which took three attempts. The first
two times, my landcruiser was not up to it. In all we ascended to 4 1/2
kilometers above sea level, snow blizzards that reduced visibility to
nothing, and drove around and over rock slides, and flooded rivers. Through
all this I finally arrived, having driven the final seven hours in second
gear. When I drove into the village thinking only the toughest of vehicles
cold possibly indue such abuse, I saw a prime late model 1302 VW beetle,
looking as proud as the day it rolled of the assembly line in Brazil.
