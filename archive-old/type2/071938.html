&gt;I have the option of purchasing a complete set of used but running ( I know
&gt;the guy and saw them on his bus), solex dual 32's.  with manifolds, linkage,

&gt;what these are worth??  I would like to have a fresh set around that are
&gt;rebuilt ready to go.

That sounds like a good deal to me.

&gt;2nd question...i was doing a valve adjust.  and was checking some things on
&gt;the motor.  popped of the air cleaner stuff, checked the choke and noticed
&gt;one of my accelerator pump nozzles was gone,( the one that curves and points
&gt;straight down into the carb.) so now when i step on the gas all the accel.
&gt;pump does it gurgle up a stream of gas instead of shooting it down into the
&gt;carb.  obviously i need to replace it.  i have no found anywhere to find a
&gt;replacement one so far.  any suggestions??  and also i wonder where it went
&gt;and if it did any damage??  i have not noticed any change in performance.

I've had that condition before also.  The difference it made for me was
that it caused hesitation during acceleration - much like the flat spot/009
syndrome.  I pulled a nozzle out of a junk carb I had lying around, scuffed
up the end a little and pushed it into the carb as hard as I could after
applying loctite.  It hasn't come loose yet but it does make me nervous.

If you buy the other set of carbs, you can swap just the top of the carb
with the missing nozzle (the nozzle is in the top piece) so you won't have
to bother with R&amp;R'ing the nozzle itself.
