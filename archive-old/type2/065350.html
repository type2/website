Subject: Re: Lookin into 77/78 Campers

&gt;What is the downside of 79's? i understand tha the 77's don't have 
&gt;Hydraulic lifters, but i was under the impression that 78/79's were 
&gt;pretty much the same???
&gt;
&gt;just wondering-----&gt;Drew a 78/79 wannacamper
&gt;

The '79 is the first year that required a Catalytic Converter in the 49 
states.

The '79 motor has square-ported heads, just like the 80-83 Vanagon motor.  
This means they require different heater boxes.  (Even the Vanagon heater 
boxes cannot be used because they do not work with the Bus fan shroud).  
Since these are one-year-only heater boxes they can be difficult (and 
expensive) to find used.  I believe they are no longer available new.  

Also, the exhaust is different, and also '79 only. (While a 72-74 exhaust 
will fit, it does not provide for the CAT.)

None of the above are tremendous problems, but can be a pain in the neck.  
Other than these areas, the '78 and '79 are the same.
