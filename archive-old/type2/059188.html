Subject: Gas Fumes After Refueling

After a rest/refuel stop yesterday on the way back from Buses Near The Bay,my wife and daughter complained they could smell gas. I'm aware of the rubber hose connecting the filler neck to the tank, and a search of the archives shows this is a common cause of this problem, but tonight I popped of that round plate behind the ECU, and from what I could see and feel, the hose seems to be OK. What else can cause gas fumes in the cabin? BTW, I did'nt overfill the tank.   Thanks, Jeff
