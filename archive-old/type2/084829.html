Subject: Re: [T2] new/resto fiberglass pop-top needed

Fix what you've got.

Make a visit to a boat shop or a Corvette shop where they do alot of 
fiberglass work and they can talk you through it.

Just pull it and refinish it. Bet you can do it yourself no problem.

I can answer questions tomorrow at length if you like. Just e-mail me back.

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I'm currently restoring my '78 VW Bus &amp; my pop-top is in pretty bad
&gt;shape.  I'm wanting to find a new and/or refurbished fiberglass pop
&gt;top.  Ironically, my canvas is still in useable condition, so it's only
&gt;the fiberglass shell I need.  I've seen buses around town that appear to
&gt;have new white tops on them, but I've not been able to find out where to
&gt;get one.  I've tried all over online, resto shops, etc., with no luck.
&gt;
&gt;If anyone knows of how to find one, I'd really appreciate the
&gt;information.  I've searched through the type2 archives, but found
&gt;nothing I could use.
&gt;
&gt;Please Help!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Kris
