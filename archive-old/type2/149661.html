Subject: RE: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

Have you tried new bales?

I have always had good luck with silcone between gasket and cover. Then 
grease between gasket and head.

This has worked on the Upright engines, Type IV engines and Water Boxer.

Good Luck,

&gt;I have tried the old cork style, and the rubber rubber ones (twice) and 
&gt;they
&gt;still leaking.  I have threatened to weld them in place (kidding) . Any
&gt;suggestions?
