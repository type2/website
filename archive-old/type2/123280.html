&gt;Found everything I needed but also found some nice little brass ball
&gt;valves for less than $10.

The brass shouldn't care, but I wonder about the compatibility of the
seals in the valve with gasoline.

Essentially you're making a reserve tap like on old Buses.  Motorcycles
have these too; I wonder if a BMW or some Japanese bike has the same fuel
tank thread as a VW, such that sanely priced reserve taps might be
available?

&gt;Question: anyone aware of a tool that would allow me to flare the ends of
&gt;the metal line on the bottom of the gas tank so I could add ALL steel fuel
&gt;lines to the fuel system?

I would think you could use a regular flaring tool, as used for copper
water tubing, etc.  If the metal is thin it might help to make a double
flare.  You probably realize this, but you don't want _all_ the fuel
lines in steel - there has to be some give somewhere between the body
and the engine.
