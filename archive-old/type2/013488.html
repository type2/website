&gt;Heck, I am STILL trying to get two teaspoons of oil into #3!!  How do you do 
&gt;this without spilling some all over the place.  I can use a squirt (oil) can 
&gt;with a flexible neck, but how do I know I got the 2 teaspoons in, or did I 
&gt;squirt oil all over the place??

Hoover had a suggestion about this many moons back (actually, it was how 
to measure cc capacity of your replacement head, so you can get the 
volume ratios correct, but the same tool applies here): Go down to your 
local veterinary hospital (the rural one where they work on big animals 
like Horses), and simply ask for an old syringe (explain why so they 
don't think you're some kind of junkie). They can give it to you sans 
needle, and you end up with this big fat syringe which can hold rather 
large quantities of fluid with quite high accuracy. For difficult to 
reach places (read: #3) attach a small piece of fish tank plastic tubing. 
Voila! Precise cc measurement of fluids, no messy spills, and a new 
bizarre tool to wow friends and acquaintances with...

FWIW, I offered to pay for the one I got from the vet, but they just let 
me have it. New as well, IIRC...


Peace,
