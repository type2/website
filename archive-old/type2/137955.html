Subject: Re: [T2] Boneyard find

So many of the people who have them just owned them as cars and
weren't anything special to them. They just figure when the engine
goes you junk it like most other cars. Of course the one in the
boneyard here is full of GD stickers, so you would think....

 Is it just me or is the crushing of bays becoming too commonplace?
 Additionally, it seems that many ma and pa junkyards are sending all
 their stuff to the boneyard.  I guess that is what happens when the
 price of steel and progress win out.  Shame, shame, shame...
