Probably all of the answers you have seen are correct...

You need to qualify your question

	What size engine do you have? 1600 and 2000 were both stock for a '79.
	Does it have 1 or 2 carbs or is it Fuel Injected?
	Do you have an FI petrol tank?
	Are you using a fuel pump in the standard location?

When you put some meat on your question I'm sure someone with the
same/similar configuration will be able to assist you?

Good luck

Hey All -
[Note: I posted this inquiry a week ago with no luck, so I thought give it
another go.]  Say, can anyone tell me what approximate length of fuel line
is needed to do a total line replacement on a 79 bus?  I currently have
about 20 feet of HP fuel line on hand, but need to use about 6 inches for
something else and don't want to come up short.  I've seen various posts
where the claimed amount of line required ranges from 10 feet to 25 feet.
Thanks for your
help!
