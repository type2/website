Hi from New Zealand.

In this country we are required to pass a fairly extensive 'Warrant of Fitness' test on the mechanical safety of our vehicles. Once passed, we can then apply to have the vehicle registered for use on our roading system. To be caught on our roads (even parked) without both of the above subjects the owner to a heavy fine.
My '76 T2 recently failed it's warrant because of a series of problems, including structural rust. I arranged to move the vehicle (known as von Kermit) some 460 miles to my residence (I had just purchased it) and had it re-inspected today.
My certified inspector/mechanic/panelbeater has just quoted less than five hundred US dollars to fix the rust problem bu rolling new metal as well as giving the engine a complete work over! It turns out that these are his favourite vehicles (and yes, that's how we spell favourite down here)!
So - there will be another camper roaring around the southern hemisphere roads before Christmas.
Which is why I'm on such a high tonight.

Keep posting those messages, folks. You don't realise what a mine of information it is for people in this part of the world.

Cheers,

John

and von Kermit
