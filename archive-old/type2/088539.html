One more time..
I am making a broad assumption that the 78 and 79 transmissions are the =
same.. nicht Wahr?
How many miles do these transmissions generally give?
Are they the same equipment for a Westy camper and for a transporter?
Are they superior for highway performance, especially when carrying a =
greater weight load, as in full camper gear?
Any answers to these questions would be greatly appreciated.  Jan B
