Subject: Re: [T2] Flywheel cleaning &amp; starter bushing

&gt; What should I use to clean my flywheel? Brake cleaner?

Yes, excellent choice.

&gt; How do I know if it needs machining?

Put a staight edge on it, shine a light behind the straight edge.  See a
lot of light? Machine the flywheel.  Run a fingernail across the contact
surface.  Does it catch severely? Machine the flywheel.  This is a
judgement call as the clutch disk will wear in to some imperfections but
that &quot;wearing in&quot; is robbing you of clutch life-span.

&gt; Also, it has been a long time since I replaced the starter bushing. How do I
&gt; do this? I remember it ibeing easy. Do I just drive it out with something?

Yes, with the engine out you can just drive the old bushing out with a
punch.

&gt; Seems like I remember soaking the new one in oil? before I installed it.

Oil is good.  Also apply grease to the starter shaft when installing it..

                             OOK!
