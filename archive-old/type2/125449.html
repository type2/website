Subject: RE: [T2] Germany vs Brazil Master Cylinder

&gt; In looking at a new master cylinder for Possum I see two 
&gt; choices on Bus Depot. $120 for a German one or $30 for a 
&gt; Brazilian one. Is the Brazilian one really that cheap (lower 
&gt; quality) or is the German one simply that good plus its OEM? 


The Brazilian ones come from Varga, who is a long established Brazilian
manufacturer. We have been selling them for years without any problems,
and I''ve used them for years myself as well. While I'd be more than
happy to sell you the expensive one, frankly if I were buying one for my
own bus I'd save the cash and get the Varga.
