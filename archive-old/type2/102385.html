&gt; Have you checked the cam/crank spacing.  Seeing that the damage is 
&gt; primarily on the #1 cam bearing, I'd suspect a cam gear to crank gear 
&gt; size mismatch.

I've been following this thread from the beginning
over on the other list, before the engine was assembled.
My original theory was that the cam/crank bearing bore 
centerlines are incorrect.
If so, that would produce unusual stress characteristics 
in the bearings, like what we have here.
Craig spent a lot of time on backlash.
