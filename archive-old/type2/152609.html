Subject: Re: [T2] Porsche Pulley

hello Phil   Looks like them except that the new ones I'm getting dont have 
those notches in them for holding with a screw driver   That price is about 
what they cost from porsche and you would also need the hub and washers   I would 
just buy all the parts at the same time from a reputable dealer so the what 
you get is the true item instead of taking a chance on e crooks  it will fit 
any type 1 motor which is what you should have  later and have fun  mark Dearing
