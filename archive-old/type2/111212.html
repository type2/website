Subject: 70 amp alternator cooling boot news

Bad news,

I ordered one of the 70amp alternator cooling boots
from the Bus Depot. Ron emailed me today and let me
know that the manufacturer changed the status of them
this week from backordered to unavailable. I am
keeping myself on the waiting list but he said it
could be at least 6 weeks to several months before
they become available again, if they become available
again. Oh well. I guess I am going to have to
fabricate somthing from a sheet of thick ruber that I
have (not an old inter tube). Can someone email me a
picture of one of these? I would like to have an idea
of what it looks like so I don't have to cobb up
somthing from scratch. If anyone has an old used one
lying around that they would not mind selling, let me
know. I don't care if it is perfect or not.

Sorry I could not help!

Regards,
David Kelly
