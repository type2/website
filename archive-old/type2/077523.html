&gt; I have a 70 westy camper, and it is called a 'sunroof camper' That is because

Almost.

You'll also need to concoct a method of installing the drain nipples and
tubes into your sunroof pan....the campers DO NOT have these.  without
them..well.  you'd be better off just leaving the hole open.


You'll also need to close up all of the holes in the roof from the poptop
hardware...and there will be a LOT of them. (from the canvas, the front
hinges, the rear legs, and from the luggage rack..)
