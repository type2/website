Subject: Reflex Yellow

Does anyone know if the new limited edition beetle color &quot;Reflex Yellow&quot; is
the very same as that used on many 70's circa buses? I have a '76 Westy that
is nearly an identical color and believe it was called &quot;Chromium Yellow&quot;? 

Not really bus specific, but hey its Friday........
