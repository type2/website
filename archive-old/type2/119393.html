Subject: Oil drain screw thread-stripped :-(

Hi All,

So, I was attempting to change the oil in my bus today and found (most
disappointingly) that the threads in the oil pan are stripped.

The screw goes in tight for a little bit then gets to a point where it just
keeps turning without getting any tighter. I don't know how long it's been this
way (it's a new bus, for me).

What are my options? Should I buy a slightly larger screw and try to fix it with
a tap and die kit? If not does that mean I need to replace the oil pan?

Thanks,
Harry
