Subject: Interim Bus Nose Fix

Here's my Reader's Digest condensed version of the interim nose fix for
the visually-oriented short attention-spanned curious individual. My bus
is now legal!!! Oh, happy day! Someday the insurance company will get it
together and get me a settlement, but for now I think this is bee-yoo-tee-ful!

You'll be getting The Pro's step-by-step how-to version in the near
future. I was just the involved assistant, partner in brainstorming, and
person behind the wheel.
