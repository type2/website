Yeah,
I will bring a few sets of tires, and see how  many I can burn until they
blow, before I run out of gas...Just for fun!!

&gt; Rick:
&gt; Yes, they could stock the cooler AND make parts runs, because, of course,
their
&gt; buses would still be running and not NEED to be overhauled in the parking
lot
&gt; at Walmart.
&gt; Oh, they've had their share of problems with type 4's, but it's still the
best
&gt; bet.
