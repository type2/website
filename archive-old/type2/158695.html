Subject: Remote Oil Filter Kit Question 66 1600

I'm helping my dad with his 66 VW Bus with a 1600 engine in it. The
prior owner had put a remote oil filter set up in it, since the original
engine didn't have a filter, just the screen. The problem is he and now
my dad keep having problems with the kit. The hoses spring leaks every
so often, just this weekend getting a pinhole and causing a roadside
breakdown. So I'm telling my dad we have two choices, replace the plate
back to stock and just run with the screen (he drives less than 1K per
year on it) or see if there is a better filter solution, maybe one with
steel wires or one that would let us just screw a filter onto the engine
somewhere.

I was wondering if anyone had any set ups like this on a similar engine
and had any suggestions.
