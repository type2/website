&gt;  Is anyone else planning to bring kids to BNNTA?
&gt; I'm bringing two girls 10, and 12, and my son who is 14.
&gt; This will be their first bus campout and I want to make
&gt; sure that they enjoy it.
&gt;  We plan to leave the Milwaukee area Thursday evening
&gt; with some of the DBG folks.
&gt;  Feel free to p-mail us.
