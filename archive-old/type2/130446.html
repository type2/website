Subject: Re: [T2] windsheild installation

Paul.... a friend of mine and I replaced the glass on my '71,  We had success 
using 
a venetian blind cord. This was purchased at Walmart. It is bigger in diameter
than ordinary string or cord and allows you to get a good grip and pull hard 
to move that rubber over the metal.
