Subject: [T2] amatuer painted bus/vw art for sale

http://fullmoonbusclub_dot_com/modules.php?set_albumName=album42&amp;op=modload&amp;name=gallery&amp;file=index&amp;include=view_album.php
 
i have some art that i have been working on for a bit here,... nothing professionally but all very time consuming,...and bus/v dub related excpet maybe one or two..
all is priced reasonable i think for the time spent in each piece and for the amount of diffrent colors used.... most pictures may have been seen before online and thats where i painted most from... some are from pictures i got off thesamba_dot_com as well...
none are copies and have my own flavor added to them....others are from diffrent vw art found on the internet... wanted to paint something to the vw interest,,,
 
if interested please feel free to email me at volkzwagNman_at_yahoo_dot_com
thanks so much for looking...
 
all pieces have sale price in the file name under the picture shipping should'nt run no more than 3-5 dollars.prioritymail.. in the usa? not sure of overseas charges,,,fo all those overseas interested....,?
 
 
will consider a discount for possibles of more than one piece...
all are on 8 x 8 inch heavy pieces of tile... the pictures dont do justice for the shine that these hand painted arts have to them in person...
 
peace and love
chris
