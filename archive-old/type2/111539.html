Subject: Re: [T2] Question on how oil bath filters work

On Sat, 16 Aug 2003, Jon Wade wrote:

&gt; I just cleaned my oil bath filter.  Wasn't too bad.
&gt;
&gt; After I added 30 weight oil and reassembled it, I sucked air through the
&gt; outlet that leads to the carb. I expected to hear the air being sucked
&gt; through the oil. Like a bubbling sound or something.
&gt;
&gt; Instead, there wasn't really any noise, or resistance to indicate the
&gt; air was being drawn through the oil. Can anyone clue me in to the
&gt; function of the oil bath filter? Should I be hearing anything?

Jon,

The air does not go thru the oil and should not bubble (unless you way
overfill the filter.  The way an oil bath filter works is by forcing the
air to make a couple sharp turns, the most important of which is the one
at the bottom.  The neat thing is that the air molecules are very small
and light and can make those turns without trouble.  Particles of dirt are
*much* larger and heavier and basically skid off the track in the turn and
collide with the oil, where they are trapped.
