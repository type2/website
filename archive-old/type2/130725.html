Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Weekender for sale

Hi Clark,

GIVE US SYMPTOMS!!!! For crying out loud man, it might be as simple as 
a bad set of points.

Sorry you had to walk home, but that's where AAA coverage pays off.

Even a burned piston can be overcome, but if the problem turns out to 
be a wire off or a blocked fuel line you are throwing away good $$$.

You've been on this list long enough to know that we aren't gonna let 
you off that easily.


Happy trails,

&gt; 71 for sale. Engine lost power yesterday. I suspect a burned piston, 
&gt; but really don't know. If you have a spare 1600 dp lying around, it 
&gt; may be a good project for you. First $500. Contact me at
