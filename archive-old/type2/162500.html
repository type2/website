&gt; This is in sprinkled in the archives, but I know I have had 90k miles of
&gt; trouble free use of my Pertronix. I think they had a bad time where the
&gt; things just went south, but I have not heard of any problems with them
&gt; in the last few years. I'm a believer in them.

mine has about 30,000 on it but I am having a intermittent loss of power
problem that is driving me nuts,  has anyone heard of a Pertronix that
acted up intermittently??  I've always heard they either work or they
don't work nothing in between.   now as soon as I can find that .009 I
know is in the garage I think I will do a entire dizzy swap to see if that
has an effect....
