Subject: Re: [T2] broke down;(

Not knowing the year of your bus, it's kind of hard to say what the exact 
problem might be. However, I just went through an almost identical situation 
with my '70.

Here's the diagnosis to see what's up...

1. Remove rear hubcaps (if they're on there)

2. Start her up and put her in gear. Have a friend go around to the rear end 
on the passenger side.

3. Let the clutch out.

4. Have your friend watch the center hub on the wheel. Is it turning? If so, 
you've got a bad drum.

5. Not a bad drum? Okay. Have your friend watch the axles when you let the 
clutch out. If they turn, but the wheel hubs don't, it's CV joints.

Of course, this is only the case if you have drum brakes on the rear-end. 
Like I said, don't know the year of your bus so it's hard to tell.

Good luck...


Sean,

1970 Microbus (&quot;Mimi&quot;)
