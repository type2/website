Hi All.
Can anyone help me out with the reccommended Full throttle (W.O.T.) maximum 
advance that I should run?
I understand that the T1 engine has a max. setting of 32 deg full advanced , 
but is there a recommended maximun advance for the T4 engine?
My specs.
I have a 1974  Westfalia  1800 cc,  Manual Trans, Dual Carbs
Distributor: VW 021-905-205N, Bosch 0 231 181 005
Timing Set At: 10deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Right now it is advancing to 38 deg btdc at WOT.   Unfortunatly, I do not 
have a tach that goes over 2500 rpm.
Is this too far advanced?
Can I overheat the engine with this setting?
What should I set the Initial timing at to make sure that it does not 
advance too far?
TIA.

my ICQ# is 4652936
