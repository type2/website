Subject: Re: [T2] 411 Engine

Hi,
For those of you who have been asking about the 411
itself, it is a 2dr wagon with a 1.7 and auto tranny.
It's in better shape than you would expect for $500, I
just want to get rid of it so I can get the new westy
on the road. The reason I am considering the engine
transplant is because the 74 westy is the one I wrote
about with the sloppily installed beetle engine.
Thanks, 
Tyler
BTW I am located in Englewood,
Colorado

&gt; How easy would it be to install the engine out of a
&gt; 72
&gt; 411 into a 74 bus. Are there any differences in the
&gt; moustache bar mounting points n the case( like the
&gt; difference and beetle and 68-71 bus cases)? just
&gt; thought i'd ask since my bus needs and engine and
&gt; nobody seems to want to buy my $500 411.
&gt; Thanks,
