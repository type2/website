Subject: Re: [T2] Marvel Mystery Oil (was oil additive advise)

Tim sends:

&gt; I am not sure what is in it but I was introduced to Marvel Mystery Oil in
&gt; 1965. Since this product is still in business they gotta be doing something
&gt; correct.

I found the MSDS for Marvel Mystery Oil. MMO contains:

* at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-refined mineral oil&quot;
* at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-dewaxed mineral oil&quot;
* and no more than 30 percent Stoddard Solvent (mineral spirits)

That's all they listed. Motor oil with parts cleaner in it. Helluva concept,
and one that works extremely well.
