Subject: [T2] RE: Fan Shroud and flaps &amp; covers

FYI, the gaskets for the covers in question are very important (assuming you
have the covers installed).  Without them the covers will slowly but surely
carve their way through the softer metal of the fan shroud and eventually
cut a gap in it.  I know, it happened to me :(

For a cheap and easy solution that will last many years, get some of the
RUBBER weather stripping from Home Depot, cut to fit, clean the surface of
the covers very good, and stick in place.  NOTE: This is the RUBBER
stripping (with little grooves in it), NOT the grey foam-rubber stuff.

I did this on my 914 about 40K miles and 6 years ago and when I pulled the
motor last fall the rubber was still in place, still in tact, and still
doing its job.
