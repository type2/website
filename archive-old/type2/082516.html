&gt; hello-
&gt;
&gt; I am dismantling my '78 Bus (stock) for restoration &amp;
&gt; I have the dealer-installed AC system.  I plan to keep
&gt; the system, perhaps replacing the york with a sanden.
&gt; For now, I want to get the engine out and wonder how
&gt; to deal with the attached compressor.
&gt;
&gt; Can I detach the hoses from the top of the compressor
&gt; and drop the engine with compressor attached?

no.

&gt; Can I detach the compressor leaving the hoses attached
&gt; (bloody knuckles, for sure) from the engine and set it
&gt; aside in the left &quot;battery tray&quot; while I drop the
&gt; engine?

Best route.  This is what the pros do.

&gt; Is it common for AC repair shops to have a mobile
&gt; discharge unit that can come to my house and discharge
&gt; the AC system (cheaper than towing the Bus to a shop
&gt; for this operation)?

Never heard of this service.

George
