Subject: Re: [T2] heat exchanger &quot;rebuilding&quot;

Does anybody have any knoledge of or experience with 
those high temp ceramic exhasut coatings. Would that be 
safe to use on heat exchangers? Also, wouldn't some sort 
of coating such as cermaic of Por-15 make it &quot;safer&quot; to 
use the fiberglass wrap?
The guy that did the Rust, noise and heat website swore 
by the wrap, wonder how the boxes on that bus are 
holding up.

&gt; I have heard that the wrap is bad for long term durability of metal exhaust 
&gt; pipes.
&gt; 
&gt; Two reasons: it traps moisture when they are not in use and overheats the 
&gt; metal causing it to fail.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe instead use a double layer of metal or a wind break to keep the cold 
&gt; wind or road spray off of the metal. The elbow on the '78 exhaust system 
&gt; has a double layer of metal. On my friend's '78 the heater was excellent 
&gt; until about the time that this layer began rusting away.
&gt; 
&gt; Mere coincidence? I don't know but I cannot find any other reason for the 
&gt; system to lose heating capacity like it has.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I have pondered the thought of
&gt; &gt;wraping them in that fiberglass exhaust wrap that
&gt; &gt;people use to insulate their exhaust pipes.
