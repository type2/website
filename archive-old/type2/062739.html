Subject: Re: Stuck bus...something ain't right

&gt;tonight it happened again. same parking space. same thing. didn't happen at
&gt;my house...didn't happen anywhere else. what could this be? IBM gremlins?
&gt;i really don't think it's the parking brake, because even when the brake is
&gt;on, you can go forward without the amount of resistance i'm experiencing.
&gt;any ideas??

I've had this before: when the brakes are hot and wet, they will quickly
rust to the drum.  Strange, but true.  When I got my '56, we had this
problem trying to get it up on the tow truck, and I had it a couple other
times until I put new (thicker) shoes on.

Believe it, or not.
