Subject: Re: [T2] Please Help, woes of my 71 Camper

Thanks for all the replies and tips I've received on my little soap opera
brewing here in pennsyltucky.  From the replies I've received I've decided
to return on Friday and do the following:
1. check valves (we did adjust already)
2. check point gap again, use tach/dwell during short window of cold idle
3. set static timing to 5-7 btdc
4. check recheck for vacuum leaks (carb to manifold and manifold to heads
right?)  all ports are blocked on carb
5.  pray

some had asked a few further questions;
the tank was drained fresh 93 octane added
the carb 30/31 is new
brake booster not hooked up (this will need adressed)
009 is not my choice will def get a more appropriate dizzy if we ever get
road worthy
this is a 1600 upright single port
anyone in the Johnstown PA area?

(quick digression....   my old motor would get hot at highway speeds but
be fine around town until its demise -dp 1600-  I have the old dizzy to
this motor and it turns out it is from a late model bus 74-76 I think. 
According to what I've recently read this dizzy provides way too much
advance for an upright 1600, like 45 degrees.  Would this cause highway
heating?  I never had a temp gauge but I did get the berg dipstick idiot
light thing that popped on at a certain temp, pop on it did while cruising
highway speeds for more than 5-7 minutes -55 mph ish-  Is this likely?)
