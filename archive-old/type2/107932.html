Subject: LiMBO on Long Island report

Hi All,
    This past weekend the Bus Alliance put on the 3rd annual LiMBO on
Long Island.  In reality it was organized by Andrea and Brad, and I
want to say &quot;Thank You&quot; to the both of them for all their hard work.
    There were 16 buses coming to Long Island from an area that
extended from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania, and all states in
between.  Splitties, Bays, Vanagons and Eurovans were all represented.
And as diverse as the buses were, so were the people.  In fact it's
the people that make these campouts so much fun !   Nothing like
spending a weekend with friends, old and new.  Despite the rain on
Saturday it was one good relaxing weekend.  The campfire started early
Saturday and was still a blaze when the rain ended somewhere around
midnight.
    I've put up a few photos of the event at
http://photos.yahoo_dot_com/lihikers    Once you get there just click on
the album titled LiMBO on Long Island.
