&gt; 	Does a high Hc reading mean to rich or to lean

High HC indicates either a too-rich mixture, or an engine that is
missing (due either to a ignition problem or a too rich or lean
mixture).  If your engine is idling smoothly, try leaning the mixture
a bit (but not enough to roughen the idle).  It is also helpful to run
the idle speed up as high as you can get away with for the test.
