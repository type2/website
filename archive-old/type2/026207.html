	PADME(71' Westy) does that too(the GEN light thing) all except the
light at
	high rpms. After reading the segment in the Muir manual I came to
the
	conclusion that the since the idle speed is supposed to be set to
run just
	fast enough to keep the light on then it would make sense to me that
when
	there is extra draw on the electrical system then the light would
light up
	temporarily. I have progressed from this point with the thought that
if the
	light doesn't stay on or get bright enough to really be &quot;LIT&quot; up
then I keep
	on going and it has always gone out(out in the sense that the dim
light
	coming from it stops when I begin to move(or slightly rev the
engine). But
	if it stays on I would definately be more worried. If anyone else
has any
	info on this please let us know as I would hate to be causing damage
to her
	charging/electrical system based upon my ignorance.

The dull red light syndrome is very common in 6 volt VWs and will eventually
lead to a host of problems -- all of them expensive (regulator, generator,
battery, etc) -- by making your charging system work harder.  After forking
out $150 for a new ignition switch for my Type 3 Ghia I decided to get
proactive.  The problem is with resistance in the electrical circuits.  It
usually boils down to poor connections on either the hot or the ground side
of the circuit.  The ground is easy to fix by cleaning the contact surfaces
-- but there are a lot of them to fix (all over the car).  A poor connection
on the hot side can many times be traced to a butt connector that you or the
P/O installed.  This method of repair creates problems especially on the fat
red wires.  The correct repair method is to braid the strands together and
then solder (sp.) the braid and then put shrink wrap over it.  To braid you
divide the strands in half (on each wire), twist 1 half to the other wire
half, then wrap the other halves in the opposite direction from the first
halves.
