Subject: Con-Fused

HI All,  Found out something interesting about the wiring this morning
on one of my bugs.  Yeah, I know it's not a type 2, but I think everyone
will be interested in this.  I was, and still am, having the hot Generator
problem.  Apparently, if the generator is hot it means that the current
is getting lost somewhere, so the Generator has to 'work' harder to keep
up the voltage.  So I decided that maybe if I took all the fuses out and
put them in one by one I might figure it out.  Well,  would you believe
that the car will run and function without any fuses in it? =:O  I AM
getting closer to the solution ... at least the generator didn't get hot
when no fuses were in there :)  This is a '72 bug.  I don't think the
buses will run without at least the one fuse going to the coil.  I wonder...
if the bug will run without any fuses does that mean the main power wire
coming off the voltage regulator is shorted to the circuit that has the
coil on it?  Hoboy 8(  I'm still on it.  This is an area in which we
really need some discussion.  I have had this problem for weeks now,
without any answers, only more questions.  If I come up with any answers
I'll be posting them pronto.

Drive On,
