Subject: Re: [T2] Various seals for the floorboard

AFAIK the function of the brake and clutch pedal seals you have described 
is correct. I presume the logic was that you only use the pedals a lot at 
low speed so the air coming in is minimal. My bus has an &quot;after market&quot; PO 
feature on the clutch pedal. It is a block of rubber with a hole cut in it 
for the pedal to go through, stuck to the floor on the cabin side! Very 
effective.

The standard clutch/brake pedal seals are the same as the ones that seal 
the spark plug holes in the tinware.

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
