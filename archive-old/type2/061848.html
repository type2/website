&gt; I would try some windshield washer Anti-freeze with de-icer.I feel
this would not tant the tank as much as regualar anti-freeze. Tell me
what you think though. Thanks Happy Hoildays

I don't know if this has been covered previously in this thread, but
before anyone poisons themselves or others they should check with
their local RV supplier.  They should carry antifreeze specifically
made for potable water systems.  I wouldn't use anything else in these
systems!
