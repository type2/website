I put curtains in this weekend as well. Owing to Bachelors Education in HS
(where i won the betty crocker award) I am quite handy with a sewing
machine. Yes I endured the ridicule of all but It took me about 1/2 a day
to Make the curtains. Install New Rods and curtains and almost begin to
admire when a dogfight broke out in the back yard and pretty much ruined
what was going to be a good weekend. I did get the curtains finished
late that night 
It only took about 6 1/2 yards of fabric to do all sides and rear and
tiebacks with enough left to make a curtain between the cab and rear. I
used upholstery fabric it was thick so no doubling cost about 3.50 a yard
though. 
Total cost 
50.00 curtain rods and parts 
25.00 fabric and thread 
2800.00 Daschsund Repair
Note a fight between a 10 lb Doxie and a 75 lb Lab get get expensive.
