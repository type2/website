&gt; Can anyone comment on the effectiveness of front and rear sway bars and wind? My

&gt; have heard that aftermarket sway bars make a world of difference too....

I found that a wider tire helps some, not to mention making sure of the
basics, tire inflation, alignment, tight steering, good shocks etc
