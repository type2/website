You'll never know the answer to your questions until you have the engine 
opened up.  If the mechanic who did the compression test is competent (an 
unknown) then he can tell the difference between low compression due to 
head problems vs. ring seating problems.

As far as just doing rings vs. a complete P&amp;C replacement, it's been 
reported that the VW engine doesn't take well to simply replacing the 
rings, unlike most American iron.  Has to do with the way these engines 
wear; the cylinders end up somewhat egg-shaped, so new rings don't seat 
well and soon wear out themselves.

The idiot lights should light up when the engine is first started, then 
go out with a little blip of the throttle (battery and oxs/egr) or when 
pressure builds (oil.)  If the lights come on at startup, then they are 
probably working.

&gt; Here's the situation on which I'd like your opinion:  Current owner bought
&gt; the bus in August for his brother in Wisconsin.  On the way back from Nevada
&gt; to where he lives in California he &quot;noticed it had low compression.&quot;  (This
&gt; guy admits he is not very mechanical at all.)  He took it into a shop where
&gt; the mechanic did a compression test &amp; said it needs &quot;a head to get by, and
&gt; while it's down you might as well replace the other one as well.&quot;  I asked a
&gt; Type IV guy about this.  He said the reason these motors usually have low
&gt; compression is because the rings aren't seating well on the cylinder walls
&gt; because of overheating.    OK, so now I'm wondering about overheating, so I
&gt; ask the current owner about idiot lights.  He says neither the heat light
&gt; nor the oil pressure light came on during his 600 mile drive.  (I wondered
&gt; about the oil pressure reasoning that if the engine overheated the oil may
&gt; break down &amp; symptoms of driving in this condition may show up in loss of
&gt; pressure in worn crank mains.)  Current owner also says he has no idea if
&gt; the idiot lights work, but everything else in the bus electrically is ok.
&gt; 
&gt; So, here's what I'm thinking.  I fly out to CA planning to drop the engine,
&gt; replace both heads, &amp; while everythings down  I might as well do the
&gt; cylinders, pistons &amp; rings as well to knock out all possibilities in the
&gt; compression diagnosis.
&gt; 
&gt; Is all that necessary?  I suspect the heads since the mechanic said only one
&gt; was necessary reportedly because both cylinders were low.  This would lead
&gt; me away from rings obviously.  But supposing all 4 are low due to
&gt; overheating &amp; ring seating trouble, can I just break the cylinder glaze &amp;
&gt; install new rings?  Or do you think I should just do the whole shmeal.
&gt; Anything I can look for that would indicate much further problems than just
&gt; low compression that would make me cut my losses &amp; take the bus home?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
