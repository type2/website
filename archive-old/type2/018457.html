        Sounds like your beam is not adjusted properly -- check Bentley
-- it's supposed to be square with the engine and frame.  Yes you can
put a jack under the engine and loosen the beam. The beam is adjusted by
loosening the bolts that hold it to the frame, slide it back and forth
on each side to get it square.
