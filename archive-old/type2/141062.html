Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Rattle can epoxy primer

After spending a bunch o' dough on this expensive epoxy primer (I did the 
exterior of my bus above the belt-line and the interior) my bodyman (a true 
resto guy who restored a couple of cars for Dan Akryod and - who is doing 
below the beltline of my bus) tells me that he does not use epoxy primer - 
he says he only uses etching primer - he says that epoxy primer is very 
hard - but it doesn't etch into the metal.  It sits on top of the metal and 
once chipped metal can rust underneath the epoxy primer - but, so he says, 
with etching primer once it is chipped or scratched - the part exposed will 
rust but not the metal adjacent to the scratch.  Me - I donno! But I have 
seen cars that he restored 15 years ago and they look very good today.
