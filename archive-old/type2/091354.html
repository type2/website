Subject: Re: Fwd: Re: [T2] Sump plate was Re: Hi

Richard,

For a picture of what the 914 sump plate with oil temps sender looks like,
go to:

http://www.everybus_dot_com/dworkin/steve/misc2/

and look at the 914plate jpegs.  Note that if you find and install one of
these senders, you will have to trim your dipstick a bit as they hit each
other.

Also there are pictures of my oil pressure sender installation.  The dual
oil pressure sender i use is just a *hair* larger than the hole in the
tin, so I clearanced it with a die grinder.  Factory lookin' ain't it? :-)
