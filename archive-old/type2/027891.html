Excuse me for saying so, but that seems like a dangerously obvious place for 
a spare-key stash (IMHO).  I say this out of concern, not scorn.

Then again, I'm a &quot;distributor, don't go on long backpacking trips w/out it 
(in a ziploc bag)&quot; kind of guy (when weight permits - I'm sure there's any 
easier way, but I'm slow in that regard) who carries an extra set of keys 
secreted away somewhere on his person/gear (and sometimes will give an 
additional set to travelling companion).

Ciao,

I keep a spare set of keys inside the hatch where the oil goes and the
license plate is.
