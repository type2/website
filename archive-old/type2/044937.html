Subject: [T2] oil dip stick tube

Hello everyone,

 I'm in desperate need of a oil dip stick tube!!!! I need on that will fit
an 82 V'gon Westy 2.0 L aircooled. This is the last thing I need to get the
motor ready to be reinstalled and get going to BNNTA!!!

Anyone in the OKC area that has one, please let me know!!
