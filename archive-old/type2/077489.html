Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

Thanks everyone for the feedback...  Looks like I am going to have to take
measurements to be sure, but here is what I got from Beat Street, one of the
aftermarket ragtop companies out there:
&quot;You have a Westfalia conversion. This is a collectable Camper and putting a
ragtop in it will decrease its value. However if you still want to put a
ragtop in it you will have to weld a new roof section in. Sorry &quot;
Now someone else here said that the '70 model is based on the ragtop...  I'm
more inclined to believe this group of Type2 fans, than I am that company
because it took 3 emails to get that answer from them.  Anyway, if the
ragtop measures out to just fit in, I still may just weld a new patch in
place of the hole.  Sounds like the water issue may be more trouble than I
can stand.   Thanks again everyone for the help.

Soon to be '70 Westy.
...or maybe '70 ex-Westy?




&gt; There's a company here that makes aftermarket ragtops,
&gt; but I can't say I'd recommend them, since the two
&gt; installations I've seen sag badly.

&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; can tell you that there are a couple of firms that
&gt; &gt; make ragtop style sunroofs for buses that formerly
&gt; &gt; had
&gt; &gt; poptops.

&gt; &gt; Surely someone here knows of a company that does
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; in the US.
&gt; &gt; :-)
