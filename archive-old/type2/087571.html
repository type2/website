Subject: VW roof rack

Hi,

I met a fellow at EB ( I think he was a pal of MadDog.) and we talked 
about a rack I have for for an a Golf A2/A3 but could be applied to a 
bus with the right crossbars. The rack mounts to square VW cross bars 
and will also fit square Thule bars. He was really interested in it 
but I never got contact info to him.

If you are out there get in touch with me. If anyone else is 
interested you can view a pic of the rack( does not include cross 
bars or towers shown in picture) at
http://drivergear.vw_dot_com/vw_assets/images/product/2241.jpg

This will not fit A4 cross bars without modification but will easily 
fit any Thule square bars if you already have some of those on your 
bus.

I will entertain offers but am not interested in shipping it. It is 
currently located in Greensboro, NC.

Thanks
