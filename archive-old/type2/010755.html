Yes, fellow bussers, it was a defunct clutch cable. It is all fixed and I am
back on the road. We replaced the cable and the bowden tube but I need the
&quot;bell crank at pedal end.&quot; I am going to look in the manuals and figure what
the heck it is and then figure out where to find one.

Thanks to all you listees who took the time to write. This a great community
of people and you've made owning Vandela a real pleasure. Just wait until it
is new engine time. Then we'll really have some fun!
