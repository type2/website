Subject: Re: [T2] Help: tranny mount bolts stripped

Thanks to those who offered advice on my &quot;stuck&quot; tranny mount bolts.
As it turns out, I spent that evening looking through the used Bentley book
(that I had just received a couple of days before) and it mentioned &quot;Captive
nuts&quot;, and all of a sudden something clicked.  Those nuts weren't stuck at
all, they were just welded in place!!  All I had to do was attack the bolt
heads (from the other side, not as practical) and they eventually came off
nicely.  Oddly, one had a 15mm head on it, and the other a 17mm head.  Had
to remove the starter to get access to the one on that side.
John Cloonan's advice on dealing with stuck bolts may yet serve me when I
deal with a real stuck nut (as opposed to trying to unscrew a captive nut -
duh!)
Good news is that tranny is out, no harm to tools/tranny/human.  It sits in
my garage awaiting cleaning/inspection this winter, while the bus got
covered with first snowfall in the driveway, this morning (got it out just
in the nick of time!)
