Dave,

When I ordered these belts, I asked repeatedly to make sure they bolt
into the original holes, and no extra drilling was necessary.  And I was
told repeatedly that these mounted in the stock holes and no other holes
were necessary.

I'm a guessin' that the retractor part is going to be mounted over my
left shoulder (when I am the driver), the non-retracting end will be
bolted into the hole by the door bottome and it will latch as usual in
the center.  These things are supposed to come with all necessary
installing hardware . . .

We'll see.

Don't have a scanner but will try to describe accurately how they mount
in the van.

Thanks for the good wish!

Lauria
