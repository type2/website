Subject: RE: [T2] Eliminating Test Plug &amp; Extra Wires

Tom I have been pondering that same thing. PO on my bus has already clipped 
several of them. Including the Big Red/White one. I don't know about you but 
I am not planning on making this bus exactly stock, and never ever plan on 
taking it to the dealership from them to plug into the test unit. If anyone 
out knows please share. Will removing the test block completely with wires 
create any adverse effects?

&gt;From: &quot;Thomas&quot; I'm in the middle of sorting out and organizing my wiring 
&gt;system... The engine
&gt;compartment could be spagetti with a little marinara sauce.  I have lot's 
&gt;of
&gt;wires for a non-existing AC compressor and all those test plug wires.  I'm
&gt;trying to simplify everything and want to eliminate any wires which are
&gt;unnessary.  The engine compartment looks great with the new Dove Blue paint
&gt;and single Weber.  I'm using bright yellow for wiring looms!  Can I cut and
&gt;cap all the wires going to the old test port and remove the unit?  I have a
&gt;full color wiring diagram and I'm not seeing where it would make a 
&gt;difference
&gt;in eliminating the entire thing?
&gt;Has anyone done this?
