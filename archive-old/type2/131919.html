Subject: Re: [T2] Metalurgy Question

Ran outside an put a magnet on the shell. It stuck, maybe not as strongly as
it did when I put it on the flange. Guess it's not 409 stainless

  the shell of most cats are 409 stainless.  409 stainless is non-magnetic
  so you can test it by putting a magnet on it.
