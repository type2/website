Subject: Re: Dbl Cab Canvas

I have seen them for as little as $400.00 (missing parts/not mint)to as
much as $2000.00 for a mint example. Since I have everyones attention, does
anybody know of or have for sale an after market &quot;canvas top&quot; for single
cab. These where made in the early to late '80's the canvas was actually a
vinyl or pvc material ant the top was flush with the cab, not 12&quot; or so
over the cab as the original.

thanks V

&gt;Hey Gang,

&gt;I just came across an N.O.S. Canvas top for my 68 Dbl Cab including the 
&gt;hoops(hardware).  My question to the list is how much would you Double Cab 
&gt;owners be willing to pay for this set-up?  I don't have it for sale but I 
&gt;just want to know that what I am paying is in the ballpark.
&gt;
&gt;Trying to avoid a ripoff,
