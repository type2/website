Subject: Re: [T2] Engine replacement (long)

One more thing I should probably already know:

My engine is a 1700, no smog, carbs. I know the engines are pretty much the
same, except in 78/79 the different exhaust. (I think)

Assuming I get a rebuilt from AVP, can I just order an 1800 engine, even
though it has the holes in the head and is made for a smog pump? Do we just
plug the holes? Would it be smarter to just get the exact same 1700 engine?

I was also looking at the 2000cc long block with hydraulic lifters. Seems
like a lot of people (including Boston Bob) think thats the way to go. What
besides the exhaust would I have to get/change?
http://www.avp-worldwide_dot_com/engines.htm
I have been reading the archives on hydraulic lifters and I wonder if
getting a rebuilt cam and lifters is ok or should I try to get new ones put
in?

Whats the difference between a 78 and 79 engine?

Thanks for so much help!!!

&gt; Ok   I am going to try and decipher what Bob said. Apparently its not the
&gt; jetting (although I have heard thats wrong too), but rather the
&gt; &quot;progressive&quot; part. When at idle only one bbl feeds the gas, but as you
&gt; accelerate then they both do. He is saying that wears out your engine. He
&gt; suggests retrofitting fuel injection (and tranny, etc.) from a 79 bus. He
&gt; will warrant with dual carbs. He doesn't recommend the progressive weber
&gt; though. Here is a pic of my centermount weber:
&gt; http://www.72camper_dot_com/spiff12.jpg which is so readily available and much
&gt; more affordable even at around $300. I have seen many buses with this
setup,
&gt; but I think I will switch, especially with 0 miles on a new rebuilt.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hope I got that right.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Boston Bob ... doesn't give a warranty for an
&gt; &gt; engine with the weber carb on it. ...At the least I
&gt; &gt; would need new dual carbs for a warranty.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He won't warrant an engine with a weber progressive or
&gt; &gt; any weber?  Will warrant Dellortos?  New dual carbs
&gt; &gt; means stock or any dual carbs?  I thought all
&gt; &gt; aftermarket carbs were jetted wrong for VW
&gt; &gt; applications and need to be properly jetted.  Is the
&gt; &gt; progressive completely incapable of being jetted
&gt; &gt; properly?
&gt; &gt;
