Subject: Re: [T2] Push rod tub seals - uh oh.

My engine is a 2000cc and the inner rings are looser in the groves on the
inners. They seem to have about a 1/16&quot; inch of float within the grove
(probably less) but they seal OK.
Maybe you've got the wrong seals or old inventory that has dried out.

&gt; &gt; You can expand the ring groves and they will fit properly.
&gt; &gt; Some books reccomend sealing the O rings and others never mention 
&gt; it.
&gt; &gt; Take your choice, either method works.
&gt; 
&gt; Somehow I don't think that's the problem--it seems like the rings 
&gt; are
&gt; rattling around in the grooves.
