Subject: FS in near future: 82 &amp; 84 Automatic Vanagons

Hi all,

I'm operating in Vanagon overload!  I have 2 automatic Vanagons that will
be available soon.  If anybody is interested in them as-is, that can be
worked out too.  I'm in the Kansas City Area.

'82 Passenger Vanagon.  90,000 miles, purchased from the original owner.
Cloth interior, two tone blue, a few minor dents, ok tires, good driver.
$950  (air-cooled)

'84 Standard Passenger Vanagon.  123,000 miles, fresh head gaskets, new
brakes, red with black vinyl interior, nice red carpeting.  Couple dents,
decent tires, non-working AC, good driver.  $1500 obo  (water-cooled)

I need to sell these!!!
