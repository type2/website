Subject: RE: [T2] Insurance issues &amp; questions

I had a similar sort of accident with similar numbers. They &quot;totaled&quot; it
at $2800 and let me keep it for $1000 salvage value.  I ended up with a
check for $1800, kept my old van, kept my title as it was...made my own
repairs.  Nothing else changed.  I signed a release form of some sort
and that was it.  Maybe things vary from state to state, but &quot;totaling&quot;
isn't necessarily a legal status. More of an actuarial thing.
