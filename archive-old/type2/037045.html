Subject: Rebuild Jitters!

Hi everyone!

 So my engine's in pieces inside the bus. I've got the case split and the
crank out, all to replace the fried bearings.

 I guess I'll start at the beginning...

 First of all, this is what I'm dealing with :

 1971 Bus
 1600 DP
 34P3 Carb
 Vacuum advance distributor
 No non-stock modifications

 In the beginning, I pulled the engine to replace a head which had dropped
its #4 exhaust and intake valve seats. The engine still ran fine at that
point, although I could tell it was on its way out. Compression of
100,75,75,25 in 1,2,3,4 order. So that took me a month or so to get done.

 When I put it all back together, it ran great. Excellent power, high
compression between 110-125 in all cylinders.

 It ran for a couple hundred miles, and then... the spark plug hole on the
1,2 head (the other side) cracked and out popped the plug.

 Okay.

 So I ordered a new head and pulled the engine again to replace it. Got it
in, back together, back in the bus. Driving, seemed fine. All of a sudden I
heard this horrible screaming-weazing sound as I was driving down the road.
At first I couldn't figure it out, but then I found it was a vacuum leak
coming from the 3,4 manifold as it would only happen with manifold pressure.

 So I pulled the engine again (getting real good at it at this point) and
rebuilt the left side. Got it back in. Weazing is gone.

 Hmm. Now my engine's overheating and losing power after driving for five
minutes or so. After trying this and that and reassembling here and there,
it wouldn't go away. Finally, I saw some metal in my oil. Nice thin slivers.
At this point, I figure that my bearings have been fried, as I'm hearing a
nice rhythmic click as the engine turns over. A click that was certainly not
there before. Smoke would come out of the case after being run for a little
while. Certainly the engine felt much more hot when feeling near the exhaust
pipes. Also, when watching distributor advance using a strobe timing light,
it didn't appear to advance. The little it did seemed erratic.

 And I'm also assuming at this point that my oil passages must be clogged
with all kinds of metallic gunk as well.

 So I pulled the engine again and slowly disassembled it over the course of
two months or so.

 Which brings me up to today. It's been sitting there for a good month or
two since I got it open. As I've been hitchhiking, it's hard to get a
crankshaft and case down town to the machine shop for work. But now I've got
a car at my disposal and feel ready to get started on this again... but!

 I've got a bad case of the jitters! There seems to be so many things that
don't exactly fall in the realm of &quot;common sense&quot; when rebuilding an engine.
So I need some support.

 First of all, any comments on the above problems? To summarize, at the end
it was :

 1. overheating
 2. non-advance
 3. &quot;clicking&quot; or &quot;knocking&quot; sound, sounding like it's coming from each
rotation of a single cylinder. In other words, once every four strokes.
 4. metal in the oil

 Second of all, what do I need the machine shop to do for me? What I'm
assuming now is,

 1. Mic the crank and the case to see how much if any wear is there which
would tell me what size bearings to buy.
 2. Clean the case and oil passages of all metal deposits.

 And third of all, what must I watch for when rebuilding which wouldn't
normally fall under the heading of &quot;common sense&quot;? I'm a fairly intelligent
guy, but not an engineer by any means.

 I've got Hoover's sermons, the idiots guide, haynes, and bentleys books for
light reading, and adequate tools for at least getting the damn thing apart,
and I would hope for getting back together for the most part, other than the
high torque needed for the flywheel (which is still attached to the crank
cause I couldn't get the damn thing off) and for the pulley nut.

 So please! I know that I can do this, but I need just that litle bit of
extra help that I hope this list can provide. I've been lurking on and off
for a year or two now, and am thankful to you all for contributing to create
such a valuable resource.

 Aloha, and thanks for your help!

 Ian
