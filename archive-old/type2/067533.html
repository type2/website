&gt;No, didn't see that one, but I noticed one (I think it was a breadloaf, red
&gt;&amp; white) in a Sears tire commercial. (Went by REALLLY fast)  And I saw one
&gt;go by in the background  when we recently rented &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;. (Had to
&gt;use rewind &amp; slo-mo to see it.)

There's also an early bus in the commercial for those little recordable
disc things.  At the very beginning, just a quick shot of the side and then
a front shot of it driving down the road.  Blue and white I think...
