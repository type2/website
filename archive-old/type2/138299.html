It's illegal to use cats from junked buses, and the yards won't sell 
them.

However, it's pretty easy to take a universal cat and make the cuts 
(with a hacksaw) for the appropriate bends, and get that welded up. (I 
did it, and the welder at the muffler shop was really impressed!) One 
thing that could go on the website (great idea, Ben) is a pattern that 
you could print out, cut, and trace onto the universal cat to do the 
cuts right.
