Subject: engine Wires

I am just about ready to install my motor in my 70 bus. I do not have my
Bentley's yet, it is on the way though. So until it gets here, I need to ask
the list my (what I hope to be) simple questions.

How many wires should there be going to the motor?
I have found 4.
one is for the backup lights.
The other 3 I am unsure of.
One is GREEN    It is by itself on the passenger side.
The next two are in a sleeve together.
One of those is BLACK
The other is GREEN &amp; BLUE

Please help me to identify where they go.

Also any more help on the VR would be greatly appreciated.
Everybus here I come ( I HOPE )
Later,
Jim
