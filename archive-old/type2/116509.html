Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Cover

I got my current cover from Bus Depot.  Previous to that, I had one from
Wolfsburg West.  I like the fabric of the Wolsburg West cover better than
that of the Bus Depot cover, but, unfortunately, it did not fit my Westy due
to the extra height of the pop top.  That said, the Bus Depot cover fits
well and is holding up fine, and it does a great job keeping my bus clean
and dry.
