X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Good morning Volks,
  Official count is 43 westies/buses.. mostly westies with
one amazing family of 4 from Canada (central BC) who made a
9 hour drive in a bug.8-O
  34 camped for the night and 16 caravaned over to the main
lot for the show (the road cow was left to graze for a
while in the field).
  It was great to see you all again, and some of you for
your first Wet Westy event! Once again Bev amazed us all
with the amount of goodies she can carry in her weekender!
Jim's dog, &quot;Misfit&quot; kept us all entertained chasing his
tail non stop all weekend. &quot;Brian&quot; the youngest and our
local &quot;drop in&quot; was also great at the &quot;campfire&quot;!
  I hope those of you who came via the type2 list will sign
on with the Wet Westy list so that you can keep up with all
the other events.
  Ahhh yes, the $16 dollar fee was steep for what you got
facility wise.... but the company was priceless! It was
good to see Fred again! 

   Gotta run Volks... was fun!

Regular naps prevent old age.....
especially if you take them while driving.
