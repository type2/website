Hiya all ,,i had a page up on replacing Doc Ric's nose skin with a 73 up 
replacement skin on a 71 and the mods that had to be done ,,i rotate the pics 
monthly but if need i can try to repost in a place and leave it up if ya'll 
want or i can re scan the pics and send to the people who want them,,,,Ken 
??,,comments anyone ??on the nose replacements which orginate from RMMW you 
have the flange lip on the outter edges on the bay nose panel that is ,,,,but 
you have to move the turn and parking lights back to bottom ,,and in spite of 
what the people say that nose is not the complete nose from top to bottom you 
have to add a peice at the bottom ,,maybe my definition of full nose is 
different ,i dunno anyway if ya'll want the pics yell ,i have them in a photo 
book and can rescan ,,later
