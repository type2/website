Subject: while were on the subject..tires

    Due to the added height of my AdventureWagen I am concerned about the
handling. Since my engine is &quot;gimped&quot; (read: #3 knocks like a bastard) I
have yet to take him down the ole road and take some mean ass curves were
all known for doing!!! In any event I was wondering about a extender of
sorts to shoot my tires out a little further. Not amazingly further where it
looks like Im ready to throw on the curb feelers and &quot;chrome nudes&quot;
mudflaps, but just enough to give me a little added handling in turns and
such.
    Ive heard horror stories of almost riding on two wheels on the highway
when a big wind hits and all that. Is this something I should be concerned
with? Is it feasible to add width to my wheel base? I dont recall what tire
size I had put on Blue when we took him for new shoes but the guy at the
tire place said I had the widest tires on that would fit already( although
they look like normal everyday VW size tires. Its too dark to go poke around
now.. ) Any thoughts would be beautiful as always
thanks all
Steve
