&gt; 15: For an even smaller price you can buy one of the Bosch RPM limiting
&gt; rotors
&gt; 16: Steven Dolan described, here are some numbers:
&gt; 17:
&gt; 18: 1 234 332 144  &gt;5400 RPM normally used in T4 engines
&gt; 19: 1 234 332 192  &gt;4500 RPM normally used in 1600 Baywindows
&gt; 20: 1 234 332 314  &gt;4800 RPM normally used in 1600 'Export' Baywindows
&gt; 21: 1 234 332 207  &gt;5800 RPM normally used in 4-cyl 914s
&gt; 22:
&gt; 23: You can select one of the above to fit your stock (either T1 or T4) or
&gt; 009
&gt; 24: distributor. if you have a T4 in your '74 i'd recommend the &gt;5400, this
&gt; one
&gt; 25: is also good for the performance oriented Bus owner who has a better
&gt; than stock
&gt; 26: rebuilt engine with CW crank, for a stock 1600 i'd use the &gt;4800 or a
&gt; &gt;5000 from
&gt; 27: another car, Saab maybe.
&gt; 
&gt;  So this suggests that the &quot;redline&quot; for a pancake should be a bit under
&gt; 5400, as
&gt; the limiter is usually set a little higher than the tach. If I work the
&gt; numbers for
&gt; my '77 devon it comes in at 5000rpm = ~90mph, reinforcing the idea expressed
&gt; on
&gt; this list before that you can't overrev a baywindow in top gear without a
&gt; long,
&gt; steep hill and/or a tailwind!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;          W.
List:
I once had a 78 bus that melted its exhaust valves soon after I bought
it. Needing to get the car back on the road, I bought a rusty 411 and
transferred all the bus FI, distributor, and other parts onto the 411
engine. This was an 80? horse 1700 engine AW code maybe, had 8.5 to 1
compression ratio the exact same motor as a 1.7 Porsche 914. I used the
5400 cut out rotor from the 2.0 engine. That thing would rev so quickly
in 1st and 2nd gear, that it would smack me against the steering wheel
when it was cutting out. It got to be annoying so I changed it to the
solid rotor. I know when to shift. No tach. It's cool to have a tach and
I would sure like to put one on my 82 diesel Vanagon, but I don't need
it to tell when to shift. About the horsepower peak if you're in a hurry
and the torque peak when in enjoy the view, save the fuel mode.
I think the rotor should be matched to the camshaft grind you're using
(which, more than anything else, determines the personality of your
engine). Type 4 engines used 2 basic grinds: 72's, manual trans, 73's
and 74's used the hotter cams on busses, all 914's 411's 412's 912E's
used it as well. Automatic trans 73, 74's  and all 76 and later use a
cam that has milder intake event. I can't remember about 75's. From 78
on this same profile is SLIGHTLY modified to use hydraulic lifters (it
no longer has clearance ramps). It is for timing and lift purposes, the
same cam. The hotter cam  could make good use of the 5800 rpm rotor.
I'd guess those engines have horsepower peaks somewhere around
5100-5200.
The softer cam could make good use of the 5400 rpm cut out rotor. My 80
owners manual lists it as 67 SAE hp at 4700 rpm. 
(Incidentally the 912E engine was a strange bird indeed using the big
cam, 7.6 to 1 compression ratio, bigger port heads, 42 intakes 36
exhausts like a 914 2.0, but instead using  AFC injection with bigger
parts than a bus. It used NO cut out rotor, instead using fuel pump cut
out built into the injection instead. I do not know the speed of that
cut out, but I would guess it to be 5500-5800.)
I would think, that with these rotors selected, under proper use, one
would never know it was there. IOW, one would never need to rev a stock
2.0 to 5400 rpm, 700 rpm past its horsepower peak.
It would certainly  protect an engine from a novice driver or one with a
tin ear!
