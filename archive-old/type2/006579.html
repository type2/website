Thats correct, it was, but only on dual carb models....The switch is in the
engine bay, kinda left center, and works off the nose cone, almost like a
back up light switch..

Subject: [T2] Existential Vac Advance question


&gt; I just read on page 73 of Bentley's Engine &amp; Clutch chapter that the vac
&gt; advance had a temperature switch and was cut off in all but 4th gear at 54
&gt; degrees.
&gt;
&gt; Well, like every other up to date VW person I have gotten religion on the
&gt; subject of vac advance, and its superior ability to respond to load not
just
&gt; RPM.  Now I find that  (at least here in the balmy latitudes) it was
turned
&gt; off most of the time.  Saint Hoover save us!  Should I doubt my faith?
Can
&gt; I spend that $400 I was saving for a Mallory vac advance dizzy on slow
women
&gt; and fast gin?
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
&gt; Grant
