Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Starvation?

Hey all,

Confirmed one more possible source of the fuel starvation issues, at 
least on Dual Carb Type4 engines, fuel pump.

As I believed I mentioned (more than) a few times in the past, I've had 
an intermittant (sp?) fuel starvation problem when out on the highway for 
the past 3 years, rarely played up in town, but out on the highway with 
on-going high fuel flow requirements, it always played up to some extent, 
merely irritating stumbles sometimes, choking it down to 50 KPH uphill on 
EVERY hill others (which makes for a very slow trip when communting the 
300 KMs between my home in Sydney and work in Canberra every week).

Anyway, we went through all the electricals, minor improvement, I spent 
nearly $1000 getting &quot;the best&quot; VW specialists outside Sydney to rebuild 
the carbs and find the problem (once  again, minor improvement, 
frustrating after all the money I spent with them), and the only things 
not replaced or supposedly fixed were the fuel pump and fuel tank, given 
that the fuel tank was put in 5 years ago (by MY VW specialists, who I 
trust far more), and I didn't feel like pulling the engine to get the 
tank out, I checked the fuel pump this weekend, gettin' the pump off 
my &quot;spare&quot; '79 dual carb engine for parts was a bit of a nightmare, so I 
just pulled the &quot;head&quot; off the '74 fuel pump first, to have a look, an 
indication that it was part of the problem were the metal parts that came 
out with the fuel when I pulled it off. 

Anyway, to TRY and shorten this, the cut-off valve/diaphram had failed to 
some degree about 3 years ago, the nylon(?) shaft had totally 
disappeared, as had the diaphram if that's what it was (manual doesn't 
actually show it), all that was left in there was the metal spring, and 
the metal cup, and it appeared that the metal cup was getting sucked into 
the recess it used to reside in and cut the fuel off to some degree (not 
so much if it went in on an angle, but cut it off totally and stalled the 
engine sometimes). Obviously the parts were known to fail, as 
the '79 &quot;head&quot; that I put back on was much simpler and didn't even have 
that part.

To wind up, with the '79 &quot;head&quot; it ran fine, didn't miss a beat, and the 
fact that the factory changed the pump to eliminate some parts indicates 
that it was a known problem, so if you're getting fuel starvation on the 
highway and all the usual suspects are coming up blank, try pulling 
the &quot;head&quot; off the fuel pump (if you have a dual carb type 4 engine, 
anyway), you may well find that the valve/diaphram has gone and you're 
sucking the cup into the hole to cut off your fuel flow when you need it.

FWIW
