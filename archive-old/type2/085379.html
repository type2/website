Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Cleaning

Mike Sims sends:

&gt; Hi all --
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just about ready to reassemble my engine.... I need to clean the
&gt; crankcase well, as it still has a bunch of gunk on it as well as shavings
&gt; from the machine shop.  Does anyone have a preferred product or method
&gt; they'd like to share?

I prefer to take it to the machine shop and let them run it through their
parts washer. But in your case I'd take it to another machine shop. What
machinist lets a part out with the shavings still on it?
