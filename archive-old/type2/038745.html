Subject: 1 engine from 3... for a '78 FI 2.0

I have three complete spare engines, each with its own story.  I would like 
to create one GOOD engine from them.  Any advice??  Share your advice with 
the list if you feel it is not a waste of bandwidth.

I am hoping to put this into a solid bodied, '78 2.0 Fuel Injected, stick 
Westy, sans air.

#1 engine is '78 complete, down to the ECU.  Came out of a standard, was 
rebuilt by John Connolley of ACES, near Dulles VA. All fuel injection there, 
but I have been taking it apart to see what ticks and have taken off the 
mufflers back to the elbows.  Hydraulic lifter and all.  Only concern is the 
PO said that when ACES rebuilt the engine, John C. replaced 'half' of the 
case.  What are the implications there??  Otherwise, except for the heat 
exchangers, muffler, and EGR filter, it should be runnable.

(I understand John Connolley is out in Utah now-a-days.  Sorry to see him 
go.  The 'kids' that have his shop near Dulles seem nice, and should be 
supported by local air cooled people.)

#2 engine is from a '77 AUTOMATIC and AIR.  It is a 'new' engine that the PO 
bought, so the case is clean, without numbers.  the engine died with lack of 
compression in #3 and #4 (I was able to get it to turnover before 'we' 
pulled it, and did a compression check myself.). I put good value in this 
engine, but the solid lifters, auto, and air causes me to question it.  I 
will eventually take this apart to see why it slowly died (I talked to the 
mechanic who loved this bus for over 4 years.  He told the PO that it was 
going, but the PO did not want to buy a second engine, so he ran it until it 
would not start.)

Again, I feel the case, crank, P&amp;C (perhaps only rings needed) and heads are 
solid (of course, needing a valve job, but probably NOT cracked or damaged.) 
  Heat Exchangers are NEW, and I already pulled the NEW EGR filter for my 
'78 a year ago.  Muffler is Midas, replaced on a regular basis by the PO, 
who was the original owner.

I only mention the ancillary items because obviously the PO spared no 
expense, until the expense became onerous.

#3 engine is probably a '77, manual, probably no air, but completely 
unknown.  Looks a bit worn, but was intended as a direct replacement for 
another '77 before I came into possession.  Was intended as a 'drop in', but 
obviously needs attention.  Maybe I will take it to a local High School, and 
let the shop manager take it down into little pieces, and give it back to me 
in zip lock baggies!!

So, do I reconstruct a replacement engine from the pieces and parts I have, 
or send my installed '78 out for a local rebuild?  I still have plenty of 
time, since my current/original engine has only 140,000 miles on it, and I 
have 23 oil filters in stockpile from a super sale.

Barry asks  Springfield VA  '78 Westy with '80 Vanagon rear view mirror.

Oh, yes, I just want to add this bit of non-technical info:  I have the 'L' 
shaped table arm stashed in the Westy's spare tire cabinet, right behind the 
driver's seat.  Fits very nicely.  I also have the smaller, white, Vanagon 
table (there are two sizes) stashed back there, too. Out of sight, out of 
the way, and I can easily get to them when I do any serious in-bus 
picnicking with the family/kids.

OK, one more thing.  I have a 9&quot; TV/VCR combo AC/DC which fits nicely in the 
large sink cabinet.  I pull it out on boring trips, and put a video in for 
the kids.  The video is usually one from the local library, since I can 
check a couple videos out for 3 weeks at a time, and they are classics which 
the kids have never seen (Metropolis??).  I also tape from the commercial TV 
if I expect that a long trip is in the making.
