Subject: Parts needed for 1970 Westy

Here's what I need for my 1970 pop-top Westy:


The biggest thing it needs is the complete insides if the ice box.  My ice
box is only an empty cabinet.  No liner, shelf, or insulation.  The door
liner is there though.

Next I need a 1971 intake manifold center section, carb, disty, and air
cleaner rubber tube (the part between the air cleaner and the carb).  The
bus has a holly/weber conversion at the moment, but I'd rather have a stock
setup.

Next thing is the little stool which sits next to the ice box, in the isle.

Also the child's cot.

I also need the aluminum strip which fits on the edge of the vinyl
flooring, along the sliding door opening.

The shelf over the bed has speaker holes in it, so I'd like to find one of
those.

A couple of my cabinet handles are broken.

I'm missing my emergency flasher knob.

Whatever moulding or trim fits around the edge of the opening in the roof
from the main cabin to the pop-top area.

One of the rubber hold-downs for the pop top.

Last is the bottom cushion for the rear-facing seat behing the driver.
Actually, I only need the covering, as my foam rubber is fine, but I'll buy
the whole cushion if necessary.

Please email me with info on what parts you have, their condition, and price.

Thanks in advance,

Kabayo
