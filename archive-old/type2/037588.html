Subject: 72 bus progress?
Content-Disposition: inline

Was finally able to turn my attention toward pulling the waterlogged 1700 from
my bus last night. Affixed the plates to it first, and the 10 - day temporary
inspection sticker. New York is very optimistic. It believes I can get this bus
driving in 10 days.
Well I proceeded to pull the motor, removed the 4 engine carrier bolts and the 6
rear bracket bolts, then shook it a bit. It wouldn't budge. So I took off the 4
rear support to rear bracket bolts just in case, and continued shaking, rocking
etc and still
it wouldn't budge. I decided to try giving the lower front studs a few love taps
and immediately noticed that the lower left engine carrier bolt saddle had a
gaping crevice - in the bell housing. yoinks. didn't expect to see that. Then I
notice the same on the right side. The transmission looks perfect otherwise. I
reach up and touch the bell housing, It seems crusty. I try to flake some of the
crud off it with my finger, but my finger goes right into the bell housing and I
get a mouthfull of dirt. The bell housing is actually the consistency of clay
and begins falling apart. I get my screw driver and work it around until both
bottom engine carrier bolts are totally exposed hanging in space. I can see all
the flywheel teeth. The inside of the bellhousing is filled with dirt which
piles up all around. Eventually I have the bell housing area gone and the only
thing holding the motor is the fact that the input shaft is frozen inside the
pilot bearing and the engine still won't budge.  I reach in with my needlenose
and actually unclip the TO bearing. Didn't help. Then it began raining hard and
I had to call off the operation. Looks like I'm going to have to try unbolting
the transmission now with the motor hanging on it and only one floor jack to
accomplish the removal.
