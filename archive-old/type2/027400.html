Quick question (I hope)
I wish to replace my headlight switch for my 71 westy. Bus depot has part 
number &quot;211 941 531E&quot; for 71 thru 79, and &quot;211 941 531A&quot; for like 68-70. 
Mine currently says &quot;211 941 531&quot; - NO LETTER. Will the &quot;E&quot; part work fine? 
How about the &quot;A&quot; one? Anybody know the term numbers on each? I sent an 
email to Bus Depot and haven't yet heard a reply. Also - when you order 
these switches - do they come with the escutcheon?(The little ring that 
holds it into the dash) - mine is missing and my rheostat shot switch is 
currently dangling from the dash by the wires....
wink
