well, whatever they are, there's one advertised for sale at the
website I mentioned last time (http://www.oden.se/~fh/T2.HTML).
The ad just says &quot;Ambulance fan (6 volt) $150.00,&quot;. The contact
is Ted Holman, ahshi_at_cdsnet_dot_net

Incidentally, Thom jogged my memory and I now recall this 
'54 ambulance being discussed on the list already. Sorry. Brain
wasn't fully activated at time of posting.

I took some pics of the splitty ambulance owned by a friend of
Damon's on the VW circuit shortly to appear on my page. Next
time I see it I must take some snaps of the incredible, weird &amp;
original interior!
