Subject: Re: [T2] oil cooler

&gt; Because I live in one of the highest elevations in Arizona, everywhere I go is
&gt; down hill. Getting most places is a breeze in either of my busses, but getting
&gt; back home is either a loooong gradual up hill or a short steep up hill, or
&gt; both. I am considering installing an auxiliary oil cooler before next summer
&gt; to help keep my engine happy when I'm climbing out of the deserts south of
&gt; here.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anyone out there who has added an oil cooler to a 2L engine who has
&gt; pictures of how they installed it?
&gt; What's the best way to tap into the oil gallery to get the oil to the cooler.
&gt; I can't seem to find any pictures of an adapter that takes the place of the
&gt; oil filter mount. Can I still use the good Mann or Mahle oil filters on these
&gt; remote filter mounts or am I stuck with using an exploding fram filter?

Tom,

You can use a sandwich plate adapter. It mounts between the oil filter
takeoff and the filter. It has a crude thermostat built in, I think they are
made by mocal but the package says empi. I have one at our shop I can have a
look at tomorrow for the part number, and yes, you can still use a good
filter, it will hang about 1&quot; lower.
