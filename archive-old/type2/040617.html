Subject: fuel tankage.. again.

I just finished the fuel tank derusting/repair think i have been thinking
about for a long time... most everything went good, I used the POR15 fuel
tank repair kit. The stuff works good, although next time I would just buy
the sealer and not the whole kit, as the price seems to be pretty high for
what you get. 


One thing to remember when removing the fuel tank on a 69 westy.... the
bulkhead between the engine and fuel tank has screws holding it that are
hiding right above the transmission.... they arent real obvious, and I am
sure that yours will have as much road grime on them as mine did....


On another note, what would cause the fuel gauge to quit working? It
worked when I took it out, but after I reinstalled the tank, no guff. I
made a point of making sure all the wires were reattached (the wire that
goes up by the voltage regulator and the ground wire attached to the
ceiling of the fuel tank compartment). All I did was remove it, wrap it in
a rag to keep the crap off of it, and put it on the shelf. Are there any
other wires I could check? I am not about to pull the engine and fuel tank
again.....


Thanks.
