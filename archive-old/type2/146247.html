Subject: Re: [T2] RE: '71 seats

I'll be darned.  I just took a look at the '71 in question and sure enough,
the hole in the back of the divider on the seat platform where the retractor
gizmo is mounted turns out to be something that the PO (or someone else since
he was pretty much clueless about such things) must have drilled before I
bought it in 1978.  He must have also put in seats with the head rests from a
'72 or later.  All these years I simply assumed that retractable belts and
head rests were the norm for this year and that my other '71 without them was
some sort of pathetic freak.  A check of the 1971 Station Wagon\Bus owner's
manual reveals only manual belt instructions and the photos of the seats in
the manual show no head rests at all.

Learn something new every day, even about a vehicle I've been driving (and
personally repairing) since the Carter Administration.  Thanks!

Nick

I think you had one '71 that someone put retractable belts in.  They were not
standard at all.

&gt; Based on what I found in a couple of '71s I've owned...The
&gt; later versions in that same year had...
&gt; automatic belts. My 71 with a VIN of 2212226198 had them while
&gt; another with a VIN of 2212119775 didn't
