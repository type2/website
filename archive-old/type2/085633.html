This is kind of off the subject of what you were discussing, but, It is
kind of on the subject...
What is the procedure involved in replacing the crank pully? I know the
whole pull the bolt and then use a puller to get it off, but as for
holding the engine still while removing the bolt and so on how do you do
so? And are there special things to watch for?

Subject: [T2] Rap on Distributors #2 (Jose's bus)


The second bus I looked at was also an early (68-70) bay, owned by a
member of the FMBC, named Jose. He had no initial complaint, he was just
generally worried.

The history as I got it was that the bus had been sitting for quite a
while and he had just pulled it out of the weeds and gotten it running.
Good job, Jose!!!!!

Checked his dwell, which was within limits (~46 as I remember) and
timing, which was also OK.  He had a stock pulley, which had two notches
and it lined up with the one I remember as being the 7.5 VOR notch, so
if he has hte right puley, his timing was fine.  I recommended, as I
usually do, that he get degree wheel pulley.

Note on pulleys: VW put so many different pulleys on engines, and so
much swapping has gone on, that at this point the cheap, sleezy looking
&quot;billet look&quot; degree wheel pulleys are really the only way to go :-(  I
hate them for appearances sake, they are truly non-stock, but I no
longer trust any pulley to report facts to me.  Bummer :-(

Lastly, his fan belt was as loose as a politicians tongue, which is not
a pretty sight on the podium and worse in the engine bay of a bus.  All
standing around agreed this was a &quot;bad thing&quot; and I am hoping he
replaced it soon (he had a new one in the bus)  I believe the reason it
was lookse was that  his pulley was &lt;euphemism&gt; quite rusty &lt;/euphemism&gt;
from sitting as lng as it had.  If it were mine, I'd have sanded the
heck out of the groove with some 220 grit sandpaper bfore installing the
new belt.
