Subject: [T2] Re: &quot;Ever seen one of these on fire?&quot;

Not sure if Jim's introduced us yet--we're newbies to this list.  In November 99
we bought a 74 Westie and one of the first things Jim did was change the fuel
line.  After he'd removed the old one, he said, &quot;This was all that was between
us and a fire,&quot; as he showed me the severely cracked hose.

And after this story, I'm so glad he took the time to make it safe for our
family.

&gt; I heard a sad story yesterday.  A friend's friend was driving her '70 bus to
&gt; drop off two foster kids at their new, permanent home.  All of their worldly
&gt; possessions, her dog and herself were in the bus pulling up a grade when she
&gt; felt a sudden loss of power, and saw smoke pouring out the back.  She pulled
&gt; over and got kids and dog out.  It didn't take long for the whole bus to
&gt; burn away.  She says, &quot;only the shell was left&quot;.  I didn't see it, but it
&gt; sounds like the dreaded cracked or broken fuel line problem.  She did not do
&gt; her  own work, maybe only looked in the engine compartment occasionally.  It
&gt; makes me think we should all put big stickers on our rear windows advising
&gt; &quot;HEY AIRCOOLEDS, CHECK YOUR FUEL LINES!&quot;.  Maybe we could start leaving
&gt; notes under the windshield wipers of Type 2s we admire in parking lots, too.
&gt; Sorry for this bummer posting. I know we've all heard it before but, keep
&gt; spreading the word.
