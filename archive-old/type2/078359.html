&gt; &gt; Would it be possible to convert an air-cooled VW engine to run on 100%
&gt; &gt; ethanol? If it is possible, what would be involved? Would it work on carbs
&gt; &gt; or fuel injection, or both maybe? Change valve sizes, material,
&gt; &gt; lift/duartion, CR?  Hotter spark plugs? Anything else come to mind? Let's
&gt; &gt; assume that the supply of ethanol isn't a problem and that we're talking
&gt; &gt; about a small fleet, not a single vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;The following racing series run alcohol: the Indy Racing League (fuel
&gt;injection, no turbos), CART (FI, turbo in 2001 changing to non-turbo in the
&gt;next few years), World of Outlaws (carbs), Alcohol Funny Cars and Dragsters
&gt;(not sure what they use for induction) and Monster Trucks (carbs with
&gt;superchargers, IIRC). Monster trucks run alcohol because most monster truck
&gt;races are held indoors, and alcohol exhaust is less likely to kill the
&gt;spectators than gasoline exhaust. I'd say you could run either carb or FI.
&gt;
&gt;One thing I know you have to worry about is the construction of your
&gt;induction system. Alcohol will dissolve parts of some carbs; get a copy of
&gt;Stock Car Racing magazine and you'll find carbs specially set up for alcohol
&gt;racing series. These won't dissolve. (These are also Holley 650cfm
&gt;Dominators.




&gt;  ..........Actually it is all the gaskets, diaphragms and seals in the 
&gt; carburetor and fuel pump for that matter that would have to be changed to 
&gt; a &quot;Butyl&quot; material for solvent resistance as will any fuel lines. Since 
&gt; Alcohol is a Solvent it will &quot;clean&quot; out any thing it comes in contact 
&gt; with so particles of dirt, rubber, carbon etc. will start traveling 
&gt; through out your fuel system if everything is not replaced or pre cleaned 
&gt; (this goes for metal fuel lines also). You will also have to put in 
&gt; 25percent or more larger fuel jets as I believe alcohol/methanol/ethanol 
&gt; is more oxygenated than gasoline, BUT the engine will run much 
&gt; cooler.   And yes it does absorb water so if you leave any amount 
&gt; contained for any time you will have to add a stabilizer/water 
&gt; absorber.  About the fire hazard, back when the Indy 500 was run by USA 
&gt; and all these cars carried up to 50-70 gallons of gas and hit a wall they 
&gt; turned into incendiary bombs and the safety crews did not carry Halon or 
&gt; Carbon Dioxide extinguishers just water which in turn spread the water. 
&gt; So in 1963 or there abouts they changed to methanol which is not as 
&gt; explosive and CAN be put out with water as it is not a petroleum product. 
&gt; I saw this in two CART races this year as his pit crew (and the one next 
&gt; to his) doused the driver (Christen Fittapaldi) with water. Now for other 
&gt; reasons you do not want to pour water on the car as water tends to do 
&gt; more harm after the fire is out. A good carbon dioxide (or foam) 
&gt; extinguisher will smother the fire by displacing all the oxygen while not 
&gt; destroying equipment.........  now I'm no expert...this is just my opinion.
