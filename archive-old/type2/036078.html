Subject: Removing type 4 engine, limited headroom

The recent talk about manhandling engines has reminded me of a question I
wanted to ask.  While I can see that it is much easier to remove an engine
if the bus is jacked up, has anyone ever done it without jacking?

The reason I ask is that I don't like to leave my bus in the street (things
go missing) and if I took the engine out in the street I probably wouldn't
be able to get the bus back into the garage.  But... there is not enough
headroom in the garage to jack up the bus (apart from the couple of inches
you get when you relieve the back end of all that weight).

So - remove everything above the level of the fan housing, and the rear
bumper, drag out on greased board or whatever - can it be done?  If no one
knows, I will have to get a tape measure out and guess.

Wish I could afford to build a new garage ...
