Subject: Re: [T2] Horn

Paul,

The horn should not ground to the frame!!!!  It is insulated internally
and there is not supposed to be any isolation between the mount point and
the frame.

Do this as a diagnostic:

Pull both wires off the horn,            No horn, check??
then turn the bus on;

Put each wire on the horn,               If the horn began sounding when
one at a time;                           either of the wires was attached,
                                         label that wire 12V+ and replace
                                         your horn, it's dead.

If neither wire alone causes the horn to blow, then put one wire back on
and connect a jumper to ground.  If the horn blows, then (a) that's the
12V+ wire and (b) your horn is fine.  If the horn will not blow, then
switch wires and try it with the other wire.  There is no insulation
between the horn and the body.  The electrical isolation of the horn is
internal to the horn and if it has broken down (rare), the horn is dead
and must be replaced.  Ask away with more questions if you need to!
