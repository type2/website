Subject: Re: Stopping at a rest stop

hi all,

I have had good luck stopping at rest stops to sleep... just trust your
instincts.

if it looks shady/not well lit etc... move on and find a wal mart.

On the other hand i have been to rest stops with 24 hour security, rv
parking with camping tables and shelters etc.

its really the luck of the draw.  If you find a good one remember where it
is, and next time you go that way you can plan to stay there again :)

When in groups of busses its even safer as you can watch each others backs
so to speak...

take care,

Steve
