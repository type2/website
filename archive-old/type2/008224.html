&gt; Just a thought:

&gt; Instead of brass bushings that wear out, has anyone tried drill jig
&gt; bushings that are made of hardened steel?  They come in an almost
infinite
&gt; range of o.d. and i.d. sizes and should last forever.

Since the throttle shafts are steel, they would gall if they were run
on steel bushings.  Not what you want to happen!

I really doubt that the wear rate of brass bushings would be a concern
to a normal VW driver.  Even the steel-on-aluminum stock arrangement
is good for over 100K miles in most cases.  Brass would outwear
aluminum easily.  If the bushings _did_ wear out, all you have to do
is replace them, say every 200K miles.
