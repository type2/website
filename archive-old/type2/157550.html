Subject: Blocking air intakes???

Long time reader with a 71 Dormobile stuck in Anchorage.  About 4 years back someone posted an original VW pic of air intake covers for use in cold weather.  The caption mentioned just remember to take them off when it warms up.  Now that I'm driving in -10 degree weather I can't find any information on covering up my intakes.  
   
  Do you guys think this will help with cabin heat, or kill the airflow?  I can't see overheating, but just curious about air flow.
   
  Thanks for your opinion
