 Thanks Mark for the leads.  I found the Haynes book today and have started on
the road to understanding my problem a little better.  Cleaned the carb, found
the numbers, identified the model and am now reading the chapters...I get the
feeling that rejetting a carb without a lot of expensive test equipment is a
tedious and chancy business...More later..I'm still looking for a FI
system..John Jensen in Annapolis
