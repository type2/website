Subject: Re: 71 Bus front emblem clips (70 bus measured!)

	I measured the holes in the front of our '70, the pins
in the emblem and the barrels of the clips the dealer
sold me, which are made to hold a different style of emblem
BUT could be drilled successfully to hold the pin style.

	Hole in front of bus sheetmetal: 7mm or 5/16&quot;
	Pin sticking off the back of the emblem: 3 or 4mm, 3/16&quot;
	Barrel of clip that goes into hole in sheetmetal: 6mm or 1/4&quot; (4/16&quot;)

	So if someone has 3/8&quot; holes in the front of their bus they need
a different clip than our '70. As I said yesterday, the dealer looked-up
the part number and got four little black plastic clips that had a tapered
cylinder that plugged into the round hole in the body and two
'c' shaped clips at right angles to that to hold the emblem. Maybe
this is for the later (raised turn-signal) body... The clip
looks like:
  _   _    _ _
 | ( ) |  (( ))  clip
 ==.=.==  =.=.=
   \_/     \_/  barrel

 Side      End

	I drilled a hole down through the axis of the barrel and poked
the pins from the emblem through that hole... Not a very good fit,
actually. 

	My old parts catalog shows something that looks much more like
a nail anchor and gives two part numbers: 
211 853 615 Gromet, VW Sign (to chassis 211 2300 000) and 
211 853 619 Retaining Plug - VW Sign (after chassis 212 2000 001)

	:)
