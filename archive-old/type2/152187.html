&gt; Richard,

&gt; I was thinking of the &quot;screws&quot; that hold the metal-upper dash to the front of
&gt; the bus.
&gt; The ones you're referencing are &quot;nuts/studs&quot; that hold the two pieces of the
&gt; dash together.
&gt; These are harder to access, and I don't know if Bob would need to, unless he
&gt; wanted to completely remove the upper portion of the dash.

no just need to get it out of the way, the minimum amount neccessary is
all that I desire, in fact I want to avoid messing anything up under the
dash (finally have it more or less straight)

thanks
Bob
