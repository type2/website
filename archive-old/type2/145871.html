Subject: Re: [T2] Ride height

My KYB's did raise the front a bit but my backside in the driver's seat left the van totally flat as measured with the vheicle sitting on the level garage floor with a carpenter's level on the bottom of the rocker panel pinch seam. We measured both sides. 

However another person in back or cargo will cause the rear to sag again so maybe the rear needs to be up just a bit to compensate. How do you drive your van - heavily loaded or not? I'm going to add a bit of twist to my torsion bars - like 1 notch to compensate for the Corvair drivetrain (75 pounds heavier) and 1 more notch to give it some extra suspension height since I tend to tow or carry cargo in the van. 

What kind of height does each notch yield? Anyone know?
