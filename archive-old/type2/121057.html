Subject: Re: [T2] what thermostat!?

Assuming you do actually have flaps (you can't see them, they're under 
all the tin), they'll just default to the hot position.  That meaning 
it'll just take longer for your engine to warm up in the cold weather. 
That would probably lead to a bit more wear on the engine in cold 
weather while the engine is warming up...

I'm sure others will chime in also...
