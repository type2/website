Subject: Major Bus sighting!

Open the latest issue of Smithsonian Magazine, September 1996, to 
the very center, Pages 60 and 61. 

There she is, the centerfold, a beeeutiful hardtop breadload camper, 
grren down below, white on top. Messy like mine, 
feded like mine, wires hanging down, just like mine.

Get thee to the library and check it out!

(Now we can start fighting about what year it is,
my vote says '71)
