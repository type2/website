Subject: Bus insurance

Can anyone tell me what insurance company they go through and if they have 
insurance for full replacement value? My insurance company will only insure 
for blue-book value which is close to nothing.  I have called every classic 
car insurance company I can find on the internet, (even RV insurance) and 
they all either have mileage restrictions or won't insure air-cooled 
vehicles or even campers.
Thanks,
Brian
