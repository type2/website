Subject: Re: [T2] VW CD's??


It should be ETKA. It is good for looking up part numbers. However, I have a
couple of negative comments about it.
1) it only lists the part # /part IF it was available when it was printed. If
the part was NLA, then it says 'no longer available'.
2) I wish it had a supercession list. It only lists the current part #, you
cannot do a trace on an old number and see if it is changed to a new number.



&gt; I will let you know, I just bought one. It has not come in yet. I may be
&gt; willing to burn a few copies if it turns out to be any good. For the price
&gt; of the CD and shipping of course.
