Subject: Re: [T2] auto trans wont shift

OK, after getting up to about 38 mph and pumping the gas, I have managed to 
get it to shift into 3rd.  I made a little slack between the gas pedal and 
kickdown and tightened the accel cable.  I'm going to try and get the 
linkage a little further to the back and see if that helps.  Maybe instead 
of having a spring to hold tension on the accel cable by the pedal, I should 
have a spring holding tension on the linkage pulling back?
