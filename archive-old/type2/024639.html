Subject: FS: tow dolly (tow you next Bus project)

Well I hope I don't get scolded but I bought this to haul a type2 and 
if I kept it I'd keep using it to do so, and I'd as soon sell it to someone 
here than anywhere else.

This is a '98 model (built Nov '97) Demco GT200SB. Demco is as you'd 
find out if you looked at these for a few months like I did the premier 
&quot;Cadillac&quot; of tow dollies and this is their top of the line heaviest duty 
commercial dolly. Their Kar Kaddy models for RV'ers go $1500-$3000 
depending on model and where you buy. Yes you can get a bottom 
of the line Master Tow for $750 new, yes you can get a cheapo even 
with 14&quot; wheels and surge brakes for $1600 or so. I looked at them all. 
This is the ONLY dolly rated at towing 6000 lb GVW (3500 GVW axle 
on the dolly, 6000 total for dolly and towed vehicle) extant as far as 
I can tell and is so HD it is unreal. Mine has torsion bar suspension and 
surge brakes. All hydraulics are NEW, new master cylinder/actuator 
assembly, new wheel cylinders, some of the other brake parts new. 
New D load 14&quot; radial trailer tires. New tie down straps, will have a 
new winch strap. Galvanized model, not cheapo painted but the not 
galvanized parts (the winch, the tie down winches, some handles) are 
surface rusted though they function just fine. We the public can not 
buy this dolly but I understand they are about $5-6000 new depending 
on equipment. A real 83&quot; between fenders and 8.5' width so you must 
be careful with it, as wide as a semi. It tows like a dream, I towed a 
6000 lb EVC with a 4200 lb EV and I swear it braked better with the 
load than the EV does without (had one emergency stop cause an 
idiot did a move in front of me.) The only thing available anywhere near 
this load capacity is the RoadMaster dolly (4400 lb total) and it is a 
$4000 dolly.

You can tow any bus, bug, vanagon, whatever on this thing. I've got 
$1250 in it not counting my labor on the brakes, that is what I need for 
it. That isn't up for offer, that is honestly every cent I have in it and I 
need to get what I paid out of it. If you make one good tow with the 
thing you have recouped the cost compared to commercial towing, I 
was looking at a $850 tow so I figured what the heck. Yes you can 
rent a dolly but no-one rents one with surge brakes and it would be 
foolish to tow any bay or vanagon without them, you can but the added 
safety is simply worth the peace of mind for the cost. I don't want to 
sell it but it will buy me an awning and some other things for the EVC 
so I will if I can. I looked at scores of dollies folks, and none was built 
like this thing is and I bought the best I could afford because I knew 
what I intended to do was stupid (towing the heavier EVC with a lighter 
underpowered, underbraked tow vehicle.) You can safely tow about 
anything up to a 3/4 ton truck on this thing. Of course RWD or 4WD 
need to be a stick or have axles disconnected but this thing is slick, 
loads fast, tows wonderfully. In some ways it is a better tow than a 
trailer, loads much faster, only big negative is that you can not back 
it up (well people who use them commercially say you can if you are 
good, but with two pivot points you better be darn good.) Anyway this 
makes the ultimate retrieval thing for us Bus hunters. Dollies do not 
require tags but technically the towed vehicle must have tags and be 
insured, obviously that doesn't always happen but that is how it is 
supposed to work. They do not have titles, so I don't have one but have 
the bill of sale from the guy I bought it from and will give a bill of sale 
from myself to the buyer.

For picture and info on this model go to:

and look at the GT200.

Dolly is in Clarksburg, WV. I will take actual pics of the dolly in 
question if anyone is interested or come have a look a the the beast.
