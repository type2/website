Subject: Fuel line hose &amp; Breather Hose

Greetings,

'79 2.0L FI

I have my engine and gas tank out and tomorrow I hope to replace all the 
fuel lines and all the short sections of breather hose. A vendor sent me 3m 
of fuel hose that has the braided cloth stuff on the outside not the smooth 
rubber fuel hose that I am used to. I am slightly wondering about the 
braidedness of the fuel hose.

Is this right? Is this the best type of fuel line?

Also, even though I have had the outstanding &quot;DIY Fuel Tank Restoration&quot; 
article by Richard Atwell printed out for at least a month I failed to 
notice that I need 2 ft. of 9mm breather hose. I doubt I will be able to 
find this at my FLAPS and really would like to get this job done over the 
holiday weekend.

Is 5/16 hose a close enough match to use on the breahter lines?  At least 
the ones behind the firewall.  To be a geek  5/16&quot; = .3125&quot;  and 9mm = 
.3543'.  Seems like it would strech the .0418&quot;.

Thanks,
Brandt
