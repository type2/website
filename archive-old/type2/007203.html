Subject: RE: [T2] RE: How to use engine stand from Bus Depot.

The reason just two holes are used is so you can remove 1/2 the crankcase
with the engine attached to the stand. Every VW engine stand I have seen has
just the two mounting points.

Sorry Bill for responding twice but I forgot to CC the list the first time
:)

&gt; Yes, The tranny is off. Just not sure what two holes to use. 
&gt; So far It's been
&gt; suggested to use the two hole on the #1 cyl. side. I just 
&gt; don't want to distort
&gt; the case or drop end up dropping the thing on the floor. 
&gt; Still not sure If I
&gt; trust the
&gt; stand yet. Seems like it should have three arms at least. 
&gt; Anyonelse have the
&gt; floor stand from Bus Depot?
