Subject: 9 FT lbs Vs 40!!! (im in trouble)

Hello all,

Been off the list for a few months now and unfortunately am returning to 
confirm what I believe to be the worst mistake ive made in some time.


The oil drain plug will *not* come out, and im guessing that needs a 
helacoil repair done to it, so ive gone to use the oil strainer as a 
means of replacing the oil for the time being.

I dont know where, but I thought this nut needed to be tightened to 40 
ft lbs, which of course couldnt be further from the truth, and after 
consulting the bently, now see that it should have been only 9!

it snapped off. the little nut now has part of the strainer bolt inside 
of it, and im guessing its never coming out.

so, I need to replace that nut and the bolt that sticks down for the 
strainer to attach to.

does this mean I need a rebuild?

this is an '81 aircooled Vanagon.

still in shock,
chris
81 vanagon (possibly on it's way to the yard)
