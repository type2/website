&gt;Hi all,
&gt;I live in Phoenix.  Sparky has 122,000 miles on
&gt;his engine and he doesnt burn oil or smoke either. I always use 5-30
&gt;or 10-30 multigrade detergent oil in his crankcase.

If you check your specs you will see that particularly in high heat, like 
Pheonix in summer, you should be using 20/50. Your bearings and cam and oil 
pump will thank you very much for following specs in this regard.

&gt;Maintenance and Fixes to make him A-1 shape:
&gt;
&gt;1.      I replaced his water pump a while back (1 year ago) and had a hose
&gt;replaced at that time.

See non-spec coolant used below. Spec coolant extends the life of the whole 
cooling system/engine.

&gt;4.      Brakes are good all around (rear replaced 3 months ago). The front
&gt;ones squeal a bit during stops, but I was told that was because the
&gt;pads were a cheap brand, but adequate to the task.

Squeaks are proof of non-spec assembly. Brakes in spec don't squeak, period.

&gt;5.      Ive never used phosphate coolant; Ive always used the Peak
&gt;environmentally safe brand.

If you assume what you are told is true and act on what is said, be sure 
the only voice you listen to comes from the factory given specs. Or part 
with more rather than less pennies per mile for a lifetime.

Don't mean to bash you personally, Tim. But you, like so many others, will 
keep more bucks in your pocket if you follow the owner's manual as to specs 
for lubricants and fluids. Those are the only specs you can assume come 
from the best knowledge of what your machine needs to provide a long and 
continuously failure free life. It's not cheap to do it this way, but it is 
a whole lot cheaper than spending the time/money to address unplanned 
always premature failures.
