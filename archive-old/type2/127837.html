With all due respect, I don't blame the person for
saying you can't have the plates.  If you drive on
their tags, then they become responsible if you crash,
hit &amp; run, wreck, or otherwise ditch the bus somewhere
along the way.  The tags would lead the heat back to
them and not you.  I have sold a lot of buses in the
past few years, and I would never let a stranger drive
away in vehicle registered to me. I believe in
trusting people, especially in the VW scene, but at
the same time I would not want to lose my a$$ in a
lawsuit because someone else had an accident in a
vehicle registered to me.
