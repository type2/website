Subject: one more time...shift mechanism housing...

--part1_112.1556c70b.2a81da8c_boundary

OK ...
One more time...my housing for my shifting mechanism on my 1980 vanagon ???
so far I had some good help from this post...but I'm still a little 
confused...even my local mechanic is pulling his hair out...finally got the 
van up and running...runs great...but? ...I don't have second gear...the 
housing for the shifting mechanism where the shifting linkage is 
located...just below the stick shift...it seems to be a little sloppy in the 
housing...and I'm not sure if on the inside if there are 1? or 2? brackets 
called buffers..I think that's what there called ???...anyway...does anyone 
out there have any idea if those buffers are kind of like guides for the 
linkage?...which in return will let me get into second gear???...also is 
there anyone out there that has a picture of what this housing box  looks 
like on the inside...maybe showing me how the buffers are installed...and if 
and how the linkage works inside?....
thanks to all in advance...
