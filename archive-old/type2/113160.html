Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Builder expereince

Like any vendor, there are those with good experiences and those with 
not so good experiences.  I'd suggest that you check the archives and 
draw your own conclusions... (Personally, based on a story on the 
Vanagon list a few years ago, I'd rather walk than do business w/ Fast 
German. There are more reputable vendors out there.  Want an '82 motor?  
Jake Raby and NW Connecting Rod come immetiately to mind.  AVP as well.)

&gt;Can anyone shed any light on their experience with engine builders Fast
&gt;German Auto (http://www.fastgermanauto_dot_com/) or JustVeeDubs, which seems
&gt;to have many alias on the web  (http://www.justveedubs_dot_com). Both have
&gt;web pages that seem to indicate they will deliver a quality engine with
&gt;new parts (lifters/cams/heads, ...).
