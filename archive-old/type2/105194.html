Subject: RE: [T2] fuel saver

All the unbiased testing that I have read indicates that there is no proven
increase in mileage or performance. This product and many others like it are
clip on magnets. If you wish to make your own determination of this concept
go to http://www.wondermagnet_dot_com/dev/main.shtml and create your own device.
You can cheaply make something that creates much more powerful magnetic
fields than the devices that are being sold. The website has links to magnet
projects. http://www.wondermagnet_dot_com/dev/demo.html. One of them is magnetic
water treatment. Magnetic fuel treatment is the same thing. These magnets
are great for all sorts of things. Some People use them to pull ferrous
metals out of their oil. 
I don't like to discredit ideas that seem a little out there. I think people
should gather as much info and see for themselves.

Of Course, people look at me like I'm insane when I tell them that I haven't
changed the synthetic oil in my 95 Jetta in 40,000 miles..... I admit I'm
baiting the group for a response.

  


.......Anyone have any experience with this company or product?

Supposed to ionize fuel and make it better but I don't believe it...

Peace,
