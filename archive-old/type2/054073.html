Hi

I reckon that I need to do a spot of welding to my 73 bus.  Just 
under the accellerator pedal the metal is giving way and I can see 
the road :-(

But I need to know what type of welder to get.  MIG ??? TIG ??? 
etc etc

I can see that the metal under the accellerator is quite thin and 
presume that you only need fairly thin stuff to tack underneath so I 
won't be needing that big a setup.  

I had been thinking of getting a welding kit anyway so any 
recommendations??

TIA
