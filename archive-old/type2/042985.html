If you're timing with a strobe timing light (engine running, not static) and 
you have the original vacuum/retard/centifigal distributor with everything 
connected, it's 5 degrees ATDC.  That's what the mark on the pulley is set 
at.  You can also make a 7.5 degree BTDC mark on the pulley and use that to 
do a static timing (test light with engine off).  You might want to do this 
if someone has modified the original configuration.  Most of the ones I have 
seen these days have been modified by plugging vacuum taps and changing the 
distributor.
