Subject: bus boat

somebody was asking about a boat that fit on top of your bus ... at least,
i think it was on this list. well, i kept some little snippets out of the
magazines about it:

from HOT VWs, waaaaaaaaaay back when:
&quot;Technically, we never did a full-bore feature on the so-called bus/boat,
but Jeff Walters did devote two of his &quot;Transporter Talk&quot; columns to the
subject. Check the November 1985 and the March 1987 issues for a closer
look. From what Walters could dig up, the boat was originally manufactured
by the Kenar-Line Fibreglass Reinforced Plastic Products Company
(K.L.F.R.P.P.C.) back in the late 50's or early 60's. Rumor is they went
of business due to the high cost of painting their full name on the
front of their building and on each boat? The units retailed for $395 and
were called the &quot;Vacation Waterfarer&quot; and very few were ever made. These
would only fit on top of an early bus (pre-'68) and could be lifted into
place with two people. Later in life, the boat was reproduced by a company
based in Kelso, Washington, called Creative Plastics, which Jeff reported
on back in March 1987 and again, few were ever launched. We haven't heard
much since then. Happy Hunting!&quot;

and from another issue (Want Ads):
&quot;for sale:
1963 Deluxe Sunroof Micro Bus with boat - extremely rare - original owner.
     Featured 3 times in HOT VWs. Top condition, all original not restored.
     Many extras - Blaupunkt 3 band radio w/short wave adapter, camping kit
     &amp; canopy. $3750. Jim Liptak, (509) 448-9504, W. 1526 Borden Rd.,
     Spokane, WA 99204&quot;

then in some other larger pictures, you can see the latches on the front
... or maybe they are just handles. and the little wheeled thingie that
fits under the rear end of the boat and rolls in the rain gutter of the
bus (for loading and unloading). nice looking bus. kinda odd, though ...
he's got the sunroof open under the boat (the boat is tilted up a bit). ??

and that's all i've got on it. :)
