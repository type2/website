Hoop and the rest of you bus crazies;
   I am not familiar with the origins of the Type2 list, but am forever grateful
for the mountains of information this group has given me. And, not in the least
by far, the people it has introduced me to. By this medium I have had the honor
and privilege of meeting folks I would not have otherwise met. Mike Gensler
popped up and helped me with an engine pull, Nikki Elko dropped by for a brief
visit, all too brief  I might add,and within hours needed what little help I
could offer after a despondent deer decided &quot;today is a good day to die&quot;, on
I-10 in West Texas. Mike offered a spare engine if it would help. Larry Collett
visited later as well as Seth Avant of Laredo, Tx. I was encouraged by Steven
Dolan when I had questions. John Hanftr... dangit, I can't get the spelling
straight, but he's in Michigan and knows who he is, sent me a stencil for a left
side battery tray which I didn't get around to pounding together, which was
eventually sent to me (with a &quot;Just Kampers&quot; sticker on it), by Ron Salmon, of
Bus Depot fame, in exchange for a parking space for a double cab for a few
months.
   The bottom line is...we're perverts, every last one of us. We do not buy in
to $30,000+ SUV's that can't hold half what a bus could, cannot give near the
pleasure of watching the road unroll before our eyes, do not speak to us when
they're ailing...they just die. We're not like that. You smile when you see
another air cooled VW, admit it. You feel it. You'll stop to help.
   This list has given me more of that feeling than I would have ever guessed.

   Don't screw it up.

&gt; Actually it is not at all clear who owns it, or if one person even does.
&gt; There are at least three separate people who could arguably be held to own
&gt; it IMO. There is nobody who claims veto power.
&gt;
&gt; The real list admins deserve a lot more consideration than me, certainly,
&gt; and have for a long time. So do the people who continually improve the
&gt; content on the web site.
&gt;
&gt; What's important is that it has never mattered who owns it--we've been able
&gt; so far to deal with this in an atmosphere of cooperation and respect, if not
&gt; affection, without anybody threatening to take his ball and go home. I'd
&gt; love it if that could continue.
