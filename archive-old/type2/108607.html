&gt; All the original housings are doing that. In my opinion all of the
&gt; reproduction units are horrible except for the Hella made units that Bus
&gt; Depot sells.

Thank you.

&gt; Does anyone know if it was UV that destroyed the original housings?

If it's not, it's something close enough to be indistinguishable from UV
damage.
