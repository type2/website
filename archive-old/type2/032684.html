Subject: Joshua Tree -- brief trip report

Friday: My friend Virginia followed me out in my Samurai (for accessing
the roads to the old mines). David Schwarze showed up late Friday night
and actually found our campsite, even though we got re-routed to
Cottonwood because Jumbo Rocks was full. I had called him -- yay, cell
phones! -- to tell him about the change o' plans and he was nice enough
to post it to The List before he left.

We were parked next to an '89 Synchro Westy from Montana. I met them at
6:00 a.m. Saturday and chatted briefly while they packed up. They were
very impressed with our twin high-roof busses parked together. Then I
went back to sleep. I don't exactly shine at that hour.

Saturday: We took the Samurai over to Jumbo Rocks to see who we could
scare up and we found Jack. We met some people in a Vanagon from The VW
Club and they recognized the names Nikki Elko and David Schwarze and
said we were &quot;famous&quot; (I *think* that's good &lt;grin&gt;). We also found some
bus people over there who had never heard of The Bus List (&lt;gasp&gt; they
have now!). 

We had seen a pop-top over by Belle Rocks so we stopped over there --
turned out to be a Swiss/German couple in a shipped-over Nissan Urvan!
They've been touring Canada and the States since July. We visited with
them for a while and took some pics. Nice people! 

Phil Ruggiero showed up (sans bus, unfortunately) to visit briefly. So
here's the list of List people I've met so far:

1. David Schwarze
2. Craig K. (Austin)
3. Mike Gensler &amp; Ginny (San Antonio)
4. Art Lynch &amp; Kathy (San Antonio)
5. David Christensen -- I hope I spelled that right (Phoenix)
6. Jack Stafford
7. Phil Ruggiero

Sunday: We kinda ran out of time, but David, Jack, and I got to explore
some back roads. We found one filled-in mine and lots of cool rocks.

Bummer I didn't get to meet more bus people! But it's always nice to see
David and I finally got to meet Jack, who I've heard so much about. And
let's not forget Phil's cameo appearance! (Hi, Phil!)

P.S. It'll be interesting to see what we got in the way of pics, thanks
to David and his ubiquitous digi-cam.
