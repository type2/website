If you are willing to spend $350 or so, you can get a wideband O2 system 
that will give you an accurate A/F reading.  The prices on these have 
recently dropped from the $1,000 range.  I don't have links handy but a 
google search should turn them up.

&gt;Congrats! Always a good feeling... I was asking the list about using an O2

&gt;rich, lean, or peak, but there's no way to set it to an exact CO% without a
&gt;gas analyzer.
