Subject: Case sealing methods

Now that I have split my old case and I've seen/remembered that I 
closed it without any gasket sealer at all (except for the camshaft end 
cap), and knowing that it didn't leak, I realize that I have more 
choices for sealing the new case than I want.

I like the idea (from Karl, most recently) of using the unwaxed floss 
and some sealant. I'm going to practice bedding some floss in a 
transparent coating of sealant using the old case, because I am dubious 
about my ability to lay the thing in flat and even, without twisting 
it. I'm using &quot;aviation sealent&quot; branded Napa/Permatex. It doesn't say 
3H, but it's either the same thing or virtually the same thing.

There are some minor dings and flaws in the sealing surface, but none 
that cross the surface completely. It's steering the floss around these 
that makes me most uncomfortable about using the floss method.

The fact that the case doesn't need any sealer leads me to suspect that 
the thinnest possible coating of sealer might be best.

Mark
