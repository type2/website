Subject: Re: [T2] Removing fuel tank

&gt;Just did this last week. I have a cotter key removing tool. Looks like a
&gt;screwdriver, but the last inch is bent 90° and is tapered. You work the
&gt;point under the hose then push and pull it around the perimeter to break
&gt;loose the bond. I have a pick tool of similar configuration that I use for
&gt;smaller hoses in the same manner.

Brute strength did the trick. And the filler hose looks pretty good, so
I'll keep that 'un for a while.

Tuesday I get the tank flushed out. Monday (tomorrow) is the impound
appeals hearing. Wish me luck.
