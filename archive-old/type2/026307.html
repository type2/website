Subject: Cooling fan removeal
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD110155009A_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

I've been following this flaps flap, and am wondering whether or not I
really need the cooling fan?
I could save weight, and lost pwer by removing it. Then with my gauges, I
could modify my driving 
speed according to how hot the engine was, and if it got too hot, I could
shut it down for a while, 
and let it cool? Am I missing something here? I mean we all know the cooling
fan was just added 
to increase the price of the car so VW could make higher profits.
