&gt;     Steve is shopping for a new breadloaf.  He finally finds
&gt;one for a great price, but it's missing a seal, so whenever it
&gt;rains he has to smear vaseline over the spot where the seal
&gt;should be.
&gt;
&gt;     Anyway, his girlfriend is having him over for dinner to meet
&gt;her parents.  He drives his new VW to her house, where she is
&gt;outside waiting for him.  &quot;No matter what happens at dinner
&gt;tonight, don't say a word.&quot;  She tells him, &quot;Our family had a
&gt;fight a while ago about doing dishes.  We haven't done any since,
&gt;but the first person to speak at dinner has to do them.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Steve sits down for dinner and it is just how she described it.
&gt;Dishes are piled up to the ceiling in the kitchen, and nobody is
&gt;saying a word.  So steve decides to have a little fun.  He grabs
&gt;his girlfriend, throws her on the table and has sex with her in
&gt;front of her parents.   His girlfriend is a little flustered, her
&gt;dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sits back
&gt;down, but no one says a word.
&gt;
&gt;     A few minutes later he grabs her mom, throws her on the
&gt;table and does a repeat performance.  Now his girlfriend is
&gt;furious, her dad is boiling, and her mother is a little
&gt;happier.  But still there is complete silence at the table.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it
&gt;starts to rain.  Steve remembers his  VW. He jumps up
&gt;and grabs his jar of vaseline.  Upon witnessing this, his
&gt;girlfriend's father backs away from the table and screams,
&gt;
&gt;&quot;OKAY, ENOUGH ALREADY, I'LL DO THE F****** DISHES!!&quot;
&gt;
