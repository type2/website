Also check your spacing so that all three gaps don't line up. I'd be tempted
to re-hone the barrels since you've pulled the pistons out. One last thought
occurs to me, did you clean the p&amp;c's completely, and I mean with soap.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;Could the rods being upside down explain the problem of no compression?
&gt;
&gt; Remove the top compression ring and see if it is installed correctly.
&gt; It is either marked TOP or it has a bevel on the inside circumference
&gt; which faces the top of the piston. Compression against this ring
&gt; forces the ring out sealing the cylinder. The second ring also has a TOP.
&gt; These must also be installed in the proper order, 1st ring, 2nd ring, etc.
