&gt; Do you still have the heat shield in place above the muffler? I last saw
&gt; one of those about 1984 here in the rust belt! I might reflect a bit of
&gt; heat back toward the pavement, though!

actually pieces of mine made it to about 1994 or so, but by then it mostly
was an asbestos containment site... finally left it on some road
somewhere???  have no idea where it fell off.   haven't seen one since.
