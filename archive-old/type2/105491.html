Subject: Power windows

OK, don't laugh. The window lifter mechanism on the driver's side of
my bus is broken. The local boneyards are scoured pretty clean, and
they want me to buy a whole door anyway for $75 and up.

I found some aftermarket power window conversion kits for &quot;classic&quot; cars
that are supposed to work with all flat-panel windows in the $130-$180
range for a pair. Has anyone on the list ever installed any of these?

If so, what brand/model did you use, and were there any gotchas in the
installation procedure? This makes more sense to me than spending $75+ for
something that may not even work.

Thanks.

--Stephen
