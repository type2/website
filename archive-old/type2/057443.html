Subject: Tranny support and original engine or not.

Hello All

I have a 72 westy that I'm pulling the engine out to do some repair
work, things like clutch, ect.  However, I have never pulled an engine
in anything past a 70.

My question is do I have to support the tranny.  From what I understand
there is a tranny support on the tranny just in front of the engine.
The Idiot book says to suppot the tranny.  If so what is the tranny
support for?  I plan to pull it out Wend. Evening and am hoping not to
have to deal with a tranny support.

Also is there any way I can tell if an engine it the original engine or
not.  Or if the engine has ever been pulled?  It looks untouched but
that would suprise me since it is a 72?

Again please respond directly to me.  I'm still not receiving type 2
list stuff.
