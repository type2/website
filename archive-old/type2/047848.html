&gt; The pump is of a high-volume design.  Will this cause problems since a
&gt; single relief case cannot limit the maximum oil pressure seen by the
&gt; bearings?

The valve in the 1500 is called the oil pressure relief valve.  It performs two
functions.  When the oil is cold and thick, it forces the plunger down and
exposes two ports, one to the main galley and one to the sump.  As the oil
warms and thins, the piston is forced, by the spring,  past the port to the
sump and oil flows through both the cooler and main galley.  In a hot engine,
the plunger rises above the main galley port and flows all of the oil through
the cooler and then to the cooler.

Oil, like water, is not very compressible.  A higher volume forced through the
same size passages should create a higher pressure.  This higher pressure will
hold the plunger open to the sump port and the main galley port for a longer
period of time and at higher oil temperature/lower viscosity.  Your oil will be
hotter before it flows through the oil cooler.  This should raise the oil
temperature, and operating temperature of your lubrication system, crank,
bearings, rods.  Gene Berg recommended using the stock 26 MM pump in a single
relief case.  (and a 30 MM pump in the dual relief case.)  Based upon his
explanation in his book of technical articles, I'd go with it.

In your position, I'd install a new stock 26 MM oil pump.
