Subject: Re: [T2] Progressive vacuum advance problem?

You'll probably get more qualified responses from the list, but here's
my take anyway. I, too, have a centermount Weber 32/36 with a ACN SVDA.
When I first got the dizzy, I was told that the diaphram would take a
little while to settle in. Its pretty stiff out of the box, I guess, so
it takes some time to get in its groove. I got mine in Spring (March
'03, I think) and it took a month or so before it really responded. I
figured the cold weather probably slowed its settle in period.
I've read that the vacuum signal from the weber is not terribly strong
and some folks ream out the vaccuum port a touch to increase the
signal. I didn't do this. I'm not convinced it was necessary, but then
I never got a vaccuum tester on there to prove it.
I wish you luck with the Weber. Now that I have a pre-heated air
solution for mine, it isn't too bad... until the weather gets below 45
degrees...

&gt; I've had my new SVDA for a week, and I don't seem to be

&gt; It doesn't seem to matter if I connect the hose or not,
&gt; although sucking on the distributor seemed to make all 
&gt; the right things happen.
&gt; 
&gt; What vacuum should I be seeing at the port on the 
&gt; carburettor? (center mount Progressive DFEV was the 
&gt; consensus ...:)
&gt; 
&gt; How bad a sign is it that mine is too low to measure?
&gt; (slight suction on a finger over the tube but no reading
&gt; on a gauge at any RPM. Decent vacuum elsewhere in the system, 
&gt; although a drawn out hiss after shutting off the engine has got 
&gt; me crawling up and down looking for a leak on the way to the brake
&gt; booster).
