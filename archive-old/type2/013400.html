Are you going to give us an idea of what kind of VW you have?
If its 79-83 Aircooled, you loosten the flex plate bolts through the
front engine casting hole provided. Remove the starter and other three
bolts around the outside of the tranny. Remove the front mount bolt and
linkage. It will nearly fall in your lap. Block the tranny up with a
stack of boards or use a floor jack. Remember you have to support the
engine or it will drop too. More blocks or bricks.
Be ready for a major oil spill from the torque converter if it comes off
while you're pulling the tranny, try to wire it to the main tranny by
some means. Also best to drain the tranny before removing it.

&gt; Hello list and all auto tranny lovers.  Can the transmission be 
&gt; pulled by
&gt; itself without motor?  Or is it easier to pull as a complete unit 
&gt; with
&gt; motor?  Thanks, Mark
