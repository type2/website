An idea I have been playing with is the engine compartment fire
extinguishers they sell in the marine catalogs. Looks like a regular fire
extinguisher with a sprinkler (as in fire control) head on it. They used to
be Halon and now they have some other gas in it. The sprinkler head has a
fusible link keeping it shut, I can't remember the melting point. Here's a
link of some with auto or both auto and manual discharge. I think they
started around $150 and up in the catalog I saw.
