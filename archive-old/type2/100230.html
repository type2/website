Subject: 2000cc Engine Mileage Poll !!How many miles on your rebuilt
  2000cc!!

I am looking into having my 2.0 79 westy engine rebuilt I was curious to see 
what everyone's mileage is like on there 2.0 rebuild and if they have had 
any problems in the given mileage that it has at its current state or since 
its been rebuilt I want this rebuild to be a soldier on trips. Also I would 
like to know who you had the engine rebuilt by and if you would recommend 
having me send my engine to them. Also what did the rebuild cost? I want to 
make sure I get it done right the first time. I can't afford a gene berg so 
don't even suggest it.


Casey
