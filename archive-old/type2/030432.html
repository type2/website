Subject: Vanagon gearing and cruising RPM's
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.9905191736560.26160-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

First, let me announce that the Vanagon is at my house, rested, restoed,
and ready to roll :-)  The Mark Stephens engine is in and performing
nicely (OK, there are a grand total of ~30 miles, hardly a long term test
:) and I just brought it home after a final tune up and ball joint
replacement at Paul's VW Repair here in northern VA (a fine shop, IMHO)
and am about to concentrate on getting another 20 miles on it and then 500
miles on it before leaving for the west coast next Friday (May 28, not
June 28 (as others have told me, it is impossible to squeeze a month
between June 28 and July 5 :-))

My question for the day is:  Are Vanagon's geared *way* lower, is this
engine *way* more powerful than I think, or am I dreaming???  The pads are
out of the (metal) lid and the rear cushion is still sitting in the
garage, so there may also be an exageration of the sound, but...  I tend
to shift &quot;by ear&quot; and my ear is telling me to shift about a 10-20 mph
lower in this new van than in my loaf.  That is, I'm in first to ~5,
second to 10, third to 35 and I ain't been in 4th yet, but I am betting
the engine will be at &quot;jumping out&quot; pitch at about 55-60.  The speedo dots
tell me to shift at about the same places I am used to, but the pitch of
the engine tells me we are geared for stump pulling, not highway cruising.
