Subject: Brake problems

I have a 1971 type 2, and am in the middle of re-doing the entire brake
system.  I have run into a problem, however.  I need to replace the line
from the servo to this &quot;junction&quot; type device (I suspect that it is a
pressure-regulating device).  This device is connected to the servo by a
brake line, and from there, brake line runs to the back of the bus.  This
is the problem: the coupling on the &quot;junction&quot; side is badly rounded,
thus removal of the junction is required.  Not too bad.  However,
although I got one side off, when I was removing the other stud (there
are two that bolt the device to the frame of the Bus), I heard a
sickening snap, and the bolt now just turns, without loosening.  Upon
inspection of the frame in this area, there is a factory (I would guess)
drilled hole on the opposite side of the bolt (inside the front
passanger-side wheel well).  I can insert a screw driver into this hole,
and feel the nut, or whatever it is, turn when I crank on the bolt.  What
is the best way to go about this?  Is there a special tool that I need? 
Is this a flat head or phillips type nut?  Any answers or suggestions
would be much appreciated.

Thank you,
Kyle
