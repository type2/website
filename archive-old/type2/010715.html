Greetings Volks
While it's not up there with world peace, another bus is up and running again.
A little history, I bought a 70 westy at lien sale with a blown motor and
running condition unknown, but hey, a westy for 300.00 bucks 325 if they
deliver it. Sold!
Tore the engine apart that night, classic cheap head rebuild, blew the
sparkplug out.
Quick rebuild later and were running. Check running gear, 3 14 and 1 15 in
wheels no wonder it wobbled so much.Can we say deferred maintenance?
New seals in tranny, new cv boots all around,cv's greased and reversed,new
wheel cyl and brakes on all 4 corners. What the heck, the wifes asleep, lets
paint those wheels and backing plates and bake them in the oven.	
Hmmm wiring by Bozo, well new fuse block fixes that. Lets see, now we got
lights, speedo and gas gauge, lets all go to the dmv!
We don't dare drive with expired plates in So Cal, they love to confiscate
your car if it's over 6months out, What!!! you want 280.00 to register, Lady I
only paid 300 &lt;sign&gt; gotta keep the golden state green$$. Lets see the latest
threads are favorite buses, easy, any bus I currently own although partial to
early 70's westies, why no buses in the midwest, could be a rust thing, this
bus has always been a socal bus and has no rust even though parked outside for
years. Oya and that FART on 009's, sorry guys, this ones got an 009 and no
flat spot at any throttle setting, 'course it's also got a 2 bbl holly bug
spray and duel port heads and is jetted correct. I'm shamed to admit that both
were bought new around ' 77 and have moved from car to car. And last but least
a drive away tent courtesy of Van Bondo &lt;sameless plug&gt; way overpriced &lt;LOL&gt;
but cool to look at. So if any of you cruise the Riverside area and get passed
by a scruffy white westy (hey the speedo says 70) it's probably me and my boy.
I'll have to wave 'cause the horn don't work yet.	
thanks for the info and grins, it keeps things on track
Chuck and Blake
'70 westy
now legal and running
