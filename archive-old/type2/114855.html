Scott


just because you drive a bus they think you are a smoker there bad for being
stereo typical..
not all bus owners are hippies and not all bus drivers are smokers or do
acid or shroomz or what not whatever hippy folk do ... which is still being
stereo typical..
i have know many true hippy folk throughout my life and have know some of
them to just be a hippy without the smoke or other things..
