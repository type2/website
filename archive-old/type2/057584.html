Subject: Help me split the case!!! (amended)

 I'm slowly tearing into the junk yard 1981 or 1982 2.0L engine that I
 may or may not end up rebuilding, and it's time to split the case.

 Tom Wilson's book &quot;How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine&quot;
 says &quot;there are 20 case parting-line fasteners on the Type 4.&quot;

 Here's my count of fasteners so far:
                                                   Cumulative
 ----------------Description---------------------- --Count--
 1 small bolt/nut at lower front of engine
   behind flywheel                                     1
 1 small bolt/nut even lower at front of engine
   outside of bellhousing area                         2
 4 studs/nuts along bottom of engine                   6
 1 long bolt in the middle of left side lifters        7
 1 stud/nut below oil cooler                           8
 2 studs/nuts surrounding oil pump                    10
 2 studs/nuts surrounding rear oil seal               12
 1 long bolt/nut at top rear, below breather          13
 2 small studs/nuts to left of breather               15
 5 bolts/nuts along top of engine                     20
 6 large bolts/nuts surrounding crank bearings        26

 so don't believe everything you read in books!

 At least Tom Wilson got *one* thing right; be sure you remove all
 the fasteners before attempting to split the case!  It's amazing how
 readily the case comes apart when all the fasteners are out!
