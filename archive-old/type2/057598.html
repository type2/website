were you looking to buy a type 1 or 4?

my local store here in fort lauderdale fl. buildes good motors. i have 2 of
them. i dont know if they ship that far but they might. they always have a
good selection wrapped up on the showroom floor.

if you call tell them limey marty sent you and ask for jason (the owners son).
they seem to be honest people.

no harm in calling.....marty :)
