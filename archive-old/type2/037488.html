Subject: Re: 050 Distributor And the Winner is...

OK Volks, this is how it played out.

Went down to the Kombi with 2 coils (1 New and 1 Used), a New Condenser, New
Regulator. 

First, I replaced the condenser. No Go.

Next, I tried an old used condenser. No Go (After forgetting to put the
rotor back in.)

Always had 11.5v to the coil and from center of coil.

Finally, I took an 009 with a Pertronix. Touched the key. It sputtered
immediately. Now, I'm no stranger to adjusting points and these were right
on when I adjusted them. I started the Distributor off at TDC and then
retarded about 5 degrees. (eyeball, as my timing light decided that it did
not want to work.)

Noticing that it was firing. I decided not to run it, as it had sat for a
year and an oil and filter change was over due.

Went to fire it after changing the oil. Nothing.

Pushed cables further into dist. and coil.

Started right up. Running rich on dual Weber DFV's? They look like single
barrel 40's.

Some slight sputtering. Richness screws backed out 2 1/2. Set them to 2,
still sputtered slightly and still smelled slightly rich on 1/2 tank of 1
year old gas and 1/2 tank of new gas. Leaned to 1 and 1/2 turns. Smell gone,
running smoother, but I still have no idea of timing. Upon downshifting and
slowing down, slight backfiring leading me to believe they are either:

A) to lean or...

B) Possible seal problem in intakes or exhaust.


Moral of the story, for the umpteenth time over the last few years...

Spend the $35 - $50 dollars on the Pertronix or equivalent instead of 3 - 4
hours of trouble shooting. I will NEVER use points and condenser again.
I will even go so far as to have a spare Pertronix or equiv. on board to
eliminate the hassle of road side trouble shooting in my Westy.

This is the second vehicle I have bought that the previous owner gave up on
due to some combination of Points/condenser failure.

Anyone want to buy a Kombi in good shape?

Thanks for the Multiple replies. I went down loaded for bear and came back
with my trophy. (Well almost. I'm not going to drive it until I get and
engine seal and timing set properly.

Lots of Karma to go around today...
