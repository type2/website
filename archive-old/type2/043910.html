Subject: [T2] caliper maintenance

  howdy tim,
  you said:
  'Brake lock up is caused most by unmaintained calipers, then by 
unmaintained hoses, then by unmaintained master cylinders'....
  is there  maintenance other than the 'flushing and renewel of fluid 
periodically' that you mention?? thanks.

best wishes
