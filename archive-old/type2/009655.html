I have a 71 transporter for sale...  i really don't want to sell her, but i
really don't have the time or the money to put in her like she needs...
&gt;from what i know the engine has over 30k on the rebuild, it does need the
whole round of brakes though she needs:

front pads
front rotors
back wheel cylindars
back spring kit

electrical is ok, i think there's a fuse blown for the turn signals... i had
the flashers on for awhile when i had the bus out front of my new place
unloading it with all my boxes and since then it the turn signals haven't
worked.. brake lights, and headlights work...  no bad cancer just some
surface rust around the front window and minor rust around the body. Panels
and floors are in good condition...    no middle seat, has a back seat but
no back to it...  has an original luggage rack on top...  she really needs a
good home... you can see an ok picture of her _at_

if i can grab the camera at work i'll get some more pictures...

i will entertain any offers for it...


i also have a 73 bug, engine rebuilt, it's a definite fixer upper...  i have
all new trim and floor panels for it... and it needs the tie rods put on,
which i also have...  i woud consider any offers for it...  and i'll try to
get pictures of that too...


Thanks,
Mike
