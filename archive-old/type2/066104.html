Subject: Anti-roll bars

I've just read Scott and Maggies write up of there 'ball joint' weekend during
which they mentioned fitting Sway Away uprated front and rear anti-roll bars
to their '71.

I've never seen these anti-roll bars advertised for sale on this side 
of the pond, so was wondering if anyone could tell me about cost and where to 
get them (including fixing kits etc). Preferably somewhere that takes VISA or 
Mastercard and has a fax number, to make purchase easy.

I'm not in a desparate hurry as my 5 year old rear brake shoes have just started
squeaking for attention.

Thanks in anticipation of your help.

Bob
