Happy 4th of July!!

It's been awhile since I've posted to the list, so I thought I'd touch base.

I've completed a ton of small projects on the buss with many to complete,
here's a short list:

New AFM
New rear Bumper
New Muffler
New Pop Top Canvas
New Shift Coupler
New Hubcaps
New Mud Flaps

Now for some questions:

1. On my old bumper I have over-riders.  I've seen pictures of busses with
them, but am unable to find a source for new ones.  The old ones attach with
a allen head screw/clamp arrangement that is rusted beyond removal.  Anybody
know where I can get some?

2.  The new AFM solved my hesitation problems (Yeah!!!), but now I'm
wondering if any adjustments need to be made to the FI systems. (Fuel
mixture?)  It seems to be running perfectly, but I just want to make sure.

3.  I've posted this before, but I really would like to replace the missing
refrigeration unit.  I have the icebox part, but the guts are missing from
the cabinet that holds the unit.  All the wiring is there.  Does anyone have
a working unit that they want to get rid of?

4.  The PO stripped the drain plug allen bolt hole.  I've got a new one, but
I can't get the old one out.  It is recessed into the case, no tool that I
have is able to grab it.  Any suggestions?

That's about it, I guess.  Have a great weekend!!

PS - The Bus Depot rocks!  Everything I've used on my has come from them.
The stuff comes quickly and the prices are super!  Thanks Ron!
