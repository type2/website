&gt; Hello,
&gt;     I am curretly working down my job list to get poor old Isolde through
&gt; her MOT.  I failed on play in the steering (among other things) so I got
&gt; yself a new pin kit, including the phosphor bronze bushes, and I am all
&gt; ready to fit it.  However, I have now tried lots of things and I can't get
&gt; the two old bushes out.  I've tried eat ad brute force (not that I am much
&gt; of a brute) and I still can't get it. If anyone knows the knack, I would be
&gt; most grateful if they could enlighten me.

I have done this job a couple of times.  They can be really hard to get
out.  Part of the problem seems to be that there is no room to swing a
really big hammer in there.  On one job, I wound up using the floor
jack, an appropriately sized socket and a 6&quot; extension. I started with
the socket on the lip of the bushing, put the floor jack under it (I
believe I took the round thing off, and used just the flat part under
it).  Then jack up so the weight of the bus presses it upward.  When it
almost disappears, you can add the extension or another socket or two
and keep pushing.  Both bushings should come out the top.  I used a
similar technique to install them easily, then reamed them out to size.

HTH . . . YMMV,  let me know if it works for you !
