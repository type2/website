As I pulled into the driveway Sun afternoon the engine stalled.  Attempted
to start it again, sound of cranking was r-r-r-R-r-r-r-R-  (one -R- being
noticeably faster than the other three; uh oh, that's a new sound...).  With
lotsa pumping of the gas it started but just barely ran at idle, still
pumping lotsa gas.  Eventually I was able to rev it up a bit, and it was
much louder &amp; rougher than before.  No pinging or tinkling to indicate a
busted something-or-another inside the cylinder.

I had reset the timing Friday.  It had been set around 10 deg BTDC (78 2L
engine with Weber carb) and seemed to run ok.  It idled noticeably worse
after setting to the book's recommendation (7.5 BTDC).  But it started and
ran ok Fri, Sat, Sun AM though I didn't drive it more than about 10 miles.

Working hypothesis:  problem has nothing to do with the changed timing;
Maureen has decided she wants to run on three cylinders.  Sound reasonable?

Can anyone take the diagnosis farther, based on given data?  The fact that
one -R- is faster than the other three has got to mean something...

I will check compression tomorrow nite (no free daylight time til then).

...disappointed cuz he was gonna drive her 5 hr to Lexington next week, then
again the following week...
