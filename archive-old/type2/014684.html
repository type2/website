Subject: RE: hitting windshields

Just a few comments about how tough glass can be. 
Our Camry took a full pop can in the windshield on and
expressway. We were passing a truck with a fridge in the back. The 
door swung open and a pop can flew out hitting the windshield
right in front of me. Made a hell of a bang. Didn't break the glass,
or even crack it. After a short pit stop to change my pants we were on our
way again;-)

My brother worked in a GM dealership in the late 60's. How did they remove
cracked windshields? One guy laid on his back on the front seat, and with
both feet
booted the windshield out. Two guys outside the car caught it so it didn't
scratch the hood.
Note I don't think they glued them in back then, More like the bus rubber
seal setup.

My dad once pulled out a piece of safety glass from and old TV. To show me
how tough it was, he whacked it several times in the middle with a hammer.
Good 
strong swings too. Then as he went to slide it back into the space it was
in, 
it slipped off the 2&quot;x4&quot;  it was sitting on , and dropped the 2&quot; on its edge

onto cement. It exploded into a zillion little cubes.
