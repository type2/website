Subject: Electromagnetic Pulses and Buses

First off, admins, if this is a Friday post, please flog me. I thought it might be on the edge, but not enough on the edge to contact you before posting.

There's this thing that can be used to disable computers in warfare, I'm told, called ELP, or Electro-Magnetic Pulse...or something like that. I'm thinking this would also disable about 98+% of the cars on the road. My question is, would this also disable a bus. If so, which parts are most vulnerable and is there a way to assure the viability of spares.

Scenario 1: Figure I'm running a 1600 DP vacuum-advance dizzy without an electronic ignitor.

Scenario 2: 2.0 liter fuel-injected with vacuum-advance dizzy or centrifugal.

Is ELP going to fry my battery? Will it fry a completely dry battery that's never had electrolyte added? How about switches? Or is it just going to fry memory...magnetic stuff?

Just so you all know, I sometimes write fiction, including bus-related fiction, so such questions are not abnormal and you don't need to wonder if I know something you don't know. Of course, if you know something, I wouldn't mind a p-mail. Truth is usually more bizarre than fiction. I once heard a true story about how this lady went into the desert and met these dudes from another world who called themselves &quot;the space brothers.&quot; True story...but that's for another list.

Thanks! Joe
