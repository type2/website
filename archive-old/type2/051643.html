Volks,

I am pretty much with John on this one.  I am torn in many such buying
decisions, tho, between price, availability, and service.  One of the
things I am gladdest of is that we don't have Harbor Freight stores here
in VA.  If we did, I would be broke all the time (like I am not already
:-) 

On major purchases I am willing to pay a premium to a local vendor,
especially if the item will require local servicing or supplies.  On
welders, if I bought one [1], I would check locally, check Harbor Freight,
check Sears, etc. When I had settled on a unit, I would start comparing
prices.  If the local vendor is within 10% [2]... no decision, go to the
local guy!  If he's not, print out the best price, take it to him and say,
&quot;OK, here is what I want, and here is the best price I can find.  Can you
get within 10% over it?&quot;  I agree that the local guy should get a
preferrence, but within a limit.

[1] I don't have one, I doubt I will ever buy one.  I am a mechanic.  Not
a pro, just an amateur, but a mechanic. I am *not* a body man.  Being a
body man is a whole 'nother schtick, requiring not only different tools,
but different skills and a different viewpoint. I don't know why, but I
know very few good mechanics who are good body guys and vice versa.

[2] Two things... First, this will obviously differ by product line and
may be 5%-15%.  Second, make sure it is a fair comparrison.  Compare price
+ shipping for the mail-order and price + tax for the local guy!
