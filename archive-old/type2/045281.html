Content-Disposition: inline

Does anyone know if it is possible to install curtains on a 1973 bus?? It is not a camper, but a 7 passenger. Also, does anyone know if there is such a thing as an extra seat that connects to the center bench seat, to make it an 8 passenger?? If anyone wants to sell one, please let me know!!
