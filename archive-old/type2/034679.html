No, it's VHF (88-108MHz), not UHF.  It would be obvious looking at the scale
if we had a better description.  Jen?  I have never heard of a car radio
with a UHF receiver (not counting 2 way communications or digital radio).

+AD4- I believe the three letters stand for UHF (ultra high 
+AD4- frequency), Long wave
+AD4- and Medium wave.

+AD4- UHF is in the range 300-3000 megahertz and is used mainly for 
+AD4- television and
+AD4- I think some kinds of communication, like emergency services.
