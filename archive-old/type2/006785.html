Used a Kooltron in my 79 Trans. for several years...Rules of use:
Alway's put cold thing's in.
Put in frozen blue blocks to help...
Don't run it for more than 4 hours with the engine off. 
Alway's run it when your  driving.
I used a bungie cord hooked onto the pass seat metal seat belt  stem, ran it 
around the Kooltron, and hooked the other end up to a hole in the frame 
behind the pass seat ( and point the fan towards the sliding door)...get that?
I hooked it up by running a 16g set of wires directly to the battery...the 
plug going into the kooltron was located just below the fan...just plugged it 
and unplugged it as needed and when i wasn't using it i tucked the cord under 
the carpet.
Put a 4amp fuse in line.
...It's very convenient and easy...kooltrons are a great table (or 
chair)...they are removable...and found with this setup I could keep stuff 
cool in there for 8-9 hours after  stopping the engine (at the beach)...pay 
attn to your battery though...
Aloha
