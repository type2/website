Subject: Engine Rebuild Update

Folks,

Just a quick update on my rebuilt engine.

I drove my bus with the rebuilt engine the 150 miles to Sydney last 
Friday. It's now in the care of my daughter for 6 weeks.

The day was cool but the oil temp got quite high. It hovered around 
125C on the long top gear pulls on the hills between here (Orange), 
Bathurst, Lithgow and Katoomba. Cooled down appropriately on the 
downhill runs. Kept between 80 and 100C in traffic in Sydney. 

Speeds on the highways were maintained at around 60mph. I didn't push 
it too hard up the hills when the oil temps climbed. 

I suspect the new rings caused the hottish running. Same thing 
happened after my last rebuild. It settled down after I got a few 
more hundred miles on the clock.

Goods news was that there were no oil leaks appearing after the run. 
Believe me I had a good look, especially after 2 years of a constantly 
leaky engine.

I did the first oil change at my daughter's in Sydney (at 250 miles, 
not 300). Took off the strainer, etc. No metal particles I could see 
on the strainer or in the oil, but I got a tiny sliver in my finger 
(geez they hurt 'til you get 'em out). Put the new gasket set on the 
sump plate but it didn't seat right. Put new oil in and it started to 
leak. Dropped the oil again, pulled of the plate, replaced the lot 
with silicon sealant 'tween the gaskets, strainer, sump and sump 
plate, etc (not necessarily in that order). No leaks apparent after a 
bit of a run around the suburbs.

So far so good. I'm starting to feel pleased with myself.
But I'll wait a few more thousand miles yet.
