Subject: Re: [T2] got it running sweet, Thanks

&gt; Reved it up to 2200 rpm and she showed me about 36 degree BTDC reading,
&gt; is this correct? Obviously vacuum advance is working. Dwell holding at
&gt; 49 to 50.

What year bus and engine and what type dizzy was this?
Also did it stop advancing at 36 or could you get more if you revved
higher?
