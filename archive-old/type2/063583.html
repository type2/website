Subject: re: color of curtains for the Westy

Jon, I have a bus they would fit very nicely in.  The Mothership would wear them very nicely.  I will gladly trade you a couple of tapes of Niel Diamond.

No, seriously I don't need them.  I just wanted to say that I am not sure I would go with black.  Unless of course you were thinking of using the bus as an oven, which I am sure it would cook a damn good casserole, and a large one I might add, but I am not sure black would be the color I would go with. 

Besides, with the moon and the stars pattern, someone that once did acid might be in the westy one nite,........have a blast from the past (flashback),..... jump out the side of the van, subsequently hurting themselves.  Now you would hate to be sued for wrongful injury because you had the wrong curtains for the individual wouldn't you.

Hey!    We do live in America, and OJ is free!  :  )

But then..... you would be satisfying the fashion palet of the Gothic population of today.  The kids that wear all black and have multi-colored hair, and several strategically placed piercing's.  

I had a van several years ago with dark blue curtains, and it held heat like a mutha.  I changed to light blue, and it made a noticable difference.  Plus it calmed my demeanor.  made me only yell at bad drivers. 

Yep, it was then that I quit dragging them from there vehicle's and pummeling them.  I like to think it was the blue curtains that made the difference.  It is a day I will long remember and hold dear.

I think a medium color that would serve both purposes,  functionality and head-turning good looks would be my choice.  : )

I am one that believes, &quot;It takes a village to raise a VW&quot;.  

But when it all comes down to it, each of us has our druthers.

Some of you may say, why all this rhetoric on curtain color, I say it may make the difference between life and death.

Just my ramblings on the matter, please don't take any of it more seriously than need be.  Just felt whimsical and bored.
