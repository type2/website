&gt; 
&gt; i need parts catalogs. bad. i know better to ask for a bus boys catalog,
&gt; but could someone send me numbers for other outfits.
&gt; 
&gt; also, what do you people think of RMMW? as in prices, dependability, etc?

You know I'm jumping on this one again, wasn't going to, but this
is offensive.  1.5 weeks before vacation this year I placed an order
of things I needed for the last minute engine swap in the '81 with
Bus Boys, particularly new mounts, intake manifold hoses, and an oil
temp gage.  Got Bill not Jim who I was going to give a good part of
my mind for still not having catalogs.  Bill assures me all in stock,
gives me the 10% list discount, and I pay for 3 day service to get the
stuff to me in time, I intended order on Friday, have by the next
Wednesday, install engine Thu, Fri, leave Sunday.  Well on that Wed,
no parts, I give em 1 more day, on Thursday get a message, call back
and Bill informs me gee, we were really back ordered on the intake
manifold hoses so I ran out bought em today and sent it, but oops
I couldn't catch the shipping guy in time to send it 2 day.  I had
made it implicitly clear when I needed the stuff and got screwed,
had to scavenge the manifold hoses from the '78 and have to pull the
engine again to do the damn mounts as they are terrible.  I am
really ticked but still price was good, I will note their engine mounts
are of questionable Indian manufacture, look OK but rough around the
edges.  Another $100 or so to them and still no catalog incidentally.
I really don't believe they have ever had one or have ever mailed
them out.  I'm ticked.  RMMW gets my nod 100%, emailed for catalog, had
it in like a week and a half.  Stuff in stock on time, gauranteed 100%
for life with liberal return policies.  Unfortunately no Vanagon parts
beyond what is readily interchangeable.  Just my still bitter thoughts.
Bus Boys should take note, as a further bit, as a true impulse shopper
male I would likely buy loads more if I had a catalog full of pretty
pictures in front of me, I know I do (Harbor Freight or Enco f.i.) could
likely drop $500 in one frenzy but without one, I only call for what I
need, probably better I don't have one yet.  I say to everyone call
RMMW get the book, really nice catalog packed full of stuff for all
your VW's.  To Bus Boys, shit all I'm asking for is a freakin
photocopy of the darn thing if it exists, come on already, go to
Kinkos.
