Subject: '69 VIN

HI Bus people,
   I'm tryin' to find the VIN on my '69 Westy.  Haven't looked extensively,
but I am about to get inspected, and they will not be able to find it
either.  SO where is it?  On another note, a friend and I have rescued
a '72 standard bus from oblivion.  He got it for $120!  It is a little
rusty, someone fried the starter wires, and the front is bumped, but
I feel that it is recoverable; at least it still has all good windows.
Our plan is to get a completely stripped 73 bus, cut the front end off
it, then cut and weld the appropriate areas onto the '72.  If anyone knows
a reason that this won't work speak now or forever hold you pea ce. ;)
The only real differences are the funky bumper on the '73 and the parking
lights which are above the headlights rather that below them.  It's
curious how they moved the parking lights down in 68? and back up in '73.
  Overall I think he made a killing,  but it's gonna be a looong project.
He has a notion to replace the wiring harness first, which could be tricky.
It gives me a good feeling to know that there's someone else willing
to put out the effort it takes to make one of these work.  I figure that
even if he doesn't get it right he's only out $120.  One could part it
out and get at least that much.  In this case the sum of the parts would
be worth more than the whole.  I've seen people show up at VW shows with
nothing more than a Beetle chopped to bits and made good money doing it. %(

      Drive On,  Chris  '69, '71 Westys and assorted bugs.
