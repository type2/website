&gt; unless the oil pressure light is on (in which case you must shut the engine

&gt; cooling the engine.

yes this is what I meant and do 

&gt; - do you keep your engine lid open to &quot;let heat escape&quot;? Don't. For better
&gt; cooling and to make work easier for the fan (hence the engine), you need
&gt; positive air pressure

different concept,
 your standing still no positive air presure,
and on a type 4 engine the fan is right at the rear door, 
 so opening the door allows air a shorter path to the fan,
and no ambient heat from the engine compartment itself

seems to work better when I have tested the cooling down time
