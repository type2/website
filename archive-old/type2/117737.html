Subject: Re: [T2] list stuff

James,

Definitely *not* the norm...but does sometimes happen...mostly when people 
are tired or read the message too fast.

Don't ask me how I know!(been there done that)...and ended up 
having to apologize to a zillion people.&lt;grin&gt;

Stick with it, this is one of *the* most helpfull knowledegeable
group of people that you will find in the vw community...we even had a 
&quot;famous&quot; psychology doctoral candidate use us for a study in online
communities!

Cheers, dave

&gt; I don't have a lot of space and time to browse but is this bashing and
