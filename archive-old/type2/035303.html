Subject: BBB4 &amp; Reliability

This might better be a Friday post, but it's on my mind.  Buses by the
Bridge was a ton of fun.  Thanks to everyone who put it on!  My question
though, does anyone do weekend driving tours?  My favorite part of the
Jerome show every year, is the caravan up there from Phoenix.  Seeing
everyone else on the road either be impressed by that many buses or annoyed
out of their head is great.  It's not a reliablity issue with us bus owners,
is it?  I don't mean to start hate mail towards me- but if that's what it is
going to be, do it directly to me so as not to waste everyone else's time.
Thanks again for BBB4 and the new friends we met!
