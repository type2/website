Subject: Two questions

Hi all...  What is the purpose of those two black rubber &quot;elbows&quot; from 
the balance tube to the twin carbs on the 1700 cc pancake motor ?

2&gt; One of those elbows has a &quot;branch&quot; that goes off in another direction. 
I could see no obvious connectioin to that one.  Is there and where would 
that branch attach to the motor ?

There you go...  I'm picking up a copy of the haynes book tonight, but 
I'm hoping the list migh provide the answers, before I read.!
