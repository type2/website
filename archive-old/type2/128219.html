Subject: Re: [T2] Check this out...

&gt; Michael it's not your wheel cylinders. Back in 1987 I went through this on a Moostang. Rebuilt everything, lost my brakes on the &quot;W&quot; road going off Signal Mountain, TN. ALMOST bit the back of a very expensive import.

I wouldnt say &quot;its _not_ the wheel cyl&quot; but &quot;it may not be the wheel cyl&quot;.
yes check that the drums are not over spec first.
and all of the other things chris says too.
still
it may just be a bad wheel cyl. ive had them just blow out before.
as far as the dual circuit.
he may have been running on only rears with no front brakes and not known
it. misadjust, bad MC. no fluid or air in the front circuits.

check everything on all 4 wheels.
