&gt; the rear brake adjusting stars:  Does anybody have a foolproof guideline
&gt; for determining which way to turn the right/left stars each time?

I can give it a go...

The direction the star turns to tighten is always clockwise, seen end-on
&gt;from the brakeshoe end of the adjuster screw.

(Need more details? If you can, visualize any given star in it's position on
the adjuster screw, with the screw in the mounting block. Got it? (If
necessary, pull a rear wheel and look at it in person.) Now imagine you can
look straight down the length of the adjuster screw toward the mounting
block, so you're looking at the flat side of the star wheel, from outside.
It doesn't matter which adjuster you're looking at - front or rear, or upper
or lower on an early bus front wheel for that matter.)
