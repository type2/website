Subject: Re: [T2] Need some straight goods.

It is natural to assume that you have square port heads. If your motor
number starts with CV you probably have the square port heads. However
I'll bet you're not the first owner so you need to talke a look at the
numbers on your heads, its right inside the valve covers on VW heads.

There are plenty of sources for heater boxes I just sold a good used pair
for $150.00
I've seen them on *-Bay and also by listmembers at very good prices.

 VW part
