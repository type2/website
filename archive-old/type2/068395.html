It was said:

&gt;&gt;As I was driving around earlier (116* today) I was wondering if any later
&gt;&gt;model &quot;loafs&quot;  ('72-'79) ever had Air Conditioners.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If they did, are they effective?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anyone ever tried to retrofit one?

Then Bren adds:

&gt;The PO of my '76 DC gave me an air conditioner along with a pile of other
&gt;things stuffed in the back bed. To be honest it looks a bit hacked up,
&gt;but that's just a quick observation. But, he *did* say that it was
&gt;original VW equipment.

&gt;It looks like it fits along the entire length of the underside of the
&gt;dash, and that you run the compressor straight off the alternator? (I
&gt;dunno, a second belt? Dave any ideas?). I'd be interested in hearing how
&gt;Dave does with his in Tejas. Course, I might be more interested in just
&gt;parting it out cause of the wonderful temperate climate here in the SF
&gt;Bay Area.

When I acquired my 79 Westy, originally from Houston(or Uston, if from that
part of Texas :-) it had an AC unit installed, mind you it did not work, but
it was there.  The blowers fit under the dash, one for each side, the condenser
is under the body, with a louvered grate covering it for protection, and the
compressor was mounted on the left rear of the engine, directly to the
fan housing.  It was powered by a pulley mounted between the fan/alternator
pulley, and the engine case. As a consequence, the piece of engine tin in the
rear left corner of the engine was cut, to fit the compressor in the middle.

To replace the belt, required removing the alternator belt, the fan, and then
sliding the belt in through the hole left, and adjusting the mounting bolts,
on the compressor. To remove the engine, required disconnecting the hoses,
loosing the freon, removing the compressor, and mounting bracket from the
fan housing, and then lowering the engine.  The entire unit was made my DPD.
Which I believe was a factory authorized supplier of AC parts and units for
VW.  I thought I read somewhere, that no AC units were installed at the
factory, but that the dealers installed them after receiving the vehicles,
with VW's authorization.


Cheers,

David
