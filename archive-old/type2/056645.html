re: converting from 14 to 15 inch wheels.

It would seem to me to be a good idea, seeing as how even the
&quot;correct&quot; 185R14 tires are about an inch smaller in diameter than the
original bias ply tires.  The larger rim, with appropriate tires,
would compensate for this and restore the engine cruising RPM to its
design range.

Don't get carried away with wide tires, though.  Keep the tread width
narrow to prevent damage to the steering box (the boxes are fragile
and danged expensive to replace!)

Are tires available in 185R15 that are rated 1400 pounds or better?
