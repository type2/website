&gt; Muir gave me the courage to actually work on my bus.  My ex-boyfriend used to
&gt; do all the work on the bus (we owned it together) but when we split, I got the
&gt; bus.  I was getting pressure everywhere to sell it because, being a women, and
&gt; I'd never do any work on it.  I almost did sell it.  If felt I didn't know
&gt; enough to keep it running.  My beloved bus!  Without Muir's book, who knows
&gt; where she would be now, I try not to think about it.

Truly. The Muir book was something I'd heard of, and that made me want
to get a VW -- I mean, here was this codex to demystify the car -- truly
a life changing experience.
