I think I may have missed much of the thread concerning the $99 Auto zone 
axles but I wanted to share that I bought two today for $79 each from Auto 
Zone locally. They have a lifetime warranty and the manager assures me that 
short of tearing the boots on a road hazard - that they are covered by the 
warranty. I told him about the last set of boots I put on my old axles self 
destructed in a year.

On a different topic - I'm having lots of fun try to to buy a set of tires 
locally for $80 a tire or so.

I hesitate to order via Tire Rack or others because I don't want to pay 
shipping and mounting and balancing. I'm leaning towards Michelins and have 
found several $80 tires but can't seem to get them locally. I am trying to 
get decent tires with the right load range so they'll be safe and last long 
enough.

Ah life in a small town...

Virtually every tire store (save a couple) have tried to sell me underrated 
tires - basically whatever was in stock. Several didn't even have 
salespeople who knew what the load rating meant (97, etc.)!

Trying to find the tires myself, and choose the right one myself 'cause it 
is obvious not many have folks that can offer good advice. I'll be dealing 
with the one or two that have.

(I'm trying to get supermarket prices through the tire stores with the 
intelligent sales folks - a hard combination to get. I don't think either 
place with match prices..)

That's all I had to post. Just wanted to share my good buy on axles and the 
frustration of trying to shop locally (closest big city is 80 miles so no 
Sears, Pep Boys, or NTB - we're only 30K people here). We have franchises 
but family owned ones.
