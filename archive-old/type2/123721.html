Subject: Keyless ignition :)

I have a bum ignition switch. While I wait for a new one, could someone
please help me with hotwiring. I see a Red, a red w/ black stripe and a
gray.
 
Also does anyone know what size the nut that holds the steering wheel on
is. Bentley says M18, but my spark plug socket is still to small. I need
to head to do the sotre on Monday and get one so I can stop parking on
hills.
 
Thanks all,
    Zach 1970 Westy
