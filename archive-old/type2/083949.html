Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon seats

It's on the side of the seat, I believe on the driver's side, towards
the middle of the track.  There is a little tab that you can lift up
with your finger.  You have to lift this tab while also lifting the main
lever to slide the seat forward.

&gt; No no no.  There's some tab or lever along the
&gt; track.  You use a screwdriver or something on it.
&gt;  Seems like it might have been in the rear of the
&gt; track.  I'm sorry I cannot be more specific
&gt; because its been awhile.
