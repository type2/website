Dear Dave &amp; Dasha,

Definitely get the bus as solid mechanically as you can before you go.
Consider collecting likely spare parts (maybe a spare carb, from what
you've said?) for likely use en route. Locate a good machinist before you
go, in case you need to order anything heavy while on the road.

Regarding where to go: On our VW honeymoon, we bought an annual pass to
the US National Parks (about $75 at the time, for both of us) and a copy
of a book with a title something like, &quot;Camping the U.S. for $5/ night and
less.&quot; We hit half a dozen National Parks in 7 western states, camped in
dozens of locations without paying a dime for camping. We also had some
serious engine trouble despite all my precautions, but we were prepared
(for the most part) to deal with it.

Good luck and congratulations,
Surfer Bob
1978 Westfalia, the surf/luv/honeymoon bus
