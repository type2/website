Yes, you can. The studs *can* come loose from the case, but my experience
is that because of the disimilar metals, they don't, unless the treads were
previously stressed. However, if case savers are used, as they are on the
'71 engine, you should use loctite on both sides of the stud, since the
case saver and the stud are made of essentially the same metals and there
is no interference fit.

Thanks! Joe
