AH hah!   soenoid problems, maybe sticking, maybe a broken fork that
pushes it out. might be spinning in reverse (highly unlikely) or maybe
just a bad starter. but it isn't the engine it is a starter problem.  and
it sounds like the &quot;Bendix&quot; is broken.   swap in another starter this
should get you going, but won't solve the stalling problem.

I suspect two different problems here

Good luck
Bob
