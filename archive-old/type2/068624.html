Subject: Re: anti-roll bar/stabaliser bar

&gt; the anti-rollbar/stabiliser bar on my 79 baywindow camper has sheered where
&gt; it connects to the lower torsion arm.

My 74 station wagon did the same thing.....I had a collar made up to fit
on each end of the break and had it welded up......still going strong...
