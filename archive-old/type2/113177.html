Subject: VW Compressor made by HATLAPA

they don't make compressors any more, but made VW powered compressors 
for a long time.
I know of another one on a trailer.
Nowadays they are no longer used because they are too noisy.

See pictures at &quot;The Samba&quot; under &quot;Other VW&quot;

http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+119871.jpg

Pictures also show my 77 crew cab (bought last december with an original 
12000 miles on it).

I have VW engines out of fire pumps, harvesters, generators and also 
know of one in a high pressure pump for filling gas botlles for diving.
I am always on the lookout.
