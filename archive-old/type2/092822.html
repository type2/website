Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door, and real cheap golf


&gt;Hey... It's getting to be time to have my sliding door fixed.  It's at the 
&gt;point where i have to hold it into the upper track and line up the front 
&gt;latch, then push the back latch closed to shut it.  It needs a lower track 
&gt;(and probably the metal that holds the track on) very badly. So, I'm not a 
&gt;welder.  Should i just take this to any body shop to have it done, or do 
&gt;you think i should look for a vw place?  I'm in Buffalo, NY.  Only place I 
&gt;could think of is John's Bug Shop, but I don't know if they do that kind 
&gt;of work...
&gt;What do you think?

Don't have to take it to a VW shop for rust repair. Strip the van out so 
that the entire track is exposed. Remove the carpet. Essentially have it 
stripped down and ready for work.

Take it to local body shops and tell them you need this panel replaced. 
What is their price? You will supply the repair panel. Gather estimates and 
go from their. They don't need to be VW specialists to do this repair - 
just good body shop folks.

Try to make it clear you aren't some hippy that wants a cheap hack job and 
that you aren't some dumb kid that will pay anything either. Hopefully you 
will get a normal estimate. In my experience, different prices for 
different customers - what the market will bear obviously.

Too many stereotypes of bus owner/drivers...


Ciao!
