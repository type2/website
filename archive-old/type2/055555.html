According to the Bentley I have, you only set the exhaust valves to .008
on 1974 1800 engines and/or when the exhaust valves are sodium filled.

Right under this note it says 1976 VWoA.  On the later Bentley's, what
does it say?

I've got my '77's valves all set at .006.  Should I reset the exhaust to
.008?
