Subject: [T2] 74 Dual carb vac line setup?

How do the vacuum lines go on a 74 dual carb setup?

Right now I've got:
1) From the body of the left carb to the lower (inner) inlet on the 
distributor
2) From the base of the right carb to the upper (outer) inlet on the 
distributor
3) From the base of the left carb to, oh I don't know, I guess it's the 
EGR check valve

Should I probably have both dizzy lines going to the left carb?
And then what, from the base of the right carb to the EGR(?) valve?

thanks
