Subject: New Tires - Awesome!

Greetings,

Just returned from a 500 mile camping trip to South Dakota in my '79 Westy.
I installed Continental CR21 185R14 tires 2 days before I left.  The
difference was amazing.  I had been running passenger car tires and knew
that there would be an improvement in handling, but I had no idea that it
would be this dramatic.  I drove in 25-30 miles crosswinds that use to push
me around like a sailboat, now they are hardly noticeable.  I could even
drive with 1 hand on the wheel.  They are noticably louder, but I can live
with that.  Tires Plus matched the TireRack's price of $45, plus shipping,
mounting, and valve stems, for a total of $300.  The best money I have ever
spent on my bus. I'm going on a 3 week trip from MN to WA/CA/AZ in July and
feel much safer knowing that I'm riding on these tires.

Just thought I'd pass along my thoughts to anyone considering getting the
&quot;correct&quot; tires for your bus.
