	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt; My son in Maryland with his '79 needs a starter. Any one out
&gt; there have one for under $80?


Close.  $89.95 for a U.S.-rebuilt starter with a lifetime warranty, plus a
$35 refundable core.  This assumes his bus is a stick; the starter for an
automatic is cheaper.
