Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Suddenly my single cab will start only occasionally.  The battery is good.
If I bypass the ignition switch and solenoid (terminal 30 to 50?) by the
screwdriver method the the starter whirrs happily. If I bypass the ignition
alone with screwdriver method the motor starts up instantly. Does that mean
I need a new ignition switch? Usually it will start several times with the
key after performing either of thise two maneuvers.
