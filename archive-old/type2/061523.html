     Folks, 
     
     I have to say that I was saddened to read Ken's news about Josh. 
     
     Living on the other side of the Pacific as I do, there was little 
     chance that I would ever meet Josh but I felt I knew him a bit from 
     his posts to the list. My impression was that he loved his desert 
     driving and that he would always pitch in with advice to listees if 
     he had something constructive to add.
     
     This list being the community that it is, the loss of a member 
     through death is felt far and wide.
     
     My commiserations to those who knew Josh personally.
     
     
     Ian
