Hello All,
    I did a search in the archives for &quot;adventure wagon conversion&quot; and =
turned up little of nothing.  That being the case, what kind of info can =
anyone give me on the adventure wagon conversion?  Is it a decent camper =
set-up?  What about that huge top stuck up there all the time? How is =
the handling?  Are these conversions less inexpensive to buy than a =
Westafalia conversion?  I have searched the web and come up empty.  Any =
info would be appreciated!  Thanks!
Brian Hayes
