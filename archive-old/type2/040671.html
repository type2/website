Volks,

I just made my first attempt at a valve adjustment. I only did cylinders 1 
and 2 cause I wanted to make sure I was doing things right just in case I 
screwed up the whole engine while I was at it. So I got them adjusted and 
fired it up, now it seems like there is some excess valve clatter. I assume 
this means they are too loose now and that I should go back and re check all 
of them again. Is this what I should be doing? Also should I wait until 
tommorow to allow time for them to cool down again before I do this?

TIA,
