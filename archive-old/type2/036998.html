Subject: Stopping at a rest stop

Dave wrote -

&quot;I'm planning on taking a trip in my 77 westy the last week in April.
I'm in Buffalo, NY and I'm going to Daytona Beach, FL.

    I'm trying to go as cheap as possible, and one of the guys going
with me suggested that we stop at a rest area along the thruway for the
night.  I'm worried about how safe it would be to park there all night.
Specifically, there are two in North Carolina, north of Charlotte on Rt.
77.  Anyone from around there know about those stops?  &quot;

If I'm not mistaken, isn't this the area where Michael Jordan's father was 
shot and killed in a robbery when he stopped at a rest stop to take a nap?  

Dave, if you need to stay overnight cheap, try a Wal-Mart parking lot, 
especially a 24-hour store.  They have security guards.  I heard there are 
even some Wal-Marts setting aside areas for RV's.  I'm sure that for gigantic 
motor homes, but if you buy some before you sack out, it shouldn't be a 
problem.

Better yet, isn't there someone on the list that can offer a driveway?
