Subject: Bus for sale in Vt.

Hello all,
   moving to California forces the sale of my bus.  I have put over 3k into 
this bus in the past year and a half.
It has a rebuilt engine done at Boston Engine exchange with less than 3k.  
Bus can be seen on  thesamba_dot_com.  Directional switch is new but is having 
issues after a year.  P- mail for details. It is a 1969 with 1971 engine.
$1500 takes it. :(
