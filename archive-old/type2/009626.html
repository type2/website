&gt;'79 2.0 liter California.
&gt;--The first issue is whether or not this is a &quot;california&quot; bus,  The GE
&gt;marking on the fan housing would make me think it is.  The points style
&gt;distrib would tell me it isn't?

Look at the left end of your gas tank panel. How many relays do you have?
1 = Cal.
2 = Fed.
You can also pull out your FI ECU and look at the # on it.
039 906 021D Cal Standard trans
039 906 021E Cal Auto trans
039 906 021B Fed Standard trans
039 906 021C Fed Auto trans
You can look at the # on the cover of the AFM
0280 200 022 Cal
0280 200 020 Fed

&gt;--On Road trip during stops it would sometimes have enough power to
&gt;restart and sometimes not.  THen later it would.
&gt;--Upon looking around I found that the D- wire (brown) from the regulator
&gt;to the alternator was melted.

Sounds like both of these are related to not enough ground for the starter. 
Look underneath at the front left side of the transaxle. You should see a 
braided heavy ground strap connecting from the body to the transaxle. Make 
sure it's there and connected and clean on the ends.
