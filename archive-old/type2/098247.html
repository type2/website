&gt; Wouldn't be

&gt; work on it

You didn't sell a car.  You allowed someone to
adopt your bus.  I hope you informed them of this
list and the various clubs also.  

I know that &quot;I'll rip up the check if you want&quot;
feeling well.  I've had it evertime a bus left
home.  Well, except that d*mn vanagon.

Peace and blessings,
