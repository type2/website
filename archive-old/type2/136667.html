Subject: rebuilt carbs/too lean problems

please help me try to figure this out:

72 bus, all-stock engine setup.

I sent my carbs to be rebuilt/rebushed. Got them back
shiny as new. Installed them, bus started and ran but
backfired on the wind-down and popcorn backfired on
idle.  (this is what it did before I had them rebuilt)
I took it to my ACVW mechanic (good guy, 25-year old
shop)
to be adjusted/synched.

He spent the better part of two days chasing problems
which he felt were keeping him from tuning them
properly:
1) replaced driver's side intake gasket vacuum leak)
2)replaced hose to brake booster (leak)
3)adjusted valves
4) still had carbs runnig too lean, found fuel pump
not operating right. Replaced fuel pump.

They still cannot get the carbs to richen up at
idle/low rpm. They seem to run alright at high rpm,
but at idle and on wind-down they backfire like mad.
He says they are too lean, and they can't seem to
richen them up.
He even tried replacing the 50 electromagnetic idle
jets with manual 55s.
Still too lean.

One other thing: he discovered the heads are type4
fuel injection. Could that be contributing?
Or, what might be the deal with these carbs, since I
just had them rebuilt?

Any help would be appreciated. I'm bleeding cash on
this.
I'd like to keep the stock set-up, I don't want this
to launch into a debate on dual versus progressive
(single) carbs, but jeez, a whole new engine (or bus)
might be cheaper by the time I'm done.

Help?
