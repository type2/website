Subject: engine running rough puzzle

The 1600 single port engine start running rough about a month
ago, but only rough when cold, usually. Over the last few days
it has gotten worse, mostly at speeds above 40 mph. Idles ok,
but hiccoughs a little.

So this morning I checked each of the spark plugs. All were ok,
but I replaced two of them anyway. I checked the valve clearances;
no problem there. Oil level is fine. So I replaced the condenser;
the points look good, and the dwell reading is about 45 degrees.
Still running rough. I then swapped the carburetor with one off 
my bug. Still running rough. So I checked each cylinder by pulling
a wire at a time off the distributor cap. The rpm goes down each
time I pull a wire, so it would seem that each cylinder is working
to some degree. I also cleaned the air cleaner and replaced the oil.

The valves, carburetor, condenser and plugs are ok. The fuel filter 
looks clean.

Things left to swap out: rotor, distributor cap, the whole distributor
(using an 009), anything else?

The shaft of the distributor is a little loose. Would that cause the
problem?

Have I missed something?
