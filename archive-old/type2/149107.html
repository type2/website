Subject: Re: [T2] Multiple Gauges - Dead Gauge?

Hi Todd,

I had a list-member send me a set of three gauges from a GTI... Oil  
Temp, oil pressure and voltmeter. The oil temp is in Celsius, the oil  
pressure is in Bar. (1 Bar = 14.4 PSI). I have the oil pressure and  
voltmeter installed under my radio along with a CHT gauge. Just last  
night I finally got the lights to work behind all three of them at  
the same time.

Now I'm thinking that for my next upgrade I'll put in a two-gauge  
under-dash pod for the oil temp and a tach.

Feedback... Gotta have feedback to know what's really going on back  
there.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt;      I was considering using the 3rd gauge pod in our dash to put  
&gt; something else in. I currently have a CHT in there that's not  
&gt; working (that was a whole other thread). Someone mentioned to me,  
&gt; and I forgot who... but.. someone mentioned that there was a 3- 
&gt; cluster gauge set, VOLT, OIL TEMP, and VACUUM or something that fit  
&gt; in that 3rd cluster perfectly. Unfortunately, I lost that e-mail...  
&gt; does anyone remember where I can get that or from what car it came.  
&gt; I think they said it came from the VW Fox?
