Subject: Re: Poptop Restoration

&gt; Questions:
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; How hard is it to do a restoration on the poptop? Replacing the seals
&gt; and canvas tent? This one needs both.
 
The poptop comes pretty clean if you power wash it, when I just got my
72 we towed it to a car wash on the way home and gave a good power wash
to the whole thing, looked much better. Bleach also seemed to do the
trick for the luggage rack, have not tried the poptop yet.  Be careful
taking the poptop off, its heavy and will scratch paint.  The seal you
need is about 60-70 $ and can be put on with a hammer and short 2x4. I
will be cleaning my top up this week end and let you know how it comes
out.

&gt; How hard is it going to be to find a complete Westy interior? If I
&gt; can't
&gt; find a Westy interior, I have been toying with the idea of
&gt; designing/building my own camping setup. Good idea, bad idea, anyone
&gt; have any tips?

By the looks of the interior pieces, the would not be hard to duplicate
or make your own, the only hard piece would be the mechanics for the
fold down seat. If you want demensions for pieces, ask me as all my
inside are out at the moment. I also did the reappoltering on the westy
interior and can give you the sizes for those pieces two. I also have
the official manual 74 edition for 68-74 busses if you have anymore
questions (the guy I bought the bus from, just gave me the book and he
still had more busses left)
 
I am leaving school and my computer and this list for a two weeks to go
home and work on the bus, but will be back with lots of questions and
info.
