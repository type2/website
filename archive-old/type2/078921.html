Subject: Re: [T2] battery terminal gunk

Corrosion!

Clean the cable terminals by disconnecting them and soaking them in a hot
solution of Bicarbonate of Soda.  Just take a cup, fill with boiling
water, put in a spoonful of soda, stir, and dip the cable end in the cup.

Clean the battery terminals by carefully wiping them with a paper towel
saturated with the same solution.  Keep it out of the cells!

Dry everything completely.

Coat the battery and cable terminals with petroleum jelly.  Do a good
complete job of this.  Exposed surfaces will corrode.

Reassemble.  Your corrosion problems should be over.  If you disassemble,
add a coat of petroleum jelly to the mating surfaces to preserve the seal.

I've done this for decades and it is the best way to keep corrosion at
bay.  The little &quot;anti corrosion rings&quot; they sell at the FLAPS are not all
that good.

&gt; Hi everyone. Simple question, I think. I seem to have excessive acid gunk
&gt; build up around my battery terminals and I can't seem to keep it from
&gt; returning after cleaning. Does anyone know what causes this?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Darin
