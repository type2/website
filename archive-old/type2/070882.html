&lt;&lt; 
 So, I'm wondering if I should take up welding, and where I would go to do
 so. How much of an investment will I need to make in equipment if I want to
 do this myself? &gt;&gt;

The answer is &quot;yes&quot;. This is exactly how I came to own a Century mig welder 
($399.00) and take on the restoration of my '76 Westy myself. Take it slow, 
research what you want to do ( books, Internet, etc., there is a wealth of 
info to be found on the Internet alone). Find a welding class at a local 
votech or community college ( this is what I did, cost $90.00 for 10 week 
class, well worth it). Dont take shortcuts ( filling rust holes with wire 
screen and bondo) or you'll end up being disappointed with the results. The 
ONLY way to get rid of rust is to cut it out and weld in new metal. You can 
cover it up, but trust me, it WILL come back. Products like POR 15 and 
Corroless work well to stop it until you do a proper repair, but IMHO are not 
permanent fixes. Good luck!   Jeff S.
