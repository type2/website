 Kinda. 911s have a guage showing oil pressure and temperature.

 I think the leftmost binnacle is 80mm (bus clock size) but the next
one in is bigger: 127mm (bus speedo size) and this is where those two
guages live. To fit them into the bus clock space the mounting hole
would have to be cut out to the same size as the speedo. If this 
worked it would look perfect, since the 911 guages are white on black
VDOs, just like the bus. This unit also has the idiot lights, BTW. 
 The senders are likely to be compatible, since they are all VDO.

 Worth a look, I'd say.

Cheers,
