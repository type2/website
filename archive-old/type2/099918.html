&lt;&lt; &gt; Dunno how long term oil magnet would change things (w/o filter).  Muir 
did

 &gt; houses?
 
 Problem with magnetic drain plugs is that they extend too far into the
 hole and interfere with the bottom of the strainer.  Second problem is
 that the area above the drain plug is a stagnent area, flow-wise.  All the
 action is above the strainer.
  &gt;&gt;

  Doesn't the pickup take oil from inside the strainer, making the oil flow 
through the screen, theory being chunks will stay on the outside of the 
screen and not get sucked up by the pump.    

FWIW, I ran a magnet plug and when I pulled it I usually found a tiny amount 
of fuzz on it.   

Ya, you don't want anything blocking the pickup, a magnet or anything.
Talking about drain plugs, it's a PITA to have a oil temp drain plug.  Anyone 
know where to get the oil pressure relief plug version?
