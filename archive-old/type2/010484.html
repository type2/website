when I checked the

&gt; We are using straight 30 wt oil as per our

&gt; hope this is not something really awful.  If anyone
&gt; has experience,
&gt; please clue me in.  Thanks, Beth D.


The mayonaise under your oil cap is water and oil from
condensation. If your engine does not reach operating
temperature the water vapor from the atmosphere will
not cook out. This could be from taking very short
trips and/or not having a properly operating
thermostat.
