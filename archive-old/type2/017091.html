Subject: Re: Putting in the Pop Top

Harmon and the List,

What to do with the stuff of living in a VW bus is a subject near and
dear to my dad's heart.  

It seems back in the mid 70's my dad, an old Vermonter from way back,
decided to take the family to Florida.  He had bought a used '70 'loaf
and loaded 'em up.  There was Dad, Mother, 2 teenagers, a 20 something
and her 2 year old daughter.

Dad had acquired the cabinates from a early westy and installed them
'best he could into the '70 van (The cabinate top and the roof line
didn't quite conform).   All the food and clothes for 2 weeks plus a
coleman stove and ice box were put in the cabinates.  He allowed each
person only a small &quot;diddy&quot; bag for their personal stuff.  

Dad built a jump seat for the space between the front seats.  Two adults
and 1 kid rode up front and the rest rode in back.  Seatbelts weren't a
major concern in Vt. back then and the kids just kinda bounced around as
they drove to Fla.

Sleeping was a real challange.  The back seat was folded flat into a bed
where Dad and Mother slept.  The 2 teenagers slept on the floor on an
air matress with their feet under the the overhang of the rear bed.  The
20 something slept in a homemade hammock streched across the front seats
and the 2 year old slept on another air matress on the floor by the
front passenger seat.  I think the entire trip cost $600.

When Dad bought his '74 Westy a year or so later he was heard to
exclaim, &quot;Now I got me some room!!!&quot;  Boy was I glad I wasn't on that
trip!
