Ok... Provided my flaps are in working order and my timing is in place,
how do I know if I've got my fuel mixture just right?  And what is an
acceptible margin of error?

I've set my mixture screw per Bentley, i.e. turned all the way in, then
out 2.5-3 turns, and then out more based on idle speed.  Is there anything
else?  Or any way to know (backfiring, etc) that the mixture is correct?
