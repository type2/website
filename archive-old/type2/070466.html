Subject: oil temp sender leak! HELP!

hey now,

i tried to fix the leak i've been having from my oil temp sender when i changed
the oil and oil filter today. i got the sender loose and kept loosening and
loosening it...it would come out. it is definitely loose and not in the grooves
and i could tighten it back. is it okay to pry it out with a screw driver?
seems like it would pop right out. i've got a major leak now, it was bigger
then a silver dollar 5 minutes after i pulled into work. i think i can fix it
by putting a new washer/seal on it if i can get it out. please help with some
advice!! if i can't fix it before tommorrow, is it okay to go on a weekend trip
if i constantly check the oil?
