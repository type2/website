This doesn't cover all the angles but it will help you some:

Decel valve mounts to firewall. Back left hose goes brake booster (left of
air distributor), Front left connected right, Yellow hose needs to go behind
s-boot to throttle (hard reach behind near firewall).  This is usually a
small hose.

Right hose in yellow circle goes to auxiliary air regulator.  Look for a
small plug at the bottom front right of the air distribution box under the
fuel lines/wiring harness/plug wires.

Steve Dolan once told me the green hose was 22mm.  It's the oil breather.
7/8&quot; is pretty close (is that even a hose size?).  It's connected right.  I
explained above where the red end of the hose goes.

No question for this image.

The plug on the air box connects to the top of the charcoal canister which
is behind the battery (78?) or attached to the firewall (77?).  It was a
clear/yellow translucent hose.  Another hose from the bottom of that
cannister goes into the right size of the engine shroud below spark plug #2.

This might help.

It depends on how your coil is oriented.  2 wires connect to Terminal 1.  1
goes to the condenser (or black box in my case) on the distributor. The
other goes to a wire running out of the wiring harness near the ECU
connector.

On terminal 15, one black wire goes to a pair of wires come from the back of
the fan hanging down.  The other goes to a fuse that go through the left
side of the firewall (grommet)

Weird hole in oil filler?  Did the previous owner charge a nickel a peek?
;-)

What is the part number on it?  If I had to guess I'd say it's a relay that
is mounted behind the fan hanging from the top of the engine compartment.
Normally a bunch of wires terminate in a quick connect plug that goes to
that relay.
