Subject: Re: [T2] type 1 and type 4 oil pumps

Recently I had to order a few parts from Berg to spend some 
credit I had there. I thought of buying another 30mm pump 
and cover for my next project. I grabbed a 4-rivet style T1 pump 
and a T4 pump that came out of a 914, 1700, W-code. Even 
without measuring I could tell that there was a major difference 
in the in- and outlet port sizes. I think I would have solved it by 
redrilling the in and outlet passages in the case (larger). I don't 
know if the later 2.0 hydraulic passages were any bigger, I'd 
greatly appreciate any info on this. Also, the drive thang seemed 
to go to deep into the camslot, although this could be corrected 
by pressing it deeper into the gear, or through the gear grind, 
and then press back into it, it seemed that the housing was quite
'deep' as well..  maybe the thing is the 3-rivet pump.. I'd love to
hear as ideally I'd like to run a Berg pump in that engine.

Thanks,

Brian
