umm...no, i was gonna blow through the line from fuel tank to fuel pump 
(disconnect end that attatches to the fuel pump)...sorry if i wasnt clear 
enough before..  :) im gonna save the pump to be the last thing i work on, 
it doesnt seem like theyre very failure-prone, and i think its more likely a 
fuel line blockage...i guess ill see when i get to it this afternoon...

&gt;don't blow &quot;Thru&quot; the pump but rather around it,  blowing thru the pump
&gt;while probably harmless, also is unlikely to have any effect.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; over to the bus with a spare tube and blow through the fuel line, 
&gt;hopefully
&gt; &gt; blowing any blockage back into the tank (i know, a temporary fix)...if 
&gt;that
&gt; &gt; doesnt restore fuel flow, then its time for open pump surgery :)
&gt;
&gt;unless fuel is actually getting to the pump, don't bother with the pump,
&gt;it can't pump what it doesn't get.
