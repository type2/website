Subject: dunlop sp lt 5

Anybody had experience with the dunlop SP LT 5?

I believe it comes in both C and D load ratings in the 185R14 size. The C
load rating is 6 ply, steel belted (only 2 ply sidewall, 4 ply tread),
individual tire weight of 1600+ lbs. 

Having a hell of a time finding the right tires, whatever those are.
