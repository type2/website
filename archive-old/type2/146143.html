Just  after that I started experiencing intermittent and elusive fuel
starvation  problems, the guys were booked out at the time, so I couldn't put
Tigger  back in to locate the problem, and it sorta cleared up by itself, so
I put  it down to getting a batch of bad fuel and having a smaller volume
fuel  filter than she'd had before the service.



Almost hate to admit to this, but when I bought my bus years ago, it had  sat 
a decade with no fuel in the tank.  I didn't want to pull  the engine and the 
tank at that time, so I flushed it with water  and agitated it with an air 
hose while partially full of water, then flushed  again.  I got a lot of scale 
out of it.
I let it dry for a few days, then put a new fuel pump (the reason that it  
sat for a decade) and line and filter, filled it up, and took off.  I  
occasionally have to change a fuel filter on the road, so I carry a pair of vise  grips 
to pinch off the fuel line and a few extra filters, plus a 2 foot piece of  
new line with a short metal line on it that I can slip into the line going to  
the tank, give it a puff of air, and put it back together.  I realize that  
this is a lazy man's way of fixing it, but, if the shoe fits...
 I have been driving it this way for quite a while, and I've never had  to 
change it in the rain.  Filter changes are getting less frequent,  too.  Someday 
when the engine comes out I will replace the tank, but for  now it works.
