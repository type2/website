Subject: Re: [T2] Eureka Springs

&gt;Question: my wife and I have hotel reservations for the Eureka Spring, Ark.
&gt;VW event, Aug24th. Are any of you going or do you know anything about it?
&gt;The financial timing is a little off. If there is alot for me to learn I'll
&gt;still go, but if it's not a really big deal I'll put the bucks into the Bus.
&gt;Anyone?

I should admit up front that I've only been to the Eureka show one time,
which was (I think) three years ago. It was a pretty good show (a few
interesting buses, lots of tarted up Beetles, almost no interesting parts,
overall a good attitude, didn't try to rape your wallet at the gate). It
was a surprisingly big show considering how far Eureka is from anywhere
else.

But: we go to Eureka Springs a lot when they aren't having VW shows,
because it is the coolest town between Santa Fe and Savannah. Take yourself
to the utterly limestone downtown district and walk every street. When
you've done all that, walk uphill from any given point and check out the
freaky/cool/funky neighborhoods. It is just an amazing place if you like
history/architecture/wierd but benevolent people.

Undocumented in the tourist brochures is this network of footpaths that
spiders everywhere you can't see, evidently when the Victorians were not
bathing they were walking around on the mountains. It is great fun to hike
these if you are in decent shape. Skip the Passion Play Jesus stuff and by
all means avoid the stupid Cave-O-Rama (somehow they manage to disguise
this fact in the photographs: every single solitary stalagmite/tite in that
cave has been broken and carted off. Not one single one survives).

If I were broke and needed a vacation Eureka is exactly where I would go,
it is beautiful and fabulous and completely unique. There are only a few
campgrounds and they all suck, but there are lots of hungry hoteliers just
out of town who will dicker. We expect to pay ~$45/night when we go and
there are so many rooms in that town that a VW show will probably not raise
the rent much.

Note that &quot;free breakfast&quot; or &quot;continental breakfast,&quot; a euphemism that has
already been wrung like a dishrag, means in Eureka a loaf of wheat bread
from the Winn-Dixie, a toaster, and a meager supply of Country Crock
individual serving packages if you get there early. Plan on supplementing.
