Subject: Re: [T2] really rough idle, shaking whole bus

I guess it is not allowed on the List to quote enough
so the reply can be read and make sense without also
reading the original post. How do you oldtimers get
around this? Do ya have to gothrough and delete all
the &gt; marks?

Jeremiah-
Exhaust are at ends. That's the intake. If it has that
much play, the pushrod will be loose - it has a large
area to play in. Look at the end of the rocker arm
that pushes on the valve. There is an adjuster
there.Should be, anyway. Compare that one with the
other ones.

What year / engine are we working on? 

Look in my 2nd album at the rocker arms. One has the
adjuster and one does not. Is this your situation?-BaH
