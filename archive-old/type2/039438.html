Hi Friends-

A great big thanks to all who have helped with the questions posed by my previous posts! But now, just about the time I think thinks are finally getting under control, something worse happens. 

In a previous post I mentioned how when I pulled the cable to #3 there was no noticeable change in RPM. At that time I believed the compression to be 130 plus or minus 5 on all cyl, because this is what was reported to me by the volkswagen mechanic who, about one month ago, replaced tranny and clutch. 

So after replacing all plug cables, cap, rotor, condenser, and points, I was still getting the same problem. So yesterday, I went out and bought a compression tester at sears, because I was a little suspicious of the mechanic's compression results. 

What I found: #1 150 lb
                       #2 threads completely stripped so no compression could be taken
                        #3 145 lb.
                        #4 120 lb.

When backing the #2 plug out, there was a bit or resistance, and after being unable to get the compression tester threaded, I checked with a flashlight and saw that that the threads were basically gone. So I am assuming that when the VW mechanic checked compression and replaced plugs something must have happened. The plug sockets were fine in Dec. and I haven't had em out since I had the work done.

I was real discouraged yesterday. So what should I do? I can probably take the engine out (although I have never done it), but what then? How much of a rebuild can be done by yourself (I am assuming from the results of the compression test, that I need a rebuild)? Any encouragement and/or advice would be greatly appreciated, since I am feeling a bit overwhelmed. What is all involved? This came at a bad time, financially, having just put a new tranny/clutch/CVs, so what can I expect to be able to do myself, and how much could this project cost? 

Also it appears that when they replaced the clutch, they neglected the cable. I have too much freeplay now (about 1.5 inches, and it grinds a bit when shifting into reverse) after driving the new clutch for about a month, and when I crawled under to tighten the wingnut, I found that it was basically tightened as far as it could go. Any advice here? New Cable? Is it typical to have it loosen up like that after having a new clutch installed?

Thanks for any help and encouragement

peace-
