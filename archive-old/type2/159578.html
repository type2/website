Hi Mark,

Your posts will be missed. But from the gist of them I am pretty sure  
another bus will find you eventually.

One question: Does the guy who got Peregrine for free know that it  
will cost him $5,000???


Happy trails,

To all on the type 2 list:

This list has been a major part of my life for almost ten years.  
Sometimes I posted far too often, and other times I just lurked. But  
always I shared with most of you the cantankerous pleasure of owning  
and maintaining a hunk of iron from another era.

In the end, though, it became a liability that I had to jettison.  
Yesterday, I gave Peregrine away and in a couple of days I will  
unsubscribe from the list for the foreseeable future (I won't say  
&quot;for good,&quot; because who knows?).

&lt;snip&gt;

But the finest thing that happens on this list, year in and year out  
-- the thing that happened to me and happened to many of you too --  
is that moment when, with lots of help from lots of people, someone  
gets their bus to start, and then to run, and finally to go out for a  
drive. Over and over again, that has happened.

And that's the best thing. Everything else is a footnote

Mark
