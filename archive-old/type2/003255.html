Subject: Intermittent power loss &amp; black smoke from tailpipe
Date: Thu, 22 Mar 2001 09:58:49 -0000
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello,

I would be gratefull of any help or suggestions.

I have a 79 bay with a type IV, 2litre, twin solex  (CJ) engine.

For the last couple of months I have intermittently been experiencing a
power loss accompanied by black smoke from the tail pipe.  (not great
billowing clouds but enough to be visible in the side mirror if you look
closely). This is gradually getting worse.

I thought this to be an ignition problem as initially it seemed to be worse
in wet weather and the power loss can disappear as soon as it started, there
will be a jolt and the van will run smoothly.  The problem mainly occurs
when the engine is under load, ie going up a hill in the morning.  The
problem either dosn't occur or is hard to spot on the motorway as the van
will cruise at 60mph for hours.

I ran a compression test and this was fine.  I checked the plugs and they
were very sooty.  I cleaned and gapped the plugs, I replaced the points and
condensor, I replaced the coil, I checked the timing etc. Still the problem
occured intermittently. I replaced the distributor (with a 009 I had handy)
and still I have the same problem.  I also checked the auto chokes, which
are fine. I also replaced the distributer cap and rotor arm.  The only part
of the ignition I havn't replaced is the plugs and HT wires but these are
new.  When I have the engine running in the pitch black there is no sign of
arcing in the engine compartment.

Is it likely to be some part of the ignition I have missed?

Is it more likey to be the carbs as the plugs were very sooty?

Could it be piston rings?

Maybee a sticking valve or something else in the cylinder head?

I would be gratefull for any advice as where to look next.
