Mike - I think that I saw something saying to do that in the archives (can't
connect - its down?- to quote) but let me tell you exactly what happened.
To install said radio I disconnected the battery and proceed with wiring -
connected constant power to the fuse  which is always powered and power to
the fuse which is powered only when ignition is on.Next connected the
speakers and reconnected the battery. Then went back and turn the ignition
on( did not start the engine)and check the radio ( about 3- 4 min total)
Everything worked fine so I tried to turn the engine on and go for a
spin.Nothing happened - engine was turning over but not starting. Tried
couple of times - no avil. - went to engine compartment and saw smoke coming
out  from the distributor.The wire between the contacts and condenser and
coil was melted.So I disconnected radio , change the points and condenser
and tried again.(radio still not hooked up)Same melt down .Next thing I
changed coil, points and condenser - engine starts.Hooked up the radio -
this time both wires to the same fuse (power all the time) works fine.So  in
fever of the meltdowns we posted little incomplete info - but you
understand - smoke and all of frustration... Now I'm still wondering - was
my wiring wrong or I played with the radio to long without engine running
and fried the coil.

I feel like I've missed something here.  Why would you want to disconnect
the neg wire from the coil to install a radio?  And how would installation
