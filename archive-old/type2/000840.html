I have a '78 w/ a DFEV progressive Weber. It has always run a little rich,
except my #1 always looks leaner than the rest (spark plug has an all white
tip while the other 3 are tan to dark brown)-compression's are the same
however. I'm at 6000 ft so I jetted down. It came w/ 140 secondary main and
a 135 primary main. Idle secondary was 50 and idle primary was 60- which
didn't make sense to me. What do you have?
As far as plugs go, I found the platinum Bosch fouled less than the copper
core Bosch.

&gt;  the new rings and I did the procedure to break in the
&gt;  rings &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; when you did the rings, did you leave a shim off of cylender 1?
&gt;
&gt; just a thought, although i think 140 is still ok...
