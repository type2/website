Subject: Re: Help- 74.5 Westy Purchase (sorta long)

&gt;I was told today by some lady in Massachusetts that the VW I am thinking 
&gt;of purchasing is a half-year model.  It is advertised as a 75, but it has 
&gt;the stove/fridge combo behind the passenger seat, and I am told that the 
&gt;model switched half-way through the year to having everything behind the 
&gt;driver seat.  Will this be a problem for me in getting parts, etc?  

No. What you are describing is the correct layout for the '75 model year.  
The change to everything behind the drivers seat occurred for the '76 model 
year, perhaps very late in '75 but by no means mid-year.

&gt;Here are the van specs:
&gt;-New Paint, original color, sort of a Tennis Ball type color
Check the rocker panels thoroughly with a magnet. This will identify rust 
or Bondo.  I personally prefer original paint, even if it's old, because it 
isn't hiding anything.

&gt;-Brand New Engine - 10 miles on it (BTW are there special &quot;breaking in&quot;
&gt;things I need to do?)
Why did the previous owner put a brand new engine in it and then 
immediately put it up for sale? Is there a warranty on the engine?  Who 
rebuilt it?  Are there receipts to verify that it was rebuilt?  How about 
the clutch?  Should have been checked/replaced while the engine was out. 
May want to check compression, etc. just to play it safe. 

&gt;-Interior, i.e. stove, sink, fridge, are taken apart and set on the floor
&gt;inside, need to be put back together, possibly some parts replaced, 

I have a decent supply of used Westy odds &amp; ends from a '75 and a '76.  May 
be able to help with some items once you figure out what you need.

&gt;-California Van, from San Diego, so virtually NO rust anywhere, a friend 
&gt;w/a 69 bus went with and checked it thoroughly, there were a couple spots 
&gt;where tiny spots were forming.
&gt;-cost $3200

&gt;I am new to the game, spent the summer in Detroit and tried to buy one
&gt; there, exorbant prices, much rust.  I am very excited about this van, 
&gt;possibly because of the fact that it is what I WANT, but if it is going to 
&gt;be a sinkhole, I would like some objective advice.  

Sounds like a fairly reasonable price, if it really has a rebuilt motor and 
virtually no rust.  The interior details you can do in time.  It beats rust 
repair or major engine work anyday.  You may not find too many rust-free 
buses in New England.  

Good luck!
