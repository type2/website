Subject: Re: [T2] Driver side sliding door??

&gt; Does anyone know if there is such thing as a driver's side sliding 
&gt; door?  I was just wondering, cause there seems to be an upper sliding 
&gt; track built into mine on the drivers side, where it is on the other 
&gt; side.  Was there like an option to have 2 sliding doors or one on the 
&gt; opposite side, and if there was, where would I be able to obtain one?

I think that's to accommodate right-hand drive (as in _dot_uk and .au).
