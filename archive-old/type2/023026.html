&gt;We've been talking a bit about tires, all of which makes me wonder what the
&gt;tallest tires are that will work in a bus?  Maybe that's the answer to my
&gt;rpm problem, although the price of a new set of tires probably exceeds the
&gt;cost of a tranny swap.  But at least it is another option.  So has anyone
&gt;run 215 75r 14s, or the like?  If so, did it do anything to calm the motor
&gt;down at highway speed?

I was thinking the same thing a few years ago, not only for the increased 
highway speed but also because of increased ground clearance.  I put the 
tire sizes into a spreadsheet and found that the 27x8.5x14 was just about 
the largest diameter tire that would fit on a 14 inch bus wheel (I seem to 
remember that a 225/75/14 would have a diameter of about 27.5&quot; if such a 
tire existed).  I went out and bought some GoodYear Wranglers in 27x8.5x14 
and have been running that size for about 40,000 miles now although I'm on 
my third brand/style in that size now - the Wranglers were bought used and 
the BFG's cracked and had to be replaced.  There are no clearance problems 
with these tires on a stock bus.  I did have a small problem with the left 
front tire hitting the A/C hose that comes through the fender when backing 
up at full lock, but that was fixed by clamping the hose down against the 
wheelwell more securely.

This size of tire will really fill the wheelwells nicely, maybe a little 
too nicely for some - they do look big.  I like the look and I think that 
the bus, like so many other cars out there, looks like it needs more tire 
underneath it.  It will drop your rpm on the freeway by a small amount - I 
haven't figured it recently but I'm guessing 200 rpm at 60mph.  You 
probably won't notice, especially since the relationship between your 
speedometer reading and engine RPM will not change no matter what size tire 
you run.  In other words, 60mph indicated will always be ~3500rpm in a '73 
bus regardless of tire size, but your actual road speed would go from, say 
58 to 61mph by switching from 185R14 to 27x8.5x14.
