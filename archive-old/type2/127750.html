Subject: Re: [T2] Compression Ratio and New Heads

&gt; I've been reading many different sources about Compression Ratio.  It seems 
&gt; that &quot;CC-ing&quot; the heads may or may not be required, shims may or may not be 
&gt; required, and gaskets may or may not be required.  My engine is a fairly 
&gt; recent (25,000 mile) rebuild, and I have all the specs from the builder.  I 
&gt; found no shims or spacers when I removed the heads, and found none when I 
&gt; moved the cylinders off the case for cleaning (I didn't remove them, just 
&gt; slid them up the piston).  The original CR was set at 8.0:1, the engine 
&gt; made great power, and I ran it on 89-octane gas.  It didn't get too hot 
&gt; (oil temp at 210F), but I also didntt have a CHT gauge.

the entire CR thing is different depending on where you ask the
question :) However I sure don't hear of any problems from people who
reassemble an engine back to stock CR's.

one more thing other than getting your CR where you want. having all
the cyls balance out is better. the more balanced it is as an assembly
the longer it should last.
