Subject: Re: [T2] Strangest error ever

Timo...and everyone else...

I had a spark plug connector fail on the way home one day...the inner
part that has the resistor in it just came apart.

Symptoms were that it would idle good, but when you needed power, it 
didn't run well.

It literally came apart when I pulled it off of the spark plug...*and*
it was almost brand new.

Go figure.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
snip

&gt; Took the dizzy out, cleaned, greased, reinstalled. Checked the coil (a new
&gt; one). Checked the sparks. Good sparks when idling, on #1 no spark when
&gt; revving higher! Checked the cable to spark plug #1. Seemed good. But while
&gt; checking the inner resistance of the spark plug &quot;plug&quot; (don't know how it's
&gt; called, it's the plastic thing on the end of the cables that the spark plug
&gt; plugs to. look at

&gt; I noticed that it differed to the others. Inner resistance was the same when
&gt; cold, but when it got warmer, resistance got up to infinity. Changed spark
&gt; plug &quot;plug&quot;, readjusted timing (which was way off!!!), engine runs like a
&gt; champ.
&gt; 
&gt; Lessons learned: These &quot;plugs&quot; actually can fail. It took me like 2 hours to
&gt; find out...
&gt; Apparently if it's #1 going bad, you cannot adjust the timing correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; Just wanted to share this with you,
&gt;
