&gt;&gt;       Does anyone have a URL for a site that lists all models of VW's,
&gt;&gt;year by year, and what engines they had? I'm particularly looking for
&gt;&gt;what years had diesel engines --- asked on the vw-diesel and vanagon
&gt;&gt;lists, but got no response.
&gt;
&gt;The Vanagon FTP Archive has extensive lists of this sort of stuff but the
&gt;only remaining source for it (gerry.vanagon_dot_com) seems to be permanently
&gt;offline. Joel Walker might have copies since he's the one who compiled most
&gt;of it.
&gt;
&gt;I've only heard of diesels c. 1982-83 but what do I know...

82-83 for the US.  The model/engine list can be found in the Library under
the Identification catagory, or go to it directly:
