Subject: Holidays in Britain

Hi Guys,
It's been a while since I've taken part in any threads
on this list.
I'm on holiday in Britain at the moment and I know
what you're going to say......&quot;It's the wrong time of
year!&quot;
Unfortunately you either spend Christmas and New Year
with your relatives or you go at the time when all the
VW shows are on.
Fortunately I was able to meet up with 2 fellow bus
afficianados, Glynn Seabridge and Howard Dickens, who
both live in Wales and they gave this sadly VW
deprived boy a day of innocent fun.
Glynn has owned buses for years, split screen campers
for choice, but his last one was written off last year
when a stupid driver lost it on a blind corner and
slammed into the bus.
What he does own, however, is a right hand drive Type
181 known as a Trekker rather than a Thing.
Not only did Glynn take Howard and I out in the
Trekker with the top down on a day that was very wet
to begin with, but he also let both of us drive it, a
HUGE priveledge considering the VERY tight insurance
rules here in Britain.
Howard also took us out for a run in his 1970 Devon
Camper and we all had a blast playing VW's :-)
I hope that anyone that goes a long way from home can
have the same marvellous welcome and generosity as
I've experienced here in Britain.
Here's some pics if you'd like a look.
