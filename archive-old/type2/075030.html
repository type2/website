Subject: Re: [T2] Advice neaded,

Andre,
    We've done extensive living/camping in our Westy, a 6wk trip being
the longest.  I have also bicycled across the country; a cyclist is the
&quot;urban deer&quot; of travel, being almost invisible to the common folk.  VW
busses are similar in that they blend well into parking lots, etc, and
are small enough so most don't know you are living in it if you are
surreptitious and don't have smoke coming out, or drain your sink onto
the curb.  Necessities are: 1. Porta Potti; there are ones small enough
(Sears Pakapotti) to fit between the front seats.  This is great for
overnights where rest rooms are not immediately available. 2. An ice
cooler or your Westy fridge; we kept a small rubbermaid wastbasket in it
to hold ice gleaned from dispensers at Holiday Inn type places.
3. We made opaque curtains for our Westy; good for bright rest areas and
blocking prying eyes in parking lots.  We have velcro tabs at the edges;
at night you wouldn't know someone was in the van. 4. Make a curtain
behind the front seat backs that extends to the floor; I ran a string
between the poptop pole mounts and made hanger loops in the curtain to
run across the string.  Above these shape the curtain to fit the roof
curve and add velcro tabs to the vinyl edging there.  5. If you don't
have a built in stove, a single burner Coleman fits in the cavity to the
left of the seatbed; it's the kind that fits on top of the squat propane
cylinder.  You can cook on the floor with one of these, since it's high
enough to watch a pot while sitting. 6. For waterless washing, those
tubs of baby wipes are great.  Don't forget GoJo for greasy hands. 
   As for places to stay, WalMart allows overnighting in their lots.  VW
dealerships are a good &quot;hidden&quot; place.  Tell 'em your points crapped out
and you are waiting for parts to open..... I stayed in my 71 Westy for a
whole semester in Graduate School while on public streets, and that was
in a Syracuse Winter!  This was in frodnt of homes mostly students were
renting rooms in.
