Subject: [T2] Which oil in a type IV?

Howdy listies,

Having survived a brush with engine death due to an oil related problem 
I'm trying to avoid future problems of this nature. One question is Which 
oil to use. Someone on the list reccomended 20w50 but another says just 
say no to dino juice.  ??   The latter mentioned full synthetic oil but 
I've heard not to use synthetic oil unless you do it from very early on in 
the engines life.  ONE MORE QUESTION my oil cooler is hooked up to nothing 
there is a port for a hose there where does it connect to??
