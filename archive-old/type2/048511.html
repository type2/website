Your oil weight should be based on what your engine needs, not on what it takes
to heat the bus in cold weather.  You don't want to deprive your engine of the
lubrication it needs just to heat the passenger compartment.  I've always used
30 weight.  I guess if I lived in an extremely cold climate I would use
something lighter as the owner manual recommends.

&gt; my 71 has an intact heating system with new heater boxes and i estimate it
&gt; will heat the interior of the bus about 30 degress warmer than the outside
&gt; ambient air temps....so, if it is 0 degrees F outside it will be 30 F
&gt; inside...i am going to a thinner oil tommorrow to try and get the inside
&gt; temp to a cozy 32....i live in the ozarks, where it gets about 0 for the
&gt; low....i recommend you collect sweaters, wool socks, muckluks, etc....still
&gt; wouldn't drive anything else, though..i cringe at the thought of driving a
&gt; &quot;modern minivan&quot;.....
