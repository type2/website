Subject: Re: shift rod coupling

&gt;
&gt; On my '71 Westy, I have the engine and transmission out and I've just
&gt; replaced the three shift rod bushings. I temporarily mounted my rebuilt
&gt; transmission and joined it to the shift rod via the flexible coupling.  I
&gt; was able to move the gear shift lever through the gears once, before the
&gt; trans locked up.  I'm trying to understand what happened.


This is not good. What gear is it stuck in?

I jammed mine once by not having the retainer screw on the coupler
cage inside the divot on the rod. It turned the adjuster 'hockey stick'
inside the nosecone too far and it got hung up. I just wiggled it
furiously but not forcefully and it popped out again.

&gt;
&gt; My question is:  Is this looseness normal?   If not, could someone have a
&gt; go at describing how tight the assembly should be? Should I be able to
&gt; easily wiggle all those parts. And I mean easily.


No, that much looseness is not normal. In fact, no looseness is normal.
Now, even new couplers may have a little bit of looseness at the corners
due to the rubber shrinking, especially NOS parts that have been on a shelf
for years. Urethane is usually so tight that it has to be tapped in there.

Are you shure that you did not mix up a set of couplers for different 
applications? Did the cage get deformed or something? If you have been
leaning on the shifter, like to get it into first gear at 3 mph, it may be 
stretched. Take it out and hammer the flats of the cage in 1/16 of an inch
each
to make it tight again.

Or, if you have time, a new cage and rubber set is only a couple of bucks,
like $10 or $12 if I remember.

Good luck. When I did mine, it made all of the difference in the world.
Second hint: If you kept the old plastic 'shuttle cocks' that support the long
shift rod, cut the little nub out of the inside of each and place them
on the rod again so you have the 2 or 3 extra ones on there. It will
help to center the rod, give it extra support and firm up the shifting
a little. Another hint it to make sure that the pin on the front of the 
'peace pipe' front shift rod section fits inside the plastic bushing very 
tightly and that the bushing fits in the frame member hole very tightly.
29 years had made it necesary for me to wrap the bushing with fiber tape
and the pin with an alum shim (coke can) to get it nice and tight. 1 mm of
slop here equals 1 inch of slop at the shifter or tranny.
