Yeah, I'd agree with Dave. I wouldn't buy it unless I was prepared to pull
the engine and/or discover the cause of the knock and fix it. How frequent
is the knock? is it with every revolution of the engine or every other
revolution? a timing light will help you determine this.

If it's with every revolution, it's in the lower end (according to the Tom
Wilson book I'm reading). Good luck! Joe
