With the weather as gorgeous as it is here in eastern PA, Volks start thinking 
of road trips and campouts.  So here's what's coming up:

* April 8, 9:30-12 - Monthly breakfast at the Pennsburg Diner.  We might have a 
few more folks that day because of the letter I sent out...we'll see.

* May 13, Lancaster, PA Autohaus - Bug and Buggy Show.  This coincides with our 
monthly breakfast, so we'll have breakfast at the Lyndon Diner across from the 
Autohaus.  Lyndon Diner, 665 Lancaster Rd, Manheim, PA 17545-2210 Phone: 
(717)664-4898 The show starts at 8AM, but I'm thinking more like 9-9:30 at the 
diner...that's already a 1 hour drive for us from the Lehigh Valley.  Let me 
know if anyone wants to caravan from this area.

BTW, sorry this kind of &quot;fun stuff&quot; isn't posted on a Friday, but the list was 
down when I wanted to post.
