&gt;  today i pulled it off the track and did my best pit
&gt; stop. new fuel filter again, check and recheck valve adjustment, pull 
&gt; and
&gt; recondition 30/31pict, double checked dwell, pulled and found a clean 
&gt; fuel
&gt; pump screen, and set timing statically. when i hit it with the timing 
&gt; light
&gt; i came upon something i'd never seen. the cut mark on the pully was at 4
&gt; o'clock and idle was good. (&quot;??!&quot;) it is supposed to be up at the split 
&gt; in
&gt; the case, r-r-right?  when i tried to bring the cut mark around to the 
&gt; top
&gt; the engine cut out, so i reset it statically, and ran for shelter. was 
&gt; dr.
&gt; volks von frankenstein here earlier? i cannot drive this bus. after two
&gt; blocks it stammers and clobbers itself back home. any ideas what i am
&gt; missing? please send forth wisdom, and thanks in advance - steve

steve,

1) what do your plugs look like?  Sounds like it almost could be running 
rich
	and/or your plugs could be fouled.  Are you still running the stock 
oil-bath air cleaner?

2) are you sure you had the timing light on the correct wire?

3a) are you *positive* you have all the wires going to the correct places
	(I've messed this up, and everyone I KNOW has messed this up,	 until someone 
else came along and actually was diligent enough
	 to physically check which wire went to which, and found a problem)

3b) are you positive you know where TDC for #1 is and have your 
distributor
	cap and wires positioned accordingly?  (this is a corellary to 3a)
	

4) does the distributor advance properly?  (this one comes after you get 
the
	light to flash directly at the crack in the case)

5) does the timing light stay steady through the entire advance curve or 
does
	it stop flashing at certain times?  This would indicate your condenser
	or coil might be bad...

TAKE YOUR TIME, and be thorough...that's the hardest part, but if you can
slow yourself down and pay attention, it'll get you fixed faster (even 
though
it seems painstakingly slow).

hope this helps.
