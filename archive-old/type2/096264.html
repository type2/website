&gt; I am trying to locate a supplier for a new oil pump for my 78 2000 cc FI

&gt; Depot but by the time I managed to squeeze the bucks out of my budget
&gt; they were gone! What to do now? Got a message back that they have the
&gt; cast iron Melling pumps. Don't know about them though, I've been warned
&gt; about using them since the 70's, The old steel vs aluminum expansion
&gt; argument. Almost everywhere I have looked this is all they sell.

???? I have never had any problems with the Melling pumps, one key is to
hone them in before using em
