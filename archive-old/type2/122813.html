Subject: Re: [T2] Friday-Actually there IS such a thing as a cheap bus

Yes, and people actually do win the lottery. But only a certified fool 
would think: &quot;i am going to buy a lottery ticket and quit my job, 
because other people have won the lottery and got to quit their jobs.&quot;

Sure, there are people who get lucky with buses. But if that were the 
COMMON experience, this would be a very different list. Most of the 
&quot;bus content&quot; on this list is about things that need to be fixed, most 
of which are not cheap to fix.

You can look backward to a lucky bus purchase, but you cannot look 
forward to one.

Counseling list subscribers to believe that they can get a bus for 
under $1000 and drive it for years without expense is a disservice -- 
not to mention dangerous. Not one of the lucky posters thus far have 
mentioned doing a complete brake job on their buses. Thirty-year old 
buses usually need new lines, hoses, drums, disks, calipers, springs, 
etc., etc., etc.

Maybe I was wrong to say there are no cheap buses. There are, of 
course. Everytime I go to Ecology Wrecking, I get to see 10 or 20 buses 
that Ecology picked up for $15 or $20 apiece.
