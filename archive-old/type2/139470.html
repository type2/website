Subject: Re: [T2]how many miles on a tank of gas

&gt; I don't know, but I find the lack of information frustrating.
&gt; Shouldn't there be a resource or web site listing all the common VW
&gt; engine displacements available and the correct jet sizes for the
&gt; common carb combinations being used?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Any consensus on the &quot;correct&quot; jets, etc. for a Weber on a 2L... ?-)

Have you seen:
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/weber-progressive.html
seems to be an error on that page, secondary idle jet I think should be 50
not 150.

Personally I don't have any good experiences with a progressive on a flat
four but for cross reference here are recommended settings for a Weber 32/36
on a BMW 2002 (2.0 L inline 4 watercooled):

Float Level 40mm

PRIMARY
idle 60
main 140
air correction 145

SECONDARY
idle 55
main 170
air correction 175

that should get you started.  these are on the rich side for the BMW and
would probably be safe to run for a VW.  also recommended to plug the
secondary enrichment passage, otherwise go down on that secondary main.
pmail me if you have questions.

another hint found online: &quot; If you have to open the mixture screw more than
2 turns on a 32/36 DGV or 38 DGES your idle jets are too small...If you have
to shut them below 1/2 turn they are too big....&quot;

also cf. the Datsun 510 page:
