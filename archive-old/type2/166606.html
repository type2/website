&gt; Yesterday after work I was able to get the drag link installed and the

&gt; take it for a drive around the block.  It made the most god awful
&gt; noise I've ever heard.  There was a terrible clunking from the rear end.

Now that you mention it, I had this X-ZACT same noise when  I re-mounted my
wheels to my van, and I forgot to torque the wheel nuts (to 94 ft/lb).  It
just took a  few blocks before I got the noise, and it was easy and
embarrassing to return home.

Let us know what your problem was.
