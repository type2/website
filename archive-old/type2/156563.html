Subject: Do not drive with sliding door open, ACHTUNG!!!

Hey guys,

      I was wondering if anyone knew where I could get some of the replacement OEM stickers for my Bus? I recently dissasembled the steering components inside the cabin, sanded them down and repainted them. You know that sticker that goes just forward of the steering wheel that says &quot;Do not drive with sliding door open&quot; (and then again in German), well... I'd really like to get a new one and put it on. Does anyone know where one might be available?

Thanks!!!

Todd
