Subject: Recent Parts purchases (71 Westy)

Hi folks,

I just received a water filler tube and screw cap (for the westy sink tank)
from Busboys to replace the remnants of my original.  As Busboy Jim warned
me, the part is now manufactured in gray (not the original white :( ) but
I'm happy just to get a new piece in there--my way of treating the bus and
me!  I think after the v_at_l discount it was about $12.90 (I didn't price
Euro-American).  The tube was accompanied with a cool-o Busboys sticker with
a red&amp;white splitty on it--looks great!

Also received an order from Rapid Parts.  Among the assorted Rabbit parts I
ordered was one part for the bus: a VDO 3 pot above dash gauge holder ($13)
(RMMW &amp; Busboys sell it for about the same).  It's exactly what I want to
mount my gauges and fits as well as I hoped.  I positioned it on the
dashboard to the left of the radio.  I'll be securing it with velcro to the
dashtop and routing the wiring through a couple of the speaker holes in the
center of the dash which the housing partly covers.  The nice features about
this holder is that it fully encloses the gauges, does not look strange from
the outside of the bus since it has a nice matching black grained finish,
does not require cutting to install gauges, and the pots are angled so with
the holder mounted to the right of the center, the gauges face you.  The
only major drawback I see is that it is really easy for the gauges to be
stolen (but the advantage is you could pull them out quickly with your tools
if your engine catches on fire ;) ). 

Anyhow, that's all I bought--I'm saving my pennies for the meet coming up on
August 25 at the Terryville Fairgrounds in Terryville, CT.  It's usually a
bug dominated affair but I hope to see a larger bus population this year.
