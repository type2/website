Subject: off-topic: best bus

[...]

Guys, i'm off topic here, but i have to disagree on both counts.  When joe
schmoe thinks of a bus, he thinks of a flower-covered split. not a loaf -
watch advertising (not to mention MOST bus-dead stickers/tshirts you'll see)
for evidence of this.

Splits may not be the 'best' busses, but they are definitely the &quot;symbolic
icon encapsulating the very soul of VW-dom...&quot; for the general populus.

also, A 72 is the worst loaf to have 'cause it has no top engine hatch and is
the first year of the pancake engine.

my .02 and pmail me - lets not F.A.R.T.

&gt; &gt; The bays (68s-71s anyway) are revered as the symbolic icon encapsulating
the
&gt; &gt; very soul of
&gt; &gt; VW-dom at it's finest. Everybody knows it. It's just that nobody wants to
&gt; &gt; admit to it!
&gt;  
&gt; Every vw is special. we could argue this point for ever and honestly i
&gt; think the best year was 72,
