&gt; I am going to put a '74 1.8L engine in a '72 Bus which would normally have

&gt; will the 1.8L clutch/flywheel etc. fit on the '72 trans. as it is?

   I'm not sure which diameter clutch you have -- but to get the '81
clutch and flywheel on the '81 engine I put in my '73 to fit, I had to
do some &quot;custom machining&quot; on the inside of the bellhousing. Like take a
&quot;rotary file&quot; in your drill and grind away on the lumps. I ran the 1700
flywheel and clutch for awhile but it died pretty quick, the 1800 might
not exert that much more power.
