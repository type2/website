Subject: Re: [T2]oil coming from dipstick ????

Chris, there must be a vacuum on the engine, you have
the line from the oil breather to the carb intake,
that should be enough, unless the line is
kinked(pinched off)and this would cause a problem.
Take the dipstick out and put a piece of gas hose on
the end of the dipstick tube and route it to the air
filter on the carb and see if this stops the leak.
Just something to try. We did have problems with the
dipstick, is the tube cracked, remember we had to bend
it back straight and run a rod through it so the
dipstick tube could be bad, cracked.. Just a thought.
