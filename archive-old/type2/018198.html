Subject: Are 1968 speedo's different?
Message-ID: &lt;374C4C94.8032B739_at_dds.nl&gt;

Hi Everyone,

A little while ago I noticed a speedo (I beleive you guys call it an
odo-meter, is that right?) in a 1968 which was different than all the
speedo's I saw on the newer busses.

It had the grey disk in the middle like all the pre 1973 speedos but it
had the mileage indicator in the lower half of the disc! Until then I
only saw the mileage displayed in the upper half of the grey disc.
Does anyone know when this was changed?
