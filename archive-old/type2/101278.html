Subject: Vanagon front suspension squeak

Hello Volks,

I'm sure someone out there has run into this problem. My 81 Vanagon has a
very loud and distintive, classic bedspring squeak. It originates from the
passenger side wheel well when going over speed bumps and the likes and
even if I sit or stand in the front seat and bounce.

First I replaced the front shocks. No difference. Then I took her to a shop
and had them replace both wishbone bushings on the right side. Ouch$$ That
procedure took care of the majority of the &quot;clunking&quot;. It also remedied the
squeak for about one day and within 5 days it has returned to it's usual
squeak.

Thinking some tweaking or adjustments could be made by the mechanic, I took
it back to the shop and they said sorry charlie, but if ya got more $ come
on in!
Chasing the noise is not a sound economical choice for me right now. My
dislike of repair shops continues to fester.

I don't know if my biggest problem is with this repair shop and it's
service, or with the continued frustration of having the NOise still around.

Anyways, if anyone can help it would be great. The mechanic was kind enough
to offer, at no charge, some suggestions. One, the vehicle now needs a
front end alignment, and two, the spring coil seat could use some grease.

P.S. I have a nicely done, under the dash, aftermarket AC system that is
looking for a good home. At this time I cannot ship it. Anyone interested?
