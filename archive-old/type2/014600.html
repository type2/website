Subject: Re: [T2] Alt. Cooling boot needed...Correct part #
To: RZ500N_at_home_dot_com

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

The cooling boot for the 55amp alt. is part # 021 903 655. It is still in 
production and available through a variety of sources. The part # for the 
70amp alt is 022 903 655. It is NLA. Kaput. Gonersville. The pully/fan assy. 
for the 70 amp alt is part # 022 903 109. It too has gone the way of the 
Dodo. I called Bosch of America today to ask about the chances of finding 
either of these two components. I was politely told to get stuffed. Moral of 
the story: If you've got the 70 amp alt, and the boot, treat it like it was 
made of gold, cause there ain't no more to be had. Pity really, as the 70 amp 
alt can easily be built to 90 amps by any competent rebuilder, and if you've 
upgraded any of the electrical components in your bus i.e.: CDI ign, 
inverter, H-4 lighting, stereo, etc., you already know that the 55 amp alt is 
marginal at best.
Thanks for the help,
Robb
