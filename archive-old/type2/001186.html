Well, you Americans THINK you cannot type characters with umlauts etc.
However it can be done on any keyboard.

So If you want to type an ü as in &quot;Fahrvergnügen&quot; you press the alt-key with
your left finger (assuming you only use two fingers for typing) and while
keeping the alt-key down pres the 1, 2 and 9 key on your numeric keypad with
your right finger. Then you release the alt-key and voila .....

This procedure makes you create a character with ascii value 129. Using this
method you can create any character out of the 255 available in the IBM
version of the ascii character set.
