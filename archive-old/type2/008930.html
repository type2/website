Hey Y'all,
  I know this is not the split list, but I am not on that list. In the
&quot;little Nickel&quot; a news paper in Wa state, there is a 56  Ambulance for
sale. It is missing the engine and most of the medical equiptment, but
has the &quot;oven door&quot; rear door, side step, divider, and fans. It is
complete minus the engine as far as bus stuff. I don't have the money
to buy it myself so I pass it on to you. Pick up a &quot;Little Nickel&quot; or
mail me and I will pass on the phone #. Some one please pass this on to
the split list.
