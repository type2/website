&gt;&gt; Like I said, turn off the the engine and try to stop in a 71-79 bus. It's much harder.

&gt;But that does not really answer the question - would it still be
&gt;harder if the brake booster was not in the system.

Yes it does. The booster is vacuum driven, kill the vacuum and you have the equivalent of no booster in the system.

&gt;There must be some
&gt;data somewhere about how much pressure is required to operate drum vs.
&gt;the disk.

Discs require more. I can't remember if Bentley has psi values for the braking system pressure but the numbers are huge.

&gt;I have no intention of downgrading my brakes or making my bus unsafe. 
&gt;But I also don't care for unnecessary complication.  I did get the
&gt;booster/linkages from the donor bus, and I WILL install the booster if
&gt;I find the brakes are not up to snuff without it.

I can't say I fully understand your logic. I want the best braking possible, not just good enough.
