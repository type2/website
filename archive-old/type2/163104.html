&gt; Our bus list supplkiers all have it and NAPA had my '97 VW Cabrio when 
&gt; I was in a pinch last year. It is visually identical to my '78 Westy's 
&gt; switch - didn't compare numbers.

It wouldn't surprise me one bit if the switch was the same.  I put a 
&quot;new&quot; switch in my '75 a couple weeks ago with one from an '87 Jetta, 
and replaced the switch-engaging tab on the lock with one scavenged out 
of a Golf.  Both parts were identical to mine.
