Subject: Re: [T2] found an engine....

Anyone driven a bus with the early tranny bolted to a Type IV engine? I have not. Longer stroke engine than original Type I. I have driven my Beetle with a stock 1500cc gearbox (ratio unknown to me) and another Beetle with only 40 HP but bolted to the 3.88 gearbox (highest Beetle/Ghia gear ratio box) and it was less than thrilling. My Type IV Beetle witht he 1500cc gearbox really pulled but turned &quot;too hard&quot; by my opinion on the interstate. 40 HP bug would have gone 100 mph but it ran out of steam at 100 kph unless downhill with a tailwind. 

Don't forget the gear ratios involved.
