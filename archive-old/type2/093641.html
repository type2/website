&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; This would be too hard to describe, so here are a couple of images.
&gt; The first is a picture of what I have, and the second id a graph 
&gt; showing all of the parts that should be there. This is on a 76 westy.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have a spare parts bus, or know of a location where I could 
&gt; aquire the parts I am missing here?
