Subject: Side Vent Wing Seals are back

Just a note that I have received about a dozen more of the side window vent
wing seals that have been so elusive. These are for the vent wing section of
the side window (not door window) on a bus. I posted them to the list a
while back, but quickly sold out. Price is $59.95, part number 221 847 673A.
So far availability has been inconsistent to say the least, so if you need
one (or a pair) in the near future you may want to grab them while they're
hot.
