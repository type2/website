&gt;Ok, so I've finally gotten frustrated with not having the right tools to
&gt;work on my bus, and my birthday is coming up, so I have a couple of tool
&gt;questions for the list (and will probably start a religious war in the
&gt;process).  This is mostly regarding sockets, screwdrivers, wrenches and
&gt;simple automotive test equipment.
&gt;

So nice when you ask good questions BEFORE you spends your money.

&gt;1. What brand of tools have you found to be reasonably (everthing is
&gt;relative here) priced but built well enough that you won't have to worry
&gt;about snapping your wrench in half getting those exhaust bolts out?

S-K is what I would consider the good quality serious do it yourselfer
quality. Some 'professionals' who think they can't afford Snap-On, Mack,
Matco, etal, use them.
They cost half to 2/3 the price of the true professional lines. 

S-K also markets the Facom line from France and are similar good quality.

Hazet will do you proud on any DM machine and run about 3/4 the cost of
SnapOn. They are the only full DIN standard line available through a few US
suppliers, being of course made in der Fatherland. Nothing fits better day
in and day out than DIN standard. Stawhille (sp) is another good German
brand with likewise high quality.

DIN standard is kept in mind by the Neandereers so they can make sure that
any fastener on their design that cannot be serviced with a DIN tool gets a
specially made tool to do the job. 

Craftsman are cheaper, both in cost and results, and more and more so as
fewer and fewer items in the line are made in USA. They have been waffling
on their free replacement guaranty of late, however. I consider there use
in a professional shop to be negligence 'cause they will fail you from time
to time. In particular some of the screwdrives are junk, IMAAAO.

&gt;
&gt;2. What's the big deal between 6 point sockets/wrenches and 12 point
&gt;sockets/wrenches?  Why would I want to have one over the other, or both?

Six point sockets will turn a worn bolt/nut when a 12 point will slip. 12
Point are quicker to set on the fastner and give more range and better
access to fasteners in tight places.

&gt;
&gt;3. How often (if ever) am I going to need deep sockets or universal sockets
&gt;or crowfoot wreches or anything beyond the basic socket/extension/handle
&gt;configuration?

Deep sockets are essential. They work mo betta in many situations. Brake
lines require flare wrenches. FI fuel filters require either DIN standard
or flare wrenches. Universals are very handy but if not of high quality
easy to break on a tough nut. I broke one this last week. 
13mm, $45 to replace. And that was a Snap-On, but it was a swelt 1/4&quot; drive
and I was using it in a 3/8&quot; drive arena.

Crowsfeet are handy but not essential on a T-II. S shaped obstruction
wrenchs can make a lot of things much easier. I use them a lot and can't
imaging working without them. They have made my day many times.

Other typically good quality names are Proto (but watch out, they have a
cheap line out now, buy the US stuff only), Williams, Gedore (DIN), Heyco
(DIN), 

Stay away from no name Chinese stuff. But you already knew that, didn't
you. It will be very interesting to see what kind of products we'll be
trading for if the trade agreement goes through.

If you ask Taiwan to make a tool to high specs, they can do it. Just few
ever asks them.

Relative pricing. $250 worth of SnapOn equals $175 S-K/Facom equals $100 US
Craftsman equals $200 Hazet equals $19.95 Harbor Freight Chinese.

Just off the top of my head, above the brow ridge.
