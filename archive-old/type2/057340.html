&gt; Before I put the motor back in a couple of weeks and say &quot;Why didn't I

&gt; might want to do while it is out?  Like preventive maintenance things.

If dual port, replace the manifold boots.

Now is the time to make sure all the tin is there and in good shape. 
Any cracks should be brazed and any rust should be taken care of.

Same thing with the heat exchangers.  Now is the time to braze up any
holes, and to fix the holes where the pipes go into the sheet metal
box if they are egg-shaped.

Since you have the tin off to work on it, you should retorque the
cylinder heads.

Put in a new clutch disc.

Clean and repair the entire engine bay.  If the battery tray needs
attention,now is the time!

Make sure that the fuel line grommet is in good shape where the metal
line passes through the tin.  If not, you can substitute a 2 inch wide
strip of inner tube wrapped around the line and pushed snugly into the
hole in the tin.

Make sure that the fuel pump and carburator inlets/outlets are seated
firmly in their castings.  If not, clean them, scratch the surface
slightly, and reinstall with JB-Weld.

Is this turning into a project or what?  :)
