You WILL NOT save money having it done by a local shop.  Go the bus boys
route.  I have the tool, and can do it myself by borrowing a press at my
friend's shop, but it still ain't easy.............Machine shop could easily
charge $100 to press them in and out.....and then, if you do not show them
in the Bentley how to index them, could still be wrong.
