Subject: gas heater

Hey, all -

my landlord just gave me a gas heater he had tucked in his shop for a 
while &amp; swears it's from an old bus...  It is 6 volt and states &quot;mfg 
by Perfection, division of Hupp Corp, Cleveland, OH.  Model PC1500.  
Is this familiar at all to anyone?  I've heard of a number of VW gas 
heater brands, but this rings no bells... Anyone with info or 
literature?  Thanks
