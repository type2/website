Subject: Stainless Stell/Steel bimetallic corrosion problems?

No one says anything so I must insist:

According to my vague knowledge and to what I have read on the 
net putting stainless steel parts on a bus will increase the corrosion
rate everywhere else. (I used to think this wasn't true for stainless
steel but I read otherwise)

This applies to battery trays, stainless steel screws, etc.

Any chemical engineers on the list that can enlighten us?
Please...

P.S. I can go ask on my other vehicle lists: the Brompton bike list and
the GS motorcycle list, I won't because those two vehicles I can
replace, the bus I can't: good ones are increasingly hard to find
