Subject: Anyone want exhuast manifolds for 77?

I couldn't think of a succinct subject line
for this-&gt;

I have an exhuast system from my 77 that would
be good for someone looking to experiment.
It's just the manifold part that bolts to
the head up to the U joint.
 
I had to cut off the heater boxes, so from the
U forward is just straight. One of the ports will
need built up with a little metal.
 
send me some mail so I can stop tripping over
it.
