Hi there,  

The following is some info on a VWoA &quot;Campertent&quot; that I have up for sale
on the Type2 website classified ad.

This is &quot;not&quot; a Westfalia provided &quot;Add-a-Room&quot; tent.  This is a tent that
VWoA initially had made for any model of the VW Bubble window Bus.  It
should mate up with most any other era or model of Bus too.  It was
distributed through the VWoA Dealership network as an accessory
&quot;Campertent&quot; for Transporters.  It's VW part number is ZVW 199 101.  It
features a 9'6&quot; x 9'6&quot; floor, a 7' ceiling  at it's peak, and according to
VWoA's sales literature, 90 square feet of guest room.  It's a free
standing tent, so you can detach and drive away to sightsee or go for
supplies.  It features a zippered flap or door that affords privacy between
the Volkswagen Bus and the Campertent when desired.  it has large screened
side and front windows with zippered privacy flaps.  The listed weight is
approximately 50 lbs, and comes complete with it's original cream colored
zippered vinyl storage bag. 

Many folks who bought the regular passenger models back then (and now)
would still like to take their families out camping.  Back then, they could
go to their VW dealership Parts Dept. and buy this style of sliding door
mounted &quot;Add-a-Room&quot; style tent to use with their normal Busses to make
them more functional while camping or on vacation.  I believe VW had these
tents made for those folks in particular, as well as for the folks who
initially ordered Westfalia's but didn't opt for the Westy tent.  I've seen
it marketed in Bubble window Bus VW accessory pamphlets.  This tent would
be very &quot;correct&quot; for the &quot;VW purist&quot;, as well as very functional for any
Transporter.  You can see a photo of this tent on Joe Clark's Tent Page
website.  His website photo shows the tent attached to a Campmobile Bus in
a '77 VW Bus sales brochure.  The address to view it is:

I haven't set up this tent for about six years, but as I remember, it is in
very nice condition.  I do seem to remember that it has one door zipper
that needs to be repaired.  It's complete, and I remember being impressed
with how nice the condition of the fabric and floors were.  I've stored it
all this time in my de-humidified basement, waiting for the day that I
bought a nice mid '70's Bus to hang it on.  But I have a nice '67 Westy
with  it's own tent, and an '87 Vanagon Westfalia with a awning.  I finally
saw it the other day and decided that someone else will get better use of
it than I.  That's why I'm making it available now, just in time for the
upcoming camping season.   I'll try to set it up later on this week so I
can describe it better.  I've been pleasantly suprised at all the e-mail
requests from the ad! 

After I've had a chance to set up and inspected the tent again, I'll have a
better idea of what I'll be asking for it, but for right now, I imagine the
price will be in the $400 range, with the best offer getting this very nice
condition &quot;Campertent&quot;.  I'll be happy to try to answer any other
questions, but p-mail me directly, not the List.
