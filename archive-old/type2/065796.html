Howdy Monster Truck Fans!

If anyone out there would be innerested in receiving a scan of the Earl
Schieb Blue, Hacked up 61 Single Cab 'mounted' on a 4x4 truck frame, email
me back and I'll send a .jpg image file to you.  Special thanks to Turbo
Thom for the scan!  Perhaps it's destined for the 'Bus Hall of Shame'!
