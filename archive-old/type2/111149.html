Subject: exhaust tip sizes

Hello all-
 
I installed a new exhaust last night but the exhaust tip, connected to the dampener pipe, that I received with the new exhaust is smaller than the one that was installed on the old exhaust.  The new one is about 1 inch in diameter compared to the old one which was about 2 inches.  Will this smaller diameter tip affect the performance of the engine and, more importantly, will it restrict the exhaust to the point where it will be doing harm to the engine?  It's a 1970 1600 upright.  Thanks in advance.
