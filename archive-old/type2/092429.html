Subject: Re: [T2] escutcheon tool

Hi Steve,

I think you are talking about the silver coloured rings around the base of (for example) the headlight switch which need to be unscrewed in order to remove the switch.

If so then I use a pair of circlip pliers with curved nose to remove them. I've just got a cheep set (Radio Shack / Tandy from memory) with interchangeable ends (curved and straight, large and small) which work for for interior and exterior circlips.

Good luck
