Subject: gen. update: time wasted

i replaced the brushes in my generator.
(polarized it, just in case.)
Fired the bus up.
after a half minute the gen light went out!

took it for a drive and everything was fine until i
turned on the headlights.
then the gen light came on and stayed on--even when
the lights were turned off.

returned and checked voltage--battery read about 13v.
no matter what the rpms.

turned off the engine to try a no-load test, but the
battery was dead and couldn't start again.

I'm really an amateur at this and Unless y'all've got
a better idea...I'm getting an alternator tomorrow and
hunting down the parts for a switch. (Worry: My
brazilian 34 pict does look like it leaves much room
for an alternator.)

I've got a couple of trips coming up and I don't want
any roadside headaches.
