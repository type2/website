Subject: FI vacuum dizzy on 73

Well, I really need to figure out this vacuum advance thing.

The 73 has a vacuum cutoff switch (that was disabled obviously when
the 009 was in there) that only allows vacuum when 4th gear is engaged
or when the temps are really low.

What benefit does this have in the performance of the engine?

And, no, I haven't sold her yet. ;-)

Thanks,
Don
