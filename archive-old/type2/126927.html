Subject: Re: [T2] dumb CDI questions

&gt; So I installed the CDI yesterday and it runs great.
&gt; Then I decided to drag out my tach dwell to double
&gt; check the advance curve and hooked it up as per normal
&gt; (ie to the negative side of the terminal and ground)
&gt; and it didnt work...duh... so where do I hook the dang
&gt; thing up to now?

flip the cdi into bypass and you can measure the dwell.
