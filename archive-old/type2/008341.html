Ok I am all for keeping things original, at least as far as the body goes
but lets face it if they'd of had some of the nice things we have now
they'd of used em..

That said does anyone know of a source for  either an overdrive unit or
preferably a 5 speed 
gearbox for a bay window bus. 


Also would like leads on a gas heater, and a drive away tent  for this 72
camper   

Any information would be greatly appreciated.
