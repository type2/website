Subject: Re: [T2] Well, another 'runs 3 seconds' bus

Hey Tim,

Wiring hasn't been messed with and we maintain 36 psi fuel pressure  
throughout.  Bus was running fine then just lost power _at_ 20 mph and  
quit.  It's done it half a dozen times.  Tow it home, go through  
EVERYTHING yet again and suddenly it starts and runs just fine.  This  
morning, I messed with it for a couple hours, ended up unplugging the  
feed from the coil to the double relay it coughed a couple times then  
started and ran with the key in the start position.  Plugged the  
double relay power back in and it fired right up.  Ran it in the  
driveway for thirty minutes, jazzing the throttle and all.  Shut it  
down.  Started it back up. A dozen times.  Still fine.  Ole lady  
comes out and says, &quot;Is it fixed?&quot; I say I dunno. She says I'll take  
it to the store. She leaves, gets to store (about 1/2 mile away),  
does her thing, comes back out ten minutes later and the bloody thing  
won't start.  Tow it home yet again.

I BELIEVE in FI, I really do, (and I understand it) but those baby  
Dels are looking better every time I have to drag it home.

Jim

&gt; Holy Man, BatShlt. As you know, with key on start, fuel pump gets  
&gt; volts from switch. When the key is in run (after starting), the  
&gt; fuel pump gets it's volts from the switch in the AFM. Sounds to me  
&gt; like you simply must have wiring fouled up. Either hooked up wrong  
&gt; or cross feed in a worn harness. That is just pure logic. I would  
&gt; hook up a volt meter to the fuel pump + terminal and verify volts  
&gt; during testing to confirm what's happening.
