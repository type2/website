Subject: Re: [T2] Shipping costs

&lt;&lt;Terry spouted his usual BS again.&gt;&gt;

Nay Nay Karl,
Just quoting what the soul train gang USPS employee's have been telling
me for the last year or so---
&quot; Priorty Mail ( which used to be 2-3 days) has no guaranted delivery
tie.
Ask them---you'll see.

 &lt;&lt;I mail stuff EVERYDAY. I damn near have a reserved parking spot.&gt;&gt;

I do have a reserved spot---and I do ship every day---

&lt;&lt;I don't read propaganda on the internet, just your rantings.&gt;&gt;

You piced this BS up somewhere--and it wasn't me---

 &lt;&lt;Maybe it is your post office in Podunk Illinois??&gt;&gt;

It be---at every PO within a 10 mile radius of my crib--and the mailman
in his jeep sez the same thing.

&lt;&lt;If your Priority mail doesn't make it in 2-3 days, then they aren't
feeding the horses at your Pony Express office.&gt;&gt;

Nope--Dog Sleds----

More than once I have mailed items to the same place using 1st class, &amp;
priority, and the item's have arrvived at the same time--regardless what
the kaptain kangaroo screen sez at the PO.

Priorty mail service has no longer gauranteed delvery times--ask them
live and be reinfored--forget what the screen sez---

I ask this question every day-how long?

Then they'll tell you the rest of the story--

Try it--ask the question of Leon, the PO Peon.
See what he sez---
