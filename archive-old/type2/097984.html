Why is this VW driver different from all other VW drivers?

Richard, *NO ONE* greases rear bearings at the recommended intervals.
OK, maybe Rick does, but he has a custom tool.  Rick.. POST PICTURES!!!!

This is the sort of job that is just too difficult.  You wait for failure,
then replace.  Certainly I do, and I regard it as the sane way to go (but
remember who is deciding what &quot;sane&quot; is :-(

&gt; &gt; 1971-1992 are all the same.  The only difference between the V'gon and the
&gt; &gt; bay is that the bearing housing on the V'gon comes off, so you can do it
&gt; &gt; on the bench (a HUGE advantage!!!)
&gt;
&gt; So Steve, How hard is this?

Richard,

It isn't hard, just wearing. someone else posted that you should plan on a
full day and I strongly agree.  Your steps are OK, but I have three
points of difference with the manuals....

First, again I say that getting the stub axle out of the bearings is the
hardest part.  With the big Snap-On CJ pullers, it goes fine, but back at
the beginning of my VW career.... it was bad.  I finally resorted to a
no-no that a jack-leg machinist friend taught me and got away with it.  I
reversed the castellated nut and turned it on flush with the end of the
stub axle and drove it out with a BFH.  This is *NOT* recommended by
anyone, but sometimes you do what you have to do.  the brass drift idea
sounds like a winner, but I have not tried it.

Second, something that Bentley and Muir imply is that the spacer between
the the inner and outer bearings will come out and in my experience it
*won't*!  you have to punch around it to get the outer bearing out.  And
it is full of grease, and you have to remember that there is *not* a
shoulder there! which means you have to be careful not to scar the housing
too badly as you drive it.

The third incredible &lt;euphemism&gt;bear&lt;/euphemism&gt; is the circlip.  I have
found no common tool that will remove it peacably.  First, you get *ONE*
shot at pulling it with a pair of needle-nose pliers, after which you have
rounded it and it *won't* come out.  After that, I wound up customizing a
pair of chinese needle nose pliers with my dremel tool.  No internal
C-clip tool I have found is strong enough for this pup, I am sorry to say
and I have broken more than a few on it.
