Subject: Installing a 78 2.0 L into a 74 Westy

 &gt;one other note i just remembered.. the 091 bellhousing requires longer 
studs and
 &gt;bolts for the engine to attach to the bellhousing... you can use 
spacers.. if
 &gt;you have the engine from a 002 bellhousing , the bolts and studs are 
too short

OK...Now I know why the two lower studs are too short to catch more than 
3 threads !  My setup is exactly the same, (78 2.0 L into a 74).  
Sooooooo what do I do about it?  The &quot;holes&quot; in the engine casing seem 
to have some sort of washer set-up in them but they are not removable 
(at least at first glance).   Can anything be done to &quot;fix&quot; this 
situation short of getting a new tranny?
