&gt;I also talked to a Kern County Sheriff one day about the status of RV for a
&gt;vehicle. I read somewhere (probably in the CA Law) that a vehicle must have
&gt;3 or 4 of the following:

&gt;Stove, Sink, Shower, Fridge, Shidder, Bed, and maybe a Dining table.

&gt;Anyway, he said the &quot;State of California Department of Housing&quot; plate on
&gt;Itch qualifies nicely.

&gt;FWIW -

&gt;69 Westy &quot;Itch&quot;

	I just tried to have my 81 Westy insured as an RV (that is in
Delaware if it makes any difference). It needed a fixed build-in toilette
to qualify as a RV. So it seems it needs all of the above mentioned items.

	Karl.
