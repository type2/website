Seal for end of heater cable 1968-79 - part No JK8242 - cost 3.75 each
Thats UK pounds translating to about $5.50 US. Less Tax for export + 
postage.

Orders may be made with Visa/Mastercard.

Usual disclaimer of no commercial interest. Just Kampers are starting to 
have made lots of these little parts that VW is no longer interested
in themselfs and are a good source for resoration parts.
