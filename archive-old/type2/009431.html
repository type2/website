Dave, thanks for your response.  Sounds like you know what I'm talking
about.  When reinstalling the servo, I did lengthen the accuator rod,
which helped, but did not solve the problem.  I'm also concerned that
lengthening the rod too much will cause the brake lights to activate
and cause wear on the brake pads if it actually pressurizes the master
cylinder.  Also, I did replace the hoses with hose from  the local
parts store.  It could be that the hose is too soft and is collapsing
under the vacuum, but I don't think that is the case. My guess is that
there is some trick I'm missing about mating up the actuator rod-to-the
vacuum assist-to-the master cylinder, but having put it together twice
(bleeding the brakes to do it, ugh) I'm mystified.  Either that or I've
got low vacuum and the servo just won't retract.  Either way, I'm still
stumped.

&gt; Andrew.... don't know if this will help.  I had to
&gt; replace the master 
&gt; cylinder on my '73 a few weeks back.... one of the
&gt; things as part of the 
&gt; disassembly was removing the accuator rod between
&gt; the brake pedal and the 
&gt; servo... loosened the lock nut and shortened the
&gt; length.  Reassembly required 
&gt; making sure there was the correct length on the
&gt; accuator rod... seated firmly 
&gt; into the servo, then make sure the brake pedal was
&gt; at full retraction, screw 
&gt; out the rod to get the correct length.  Proceedures
&gt; I followed were in 
&gt; Bentley.
&gt; 
&gt; Any chance that there might be too much shortening
&gt; in the accuator rod?  (not 
&gt; long enough, not seated in the servo properly, brake
&gt; pedal not full retracted 
&gt; before adjusting the length of the rod)
&gt; 
&gt; May not help, but only other thing I can think of is
&gt; bad ends on the vaccum 
&gt; hose both at the master cylinder side and the servo
&gt; side...I had to clamp 
&gt; both of my hoses...they are pretty rotted out at the
&gt; ends....until I can get 
&gt; new hose.
