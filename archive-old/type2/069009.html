Subject: Re: cutting out in FI buses

I had a fun little cutting out incident in my '78 on the way back from
Seneca.  I had just refueled at a Citgo and Pat and I had parted ways.
I got on 66 and on the first huge uphill the bus starts bucking and
generally being nasty.  I let off the gas a lot and slowed down a lot in
the process and the bucking went away.  Then near-floored it again to
see if the problem would come back and it never did.  Never had the
problem after that either.  I believe that since it occured right after
filling up, I must have got a nice shot of water from that Citgo pump.

Pain in the ass.

&gt; I've seen a lot of posts recently about cutting out in FI buses.
&gt; I thought I'd share my experience, point of reference being a 
&gt; 79 FI bus.
&gt; 
&gt; The first problem occurred when I would be on the highway, doing 60
&gt; mph, and on flat ground.  It would cut out for a second or two,
&gt; but then everything would be fine the rest of the trip.
&gt; This would happen every time I got on the highway.
&gt; Solution: new Bosch fuel filter and a bottle of Techron.
&gt; I pulled the fuel filter and it was gummed up.
&gt; The solution fixed that problem permanently.
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, 2 years after the above problem, the engine would cut out
&gt; when going up hills in 3rd gear.  I'd have to shift to 4th, because 
&gt; the engine did not want to be at high rpm's.  By shifting to 4th, I was
&gt; lugging the engine and it was a bad situation. 
&gt; Solution: add a bottle of dry gas to the fuel.  
&gt; The problem immediately disappeared.
&gt; I probably got a &quot;bad&quot; batch of fuel...
&gt;  
&gt; BTW on 2 separate instances I found Purolator fuel filters leak.
