&gt; Indian Head gasket goop. It is a thin dark colored &quot;glue&quot; that an old

&gt; It acts like a sealant and a light glue and I have taken to applying it to
&gt; everything including the seating surface of crank and shaft seals.
&gt;
&gt; Can't hurt and I think (THINK) it keeps my motors a little bit drier. You
&gt; can also apply it to studs and such...

Hylomar sealant is also good stuff.  It's non-hardening and doesn't seem
to be affected by heat or oil.  It is apparently used by VW de Mexico on
their new production engines.
