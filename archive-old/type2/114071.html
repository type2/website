Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding door removal

&gt;Now that I know how to remove the chrome trim around the beltline, my next
&gt;question is how does the sliding door remove?  Also. how heavy is it?

Remove the trim over the slider track behind the slider door. Two screws - 
one at each end of the trim piece. Large Phillips.

Knock this piece of trim upward with rubber mallet to remove.

Look at track.

Notice point about 5 inches behind the closed position where the rear 
slider is when the door is closed. This &quot;open&quot; point is where you can take 
the rear slider off the rear track. Roll door to that point and lift door 
off rear slider track.

Slide rearward. When front rollers get to rear most point in track the door 
will hinge outward and will come off.

1 person can do it, 2 are easier. Check your Bentley manual for the best 
description and pics.

Good luck!
