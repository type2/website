Subject: Re: [T2] 71 bus charcoal filter canisters still available?

What is the 73 bus's e-cannister shaped like? The 71's is shaped like an 
ovaled cylinder, like a small muffler.

&gt;This is what I see when I use the link. It goes into details about how to cut a 1.5 inch hole in the canister and put activated charcoal in it and seal it up. This is for a 73 that is mounted on the roof of the engine compartment above the engine, not the battery. So it may not be helpful to you. Hope this helps.

&gt;Insofar as the charcoal canister (E-Can) goes..........do know that you 
&gt;should be able to blow through it without any restriction.  To test it, simply pull 
&gt;(disconnect all the hoses) the canister out of the system and blow through 
&gt;larger opening on the end with two openings.  If you get resistance or its 
&gt;completely plugged (and many are) it's time to clean.
&gt;
&gt;To clean it out you will need to refill the canister.  So..........drill a 
&gt;1.5 inch hole 1.5 inches in from the end with the two openings.  Once that is 
&gt;done you'll see the carbon (charcoal) pellets.  You'll probably need to poke 
&gt;them around a bit to loosen them.  I used a dull screwdriver - worked great.  
&gt;Once all the carbon is out take a look inside.  You should see a golden color.  I 
&gt;believe the inside was anodized.  If there is a lot of rust or unremovable 
&gt;crud inside, think about getting a new canister (more about that later).  Any 
&gt;light dirt can be rinsed out with a light solvent.  I'd recommend a water based 
&gt;cleaner like Marine Clean or Simple Green.  Just pour about a half pint in and 
&gt;let it soak for a bit.  
&gt;
&gt;Do not remove the internal &quot;pads&quot; at either end of the canister.  The cleaner 
&gt;should do a good job of rinsing them out.  However, because it's nearly 
&gt;impossible to align the pad and fill the can with fresh charcoal (and the springs 
&gt;get all screwed up when you dump the old charcoal), you will need to remove the 
&gt;springs at the &quot;far end&quot; (the end with one opening only) of the can.  This 
&gt;can be done by &quot;screwing&quot; the springs out of the hole you drilled previously.  
&gt;Just tip the pad at that end and grab the springs with a pair of needle nose.  
&gt;When the can is all dried up, the springs are out, and the pad is back in 
&gt;place refill with new carbon.  Just pack as much as you can possibly get into the 
&gt;can.  Be sure to get pelletized carbon which is available at any good 
&gt;pet/fish/aquarium store.  I found Coralife packaged in a half gallon container.  
&gt;You'll need two of these.  The canister will take just a little more than a half 
&gt;gallon of the stuff.  I got it for $6.95 for a half gallon container..
&gt;
&gt;You can seal that 1.5 inch hole any way you think best as long as it is 
&gt;airtight.  Me?  I soldered in a screw cap fitting (I think I used one from an old 
&gt;can of Thompson's Water Seal).  This way I can unscrew the cap and change the 
&gt;carbon in the future with no big hassle.  Reinstall the canister and you are on 
&gt;your way.
&gt;
&gt;Total time spent on the project (assuming the parts and tools you'll need are 
&gt;at hand) was less than one hour.  An easy weekend project to get no more gas 
&gt;smell and a less polluting vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;Oh yes.......about finding a new canister.  They are available for cheap at a 
&gt;most VW oriented wrecking yards.  I would not pay over $5.00 for one and most 
&gt;I have bought have been in the $1 or $2 range.  If you can get into the yard 
&gt;yourself (like a Pick-a-Part kinda yard) look for an E-Can from a Porsche 914. 
&gt; It's the exact same E-Can as used in Bugs and Busses (70-74, I think) and 
&gt;its located in the front trunk.  It is protected from the elements and will be 
&gt;in much better shape than one from a Bus or Bug.

&gt;
&gt;Thanks, Corbett, but are you sure about that link? It does discuss how 
&gt;later-model (later than 71, anyway) canisters are connected up but 
&gt;doesn't go into obtaining, fabricating, or recharging the 71 canister -- 
&gt;the type that is hung on the roof of the engine compartment, above the 
&gt;battery.
