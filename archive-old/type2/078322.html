sorry looks like that link was broken

goto the EASTWOODCOMPANY_dot_com  webpage
and search for part number #46048
Find TDC (top dead center) with the &quot;whistle&quot; quickly, easily, and precis=
ely
every time! As the piston rises in the cylinder, compressed air escapes
through the whistle. When the Whistle stops, the piston is at TDC. It's t=
hat
simple! Dual thread pattern (14mm and 18mm) with attached 22&quot; hose fits m=
ost
engines. Attached extension reaches into tight access areas.
