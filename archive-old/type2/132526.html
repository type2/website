Subject: New VW

You all are great!  I have learned so much so far.
I have been lurking the list for a while saving money to get my new (to me)
'77 T-2 home.
I have got it in the driveway now (chocked, blocked and E-brake set).

I have two new Michelin (cost a lot for OEM tires) Aglis on the back, the
old P-whatever (need replaced also) on the front.
I took the CV joints off to tow it home as it is an auto westfalia, (mine
were held on with 6 mm hex cap screws).
I have gotten it to turn over and fire up on starting fluid, however, it
does not run yet.

I am going to be doing some cleaning for a while before I start on the
engine work.
I want to get it running and smoged (yes, I am in California) before
spending a bigerest pot of money.
The brakes work (E-brake works great), brake hoses will wait for a (short
hopefully) while.

I have Mur, Bentley and Haynes books and the list, so I can not fail.
