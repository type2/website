Subject: valve saga

Hello,
I have a 77 Westy with 2.0 FI motor. I was adjusting the valves last 
weekend, and i found i couldn't get my feeler gauge in on the center valve 
for the #2 cyl. I loosened the rocker arm adjustment all the way out, and 
still couldn't get it in. I then approxamated how tight it should be based 
on the others and let it go. It runs fin, but not quite as powerful as it 
used to. Am i in trouble?
-jeremy
