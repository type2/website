Hey guys, anyone see an opportunity arise from brother
Snoopy's statement here?!?!  Do we have anyone out
there with publishing contacts?  How about a U.S. Bus
only magazine printed by &quot;Type2.Com Publishing&quot;! It
could be a way for the list to support itself
financially...If only I had some investors...and some
printing equipment...and some photography
equipment...and at least some knowledge of
printing\publishing...and a travel budget...then I
would print one hell of a U.S. Bus only monthly
magazine;^)!!!  
Oh well, back to my coma now...............
