&gt;Hi Edward,
&gt;
&gt;I've heard your job will be a lot easier if you get a
&gt;letter from VW confirming it meets all applicable US
&gt;requirements.  I've also heard VW only sends these
&gt;letters to the original owner.  Assuming no other
&gt;problems, how much will you save?
&gt;
Going the other way, any vehicle coming from the US into B.C. (importation
of vehicles into Canada depends more on the province than on the country)
that is more than 25 years old is a collectors car, and doesn't have to
meet any regs at all.  Don't you have something like that in the US?
