Subject: Shredded Hoses

On my 1970, the two hoses that run from fan shroud to heat exchangers each got
a nice little tear where they pass through the engine tin. Is there anything I
can put around those holes  to soften the edges so I'm not changing them along
with the oil every 3,000 miles?

BTW, I spent the Saturday doing some stuff to my bus, one thing was replacing
my crankshaft pulley with a nice new SCAT degree pulley. To get to the
crankshaft nut I had to remove my exhaust system because one of the pipes
blocked my way. Anyways, the point of this is to say thanks to the list.
Reading everyone's posts each day gave me the guts to keep taking apart and
then (thankfully) put back together. I'm not the most mechanically inclined
guy but I got through it. You guys serve as an inspiration to guys like me who
don't know much, but are trying to take the Muir challenge (make it run
forever)
Thanks
