&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt;      Well it looks like I will be pulling the engine out of my 79 camper.
&gt; This is nothing new but I have a question.  I would like to be able to pull
&gt; the motor without a second person helping me.  With a regular floor jack
&gt; that is a little dicey.

I pull the engine solo with a floor jack.  I added a 3/4 plywood platform
to a cheap (harbor freight) floor jack.  The platform is slightly narrower
than the oil sump.  This isn't the most stable arrangement, but the engine
will sit on the platform nicely.  I always keep a hand on top of the fan
shroud while rolling the jack around, and always lower the jack completely
before rolling.

The jack is small enough to be part of my road-trip tool kit.

&gt; Would a transmission jack allow me to do this?  Do
&gt; most of them have the reach for this?  Have any of you done it this way?

I've not done it, but having pulled a few transmissions with such a jack I
would think  that it would be the &quot;Cadillac&quot; way to go.  If you've got the
bucks, go for it!
