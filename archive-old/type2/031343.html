&gt; Im assisting in getting my roommates westy ready for her big road trip and 
&gt; one thing I thought Id like to tackle is help seal up the area just below 
&gt; the front window, you know, where all the rust is?
&gt; 
&gt; Just below the window seal there are a bunch of really little holes, and im 
&gt; assuming that everytime it rains this is where all the water is coming in 
&gt; and puddling all over inside.
&gt; 
&gt; Any do it yourself tricks to seal this up, better than it is now anyway? 
&gt; Looks arent important on this bus, just functionality so if its ugly, but 

quick and dirty but works until in can be done right,  Metal tape used by
contractors when putting insulation in houses, big roll of it is only a
few bucks

try Home Depot or Lowe's
