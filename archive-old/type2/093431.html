Art,
The above would be needed for a complete SP to DP conversion, I would think.

I want to stay as an SP engine, but just increase the cooling capacity of 
the engine to the higher air volume and increased oil cooler size used on 
the DP engines.

So, I am thinking I only need the deeper design fan housing, larger volume 
fan, larger capacity cooler, and maybe some accommodation components to 
marry same all to the SP engine.

For the fan housing,
I understand the fan housing must be able to house the larger dog house cooler,
and there is an option for accommodating  &quot;with&quot; and &quot;without&quot; -- air ducts.

Why are the use of air ducts an optional design consideration?
