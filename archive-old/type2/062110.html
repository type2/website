Subject: Re: Uk has no imperila gals --Convert Imperial to US mpg

&gt;While I was in the UK last week they have no gallons
&gt;They only have litres (not liters)  and so it is only academic for those with
&gt;old manuals

Evidently it is not academic for Australians. ;) And them debating whether
to divest themselves of the Queen, when the Brits don't even use Imperial
gallons anymore. Pitiable. I think the Queen ought to divest herself of the
English and move to Australia where she can get things in proper measures.
They tried to teach *us* metric, but we laughed at them. ;)
