Subject: 74 tranny problem

Hello,
Today I went out to take my first legal, insured,
registered drive in my new 74 westy with 1600 engine.
My first thing was to go to the gas station and get
some gas and some oil. All was good all the way to the
station. After I was done there I started off again.
After about 1/2 mile, I couldn't get it into second
gear. It would just grind and not go into gear. My
question is what might the problem be and what might
have caused it?
Thanks,
Tyler
