Subject: New engine won't start, 71 Westy, Help!
Message-ID: &lt;19991013223454.16950.rocketmail_at_web1005.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

Just installed a new Brazilian engine in my '71 Westy.
Won't start and we have traced the problem to a fuel
problem. The fuel pump is a new Bucar (VW of Mexico).
No fuel is getting to the pump. From the fuel pump
intake line back is clear because we blew air into it
and it went all the way back to the inline filter
(which is full of gas) under the bus. Wondering if the
pump rod is the problem. 

What is the problem?????

Thanks,
