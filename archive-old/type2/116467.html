Subject: FW: Latest Rage caught in San Diego fires

Taken from the vintagevw list. Lastest rage is in a few of the pics. Looks
like they lost a few trailers full of parts, but a Baja bug on top of a
container was spared
Subject: Latest Rage caught in San Diego fires



Gang,
Latest Rage may not be answering their phones for a while.  A friend sent
me these pix, link at bottom of this message (he works for Cox
Communications...these pix are from their work at a switch that was
affected by the fires in Alpine).  The &quot;Channelmatic&quot; building houses
Latest Rage.  You can see burned out trailers in the first picture, and in
the 5th row, far right 2 pictures. Looks like there might be VW rims in
that rubble.

My parents' house was spared, but houses within 1/8 mile in a few
directions around them burned down.

&gt;Hey guys, I thought you might like to see these pictures. Check out 
&gt;the damage at Latest Rage. I don't think they will be selling any of 
&gt;those plastic seats that were stored in those trailers. .
