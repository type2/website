Hi Jacques,

Start at the battery and work forward.

Make sure the connections at the battery + and - terminals are clean  
and tight. Then check the connection at the starter... that is the  
main terminal for all the big power wires. Make sure the wires there  
are tight and clean as well. While you are under the bus, check the  
ground strap on the transmission as well.

Once you have verified that there is power at the starter, make sure  
the thick black and red wire is clean and tight. It's the one that  
powers the fuse box. If that one is loose or corroded there won't be  
much going on up front at all.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; My '78 westy is acting up.  First the stereo power came and went,  
&gt; then one
&gt; afternoon she wouldn't start. Finally got it running and made it  
&gt; home.  I heard
&gt; a clicking like a circuit breaker under the dash. Turn signals were  
&gt; erratic.
&gt; Now I've got nothing.  No lights, no start, no joy.
