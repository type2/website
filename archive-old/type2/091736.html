Subject: Re: [T2] Using tire paint on worn out floor mats

Forget the black die, it is a lacquer product and unless the surface it
is to be applied to is squeaky clean it WILL come off.
Whereas Tire Black can be applied to almost any surface and is bullet
proof.
I have been using this stuff for years on the rubber floor mats in Mack
trucks , as well as the tires after I've painted the wheels.
It doesn't come off----
Its available at most any of your better  body shop supply store--- 


Later,

Terry

I would suggest vinyl die that you can source at any body shop supplier
(most towns have 5! &lt;grin&gt;). 
$7 - many colors. Comes in spray cans.

My floor mat is already ripped almost in half, and has a hole cut in it
for hi beam switch, and is brown, so I did some quick google searches,
and found some companies advertise their &quot;tire paint&quot; for restoring
floor mats, mud flaps etc. Until I get a nice new mat (low on the list),
I thought I might give it a shot. Anyone ever try this? If so where
might i go to get a smaller quantity?
