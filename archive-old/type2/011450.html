Subject: brakes?
Priority: normal
X-mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v3.12)


i have a 74 bus and
i have checked my pads, and the shoes on the drums and there is 
plenty there. We then bleed the brakes which made them respond 
somewhat quicker. Drums also recently adjusted.

Still you press down and starts to slow then foot falls little further 
and then some real braking. Why is it taking so long to respond 
through. What can i do to improve, shorten the distance you have 
to put your foot down before you get some real braking.

a friend(?) also broke off the nut when we were bledding the brakes 
so it will have to be drilled out as well so i am hoping i dont have to 
bleed again in the near future.

anyone help me out?
