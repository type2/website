&gt; How do you know this?   :-)
&gt; In my estimation,, they can not be too tight,, as they will be set at .006 &quot; 
&gt;  on
&gt; the base circle..... but,, they may not be .006&quot; at the &quot;ignition&quot; timing
&gt; mark...
&gt; all this means is the &quot;valve&quot; timing is a tiny bit advanced... in relation 
&gt; to
&gt; the ignition timing ,, but the clearance is still .006&quot; ....... correct?

I think you are correct jamie   I dont think steve has ever done a valve 
adjustment on a porsche 914   That is a major PITA and the only way I do them is 
by bumping the motor over till the valves come up  later  Mark Dearing
