John,

Tough question!  There are a LOT of 69 - 75 1700 and 1800cc cases out their 
that have been rebuilt to 2 liter specs.

Some late-1974 and 1975 bus 1800's did have fuel injection.

All of this info is from Tom Wilson's rebuild book.

carbed:
CB, CD bus engines 1700cc
AW bus engines 1800cc

fuel injected:
V, Z, W, EA, EB, EC type IV and porsche 914 1700cc
AW bus and EC, AN porsche 914 1800cc

fuel injected: (and most likely 2 liter even if rebuilt)
ED, GD, GE bus
GA, GB 914 engines (unique heads)
CV vanagon (unique case and heads)

The two letter codes appear on the top of the left case half running 
diagonally form the bell housing flange or on top of the right case half near 
the fan housing.

If you see a number on the fan housing, know that these are easily swapped.

You've got about 15 years worth of type IV engines to choose from.  Only the 
72 and later bus engines will have the right tin.  Fuel injection was 
available every one of those years.  I believe the early type IV systems are 
electronic, similar to the type III.  The later bus and 914 systems are whats 
called &quot;air flow control&quot;.
