X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

[...]

Some of us old fogies vividly recall the dire predictions of total
automotive catastrophe if unleaded fuel was made the law of the land.  Auto
magazines and columns in newspapers lamented the demise of the auto age, as
I.C. powered vehicles would cease to exist in any recognizable form.  Even
the Indy 500 would fade away, as their alky fueled engines would be so far
removed from unleaded fuel &quot;stock&quot; engines as to be irrelevant.

A new category of engine additives bloomed overnight, all expensive and most
utterly ineffective.  I still have a few bottles on the shelf.  I used to
carry a few in our bus in case we were FORCED to buy gas in California, in
the thin hope that the additive would allow me to nurse a struggling and
dying engine back to Oregon where I could drain off the unleaded fuel and
replace it with proper leaded regular.

The catastrophe didn't happen, they're still racing at Indy [and elsewhere],
and we've never had any sort of aircooled VW engine problem attributable to
unleaded fuel.  Some of the stuff the oil companies add to the unleaded
regular is detrimental to fuel lines, etc., but none of the valves and seats
we've autopsied show any ill effects.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I haven't seen leaded gas here in California in a very long time.  There
remain plenty of aircooled VWs however :)  &lt;&lt;
