Subject: Hanging Dog, NC this weekend!

The Cool Breeze VW club based in Cleveland, Tennessee is having their 
falling down drunk weekend at Hanging Dog campground on Hiawassee Lake 
in Murphy, NC.

Friday night is a fish fry ($5 for non-members) and Saturday night is 
a free BBQ.  GREAT food!

&quot;Mopwater&quot; drinking contest!  How long can YOU keep standing?

Organize your own posse and comb the woods for FBI's 10 most wanted 
bombing suspect Paul Rudolph and earn a million dollar bounty for his 
capture!

Sunday there is a VW show in Toccoa, GA which is about an hour southeast 
of Murphy, NC.

Hope to see some of you there at these events this weekend.

Dave
