Subject: Help on email (Eudora) VW..VW..VW..VW..VW

I'm new in this 'listserve' stuff...however I've been a BBS'er for lots of
years.  Started with a Commodore 64 (....oh my god...I'm getting
old)....anyway....Used to be, when you typed a message or long 'post' you
could type the thing up in your favorite 'editor' or Word Processing
software and the 'Send' that message with a heading.  (I'm not talking about
attaching a file).  In other words import or merge a text file into the main
body of my message.....

I use Eudora.  Does any other Email software do what I am asking?  I checked
Netscape 2.2's email options.  I haven't checked out the new 3.0 though.

Maybe even a 'fakeout' way of doing it....I like do'in that stuff!
