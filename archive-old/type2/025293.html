Subject: 71 or earlier passenger bus wanted in North Carolina area
From: Chris &lt;ncbus_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

I just noticed that I did not receive digest 347 and I wanted to make sure
that this was seen by everyone so here it goes again.

We are located in Greensboro, North Carolina and would like to buy a 1971 or
earlier passenger bus in good running condition. If you are in the
midatlantic or southeast and have a bus in this catagory that would like to
sell please contact me.

We also have a 1972 hardtop camper with a 1969 westy interior installed for
sale or trade. The '72 is a strong runner with 105k original miles. It is
not the prettiest bus but I have used it as a daily driver for the last
30000 miles and found it to be quite trustworthy. We would prefer to sell it
after a replacement bus had been found but if you have questions let me
know.
