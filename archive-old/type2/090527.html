Subject: Re: [T2] horn button removal

is this true in a 71 as well? of all the things that actually work on
this bus after it has been parked for almost 20 years, the horn,
unfortunately, does not. haven't gotten around to chasing down the wires
for it yet, but when i do, i will be removing the horn button as part of
the process.

thanks,
chris (TulsaVWChic)
71 westy ~ as yet unnamed

&gt; It's only held in by an attached metal clip going most of the way 
around.
&gt; Get a flat item in there, like a feeler gauge or finger nail and 
&gt; work your way around until it pops off.
