I once had an engine fire. The van had been standing turned off for over
half an hour,
When i noticed smoke pouring out the vents. I viewed this from inside an
apartment.
I ran out opened the hatch and put out the fire. An extra battery had lodged
positive
side against the metal.

My hatch was not locked!! What a pain if it had been. What if a bystander
had
tried to help. Can you see it now, where is the owner, where is his key?

Picture this...

You go out to start up your ultra clean '72 bus Monday morning and you hear
some VERY strange noises coming out of the engine bay.  You open the
compartment and find that the cute little kid that lives next door, the one
that was playing in the dirt all Sunday afternoon, has filled your engine
compartment with about 200 little toy buckets of dirt, including a couple of
dried up lizards and a dead squirrel!  I've kept my engine door locked ever
since, thank you.  ;-)
