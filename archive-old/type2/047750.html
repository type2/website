Subject: [T2] Simple Question

The dual carb motor is doing great.  I finally got the motor in and the bus 
home.   The question is this.  From the back of the bus the carb on the left 
has a vaccum line that comes out the top and sucks air.  Where does this 
vacuum go to? It is about 1/2 to 3/4 inch big.  Are there any major 
differences I should know about in reguards to the two motors side by side 
(FI AND Dual carb) in how they run, accelerate, etc..
Peace Out
