Hmmmm...NOW I remember why you're supposed to label wires when you take them off.

Got a question for you:

There are 3 plugs that look like fuel injector plugs, but are not. They are close together on the wiring harness and  color coded. One has a blue casing; one black; one brown. Anyone care to match colors and connections? This wiring harness has not been modified; it's from a '77 bus. I have two such harnesses and they're both the same.

Thermo time switch = ?
Auxiliary Air Regulator = ?
? = ?

I don't think the third plug is to the cold start valve; I think that one is beige like the injector plugs.

Thanks! Joe
