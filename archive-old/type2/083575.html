&gt; &gt;&gt;I heard that a bug generator is shorter  (also it's stamped 30

&gt; If it is a bug engine, then the generator will be the right one for the
motor and cause no problems. To find out what your engine is from look at
the code stamped on the base of the generator stand. Post that number to
the list and I am SURE someone can tell you definitively if it is a
beetle engine.

It's not the engine that matters here, but the tin.  With the way that
engines get swapped around and the prevelence of bugs in the aircooled
world, there are many buses that sport cases that were originally in bugs.

If the round tin just forward of the generator is slightly concave it is
bus tin.  If it's slightly convex it is bug tin.  The fan hub is also
different
