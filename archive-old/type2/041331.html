Hello list I am currently redoing my '78 Campmobile and I have a short
question.
I ordered a long block from AVP and starting to change over the rest of
the parts from old engine. This is a automatic and I need to know the
size of the 12 point bolts that hold on the plate to crankshaft. Is this
tool easy to find? Nobody in this area knows.

Thanks for the help...
Chris
