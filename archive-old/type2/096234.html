mine is also a daily driver and I have taken it from Baltimore to Maine,
New Hampshire and Vermont in winter several times..but I needed to make an
emergency business trip last week and couldn't get plane or train
reservations so with having just put new heads on my van I made the
painfull decision to rent a car.  (20 way power seat, and I could never
get as comfortable as my bus)

&gt; only ONE Type 2 on the road.  These trips were all made without any

didn't see many type 2's but last Sunday (21st) I saw several bays headed
east on New York route 17 between Binghamton and Elmira was there a get
together up that way???  found myself waving, but no one waved back and I
felt so alone on the road.

&gt; My advice is to do your mechanical best for your bus, then drive it! They
&gt; don't get any better while they're sitting in the driveway.

can't disagree with you there, would only add that join then take the AIRS
list with you
