Subject: buying a westy in Europe
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Volks,
  A guy I work with is looking at retiring here soon. He
wants to buy a westy in Europe and travel.
QUESTIONS:
1) where would be the best place to buy one? Germany?
2)Anyone have a contact for this guy to deal with
before he goes?
3) What does the Eurovan or 88-90 Van-O-Gone Westy
go for (in US dollars if you know the conversion rate)?
4) Insurance tips / concerns?
5) Is a US driver's license good everywhere over there?
6) Any other tips?.

  Pleas E-mail me direct unless you think it is worth
telling everyone about... dont want to plug the list up
here.8-O

  Thanks in advance!
