Subject: eccentric bushings

i asked a few days ago how to get the  ecc. bushings off of the upper ball 
joints. a few wrote back with the same suggestion-- a machine shop. 
i ran by a shop with the torsion arms in hand,  we went back to a 50 ton 
press, i held on to the arm and we supported under the bushing w/ shim stock 
and the press pushed on the ball joint arm.  when it finally let loose, the 
second one was at about 6 tons force (bent the shim stock) (we both did not 
look at the gauge on the first one but it was similar). i could never have 
gotten that loose w/ ANY hand tool, as i was told on this list.
once again, thank you all so much.  as soon as i have time and the weather 
breaks we are back on the road!
