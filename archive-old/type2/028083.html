&gt;Living in the midwest I have never heard of required full service pumping.
Why do they have this? It just sounds like one of those crazy old state
laws.

&quot;Back in the old days&quot; all gas stations pumped gas for you, cleaned
your windshield and checked oil - without asking first. Pumping your
own gas was created by the gas shortage of the mid-70's. This was
instituted to &quot;hold labor prices down&quot; so gas could be sold cheaper.
We now know better, don't we?

Frankly, I enjoy having my gas pumped for me, except when on my
Harley and I usually get handed the pump anyway. It rains here, a lot!
I get to stay warm and dry while some college student gets to earn a living.

Crazy? Gas companies have tried to change the law but citizens won't allow
it.
Its just us and New Jersey as far as I know.

Hey - we don't have sales tax either. Pretty nice to pay for something that
its
marked at. Sales tax...now that's crazy.

Sorry for off topic.

Pete
