Howdy campers!

I just got a bunch of advertising from America Online in my 
(snail) mailbox. Seems they're getting desperate and are upping 
their regular &quot;10 hours free&quot; gambit to &quot;50 hours free.&quot; But 
what caught my eye was the psychedelic Type 2 loaf featured as a 
graphic for their &quot;internet roadtrip&quot; on the menu screen.

I believe this constitutes further evidence that when America
(or at least American advertising designers) think, &quot;ROAD TRIP!&quot;
they still think, &quot;VW BUS!&quot; We all know that VW buses are the 
quintessential roadtrip vehicles, but I was a bit surprised to see
a tip of the hat from the mainstream media.

I won't be signing up with AOL anytime soon, but it is gratifying to 
see that many Americans still dream fondly of doing something I actually
do all the time, i.e. road trip in my beloved Westy. Often as not, I'm 
road tripping to go surfing, so in TWO ways I am still actually 
doing something wonderful that for many has come to mean simply
sitting in front of the terminal consuming electrons and pretending to have an 
adventure.

Don't dream it, be it!
