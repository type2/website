Now we are talking loopy beyond the envelope.




Sounds convincing doesn't it? When I first got on the web back in 1996/1997 I started reading about all these super efficient machines. Spent alot of time reading about them. Then it slowly, slowly dawned on me - it was all on paper but seldom in reality. Sort of like these folks are waiting for someone to e-mail them the final step to take their machine from the test bench to reality. I even joined a list about a Phillipines fellow that had invented a Camry that would run on water (or something like that) but he was a secretive fellow. Would not show his car to anyone... 

Anybody heard any more about the air cars? (run on compressed air!)

Supposedly they were going to have a factory in Europe and be producing these cars a couple years ago. THAT would be a neat device to power a bus with. Use the OEM VW engine and figure out a way to couple the air motor to it for hill climbing assistance. Plenty of run under the bus for long air tanks. Back to my air chair to do some more &quot;engineering&quot;.
