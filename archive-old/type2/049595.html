Is a good resource for checking on prices. There is a fabulous book here in
California called California Camping, and has all of the spots here in CA.
You might try looking for one of those in the states you are visiting. Also,
I would try looking at regular campgrounds, not RV places, unless you can't
live without the hookups. RV places are more expensive, and isn't part of
the point of owning a bus is the ability to camp *anywhere* for free?!

Cool,
cara

Hi Dan,

    Look under State Parks with camping grounds. Here in Lake Charles,
Louisiana, we have Sam Houston Jones State Park, $2.00 a car load. $5.00 for
overnight hook up. Eight miles north of I 10 and worth the trip.
