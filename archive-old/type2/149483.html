Subject: Re: [T2] Parcel Trays

&gt;&gt;The knee-busting myth is just a myth.
&gt;
&gt;Not a myth really, but a matter of degrees. So the cautious thing to do is 
&gt;to make sure it will break before your knees do.

Sorry I wasn't clear, I meant as far as rubbing/hitting your knees and shins 
on the parcel tray in normal non front end smashing usage.

Yes I agree - non parcel trays are safer, yet just marginally. I think in 
any good front end hit my legs are probably gone.
