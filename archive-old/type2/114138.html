Subject: Re: [T2] '78 &amp; '79 Deluxe Middle sliding windows

&gt;A tip from another list...If it's just flat automotive glass that you need to
&gt;have cut, find a glass shop that carries &quot;school bus&quot; glass. It's flat safety
&gt;glass that can be custom cut to your dimensions...reportedly fairly cheap,
&gt;too...YMMV, as always... ;-(

Or have regular glass cut and then tempered. Did all the flat glass on my 
bus in tinted glass for something between $100 and $200. Been a few years. 
They cut copies of my glass and sent it off to be tempered. 1 shop could do 
the jalouise windows, other did the big glass. 2nd shop claimed they 
couldn't do narrow glass.

Commercial glass shops are the source I used.
