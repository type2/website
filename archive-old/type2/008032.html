Hi list...
Anyone know of a good junkyard that would sell relatively rust free used
body replacement parts and ship them to Pittsburgh? Things like the lower
slider door channel / rocker panel and that roller on the bottom of the
slider door ? If you've had some experience with this sort of thing, let me
know. BTW, I tried that &quot;bus heaven&quot; and they sort of left me hangin' so I
thuoght I'd ask you nice folks....I'm a busser in need. TIA.
Mark
