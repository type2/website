Anyone wanna make me feel better, by admitting that they, too, have been
totally clueless about their bus at one time?

In a short trip today, the bus went from OK, to the point where I couldn't
get it into gear at the lights, EVENTUALLY, it got locked into reverse &amp; I
ended up calling roadside assistance, CERTAIN that I was up for a long tow &amp;
new transaxle. I got underneath, but was stumped by the plate covering the
gear selector (more later on this).

When the guy turned up, we rocked it out of gear in about 10 seconds, and he
followed me over to my house (I'd almost made it myself, just a few more
KM). His suggestion was that the clutch needed looking at (as well as the
gear selector that I was fixating on), which made sense when I FINALLY
stopped to think, as I could select gear with the engine off, but not with
the engine running, and the bus stalled when stopped in gear (clutch
dragging).

After trying to find the manual &amp; spare clutch cable in the van (show's how
long it's been since I've used them, but in my defence, I didn't get to use
her for about 18 months after a break-up), I asked my builder friend (who's
working on my house and has been a bus only driver for 30 odd years), where
the clutch adjustment was, he showed me where it was, put 4-5 turns on the
adjuster, and it was fine after that.

So, to stop me slashing my wrists and/or selling the bus to someone who DOES
have a clue, anyone else want to admit to having been this clueless at some
point in their bus ownership? Knowing that there's some chance of redemption
would be nice :o(
