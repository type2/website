Hiya Robert,

Concerning the Pastel White and the Kansas Beige.............  I'd think your 
best bet would be to contact a auto paint distribution point.  I know that 
our local supplier of auto paint can mix small batches for such purposes.
The Black-grey (L43) you need is available in spray cans from Wolfsberg West. 
 I don't believe that it is in their catalog - you'll have to ask for it.  
Come to think of it now, I do believe that they have a limited selection of 
other VW colors in spray cans also.  You might check WW for your other two 
colors also.

Mike
