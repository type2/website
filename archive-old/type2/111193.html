&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; I would be interested in hearing from anyone who was using a Solex Pict 34 -3
&gt; on a 1600 DP and downsized to a Brosol 30/31 -3 using their adapter flange.
&gt; I was wondering if you experienced any impacts on performance , gas mileage or unplanned mechanical issues after the downsizing.

I made the switch with good results.  Unfortunately, I put the new carb on
a new low-comprssion Mexican engine, so I can't tell you whether the small
power loss is due to the compression or carb.  My gut feeling is that the
carb is not responsible.

The best thing is that this carb worked great out of the box and has given
_no_ problems.  Always starts right off, idles nicely, etc.
