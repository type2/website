&gt; &gt;  1) How much time is too much time to spend
&gt; &gt; working on a vehicle that has already had everything rebuilt, and runs well?
&gt; 
&gt; can you ever spend enough time?

when he starts sleeping in the bus instead of in a nice warm bed with
you then its time to seek help, until then everything else is normal.
 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) Is it manditory to &quot;tweak&quot; things on a regular basis?
&gt; 
&gt; you betcha!
if it only runs good maybe if you keep fooling with it you'll get it to
run great..
 
&gt; &gt; 3) How many
&gt; &gt; accessorys does a Delux ' 78 Westphalia camper need, anyway?
&gt; 
&gt; It needs more.

oh yes, i love my duel batteries (i need to find a use for the second
one yet) right now it just helps out a bit with starting..
 
&gt; &gt; And the Big One:
&gt; &gt; Is my husband the only one who looks at his westy and gets &quot;excited&quot;( I've
&gt; &gt; seen him actually running his hands over the bus and drooling...Strange, at
&gt; &gt; least in my book...)
&gt; 
&gt; What book is that?  He was just bonding with the bus.  Keeping it calm, admiring
&gt; its great shine and beautiful texture.  When you're nice to your bus, your bus is
&gt; nice to you.

buses like love and attention, the more attention you give them the
better they run (usualy)
 
&gt; &gt; ( whos husband mumbled something about &quot;wheel Bearings&quot; this
&gt; &gt; morning and wandered off into the garage 2 hours ago...)
&gt; 
&gt; I should really do mine too ;)

i had mine done a few months back, well, the front one's i should
probably do the back.

give your husband a &quot;she left me because of this car&quot; bumper sticker in
good humor.
