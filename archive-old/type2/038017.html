I took my engine out to change the fuel tank and in the process found out
that the guy I bought the bus off of, when he put a new clutch in, didn't
bother bolting the transmission back up.  Therefore my bus (1972) engine was
only supported by the one bracket near the back.  As can be imagined, my
engine rocked quite  bit, which I was concerned about.  However, after
getting everything put back together, correctly, my engine doesn't rock at
all, I'm wondering if it's supposed to?  I don't know too much about the
type IV engines, it's the first time I've dealt with anything but a Type I
and a Type II engine?
