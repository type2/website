Thanks to everyone who was so kind to offer up their experiences and
suggestions for removing the top on a Dormi.  I appreciate it.  The common
one was 'let the air out of the tires' - which ended up being the final task
that had to be performed after the removal of the top (that, along with my
own body weight in the cab!) that got her under the door and in for the
winter!  Had, at the most, the thickness of a bottle cap to spare.
And just in time...last weekend, took the top off in a t-shirt; this weekend
it's snowing!
So she is in and topless.  You will be hearing more from me as this project
progresses.  And thanks do all the other dormi owners out there who just
wanted to say 'hi' and 'good luck'.

thanks again for everyone's help!

James
