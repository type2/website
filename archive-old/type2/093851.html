Subject: Re: [T2] Turn signal

Hiya Jim,

The turn signal switch for a 70 Bus is real bear.  I know - I've gone through 
about six of them.  Do know this, you can fix your problem with a new one.  
RMMW has them for $139 and most FLAPS can get them for around $80.  If that 
sounds a little expensive (and it certainly did to me)  you might try 
collecting some old ones and build a good switch out of the old parts (which 
is what I did).

Your basic problem is that your return springs (2 of 'em) are shot.  These 
are going to be very hard to replace.  I've been through a bunch of small 
springs lately (other projects) and I don't know where you'll find these 
things other than in another switch.  And they HAVE to be replaced.  Once you 
have your switch out you can examine it and see what I'm referring to.  It's 
a complicated little bugger but it can be renewed.  Geez, if I did it, most 
anybody could.
