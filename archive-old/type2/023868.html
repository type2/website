Subject: 70 Bus at local junkyard

Hey folks,

Last weekend I saw a 1970 Bus at a local junkyard.  Both bumpers were there
and in pretty good shape - little bit of surface rust, but straight.  Also,
passenger seat looked nice - brown vinyl lowback.

Engine and tranny are gone.  I'm heading back there tomorrow.  If anyone
wants anything, please drop me a line with what you need.  They are very
reasonable with prices, but just in case, let me know what you want to
spend.

Please let me know within the next few hours.

Thanx!

Z

The trannies have different &quot;rib&quot; sizes and numbers.  The different years
had different gear ratios.  68-71? have three large ribs, 72-74? have five
smaller ribs that have are cut on a 45 degree angle where the top changes
to the side of the tranny, 75-79 have 5 ribs with no angle cut.


&gt;Is the tranny thats used in the 68-71 bus and the 72-79 the same ? If not,
&gt;how can you tell them apart? I know the later tranny is a two piece. I have
&gt;a friend with a mid 70's bus, so we are wondering if the 68-71 tranny would
&gt;work.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;David
