Hey Randall,
I don't know who wrote that article that you quoted, but it sounds kinda
hokey to me.  I also don't know what they mean by the #3 retard cam and
meltdown and all that jazz, but I could just be spacey :)

I had the same problem as you.  When I got my engine, the wires were
reversed on my dizzy cap and it confused me at first.  Later I found out
that whoever rebuilt the dizzy put the drive dog on 180 degrees off. 
Steve Dolan was able to get the pin out easily (under the retaining
spring), but I had to use a hydraulic press to get mine out.  If you
aren't very mechanically savvy, I wouldn't mess with ANYTHING! including
the gear.  According the list, if you mess up, you can drop  parts into
your crank and then you'll really be hating life.

I would either pull out your dizzy and take off the drive dog and spin
it 180 degrees and put it back on or just deal with the crossed wires. 
Here's the reversed order that you should have:

1 4 
2 3 

instead of the normal:

3 2
4 1

double check my numbers here making sure you have the correct firing
order.  I believe it's 1-4-3-2.. I don't have my book in front of me. 
(SOMEONE CORRECT ME IF i'M WRONG HERE!)

It's no big deal.. Just cosmetic.  Just put the dizzy back in just like
it was normal, except for the wierd wires.  The diaphram shouldn't have
any clearance problems either.  I wouldn't wrack your brain over this
one!

later,
Mike

&gt; Greetings List,
&gt; Yesterday I asked which distributor worked best for fuel injection and
&gt; everybody said the stock vacuum.  Last night I sifted through my spare parts
&gt; and found a vacuum dizzy, cleaned it up, and proceeded to install it.  I
&gt; quickly learned my distributor gear shaft was installed approximately 180
&gt; degrees out so I simply switched the wires around and fired Kermit the Bus
&gt; right up. (he still didn't run worth a damn, but I'll keep wrenching until
&gt; he does)  Prior to posting this I read the archives and found this message
&gt; which I have quoted below.
&gt; 24: Some distributors do not have the #3 retard cam, and so it
&gt; 25: is a moot point on these. It is poor craftsmanship to install it wrong,
&gt; 26: but not fatal.
&gt; 28: Muir is right. If you install the drive gear wrong, it is not fatal.
&gt; Even
&gt; 29: if you have an older VW engine where the #3 retard is important, you
&gt; will
&gt; 30: be alright, as long as the #1 wire and notch align. If you can get the
&gt; 31: vacuum diaphram housing to clear everything, too.
&gt; My question is ......Do I need to be concerned about the #3 retard cam on a
&gt; 1978 (or so) model vacuum distributor?  Did these distributors even have a
&gt; cam and how can I tell?  I have the part number, but it's not handy.  I know
&gt; the first three numbers were 022 and the last letter was an S.  The wires
&gt; are switched around so the #3 cylinder is in the #1 spot on the distributor
&gt; now.  Will #3 have a complete meltdown because of this?  Do I need to turn
&gt; the gear around or can I avoid this?  I understand its an easy but very
&gt; risky task to rotate the gear itself.  Thanks for your help.  I'm new to the
&gt; list and amazed at the knowledge and expertise available here.
