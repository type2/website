Hi All!

Before I start, let me state clearly that I do NOT want to start up the 
argument over what kind of paint, primer, etc, is the best!

What I'm interested in is painting my bus in some sort of psychedelic paint 
scheme. Has anyone got some advice on painting your own bus? I'm sure 
renting a paint booth and spray gun would be the 'best' route but it sounds 
expensive. I do want a good paint job but I'd like to do it on the cheap!

TIA

And what is not good---
Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
