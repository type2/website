Subject: Somewhat silly question..

My 1973 camper is currently at the previous owners house, a couple hundred
miles from me.  A friend of mine is offering a space in his barn for me to
keep it closer/work on it/etc..
However, he needs to know the approximate height in order to figure out
which &quot;bay&quot; of the barn to put it in.  Since I'm not near my camper, and I
don't have my bentley, or any other manuals with me..could someone give me
an approxmate measure of how tall a 73 camper is (with the top closed)?
Thanks in advance
--Nick
