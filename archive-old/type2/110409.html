Hiya,

    While taking apart a donor engine I noticed that it had a leak like this.
You'll need to check the cam plug there. This engine was a GEX and when 
assembled they apparently did'nt use any sealent. That kind of leak will just pour 
into the bell houseing but pretty much stay away from the clutch.
