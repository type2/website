Subject: Couple of Wiring Q's

Hey guys,

      I have a couple of wiring questions:

1 - Where does the rear defog wiring go? Is the wiring inside the cabin? Or does it run along the underneath of the car with the main harness?


2 - I have three wires that come from the main harness to the engine compartment of my Bus. These three wires I have determined (looking at the Bentley) that it is for the heater fan. Does this get used for anything else? Or can I simply wrap up the ends and tie it out of the way? 


3 - What purpose does the 4th gear vacuum advance cut-off solenoid serve for the distributor? Why would the distributor want the vacuum advance to be cut off in the upper rpms? 



Thanks!

Todd
