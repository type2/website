No.

&gt; If so, that would mean the master
&gt; mixture adjustment only adjusts one carb. I can't find a schematic of
&gt; the internal carb fuel circuits, but I thought it only served to allow
&gt; air into the crossover air tubes, which would affect mixture at all
&gt; RPM's, though it might be an insignificant amount of air bled into the
&gt; manifolds at speeds above idle.

The air and fuel at idle is metered by two separate screws and the mixtures
goes to a distributor behind the air filter and then directly into the
manifolds.
