Subject: Re: [T2] How many 34PICT-3 designs are there?

Hi Richard,

According to Dennis Jolliffe, my local Solex Expert, there are 
differences in each year of German carbs, and they are different from 
the Brazilian models as well. Not only did each carb change from 1972, 
73 and 74 model years, but there was also a different design for 
automatic as compared to the manual trannies. Dennis has quite a few of 
these, and has found a local shop that will press new bushings into the 
throttle bodies.

One afternoon last summer Dennis showed me 4 different variations on 
the right hand (1-2 side) carb, and I have no reason to doubt that 
there are more out there. The left carb seems to be a bit more 
standardized.

The gaskets in the rebuild kits are often missing holes for passages, 
and have holes for passages that aren't there, until you look at one of 
the other carbs.

Fuel injection is a picnic in comparison. Once you get it running, that 
is.

NOTE:
For those on the list who know Dennis, you'll be pleased to know that 
he is doing well recuperating from a recent valve job on his own 
personal oil pump last week. The Doctors say he'll be as good as ever 
once he recuperates. It'll be time for Everybus before he's allowed to 
drive again though.


Happy trails,

&gt; Wow!!
&gt; I agree with David, I have seen a number of slight variations, I even 
&gt; have one from Brazil which is very different.
&gt; I too have never seen that adjustment before, so not certain how to 
&gt; adjust it. What that diaphragm does is to open the choke up slightly 
&gt; if you drive off when still cold. The normal non adjustable ones do 
&gt; have a stop cast into the cover in the picture. My guess would be to 
&gt; adjust yours to the same length as the non adjustable one. It's 
&gt; function will not affect normal running, so I can't see the adjustment 
&gt; being critical.
