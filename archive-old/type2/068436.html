Subject: Re: Content (or lack thereof)...PLEASE READ!

Thanks to everybody who replied to my content message. I got a fair number
of replies and read all of them several times, all of them were helpful. I
want to publicly commend Tobin Copley and Ron Salmon who both sit above the
salt; these gentlemen sent detailed replies that had obviously had a great
deal of thought put into them. Ron in particular disagreed with me
strenuously and gave me buckets of excellent reasoning to back up his
points, which is exactly what I was looking for.

I seem to have been unclear on one point: many people are under the
impression that the subscriber and message/day limits I proposed were
permanently imposed by the server I want to move to; I got several comments
about a &quot;zero-growth&quot; list (both pro and con!). None of the proposed limits
are set in stone, and the server boasts of its ability to carry lists of up
to 100,000 subscribers--*they* can do a list as big as I want, the question
lies with me.

Most people argued against a limit on the number of subscribers, and
several did it very persuasively:

&gt;With the tremendous growth of
&gt;the internet, you will very quickly find yourself in a position of having
&gt;to close subscriber membership to dozens, eventually hundreds, of genuinely
&gt;interested bus owners.  This will be to the deteriment of the entire list,
&gt;as some of the people who are denied subscription may have a wealth of
&gt;knowledge and information.

It was also pointed out that the number of people who receive the list and
the number of people who post fluff to the list are not the same thing at
all; these are independent of each other.

This is conceded. I've been convinced that a limit on the number of
subscribers is not a good idea, and we won't do that.

Fewer people had problems with the prospect of limited message slots, and
those who did had weaker arguments; the most convincing arguments held that
if I did this, eventually I was going to have to censor for content and
that was going to cause resentment. The most incisive writers pointed out
that censoring for content was precisely what I had said I wished to avoid
in the first place--I didn't want to be the Hall Monitor.

But as nasty as I might find it, I already do that to a degree and if I
have to do more of it I will. We're going to go ahead and limit the message
slots. It won't be oppressively low and it can be raised if the
signal-to-noise ratio justifies that--but it has to justify that first. The
content guidelines will be made more clear.

Many people asserted that the list is fine as it is and they didn't see why
I should fix a thing that ain't broke; it's obviously very popular and
growing like a weed and it's oodles of fun. This needs addressing and if
you get nothing else out of this message, get this:

I thought, too, that the fact that the list grew like it did proved that it
must be a good resource; it's a lot of work to go through all this mail and
if it weren't worth it people would leave as fast as they came.

This was an error. It was the sort of fundamental error one makes casually
and with the best of intentions and a lot of people end up the worse for
it.

Because it turns out that there is a huge demand for a highly popular list
that is ostensibly about busses but is actually a very slow IRC chat
session devoted to the amusement of the listees. It's all &quot;about&quot; busses in
some vague, attenuated way but with a wink and a nudge there's really
nothing that isn't topical.

If I have to choose, I don't want to run a popular list, I want to run a
good one. The list is, too, broke. It's about 50% dreck on days *other*
than Friday.

Lighten up, Hoop: There was just as much joshing around, by weight, even in
the old days of v_at_l and it's been pretty constant ever since. It's not a
&quot;somebody&quot; problem, it's an &quot;everybody&quot; problem. We all cut up sometimes
(me among the worst, no denying). Well, except the UK contingent, who never
ever waste bandwidth, so we will not blame them twice over. ;)

But we can't keep up with everybody doing it sometimes with this many
people, because those sometimes are beginning to mean 40 messages per day
and it's just too much. Yes, if we limited the number of subscribers we
would deny ourselves the company of people with &quot;a wealth of knowledge and
information&quot;. But how many are we driving off now because they have better,
more mechanical things to do than read mountains of irrelevant blather?

Last (I know this is too long already), I alarmed a great many of you when
I said, &quot;this list is not a social institution.&quot; One averred that it was
too a social institution and that was what he was here for in the first
place; a few agreed that it was not and it was high time somebody said it;
most were concerned that I was out to sterilize the &quot;character&quot; and the
&quot;human element&quot; of the list.

Look. We are the VW bus freaks. We are the last people on this entire Earth
who ought to have a grim, regimented mailing list. That's not what I meant.
Sheez, if *we* aren't going to have fun, then who is?

I never would have taken this on if I hadn't known who I'd be dealing with,
and truly this is by far the finest bunch of people I've ever worked with
on line. Be who you are. I'm only taking out after twaddle, not character;
there's a difference.

Pending the server switch (still negotiating, but soon) I'm gonna change
the info file (what passes for a charter). I'll post the changes tomorrow,
not the whole info file, and thereafter I'll post the entire file every
Thursday night. I hope you'll pay attention to it. I have never yet had to
cancel anybody's subscription for provocation and it will sadden me if I
have to start now.

There exists the possibility that, eventually, the signal-to-noise ratio
may be high but the list will still be too big to be readable by anybody
but weenies. I'm pegging this somewhat arbitrarily at 600 subscribers, 100
msgs/day. If/when this happens I may split it into type2-tech (hardware)
and transporter-soc (soft goods).
