Subject: Re: [T2] heater air blower

When dealing with the heater blower circuit, it is important to know what
circuit configuration,, as it changed about '75
It is easy to tell what the factory wiring was if your dash is still
original...
If your dash does NOT say TEMP MAX beside the lever, then the relay does
not need the alternator to make voltage, and the fan will come on with or
without the engine running. I think that change was made in '75
This circuit does not use the blue wire.

The early T4 bays use the blue wire, the late bays do not,,
the early [72-74] use the blue wire
But, the wiring can be altered easily so the relay gets it's power from
the blue wire or not,,,

The blue wire is the charge light circuit for the alternator,, if the
alternator is making voltage [~8v] and the lever is in the Temp MAX
position, then the relay should pull in, allowing current from the battery
thru the fuse, relay contacts, to the fan motor, to ground.

Check you have ground at your fan motor,, they are rubber mounted

you can hot wire the connections without any trouble,,

attach an aligator test jumper lead to the Bat+ pos terminal, and to the
&quot;A&quot; terminal on the relay, the Blue wire.
The fan should run now, without the engine running.
You have just simulated the output of the alternator at the blue wire

Use a test light , and see if you have power at term &quot;M&quot; the red wire at
the relay
if not, check the fuse and connections

Use a test light , and see if you have power at term &quot;B&quot; or &quot;J&quot; the yellow
black wire at the relay
if not, check the connections, or replace the relay
