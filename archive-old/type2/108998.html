&gt; I backed off--just couldn't see eating a ribbon of a 10.00 x 20 cap at 80.

On the way south-bound to college back in `74 we had a peace of cap smack
our vehicle.  We heard the cap pop and almost immediately heard and felt the
impact.

The interesting thing was that the tractor trailer that lost the cap was on
the other side of the divided interstate traveling north-bound, and that the
piece of cap traveled from the far north-bound lane, across the other two
north-bound lanes, across the grass median, across the two south-bound lanes
on our side of the interstate, and THEN hit our vehicle traveling in the
remaining south-bound lane, the piece of cap remaining airborne during it's
entire trajectory.

Very impressive.  I'd hate to think what that piece of cap would have done
had we been along side of the tractor trailer.  (Makes one appreciate the US
ban on hitchhiking/bicycling on interstates.)  After that experience, I
usually choose to avoid driving close behind or right along side of tractor
trailers.

My concern with our bay would be that lovely wide windshield and the open
windows.
