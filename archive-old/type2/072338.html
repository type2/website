&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I found a nice little pool of water on my rear deck after another Seattle
&gt;rain.  The rear hatch seal is old, hardened, etc.  I found another (used)
&gt;seal at Bry's and got it out of the wreck intact.  The price for a new seal
&gt;is beyond my means right now.

Make sure the rear window rubber is OK.  I replaced my rear hatch 
seal due to water inside, and it still leaks - this with a $$ German 
seal.  I discovered it's the seal for the rear glass.  It's leaking 
down inside the door thence to the deck.

&gt;
&gt;I checked the archives and there didn't seem to be any 'generally
&gt;recommended' product or method for revitalizing the seal.  I wondered if
&gt;anyone head any profound successes at this.  The best advice I found was
&gt;coating it in a thin layer of silicone.  Any particular brand or type that
&gt;works best?

There's some stuff called Zymol.  I bought some but have never tried 
it.  I think it's glycerin based.

&gt;
&gt;Also, what do you recommend as far as glue to hold it to the frame channel?

3M weatherstrip adhesive.

&gt;Thanks in advance!
