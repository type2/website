Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable just broke... Need help

I had my clutch replaced a few months ago.  Is this something I  need to check/replace, or should I just wait until I have a  problem.  Thanks....KR

Since I just did this on my 78.....

The rubber boot seals to keep stuff out of the cable tube.

Also, once I pulled mine out, It took me a few minutes to figure out where 
the tube actually was, up at the front after I fed it back thru the 
frame.  And since my clevis pin was worn, it took more than a few minutes 
to work it out of the cable and pedal arm without destroying it....I 
didn't have a spare at the time.

Sure works better now!

Cheers, dave
