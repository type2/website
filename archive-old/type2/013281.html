I've got a Coleman Mach II full size roof RV unit for $200.00 if anyone
needs it.
Requires a 14x14&quot; roof opening. It has a good reinforced cover and blows
really cold. Requires 110v and 15AMPS. It will not work on the Westy
popup incline but would work mounted in luggage rack or other flat area
if you're willing to build a custom sheet metal cover to enhanse the
appearance.
