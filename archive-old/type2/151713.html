Subject: Re: [T2] Q about inspecting a new engine after assembly

Don,

You *need* the dial indicator.  The use of feeler gauges requires a bolt 
on &quot;arm&quot; as a fixed point somewhere really close to the flywheel.

Dial indicator is the only way to fly....just be sure and &quot;flex&quot; the 
flywheel outward gently with two big screwdrivers before mounting the dial 
indicator....then tap it in gently with a rubber hammer to see your 
endplay....and don't set it too tight in the winter cold!!!!!!!!!

Depending on what kind of a sand seal you have, you could probably use a 
scat pulley....std size to use with a sand seal and with marks.  Probably 
not much weight difference over stock....

spray bbq paint is perfect, *but* once again, **mist** it ....you should 
still be able to almost see bare aluminum thu it.

Don, unless I missed something really big on the flash, it will be 
fine...more surface area to carry heat away....


If the pushrods *really* touch now, they will also touch later.
What kind of push rods?   chrome molly or HD aluminum?  Different valve 
adjustments to use for each kind.  Some &quot;thicker&quot; than others...look on 
aircooled_dot_net and read about the differences.  aluminum at standard 
clearance, chrome molly at zero clearance.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Thanks Dave.
&gt; 
&gt; Flywheel endplay is getting done. How do you get feelers back there?
&gt; I'd hate to have to find a dial indicator (though I should get one
&gt; anyway...)
&gt; 
&gt; Pulley still needs to be purchased. Any stock weight degreed pulleys
&gt; out there? My quick search just turned up lightened ones...
&gt; 
 In the valve train everything looks ok except the pushrods appear to
 be rubbing on the tubes. Does that straighten out during running? Or
 is it normal?
 
 I still need the hoses and filter mount for the full flow.
 
 Haven't started fitting tin yet. Waiting for the other bits like a pulley.
 
 The flash is ok? I'll try the paint. I was actually considering VERY
 thinned out bbq paint from a spray bottle. I know it's good for
 watercooled engines and figured it would be worthwhile to color the
 heads and cyls on my ACVW engine too.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to double check ALL the bolts that are accessible with the
&gt; engine assembled. Including (especially!) the head nuts.
