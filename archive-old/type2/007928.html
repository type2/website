Hi List,
I thank you all for the info. relating to the after market fuel pump
wiring...... Thanks so much.  Now, to the issue at hand.....
Since installing my new AVP eng. my alternator light has been flickering
for a few days.  (now you must note that I installed a newer,
and what I thought to better,  alternator.) Well, today on my way home from
work, lights got real dim, engine got a little jerky from what seemed like
lack of fuel, and then when I did get home and I turned the key off and
removed the key, the alternator light stayed on.  This seemed very odd.  So
I tried to start the ol' bus again and the alt. light went off (when it
should be on) and there was no response from the starter at all, but the
fuel pump did turn on with the key.  hmmmmmm. Any insight on this goofy
phenomenon??
Thanks in advance!!

p.s. on a hunch..... How hard is an alternator r &amp; r????
                          (please be gentle...)
