Subject: Trouble starting hot engine

Recently, we've been having some problems starting our '71 camper
after it'd been run for a while.  The problem manifested itself
after the engine had been run a long time (hence was good and
hot), then stopped for 5-15 minutes (hence had not had a chance
to cool down much).  

One could start it right up, run it for about a minute, then it'd 
die.  Subsequent attempts to start it were difficult at best...
then, once started and rolling, it would run fine.  

My theory was that when stopped with the engine off, engine 
heat had nowhere to go but into the engine compartment.  I
checked the engine, and I noticed a bubble in the fuel filter;
sometimes, the filter had more air than fuel in it.  There was 
also a minute bit of seepage from the fuel lines, just enough 
to make your fingers smell like gas if you sqeezed the braided
fabric fuel line.  

I replaced the fuel lines leading from the fuel pump to the 
filter, and from the filter to the carburetor, and I guess 
things are fine.  However, the weather's been a bit cooler 
since I've done this, so I can't say for sure if my repair has
been effective.  

Anyone else see this?  If so, are there any other trouble spots
I should examine?  One thought I had was that the engine might 
be running a little hot.  One thing I've never been able to 
figure out is how to determine engine temp - I suppose you can 
tell if the thermostat is opening the vents, but how to 
determine that the thermostat is opening at the correct temps?

I'd appreciate it if someone might have some advice here...

TIA...
