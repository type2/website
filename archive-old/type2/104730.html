&gt; I talked with Boston Bob extensively just the other night.  He knows his 
&gt; stuff and he's fun to talk to.  But, he said he will not bother to build an 
&gt; engine smaller than 2000cc and suggested that I get a transmission, fuel 
&gt; tank, and motor out of a late bay, install the transmission and gas tank and 
&gt; send in the motor for a core to him.  His engines start at $2000.  I'm not 
&gt; saying that this is not worth it - I'm still batting around going that route 
&gt; myself, but it may be too much work for what you want.  I'm leaning toward a 
&gt; smaller engine and doing it myself right now.

the $2000 is pretty good price, I rebuilt my 2liter pretty much stock,
with a VW trained machinist friend doing the bottom end and me doing the
top end. and I figured out I put just over $2,500 into it.
