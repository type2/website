&gt; I only stepped in cause' Ron said he could only offer 3 at that price. I can
&gt; get as many as needed.

&gt; I try to tread lightly.

Hey, the way I see it, the initial mention of swaybar deals on the list was a 
ONE-KIT-ONLY available at a discounted price from Ronnie at Old Volks of 
Arizona.  He apparently got swamped with responses so a few other vendors 
stepped in and presented generous offers to the list.

Nobody tried to undercut anybody or steal their sales.  All the deals were 
essentially the same (except for Ronnie's original one-kit-only which would 
have been about $25 cheaper).  I applaud all 3 vendors for trying to meet the 
needs of their fellow listees and save us a few bucks.

Look at it this way:  If the corner gas station lowers their price to 
$1.25/gallon, I EXPECT the guy across the street to lower his as well.  If he 
doesn't, in my book he becomes a rotten, greedy, thieving SOB and I don't buy 
gas from him.

'nuff said.
