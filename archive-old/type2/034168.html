Subject: Re: 1971 bus retrofit

RMW,

If I remember correctly, the 71 westy I used to have had a roof opening that 
looked suspiciously like it was originally built as a sunroof bus.  I have 
since &quot;upgraded&quot; to a 74 westy to get the better engine and a true bed up 
above that could sleep two.  

My 74 does NOT have the same style of roof hole as the 71.  It appears that 
the 74 began life with a regular roof, of which most of the back half was 
later removed to create the larger &quot;upstairs&quot;.  

Nothing is impossible, but you would certainly be looking at a MAJOR project 
to transplant all of what my 74 has up top to a 71, even if it was a 
westphalia.  I am, of course only basing my observations on the two vehicles 
that I have owned.  There seem to be a number of  different &quot;pop tops&quot; out 
there.

I don't want to rehash what seems to be a perennial &quot;best&quot; bus debate, so I 
will state that FOR ME, the move to a 74 was well worth it.  The 1800 engine 
is a vast improvement, the top seems to work better and I love the double bed 
up above.  I yanked the sink/cupboard from behind the drivers seat for weight 
reasons and put a single seat in its place with storage underneath.  I would 
be very hesitant to invest too much time in a retrofit when there seem to be 
a lot of good 74 and up westys around to start with.

Its a nice vehicle.
