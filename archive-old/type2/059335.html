Subject: BUS screen saver

This is where I got my background:  http://www.vanagon_dot_com/fun/theme/
and my screen saver is flying busses, sorta like flying windows or
starfield, but they're busses... I don't remember where I got it, but if
you want a copy, just email and i'll send it to you.  It was freeware off
of some bus related site.  Talk to you later,  Dallas
