More than you ever wanted to know about machine lubricants can be found
here http://theoildrop.server101_dot_com/ubb/ultimatebb.php

What's interesting to note is that the majority of greases out there,
especially the stuff you just go to the store to buy, are lithium
complex based. This base is good, but not the best for resistance to
water and wash-out.
