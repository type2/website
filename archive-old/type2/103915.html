Subject: Type 2 = Truck??

  Hi.

  How can I show or prove that the VW Type 2 is constructed on a truck 
chassis??

  The following quote from the Virginia code is the instigator:

  &quot;Multipurpose passenger vehicle&quot; means any motor vehicle that is (i) 
designed to carry no more than ten persons and (ii) constructed either on a 
truck chassis or with special
  features for occasional off-road use; &quot;

  If my '78 Westy is a &quot;Multipurpose passenger vehicle&quot;, I can get a few 
more exceptions under the Virginia code.

  Thanks

  Barry sends
