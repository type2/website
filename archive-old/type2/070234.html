Subject: (F) Signing Off till I can Catch Up

Hiddly Ho VW Folks:

The press of work and the fact that I have 2 VW engines to work on force me
to sign off for about 2 weeks. By then, I intend to be out of the 71 Ford
P/U and back into my Bus or Thing, hopefully both. I will update all of you
who graciously offered me advice when my bus engine ate a valve, burned two
pistons, and did some lower end damage I have yet to assess. It was an
expensive trip!

Thanks,
Skip Correll
