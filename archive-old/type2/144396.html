&gt; &gt; Some type 4 distributors had way too much advance for a type 1 engine.

I also wonder if the &quot;30 degree total advance&quot; number is also a bit
suspect.

I seem to recall someone making the point that you want to have 30 degrees
total advance under maximum load conditions, but that the
acceptable advance might be greater at partial throttle conditions.  I
think that this was touted as an advantage of the SVDA distributors.  It
allows a greater advance for greater fuel economy at partial throttle, the
retards a bit at WOT conditions to give the needed 30 degrees advance.

With a purely mechanical distributor, 30 degrees is a no-brainer.  You
simply rev the engine until the advance kicks in fully, then check for 30
degrees.

With an SVDA, it gets complicated.  The vacuum signal give a combination
of throttle plate position and total vacuum.  At zero throttle, the vacuum
signal will be low, as the vacuum port is upstream of the throttle
butterfly.  As the butterfly is opened, the vacuum signal grows, since
the velocity by the vacuum port will be high.  I would
expect (but I'm not sure) that the vacuum signal would then decrease as
the throttle is opened fully, as the air velocity past the port will
decrease as the open inlet area at the  butterfly is increased.

This is all theory until I actually put a vacuum guage on the line.

It would seem to me that if the SVDA is holding 30 degrees under load, it
would probably advance more than 30 degrees when you rev the engine to
check the timing with no load on the engine.  If this is the case, then
the engine will actually have less than 30 degrees under real full-load
conditions.

Does anyone actually know the correct procedure.  I'm not ready to buy a
chassis dyno to adjust my timing!  :)
