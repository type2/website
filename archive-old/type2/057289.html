Subject: 80 Vanagon engine in '71?

So, it's like this: 

I have an '80 Westfalia....good bus, gonna be better cuz I just bought an
'80 Vanagon. I'm making the Westi real nice....engine wise, I'm taking the
best pieces and putting 'em in the Westi. This'll leave me with a 'spare'
'80 Vanagon engine. I wanna put this beast in my '71 hardtop Westi. I
figure a set of Porsche 914 heads and exhaust and a set of dual carbs and
this thing would be a good runner. Any opinions, ideas, helpful hints? 
Earlier someone posted to the list regarding the Type 4 air schroud for
the Type4 engine. I'm curious as to whether this shroud would work on the
Vanagon engine (is it the same as a Type4?) Anyway, any info would be
appreciated. Thanks!
