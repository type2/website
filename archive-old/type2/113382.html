&gt;Man- Look at CIP's website. They only list 2 sizes, one for early and one
&gt;for late, and they don't correlate to those sizes. Maybe that's why you hear
&gt;so many complaints about cables being too long. They've cut it down to 2
&gt;generic lengths that aren't really right for anything? Tom

All the various lengths are nicely labelled and available from www.GoWesty_dot_com, .
