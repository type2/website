Subject: Re: [T2] bus idles high when warm

Mike,

Is this the one with megasquirt on it?

Check your megasquirt datalogs?  Solid lifters if I remember correctly?
Last adjustment on the solids?



How high is high idle?

If this is the one with megasquirt on it, you should only have to worry
about intake leaks *after* the throttle body and no place else.

Maybe one of your injectors really likes to be hot before it works good?
Cold start injector disconnected?


Cheers, dave

&gt; I can't seem to figure out why my bus is idling high when it gets warm

&gt; vacuum leaks or anything like that.  I've even pulled pulled and plugged 
&gt; the vacuum line that actuates the decel valve in hopes that maybe that 
&gt; was faulty.  Is there anything else to test to see what might be causing 
&gt; this high idle?
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I'll go through one more time with the starting fluid and test 
&gt; for vacuum leaks, but I think I got 'em all pretty good...
&gt; 
&gt; it's a 78 2liter.  Oh, and it did the same thing on my other engine, too.
