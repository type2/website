Subject: Balancing Dual Carbs

'73 bus
I have been trying to locate a uni-syn carb balancer but they cost a lot
for so little use.  Does anyone know an alternative or a cheap place to
get one?  I have been also tring to locate a head light switch since mine
no longer does anything at all.
	On a side note I have a cheapo tach that was given to me.  It has
four wires on it: white, green, red, and black.  When I hook up the black
to ground and the red to the coil on the side that goes to the dizzy(thin
wire)  I get eratic readings at idle from 0 to 1000 rpm, the needle is
jumping all over the place.  When I raise the rpms the tach just goes
dead, back to 0.
	Maybe someone can tell me what I am doing wrong.  It
might be the el cheapo factor.
