&gt; Also, &quot;doghouse&quot; might be a poor choice. Doesn't this refer to a specific oil-cooler arrangement only from 71 on? Therefore one year only on north american buses?

The doghouse oil-cooler is the same oil-cooler used in 68-70 buses, it's 
just the fanshroud that's differnt.  Post 70 (?) beetles also used 
doghouse shrouds, so they're readily available, although there are 
aparently some differences between the bus and beetle shroudings (the 
beetle shroud is apparently slightly smaller volume).  If you have the 
shroud, you can convert to the doghouse setup with a step stud.  Fairly 
straightforward and easy...
