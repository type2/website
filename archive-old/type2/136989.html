&gt; Ratone Pass. A kick ass climb but take it easy and then once over 
&gt; there is almost no further climbing till you have to go over Monument 
&gt; hill on I25 just southof denver. If it is snowing that hill can Eat 
&gt; you. Lots of wrecks on that hill every time it snows. By the way, when 
&gt; you come down off Raton Pass you enter the town of Trinadad. It is the 
&gt; place to go for sex change opperations in the US. More done there than 
&gt; anywhere else in the US (not talking from personal experience). Have a
