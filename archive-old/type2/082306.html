Subject: Re: [T2] Workshop Manual...

Hiya Rogelio,

When we last discussed the thermostat cable issue I believe that you 
mentioned that you had a 69.  If so, you are in luck manual-wise.  Volkswagen 
itself published a service manual for the early (68-70) baywindow busses.  
This manual addresses all areas of Type 2 maintenance for those years.  Some 
very detailed stuff.  Internal wiring diagrams for switches, for instance.  
However, some procedures are of the &quot;barebones&quot; approach to writing.  I find 
that, for my needs, my other manuals supplement this one quite well.

Here's what you need to look for (it is, as you might well suspect, long out 
of print - but it is around.  I can send you a good source if you need 
one)...........
