&gt; &gt;Now, that I have this installed, I have noticed that she is tough to
&gt; start.
&gt; &gt;She just cranks and cranks, never lighting up.  Then all of a sudden,
&gt; boom,
&gt; &gt;she's started!! (there is no literal BOOM...)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;How could changing the AFM cause this to happen?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It's like the engine isn't getting any gas...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;any ideas?

&gt; I ran that AFM on my bus for 2 days to make sure it worked. It did. I
&gt; had no hard start or long cranking problems.
&gt; First I would check that the fuel pump is running while the engine is
&gt; cranking.
&gt; Then I would test fuel pressure.
&gt; It kinda sounds like you have a lean mixture problem. That AFM ran and
&gt; idled perfectly where the mixture screw is set [on my engine]. If your
&gt; pressure is low you will have a lean problem.
Marcus:
Sounds to me like the cold start valve is not working. This could be for
2 reasons:
1. Valve is plugged or othewise inoperable.
2. No electrical signal to cold start valve (bad thermo time switch)
Look at Bently for test details and remember:BE REALLY CAREFUL AROUND
RAW GAS! Bently says this too, also a good time to replace those old
hoses which will fail eventually with 30 psi gas in them and if you're
not lucky can burn your car completely. I once bought a 75 bus parts car 
that was so burned that the only good parts were the front axle beam ,
the trans, and the internal engine parts. There is no margin for error
here!
