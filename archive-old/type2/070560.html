Subject: kick panels

Someone once gave me a good idea for new kick panels, make your own. 
He mentioned picking up some paneling/plastic/?? from Home Depot and 
using the old panels as a pattern. I thought this was a great idea, 
but cant seem to find the right type of material for the job. Has 
anyone done this? If so, what type of material did you use? and where 
did you get it from?

thanks!
todd.
