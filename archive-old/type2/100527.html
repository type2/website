Subject: Heater questions (replacement of ducting)

     It's that time of year.  I can't put off replacing all the heating 
stuff I need anymore.  My question is what have folks used as non-stock 
replacements for heater ducting?  I was thinking of using either PVC pipe or 
aluminum pipe instead of paper tubing for the main pipe that goes from the 
rear to the front of the bus (I think it's about 3&quot; wide by 5-6 feet long).  
What types of materials will hold up to the heat?  Will PVC pipe melt, or 
give off fumes that will kill me?  I heard somebody mention the black 
corrugated plastic pipe, does that work, does it slow down the air allot?  I 
am going to do all the insulation and stuff too, but I got to get the heat 
in before I can worry about it going out!

     Also, as a side note, I put new  tires on the bus this weekend, the 
yokohama C rated tires from tirerack_dot_com.  I drove the thing about 20 miles 
on passenger tires (205's) to a friends house to have the  tires put on (The 
only other time I drove it with those tires was about 5 miles to get it 
home).  The difference between the passenger tires on the way there, and the 
right tires on the way back were phenomenal!  WOW, what a difference it 
makes to have the right tires!

Jay
