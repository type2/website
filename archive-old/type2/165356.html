Subject: Don's Mom (Was: BA6 for sale)

I'm leaving tomorrow morning, first thing. Because there's no death
certificate yet (because she was alone when she died, they are
requiring an autopsy first), she won't be buried until Wed or Thurs.
But I have to deal with her affairs while I'm out there so I figure
I'd better get there ASAP.

I'm taking the Guac because she has a bunch of heirlooms I need to
bring back, including a 40 year collection of milkglass that she
wanted my daughter to have. Two large chests full of the stuff.

Against my better judgement, I'm doing an oil change and tune up this
afternoon. I usually prefer to do that stuff a couple days before I
leave so if I oopsied and forgot the drain plug or something, I would
discover it near home instead of in the middle of nowhere. But it's
way past time for that maintenance anyway and it needs to be done.

(Assuming my bolt comes in today... heh)

Has the Airs list been cleaned up yet? I haven't heard anything about
it in a while...


I do want to thank everybody for their good wishes. You guys are amazing!

(I still have the heater... ;-)  )
