Subject: Re: Brake servo question

Engine vacuum is the power source for the brake servo.  When the engine is not
running, there is no vacuum, therefore, no power to the servo.  When you apply
the brakes when the engine is not running, you have to overcome the residual
pressure in the servo, as well as the hydraulic pressure in the master
cylinder, so the pedal effort is now considerably higher than when the engine
is running.  It's normal - nothing wrong with your servo.  If the brakes get
hard to apply when the engine is running, that's a different story.

&gt; My first attempt at carburetor adjustment was less than stellar. My bus

&gt; synchronized, after getting the exhaust leak fixed -- the window gets
&gt; installed in there somewhere). My question is: I noticed when she stalls
&gt; that the brakes get really hard to push, like power brakes when the
&gt; engine's off. Is this a normal result of the vacuum connection to the servo
&gt; not being active with the engine off, or is it a sign of a problem? It only
&gt; happens when the engine stalls.

&gt; P.S. The German window seals I picked up at WCM today *do* look a tad bit
&gt; leaner, so I'm optimistic.
