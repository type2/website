&gt; I have four very nice 205x70x14 tires, like new with lots of tread
&gt; (10/32), M+S, an off-brand (Arizona). I took them off the DOA '87 Syncro
&gt; when I parted it out.
&gt;
&gt; I need to replace the totally rotten tires on my '64 Standard. Are these
&gt; 205s I have too wide for the stock rims?  I'm not thinking of these as
&gt; long term tires, just something to put on as part of a program to
&gt; resurrect the bus and get it back on the streets.
&gt;
I ran a set of 205's on my '67 for a while. They were Goodyears, (the tires,
although the time with the bus was too...), and while they were rather fat, I
never had any problem. They were used, and I ran them for about a year or so
until I could buy new ones...
