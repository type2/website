Subject: Re: [T2] Stock Exhaust choices

I have an Ernst acquired from BD about five years ago.  As I recall it
wasn't a perfect fit but worked.

I had it off when I swapped engines last summer and do not recall any
serious problems bolting it up to the new engine.

It has lasted well. I've kept it painted with high temperature aluminum
paint so there's no rust. Do kinda wish it were quieter though.

Curious what others have to say.

Cheers,

John R
