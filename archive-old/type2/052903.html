Subject: RE: '78 ca smog q's

Easiest way out is to wait until 2008 when the smog equipment
won't matter any more. Otherwise you'll have to find out exactly
what a 1978 came with stock. Consider borrowing a complete
setup from a friend, then give it back after you pass the smog
inspection.

. . . all the other fi stuff is there and apparently
unaltered. it does need a new muffler tho'. so what do i have to do, other
than replace the obvious muffler, to pass ca's smog test? simply put on a
cat? i called the cal dmv and they simply said it has to pass the
requirements for '78 and it isn't required to have a cat.

does anyone have any experience with this before i lay down the $ for a smog
test i know i'll fail and then head unkowingly to an exhaust shop?
