Subject: Re: [T2] Modern day CD player into our Bay windows??

So ... Is there a difference between early and late bay dashboards? My '74
did require cutting and others I have seen either had obvious hacksaw traces
or the old-style radio-mount.

My '79 dash is uncut and doesnt have any round holes, my CD player fit right

it with very minor work..
