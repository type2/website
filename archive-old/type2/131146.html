Subject: Re: [T2] Weird weird electrical problems.  I'm lost.

When I got my 73 westy the wiring was a nightmare.  It took Bently, Chilton,
Hayes and Muir along with some of my own conclusions to get the wiring to
work.  They had actually moved the fuse block down so it was easier to
change fuses, bad sign that they screwed something up and bad.  Anyway what
I found in my bus was that the outer tube was supposed to be 12v.  Reason
being is that the center of the steering column was the ground for the horn
and that the tube actually had a connection on the bottom at the floor that
was giving it 12v.  I know that if the plastic bushings and the like can
wear out so that the horn shorts out before it gets to wheel.  I believe the
steeling lock can be at fault some times.  I also had a bad turn signal/
flasher relay which when replaced fixed a bunch of strange things that
happened with my turn signals.  I would check to see if that fuse blows
right after you put it in.  Also see which circuits are using the fuse.  Once
you know what circuits that fuse is on then you have narrowed what might be
causing the problem.  It was many long hours tracing wires with my
volt/ohm meter but it worked out great in the end and now my electrical is
rock solid.  Electrical sucks but at least its not as complicated as a new
car.  I don't post on the list a bunch but I read it a lot and hopefully this
will give you a few ideas on what might help.
