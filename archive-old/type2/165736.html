Subject: Hi-beams are always on

Hello all,

'71 westy, stock 1600dp, no electrical or mechanical modifications.

A week ago my blinkers and high beam headlights went goodbye while
driving around town. I took apart the turn signal/hi-beam assembly and
found that a brown wire had become disconnected. I soldered it back on
and my blinkers worked, I pulled the lever and the highbeams came on.
They however do not turn off unless I turn the ignition off.

I did not hear a click when I pulled the high beam lever. I used to,
but now, no click - so it doesn't turn off. I searched the archives
and found that the brown wire can cause shorts.

This post,http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/111678.html, leads me to
believe the switch is bad. I do not hear the clicks.

I have not started the bus as I do not want to cause any wierd
electrical fires. Is it okay to start and drive the bus, and where do
I start with the diagnosis of my high beam switch.

Thank you all.
12 days until I depart for Inuvik, NT
