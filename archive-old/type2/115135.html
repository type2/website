Subject: fuel filter replacement questions

I have a '78 FI bus that needs a new fuel filter and a new hose between the
filter and the metal fuel line that feeds it. I'm going to replace the hose
directly connected to either side of the filter.

Question: is there a clean method for removing and replacing the hose between
the filter and the metal fuel line, where I don't end up with gas pouring out
while I'm trying to attach the new hose?
I'm thinking I may just get some empty 6 gallon gas cans and just drain the
tank into them before I do this. Add's some extra time up front, but I'm
hoping it'll prevent getting gas all over me
while I'm trying to attach the new hose.

What I'm actually planning to do is replace the filter and the hose on either
end of it.
I plan to do the following:

1. Preassemble my hose-filter-hose piece according to the existing hose
lengths.
2. Remove the old hose attached to the fuel pump (incoming side) and plug it.
3. Take my pre-assembled hose-filter-hose piece and attach it to the pump.
4. Remove the old hose attached to the metal fuel line, so now the old
hose-filter-hose is off.
5. Attach the new hose.

Also - anyone attach an in-line valve  next to the filter so you could stop
the gas next time you wanted to change the filter? what kind of valve would
you use?


Thanks
Mat '78 bus
