Subject: Re: Diesel in a Bay

It's not as big of a project as you would think.. I put a 1.6 TD into a
air cooled vanagon.

but in a bay the rear deck is mucho higher then a vanagon.. so you
&quot;should&quot; be able to fit it in the upright position with a KEP adapter
plate ($600 +/-). 

you don't have to change your tranny gears.. a VW I4 diesel has a very
similar RPM range as a AC2.0L abd the torque is consistant thru the RPM
band.  Most vanagon Diesels get a van AC tranny swapped in for a more
ideal ratio.

the biggest part would be custom exhaust (not that hard) and engine
mounts.. but a I4Diesel doesn't weigh all that much differant from a 2.0
air cooled and is 'shorter' hangs off the tranny less . all you would
need are some hanger type mounts from the bus engine carrier bar
locations.

the radiator and plumbing is more teadious then difficult.. but hey
you'll have great and reliable odor free heat with improved fuel milage
(26mpg in my TD van) for a better range between fill ups (important for
a camper IMO)

my preferred rad mount is the round spare tire look alike.. but a good
and close runner up is to replace the back engine trunk lid with a grill
and swing away type rad mount (use the staock rabbit rad and hoses are
both on same end.).. 

plus it's EMissions EXEMPT in most states... you'd be replacing a older
gas engine with a newer diesel and with new rings/compression and
injectors you have 100K+ reliability before you have to do anything
other then change the oil..
I would highly recommend getting your state title changed to DIESEL
officially quickly so that it's fully grandfathered in .. 
if the federallies give any troubles, tel them it's an alternative fuel
vehicle and what form to fill out.. most states have alt fuel
leniencies.
