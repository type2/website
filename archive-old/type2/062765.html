Well, to give the guy some credit (for gullibility, specifically), if
his speedometer is just a little more enthusiastic than mine (which
reads *merely* 10% above actual), it probably does indicate 120 when
doing 80 or 85.  Such a speed is quite believable for a souped-up bus,
since mine will do an indicated 75 (actual ~67) on flat ground with a
new 1600 engine in it (and will peg at 85 when going down Raton pass).

Of course, I wanna know where he got a speedometer that reads higher
than 85....
