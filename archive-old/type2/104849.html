Subject: Re: [T2] 1776 aspirations

In all fairness, I grew up in Los Angeles, and I remember the misery of
breathing the smog when I was a kid. My chest hurt, and my eyes burned. It
really was bad. That was with a lot less people and development, back in the
50's. They used to burn trash here, too, and everyone did it on the same
day. Everyone had a little cement chimney stack or cupola in the back corner
of the yard, and most of the trash was burned. There was no trash pick up. I
remember seeing the little plumes of smoke all rising into the air from all
over the neighborhood.
I'm really glad that they do care about air quality, but no one appreciates
an analretentive politician or a bureaucrat with obcessive compulsive
personality disorder.
And the cops! Don't even get me started about the cops. Ramparts is not all
that long ago, nor was it the only scandal. Good cops I have no problem
with, but you never know what you'll get into with them. It's the luck of
the draw. Experience has shown me that they are not all their cracked up to
be.
And now for the obligatory Volkswagen content:
I will never understand why they came down on VW so hard for emissions when
they did, when at the time, most were modest polluters at best. Compared to
today's super efficient cars, I'm sure there is no comparison, however.
