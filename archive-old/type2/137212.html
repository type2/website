&gt; First, I am convinced that no new Westy ever looked this good. The
&gt; shine in the paint is too deep, and the tires are too black.

And the wheels should be silver, not white.
 
&gt; But looking for the silver lining in this cloud, I decided that the key
&gt; to a show bus is to wash your windows. Look at those windows! When I
&gt; get Peregrine running again, I'm going to be fanatical about washing
&gt; the windows.

Yes.  Nice wheels and bumpers go a long way, too.  An afternoon 
spent painting rims is worth a week spent touching up body paint.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
