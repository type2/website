Subject: Re: Breadloaf Safari Windshield

As the pic with the bodged up windscreen seems to have ammused you all, I 
thought I would mail you about 2 GENUINE products that are currently on sell in
the UK.

If you have a loaf but secrectly want a splitty then these are products for you!

There are two companies making fiberglass splitty fronts to go over a loafs
front panel. 

The not so good one retains the loaf winscreen and wipers.

The better one has a splitty windscreen frame and peak incorporated; requires
the wipers and wiper motors to be changed to splitty style. Yes, this will 
allow safari winscreens to be fitted.

I've seen a couple of vans with these. The first panel just makes a loaf look 
like a loaf with a different front panel. The second panel (if well done) does 
look quite effective.

Personaly they are not 'my cup of tea'. I bought a loaf because I like the 
style and wanted one; I don't consider it second rate to a splitty - just a bit 
different.

I've no commercial information on these (even if you want it) but these things 
are out there somewhere.
