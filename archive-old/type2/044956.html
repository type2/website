&gt; I've recently seen 110 V impact wrenches for ~$60.00 that claimed a capacity
&gt; in excess of 250 ft./lbs. of torque, marginally adequate for rear axle nuts.
&gt;
&gt; I'm interested in real-world experience with such tools, especially in
&gt; reference to Type 2 applications.

Fred,
My neighbor got one of those 250 ft/lb ones for the rear axle nut application.
Sat there until he was blue in the face trying to remove an axle nut.  His
cousin happened to come by and saw what was up, castigated him with something
like &quot;Sheet, why don't you use a real torque wrench&quot; and proceeded to go out to
his truck and brought back another electric torque wrench, but this one was a
'bit' larger.  Don't remember its rating, but it was upwards of 450 ft/lbs.
The axle nut came right off.

Scott
