Subject: Re: [T2] Need size of nut that holds down the steering wheel


It is 16 x 1.5   but.....I seriously doubt you will find one locally.
You would be better off getting a metric thread file. It has 8 sides, 4 on
each end, each one a different pitch. Use the 1.5 side and restore the threads
that way. It will be a useful tool in your tool box......more so than a die
that only fits the steering column.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My threads are messed up on the steering column where the nut holds down the
steering wheel..........i want to buy a die, but do not know the
size......vehicle is a 1970 type 2.

My version of Etka is down right now, or i would look it up myself.
