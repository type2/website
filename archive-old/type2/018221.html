&gt; Using this logic is all the more reason to use 40 weight in the summer!

          Actually, straight 50 wt. is bestin summer for dino-oil.  I used
the 20-50 in WI and MN winters. I now use 15-15 Mobil 1 synoil, which is
much better, and just use it year around. In 80-90 Alabama weather, my oil
temps never went above 220 until I got out on the freeway, doing a steady
70-75, and then it never hit 240 until I'd come down off the ramp and sit
at a stoplight.
