  horizontal?

Hello List,

I have heard this about car batteries too. Can any one
explain this to me? I always try to be on the safe
side by setting the battery on a piece of wood. I am
the kind of person who likes to play it safe but I
would like to think that my precautions are founded on
something other than superstition.

Just wondering,

Have a great day!

David Kelly
