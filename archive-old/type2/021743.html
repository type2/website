Subject: Progressive carb icing

BTW George, you didn't mention that icing can't occur at real low temops
because there is so little moisture in the air to condense.
--My 71 now in the woods still has a progressive &quot;Pinto&quot; carb on it,
bolted to the stock manifold via an adaptor. Never had icing problems. 
I made a bottom plate for the narrow air cleaner, and a top plate with 6
springs coming from little eyebolts.  This lets you slide the top on and
clip it down. I made a manual choke that cabled from the wall behind the
driver back to the carb.   My milage didn't change, but my &quot;get on the
ramp&quot; acceleration was great when I floored it.

&gt; A piece of data for carb icing fanatics:
&gt; 
&gt; Carb icing does not require cold temperatures and in fact cannot occur at temperatures below freezing.  Air goes into the carb at, say, 55F and is sped up in the venturi.
&gt; The temperature of the air drops to 30F at which point any moisture in the air will condense out and freeze into ice.  If the ice starts to
&gt; build up, you end up with the problem called carb icing.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea that carb icing is most serious from 50F to 70F is drummed into the head of any student pilot,
