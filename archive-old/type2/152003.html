&gt; 30 minute run on the interstate at 75-80 and I can't even touch the
&gt; bumper, while oil temps are about 210F

do you have the bumper heat guard there between the muffler and the
bumper, (I can count on one hand the number I've actually seen installed,
and have left over fingers)
  if not it isn't the bus engine that is running hot but just radiated
muffler heat, perfectly normal...
