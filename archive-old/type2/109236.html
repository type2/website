Subject: Re: [T2] I can't get my reverse lights to work

Eron,

I drive a 73 Westy, Same problem with the reverse lights.

The reverse light are lit when a switch in the transmission case, ( two
spade connectors with a plastic funnel shield around) closes.  This
naturally happens when you shift into reverse.  First you must check that
this trany swich works.  You want infinite resistance with the trany in all
gears and neutral and zero (or near zero) resistance with the trany in
reverse. Use a ohmmeter or a pilot 'test light, powered at on end.

If the switch is ok then test the wires.  These go from the + (15) coil
terminal (black wire) to the switch and then from the switch to the right
side tail light and from there to the left side tail light.  You have to
have 12 volt at the coil 15 terminal for the van to run.  We know that.  Do
you have 12 volt at the trany switch with the ignition on?  And if you did
and the switch is closing you have to have 12 at the lights center post with
the trany in reverse and the ignition on.  If  you did and the lights do not
come on your problem is the ground to the bulb.

I ended up rewiring mine and taking the feed from a relay controlled block
that powers an after market electric fuel pump in my van.  I do no like al
these services attached to the coil, not least because it powers a
electronic ingnition that maybe sensitive to voltage fluctuations.  So I
took them off including carb chokes and cutoff solenoids and put them under
relay control.  The relay feed is from the battery directly.  It works.

Good luck, Andrea
