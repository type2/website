Subject: Re: [T2] Turn Signal, emergency flashers revisited.

just curious but have you tried sanding the inside of the connections out where the bulbns go..
 mine quit working once and i found out that the seals wernt holding on the front turn lights and that they had rusted inside.. this was right after purchase..
just a thought this may or may not be a problem for you but thought i would mention it..

i used a small dremel roll with sand paper on it.. that way i could get up in the hole where the bulb goes..
peace

&gt;Hi Everyone,
&gt;
&gt;I have tired everything to get my turn signal and emergency flashers to 
&gt;work.  I have posted the list before and received some awesome ideas.  I 
&gt;tryed them all and finally gave up.  I have been revisiting this problem 
&gt;this week, and again I'm stuck.
&gt;The emergency flashers do not work.  When I pull the knob out, not even the 
&gt;bulb lights up.  The turn signals do not work either.  When I engage the 
&gt;turn signal, the green light on the dash board lights up.
&gt;
&gt;Here is what I have tired.
&gt;
&gt;1.  I removed the emergency flasher switch and tested it according to the 
&gt;Bently manual.  It's good.
&gt;2.  I replaced all bulbs.  Ones in the rear and front.
&gt;3.  I replaced the fuses.
&gt;
&gt;When I removed the connections from the emergency flasher switch, I thought 
&gt;I would remember how they went back on.  That could be the problem as well, 
&gt;I should have taken a digital picture.  Is anyone able to send me a digital 
&gt;picture of their switch?
&gt;
&gt;I have a 78 ASI conversion.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks very much in advance,
&gt;Don Manzano
