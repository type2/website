Subject: Solex? Weber? Which one is it?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Volks,
	I brought back a bus from 8 years of hibernation today. It didn't start 
one morning and so they left it sitting in their garage for 8 long years 
until I came along and they offered to pay me to get it running again. 
Can't beat that.
	Unfortunately, the carburator is running rich, but I was going to rebuild 
it anyway. My problem is that I'm confused about which rebuild kit to buy. 
The bus is a '72 with the 1700 pancake engine. The owners know NOTHING 
about VWs, so they aren't any help. Sometime before these owners bought the 
bus, the dual carbs were switched out for a dual barrel progressive. I did 
the same thing to my bus and so I figured I would already know how to clean 
it and dial it in. BUT... It's not a Webber like I have. It's a Solex. And 
althought it LOOKS similar to mine, it is mounted (what seems like) 
backwards. It's got two stock looking ports on the front (FIF) that the two 
vacuum lines from the distributor hook up to. On the back it's got the fuel 
intake nozzle and on the driver's side it's got the electronic choke and 
the accelerator cable hook-up.
	Anyone know what I'm looking at here? I need a rebuild kit. Will the 
Webber kits work? EXACTLY what rebuild kit should I ask for when I go to 
the parts store?
Thanks Thanks Thanks,
Joel
