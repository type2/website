Subject: Taking a Federal car into CA?

This isn't strictly bus related, but I figure you guys are the most likely
to know.  What're the rules for bringing a car from outside into
California?  A friend of mine is thinking of moving there, and I'm unsure
if his car (bought in Washington state) will pass California emissions
standards or not.  Can you bring in a Federal car, or do you *have* to buy
a California emissions model upon moving into the state?

I'm in Michigan, so I'm a bit hazy on the whole thing.  California is like
a different country to me.
