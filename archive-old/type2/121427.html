&gt;Any resources on where to get PastellWeib L90d paint?
&gt;I thought I saw someone on the list who had some.
&gt;thanks all.

Your local auto paint store will be able to mix you up some but you are going to have to reduce it before you attempt to apply it with a brush so ask for instructions and get the approperiate reducer. Otherwise, it will be too thick and be hard to apply.

I bought a spray can of L54D for my super beetle before I sold it years ago. I had a very good experience with the color match (you have to remove the oxidation from the rest of the paint first to come close) and the price was good. I can't remember how far the can went...

You could try an online source like &lt;http://www.paintscratch_dot_com/&gt; although I think it's too expensive. I've heard from a few folks many NAPA locations can mix paint and give you a spray can. I would try them first.

WW's catalog used to have L90D in the spary can. I've been watching their site for a long time but they haven't stocked it for about 2 years.

FYI, BD has a few colors for sale:
