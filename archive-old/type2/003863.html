Hello,
Many thanks to all who gave there more than helpfull advice to relinquish my
problem. However the timing was correct at full advance and everything else
checked out fine. I was about to rebuild my carb and when I went to B.A.P
 local VW parts retailer here in phx). The very helpfull employee informed
me to check my Idle control and low and behold there was the problem. It was
no longer moving. I was now wondering if the idle control is interchangable
between different model Solex carbs? (ya I know it's only 14bucks but I am
broke like broke broke)
I have a few other solex carbs laying around and was wondering if one of
them would work for mine as a temp fix until I get paid.
Thanks in advance,
Scott Beaupied
