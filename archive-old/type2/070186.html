re: &quot;calling it a hobby doesn't make it any less dirty or dangerous&quot;, ie
government should take away our old cars.

Damn right.  Also fill in dangerous home swimming pools, license power saws,
melt down wood stoves, forbid use of fireplaces, ban guns of any age, sort,
condition, or use; take all spray paints and all oil based paints off the
market; ya da da pesticides; ya da da fertilizer; ya da da diesel fuel;
... propane; ... razor blades; ... pets; ... more than two children per
family.  Stop wherever you think appropriate.  I think stopping BEFORE
outlawing some pitifully small percentage of beloved old cars would be
fine.
