Subject: Whoops...  Timing your Volkswagen

Volks,

In case any of you have not noticed yet....  I am pretty severely
dyslexic :-( before and after; left and right; clockwise, anticlockwise
(or counterclockwise if you prefer)... whatever...  I am not too good at
them :-( (I still have to check the scar on my *right* wrist every time)

Karl points out two errors in my previous post.  One is minor, one not.
In the final chapter of my tale of woe, the vac advance dist I have should
be and is timed at 7.5 degrees *before* not after TDC and had been
erroniously timed at 5 degrees *after* not before.

The second is more serious...  His name is Karl *von Salzen* and nothing
else!  I feel especially bad about this one because of all our members,
Karl is among the best.  For parts, for advice, and for generally being a
great person... Hip, Hip, Hooray! (please don't &quot;metoo&quot; (we don't want to
crash the list :-))

                           H Steven Dolan
