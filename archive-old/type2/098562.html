Subject: Re: [T2] headlight &quot;eyebrows&quot;

you all may think they look &quot;kewl&quot; (who the hell started spelling it that
way, anyway?)... but i think they look ridiculous! they make bugs and
busses look STONED! and let's face it, like we dont already have to
battle THAT stereotype enough as it is. the bug i had before my 65 had
the cateyes when i bought it... that was the FIRST thing i did to that
car... removed them!

sorry, there are alot of cool accesories for bugs and busses, why would
anyone WANT their car to look stoned or stupid on purpose? you all are
silly.

waving and shakin my head at all the silly silly people who actually LIKE
those eyebrows!
