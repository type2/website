Subject: Re: [T2] Engine conversion

&lt;That would be if you put a lot in there  every Porsche 356 
owner I know including myself always put some Marvel Mystery oil in with the 
gas,  Now Marvel is a real lite weight oil like 8 or 10   Also I have ran 2 
stroke  before when I had too without any problems  smoked a little but didnt hurt 
anything.  I have gotten where I store my old electric fuel pumps with Marvel 
in them also as I was having problems with them gumming up just sitting&gt;

I was thinking of old dirty engine oil. Marvel Mystery Oil is good stuff! Excellent light oil.
