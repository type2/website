Subject: Parting Out 1980 Manual Westy

Hi,

I have a parts van headed to the grave very soon.  I drive a 1981 Automatic,
so if anyone wants to trade parts I have manual parts to trade for automatic
parts (distributor, ecu, starter...).  The parts van is running, and the
tranny and brakes work.  the body is junk b/c it is all rusted out and the
interior is mostly gone.

Let me know if you want something, I may have it.  Though I am keeping (or
trading) most of the ignition, FI systems, etc.  The tranny works and can
go.

Email me at type2**at**twcny.rr_dot_com

-Steve
