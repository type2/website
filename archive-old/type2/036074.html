Hi Mark!
I belive that alpine have a radio with the screen that
pop out and is about 4&quot; X 5&quot; or so (nicely stored)and
display a multi functional device just like the one
you are referring about. I have a magazine that
actually have a little about that. I will try to find
out specifics and posted later on. I know they are
putting this in newer cars, so I don't know if works
with the computer of the car or not.

&gt; I was just staring absentmindedly at my Timex watch
&gt; ($19.95) and thinking 
&gt; about how much data I get on the tiny (1/4&quot; X 5/8&quot;)
&gt; LCD tucked under the 
&gt; analog display. All I have to do is push a button to
&gt; get different 
&gt; displays of elapsed time, and who knows what else.
&gt; 
&gt; I further reflect that I have two (comparatively
&gt; huge) LCDs in Peregrine 
&gt; -- one in my radio, and another in my CB. Now
&gt; wouldn't it be nice if I 
&gt; could wire in data from my oil temp sender, a CHT,
&gt; an oil pressure 
&gt; sender, and a vacuum sender, and just push a button
&gt; to select a display? 
&gt; Or have the numbers all on the screen at once. And
&gt; store a maximum for 
&gt; each (minimum for oil pressure)? Or push a button
&gt; and display nothing at all.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone on the list knows anyone in the consumer
&gt; electronics business,
&gt; tell them that there's probably a substantial market
&gt; for aftermarket
&gt; radios that also display gauge data, and that I will
&gt; be more than happy to
&gt; test the prototype.
