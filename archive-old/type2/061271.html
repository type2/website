Difference?  Rust, bad door seals, etc etc.  Anything that lets outside
air in. closed heaterboxes. Missing center heater tube.  mouse nests
blocking airflow. Lots of things.:)

I found out this morning that I will never again let ANYONE tell me an
aircooled doesnt produce heat.  I have 2 VW toys that are melted to prove
it.  Thats what I get for keeping them on the dash, hmm?  the sliding door
splitty looks like it had an engine fire....and the bug..well...looks like
someone took an inch out of its passengerside pan....warped!

*sigh*

...david (with more leaks then I can name here...heat is good, but the
cold air covers it up..)
