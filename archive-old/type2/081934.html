Subject: Re: [T2] Missing wire to flasher switch and weird



&gt; I'm having problems with the turn signals and
&gt; emergency flashers also.  They light up, but
&gt; don't flash.  I suspect the relay and have now
&gt; pulled it.  It was full of water!  Gotta get that
&gt; windshield seal/rust problem fixed.
&gt;
If you don't want it to happen again repair the windshield leak and then
replace the flasher.  If you can't fix the windshield right now go ahead and
get a spare relay when you get one and a FLAPS one works fine.

This helped me on mine.  Hope it helps for you..

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
