&gt; I've used TUFOIL additive in my 78 Westy engine ever since I got it at

still
&gt; with 135lbs compression.  Is it TUFOIL (aPTFE additive that's been
proven
&gt; to extend the life of warehouse machines) or dumb luck or sensible
&gt; driving??  Obviously hasn't hurt it!  Seeya at Litchfield!

I'd venture a guess that the reason that the additive hasn't harmed
your engine is that it is trapped in your oil filter.  As long as it
doesn't clog the filter, your engine is protected from the additive.
