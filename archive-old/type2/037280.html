Pat,

Good compressions!  I agree that new fuel lines and new pushrod tube seals
are in order and will get you many miles down the road... but... if you
are going as far as taking the tin off to retorque the heads, I would go
one step further.  

I beleive that the valve guides in VW's are an unsuspected weak point.  
If you are far enough in to retorque, then you are far enough in to pop
the heads off, take them to a machine shop and ask them to measure valve
guide wear.  This should be less than $50 and a day or two.  If the valve
guides are worn, the amount of blow-by is very large, and I believe that
this is what causes pushrod tube seal failure.  I have no data, just my
personal belief, but there it is, my humble opinion.  I would welcome
other opinions or more data.  Anyone?
