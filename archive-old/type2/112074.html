Seth I'm pretty sure there is a difference btwn the 205 &amp; the 009
layout, but put that aside. 

turn your engine to TDC of the compression stroke on cyl #1.
(verify this by making sure the valves on #1 don't want to move
anywhere near this position)

now put whatever distributor you want in. note the small mark on the
rim of the body. by rotating the body align this mark (or light
knotch) with the rotor button. this is #1 on the dist

replace the dist cap. pull all 4 wires. put the one going to the #1
cyl on the cap connection that corresponds with the mark.

follow the cap around anti-clockwise putting the plug wires back in
the order 1-2-3-4. making sure each wire actually goes where you want
it to (i.e. the correct cyl)

now see what you have. If you have already done this, just double
check it. When swaping out distributors and the like, it sure gets
easy to swap some stuff up.
