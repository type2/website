Subject: Choke rpm cam

Could anyone tell me where the step cam to adjust idle rpm when cold
starting (chokes fully closed, or nearly so) is on a '72 1800 dual carb
setup?  I've seen this cam on bug carbs, it's a big fat stepped cam on
the side of the carb, but can't seem to find anything like this on my
PDSIT's to adjust warmitup rpm's.
	Reason: my chokes work fine (open up in about 5 minutes) but the idle
isn't high enough when warming up - engine usually stalls after 30-40
seconds unless I give it *just a little* juice for those initial 3
minutes or so.  Once warm everything's aok.

Thanks y'all.
