Subject: [T2] broken studs(paging, Buck...)

Gentlepersons-
                       A friend returning from the UK brought back an 
improved type of EZ Out.
They're self-centering - making their own pilot hole as they enter the broken 
stud/bolt/
what have you. The site I have for them is
&lt;http://www.bardolph.co_dot_uk/search/supplier/aldencorp.htm&gt;
Luckily, I haven't had to try them on an exhaust stud yet...but I've tried 
them on some 
assorted pieces about the shop, here, and they seem to work quite well. Much 
better 
than the regular EZ Outs that I've tried. Anyone on the other side of the 
pond familiar
with them...or know if they're available stateside?
