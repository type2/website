Hey-
I recently had some brake work at a shop and it was my first time to this
shop.  I just had knee surgery, so the thought of doing brake work, just
makes it hurt.  Anyway, the day after we got the bus back , one of my
hubcaps and trim ring falls off.  We can't find them and what was a great
set of hubcaps for being original, are now gone.  Can I make a legitimate
complaint to the shop or is it just unlucky!

Thanks-
Jeff
