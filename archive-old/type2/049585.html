Subject: VDO oil pressure gauge

I was doing some wiring for a new radio. When I accidentally had a hot wire
touch the sensor side of this gauge. It now pegs all the way to the other
side past 80 when I start up the bus. Have I destroyed this gauge. If I get
voltage from the sender then it is the gauge that is bad - right?
