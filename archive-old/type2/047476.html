Subject: [T2] 79 Curiosities

My neighbor is trying to fix a friend's 79 Bus (seems I've become the
neighborhood expert given I'm always out tinkering with the 78).  We got it
running, plan to check things out this weekend. I'm relatively new to Busses
and I saw some things I couldn't Identify:

1) Two hoses on the opposite side of the battery, looked like propane or
air?
2) Large vented square unit under the Bus covering the large air duct? Is
this a BN6?
3) Fiberglass console that attaches to the ceiling over pass/driver's seats.
Has temp controls and what appears to be cooling/heating fins inside
directed towards the back of Bus?

The Bus had a electrical fire in the engine compartment (kids trying to
install CD changer in rear must of shorted something). Double relay looks
scorched but apparently working. What would cause this to heat?
Apart from directing the start-up gas to running gas, what does the double
relay do?

Thanks in advance,
