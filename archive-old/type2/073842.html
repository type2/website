Subject: Harley

Now you're getting it John.  All the same.  We go on campouts, were funny
clothes (at least I do), and go on carabussing.  They go on rallies, wear
funny clothes, and so forth.
It is about the ride, the trip, not the destination!!
Just a fan of both!!!
A true aficionado pulls his Harley behind his bus!!!
