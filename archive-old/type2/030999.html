DON'T,  if you have any desire to get to Alaska stay as far away from GEX
as it is humanly possible.  my type IV engine went 3396 miles and siezed.
found upon inspection, just about every possible error in manufacture
possible.  the &quot;New Pistons &amp; Cyl&quot; were from 3 different companies, 2 of
the P&amp;C from a company that had not made em in 10+ years.  balance was
almost at the replacement level.  etc, etc, etc.

if you want to throw your money away, give half to me, it will be less
headaches and you will come out ahead.
