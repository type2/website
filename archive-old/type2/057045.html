   Oh C'mon. 15 miles? If you have any confidence in your bus at all this
should not even be a question. I drive my bus all over the place. (1970 1500
SP hardtop camper)  Not a problem. I make 60 to 110 mile round trips often and
everything is always cool; literally. It runs about 210 to 230degrees. I live
in Kansas so it's not like it is exactly cool weather here either. Got me a
side mounted oil cooler too. I'm sure that is a great help. As for the heater
thing, we all know that an air cooled heat system never really &quot;warms things
up&quot; much, (although consistently driving around 50 mph increases the warmth
greatly) but hey, who cares....Dude....you are in &quot;THE BUS!!!!!&quot; Go for it. I
have unfortunately had to have one engine rebulilt, but it only cost me
$500.00. Alot cheaper than that honda, and a whole lot more satisfying.
Happy Trails : &gt;)
