Subject: GER: Meeting at the VW Bus Museum in Salzgitter
Message-ID: &lt;3713A708.8BBB0643_at_gmx_dot_de&gt;

Hi Volks,

since we consider the bus meeting and campout at the
VW Bus Museum Salzgitter last weekend to have been a
success, we are going to host a very similar event
October 1-3, 1999.  We'll try hard to not repeat the
mistakes we made this time, but I think I am not
exaggerating much in saying everyone had a good time
regardless of the few organizational shortcomings.

I'll post a more detailed invitation later, but this
is definitely taking place, so please include it in
your plans for the year.  (Making up for telling
you too late last time, I am telling you too early
now ;-)

I'll keep you posted on other, more spontaneous
events at the Museum too.  Hope to see you!

Airhowlingly yours, 
    Erik.
