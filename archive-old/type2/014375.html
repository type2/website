Hi, Yes we have everything for it- all poles, etc. I don't have a scanner so
I can't send a picture but it is gold and blue and the floor is grey! It is
in great condition. We are in Louisville, Ky. and are asking $400.00  plus
shipping if we have to ship it!
Thanks!

&gt; Hey, how much do you want for it?  Is it all there (poles &amp; stuff)?  What
&gt; part of the country?  Let me know and I'll pass it along.  If you have any
&gt; photos you can scan &amp; put up on the web that would help a lot.
