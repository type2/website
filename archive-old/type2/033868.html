&gt;Mike:
&gt;A big hammer will move the same things as a 10 ton press.
&gt;Heat and a hammer in the right hands will do a lot. (It will also booger
&gt;up a lot if  you don't know what you're doing. I know this from
&gt;experience.) :^(
&gt;Glad you got your ball joints in successfully, though!

Al is 100% right I was going to mention it myself, impact is an impressive
thing, does what continuous force can't even imagine, something about
mass acceleration and conservation of momentum and all.
Big ole hammer can do it pretty well usually and as you seldom are saving
the ball joints, doesn't ususally matter if you just want the eccentric off.  If
you do leave the nut on but put it all the way down just flush even with the joint
that way you tend not to smear the treads or do them incredible damage, but
they are fine and can take a hell of a whump anyway.
