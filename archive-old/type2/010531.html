Hi All,

I have a 1972 Westie Campmobile with a rebuilt engine (rebuilt to 2.0L).  
I think the engine is a 72 (ID # is CB 051435).  I've
had it timed several times by the same shop and the last time, I asked them to
mark the timing position so that I could do my own timing.  When I saw that 
the mark showed timing to be 10 degrees before TDC, I was perplexed because the
front counter guy at the shop said correct timing should be 5 degrees after 
TDC, which I verified in Muir's book.

So I took it back yesterday just to have them verify the correct timing and they
changed it to 5 degrees after TDC, telling me that the distributor is stock so
this should be correct.

The bus then drove like s**t.

I took it back today and asked them to look it over and they said again 5 degrees 
after TDC was correct and that the Bus drove OK.. It did NOT drive ok.  I had no
power in any of the gears, had a hard time getting to 50 mph and could not
maintain that speed on a hill.

OK:  the counter guy told me today:

1.  Nearly all busses will run better if you advance the timing
2.  To do so is probably bad for the engine and shouldn't be done
3.  My bus is running normally when adjusted to 5 degrees after TCD (as I 
said, this just isn't true)

Questions:

1.  Would optimal timing be when the vehicle runs best, regardless of what the 
&quot;book&quot; says to time it at?
2.  Could setting the timing which results in the vehicle running best actually 
damage the engine?
3.  Could the conversion to a 2.0L engine cause the need to change the timing 
from &quot;book&quot; to something else?
4.  Might this shop itself have caused the timing to have to be changed when 
they changed the jets in the carb (dual) which they did several months ago (as 
a matter of fact, today the counter person said, &quot;Well, yes IF we had changed 
the jets in the carb, for example, THEN maybe the timing MIGHT have
changed&quot;--forgetting that they had indeed changed the jets)
5.  Should I change shops (I feel like I was getting a lot of bs from the shop 
(as in when they timed the engine a month ago and set it to 10 degrees before 
TDC and didn't tell me that the setting wasn't &quot;stock&quot; and when they sent me 
off into the wild blue yonder with it set as &quot;stock&quot; but running very poorly)?
6.  What would be the factors which would cause you to set the timing different 
than the book says (the shop tells me by the way that there is NOTHING wrong 
with the distributor or the vacuum advance in my vehicle)

Thanks,

Dale G
