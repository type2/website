&gt; The profile on pre '71 buses require ramps to slope upwards very gradually
&gt; in order to prevent nose or tail hangup, I think.

I don't think that buses would have any problems more than other cars.

Ramps work well, but remember you are still making the vehicle more
unstable than when it is sitting on flat ground.  Use due consideration
that the ramps are sitting on a flat, level, hard surface, because if they
tip you will be in a world of hurt
