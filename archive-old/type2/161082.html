&gt;checked the archives and only found references to gasoline that was

How much gas are we talking about? If you've got a tank full where will you
dump it?

Add some fresh gas to the tank if it's only been sitting 6-8 months.

&gt;is my gasoline bad or still usable?

22. How long can I store gasoline without it going bad?

&quot;Gasoline stored in a tightly closed container in a cool place will stay good
for at least one year. It is better if the container or fuel tank is almost
(95 percent) full. If the container or fuel tank will be in the direct sun or
will be heated above 300C (800F) much of the time, add an aftermarket fuel
stabilizer to the gasoline when you first buy it. Gasoline-oil blends for
two-stroke cycle engines stored under the proper conditions will keep as well
as gasoline itself.&quot;
