Subject: Thanksgiving Misgivings 1

Hi all just wanted to see who was thinking about going to this event in SC I 
am planning to come down from NJ but would like to know what kind of turn 
out there was going to be as this will be the longest trip me and Magik have 
taken since she has entered daily life I am new to the Full Moon Bus Club 
and would like to see a nice large turn out, the more the merrier as they 
say. Although even a few buses in one place is always a nice thing to see, I 
am going to be traveling with my girlfriend and her 3 yr. old (future 
bushead) and would love to see his eyes when he sees a whole bunch of buses 
in one place. I know it is still a ways away and we still have Octoberbus 
(can't go, work) but thought i would start the thread early to up the 
excitement.
