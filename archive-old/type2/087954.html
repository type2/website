Subject: heater cables

     Thanks to all who gave suggestions.  I got the old heater cables out by
cutting out the crimped section.  I then tie wrapped the sheath to the
torsion tube.  I had to buy a Dremel tool that made the cutting easy.  I
should have bought one years ago.  I am going to see if I can make some kind
of split tube to clamp in place of the cut out piece.  I did accidentally
crimp the left heater cable right at the end where it hooks to the lever.
Not sure if it is going to work properly.  I may have to buy another one but
it will be a piece of cake this time.
