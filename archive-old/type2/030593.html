Subject: 71 westy dimensions

Hey kids,

I'm looking for the rear interior dimensions to a 71 bus. I'm trying to
find a westy and i plan on putting in my own interior (i know, but i'm
planning a LONG trip, and besides, i'll keep the westy stuff i promise)
anyway so while i'm searching for the right bus i'd like to sketch some
interior plans. i had a standard 71, so i know what it cargo area is like,
but it's been a while and my idea of scale has distorted. if anyone has
some deatailed late model bus plans on file that would be supercool,
otherwise if anyone has a 68-71, a little time and a tape measure i'd be
ever-so-grateful. 

thanks
andrew 

ps. if any of you are wondering what happened to the People's Press site,
well it moved to http://www.sfo_dot_com/~android currently it is in a state of
disarray, but i'm working on getting it alittle more up to date. now that
i've moved to CA, i've been getting back into vee-dubs so hopefully i'll
be updating the site more often than before.
