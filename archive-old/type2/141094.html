Don,

What year is your Volvo? Early to mid-80s 240s were notorious for poor
insulation of the engine wire harness. Over time insulation will break,
individual wire may shorten out, and eventually it will go up into smoke
(when one of the unfused wires to the starter or alternator wears through).
I had this happen on a '82 240 wagon. My '87 wagon was fine though.
Aftermarket replacement harnesses are available for around $100 or so - just
do a websearch. Takes about an afternoon to replace and is absolutely no
fun. Your non-functioning O/D may be an indication of things to come. But do
it before you really get stranded and need AAA or the fire department ..

Marcus
