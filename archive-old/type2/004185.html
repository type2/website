   Hi All. I finally have the Contraption back on the road and I'm in search
of a locking engine hatch latch:) . If anyone has one with a key for sale
please let me know and how much$.
I'd like to go the used route as I can't see paying 60$US(&gt;100 Can. ) for a
new one!!!
I also in my repaint of the engine bay,lost the catch for the above latch. I
made one from sheet steel for now but would like the proper one.
Thanks
