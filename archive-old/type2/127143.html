Subject: Re: [T2] Westy/Camper flooring questions

&gt;      First question, did the campers have a plywood sheet layed over the

&gt; thick of a piece is this?

Mr. Ollom,

A while back I had the sad experience of &quot;parting out&quot; a mid-70s (74-75)
westfalia.  The interior was in good condition and very originl but the
frame was rusted beyond saving.  I did examine and salvage the floor
system and as I remember it was composed of two large and two small sheets
of a fiberboard that were aproximately 13mm (1/2&quot;) thick. These boards
were not plywood but rather softer and made of compressed fiber, possibly
coir from coconut husks. Over this was laid a sheet of masonite and then
the finish vinyl floor.

The fiberboard subfloor was cut to fill the &quot;well&quot; created by the raised
edges of the sliding door rails.  You could obtain a measure of the
thickness needed to fill this depression by laying a straightedge across
from door to wall and measuring to the top of one of the raised rails.  As
I remember the subfloor and floor did not extend under the bench seat but
I may be wrong on this as it has been some time.

                             OOK!
