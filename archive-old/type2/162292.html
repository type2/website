Brian,

Lots of this in the archives as well, but Farmers Insurance offers 
what you want...you may haveto have an appraisal to get it, but they will 
do it.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Can anyone tell me what insurance company they go through and if they have 
 insurance for full replacement value? My insurance company will only insure 
 for blue-book value which is close to nothing.  I have called every classic 
 car insurance company I can find on the internet, (even RV insurance) and 
 they all either have mileage restrictions or won't insure air-cooled 
&gt; vehicles or even campers.
&gt; Thanks,
