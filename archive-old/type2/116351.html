Subject: Gear shifting trouble

All

Just a quick one.  I am having real trouble shifting gears - into first and
down from third to second (keep getting forth or reverse.)

need to adjust (tried briefly but did not make any difference - can try
again of course) or do i need a new linkage part?

play is about 50mm in each gear and 100mm in netral.  i do not have to push
down to get into reverse.

Thank you!

Ben

ps - will give an update of my 'full throttle sxitch' problem that karl has
been helping me with soon.
