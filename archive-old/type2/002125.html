Subject: (OEM) cranking amp of my 1600'cc T2 starter ?

ello folks,

I'm reading the battery FAQ of the library right now and i wonder how much
the of the Cold Cranking Amp (CCA) rating of my battery is (i know that it
is an 70amp battery) and how much the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
cranking amp of my 1600'cc T2 starter is. I guess my battery has an output
of about 120-150 amp for cold cranking. Don't know how much my starter
needs, cause it's definitly not enough!! When i charge the battery (It's
new!) my engine cranks one or two rounds and then the starter seems not to
have enough current to spin well. It stops and turns just half around...
Well i gotta admit that there's no longer a 1600 in my bus, i swapped it to
a T4 2000. How much is the OEM cranking amp of a T4 starter? Is there any
diference? I guess i gotta get a new and bigger battery or something...
cause the starter is ok, well at least i hope so... I checked it and it's
ok, no short circuits and stuff so i think it might just be the capacity of
my battery. Also it's a Brasialian one so i won't trust too much in it.
(Don't tell me to get American ones, i can't! I live in Paraguay...)
Please help, after 3 months of engine and tranny rebuild i finally wanna
turn on this engine. Otherwise i guess i'll get too pacient and won't ever
more jump into mudbaths with my bus.

Thanxs

Michel
