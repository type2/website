Subject: Tach Questions

I was at my FLAPS today and looked over the selection of tachometers. Can
anyone tell me what size the clock mounting hole is in a 74? The
off-the-shelf tachs came in a variety of sizes; the pertinent ones being
66mm and 85mm. They are both made by Sun-Pro. Will either of these fit
without serious modification?

Opinions, facts and wild conjectures solicited.

Thanks,
Dave
