&gt;2) where is the best place to install a bilge blower, up towards the front,
&gt;or back by where it Ys off, by the  engine??
I put mine in between the cargo area and the front right where the long
tube ends.  It lasted about a year there before it melted.  Any further
back and it would have melted the first time I used it.  Any  closer and it
would be so loud you wouldn't be able to talk to your passenger.  Where I
mounted it is still a little loud.  The next one I get I am going to look
for one made of metal if possible.

&gt;3) Having done these modifications, and with good heater boxes and good
&gt;door rubber etc. are you seeing    way better heat ?? or is there just a
&gt;little improvement ??

Trust me just with the bilge blower and the heater system sealed I can't
hold my hand over the vent for over 20 seconds before it starts to burn.
It pushes out so much air it will blow your hair back.  I actually only
used it for a few minutes at a time before I turned it off, got too hot,
but it only gets to be in the 20's F around here.

With out the bilge blower I couldn't even defrost my windshield.  No
prolblem now.

Peace

Jeff
