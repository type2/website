Subject: Re: Child's Hammock

Michael,

Thanks for the quick reply about my hammock question. Do you think the older
style would work on my 1976 if the black tubes were cut and a larger tube
fit over them to bring them to 56.5 inches length?  I'm also not sure but the
canvas for the old style looks shorter by an inch or so. Maybe I should not
mess up the orginal old style hammock.  Any thoughts?

Thanks again to all!

Jim

&gt; Hi Jim,

&gt; VW/Wetfalia changed hammock styles around 1974 or so, you need the &quot;newer&quot; cot 
&gt; with the adjustable &quot;U&quot; channel poles (easily identifiable and the fact that 
&gt; they are finished in a glavanized finish) as opposed to the &quot;older&quot; black 
&gt; painted round tubed poles that you got. If it is any consolation it is a common 
&gt; mistake.

&gt; m.




&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; VW folk,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I found a child's hammock at a junk yard from an early 70's camper. After
&gt; &gt; getting it home and doing a fit check in my 1976 I found that the poles
&gt; &gt; were both about 1 inch too short to fit in the '76 mounting hooks. The 
&gt; &gt; hammock poles are both 55.5 inches long and the mounting hooks on my 1976 
&gt; &gt; Westfalia are 56.5 apart. Does anyone know what is happening here. The hammock 
&gt; &gt; poles are round tube steel about 5/8 inch in diameter with mounting tabs 
&gt; welded
&gt; &gt; on each end. The tubes are painted balck and the canvas is a brownish green
&gt; &gt; color.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Are the early child's hammocks different than the later (1976) types?
&gt; &gt; Any comments are appreciated!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jim
