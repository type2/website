jessica-
make the adjustment at the master cylinder push-rod,
for faster pedal, just make it longer to take up the slack,
and leave some small amount so the pedal disengages.
better to replace that bleeder screw now so you won't
have to do it on the road later. it's so much easier when
 they break down in the driveway...
you deserve some brakes today !
