Subject: How High? ...a picture..

I thought you'd be able to see what I had going on here, but I guess
not.  Still a good photo to share.  I had my jack stands on top of a
three or four 2-8's that I had cut into squares and screwed together
for some extra height.  I also had the same on top of the floor jack to
lower the engine.  This was my first engine drop, so I wasn't sure how
high I had to go.  Good luck!
