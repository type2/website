I own a '79 2.0 Fuel Injected Westy. Recently I had a sudden fuel leak out
on the road.  It was a lot of gas and only leaked when the engine was
running.  I got home before it started a fire but I am having trouble
figuring out where it was coming from. It seems to be coming from inside
the gas tank compartment, but after taking the panel off I can't tell what
might be the source.
	Could it be coming from the sending unit somehow?
	Is there anyway to fix without pulling the engine?
Thanks in advance.
