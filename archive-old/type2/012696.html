Subject: Comments on searchable archives, CDs, etc...
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Volks:

I also subscribe to the 914 mailing list (Rennlist)
and they have also been kicking the idea of selling an
archive CD around.  I posted this message there and
I'll post it here as well.
-----
Seems there is some serious concern about copyrights
and intellectual property and the like.  There are
plenty of arguments for and against selling an archive
CD.  My personal feeling is that I signed up to an
internet mailing list and posted stuff to hundreds if
not thousands of people with the intention of them
reading it.  If somebody wants to make it easier for
people to find answers to questions and possibly cut
down on repeat postings than I'm all for it.  Of
course there are always a few um, people, who feel
that their words mean more or are worth more than
others.  It's those people that initiate lawsuits and
stir things up.

How about an &quot;opt-in&quot; situation where people would
give you express permission to publish their posts. 
People that don't &quot;opt-in&quot; would have their names and
emails stripped out.

Before anybody flames me (I can't afford Nomex) I'd
like to state that I'm all for the idea and would buy
a CD in a heatbeat.  I just don't want somebody else
F'ing it up for the rest of us.
---
I have to add that I used the i405 archive search
heavily.  If I had the disk space I would have kept
all the posts I've received over the years.  I've been
subscribed to this list and it's ancestors since '93
or so.  If somebody else has all those posts I'd love
to have a copy of them.  I'll build my own search for
personal use and won't tell anybody.
