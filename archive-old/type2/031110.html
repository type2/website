&gt; Before I trouble shoot the dirty way, I want to make sure its not a fluke.  
&gt; The red battery light is flickering, and sort of (low) glowing.  When the 
&gt; turn signals are activated the light brightens and returns to normal once 
&gt; off.  It doesn't come on for anything else.  Today it started flickering at 
&gt; low rpms and quit on the highway.  I thought oh great another day down, but 
&gt; it went away after about 8 miles on the interstate and didn't come 
&gt; back,(except for turn signals).  What gives shouldn't it come on for all 
&gt; electrical draws and accessories?  Any advice would be appreciated.  I 
&gt; already know how to trouble shoot manually just curious.

had the same problem, drove me nuts, took about 2 years to find it.  turns
out it was a bad fuse, had very high resistance,  #11 or 12 I believe,
near the right side of the 78 fuse block
