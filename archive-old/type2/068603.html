I also found a locking engine compartment latch at a junkyard.  It was from a
68-71 model so I knew it would fit my '71.  I brought it home and removed the
locking cylinder portion (the portion the key fits in separated from the
latch assy).  I took that to one of the locksmiths that work out of their
vans (not vw, sorry) outside of a junkyard.  The guy was able to open the
sealed cylinder and re-key the thing so my original bus key fit.  Charged me
$15 and said the cylinder was a bear to get open.  He said as long as your
original key fits inside the key hole, he can change the tumbler so your key
will work.  It's great, I now have one key that fits every lock including my
ignition.  My paranoia factor goes way down when I lock it.  I do however
drive with my engine compartment unlocked in case I need to get at my engine
in a hurry.

Different thread: why was painting you bus root beer brown so popular in the
'70s?  same reason as cut wheel wells?
