Subject: RE: $4000 is not enough (was major engine problems)

Assuming you have a few spare parts around the garage, I'd say that $2000
will often do just fine to acquire a good bus. This is from experience in
1996.

$ 150  1971 type 2, blown engine, body and tranny in reasonably good shape
$1300  NEW engine
$ 300  tires
$ 250  other sundry parts (brake shoes and pads, registration, other stuff)

The key here, of course, is to find somebody with an otherwise good bus
but no engine. They are out there.
