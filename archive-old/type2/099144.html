Subject: Re: [T2] HELP! rear end droning noise

You should jack the rear up,, and spin the wheel.
If you have a bad bearing, it will sound different side to side, so compare the
noise on the left side to the right,,

try to wiggle the tire top to bottom.. compare the amount of wiggle to the other
side of the vehicle

&gt; (70 westy) driving home today, got to about 35MPH and i started hearing a
&gt; droning noise from the back somewhere. driving under this speed doesnt
&gt; seem to cause the noise. cant tell if it is coming from left, right or
&gt; center. braking didnt seem to change it. letting off the gas seems to
&gt; lessen it or make it go away, from what little i was willing to make it
&gt; do.
