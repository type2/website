Subject: batter tray replacement.

If you dont want to weld or use mech. fasteners you
should
look at auto panel adhesive. very strong yet remains
somewhat flexible ..unlike JB weld. JB weld works
great
in a compression join that doesnt need to flex but
drys rigid.
  The door hinges on the wife's 90 J**p Cherokee (long
gone now) were &quot;welded&quot; to the frame with this type of
adhesive. Lasted 9 years or so. When the driver's side
door
got tweeked I went to grind off the &quot;weld&quot; bead as I
was going to take it to the weld shop and get it
fixed.. Much to my suprise it was adhesive.. I dont
think the door hinge was a good choice for using it
but it is pretty
strong stuff...
