I don't really have time to answer you either, but what the heck.

&gt;I'm puting a 74 1.8 L in a 72 Westy.
&gt;-Is the 74 alternator compatable with the 72 electrical system?

Yes.  It's the same alternator that's in the 72.

&gt;-Are the alternator and generator interchangable?

See above.

&gt;-Since a change may have already been made , how can I tell them (alt.&amp;
&gt;gen.) apart by loooking at them?

I've never seen a generator in a type IV motor and I can't think of a good
reason why anyone would want to put one in anyway.  The alternator will
have Bosch written on it somewhere... hmmm... and an alternator will have a
wire for the field whereas the generator won't.

&gt;-Where exactly does the Ground (-) from the battery connect to the frame or
&gt;engine?

It connects to the body of the bus right in front (FIF) of the battery
tray.  I believe there is just a bolt that screws into the body.

&gt;-What solvent can I spray onto all these greasy push-on electrical
&gt;connectors so I will get a good connection?

I would try carburator cleaner or brake cleaner.  Be careful, the stuff's
flammable.
