Subject: Shift rod bushing?

Hello,

I am about to replace the front shift rod bush. I have disconnected the 
shifter, the coupling (underneath the van) and removed the rubber boot at 
the entrance of the tube that the rod travels through to get to the tranny. 
When I removed the boot I did not see the old bushing, maybe it has fallen 
apart and gone further back?. How far back should the bushing go from the 
entrance of the tube? Can I slide the new bushing on and push it as far back 
as I can, will this work?


Thanks in advance, Phil.
