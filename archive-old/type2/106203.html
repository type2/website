Subject: Everybus Pics

Heidi and I had a great time at Everybus. It was worth the 8-hour drive (each
way!). Next year we'll leave a day earlier (have to miss some school, much to
Heidi's chagrin) and we'll bring 1. more art supplies for the kids, 2. an
awning to keep out of the rain, 3. a winning vegetarian chili recipe!

All-in-all, we had a blast. The inclement weather only lasted a couple hours
Saturday morning. The rest of the weekend was fabulous. Check out the pics
here:

P.S. Is anyone else interested in starting a 'Father-Daughter' group area at
future campouts?
