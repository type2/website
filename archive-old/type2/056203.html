Subject: Refrigerators

I've seen a lot of questions on the list about refrigerators ( installing, repairing,etc.) What I use in mine (non-deluxe) is an Igloo refrigerator that runs on both AC/DC. I plug it in to AC the night before,so it gets cold, then load it with drinks, food,( helps if they are already cold too) take it out to the camper and plug it into the cigarette lighter. When you get to a campground, you can switch it back to AC. If found it works great, but obviously would'nt do if you're camping where there are no AC hookups. Cost about $125.00   Jeff
