Rust through, maybe...Another list I'm on (Morgans), reports header failure
(cracked flanges, etc.) from the coatings...Seems the coatings retain too
much heat. Same with the various &quot;wraps&quot; that produce the same heat re-
tention failures. Stainless seems the best long term solution - but even 
then it's not forever, just longer.
