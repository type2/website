Subject: Bus Haiku: Another Silly Friday Idea

Hi Volks,

I just got this in from another bus list I'm on, and since it's Friday 
I had to share.

&gt; My fuel pump, a Haiku
&gt;    By Adam
&gt;
&gt; Falling leaves on hatch,
&gt; The smell of gas flows through me
&gt; Rebuild or replace?

Anyone else want to share some culturally uplifting prose today?

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
