Subject: Bay Area- nice boxes/fun stuff/cheap engine analyzer

        Volks,
        RA Enterprises, a surplus/junk store at 2260 De la Cruz Blvd
just outside the northwest boundry of the San Jose Airport, has some
stuff that I thought the list might find interesting. They bought
a bunch of S2 Tracker spare parts and maintenance stuff recently,
and my beloved brother nailed the neatest item of the lot,
a 0-4500rpm Dual Needle tach. Needs some kind of sender, not just
coil-primary (since magnetos for starters..) but beautiful to look at!

        They also have a couple of Bendix Scintilla spark-ignition
analyzer scopes. I bought one for $50 and we're researching how to
set it up for use on VWs. Mostly vacuum tubes, which doesn't
scare us. The analyzer is built for dual/multiple (up to 7
according to the switch) magentos on a twin engined airplane. 
A large cable connects the 14 magento inputs, and a smaller cable
connects to 'Vibrator' and there's a third cable to connect to 
generators 1, 2 and 3. AND AC power (115V, 60Hz, not 400Hz). Pehaps
another cable or two.
        A big dial on the front is marked 1-x-x-x-2?-x-x-x for the 
ignition sequence of a 9 cylinder 4 stroke. The knob within is calibrated
from 0 to 700 (0-720 degrees) and marked &quot;IO&quot;, &quot;IC&quot;, &quot;EO&quot; and &quot;EC&quot;
which we take as valve operations- it must be a moving trigger marker
so you can select a given cylinder at the center of the screen.

        Anyone have experience connecting such a beast to an automobile
engine with breaker-points and coil instead of the dual magnetos of
the R1820s that S2s came with? What's &quot;Vibrator&quot; mean in this
context? All my books are packed :(

        They also have some neat aluminum boxes with handles, many latches
and rubber seals containing various items of test gear for S2s. $22.50
each, (Everything's half-price this week or at least since Friday last...)
Clean out the test gear and you've got a nice metal box for storing tools
or supplies. Use the test gear switches and lights to ammuse a child
or someone acting like a child, or where lights and switches are best used. 

        This stuff was constructed in the 60s, so I suppose the paint 
probably has lead in it, but they sure are neat- and we taxpayers paid 
for it so we might as well enjoy. Each test box comes with matching mil-
circular connectors and cables for connecting to the airplane- neat if 
you're wiring something complex and want a bomb-proof connector. 

        One of the T boxes contains little dial-indicators calibrated
in grammes and a very obscure fixture that connects them to something.
What? Guess I need the manual! All cables provided, but no manuals.

        All this stuff is deep in the store, near the x-ray machine. 
Go in the front door, walk forward until you can't go any further, turn
left. Go down the aisle until you get to the middle where the clock and
the big asile are. Turn right, and then turn right a second time and
you're there.

        For bonus points, find the S2 deicer boots on a shelf in another
part of the store. For double bonus points, find a use for one in
your bus! Lots of wires, cables, and electronic hoo-ha for those so
inclined.

        Cheers!
        Bill
