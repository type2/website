Subject: RE: Heater controls

If it's a Type 2 and has three levers working in a vertical plane then -

The red one to the right is for the heat supply. When it's up, the heat 
supply is off and when it's down, the heat supply is more or less  off. This 
is in Winter. In Summer, when it's sweltering, this lever ceases to function 
and there is a steady trickle of superheated air blowing around your feet or 
your face.

The red one in the middle directs air to the windscreen or to the lower 
vents. When you want to defrost or demist the screen, a steady stream of 
moist air will make either problem far worse.

The blue lever to the left controls fresh air. When it's up, it's off, and 
this means that in Winter there is only a steady, chilling draught from the 
eyeball vents. In Summer, once your speed is up to around 70 mph, then the 
lever can be pulled down to allow a gentle breeze of sticky ambient heat 
into the cabin.
