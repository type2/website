Emily,

Welcome back!  I haven't been on the list quite that long...only since 
about 20001.

Here are some pics of my 78 Champagne Edition that I restored....maybe 
that will provide some inspiration?

Good to see you back!

Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; Hi all.
&amp;gt; 
 I was active on this list in 1996-1998.  I am trying to not be chatty to
 comply with list charter but I would love to hear from any of you who
 remember me.  I figured a Friday was safe to post an intro...  Please email
 me privately if you remember me.  My last name used to be Hanlon - I helped
 create the type2_dot_com site way back when and there is still a credit to me on
 the credits page which is kind of amazing!
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; I have a 1978 Champagne Edition Transporter, which I had repainted and
&amp;gt; reupholstered and customized/modified in 1994-1997, mainly in Tampa,
&amp;gt; Florida.  I was in college in Wisconsin after that and am now in

snipped for brevity
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Well, I'll be hanging around reading messages for a while until I decide
&amp;gt; what to do.  If anyone knows Daniel Morris I would love to get in touch with
&amp;gt; him.
