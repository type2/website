Subject: Rubber seals / sliding windows

Hello everyone, I haven't posted in a long time, but have been keeping
up with the Digest.

This last weekend, while replacing my carb, I decided to inspect the
metal fuel line and fuel hoses from the fuel pump to the fuel tank. 
Well, it turns out that the metal fuel line was worn almost all the way
through at the firewall.  In the past, I would reach in the back, felt
the grommet there, and thought that I must be okay because the grommet
was there.  Big mistake.  I immediately went down to the hardware store
and got all the parts for the Hoover fix.  It is now installed, along
with new metal line, and new hoses.  I feel much better now.

In my 1971 Bus, the vent wing windows on the slider and opposite the
slider are falling apart.  The frames are rusted.  I originally intended
to remove these frames, remove the glass, and have the frames blasted
and rechromed.  But in my research, I am finding out that the seals for
these vent windows are no longer available, nor likely to be available
in the future.  The condition of the present seals prevents me from
reusing them.  So I would like to replace these two windows with sliding
windows from a 78-79.  From the archives, I have found out that these
sliding windows will fit in my 71.  What is the general feeling on the
list about these windows?  Do most people like them?  Do they tend to
leak?  The rubber seal for these sliding windows is the same as for a
solid glass window, right?  Also, anyone got a set of these sliding
windows for sale?  I am considering putting in louvered windows as well,
if the sliding windows prove difficult to obtain.  

All of the rubber seals on the bus are getting hard and cracked.  There
are black streaks down the side and back of the bus from water running
over the seals and down the side.  Is there some kind of sealant I can
apply to the seals to prevent further deterioation?  I intend to replace
them all eventually, or at least the ones still available.  I used to
see busses at Dead shows where the windows were epoxied in. Used to make
me shudder.  Now I am beginning to see why they did that.

In response the the &quot;Where are you&quot; thread, I am in Upland, California,
about 40 miles east of Los Angeles.  A few miles from the site of the
Pomona Swap Meet.  If anyone needs driveway camping space, or whatever,
let me know.

thanks,
