&lt;long description of starter woes excised&gt;

&gt; How common is it for the ignition switch to go bad? If I still have a
&gt; starter problem in the future, it seems like that is my only remaining
&gt; part to replace. And replacing that sounds like an expensive PITA.

After my lovely wife got stranded twice in the last month due to the
infamous 'hot start' problem, I was forced to investigate and fix this
weekend.  I had already ordered the electronic part of the ignition switch
from Bus Depot ($10.95 I think), and having suspected the ignition switch I
decided to replace it first.  My estimates for repairing things on the bus
are always woefully low (as my wife can attest), so I refused to give her an
estimate on this one.  So while she cleaned the bus, I went about replacing
the ignition switch.  Took me an hour, and that included disassembling the
connectors for wipers/turn signals and cleaning them before re-assembling.
Only gotcha was the headless pinch bolt that I addressed with a small flat
screwdriver hammered into the already drilled center hole.  Replacing the
switch fixed all my starting problems, and I discovered a probable reason
why the original switch had gone bad:  PO had decided to lubricate his
ignition switch with motor oil.  This oil has quickly seeped down into the
electronic bits and gummed up the connections.  I'm still at a loss to
explain why it would consistently fail when it was hot, but this fix worked.
