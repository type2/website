Subject: Re: [T2] some bad AP3 cams out there

yes it is a type 1 built on a new aluminum case. he has talked to his 
supplier and they think the only other ones shipped went to a dealer in tn. 
(vols beware). he told me he has been using these cams for a long time with 
no such problems.
&gt;
&gt;Assuming this is for a t1 engine since I haven't heard of those cams
&gt;since the early 70's?

&gt; &gt; I had a engine built by a local shop. we installed a AP3 cam. it went 
&gt;flat
&gt; &gt; and the grit distroyed all the bearings and the crank in 900 miles even 
&gt;with
&gt; &gt; 3 oil changes. the owner has had all three of the engines he built with 
&gt;his
&gt; &gt; last shipment of 5 cams(he still has 2) come back.
