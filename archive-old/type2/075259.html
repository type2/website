Subject: Re: [T2] oil cooler? and gasket?

See if you can supply a part number.
I've got several good coolers that fit the 2000cc type four, not sure if
they fit 1600cc.
I also have several junkyard sources if you are patient.

&gt; Well. I just found out that it was not the oil cooler gasket that was 
&gt; blown,
&gt; but the oil cooler itself.
&gt; Does any one have one? 1600DP
&gt; Thanks
