 From this post, I guess I am announcing to everyone my return from 
being away for a month in Trinidad and then St. Croix.

Anyway, now the Houston weather is right for some serious bus work, and 
I want to get started on a few issues.

A couple of questions:
Oil pressure gauges and Oil temperature gauges.
Mounting in a 1970 Westy using the clock hole

First off, I would like to monitor both parameters, but given a choice, 
I guess I would go with pressure as the most important !?  Correct 
??  Comments ??

Now then, given the clock hole in the dash, what is the best gauge 
model # to go with for either oil pressure or temperature ?

Now then, bigger question yet..................
Does anybody out there make a dual function gauge that fits in the 
clock hole so as to allow for measuring oil temp and oil pressure at 
same time??

Thanks for reading,
Bob in Houston
