&gt; Access Responded:
&gt;got the same results a lot easier, when you crawl under the bus and put a
&gt;screw driver accross the terminals, well I wired a switch between the
&gt;small contact (can't remember the number.) and the battery.  hefty switch
&gt;but no relay.
&gt;

The post I placed which had the first schematic on it was in response to a
starter which didn't want to... A situation most of us have experienced a
time or two. I got an additional year out of my last starter when I
installed the relay. And Yes I have been on my hands and knees and on my
back in the mud (I live in Western Washington) shorting out the small
terminal to the B+ battery on the starter to make it work.

A stout switch will certainly work, but the idea I was trying to get at was;
install the relay to increase reliability (IMHO), which most bus owners
reading this list are enthusiastically concerned about. The installation of
the switch in the engine compartment was to compliment the relay and add
benefit to the installation. Being able to rotate the dizzy just a touch
without getting a wrench out, or checking for spark using the switch is
really handy.

In the factory installation, the 18 awg wire which is connected to the
starter cannot deliver the necessary amperage when the starter solenoid and
bushings start to wear. That is why the assistance from a rap on the starter
motor with a wrench or shorting out the terminals with a screw driver will
by you some more time. Muir wrote a bit on this in the 'idiot' manual and I
can tell you, reading that saved my butt when I was dead in a parking lot
the first time it happened. Never leave home without the idiot guide.

One final word; When you install the relay and start using it, those &quot;wonder
if it will work woes&quot; go away, but further down the road when the starter
decides it doesn't want to work any more, that's all she wrote.
