Subject: Re: [T2] Upcoming Road Test: Konis, Hankooks and Bar Harbor

&gt;But when I replaced those with
&gt;the B-D's 185R14C Hankooks, every little crosswind blew me into the next
&gt;lane.  Frankly, it was a terrifying experience and I have been driving Buses
&gt;since I was 16 yo, which is to say, a pretty long time!  
 
Before I put my Konis on I had KYB gas adjust shocks front and rear and I 
never experienced that with the Hankooks at proper inflation. 
 
 The Konis do make all the difference, I really do enjoy them.  I set mine to 
full soft in the front and I did a turn in the rear to firm it up.  The ride 
is just fantastic, but I would like to get a larger sway bar up front to 
complete the package.
 
Hope you have a great trip and I know you will enjoy the ride!
 
Kris
