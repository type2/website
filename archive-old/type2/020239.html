Subject: heat pipe info for all, interesting find!!
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

The heat pipes are indeed different. The parts suppliers are incorrect
saying they are the same for 72-79 for those making the conversion make
sure you get the pipes from the earlier year system check out
http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t202410.gif

Thanks to Nikki for helping me out and leading to this discovery!
