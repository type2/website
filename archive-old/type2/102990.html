&gt; &gt;&gt;one of the things that I really wish that my 78 had was intermittent
&gt; &gt;&gt;wipers, I have seen aftermarket kits for sale, has anyone gotten any
&gt; &gt;&gt;experience with any of these????
&gt; 
&gt; There is a GOLF or JETTA relay that you can just plug in that has a custom 
&gt; timer built in. Something like you turn on the wipers and then off and then 
&gt; after the period of delay you want you turn them on again and they will 
&gt; wipe at that delay. It is variable for a wide range of time. I have the 
&gt; details if anyone wants them.

details details details, of course I want em!!

thanks
