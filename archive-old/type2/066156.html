I recieved lots of good help with my bus numbers but still in need
of identifying my motor. It appears to be the original, it did not look
like it had ever been out. But due to the bus and engine sitting for
such a long time outside who knows. It has the govenor on the intake.

The number is 0300727.

I would like to know what the c.c. is and approximate manufactored date. 

If any where info can be accumulated it is this list.

Thanks in advance - Terry
