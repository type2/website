I have some stuff I am cleaning out hoping it will go to someone who will use 
it.

--set of two bugpack fabric stack aircleaners.  one unopened, one not.  both 
never used.  part #1519-11  2  5/8&quot; dia.   $10  for both.

--2 orig. oil shocks.  fichtel &amp; sachs
                               s  26 x 235
                            28 1700 794 031
                                $10 for both.  ( used once, owner (me) didn't 
like them and     then bought gas shocks instead.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------
--98%turn-key engine.  #8 282 782 (early 1964 single port) has all tin, heat 
ex. (perfect condition), heads, generator, etc.  was sitting outside for 
unknown amount of time.  it is missing  carb and muffler.  i admit it is 
rough..but it is cheap. $50.

i got it from a friend who owed me money.  that's all i know.  $175 ( thats 
what he owed me when we traded...maybe i got screwed, i'm not sure...)

--alternator 12v..50amp.  checked out yesterday, does work.  cant get a nut 
on the pulley end of it ( think someone mushroomed it)..if you can fix it, 
its yours.......$5

*note..i want this stuff to go at a lower than reasonable price.  i hope i 
have succeeded.  if you could really use some of this let me know and i will 
adjust the price.  

* i will be travelling to waterloo, IA this weekend (monday 6/14) to pick up 
a motor from a fellow listee.  if it is on the way and one of you would like 
i can bring one/ more of the things listed here if you are in my direction of 
travel.  (omaha, ne.  to   waterloo, IA)
