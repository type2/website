Subject: Re: Two Wheel Trailor Sale!!

Jerry/Melissa,
	Up on the playa last year I met some folks that had a folding two
wheel trailer that they towed behind their non-westy vanagon to bring
their yurt and camping gear. It folded just aft of the axel so it could be
stored vertically.  When placed vertically behind their van the tow bar
was hardly over the roof line as I recall.  It looked practical for the
size loads I would feel comfortable towing behind my van (not too big) and
would be out of the way when not in use. Does anyone know where these can
be purchased? jon
