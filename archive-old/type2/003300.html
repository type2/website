Hello,

I thought I'd mention that I just spent a couple hours cleaning the fan on
my 1700cc type4 engine. It was black and covered with a hard, crusty grime.
Seemed to me that a clean fan might help the bus run cooler. I used engine
degreaser, steel wool and any implement I could find nearby that would go on
top and under each fin.
