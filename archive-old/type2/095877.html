Subject: Aux Oil Cooler install...results Aircooled vanagon

Yesterday, I finally had a dry day to install my auxiliary oil cooler =
from the Bus Boys.  This was a very solid unit, and cost a little over =
$100 including mechanical thermostat, sandwich plate adapter, and =
lines/fittings.  I bought some Rabbit radiator mounts (thanks vw mags) =
to mount the cooler on. as well as some 90 degree fittings.  I used a =
Hayden, Inc.  transmission oil cooler fan in addition to this that i =
found in a junkyard for free (this fan really puts out the air!)

It took me about 4 hours to do, for i did not have much room to =
work.......The time consuming part was finding a good mounting place and =
actually mounting.  I mounted above the transmission just behind where =
the engine tin stops.  I wired the fan so that it turns on when the key =
is on, and off when not..........I was going to do a toggle switch, but =
knew I would forget one day to turn it off, so came up with this =
instead.  The oil cooler is large, about 12&quot;X10&quot; and 3 &quot; thick.....made =
of steel, so it is solid.


here are the stats.  Before the cooler, if i went 70-75 mph in my part =
of the country (humid, and 90+ degrees out side) for any length of time, =
my oil would hit 110C and probably hit 115C.so I had to go more like =
60mph.   My oil pressure would be more or less equal to my rpms(3800 =
rpm...38psi) and my heads would run between 300-350f.

Now, And i drove ti hard yesterday, my oil temp is around 90-95C, heads =
275-325, and oil is up about 5-10 lbs...........is this awesome or what? =
 Definitely one of the best mechanical things I have done to my van.
