Subject: Re: [T2] Is my engine supposed to idle down over a period of
  about 15  seconds?

Hey Courtney,
Make sure that your dizzy is clean and your advance mechanisms (vacuum 
and spring) are both functioning correctly.  I had a dirty advance plate 
that was causing my idle to stay high.  Have you rebuilt your entire 
dizzy lately?  It can do wonders...

Mike
