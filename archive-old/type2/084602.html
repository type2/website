You must verify spec timing and mixture before going futher.

&gt;I seem to be having a problem with overheating in my '72 Westy. 1700 engine
&gt;with
&gt;than 20 - 30 minutes and it got so hot that the rear bumper was hot to the
&gt;touch.
&gt;I checked it out after it had cooled down and the flaps are working
&gt;fine (right
&gt;side wide open and left side down over the oil cooler when warm) and all the
&gt;tin and
&gt;seals are in place.
&gt;
&gt;What could my overheating problem be? Could it be associated with my other
&gt;problem - high idle? The engine idles very high. I tried to take it down
&gt;some, but it
&gt;seems to reach a point at which it either idles high, or not at all.

Then verify no vacuum leaks. Sounds like you have a loose hose and your 
running lean.
