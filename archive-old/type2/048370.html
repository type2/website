Heat?  Heat?  We don't need no steeenking heat!
Wrap yourself in blankets and pile in back...its wonderful sleeping weather here
now.  We (the DBG) just had a campout last weekend...last year at the same
campout we had snow.  I have no heater in my bus...and I slept wonderfully...in
a regular sleeping bag with one blanket on top.  Of course in WI... 40 degrees
is t-shirt and shorts weather... :-)
If you get a chance to swing down through WI... I live in Oshkosh... stop in!
I'll introduce you to some of the local bus guys.
Bring a jacket though... heat on a VW may seem excellent when the outside air
temperature is 60 degrees... but its not so hot when the outside temp is
30...unless your heating system is really nice.

&gt; 2. If I dont find anywhere to crash in the aforementioned cities, do you
&gt; folks think I would be okay sleeping in the bus? I have no source of heat
&gt; once that 1600 is shut off, but I have plenty of blankets. I have never
&gt; travelled up through the midwest before, so any advice would be appreciated.
