Was flipping around channels today, can across charlie and the choc.
factory.  It was near the beginning, saw several beetle (about 5 or 6 -
one without a rear wheel fender), about 3 bays (two white ones and a
green) and 1 splitty (blue).  Also, there were several old bmws.  Just
thought it was cool, must have been filmed over in England.  Saw no
license plates to confirm that, though.
