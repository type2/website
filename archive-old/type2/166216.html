Subject: Re: [VB] Eating clutch cables...help ?

Thanks for all the tips guys.

The first time the cable went (probably just down to age) I had to call 
out a garage as I had my baby with me and couldn't fix it on the road.  
It snapped at the tranny end.

I recall the AA guy removed the small lever from clutch pedal end and I 
guess he's gone and put it back the wrong way as I've snapped three at 
the front end since then.

I'll get under tomorrow and take a look!

thanks again, I'm pretty sure this will be the problem.

Lee
