O.k.,

Thank's for reading.  Here is a free pointer to start
off with.  &gt;Always inspect your oil before you
rebuild. Even if you are only pulling the motor to
change the clutch, because you may decide to go ahead
and do a top end rebuild like I did.  

Well, I got the engine back in and all together, and
went to drain the oil. (It has not been run yet.) 
Brass shavings.  Lots of 'em. 

They are chunky stepped spirals, some tiny(50 pieces),
some the size of a  small ant (10 pieces), smooth on
one side and chunky-stepped on the other.  Under a
magnifying glass, one of them looks a bit like Sy
Sperling.  Then there's the  grandaddy, a piece about
1/2&quot; long x 1/16&quot; square. It looks like it might have
been from a collar, but I haven't seen a bearing up
close, so I don't know.

Other than low compression, the engine ran fine
before.  I didn't notice any odd noise, and other than
some small endplay movement in the flywheel crankshaft
bearing, I didn't notice any problems. Endplay was
.01&quot;, I got it down to .005&quot;. The bearing was a doing
a little in-out dance, but not alot.  The rod bearings
seemed O.k.

I no longer have the facility to tear the motor down
again, so I'm in a pinch.  But I don't want to court
disaster, either.  

Answers to any of the following questions will be
greatly appreciated.

What is this most likely from? 
How does it happen? 
What occurs when a crankshaft or camshaft bearing
fails?
What is the possibility of driving it as-is?  
Has anyone driven thousands of miles under such a
condition?  (I have a hunch that If I had not pulled
the engine, i may have not noticed it for some time.)

Thanks ,
