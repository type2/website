Subject: Carver (aka Propex) propane heaters

The other day, Ron Van Ness and I were having a conversation offline
wherein he was expounding on the merits of the BN4 gas heater.  I
mentioned I'd read Chris Gibbs' post a month or so ago about Propex
brand propane heaters available from a company in England, and had
written them but hadn't received a response.  I liked the compactness
of the Propex heater, but the BN4 had authenticity on it's side as well
as not having to mess with a separate source of fuel.  Well, Ron, you
almost had me sold on the BN4, and Propex (now Carver &amp; Co.) must have
sensed it because I got a brochure in the mail from them today.  :-)

So now I'm back to being undecided again!  Their Sales Executive is on
vacation and is supposed to contact me, but in the meantime they sent
a one-page (front and back) brochure showing two of their models, the
Compact 1600W and the 2600W, which put out 1600 and 2600 watts of heat,
respectively.  Could someone give me an idea of how much heat that would
be?  Chris wrote of the 1600W model (approx. 14&quot;x6&quot;x4&quot;, the 2600 is 14&quot;x
5&quot;x8&quot;) being entirely adequate even for Alaska, but this MUST be a
different scale or measurement than, for example, a 1500W hair dryer
(which I doubt would do much to heat my bus).  How much would 1600 watts
be in BTUs?  How many BTUs does the BN4 put out?  Other specs. (FYI) are
as follows:

                    1600W                          2600W

        24VDC     1A continuous running          2A continuous running
Air Throughput    45 CFM                         75 CFM
Fuel              Butane or Propane gas          Butane or Propane gas

                  37 mbar Propane                37 mbar Propane
Gas Consumption   113 grams per hour             155 grams per hour
Dimensions        360mm L x 160mm W x 100mm H    360mm L x 120mm W x 200mm H

changed from Propex to Carver &amp; Co.:
