Subject: 72 Campmobile for sale

The header says it all.
I loaned a buddy the cash to get this camper and then he hosed me on the
deal. Now I own a 72 camper and I really want a splitty. Even if you don't
want to buy it look at it and give me some kind of an idea what it's worth or
maybe I should keep it and fix it up.

It's at http://users.aol_dot_com/my65notch/bussale.htm

Thanks, 
Dan
