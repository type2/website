Subject: RE: [T2] Homeland .... now cold great white north stories

Umm actually my heater bit the big one.. no heat until I can afford
to stick a propane furnace in it.. next spring im hoping.
However.. even when my 78 had one, &lt;let me tell you a story&gt;
I drove it all winter.. I had a 1400 km trip to see  my kids
and the temp got down to -38 celcius. The wind stripped
the heat out of the bus faster than it could make it.  That
was the coldest time I have ever had. I was in a fully insulated
set of coveralls plus covered up in an old army sleeping bag.
Luckily the kids didn't have to come back with me. I also
had one of those black cats running at my feet as well

My SO laughs at me when I remember it. She talked to me
on the cell phone and couldn't understand what I said since
my teeth were chattering soo bad. Too much air space with
too much surface area for the wind (snow storm - gusting),
to strip the heat out.

I always say never again, but that wasn't the last time.
Ok, nuff thinking of past idiotic times.
