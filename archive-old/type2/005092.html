Subject: Top Dead Center for TypeIV Motors?
Message-ID: &lt;009b01be9645$5f989ea0$07918ad1_at_18.41&gt;

Hi,

This is based on a 1972 1700cc CB series motor

As a understand it (PLEASE TELL ME IF THIS IS WRONG) this is the way to find
it on a typeIV motor. Remove the little plastic cap on top of the fan
housing. Look straight down in there (a little flashlight helps) and you
will see an upside down V shaped notch  in the center just above the
top/front(FIF) of the fan. Rotate the motor (make sure it is in neutral and
the wheels chocked) clockwise until you see a black line appear in the apex
of the upside down V. At that point your motor is at 5 degrees before top
dead center.

Why VW made a mark a 5 and not 0 is a mystery to me. There is also a red
line on the fan that is very close to the black line.Muir says to ignore
this line. I am curious what it is for. Anybody have the answer to that?

Now that you know your motor is a 5btdc you can mark the outside of your
pulley at the 5btdc mark using the handy timing scale. You now have a fixed
reference mark. Pop the top off the dizzy and if the rotor is pointing at
you #1 is at top dead center.

My bus has that funky plug for the VW computer diagnostic system. Is there
any way to make use of the circuit that VW had to find TDC with the sensor
on the flywheel?
