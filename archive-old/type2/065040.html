Subject: smoke test

     Lea and I pulled the motor again on the '63 single cab and installed 
     the missing firewall tin.  While out we did some more cleanup and 
     fix-up: replaced the bent old crank pulley with a new degreed model, 
     installed new axle boot, installed the original style air cleaner, and 
     set the choke for easier cold starting.  Everything went well and when 
     Lea got in and cranked, it wouldn't start, coughed a couple times but 
     no start.  While she cranked and I fiddled with the carb I smelled the 
     smoke.  The ground cable from battery to body was the culprit.  Right 
     at the body.  That end was bright red, as was the body around it.  I 
     had wanted to replace when we first got it but neglected it for what 
     seemed like higher priority items.  I just didn't look good, some 
     fraying, bad connector, and the presence of PO electrical tape, a sure 
     sign that I ignored.  
     This a.m. I discussed this with a friend at work who doesn't know VW's 
     but is an electrical wiz and after discussing the importance of 
     cleaning the offending area for proper ground, I described in detail 
     how I cleaned it a few week ago.  He informed me that it was a bad 
     idea to spray the parts with battery terminal goo before installation. 
     Do it after install, he says, otherwise the goo prevents good contact. 
     I intend to clean again, install new cable and then spray.  I'll 
     report but in the meantime all opinions on this subject are welcome.
