Subject: Re: [T2]  RE: Question replacing injector seals....


&gt;Finally, there are places that will tune your old injectors, as Beth
&gt;Mathis posted.  I like this as an idea very very much.  The price she
&gt;quoted ($25) is only a little less than new ($38 from Dave Bolen's
&gt;source), but I think that is immaterial. I think I would prefer tuned used
&gt;to new.  The spray pattern on injectors is critical and a known good,
&gt;tested, tuned injector ought to last just as long as a new one with
&gt;slightly better surety that the pattern is right and that no one dropped
&gt;it on its nose in the store and is selling it anyway.

And by buying new you still have a second set (your old set) if you need a 
backup injector or two temporarily or you could trade them off to somebody 
else.
