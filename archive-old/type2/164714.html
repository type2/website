Subject: Vanfest photos

Vanfest this year was amazing. Bigger than ever with loads of vans in the 
showground and in the huge car parks. If you didn't go you missed out.

I've put a load of pictures up at:
http://www.flickr_dot_com/photos/45131642_at_N00/sets/72157601950990245

Take a look and please add comments !

You can read more about the show at: http://www.vanfest_dot_org/

Hope you enjoy the pics.

Thanks

Phil
