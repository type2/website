Subject: Money pit (was once upon a pre-owned tuna can)

&quot;Money pit&quot; is a relative concept. If someone buys a bus for $500 and 
expects to drive it regularly with no more than a couple of hundred 
dollars in repairs, they'll soon discover they have a money pit on 
their hands -- in their terms.

In a way, this makes no more sense than going to a car dealer, buying a 
financed vehicle, and then grudging the payments as they come due every 
month. That's a money pit if you think the $2000 downpayment was all 
you needed to spend. But if you're aware that there are monthly 
payments, the phrase &quot;money pit&quot; does not apply. (Waste of money, 
maybe, but that's a different phenomenon.)

To be even more direct: buying a bus and then being surprised about how 
much money and time it takes is _exactly_ like financing a car and not 
paying attention to what the monthly payments are going to be, or how 
many months it will be financed.

There are a finite number of things that need to be done with every bus 
if they haven't been done by a previous owner. Finite means &quot;not a 
pit.&quot; If they are done right, with good parts, as systems, then they 
are done until they age and fatigue. After that, it's just upkeep.
