Subject: Gas tank outlet nut

Dang,

My aluminum gas tank outlet nut stripped.  Of course, it is after I installed it and the engine and trans.  I must have banged it whilst painting it.

Does anyone know the thread size/pitch for this.  I am wanting to chase the tank threads before I reinstall a new one (assuming I can find one).  Also, I cannot remember, is there a rubber gasket, or some kind of gasket there, I know that there must be, but I am not remembering, nor finding my old gasket.

I looked in the archive for this info, alas, I was not there.

Thanks,

Bob H.
