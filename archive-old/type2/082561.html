Subject: Re: [T2] tires once more/decision time 

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; OK, after many helpful list responses and calling around to my local shop
&gt; and the tire companies, it looks like my main choices are thus:
&gt; 
&gt; Michelin Agilis61 in 185R14 at about $120/tire.
&gt; 
&gt; Continental CR21 reinforced (load range C) in 185R14 at about $80/tire.
&gt; 
&gt; Yokohama Y356 in 185R14, price unknown (anybody want to let me know?)
&gt; 
&gt; Kumho Commercial A/S 852 in 185R14C load range D, price unknown.

	&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; As it is I'm very strongly leaning toward the Michelin but the price on that
&gt; Continental is looking pretty decent.  Is the Michelin really $40 better?

I'm really happy with them.  They ARE a pretty penny, but do very well
in Mud and Snow (read: Mt. Shasta bus trip), although they aren't
much for ice -- then again, what is?

That said, I should qualify all of that by saying I haven't necessarily
seen them cut down on the effects of crosswinds as much as I had hope
to, however, this is a hard thing to quantify -- how do you compare your
old tires in a x-wind to your new tires?  It's all very subjective.  I
*think* I've noticed an improvement over my passenger-car tires, but
I *am* still effected by x-winds -- go figure, I'm driving a bus.

hope this helps,

	tom
