Subject: Re: [T2] generic cd in a bus question 


List,,
    From the personal experience files.....
Yes a cd player will work in the angle of the dash, just make sure that you
secure the rear of the cd player with the little brace they give you with
new ones...(if not it will skip every bump you drive over)  I have  been
very happy with my cd player, pioneer, but other players may have differnt
angle requirments.  Good luck, and i recomend the four slits and bending
method of making the cd fit in the dash.

&gt; i think i remember a conversation i had when getting my cassette deck
&gt; together. i think i was told compact disc players needed to be parallel to
&gt; the floor for them to work properly. given the angle of the hole in the
&gt; dash, a cd player would never work in a bus.  do cd players work at that
&gt; angle?  - steve
