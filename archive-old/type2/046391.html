Subject: [T2] 59 Kombi

I found a 59 kombi to purchase for 1000.00 bucks.  it runs and is totally 
stock original.  It was found in the Washington State Desert and has been 
parked since 69.  the owner that is selling it to us bought it about 4 years 
ago and has replaced/rebuilt all the brakes,wheel cylindars,  master 
cylindar, fuel pump, fuel tank.  But pretty much it is still in the original 
condition.  He is throwing in a bunch of parts including a clutch plate, 
cables, ect.

the compression is low at 75, 95, 84, 79.  Obviously it needs a rebuild.  I 
believe then engine is a 1200 36HP single port.  The owner stated that the 
parts are hard to find to rebuild that motor and that it might be better to 
put in a 1600.  He just kept saying its a 36 HP motor.  Aren't they all 36 
hp before late 1971??

I'd rather keep it stock and try to rebuild what is already there.  It will 
not be a daily driver and we are gonna restore it and resell it as we have 
too many vw's already and just want a fun winter project.

So are those engine internal engine parts hard to find or does anyone out 
there have one to sell??

Does it sound like and OK deal for 1000.00??  The body of course is surface 
rust but NO HOLES!! :)

Is there any parts on that that are extremely expensive or hard to find that 
I should check for before we buy it?

can't wait to cruise around in such an old bus!
