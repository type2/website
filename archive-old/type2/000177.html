Subject: '77 and '78 Buses for Sale or Parting out
Message-ID: &lt;0.da1de8dd.254e7f66_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I'm losing my storage and need to sell 2 buses asap.  Both buses are located 
near St. Louis Missouri.

1977 Champagne Edition.  Automatic with air.  Engine is out and missing one 
head and a couple of misc. parts.  I believe all fuel injection parts are 
there.  This bus is restorable and I have a good title.  Check the URL for 
photos and email me with any questions.

1978 Hawaii Bus.  Automatic with air.  Engine is in and has not been started 
in about 3 years.  I don't have a good title, but do have the original Hawaii 
title and registration.  This bus is for parts only, as the title was never 
filled out properly and I can't and won't try to track down the PO.

Both buses have lots of good parts and both have good front beams.  My plan 
was to make one good bus out of the two, but my mechanic closed his shop, and 
I don't have the time or room to tackle this job myself.

I will part these out and ship smaller parts.  Both have good automatic 
trannies, but I won't ship these.  You pick up or make arrangements.

Pmail with questions or part requests.
