Volks,   I usually save the wire from the factory seat, straighten it by
pulling it over a rod that I secure in my vice then bend a small hook in one
end of the wire. Then without removing the string from the new seat cover I
tie the aftermarket string to the hook and pull the wire through the seat
cover.  It has worked for me many times.
