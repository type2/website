for those of you that may care.......

Went back and got it started, it ran fine of course, sitting seems to help, i
guess more gas seeps its way through or something.  Anyway, as soon as I get a
chance i'll check the tank filter, try and replace the push rod, do a little
dance, sing a little song, make a little love, and basically just get down
tonight.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions and help, i'll let you know when I do this
junk and the results.
