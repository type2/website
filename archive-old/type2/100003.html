Subject: rear end droning noise-me too

--I've got this sound on my 79 T4 also. Rattling at higher RPMs. Sounds like something vibrating, coming loose, but I can't seem to duplicate it at idle so I can see/hear it.

Billy

&gt;tailpipe rubbed on the rear apron. the thing is, whether the car was
&gt;rolling or parked, if you revved the engine, the tailpipe would vibrate against the body at certain RPMs... this noise isnt like that.
