Subject: Re: [T2] dent in pushrod tube opions requested

Hi Guys,

You may not have to replace the tube if you can repair it. What I do  
with a dented tube is to grip it gently in a pair of channel-lock  
pliers and press a deep socket through it that is sized within 1mm of  
the tube diameter. This will press the dent out from the inside and  
restore the tube to within spec dimension.

This may not work if the tube is sharply creased or corroded, but if  
not then it's possible to get many more years of good use from the  
repaired tube.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

as long as it isnt leaking and isnt affecting the push rod then you  
will be ok till you get it changed but i would change it as soon as  
you can if the dent is really bad...
    mine have some dents but nothing major and nothing affecting  
anything... longs there is no rubbing or leaking...IMO
