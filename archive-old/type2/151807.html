Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling bay window gas tank

Mike,

Welcome back!

I've almost done it....

You can see some of the pics here...

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/

I think I got to the point that it was just far easier to get it in and 
out with the engine out.  

Especially when it comes down to reattaching/replacing the hoses and 
filler tubes.  Bite the bullet and just &quot;do it&quot;.&lt;grin&gt;

*check the archives*

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; 
&gt; 
     Haven't been on the list in 2-3 years. Just signed back up last night.
 Still see a few familiar names.  I've had the gas tank out of a few different
 buses over the years, but I've always had the motor out when  I've done it in
 the past.  I'm working on a 79 right now that has a dirty tank that needs to
&gt; be cleaned and sealed up, and I really don't want to pull the motor, its brand
&gt; new :)  I think with the Fuel injected motor I have enough room to sneak the
&gt; tank out over the engine, but before I try I'm curious to know if anyone else
&gt; has ever done this before?  thanks in advance
&gt; Mike
