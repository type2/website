Subject: parts vendor question

All good info. Thanks for all of your responses. I was
contacted about putting a link from my site. Smelled
fishy
to me as most of the time I add sites based on good
things
said on this list or some other sort of
recommendation.
  At any rate, didnt &quot;feel right&quot; and they wont be
added.

Thanks! Dan
