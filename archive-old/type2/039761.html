Subject: Re: Generator dilema...

&gt;  You might be able to pull more current with big
&gt;  audio amps, but if the draw is continous the sound level will be such
&gt;  that you won't be able to occupy the bus unless you are between the ages
&gt;  of 14 and 18!

You know our kids!!! &lt;giggle&gt;  Hey, us parents sometimes aren't much better!

&gt;  Of course, extra capacity doesn't hurt, but the stock bus generator is
&gt;  more than enough for my needs, even with several amateur radio rigs and
&gt;  a stereo adding to the load.

Electric heaters (space and H20) do... I'm thinking of the former for mine.  
As do 110 converters.  I thought of either figuring aout a way to do up a 
tiny generator and mounting it under the back seat, vented to the outside, or 
doing a 110 alternator, tho that's a bit much!  I like the idea of extra deep 
cycles under the back seat (where the charger is anyway!!) and enough 
inverter to run the TV and my laptop.  

Lights, too.  Not the westy flourescent, but I had a couple 20W outdoor 
lights to light up outside and &quot;upstairs&quot;, and they *did* drain pretty well 
(I like to read at night!).

Hmmm... Now all I need is a coffeepot and a microwave! &lt;grin&gt; In 12 Volts!
