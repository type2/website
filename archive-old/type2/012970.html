That's what I thought, and it's why I was a little freaked by the fact that my &quot;old&quot; 009 is 90 degrees off the SVDA and the old 205Q (71 DP bus) DVDA dizzy.  That is, the 
rotor alignment is different (WRT the driving dog) by 90 degrees.  Don't know if the #3 retard is also shifted.

Either way, I think I can keep up with heat issues with my CHT and oil temp gauges - at least monitor diffs from previous setup.
