Subject: What does a Bad CV sound like?

I'm getting a loud clunking sound from the general area of the
transmission. It's hard to say if it's from the sides (CV's or not).
It's only there when I'm rolling and in gear, if I push in the clutch
it's gone. This sound only appears occasionally , sometimes when I'm
turning and sometimes when I'm downshifting and sometimes when I give'er
some gas. It's got a definite rythym that increases as the wheels turn
faster. Any ideas?
