&gt;&gt; Has anyone ever put a type 4 (72 and later) engine into a pre 72 type 1 Bus?
&gt;&gt; What is needed to mount it in the Bus?

&gt; Unless you have a good knowledge of metal working equipment including
&gt; welding, fabricating the needed parts and replacing the sheetmetal will be
&gt; very difficult.
&gt; 
&gt; The rear &quot;frame&quot; that is under the sheetmetal at the back (your bumper
&gt; attaches to this frame) is wider after '71 so the wider type 4 engine will
&gt; fit in there.  I don't know if you would have to widen the frame, but you
&gt; would have to cut all the sheet metal out of one bus, then weld it in the
&gt; other, then fabricate the mounts for the engine brace.
&gt; 
&gt; You can figure at least 40 to 60 hours to do a decent, workable job if you
&gt; have done this type of work before.
&gt; 
&gt; A lot of work.  Not worth it in my opion.  The type 1 engine will work fine
&gt; and your resale value will not drop.

Let's make this easy, convert it to an upright, use the type I conversion
info from Joe Cali. The rear type IV engine mount is easily adapted to the
narrow width of the early type II frame. Just drill the three mounting holes
after narrowing the mount from the outside ends. Transmission should be
swapped at the same time. Be sure to utilize the hangers on the later
transmission by cutting the old hanger supports from the later bus and
welding them onto yours. (Again not much of an issue.) Tire size may be
slightly different, but hey. Bigger is better. I would not even consider
&quot;adapting&quot; a flat style engine to an upright engine compartment. Especially
given the advantages (cooling and otherwise) afforded by the upright
conversion. If you are worried about resale. Plop the old engine and
transmission on a pallet and store in your garage. The only item you welded
on was the hangar support from the old van, which can easily be undone.

I was told the same thing. Then I read up on the upright engine conversion.

Have researched this for my 68 campmobile, and in the process of making the
big conversion.
