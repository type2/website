Subject: Re: [T2] If it ain't broke ...

Well, Barry, my unrebuilt 246K engine still runs like a champ, but also 
blows oil, mostly out of seals if I go faster than 55-  but the real 
clue I am really due for a rebuild is the oil temp and the oil pressure. 
  Do you have a gauge for pressure?  I assume the mains are worn and 
pressure when hot (230) is only 20 at highway speed and with a VDO 
gauge, lights up at idle (under 7 lbs?).  Compared to daughter's newish 
75 bus, the oil temps are hotter when we are following each other as in 
the Westies in the Woods Campout- I presume this is due to a dirtier 
engine and lower pressure through the oil cooler.  The plan is to have a 
rebuild done on another case I have, hopefully when I can pull the heads 
on a pair of parters and determine what is best to rebuild.  The I will 
liesurely pull this apart and see how worn it is.
