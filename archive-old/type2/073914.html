check the archives for full info.

but this is the infamous vent tube leak.  there is a vent tube running
from the gas tank to both intake air ducts, as they make the turn to go up
into the duct there is a small flexible fitting, this wears out and needs
to be replaced. use a small piece of fuel line hose.  it is almost
impossible to see but reach up into the area behind the spare tire well
and feel around for it, the tubing is maybe 3/8 inch in dia or so

&gt; i recently sold my 85 vanagon, and purchased a 1976
&gt; westy. everything has gone pretty well so far, except
&gt; that i am having problems with my feul tank. first i
&gt; noticed that when the tank was over half full, gas
&gt; spilled out(the bottom) of the passenger side of the
&gt; vehicle whenever i made sharp left turns at speed. so,
&gt; i took it to my local vdub shop, and they discovered
&gt; that part of the feul filler system was rotted out. as
&gt; luck would have it, a part that is no longer
&gt; available. however they patched it with epoxy. i
&gt; figured, great the problem is solved for now, so all i
&gt; have to do is salvage this part and im set. then just
&gt; last saturday i was at the gas station and filled my
&gt; tank, i came out to discover a puddle of gasoline
&gt; underneath the drivers side of the vehicle. i popped
&gt; the engine lid and to my dismay saw gas running down
&gt; the inside wall(and coming out the bootom of the
&gt; vehicle). what the hell is going on here!!!???  if
&gt; anyone has any insights i would appreciate some leads
&gt; and or solutions to this persistent problem. thank
&gt; you.
