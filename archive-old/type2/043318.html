Subject: For Sale...72, Weekender

Hi all...Well, its time to put the bus up for sale...We now have a m*t*r h*me (no flames please) cause we had to have a bathroom etc...It's a 1972, weekender, (the one with the full width bed)  1800, single weber, in fairly good cosmetic shape (only a little rust on the bottom edges etc.) BRG (that's british racing green) bottom with a white top.  It's in good mechanical shape and has been very reliable.  I'm asking $2000 Canadian , and I'm located in Kimberley BC (about 4 hours drive North from Spokane WA)
Contact me here at shado_at_rockies_dot_net for more info.
