Because the bearings in your engine use Babbit, aluminum, and other
nonmagnetic metals, the magnet would not collect these particals.
However, if your oil pump, cam/crank gears, or other steel parts start
to shell out, it would pick up some that made it past your filtration
system. On a Bus with stock or aftermarket spin on filters, I would not
expect to see a great benifit from them. The upright engnes with out
the filters, may gain some benifit. I don't know where to get one, but
I think that there is a magnetic drain plug made for the VW. It would
serve the same function.
