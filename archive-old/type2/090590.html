&gt; Nope - that would violate conservation of energy.  Can't get something for

I think the statement was imprecise.  enlarging the input pulley would
make the pulley system more efficient (less flexing losses) than shrinking
the output pulley.  You would still need more power to run the fan, but it
would be transmitted a bit more efficiently.
