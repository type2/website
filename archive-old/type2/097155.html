Subject: Couple of more &quot;Westy&quot; questions

Hi there:

#1) My '81 Vanagon has large rubber seals on the leading edge of the doors
that match up to &quot;holes&quot; (roughly rectangular) in the chassis which serve as
part of the fresh air system.  On my '82 Westfalia the passenger-side setup
is the same, but on the driver's side the seal is missing and the hole in
the chassis is blocked of by a plastic piece that looks original, held in
place by a singe screw.  I guess this serves to shut off air flow on this
side, but I have to ask, &quot;Why?&quot;  Is this some sort of &quot;camper&quot; setup?  Can I
simply remove the plastic piece and find and install the rubber seal, or am
I screwing something up?

#2) The small metal piece that serves as part of the door latching system is
loose, meaning I can't really shut the door tight.  Looking at the similar
metal piece on other cabinet doors it looks like it's held in place by a
single screw, but I can't figure out how to get at that screw in the refer.
Can anybody provide guidance?

TIA.
