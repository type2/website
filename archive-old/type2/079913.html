&gt; Bus content - anyone currently use American Collectors Insurance for
&gt; their
&gt; bus?  They only want $51/year to insure a $3,000 bus (agreed value)
&gt; with no
&gt; deductible, $300k liability, comp, collision, etc. and the only
&gt; restriction
&gt; is that it not be a daily driver and no more than 2500 miles per
&gt; year.  Maybe I can afford to keep a second bus after all... ?

&gt; I checked on this, and it is not offered in my home state, MA. Does anyone
&gt; know of a service like this available in Massachusetts?

The Texas Department of Insurance recently proposed rules that would allow
insurers to voluntarily offer mileage-based auto rates, that might save
money for low mileage drivers.  It is a pilot program. Sure wish we had it
in California.
