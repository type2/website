Subject: dangers of a front mounted spare (Myth busters)

Hi there:  I posted this suggestion on the discovery myth buster website.
There was already a suggestion to do it.  I offered up my idea.  Here is the
link.  I think if we get more involved, they might do it.

I can tell you that I hit a deer in Teton National Park in my Dads 82
Vanagon and it glanced right off the Drivers side. It damaged the whole
front end. The deer and I saw eye to eye on that encounter.  Not fun and Dad
was not happy.  Since it was in a NP, I had to alert the Forest Rangers,
plus being a Park Employee that summer.

&lt;&lt;Myth-busters should do a show about this topic. They could use Buster
again and see how he fairs.&gt;&gt;

I like the concept Adam---

This would be a good episode---

Who do we write???--: )
