When my husband and I go camping and pop the roof up, we sleep with our
heads towards the front of the bus.  The window zips open for air and there
is lots of room for two people to sleep up there leaving below,  for the
table to be set for breakfast and our gear stowed in our side tent.  For
more head room in the morning we just flip back the bed, blanket, sheets and
pillows all.  It is a great setup, I just love it.
