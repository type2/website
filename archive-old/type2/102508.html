&lt;&lt; Folks, can someone please describe to me what this class means?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Best Unrestored-------All Years &gt;&gt;

If it's used in the same way as I've seen at other car shows; it means
a very good all original vehicle. The word 'patina' is used a lot, too...
To describe that 'look' an old vehicle gets with good/excellent care
but still driven. A lot of old racecars are being shown in this class...
with all the wear and tear that actual racing inflicts on a car...The
opposite end of the concours spectrum from something like a Bug-
atti type 57 that's been taken down to the bare chassis and every
nut and bolt replaced
