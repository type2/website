&gt;They were available! At least back then they were, because I actually
&gt;considered them but gave it up because they were &lt;very&gt; expensive, like
&gt;around 300.00, if memory serves. I don't think it was Scat, but someone
&gt;was cutting them on a CNC. They were billit aluminum, very squared off
&gt;and bulldog looking and beautiful, almost too good to cover in oil and
&gt;hide under a valve cover.

We might be talking about two different things.  I think you're referring 
to roller rocker arms.  Those are part of it, but I also want hydraulic 
roller lifters, i.e. like regular hydraulics but with a little wheel on the 
end that rolls over the cam lobe.  With these, you can run cams with much 
steeper ramp rates and higher lift and not worry about wear.  To run roller 
lifters though, you have to have a mechanism to prevent the lifters from 
rotating in the bore.  This would almost certainly involve major 
modifications to the case itself and some new parts, but it would open up a 
whole new world of engine longevity and performance.  Like fuel injection 
and electronic ignition, roller lifters are now (I'm pretty sure) in the 
majority of new cars sold in the US.  I want them in my bus!

I did a google search on &quot;roller lifters vw&quot; and found some indications 
that other people have thought about this in the past (Gary Miller, Pauter 
Machine).  I wish I had a fistful of cash to throw at one of those guys.
