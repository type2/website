&gt; Can anyone recommend  a good leak-down tester?
&gt; The only one I've been able to find is at harbor freight for $59.99.
&gt; Any suggestions?  Searched the archives but didn't seen any specific
&gt; brands/models.
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
Mine's Snap-On, but since I got it at a yard sale I can't compare the
prices but only assume that it's multiples of $59.99... ;-(
