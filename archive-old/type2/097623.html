&gt; &gt; I posted a couple days ago about an apparent pressure drop after
switching
&gt; &gt; to Mobil 1 oil. Those readings were takem during my usual 10 mile
commute to
&gt; &gt; and from work. Tonight I had the opportunity for a little road trip,
about
&gt; &gt; 50 miles on the Parkway. After about 40 minutes running at 55 - 60 over
&gt; &gt; gently rolling terrain I can officially state that Mobil 1 SUCKS!!!
&gt; &gt; Absolutely the WORST oil pressure readings across the board! Oil temp
stayed
&gt; &gt; in the normal range, maxed at about 220; head temps were also normal.
The
&gt; &gt; pressure dropped to about 25psi at 55 mph, and for the first time ever
the
&gt; &gt; oil light came on at idle.

&gt;
&gt; my mobil 1 in a recently rebuilt engine (10,000 miles or so) and at 220
&gt; temps at 55mph it goes no lower than 45psi, and so far the oil light has
&gt; not come on, in fact about 25psi at idle

&gt; 2 liter FI stock except for pertronix

&gt;
&gt; That light comes on a 7psi IIRC. Isn't there a bigger problem?  I guess
the
&gt; Kendall will confirm it...let us know.


This is a 74 1800 with manual trans. The engine has about 22K on an AVP
rebuild. This engine has performed wonderfully for me at all times, always
starts instantly, climbs hills well, drives through the midwest heat and
humidity with no troubles, and does not leak or consume even a drop of oil
between changes.  I had the Kendall 20w50 in it before changing to Mobil 1
and had much higher pressures at comparable oil temps and driving
conditions. (The exact same driving conditions, in fact.) So, should I worry
about my engine? Would a compression test be in order? Some other
diagnostic?

Dave
