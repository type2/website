Subject: RE: [T2] thermostat

The mechanic in Livermore, Ca who built my engine (lawsuit pending and he's
out of business now) ignored my request for flaps and thermostat, claiming
that they aren't needed in the balmy Ca climate.  Still I insisted and he
said he would do it.  What a flippin' liar.  4,500 miles later, I'm
installing a new engine.  What I discovered is that, among other atrocities,
he used an aftermarket 36 hp shaped doghouse fan shroud.  I didn't know the
difference in shape until three weeks ago.  You can't put the flaps in this
shroud and it has no internal vanes.  Look in the mags and you can always
find the round 36 hp doghouse shrouds cheap.  OK for a beetle, but bad news
for your brick-shaped bus.

I just got my flaps and thermostat from Joe at BustedBus_dot_com for about $80 I
think.  Joe has saved my bacon before with these harder to find parts.  He's
working on a new connecting arm as we type but the one he sent me works
great.  I got the correct fan shroud from list member Karl (aufever).
