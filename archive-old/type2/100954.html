&gt; Ill agree. The come-along is a nice tool to carry in a camping bus that goes 
&gt; exploring.

I agree and have the come along, but I have about 50ft of chain rather
than the strap, curled up in the bottom of the storage bin built into the
bus, they got me out of a snow bank late one evening some years ago, so
they have paid for themselves
