Subject: Re: Rough when cold(was newbie Q's)

&gt; I did say that my van(82 Westy) was running rough when cold.  Here are the

&gt; details: first it starts right up every time but then the idle fluctuates
and 
&gt; it comes close to dying but doesn't.  When I take off there is a
hesitation 
&gt; in each gear until the rpm's get higher (I do not have a tach so I don't
have 
&gt; any idea what the actual rpms are)
&gt; So...where should I start looking?

As a matter of course, you should always check for vacuum leaks first, your
most likely culprit. Then go through the online FI troubleshooter (see sig
below).
