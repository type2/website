Could you bleach them out in the wash and then re-dye them another color?

I always thought you did this with the washing machine.

Probably need to get my wife to explain this part... Bet she knows more 
than me. (Wouldn't be the first time! &lt;VBG&gt;)

&gt;Hey Matt,
&gt;
&gt;I tried to dye my curtains, but with no success.
&gt;
&gt;The first time I tried a slightly darker RIT Dye.  All it did was generally
&gt;discolor the curtains.  Very blotchy.
&gt;
&gt;The second time, I went to a craft / fabric store and bought an expensive
&gt;professional upholstery dye.  Same results except that this time I spent
&gt;more cash and it stained the tub I used and my hands for about a week.
&gt;
&gt;Until later,

&gt;
&gt; &gt;     Realizing that this has been discussed at length in years past, I
&gt;would
&gt; &gt; love to chat up anyone who has SUCCESSFULLY re-dyed their late-'70's
&gt; &gt; curtains.  There were varying opinions on types of dyes and whether this
&gt; &gt; fabric will even take a dye.  Anyone actually tried it?  Thanks!
