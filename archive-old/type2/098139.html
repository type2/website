Subject: (correction) I need this tiny EGR part for an FI bus. Anyone
  have one???

Hello List,

Well, I have slowly been refirbishing the 79 (I
think)fi settup that I bought a few months back. After
arguing with myself, I have decided to go ahead and
install EGR on my bus. So far, I am missing only the
EGR filter and half of the linkage that runs from the
throttle body to the EGR valve. That brings me to my
request.

{{{{{{{REQUEST}}}}}}}}}}

 I am in need of the other half of the linkage. I have
the section that has the spring and I have the middle
threaded section. I need the half that is attached to
the throttle body. Does any one have one of these
lying around? I know that many people have
disconnedted their EGR so someone should have one. It
would also be great if I could get the 2 small c clips
that keep the linkage in place. Please email me if you
have this.

 I plan on installing everything up to the EGR filter
for now and just block off the end of the metal pipe
that connects to the filter. That way, when I have
saved up enough money after I finish the rest of my
engine, I can buy a new EGR filter and have an
opperational EGR system.

Thanks for your time. Your help is much appreciated!

Have a great day!

David Kelly
