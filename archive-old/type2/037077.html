Subject: Westy water tank question

Hello all,
My bus sat for nine years before I got it last fall.  The water tank under 
the sink was empty all that time, and I'm curious as to what I should do to 
clean/disinfect it before use.
I thought about adding a  little Chlorine bleach and filling it with water 
water and letting it soak for a while before draining it, but I don't want to 
cause it to get a CL2 odor or taste from this.
Has anyone else renewed a Westy water tank like this (I know some have) and 
how did you do it?
Also, is there a source somewhere for the basket that goes in the icebox? 
(1978)  Mine is gone and I'd like to get one.  Any repros?
Thanks,
Greg, and an as yet unamed '78 Westfalia. (I just the other day found where 
someone had named it 'Lunch Box' (with now gone stick on letters on the bug 
shield) in a prior life.  I just might stick with that.)
Moundsville, 
West Virginia--The rust capital of the world!
