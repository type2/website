Subject: Re: [T2] ATF in my fuel answers

If the pump is a replacement you might have the same &quot;problem&quot; that I did. 
It was noisy for a while and then with time got quieter and then silent.

I figure it was some manufacturing defect. I've never had any problems since.

I do not know the brand - just that it was an Auto Zone pump purchased by 
the PO to close the deal for us.

If you have an old pump, maybe it would be a good time to start saving for 
a new one - maybe it's trying to tell you something.


&gt;I thought it would help quiet down a noisey fuel pump and if so, that
&gt;would point to the source of a whine. Most likely I have a healthy
&gt;engine.
