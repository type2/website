Subject: Re: Door &amp; Window rubber experiences?

the grey seals that go around the doors are not properly reproduced.   the
repros are made of one find of rubber.  (i forget - wcm or ww, or both).  the
originals are grey rubber on the outside, with a black foam core.   they are
not squishy enough.   i say. go with good used original stuff.  

the 66 standard Rain (my exboyfriend) drives has the ww popout scrapers.  new
one and a half years ago.   they are now possible to open, but were d*nm near
impossible for a while.  (we took the windows off the 65 deluxe that got
shelved).   the contour is wrong.    i am sticking to good used or nos in the
future.

picky picky vintage pervert, eh? well,  my cars may not be shiny, but they
have the correct parts.

btw, i finally used a computer with a big colour screen, and saw the pictures
of yr 64 deluxe.   very nice.  ( i want one.)   show us the interior, now,
please   : )
