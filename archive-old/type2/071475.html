Hiya Roger,

Definitely go with the Bentley.  This is money well spent.

And a hint for you..........try scouting out your local book resellers before 
you make your purchase.  An older copy of Bentley will feature wiring 
diagrams in color.  The newer issues (more expensive too!) have gone to black 
and white with coding in an attempt to save the old profit margin.

Actually, were I you I'd spend some time looking over the older books.  You 
see, most everything that is out there for sale right now is a distillation 
of original VW materials published around thirty years ago.  In fact VW has a 
terrific in-house manual covering early baywindows 68-70.  I've found that 
the originals from that era to be much more complete.  More info and more 
pictures.  Clymer is a very good source of info from that time (a lot of the 
Bentley material looks as if it comes directly from Clymer).  The only no-no 
in collecting older manuals is Chilton's which seems to be almost a complete 
waste of time.

Haynes does original work and that is a plus.  You need to understand the 
Queen's English inasmuch as Haynes is a product of Great Britain.  They do 
tend to differ from other manuals in some procedures and are not as complete 
or detailed as Bentley.  

As has been suggested, use more than one manual for any job you have not 
tackled before.  Personally I refer to VW, Bentley/Clymer, and Muir in that 
order.  Then I ask any questions I might have here at the List.  And then, 
after a re-read and some consideration, I go for the procedure.  

Gotta tell you, the single best source is this List!
