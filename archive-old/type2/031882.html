&gt; The heater fan (electric) is only there to keep air volume up AT IDLE. Look
&gt; closely at the system! Most of the heater air comes FROM THE COOLING FAN.

You are right, sir! I had forgotten this detail. I now remember hassles 
in getting those little square pieces of tin to fit properly over the 
attachment points in question. I was missing one when I got my bus, but 
found a junk yard replacement many years ago that is still with me. You 
are certainly right about engine fan driving cooling air into heater 
system. 

Just to be sure, we are talking about a pancake engine, right? Mine is a 
'78.

&gt; There are supposed to be one-way flapper valves on the fan shroud assembly
&gt; (most are missing; having been removed by &quot;mechanics&quot;). These valves are
&gt; right at the heater box/shroud junction. The way they work is that the
&gt; vehicle always gets AT LEAST the volume from the electric fan. If the
&gt; engine's fan exceeds this amount, the valves close and you get air from
&gt; there instead.

You are talking about little valves at the heater box/ shroud junction.  Not
the big flapper valves at the fan housing/ cylinder tin junction. Yes?  As I
understand it, the big flaps are actuated by the thermostat. Closed when
engine is cold, to block air to the cylinders and help warm up engine
quickly, then open when engine is warm, to give full cooling air to
cylinders. Designed to default to open position when thermostat poops out
(which they do- often). Thermostats and even the flaps themselves are often
removed by &quot;mechanics&quot;, especially in warm southern CA where I live. 
Removing anything seems like a bad idea to me. 

But little flaps on the passage from engine fan housing to heater boxes?  
A separate set of flaps that is not the big ones I discuss above? I've 
never seen these. If that is what you mean, then mine are indeed missing. 

&gt; Do this: turn your heat on (electric fan off), and rev the engine up. See
&gt; what happens.

OK. I'll check it out and report back. I should find more heater air when
revving and little air when at idle, right? To assess contribution of air ram
effect (if any), it seems like the following test should be illustrative: 

Check heater output with vehicle at rest and engine at idle. Should be low,
with only electric heater fan and low revving engine fan providing air. Rev
engine of vehicle at rest. Heater output should increase, reflecting more air
driven by engine air fan. Drive at freeway speed with rpms high. Assess
heater airflow. It should be at least as high as was noted with vehicle at
rest (unless there is some other effect of freeway airflow on my heater box
leaks that I have not considered). Take foot off gas (ideally while on a
downhill stretch to maintain vehicle speed). Let engine rpms drop to idle
speed.  Assess heater airflow. If air ram effect is insignificant, then
heater output should be constant with foot on or off the gas, and the same as
noted with vehicle at rest. If air ram effect is significant. heater output
should drop some (because engine fan is moving less air) but remain higher
than noted when vehicle is at rest (due to air ram contribution). 

&gt; how about this... (sardonic taunt snipped)

Lighten up a little please. Let's keep things civil.

&gt; It really doesn't matter too much what the engine compartment's absolute
&gt; pressure is, what matters is how it COMPARES to the air pressure immediately
&gt; below the engine (HOT air).

Yes. And it surely is complex. Air pressure drops when air velocity
increases. Since air all around the bus is rushing past at something close to
freeway speed, I would expect that pressure outside the tin would be lower at
freeway speed than at rest. Maybe lower than air in the engine compartment,
which is probably swirling around and generally flowing from air intakes to
the fan intakes, but swirling around and travelling at some speed probably
less than freeway speed?  With plenty of complex turbulence going on inside
and all around the outside of the engine compartment, all kinds of unexpected
effects might be occurring. Who knows what the instantaneous air velocity is
on each side of every potential leakpoint in the tin? It could be measured,
but I'm skeptical that we can confidently determine what it is a priori.  I'd
imagine some leaks are worse than others. 

I remain unconvinced that air coming out of the engine driven by the fan 
has sufficient volume and pressure to substantially increase air 
pressure directly under the engine of a vehicle travelling at freeway 
speed.  You can feel the airstream coming out under the cylinders when 
revving engine high at rest and it's pretty small compared to the rush of 
air you feel when sticking your hand out the window at freeway speed. 
Avoiding any instance where you are sucking hot air into your cooling 
airstream seems like an obviously good idea. 

 &gt; I still say that if it was (sic) so simple, VW would have done it in a
second. 

I agree. And therein lies the basic wisdom of keeping the engine stock or 
reasonably close to it, unless you're willing to invest in a lot of R &amp; D 
to develop a demonstrably better way. I think we agree on that?

I'd still like to see some real manometer data measured at various points 
in and around the outside of the engine compartment of a vehicle 
travelling at various speeds. Since we are also arguing about how 
significant heating from various engine and transmission sources is to 
the airstream, temperature measurements would be useful as well. 

In the meantime, I'll keep my tin and seals up.
