&gt; &gt; So what I am gathering here is that the Schadek is thought to be a nice
&gt; &gt; pump, Bob is getting great pressure from his Melling, the Schadek is $30
&gt; &gt; and aluminum and requires some mods to install along with a type 1 cover
&gt; &gt; plate and longer studs, the Melling is $70 and bolts right up but is cast
&gt; &gt; iron and theoretically could expand at a different rate than the case...
&gt; 
&gt; The melling will not bolt right up any easier than the schadek. Being both
&gt; type 1 30mm pumps, they are dimensionally similar and will require similar
&gt; mods to work. The mods required depend on the cam and gear combo.

no this was a type IV melling and bolted right in, also had new cam
too. not sure if it is bolted or riveted would have to look at the photos
I took during assembly
