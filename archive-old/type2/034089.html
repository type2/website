Subject: Frozen van needs a new home.

Hello everyone,

My van is still sitting frozen in my driveway right now, I really hate 
Wisconsin Winters!  I charged up the battery and it still would not start.  
I dumped some heat in the tank and tried a while later and it still would 
not start.  I Think when I do get it started and put away, it will be put a 
way for a while.  Any tips on how I should store it?  It may end up sitting 
for a few years until I can get back to working on it.  There is a thought 
in the back of my mind to sell it to someone who will not let it sit.  It's 
an 81' vanagon, modified with carbs.  It has ran very well until the cold 
snap of winter just hit us last week.  It is a project van that I am working 
on.  Mechanicaly it is sound, but I have put a lot of work to get it back on 
its way.  If you are interested let me know and I will get you more info for 
you.  thanks.
Dan
