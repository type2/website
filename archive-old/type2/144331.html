Subject: Electrolux 

Help Please,,,,  I am trying to get my Electrolux Fridge &amp; stove working in my Westi SO-69 before my upcoming pottery show.  I have electricity to my interior plug-in, however, if I plug in the strange male two prong fridge plug into the strange female plug it blows the fuse (ya know, the one that's just like a house fuse).   The wire from the fuse to the strange female plug looks new, could this be wired wrong?  
 
Anyone have information about this fridge?  
Electrolux RA 10A
Product # 9261504
Serial #845
12 Volt
85 Watt
 
I just got this van &amp; am so a newbie at electric stuff.  My interior is just like the pic of the 69 Westi on the type2_dot_com website.  http://www.type2_dot_com/library/camper/westpics.htm
I'm trying to find out as much info as possible on this SO-69 conversion since I am going to restore this Westi.  Any info would so be appreciated and so NEEDED!
 
Also in need of info for my propane(?) stove.   I have the propane bottle but am not getting any fuel to my burners.  
 
Thanks Everyone!
