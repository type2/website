First thing that you should check is whether the fuel injection system 
is intact, or whether some previous owner switched over to carbs. If 
the former, there's a good (but not perfect) chance that most 
everything is stock. If the latter, don't expect anything to be stock 
until confirmed.

Check to see whether all of the tin is in place and intact, with a seal 
around the perimeter. Even if the seal needs to be replaced, having all 
the tin and a seal is a good sign; their absence is a bad sign.

Richard is right: don't even try to start it before replacing the fuel 
lines, whatever they may be.

New gas, of course, and new oil.

Good luck!
