&gt; Randall,

&gt; You seem like a nice reasonable guy so, I'll help you out a little.
&gt;
&gt; First remove your gas lines and throttle from your carbs
&gt; Next unbolt the carb and remove the intake manifolds
&gt; Now finally place the carb on a hard flat surface and strike as hard 
&gt; as you
&gt; can with a 16 lbs. sledge

My wife has suggested the same thing, only involving the whole bus and 
with me inside it.

&gt; Seriously, spend the ridiculous price on a new set of 34ict's and go 
&gt; home
&gt; happy.

At over $400 I might be happy, but I couldn't go home.

&gt; An engine is a careful balance of harmonic integration, with your 
&gt; spitting
&gt; on it having no relevant contribution, (personal experience)
&gt; before you go down this road there are some other big things you 
&gt; should look
&gt; at. (compression, oil pressure, engine noises, that is if it runs at 
&gt; all)
&gt; If all are ok then by the carbs set them up, then we can talk about 
&gt; timing.

Agreed.  Right now I'm just trying to get the thing to move under it's 
own power.  If I can get it so that it runs reasonably and I can take a 
few short trips, it will help the lobbying at home.  I have seen the 
kind of time and money people drop into project cars.  If I can get 
this carb to run in an acceptable fashion, then I'm looking at 
replacing the rotten tires ($250-300), then rusty brakes ( $who knows). 
  I've got quite a list after that.  So after I do the graduation party 
for my youngest tomorrow, I'll get back to the carb, try tuning it up, 
and I'll let you all know how it went.

If I go missing just look at the scrap metal places for an orange cube. 
  I'll be the gooey center.
