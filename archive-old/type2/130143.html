I think that you'll find that the $5 temp plate will be good all the way
home. People do this kind of thing all the time and DMV has a means to
accommodate the process. I think you'll be okay as long as the title is
good on the seller's end and you show that you have proof of insurance.
I think proof of insurance can just be your last insurance statement
that shows your policy number or the little insurance card that shows
your insurance is current. Just don't show up with an insurance card
that expired 2 years ago.
