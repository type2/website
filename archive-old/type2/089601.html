Subject: Clips &amp; Chrome

Hiya All,

I had my 70 Bus painted.  Before the paint job I removed the beltline chrome 
in order to have it stripped, polished and reannodized.  In the meantime I'm 
wondering what to do with the clips that hold the beltline chrome in place.  
Specifically, some of the clips look to be in pretty good shape rust-wise 
others don't look so hot.  I don't wanna put the rusty clips back in place 
(even though they'd work, I'm sure) under the bright shiny chrome and on top 
of new paint.

Has anybody out there dealt with this situation before?  How did you prep the 
clips for replacement?  Sand and paint?  POR-15?  Other options?

Mike
