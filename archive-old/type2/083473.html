&gt;    Hi All
&gt;
&gt;  I'm in search of the one way check valve that goes in the vacuum line from the engine to the brake booster. Anyone with an old bus they are stripping have one? Or anyone know a source for these?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks

Last one I got came from the dealer.  Come to think of it, it's the last
part that I bought from the dealer
