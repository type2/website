I wanted to remind everyone to keep in mind the things that slip away easily as time 
passes.  I am a professional mechanic.  I like to think I keep an eye on things.

This morning while checking out oil leaks on my '69 Type II I had a very diluted drop 
of oil land on my forehead.  Above me the soft line running from the fuel tank to the 
side hard line had begun leaking.  As it leaked down the trans case it collected some 
grunge and was falling to the ground, giving the appearance of a harmless oil leak.

On the port side the factory clamp had rotted off and the hose was being held in place 
by stretch alone.  The hose was so old that it fell apart as I pulled it off to 
replace it.  I have no doubt this was the original 27 year old hose.

I have been driving this vehicle 60 miles a day for the last six months and wouldn't 
have looked for this had it not found me.

VWs seem to be notorious for engine fires.  I really believe that 99% of these fires 
can be prevented.  If you haven't replaced--or had someone replace--all your fuel 
lines and installed clamps at every joint since you've owned your vehicle, spend the 
time and few dollars and do this.

And while I'm on the subject, carry a quality fire extinguisher with you always.  Many 
people still do not.  Foolish.  Most engine fires can be put out quickly...but not 
with a shirt being fanned on it because a shirt was the only thing available.

Also, another good reason is the relative cost of the vehicles we drive.  Most are 
modified to the point of being worth several times to us over what the insurance will 
pay before totalling a vehicle out.  If you have several thousand dollars into a 
vehicle the insurance company will pay $1000, you will lose.  Don't!  Prevent anything 
you can.

Todd
