In Dallas yesterday I dropped by the big NAPA warehouse to eyeball their
distributor for the '72 bus.  This distributor is a rebuilt Bosch
vacuum-advance model distributor.  The VW number stamped on the body was
211-905-205-Q and the NAPA part number was #48-916.

Can anyone tell if this VW number is the correct one for the '72?  

Also, my single Webber progressive setup has a vacuum port on the manifold.
 Would this be the correct place to tap the vacuum if I bought and used
this distributor.
