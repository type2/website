What is interesting is that the Americans were given first dibs at running the plant but they thought that the &quot;Beetle&quot; 
would never amount to anything and instead passed the buck to the British. Major Hirst had enough foresight to 
see a diamond in the rough and took on rebuilding the plant.

As appreciation to him, the factory workers built Maj. Hirst aBeetle with so much detail that it reputedly cost as 
much as the real thing to build. Kinda makes those Franklin Mint &quot;toys&quot; look shabby by comparison.

&gt; When he arrived, the factory was heavily damaged by air attack.  It was
&gt; really Ivan Hirst's incredible efforts that turned the factory and the
&gt; company around and got production of the beetle going full swing.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I give more credit to Ivan than Hitler.  Just my view...
