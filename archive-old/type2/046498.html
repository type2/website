&gt; Not acceptable inside a bus or any other vehicle [I assume you're referring

&gt; deplete the oxygen.

Actually, it's the other way around.  They normally produce nothing but
carbon dioxide and water, but as they deplete the oxygen the combustion
efficienty drops and you start to get carbon monoxide instead of carbon
dioxide.  This makes you dead.

I've a friend who was a cop in Nevada.  He got the bright idea to use a
catalytic heater in his car while on a stake-out.  Luckily, cops have to
check in by radio every hour or he would have died.
