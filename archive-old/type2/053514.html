Gentlepersons-
                       The recent thread of rear end saggings has lead me to 
enquire, what is
the usual height (ground to a measureable point), of both front and rear 
suspensions?
I'm pretty sure the rear is OK, but the front appears to have a slight 
&quot;California Rake&quot;.
If so, other than complete replacement of the front leaves, is there an 
adjustment ala
the rear? Enquiring minds want to know...
TIA.
Tony in NJ
