The right carb is 1 + 2.....those cylinders work..... the left carb is 3/4.
Maybe a dumb question but....Are #3 and #4 wires on the correct plugs?

&gt; &gt;OK, I give. Cylinders 1 &amp; 2 seem to be firing right along, but I can take

engine
&gt; &gt;at idle or high rpm (there are sparks), so I'm guessing there's nothing
&gt; &gt;happening there...
&gt;
&gt; How is the power?  Does it feel like it's running on two cylinders or four
&gt; under power?
&gt;
&gt; My guess is that the idle circuit on the right carb is messed up somehow.
&gt; Since it is only on one side of the engine that pretty much rules out
&gt; anything electrical, except possibly the distributor cap.
&gt;
&gt; One test you could do is to manually pour a small amount of gas into the
&gt; right carb while the engine is idling.  Use a small baster and just put in
&gt; a slow stream of drops or you will flood it.  If the idle speeds up, that
&gt; indicates that your right carb is not supplying fuel mixture to the
&gt; cylinders at idle.  Check for a clogged idle jet/orifice.
