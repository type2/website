Subject: Dons Syncro!

Out side of the nearly completed &lt;comparitively&gt; '67 Westy Resto, Don's
Syncro has to be one of the proudest looking VWs that I have seen!!! Man, it
was real real pretty. If the odometer showed half of what it did I would
have believed it. I was happy to have had the oppty to help and meet Don.
For a 'Strailian bloke he seemed alright! ;-) KIDDDING! He was quite the
gentleman and was extremely excited about the days events. As it was with
Dve and Joel, Mattyj and his foxy Kiwi friend, Don didn't have time for a
meal. He arrived about the time I had freshly painted Z-bed mechanicals
strung &quot;about&quot; the backyard. It looked like industrial wash day. We chatted
for just a few minutes and he was gone. I watched that new Syncro purchase
until it was totally out of sight. I could see Don with that old &quot;No worries
~ No Drama&quot; smile on his face heading out on I-10. VERY pretty bus. Nice
meeting you Don and &quot;Good on ya, Mate!&quot;

Sorry to hear the A/C was DOA. That was a surprise to me. =(
