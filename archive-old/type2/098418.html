Subject: Re: [VB] Recovering....&amp; Just Putting Along

I'm snug as a bug (or bus or vanagon) in my 84 Westy while it's raining
like mad outside here in Ventura, CA
---------------------------
Hopefully you're not living in a Westy during your recovery.
I'm a total stranger  but I'd definatey put some money in a pay pal
account that somebody could get to you.
