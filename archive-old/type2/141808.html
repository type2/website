Subject: Engine Choice

OK listers,
Need your opinion.  My sons 68 Type II requires a new engine.  Here are my
choices.  Let me know what you think.

1.  Buy a used 1600 which is said to have been rebuilt ($1,200 installed)
2.  Buy from source like GEX or other new long block w/ 36 month guarantee
($1,200 just for the engine)

Also what size engine would you folks put in this old bird.  


Appreciate your opinions.

PS:  I have always been one to get what I pay for and thus are leaning
towards getting the mail order turn key for the extra bucks.  But what
displacement would work best?
