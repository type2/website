Hi volks,
 

&gt; VW-Code Farbcode Deutscher Name Englischer Name 
&gt; P4P4..      L63H       Taigagrün            Sage Green 

 I know this as Taiga Green, which I presume is the English translation
of the German. My '77 is two tone, with &quot;Dove White&quot; over Taiga Green.

 I'm pretty sure that my Haynes &quot;restoration handbook&quot; lists this colour
as Taiga green, too. It's a good colour for a camper because it's bright
enough to be visible on a dark road and yet blends in reasonably well
at a campsite. Not too easy on the eye, though :-).

Cheers,
	W.
