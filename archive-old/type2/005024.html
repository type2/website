The further you advance your timing (the more BTDC) the hotter it will run.
I'd make sure your total advance when you rev the engine up is no more than
28d BTDC (for an upright).  Also, I think I remember you saying that oil
temp light comes on at 220F?  If so, I think that's still pretty cool.  And
you don't know if the oil temp was going to stabilize, if it was going to
stabilize (equilibrium) around 240F then I wouldn't worry about it
especially if the engine is new (they say new engines run hotter).  I'm
still dealing with a new pancake engine I installed in February.  My oil
temp gauge stops rising at 255/260F, that's a little hot right, but it goes
to 280F if you gotta push it (shut it down, shut it down).  The bottom of my
oil filler tube melted off somehow.  Ugh..  I'm going to try thicker oil,
and make sure none of my wheels are sticking, and if I have to remove my
catalytic converter to unload the motor.

Good luck!

&gt; I have just about lost it over this problem. I just made some changes
today.
&gt; Taking advice from the many on the list who offered suggestions, I decided
&gt; to install a deep sump to give the engine an oil capacity of 5 quarts.
Also
&gt; the oil was switched from the 20W-50 it previously was running, to
straight
&gt; 40W. The timimg was adjusted to 10 degrees BTDC. After these changes a
test
&gt; run was in order, so I took it up the highway, and after about 15 minutes
at
&gt; 55 mph the oil light came on telling me we were hot again. After cursing,
I
&gt; turned around and headed back, this time at full throttle, all the while
&gt; thinking if the engine blew, I would get out, take off the license plates
&gt; and walk home never to return again. When I got it home and in the garage,
I
&gt; let it idle for a minute and there was a sputter every couple of seconds
&gt; like a faint backfire.
&gt; Here's my setup:
&gt; Brand new DP 1600 from VW Mexico. (approx. 400 miles now)
&gt; New heater boxes (Bus Depot)
&gt; New stock exhaust (Bus Depot)
&gt; New Solex H30/31 PICT carb (freshly tuned per Barb and Eric)
&gt; New intake manifold.
&gt; Oil-Bath air cleaner
&gt; New 009 mechanical advanced distributor (timed to 10 degrees BTDC)
&gt; Petronix Ignitor ignition
&gt; New Blue coil
&gt; New generator
&gt; Rebuilt stock fuel pump
&gt; '71 engine tin stripped and painted/ no thermostat, vanes wide open
&gt; New engine compartment seals
&gt; New Yokohama 356's 32 PSI in each
&gt; New plastic hoses from shroud to heater boxes (Gene Berg)
&gt; New dipstick temp. sensor (Gene Berg)
&gt; 91 octane fuel
&gt; At 350 miles I changed the oil, adjusted the vales, adjusted the idle with
&gt; tach/dwell meter to 900 RPM. Now I've added a new deep sump, changed to
40W,
&gt; and timed it to 10 degrees BTDC. Actually I've tried a variety of timing
&gt; settings. Also tuned the carb like Barb and Eric says. This bus is
starting,
&gt; idleing, and running very smoothly. I've been working on this problem way
&gt; too long, and am losing interest in it quickly. If I can't figure it out
&gt; soon, it's going to the mechanic, and if he can't figure it out, it will
&gt; become the next owner's problem. Any more ideas? What could I be
&gt; overlooking? This problem is definately not a lack of dumping money into
it.
