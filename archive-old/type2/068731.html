Subject: heater blower (con't)

I just took the fan/motor assembly out of Hildegarde.  That was easy!  
Apart from it being cold and dark, I had very little trouble.  So, now I 
am thinking I should run to K-mart before it closes and get grease, 
de-greaser, and maybe WD-40 (for general cleaning/un freezing).  I know, 
I know, I should have WD-40 lying around anyway.  Any suggestions on 
what type of grease to get?  I'll get Gunk de greaser probably.
