Subject: Engine # location? 

Where is the engine number on a 76 type II?
There is a number GD001776 on the fan casing? just to the right of the
coil. Is this the engine #, Part# for that piece, or an engine type number?
It seems silly for the engine serial number to not be on the block?
I'm not sure what type of number I'm looking for, but when chasing
parts, several people have asked what the engine number is? What are they
asking for, and where do  find it.
Thanks
