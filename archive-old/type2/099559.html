&gt;Just finally got my engine back in my bus and the
&gt;starter will not work.  It is not even clicking like a
&gt;dead starter would, it just does absolutely nothing
&gt;when you turn the key.

Make sure the rear end of the bus is up on jackstands
before doing the following test, I don't want you running
yourself over:

With all wires connected, jump (with a remote starter switch--
or a screwdriver, if you don't have one) the post with the battery
cable to the push on connector terminals.  Does the starter run?
If so, there is a problem in the wiring/ignition switch/etc.
If not, then either the starter is not grounded, or is faulty.
Pull it, and examine per the Bentley Manual.  It may be
that your solenoid has gone south.  I highly recommend
installing the Bosch starter relay kit--details can be found
in the Type2 Library, the relay can be obtained from the (now)
famous Bus Depot.

&gt;Is there a special order to putting on the 3 wires on the terminal bolt.

No, just clean them up with sandpaper, or a whizzy-brush.

&gt;To me, it seems as though that the ground is missing or something.
&gt;I haven't found anything that would indicate a ground
&gt;for the starter though.

It is a strap that connects the front of the transmission to the frame.
