&gt; Hey Jim,
&gt;          My name is Glenn and I am a VW-A-HOLIC. Recently bought a house in 
&gt; Spartanburg, SC, mainly to have a garage for my Volksie.  It's a sunroof 69, 

hehehe.. my friends were making fun of me because I recently decided not 
to move to the colder mid-west because I didn't want to have my bus be 
in an environment where they used salt and it would damage my body.

My boss made a joke as if I were married:

imaginary wife: &quot;Mike, why don't we move to ......&quot;
me: &quot;I'm sorry honey, I just don't think that would be ok for the bus.&quot;

hahahahaha
