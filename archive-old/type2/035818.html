Subject: Re: FI: now won't start.

John made a point of noting that even 20 or 30 seconds of running would
skew the reading significantly. I had, in fact, run the engine for about 30
seconds earlier, so I might have been getting a reading effected by that
brief run.

The symptom has changed now, though, as she won't even start.

I'm going to Autozone this morning to buy a fuel pressure tester. I've put
this off long enough. I really can't test the fuel delivery without one of
these and I've had to make assumptions up til now.

I'll keep you posted. Incidentally, I went a head and bought a new sensor,
since I'll need it eventually anyway. I tested it out of the bus, and with
my finger on the sensor side, I could see the resistance changing rapidly.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;Joe, Karl, and John,
&gt;I checked John's data of 8/3/99 in the archive and determined that the 
&gt;values Joe stated for the resistance of his temp sensors was associated with 
&gt;temperatures of between 100 and 125 degrees F. Joe said it was a cold engine 
&gt;when he measured the resistances, which to my way of thinking could be 
&gt;&quot;unwarm to the touch&quot;, not necessarily ambient.
&gt;So I would be concerned to know before investing in new sensors, Joe, what 
&gt;was the actual temperature of the head at the time of your measurement?
&gt;And John, would an error in temperature ascertainment this slight be a cause 
&gt;for backfiring?
&gt;Just trying to save Joe a few bucks and more frustration...
