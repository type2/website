Subject: Re: [T2] Starting probs *hangs head in shame*

Most of it is uphill and will be a little tight navigating to the backyard. 
But I still want to get this engine running enough to see if it's knocking 
or anything to see if a canidate for top end rebuild. And then eventually I 
want to turn it into a driver.

And I just wanna say I got it running and drove it where it gonna sit for a 
long time. :)

But yes, that is last resort.


&gt;
&gt;for that short a distance a come along or block and tackle might be
&gt;sufficient, one direction should be downhill I would guess
