Subject: Suggestion for removing broken cylinder stud

Hi All:

So I had removed all but one of the cylinder studs on my type IV case.
The last one was difficult so I soaked it in Break Free CLP for a couple
of days. Then I placed the stud in a vise (lengthwise) and twisted the
case half to break the stud free. Well the stud broke, but not the way I
expected. It twisted off right above the threads.

Any suggestion on a removal procedure I can do at home? Or is it off to
the machine shop for some heat treatment and careful drilling/tapping. I
thought I might use some liquid nitrogen to cool down the case to make
the threads looser. Think this will work?

Regards,
