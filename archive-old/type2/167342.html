Subject: Re: wtb: Westfalia mattress foam

&gt;&gt; If someone could provide me with used foam,, foam with the fabric,  and the
&gt;&gt; boards..  I'd go that way... or new! :)
&gt; 
&gt; If you're planning a trip out west to Alberta, I have the foam and boards out 
&gt; of a 72-73. You'd be welcome to have them...

Thanks for the offer Peter. 

I am pretty sure the pre 74 seat foam is much thicker,, probably 4&quot;... and 
the material on a 73 is yellow fabric.. and the 72 is yellow vinyl... 

I am getting fussy.. I have good 74 blue plaid material... I need the 
foam,,and the dimensions as my foam is sooo cruddy I can only guess it is 
about 2.5 inches and the other is 3&quot; thick
