Subject: Re: [T2] How difficult is welding ?

Does the floor rise and fall as it passes over the supports in the floor? Is
that normal or did they use too much heat? Am looking at the primered shot.
LOTS of hard work in that bus...

the metal is not quite as thick as what vw used and because of so many
welds, I think the heat made it go that way. It did the same thing in this
persons floor replacement as well:

so I didn't feel as bad when it happened to mine. Maybe I could have used
fewer welds. With the camping interior all in you can't even tell the floor
was replaced.
