Subject: [T2] Wheel Bearing on my 221,000 mi Westy finally going?

The joke with my 221k mi virtually all original Westy is that since 150K
mi I've been letting things go assuming I gotta rebuild it soon anyway-
like those CV seals ripped for last 25K (hell, I'll wait until they
start clicking, but still OK!) or that manifold to head leak where I
finally did replace the copper seal in Nov. after noticing some
compression drop in #1 -still 130- 150lbs compression). Or not bothering
with wheel bearing regrease since 150K.   But it won't quit (2nd gear is
tough)- the only bus whose engine will outlast the trans???  A couple of
weeks ago I noticed a vibration that is similar to driving on studded
tires- got less at 60 mph, was most noticable around 40 mph.  I did
replace a front wheel thinking it was the worn steel tread endies
sticking out through one side of the rubber- and the front wheels felt
tight when I spun and rocked the jacked up wheels.  The vibration was
still there on a 400mi trip last weekend, and when I rocked the wheels
with them NOT jacked up, the driver side made a &quot;clunk&quot; that felt like a
loose bearing.  I'm awaiting the bearing kits from BUS DEPOT (German
bearings), but must ask- do I need a press to get out the inner bearing
as Bentley implies?  Or can they be tapped out and tapped in?
   Regarding the milage, I do use TUFOIL in the oil, and checking the
rocker valve tappets (hydraulic lifters), there is virtually no wear.  
Alternator, fuel pump, distributor, is all original;  starter, lifters
were replaced once as have been the pushrod tube seals and the engine
was out once at 150K  to switch to a new clutck disk.    MB
