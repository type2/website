Subject: Re: [T2] Air cooled junkyard

[...]

The ACVWJY site is down, and the owner is not answering e-mail.

The junkyard itself was forced by local &quot;authorities&quot; to close down, and not
long after the website went away also.

I've been trying for several months to contact someone with information,
etc., but no luck yet.
