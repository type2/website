&gt; heres my bus comment:
&gt;im picking up a 66 deluxe on saturday 
&gt;and i wanted to know if anyone had any ideas as to where i can get new
&gt;glass from....
&gt;the front drivers side windsheild is broken
&gt;id like to buy new glass if i could...
&gt;but id like to have a window thats as old as the other one
&gt;anyone have any ideas?

Rocky Mountain Motorworks sells the windshields for a Splitty as 
a pair for $160.00. Bus Boys or Bus Depot may have them cheaper. 
I don't think John at aircooled_dot_net has glass at all, but check anyway.
