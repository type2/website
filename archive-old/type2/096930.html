Subject: Bus for sale -- Sacramento/Davis, CA

Hi folks:

The previous owner of my 78 Westy is also selling his former daily 
driver -- a 77 Bay Bus with three rows of seats, gas heater and some 
other amenities.   The body is California rust free, engine is 
carbureted  passed smog last year.   Not running now due to fuel 
system problem I've not taken time to look at.   They are looking for 
about $800 and will show all the maintenance records, etc.   If I 
didn't rent an apartment, I'd already own it!

Drop me a line if interested and I'll put you in touch with the 
owner.   Whole bus sale only as is, no repairs to sell and no parting.

Thanks,

BEN

78 Westy
