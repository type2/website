Powermac:
This is an occasional problem in the rust belt. I'd try to find a cleanable fuel
filter and install it ahead of the factory filter, like a pre- filter. I just
did this on my 80 westy (not driven for 6 years). I just drove it tonite. I'll
have to check the pre- filter to see what I caught!

&gt; I have a 1979 Westy with a rusty gas tank. I can go about 100 miles before I
&gt; have to replace the fuel filter. I cut the filter in half and was shocked to
&gt; see all of the rust in there...
&gt; Will the rust eventually flush it self out?
&gt; Is pulling the gas tank the only way to clean it?
&gt; Can I get it out without dropping the engine?
&gt; And does anyone know where I can get a new tank? (If I have to remove the
&gt; tank I'd rather put a new one back.)
