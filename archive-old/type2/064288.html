Subject: Mysterious Starting Woes

heya Folks,

got the '77s valves set and brakes bled this weekend. Much thanks to Mr. VW
himself Richard Palmer for his time and patience.

okay, it musta been poor richard's magic touch becuae the engine cranked when
turned the key after a couple of times. something stefan and i couldn't get it
to do. i started it a couple times today so maybe it ain't the starter. the
last couple of times i tried to crank it nothing happened except a click under
the dash. i got on the floor and found the clicking coming from a metal box
that is mounted just under the dash. 4 or 5 wires coming outta said box.

i noticed one of the terminals was corroded and figured this might be the
problem. i didn't have time to clean it up but will tommorrow. couple of
questions: what is this metal box? i've never seen anything like it. i'm also
going to clean up the starters terminals and also the batteries. if this box
is where the problem is, how much to replace?
