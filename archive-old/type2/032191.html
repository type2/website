Subject: Pop-top lengths?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.990409172240.5876A-100000_at_sparky&gt;

Hello listees,

      This is a question out of curiousity.  How do the lengths of the
pop-tops differ for the front pivot and rear pivot pop-tops repectively. 
That is, are they both the same lenth or is one longer than the other.

               it just that place ya know.)
