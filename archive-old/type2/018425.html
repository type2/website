hey....if anyone needs a mechanic or restoration guy (Steve maybe...if
and when you come this way) there is an INCREDIBLE guy who has worked on
V-dubs for 20+years... He has 15-20 v-dubs in his yard...including a
show-class crew cab .....ooooooohhh droooool.... that has been in VW
trends,, he, his son, and his wife know what they are doing...no
joke...  best mechanic I've ever seen!  REally reasonable prices too!
They took me to their house... there is a barn next to it filled with
vintage VW stuff...he also does work and has parts for new vw's  any
make!  He is definitely worth a trip to see...

If you need directions or anything.....steve maybe.. give me a call
(920-748-6209) or email me...
