Subject: Re: Bubble Camper Int. in a Splittie?

We have in knoxville a '64-65 westy with the full-length '68-73
poptop attached to it.  I'm not sure that this is original, but
it seems to work well with the original Westy interior. an 
improvement over the little pop-top, that's fer shure.

Sorry, no info about bubble camper into splitty, just thought
this was interesting....
