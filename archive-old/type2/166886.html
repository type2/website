Subject: Hey! Mark! Take 2

Hiya Again Mark,

When I drilled through the wheel in the bus I was surprised at how much material I had to go through.? The thought of simply tapping that hole (rather than drilling through) did occur to me, but the hub material (aluminum? magnesium??some kinda alloy?) looked to soft too hold the puller bolts.

But you're telling me that they will hold, right?

6mm bolts, right?? Number 5 hardness?? I did manage to snap a puller bolt on my first try (it was a 2 I think) and that's what convinced me that I had needed to go all the way through.? 

And another question.........It seems to me that any wheel I put on my steering column is on there with a vengeance (ala the snapped puller bolt).? Anything I can do to take some of the grab out of those splines on the column?? Anti-seize?? Oil?? Whale blubber?? Or do I even want to mess with that?

Mike
