&gt; 2.  Water coming through rear heater vent.  &quot;Hey, is it supposed to be
&gt; cold in here?&quot; :-)

Under the rear bench or under the fridge (if you have one)?

Sorry, didn't know other busses had more than one vent.  This one's 
under the bench.  I'm just assuming it's a heater vent, since it's the 
only one.
