Hey Y'all,
  I have been guilty of this in the past also, so I am talking to
myself also here, this is a world wide web. The U.S. did not offer the
Bus with the upright after 71, but other countries did. Before
correcting someone ,think globaly, they may be different in a different
part of the world.

As for the Tank removal, if you have an upright, you have to pull the
motor, type 4 you have the option. On a type 4 motor you need to decide
how long it will take to remove the carbs or FI depending on year vs.
the time to drop the motor. I prefer to drop the motor, but its up to
you. I have both types and have done it both ways.
