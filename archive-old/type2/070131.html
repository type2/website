Hi,

Where I manage to get all of the kinks out of the 'new' '71 westy enough to
get to Yosemite from Berkeley, CA and back with no problem.

Put in a stock size, but good engine that been lying around for two years in
the bus.  It has; Berg semi-hemi cut DP heads with no spacer (about 7.0:1
CR), shimmed stock springs, solid rocker shaft with stock tips, steel
pushrods, some cheesy welded CW crank, LW flywheel, stock cam, lifters with
a slot filed, working '71 fan housing, oil cooler and thermostat, deep sump
with low pressure oil cooler mounted under car with a high pressure fuel
pump switched at the dash, 96 plate high pressure external cooler &amp; filter,
new stock '71 CA smog carb (34-PICT2) and air cleaner, '71 distributor with
new tune-up kit, 4500 rpm rev-limiting rotor, stock heat platinum plugs, big
'ol headers &amp; dual mufflers, O2 sensor and gauge package. Wow.

I had to beat a few manifold leaks to get this to run right, even with all
the new stock stuff.  Finally passed smog after setting the oil level in the
air cleaner down to the line, as well as setting the accelerator pump to
it's minimum.  Limits for HC's in CA are now 400 ppm, 4% CO, run both at
idle and 2000-2500 rpm.  Twice the limit and you're tagged &quot;gross polluter&quot;
and have to see the ref.  I passed in the 120's HC, and barely at 3.96% CO.    

The dual muffin dist. has quite a range, set at 5 ATDC &quot;at idle&quot; it still
advances to the high thirties BTDC, and seems to pull a little better under
~2200 rpm.

I added the external cooler after trying just the stock cooler, un uh, not
here, temps hit 210 quickly and at night up hills.

I needed to lube and free up the emergency brake cables where they had
rusted into the housings at the rear, that got the rear wheels free.  New
front disc pads and opening up the calipers freed up the front wheel drag.


After some last minute phone calls trying to change the insurance to this
bus's VIN and pick up the spare tire that had been loaned someone, I left
for Hetch-Hetchy reservoir at 8 am having failed on both counts.  Oh well.
Finally on the road I could appreciate the latest effort as this bus was
rolling, steering and braking well.  It also seems to be a snug and strong
engine.  The big external cooler really works, temps are 190 with this 1/2
loaded westy across the 90f flats and when climbing through the hills hangs
around 210.  If I turn on the pumped cooler at around 200 it just stays at
200, even on the hardest climb on this trip.  If we stop climbing, temps
drop back to 190 or less and I turn it off.  Having this much headroom for
oil cooling is a comfortable cushion I like.  Those heads really work, lots
of power and not too hot.  I try to keep the climbs at 3800 with short peaks
of 4200 for this break-in.  

At a fill-up near Oakdale gas mileage is good, at least 23 mpg, likely
wind-aided.  It'll get premium till it can be weaned down to regular.  Oil
is apparently NOT dripping from the engine or any of the cooler lines, a
fabulous victory in engine building.  I attribute some of this to not
overfilling the engine at some point in the start-up which I have usually done.

Climbing into Yosemite Park consisted mostly of following tour buses so we
didn't have to push too hard, nice for a break-in.  At Big Oak Flat I
finalize a trail route, get my wilderness permit and call in to SO Hali, who
is too busy to take this trip.  

I really appreciate the bear canister that I took because the first night
was a rocky site with no good hanging trees.  An experienced marauding bear
stalked around my site while I was cooking my little dinner.  Not having to
worry about it snatching the food during the night was worth carrying the
extra 2.9 lbs.  They should be required in the park where there are no
boxes.  I did decide to take a less intense route, about forty miles instead
of fifty, because I would've whipped myself with the weight I ended up with.

Hetch-Hetchy and the climb up and around to a couple of it's surrounding
lakes and back were a treat.  

The bus was still there when I got back, hot, but the drinking water in the
tank was still cool.  It started right up, and I headed for a sandwich and a
beer at a nearby deli.

The trip back went smoothly.  Headwinds made it obvious that the return
mileage would be alot less, even with all the downhill out of the mountains.
Even with the dual mufflers I can suck down the steep grades in third or
even second without anything but a burble from the tail.  The Central Valley
was about 95-100 deg f as usual, I crossed it at 60-65 mph with the pump
running and held temps at 190 with Altamount Pass running up to 210.  I
can't imagine doing this much work with a stock cooling system, it just
can't keep up with this terrain.

I had tried to unsubscribe before I left, but couldn't connect to the
mailhost.  Came back to 450 messages on a couple lists.  Yeow.  OK,
vacations over, back to work, or at least reading VW mail!

Eug,
'71
