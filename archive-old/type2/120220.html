&gt; The issue is basically: the sleeve does not seem to go far enough down 
&gt; the shaft to allow the rotor to fit.  In fact, it does not go down far 
&gt; enough to even line up with the sensor.  The kit includes a spacer 
&gt; plate which can be used to increase the height of the sensor, and 
&gt; installing it makes it line up with the sleeve.  But that still leaves 
&gt; me with a rotor problem.

with both of my petronix I have had to really push it down. have you
contacted petronix about this? I kinda wonder if the sleeve is in fact
made for some distributors that have the dwell lobe on #3 cyl a bit
different, making it not exactly symetrical. I dunno. but mine were
all a PITA
