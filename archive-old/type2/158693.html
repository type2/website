Subject: Finally got her running, some engine questions

Finally got my 79 Westy driving around the block yesterday for a test
run. Been almost 6 years since I drove her home and ended up having to
totally rebuild the engine. I was hoping some people may have
suggestions to fix a couple of problem I have.

This is a 79 Fuel Injected. I have removed the EGR and gone to to a
non-cat exhaust set up. I plugged the ERG port. The engine starts fine,
idles fine and takes off fine, but when I shift to 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or
when I stomp on the gas, it lacks power. It hesitates and seems to lack
that mid-range power it should have. When in nutral I can rev the engine
no problem and it's smooth.

I'm thinking it could be something with the valves or ignition timing?
When I did the rebuild I bought jugs that made the engine a 2.1L. The
guy suggested me using lash caps on the valves. Now I know these are
hydraulic tappets so maybe I need to let them break in? Or should I
remove the caps and adjust like it's still the 2.0? Or is there
something I should check on the timing?

I'm just glad it finally running under its own power and not gushing oil
and shifts into 3rd and 4th now!
