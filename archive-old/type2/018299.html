The stamped number at the base gives it away.  It is a Holley 5200.  Actually
a Holley manufactured Weber 32/36 DGAV.  The R7243 number can be interpreted
by any &quot;real&quot; parts house.  Called the &quot;List Number.&quot;  With a Holley &quot;Master
Catalog&quot; (mine's dated mid seventies...) one gets the jetting, the original
application, the gasket p/n's etc.

You might have to try the local speed shop to find the Master Catalog.  Or
call Holley.  They are probably on the web.
