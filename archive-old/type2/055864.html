Subject: Are We Being Ripped Off

Friends on the Net,
I ran into a very pecular item yesterday. I believe that we home
mechanics are really being decieved by some air compressor dealers. I
bought a 3 H.P. Sears Oiless Air Compressor which is really a dog, buty
when I started checking it and other compressors out I found that the
ones that are Advertized as 3 H.P. are actually 2 H.P. I looked at the
compressor motor and it is rated at 15 Amps at 120VAC. One Horse Power
in all textbooks is rated at 746 Watts. To find Watts multiply Volts
times Amps. If you would check this out you will find it works out to
2.2 H.P. and if you multiply 2.2 times the 90% efficiency that most
electric motors operate at in figures at 1.98 or rounds off to 2. H.P.
While I was at Sears complaining I noticed that this deception was
carried out on other models as well. If this effects you I would
appreciate a direct mail to me as to your compressor rating and its Amps
and Voltage requirements. I feel that this practice is being carried out
by other compressor manufactors as well. I have attached a copy of my
letter to Sears for your information.
If others have experienced this problem collectively we may get redess.
Sincerely,
Jack

Subject: 		Report on an Unsatisfactory Air Compressor
Date:		1 May, 1998

1. Several years ago I purchased from the Sears Store in Yuba City,
California  a Sears Air Compressor, Model No. 919.153231  Rated at 8.5
S.C.F.M. at 40 PSI, and  7.0 S.C.F.M. at 90 PSI. The compressor is
identified as a 3 H.P. 20 gal. Model.

2. The compressor has been a very unsatisfactory product. I have never
had it produce the data plated air flow at either rated pressures. In
the first year of use it failed twice both times for a broken compressor
rod causing a catastrophic failure that required a replacement of the
piston and cylinder assembly. In both cases the repair was effected by
the Sears Service Center in Yuba City under warrantee. Since that time
the compressor has repeatedly failed for the same reason, requiring the
same parts. In desperation I phoned the Sears on line service advisor
and he recommended replacing the flywheel at the time of the next
failure, which I did. The new flywheel had a modification, a larger
&quot;Allen set screw.&quot; This was to improve the flywheel's tendency to become
loose which has led to the above failures. I noticed this modification
and after the compressor ran for a few minutes I rechecked the flywheel
and found it loose again. I drilled and tapped a new &quot;Allen Set Screw&quot;
position using the same size tap and installed an identical set screw as
the stock item, thinking that using two set screws would help stabilize
the tendency of the flywheel to wobble and work itself loose. The
flywheel by having the piston rod off-set is bound to have an unequal
force applied resulting in the characteristic tendency to wobble,
leading to undue stress being placed on the piston rod with the
resulting failure at its connecting point to the flywheel bearing.

3. The compressor ran for about 3 hrs. and then experienced a total
cataclysmic failure breaking the compressor cylinder holding device, a
major portion of the motor housing, and the usual piston and cylinder
assembly.

4. I am a farmer and I use the compressor in my shop for air driven
tools and light sandblasting of farm equipment. So in desperation I took
the compressor motor unit to a very reputable air compressor and tool
shop, The Air Tool Store, 4755 Auborn Blvd. Sacramento, Ca. Ph.
530-334-4165. This is a shop that caters to professional mechanics and
others who use air tools and Air Compressors in their vocation. I asked
if there was any way that I could use an oil type compressor with my 3
H.P. electric motor. I was surprised when they pointed out that this was
a 2 H.P. motor and not 3 H.P. as the data plate indicates.  The motor is
rated at 15 Amp. at 115VAC which equals 1725 Watts. One Horse Power is
746 Watts. 1725 Watts divided by 746 equals 2. H.P. I was also told that
the so called oil less type of compressor is used for only very light
duty work and he showed me several Sears models that he had in for
repair with the identical type of failure that my compressor
experienced. 

5. When I purchased my compressor I was very clear that it's intended
use was for farm and shop use and would be used in my busy season almost
12 hour a day.  I checked  the Internet digest that I use, a VW group,
and was quite shocked to find the very negative experiences that my
friends have had with oil less type of compressors, unfortunately most
with Sears products. 

6. I feel that Sears is guilty of a deliberately dishonest practice in
falsely advertising a 2 H.P. compressor as a 3 H.P. compressor. Further,
as a very long time Sears customer, who had many good experiences with
Sears products in the past, I really feel that I received very poor
advice as to the compressor I purchased. I don't remember the actual
price at the time of purchase, but I'm sure a search of my account would
reveal that information. It was in the neighborhood of $360.00 I have
probably spent nearly an equal amount on repair parts for this faulty
unit. I really am disappointed that Sears has practiced marketing such
poor products.

7. Two weeks ago I submitted a question on the Sears Customer Service
Web Page, which promised a phone call within 48 hours. I have repeated
this on 30 April 1998. This promise also was not kept.  To date I have
received no answer at all to my query. I used Sears in the past because
of the excellent distribution system which enabled me to  get service no
matter where I was stationed.  This was important to a serviceman with a
family. Sears used to carry good merchandise at a fair price and
provided excellent customer support.  What happened?

8. I consider myself a fairly knowledgeable mechanic. I have a degree
from the Univ. of Nebraska,  in Aircraft Maintenance and Systems. I
spent 27 years in the service as an Electrician on Submarines and as the
Maintenance Supervisor of the SR-71 program at Beale. I am a
Certificated FAA Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic and Inspector, and an
Adjunct Professor of Aircraft Maintenance at Embry-Riddle Air
University. I retired from the service  in 1970 and have taught for 28
years at Yuba College , the Yuba City Unified School  District, and
Embry-Riddle . I am intimately familiar with tools and equipment. 
Therefore I feel that the Air Compressor that I bought from Sears is a
poorly designed product, fraudulently marketed, and I should have
redress for the this unsatisfactory product.
