Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA, and Bow Wow Auto Parts

Jamie/all,

In regards to VWOA chasing trademark infringements, I heard that
the other automotive companies have also stepped up tradmark protection 
actions.  Specifically Ch**y in respect to hubcaps with the &quot;bowtie&quot; on 
them.

FWIW

Cheers, dave

&gt; I remember the garage I apprenticed at about 1983 was given a cease and desist
&gt; [sp?] order because they had painted a few emblems on the wall facing the
&gt; passing traffic.  One was a Vw emblem , 
&gt; 
&gt; Bow Wow sent me a new Catalogue with an insert today... and it describes why the
&gt; name Bow-Wow
&gt; 
&gt; 1972, Warren Buser of Seattle Wa. retired from the U.S. Coast guard and opened
&gt; an Auto Parts store for Volkswagens ONLY.  Various store names chosen were
&gt; challenged by VWoA as indicating a VW connection so he chose his childhood
&gt; nickname of &quot;Bow-Wow&quot; and defied an objection to that name.
&gt; http://www.bowwow_dot_ca/
&gt; So from that part of the short letter, it is apparent that VW has been chasing
&gt; the Trademark infringements for quite some time!
&gt; 
&gt; BTW they were nice enough to send a R &amp; L sticker of the Dog!
