Subject: Re: [T2] A question of conversion

Bob do you mean that the non FI buses do not have the slot/hole for the 
ECU(brain) of the FI system? Or are you reffering to the lack of the return 
inlet on the gas tank? Neither have been mentioned so I can throw my 1 cent 
with yours and make 2. Besides the flywheel and the others, the fuel tank 
will not have a return line for the FI system. This can be remedied with a 
few minor fittings that will allow it to work properly. The slot/hole for 
the ECU could be cut into the body if not there, I guess. To answer the 
question is not as easy as black and white. But yes you could &quot;throw&quot; that 
'79 Type IV in there....

IT JUST DEPENDS ON YOUR WIND UP. Think breath release. You can do it.

&gt;From: Access Systems &gt; I'd also like to know if I can throw a 79 type 4 
&gt;engine into the 72 space
&gt; &gt; without modification.

&gt;yes and no.

&gt;the 72 engine is a carbed engine
&gt;the 79 engine is a fuel injected engine.
