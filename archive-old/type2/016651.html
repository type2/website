&gt; Hey, Type2 sisters and brothers,
&gt; (As rugged as anything else on the block, but with 3 liters less engine.)
Mark:
Very imaginative and I agree 100%. Still, though, if I could just get a
4-liter Lexus engine in one of my vanagons, it sure would be sweet.
Well, at least it would have plenty of power. 
While many of our Euopean listees are concerned about whether dual carbs
will bankrupt them, I would like to say that I saw fuel advertised at
$.869/ gallon on Wednesday. I think fuel is 4 to 5 times that in Europe,
so it's easy to see why there are so many Expeditions, Navigators,
Sububurbans and other tanks driven here, but VW's are primarily designed
for the European market.
While on this thread, does anyone have readily available the conversions
to price per gallon and miles per gallon for Britain and Germany
(keeping in mind that British gallons are larger and Germans use some
other consumption formula like liters/100km). In other words- if you've
already done the math post it here.
Thanks,
Al Brase
