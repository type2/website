I bought one of these a few weeks ago and haven't been able to get it
to fit in my bus (73). I have heating ducts in the doors that are
making it impossible to mount against the front of the bus. I'm
waiting for a response on how to make it work, so I guess I'll let you
know when I know.

They do look incredibly cool and useful though, I'm just hoping that
it will actually fit.
