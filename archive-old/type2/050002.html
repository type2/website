Hi,

We've a rather bizarre symptom occurring on our 72 bus.

When we are driving it feels as if the accel cable is sticking.
You take your foot off the pedal, and the bus keeps going, sometimes
actually speeding up.

If you step on the clutch, at best it idles too high, at worst roars at high
rpm, regardless how fast you were going.

The only way to stop it is either to jab the accel pedal, or smoothly &quot;floor
it&quot; and let off, and then it will idle down.

We greased the accel linkage, with no difference.

Any suggestions.  1982 T4 motor, with dual 34 carbs.  I know they are not
quite in sync, but it runs smooth, and gets 22 mpg.
