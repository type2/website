Subject: Gray plastic cover thingy??

     Hey volks, what is this thing?  Gray, about 12 inches long, maybe 2-3 
inches wide, with squeeze clips.  It has rounded corners, and was setting in 
the battery tray.  part 211 945 285, which I googled and all I can find is 
that it's a &quot;Cap&quot;.

     It reads &quot;Abdeckung nach hintenabziehen&quot; which babel fish translates to 
&quot;Cover after in the back-taken off&quot;

What is it, and where do I put it (be nice please :-)?
