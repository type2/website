Said Steve Blackham: (to message below)
Why is a EGR filter required at all.  I have three other VWs (a1 &amp; A2s) and
a Ford Bronco which have EGR valves but no filters on them.  Why is the
Type 2 so special.  I wonder if this is just profit item only and not
really necessary.  Wouldn't a direct tube  be satisfactory?
Any experts on this subject?

No expert here, just common sense.......Do your other cars feed the exhaust
to the air intake before the air filter or after, into the throttle, like
VW does?  Are the passage tubes of similar size?  Apparently one does not
want these gasses fed into the idle curcuit, so in VW it's shut off at idle
by the throttle linkage.  Considering how the heat riser on type I engines
plug up, carbon must be a factor....perhaps it's to prevent narrowing of
the piping BEFORE the exhaust gets past the throttle?  One doesn't &quot;need&quot;
it for the system to work, but it may be needed to keep it working optimally!

--[ ORIGINAL MESSAGE ]-----------------
&gt;Upon inspection of the 1975 bus I have,  (about 60K on it) I found that
&gt;one side of the still existing EGR filter was completely rusted thru so I
&gt;could pull it away- pulled out the innards, which is a pad  about 4.5 by 4
&gt;inches, an inch thick- made up of either copper or bronze fibers .004&quot;
&gt;thick and ribbon shaped under a microscope.  Looks like a &quot;Brillo pad&quot;
&gt;with the fibers horizontal to the vertical flow of gas.
&gt;The pad is thus about 15 cubic inches allowing for the tapering at the
&gt;sides- and had a lot of powdery black stuff embedded in the end proximal to
&gt;the muffler.  It is likly exhaust filtrate and explains why it probably was
&gt;given a 30K replacement requirement?   If one can find a source of bronze
&gt;wool that won't migrate as fibers, then a functional filter for exhaust
&gt;recirculation should be fabricable?
