Subject: RE: sunroof instead of a poptop

A standard roof and a sunroof (same as sliding roof) are two different
animals.  If you want to stay vw, you would have to chop your roof and
replace, otherwise you could get a cheap pop up roof from an auto parts
store.  I am sure all the purists are grinding their teeth right now, and so
am I.

&gt; I am in the process and it is very simple.  Sunroofs at the vw shows rage
&gt; from $100 - $300 with the rails and everything.  Easy job though.

English is not my native language so I don't know all the &quot;car-terms&quot;
you talk about, sorry. Is a sunroof the same as a sliding roof? I mean,
you have some sort of sliding door in the roof, an original VW option on
the T2 busses.

I have a 1970 bus in which I want to fit a sunroof from a 1979 bus (I
can't stand that pop-top). What could I do best? Replace the whole roof
unit? 

Does a 1979 roof fit on a 1970 Kombi?
I hear it is not much work by over here I heard people say it is and
actually when I look at the roof from underneat, it looks rather
different than a standard roof.
