somebody wheezed:

&gt;I know there are exceptions but in general most mechanics belong in the
penitentiary.

Ok..maybe I agree..but..I understand where this shop is coming from....

I once got a call from another machanic who I knew to help him out..is
daughter and her boy friend had trouble with their bus after coming from
colorado to New Yourk..could I fix it for them?

Sure,,the deal was that it was blowing by the heads so bad it wouldnt run..but
it had been rebuilt in colorado just before the trip..fine..looked clean and
it was all there..een the theremostat...great..Two rebultt heads, resurface
teh tops of the cylindrs..check the case mounting surface for the jugs
hammering..hmm looke dgood...(The typicla no money deal..do as little as
possible..) heck..the heads cam loose..ok fine ...driving it back to deliever
it the oil liight comes on she starts pounding...the GD bottom end is tost
too....Arrrrgh..Stop it and call the Mechanic buddy..bring you wrecker..we
gotta more trouble....
Wel teh long and the short of it was that I got paid for the parts and no
labor...the bus sat over night anf the stereo got boosted....everyone was mad
at *me* because I thought that the jerk in Colorado had done a good job...and
I belived the owner that the rest of the engine was fine..no noise or oil
lights and like that....duh....
I will never do half a VW engine..all or nothing pal...
Another fella runs a british car place..a father and son team come in &quot;How
much to rebuild a TR-7 engine?' asks the Dad..(the son is squriming)  'About
$3500&quot;..
(He got their attendsion..Abab,abbbaH how come so *much*!?!!?!&quot;
Well, your engine is shot..so you need to get a junk yard core&quot; (they &quot;OK'd
all these points as he went on) 'And you going to rebuilt that one because it
is only *slightly* better than what you have&quot; Rings, bearings and like
that..and a valve job?&quot;  New valves of course&quot;...New water pump? new
hoses..tune up stuff? new motor mounts...you not putting this engine back in
on the old ones...really silly not to do a clutch while the things
out.....rebuild or replace the radiator..don't want to risk overheating the
new engine, do we?...overhaul the starter and generator....oil, fluids..Ummm
yeah maybe 3000....give or take..&quot;
The father-son team were flabergasted..'But..that's more than the *car* is
worth!!!&quot;
&quot;Ummm..yeah...I suspect..&quot;
&quot;Gee..OK..thanks..&quot; and they beat a hasty retreat....
My buddy smiled...If you do less than that *you* will put all that in it for
free...*AND* they will call you a crook for doing it....
