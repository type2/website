&gt; Only downside is that if you are tall (like me, 6'4&quot;) the Vanagon seat will
&gt; raise you up an inch or so.

Same thing will happen if you rebuild your stock seats.  At 6'2&quot; I was
looking right under the upper edge of the side window.  After rebuilding
my seats I found myself looking square at the top of the door!

Still, the comfort is worth having to duck down now and then!
