&gt; I *like* the stock jacks. The only issue I have with them is they're
&gt; not terribly stable so the wheels have to be well chocked to use it.

I like the stock jack too.  The place that people get into trouble is that
they think that the jack will take fore-and-aft loads.  As long as you
properly chock the opposite wheels the stock jack is easy to use.

Now, the bug &quot;monkey climbing a tree&quot; jack is another story.  That's why I
have a bus jack in my bug, too!
