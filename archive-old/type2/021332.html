&gt; Subject: [T2] lost keys
&gt; 
&gt; hi.
&gt; i'm fairly new to the list and a friend of mine needs some advice.
&gt; 
&gt; i own a 1973  campmobile vw. she owns a 1984 vanagon. she's lost her car
&gt; keys. can she get replacements from somewhere? or does she have to go to
&gt; a locksmith?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks.

	The local locksmith was able to quickly match an ignition key
to a door handle I brought into him. It cost about $19. 
 
	Assuming your friend can open the doors, and that the door key
and ignition key were the same, they can quite easily remove the door
handle.
 
	Open the drivers side door. There is a large screw head inline with the
door 
handle on the side of the door.
Remove this screw. The handle should come out. If it doesn't (and right
now I can't
think exactly of the Vanagon due to spending too much time on my Jetta)
there may
be another screw behind the metal trim (if any) on the handle.
 
	Take the handle into a locksmith or dealer. They'll be able to make a
key
from the code on the handle, or hand cut a key to fit. A dealer did mine
for $4 when
I brought them the handle with a code.
 
Good luck.

matt
