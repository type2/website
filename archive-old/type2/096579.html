Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trademarks

Jim,

Can't quite make out if you can actually see the vw logo on it.

If it has the vw logo on it and she painted it, it is verboten.

If it just &quot;looks&quot; like a logo, but is not clearly defined as a vw logo,I 
can't see how they could say anything.

Dave, who can't see that small any more

Cheers

&gt; anyone else jumps in and says that VW has a fair case, one might

&gt; Personally, I think that VW needs to exercise a bit of judgement.
