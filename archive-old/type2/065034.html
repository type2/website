Subject: What they say

Well, children it was back in the seventies:  I often would park my live aboard
'66 in front of the student union building at LSU in Baton Rouge to spend the
night.  In the mornings I would just roll out and go in for breakfast...a real
short commute.  One morning, as a lay abed, I overheard a small group of
students commenting about the van (It had a number of readable things on it
including quotes of the Tao te Ching) One young fellow said, &quot; Hey, I know a guy
who has one of these!&quot;   One of the young female companions (a sorority sister,
I have no doubt) said, &quot; OOO Yuck!  You KNOW someone who has one of THESE!&quot;

Bad as it is to have a counter culture vehicle, it is almost as bad to admit
knowing someone who has one....
