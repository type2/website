Subject: Re: [T2] rapid response to low oil-P

 How does this differ from Japanese/US models with similar sticker
 prices that have several engine options available to the buyer?
You're suggesting that VW made undesirable models to begin with but
wouldn't a choice of engines help sell an underpowered vehicle?
That's why I think it's a mentality. VWoA may have said, &quot;we need a
bigger engine&quot; and I bet VAG would have replied, &quot;why would you need  that?&quot;.

Remember I mentioned the Gas Guzzler Tax?

CAFE [corporate average fuel economy] figures into each model brought in. Asian cars have never had a problem
with it. Euro cars have a big problem with it.

&quot;The current penalty for failing to meet CAFE standards is $5.50 per tenth of a MPG under the target value
times the total volume of those vehicles manufactured for a given model year.

Since 1983, manufacturers have paid more than $590 million in CAFE civil penalties. Most European
manufacturers regularly pay CAFE civil penalties ranging from less than $1 million to more than $20 million
annually. Asian and most of the big domestic manufacturers have never paid a civil penalty.

For MY 2002, five imported passenger car fleets, including BMW, Daimler Chrysler, Fiat, Lotus and Porsche are
projected to fail to meet the 27.5 mpg passenger car CAFE standard. In addition, two light truck fleets,
including BMW and Volkswagen are projected to fail to meet the light truck CAFE standard of 20.7 mpg. &quot;

Did you know that VW offered over 10,000 combinations in the UK?
