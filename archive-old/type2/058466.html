Subject: When Carbs go Snap, Crackle, and Pop.

Hello all,
	I've checked the archives on this several times and found some
useful information.  I've been screwing with this problem for the last 2
weeks to no end.  When I get to 1/4 to 1/2 throttle the carbs backfire
and sputter, so the engine losses power drastically.  Keep in mind I've
only driven this bus twice for any extended period of time.  It's a 74'
westy with stock 1800 and dual solex's, by the way.  The first time the
engine overheated due to lack of compression in the #3 and #4 cylinders. 
The PO (also a fellow listee) gave me his word that the engine &quot;Has good
compression&quot;.  Buyer Beware and stay away from Chris in Allentown, PA. 
	Anyhow, after that mishap I installed a used engine that has good
compression.  I used the original carbs on this &quot;new&quot; engine.  After I
got it running I drove it to work one Friday, about a 25 minute drive. 
Ran fine at first, but then I got this hesitation at points, which at
times I could apply full throttle to get past.  After taking off the air
cleaner assembly and removing the trap door, I drove around the
neighborhood and then realized the hesitation was the backfiring through
the carbs.  Since then I've done the following:
	-Readjusted valves .008exhaust .006intake
	-Set dwell at 50
	-Set timing to spec.
	-Cleaned carbs several times
	-Adjusted carbs several times, They seem to be synchronized
(Accelerator pump and 	 other linkage appear to engage at the same
time) I don't have a Uni-Syn
	-Checked for vacuum leaks.  Was leaking at manifolds and at the
brake servo line.  I 	 tightened manifold bolts and plugged brake
line.
	-Checked to see if distributer was advancing and it is.
	-The engine has a new fuel pump and the carbs have new jets, acc.
pump and gaskets.
	- Also has new plugs, points, coil, and wires.

	Every time I changed something I checked to see that dwell,
timing, idle speed and carbs were adjusted to spec.  I'm frying my brain
trying to figure this one out.  The last thing I want to do is swallow my
pride and take this think to a mechanic.  I'm not going to give up on
this thing.  I've got all the Bibles: Idiot guide, Haynes, and Bentley. 
There very informative but I'm still stuck with this snap, crackle and
pop.  I've had some experience with the type I, but this is my first dual
carb and Type IV engine.  Lets hope the wisdom of the list will prevail
over this problem. TIA.
