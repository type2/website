Subject: Re: [T2] Shocks


&gt; I researched the library and archive and discovered that oil
&gt; shocks need &quot;pumping&quot;.  I
&gt; have pushed &amp; pulled through the stroke on each shock at least
&gt; thirty times now, and
&gt; there seems only to be resistance on the DOWN stroke, almost
&gt; *none* on the UP stroke.
&gt; Is this normal???

Yes, this is normal for a single-action oil shock. They only dampen spring
travel on the down stroke.

Double-action shocks dampen travel in both directions. But I don't know of any
being made.....

&gt; I pulled one of the NAPA HD gas shocks, and checked its stroke:
&gt; solid compression up
&gt; *and* down - in fact, the thing self-extends to top once I've
&gt; pushed it to the bottom.

Correct operating procedure for a gas filled shock.

&gt; Are the NAPA shocks bad?

No, they work as designed. If they were bad, they would not extend.

&gt;Are my BOGE replacement shocks bad?

No, they work as designed.

You are comparing 2 different types of shocks. Gas filled shocks are usually
more bouncey.
