Subject: Strange Oil Level: Epilogue

Hello Again -
Well, for those of you who remember my recent post where I changed my oil
on the road while camping and then noticed how continually &amp; unusually high
my oil level was on my dipstick, and are interested in the result: it's
been kind of inconclusive, but the reason is obvious.  After not being able
to comfortably deal with knowing that my oil was way too full (like, a half
inch above the dipstick's full line) after a normal oil change, I decided
to do it all over again - complete with new filter and all new oil after
only some 150 miles since the change.  When I drained the oil from my
engine, my plastic drain pan seemed fuller than usual and then when I
transferred it into a plastic 1-gallon milk jug (for recycling purposes), I
found that there was so much more oil in there than the other jugs that I
had sitting nearby from other recent oil changes.  Like, way too much more
oil.  I have no idea how so much extra oil could've been in there - it
looks almost as if I put in 4.7 qts rather than 3.7, but I know that is
impossible.  (I'm way too anal for that.) Regardless, after the new oil
change, all is well and levels are now good and normal.  I just wish I knew
how so much extra oil could've gotten in there - I have thought &amp; rethought
that maybe I didn't drain out the old oil long enough the first time
through, but I just don't see how that could've happened as I remember how
long I let it drip, and so slow at that.  And hopefully I did no damage
running my engine on this much oil - can anyone ease my worried mind on
that one?  Thanks once again!
