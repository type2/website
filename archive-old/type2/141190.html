Subject: Re: [T2] 73 to 71 &quot;found an engine&quot;

&gt; Wasn't there a company that made a kit that converted a type IV engine to a type 2 configuration?  They sold 
&gt; a over engine fan (like a bug engine) and all the tin needed to make a bug type engine with a type IV 
&gt; (72-79) block.
Company was something like: Oregon VW,com or Oklahoma Engine,

That was the DTM kit I mentioned. DTM means Down The Middle.
The originater of the kit died. AFAIK, Jake Raby now sells the kit for $650 + $55 shipping.  I was not too far 
off when I said $679.....
