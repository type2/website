Subject: RE: [T2] Upcoming Road Test: Konis, Hankooks and Bar Harbor

&gt; Okay Ron, now you've touched on something I've been meaning
&gt; to ask the list for a long time! Where can I get an accurate tire guage?


The really cheap ones seem to fluxuate quite a bit. I have seen as much as a
5 psi difference from one of those &quot;stick&quot; gauges to another, which makes
them nearly useless (other than telling you if one tire is seriously low).
For under two bucks (and probably a dime to make in China), I wouldn't
expect much more.  I bought a $20 or so one some years ago that seemed to be
accurate (or at least it matched the expensive professional gauge used by my
local VW specialist, which was my frame of reference at the time). But it's
been years since then and at this point I have no idea where I got it, so
I'm afraid I can't recommend a source. The analog gauge built into my
cigarette-lighter powered compressor seems to consistently read about 5%
low, but since it's at least consistent, it still useful with a little bit
of math.
