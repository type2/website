Hi Volks,

I usually just blow stuff like this off, but this is interesting enough that
it might not be considered spam. If you live in a wet climate (like here in
the Pacific Northwest) this might be just the ticket.

Disclaimer:  This just showed up in my mailbox.  Some might consider it spam.
I visited the link.  If you choose to visit it, you'll know EXACTLY as much
about the product and the company as I do.
