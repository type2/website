Look it you see a nipple behind there...should be a thin vacuum line
attached.  If not, it rotted off.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;             To those that havn't replied THANK YOU.  You encouraged me
&gt; to look at the engine myself instead of going right to the shop.
Well,
&gt; I check all the air tubes (That I know of).  Now, I sprayed starter
&gt; fluid into this one aread behing the throttle body.  It seems that
there
&gt; is a T connector where three small air hoses come together.  One of
&gt; those air hoses goes down behind the throttle body.  (Once again, my
&gt; apologies for the lack or correct terminology)  I took pics of the
area
&gt; I am talking about.
http://www.wicals_dot_com/troy/vw/images/airleak%20web/
&gt; I am frantic and apologize for not having time to compress the images.
&gt; When I spray down in that general direction, engine begins to rev
&gt; smoother and then goes back to a rough idle.  Any help on what I
should
&gt; be looking at specifically?  Where can I order these air tubes from?
&gt; Thanks again for all the help.
