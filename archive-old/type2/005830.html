Hey Now-

I'm brand new to this list, and I am in the process of finding my second =
type 2.  After searching and searching for the right bus, I found a very =
intriguing 1973 bus.  The bus is in great shape, but the only thing is =
is that it has an automatic transmission.  I haven't seen very many of =
these, and I wanted to check them out before I bought one.  My question =
is:  Do these buses (or more specifically transmissions) have an OK =
history?  I would like to hear from anyone who has one or has dealt with =
one.  Do you like it/dislike it?  Have you had more or less trouble with =
an automatic than a standard?  Are parts expensive/hard to come by?

Any info is very much appreciated!

Have a Great Day,
Billy
