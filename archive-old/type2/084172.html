Subject: Re: [T2] Contacting Miller FI

Andrew,
I spoke with Gary (his answering machine) yesterday and got two emails from him shortly afterward.
Both came from the gmiller_at_pacifier_dot_com address
Here's his signature from the emails:
----------------
Gary Miller
gmiller_at_pacifier_dot_com
http://www.sandrail_dot_com/millerfi
Miller Fuel Injection
10706 NE 215 Ct
Vancouver Wa
98682
360-944-4422
---------------------
I have also cc'd Gary on this email and if it goes through to him, he most likely will contact you directly.

Hope that helps

Scott

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I looked up the website of Miller Fuel Injection &amp; was very impressed with their products &amp; interested as to how well they'd suit my applications.
&gt; But when I tried to contact Gary Miller his email address on the site kept rebounding on Mailer Daemon &amp; I haven't been able to get through.
&gt; Does any know of another address other than gmiller_at_pacifier_dot_com for Miller FI?
&gt; I wanted to ask Gary some stuff about his products.
