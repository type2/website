Subject: Re: [T2] sell, or store to fix later.

Add some fuel stabilizer to the fuel, disconnect the battery and to  
help keep tires from getting flat spots, over inflate.  i have stored  
mine this way off and on over three years.  Have never had a  
problem.  Also keep the bird doo off to a minimum.  good luck
Peace,
David
