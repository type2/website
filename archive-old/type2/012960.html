Hello All:

I'm in the middle of my first VW engine build, and I've reached a point where I need some help.  The Muir book talks about a spring that goes on the bottom end of the distributor drive shaft, but they don't show a picture of what it looks like.  I went to a local VW junk yard, and the proprietor gave me a spring that looks like a spring from a ball-point pen, except for a little thicker.  I was skeptical, but he insisted that was the correct spring.  Last night I was fitting the spring and distributor shaft into the engine case, and there's no way that this can be the correct spring.  It seems too small, and there's no place in the engine case for it to rest, so it just falls from beneath the distributor shaft.  Does anyone know what the correct spring looks like, and where I can get one fast??

Now, my second question.  The Muir book also refers to some &quot;small square things&quot; that are in the case near the lifters.  I have a re-conditioned case, and there are no &quot;small square things&quot; near where the lifters go.  Is my case missing some parts, or did I misinterpret something??

Thanks,

Jim Hood
