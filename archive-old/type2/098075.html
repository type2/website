Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trends sales call?

I bet its not rates going up, I bet the magazine company is 
trying to make their subscription numbers look good for their 
fiscal year end report to shareholders.

Thanks,
Chris

---- snip ----

Got a call last night ... offering to extend my subscription 
to VW Trends for 3 years for $1.25/issue.

Presumably because the rates were about to go up....hmmm
