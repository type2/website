Subject: Gas Guage Voltage Stabilizer Voltage question

With the help of the archives (fantastic resource, but would be easier if my 
browser's 'back' button worked there) I've narrowed my gas guage problem down 
to a probable voltage stabilizer, but I can't find out what the output 
voltage should be.  Can anyone tell me what the proper voltage range is for 
this unit?
If this turns out to be the problem what years of busses had this same 
stabilizer?  
As all aircooleds are extremely rare in salvage yards around here, where is a 
good place to get one of these in case I can't find one used?
One more question -  with the stabilizer on the back of the speedo like it 
should be, I read empty all the time.  If I take the screw out of it and pull 
it back from the back of the speedo, it reads full always.  Why is this, and 
could it be an indication of a problem elsewhere in the guage/sending unit?
Mny thanks to all of you, and what a great source of info for transporter 
owners.  I only hope that I'm able to contribute to the discussions someday.
Until then I am,
