You're right, I was mistaking the oil pickup tube for the windage tray.  
I had even looked at this picture before but had forgotten all about it.  
(These rebuilds are taking that long!!)  But, it seems clear that the 
Vanagon engines I'm rebuilding never had windage trays; the picture and 
accompanying text in Wilson's book seen to indicate the pickup tube bolts 
to the windage tray through some sort of hole in the &quot;bell&quot; on the 
pickup tube, and neither of the bells on the pickup tubes I have have 
this hole.

&gt; &gt; Both the Vanagon engines I have torn down (well.... one's partially
&gt; &gt; assembled now) had windage trays.  To me, the windage tray looks to be an
&gt; &gt; oil pickup tube that reaches into the sump, with an inverted metal &quot;bowl&quot;
&gt; &gt; down at the pickup end.  I suppose if the oil level in the sump was high
&gt; &gt; enough to cover the hole that the &quot;upper&quot; end of the windage tray pipe
&gt; &gt; goes into, the oil pump could suck oil even with the tray missing.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; None of the manuals I have shows a picture of the windage tray, but at
&gt; &gt; least one of them (Haynes??) mentions it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; The windage tray is shown in Tom Wilson's book on how to rebuild your
&gt; volkswagen engine.  It even explains the purpose of it, which is to keep
&gt; the crank from picking up all the oil in the sump.  It also keeps the
&gt; oil from all going to one side when you go around a corner.
