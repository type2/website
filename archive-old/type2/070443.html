Subject: pop top roof curvature comparisons?

Howdy all. I have seen several split-windows with late model pop-tops, and they
seem to fit the curvature fine. I believe that the horizontal curve over the
nose is different, but I am more referring to the vertical profile. I want to
know if this curvature is the same from split window busses through the late
models.
The reason that I am asking is that the one thing I don't like about my '67
camper (NOT A WESTFALIA) is the small pop-top, so I would like to add a double
bed top if possible. I know I don't want to mess with a later Westy top, as I
don't want to get into all the cutting and welding. However, I know of several
companies such as Riveria, and some others that have the double upper bed that
sits on top of the roof, with the standard smaller hole. that's what I am
looking for, unless I can score a Dormobile top.
 Anyway, any information is appreciated, as well as any leads on pop-tops with
beds available...
