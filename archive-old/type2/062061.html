Subject: Joel, change the stats!

It has come to this.  I am the proud? owner of another '71 bus.  This 
one mostly parts.  Some quite good.

About three weeks ago I heard of a '71 bus needing a clutch and a new 
owner.  Could this be the mechanics special I had been looking for?  
It was more like a mechanics and body special.  Bus had heavy rust AND
collision damage.  The upside is that it had an AVP rebuild installed 
about 28,000 miles ago.  Also it had a 3/4 roofrack that was screaming
to be bolted to my bus.  I checked the bus out slightly and made an 
offer on the rack.  The father would check with the son and I would 
get back to them.

While all this was happening I happened to be talking with Erin Lasley
about a Fastback that he knows about for sale.  A friend of mine is 
interested in this.  I happened to ask Erin if he knew anyone looking 
for a good used engine.  It so happened that he was!  I told him I 
would get back to him.

Well, the owner of the '71 knew I wanted the rack.  They also knew 
they wanted rid of that bus.  No to the rack offer, make another on 
the whole package.  A price was agreed upon, only be finalized after I
got to check out the engine.  Saturday was the day of the engine 
checking.  In a fit of hope I cleared a spot in the garage for the 
beast and set out to diagnose things.  I pulled out the Champion plugs
and put in some properly anti-siezed bosch plugs and adjusted the 
valves.  The goal was to get the thing running long enough to warm it 
up a bit for a proper compression test.  After much cranking and 
timing changes the thing coughed to life.  The tests showed 
125,130,110,125.  110 is a good number, not the best when another is 
130 but good nonetheless.  This engine has some miles left in it.  A 
call was made to Erin to make sure the deal was good and then the call
to the owner to finalize things.

Wednesday I pick the thing up.  Actually it is going to be towed to my
house.  The first thing I will do is pull the engine and rack.  The 
second thing I will do is pull the rest and ready the thing for the 
junkers.  I feel better about this than I did at first.  After getting
intimate with the thing for a couple of hours on Saturday I realized 
the condition of it.  If this were a '54 Ambulance it might be 
worth a stab at restoration but I can't see it on this thing.  It is 
about as rusty as Thom's bus but with huge dents all around.

I will keep you all posted on the good bits I pull from this bus.  In 
a fit of universal balance yet another friend of mine enquired last 
night if I knew the location of a good used bus tranny.  Jim
