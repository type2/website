Hi Jeremiah,

Borrow or rent a compression tester if you can't afford to buy one. 
They aren't all that expensive. The compression test will tell you if 
your problem is with some parts you can't see without a complete 
teardown: Valves, rings, piston and cam.

I put the injector swap ahead of the compression test because it's not 
hard to do and doesn't cost anything. But the compression test should 
be done anyway... it's good benchmark data for the health of your 
engine.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; forgive my ignorance,  why would i want to test compression?  couldn't 
&gt; the

&gt; was dry when i pulled it.  wouldn't this indicate no fuel being 
&gt; sprayed into
&gt; the chamber?  this speculation is mostly wishful on my part since i 
&gt; have no
&gt; tools with which to test the compression and can't afford a mechanic
&gt; presently.  anyway, thanks for your time and knowlegde.
