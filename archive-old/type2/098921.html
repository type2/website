Subject: RE: [T2] Brake Calipers

Hi all,
&gt; The Bentley mentions using VW brake grease when re-building the brake
&gt; callipers. I didn't find any mention of it in the archives.
&gt; Does anyone know if this is still available, or a replacement for it?

My brake shop (a fairly comprehensive place) had never heard of it, but
they did have brake lubricant that was like a thick oil.  That worked
fine.
