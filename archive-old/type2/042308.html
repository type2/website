Hi,

 &gt; I am interested in purchasing a VW Bus here in my local area (Akron, OH).
I was collecting all the information that I could, and I was just curious
about MPG to expect from a bus. One that I am seriously  considering is a
1973 with of course a 1700cc engine. Does anyone know what to expect?
