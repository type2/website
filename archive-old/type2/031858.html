&gt; The generator backing plate is made for a 38 amp BUS generator but the
&gt; generator is  a 30 amp B*G model...
&gt;
&gt; try that. It should show up as an indention in the backing plate to
&gt; accomodate the longer 38 amp gen.  There's pics on the Hon. Ron Van
&gt; Ness's Rebuild pages in the library.


Keep in mind too that the fan hub is offset too to keep it from being
grossly out of adjustment when installing the indented backing plate.  I'm
always looking for this kind of stuff at swaps - core engines that might
have the 38 amp generator and funky backing plate.  Hard stuff to find
otherwise.
