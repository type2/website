Subject: head temp sender??

So after i pulled the head off of my 72 bus, i noticed that there was this 
spot above cyl. 3 that had been drilled and there is a little thing with a 
wire coming off of it in it. its like tapped in there. anyways im just 
guessing that this is for a temperature sender right?? well i was just 
curious as to what i would need to finish it and set it up in my bus. Is 
there just something that vdo sells that i just run a wire from to the front 
of my car?? im not sure exactly what i would need and i am just asking you 
guys. sorry but i ddint have time to think about how i would ask this 
question and it probably sounds really wierd. well i just hope you guys can 
understand it and can let me konw what i need. thanks

joey
