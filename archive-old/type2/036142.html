Subject: 70 westy for sale in Belvidere, il

Awhile back i told the list about a 70 westy in Belvidere, iL that was a very 
nice and one of a kind bus. I finially got a picture of the bus. The picture 
i have of the bus is from the 80's but it looks the same now as in the 
picture. Since it was parked soon after the picture was taken. I will have a 
few more pics soon but for right now anyone who is interested in this bus 
take a look at it. 

Bus can be seen at:

Any questions about the bus please ask. 

thanks
