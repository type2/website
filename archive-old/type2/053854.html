Subject: FREE Westy interior... &quot;U&quot; remove

I have a 1971 Westphalia interior that I would like to have removed, as I am 
going to build my own back in it's place. I am overseas... the vehicle is 
below New Orleans in storage, and it will take some coordination on my part 
and yours, and the storage area for you to get in and do the job.

ONLY VERY INTERESTED PERSONNEL INQUIRE... NO MAYBES OR DREAMERS.
