After
I put the new oil in, i tried getting oil pressure with the plugs out
and i couldnt so i had to remove the &quot;in&quot;-(the hose coming from the
pump) oil hose from my external oil filter(my engine is full flowed). I
filled the hose with oil and even cleaned the nipple and blew air into
the hose and refilled it with oil several times to make sure the gears
on the pump were covered in oil.  After that i got oil pressure and was
on my way.  On the very short ride home the light didnt flicker or come
on.  I took the car out the next day and the same thing happened. 


             What make of oil filter are you using? 
If the oil is consticted there that may be the problem.
