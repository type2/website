Subject: Re: [T2] Water Injection

As I understand it, compressed natural gas (CNG) has an octane rating of about
130. It seems that a turbocharged 2800+cc Type 4 engine with, say, a 14.5:1
compression ratio, running CNG and water-injection would be pretty hard to
beat.

A friend of mine who has a VW shop in Texas won some major national sand drag
races running a sand dragster with a supercharged 2400+ cc VW Type I motor,
using methanol as the fuel. The V8 Chevy guys really resented the fact that a
VW-powered dragster was kicking their butts. Seems like CNG (which is
primarily methane) would a be a simpler and better fuel to use than methanol
or propane.

&gt; Side benefit: Keeps things clean as the carbon deposits are much reduced in
&gt; a water injected engine.  That has been the report, anyway.

&gt;    I wonder how far you could &quot;push&quot; a water-injected, propane (100+
octane) engine...Another list I'm on has a few members that race pro-
pane powered racers and swear by it... ;-)
