You can locate all your refinishing needs at any local automotive body
shop supply house---everything except the foam roller and brushes---

In days of yore, the painter's id use a product by the name of &quot;Japan&quot;
paint--and it was brushed on, wet sanded, and repeated again and
again---too time consuming, too labor intense.

I think this stuff was a lacquer based product, and not very durable for
everyday use.

Forget the POR primer CA-CA----
Get a gallon of Dupont's Vari-Prime, acid etch, zinc chromate primer.
This stuff will lock down any corrosion, and prevent any from re
occuring----good stuff.

Rent a Booth?

Two chances---slim and none---

Set up a fan in your garage, or shed, in a window, this will clear out
any overspray---

If you use PPG's urethane paints --(Concept) the set up time is
short--so the material will be dust free in a matter of minutes----more
good stuff, and will give you a long lasting durable finish---

I use a Binks #7 gun--the best fora lay down flat finish.
HLVP guns lay down a concrete block type finish----High volume low
pressure guns spit paint---just as the name implies lots of wet sanding
to get a nice finish.

One more thing---hold on to your shorts, when the tab appears for the
equipment and materials---

Them red's your looking at ain't cheap---

your talking about $238.00 per gallon, plus catalyst, plus reducer, plus
the Vari prime, plus the fill primer, plus the DA,and paper, plus the
tape, masking paper, plus the compressor and the gun, plus the finishing
stuff---( wet sand paper, rubbing compound, polishing material, buffer,
pads, etc )

The time you will have wrapped up in this project won't be nothing to be
laughing at either----mucho timo-----

Pay the piper, and have a shop do it----

Have fun----

Later,


Terry

bus myself... 
Hi, 
I'm going to paint my '69 bus and after asking around at body shops in
the Boston area, I decided to 
do it myself. (the shops that would take the job were asking over $3000,
way over my budget) 
I have some questions: 
1) Where can I buy the paint. I'm looking for the '69-'70 Montana Red
(L30H), the '68 Titian Red (L555) or the '71 Chianti Red (L31H). The bus
was originally Lotus White (L282) but it has been red for as long as I
remember 
=A0=A0=A0=A0(the bus has been in the familly for the past 25 years). 
2) I'm planning on stripping the old paint, then use POR-15 directly on
the bare metal, followed by primer, sealer and 
topcoat, with appropriate sanding in between. How much paint would I
need for the whole bus? Should I use single or 
double stage paint for the topcoat? Should I use a conventional or a
HVLP spray gun? 
4) Does anyone knows if there is a place in the Boston, New England or
New York area where I could 
rent a spay booth to apply the topcoat? (Like they have in CA) I have
access to a small garage at a friend's house, but I'm concerned about
the ventilation, temperature, humidity, etc, etc... 
5) Regarding alternatives to spraying, has anybody heard of using (or
used) foam rollers to apply the paint? Long 
time ago, when we wanted to achieve a really shiny finish on furniture,
we would use cloth to apply abound 10 
coats of varnish and the surface would be almost glass like, and we only
used 220grit sand paper.... 
Any comments, advice and information is very welcomed. Thanks a lot 
Rogelio
