Subject: Bye-bye, VWs!

That's it! I've had it! I'm through with volkswagens for good!  I've sold
the '71! (Gave the guy a good deal, too!) I'm finished with these
Volkswagens! They're supposed to be so economical and sensible, but we all
spend our weekends pampering them...tweaking this, adjusting that,
painting this, looking for this part or that. &quot;Oh man! I've just GOT to
have that $300 AM radio! And those semaphores! Hey, don't look at me like
that; I'll get something that uses semaphores someday...&quot;

You're all a bunch of VW addicts. You know your m-codes by heart. You can
rattle off the toll-free numbers of parts dealers in four or five states.
You know the location of every part on your bus. You can spot an idle
adjustment screw in a box of miscellaneous parts from 8 feet away...and
you can tell if it's still good by looking at it.

You go slowly up hills and wear heavy clothes to keep warm in the winter. 
I know some of you have gas heaters, but even those of you who do will
crawl under your bus in the snow to check your valves (and now you're
thinking &quot;but I heard a bad noise in there&quot;).  Face it, man!  You're
junkies.  You couldn't quit even if you wanted to!  Your bus is the monkey
on your back---hmmm...maybe that's why so many of you like that druggie
music. You've all got a vdubaddiction! 

Not me! I CAN QUIT ANYTIME I WANT TO. I don't NEED VWs. I don't have to
succumb to the peer pressure. I'm my own man! I can drive a Buick with
pride. There! I said it: BUICK! Buick! buick.

Come to think of it, you all need someone like me around to keep you from
killing yourselves with this insane addition! Look at what almost happened
to Bob Hufford. &quot;I can do it, man. Just one more bus. Okay, so a cherry
23-window deluxe...but just one, man.&quot; All this and THE MAN is already
breathin' down his back! NO INOPERABLE VEHICLES, Bob!

You guys really DO need help. Okay, I'll go out slowly. I'll go ahead and
pick up that '67 camper I looked at last Friday. But I'm doing it for you
guys. I don't *need* this bus. I can quit *anytime* I want to. I'm not an
addict! You guys, you need help, though. 

Hey, bustender, pass me that 13mm wrench. 8) Joe

P.S. I know where there's a '62 Sundial camper for $400 (maybe $350) if
     anyone needs a fix.
