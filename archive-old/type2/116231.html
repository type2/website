Subject: 412 motor in a 75 bus

Hi Volks,

I have an opportunity to pick up an affordable low-milage 412 engine 
for my Dad's 1975 westy project. (&quot;Franklin&quot;). This past spring we tore 
into the westy motor and discovered it needed a bottom end rebuild, 
since then it's languished through camping season as we've been too 
busy to do much work on it. The 412 engine has less than 1200 miles on 
it but has been sitting in a heated garage for over a decade. (The 412 
was undriveable due to rear-end collision damage the PO never got 
around to repairing.) It turns over but does not run as the fuel pump 
isn't working. We're getting the entire engine with all tin and FI, 
engine wiring harness, etc.

I'm looking for info on what will be involved in the engine install. I 
still haven't seen this motor, Dad will be picking it up this 
afternoon. We have all the tin from the 1.8L engine that was in the bus 
originally, plus the original bus's 1975 FI.  Is it a straight drop in, 
or will we have to swap the tin/engine hanger/alternator/muffler/etc??

If anyone is looking for 412 parts, please let me know and I'll see 
what's available; I'm told it is in very good condition. The car is 
located in Coburg Ontario.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
