&gt; &gt; As a period accessory, the original side tent rocks.

&gt; &gt; But as a camping tent, it's nowhere near as good an investment as the
&gt; &gt; modern side tents. I have heard it referred to as the &quot;Divorce Tent&quot;,
&gt; &gt; as it's so heavy and cumbersome to set up.
&gt;
&gt; I had a Westy tent and agree that it was a PITA to set up. When I got it I
&gt; set it up in the parking lot in broad daylight with all the time in the
&gt; world. Took 2 hours the first time, over an hour the second time.
&gt;
&gt; I just can't imagine getting to the site at 9pm (typical for my family) and
&gt; trying to set the thing up in the dark. Ugh.

yup I had one and the only time I actually camped in it was when I stayed
in one place for almost a week, but I put it up the morning AFTER I had
arrived.

it was still in the bus when I sold it...
