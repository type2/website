make sure you are using the washers - there are two required under both bolt 
heads...

First a little copper washer for each bolt goes on the bolt then a large 
washer with 2 holes is shared between adjacent bolts.

Each of the six bolts should be done up to 25footpounds of torque.

If you still have problems then replace the bolts (they come in  the CV boot 
kits along with the little washers and the grease any way - in UK) any 
further problems would indicate partialy striped threads - maybe a previous 
owner or garage mechanic has been hamfisted and over tightened them.

Good luck
