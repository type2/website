Hi all,

     I have the opportunity to get a 86 westy with a bad motor for =
$3000.  The guy is planning on having it re-built this coming week at =
Heckmann-Theimann's.  Then he will want $6000.  How easy is this thing =
to re-build?  I have never even owned a water-cooled VW.  How would it =
compare price &amp; work wise to converting it to a inline motor?  Any input =
or suggestions would be helpful.
