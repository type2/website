&gt;With the wing vent latches in backwards I now have the added security
update
&gt;of the latch handle crossing the stationery vertical bar that is adjacent
to
&gt;the rear most edge of the vent glass.
&gt;
&gt;I'm over it. Vintage anal Nazis and folks assembling a raffle bus see the
&gt;previous post.

Ah yes, grasshopper. The single cab is also sporting this security MX-code.
It appears to function well, although I don't recall ever actually opened
the wing vents. A notorious bus trader once remarked unkindly about them, so
I gave him a wedgie. End of story. Most people don't notice, and the ones
who do can be trained not to comment on it.
