Subject: RE: [T2] Just picked up my new Bus....

&gt; As for the body... it's actually in SUBSTANTIALLY good condition. I am VERY
&gt; impressed with the condition of the body. I knew the guy before I bought the

This is really most important and good.

&gt;
&gt; When you say re-keyed... where would I get them rekeyed? Would I need to
&gt; take them to a lock smith? I didn't realize you could do this. Since this
&gt; e-mail, I went ahead and ordered a set of matching drivers side and
&gt; passenger side front door handles with the matching locks. I'd like to get a
&gt; set of blanks (they also sell them) and then have the rear hatch and the
&gt; sliding (commando door) door re-keyed.

as far as rekeying the locks. If you are patient and just a little
mechanical you can do it yourself. save all the old locks for parts. In
the type2_dot_com library there should be info that will get you going on the
locks also just ask questions. they are pretty simple. you wont need
blanks. just make all of the door locks match the same key that your new
handles have. If you dont want to do it yourself there are a couple
locksmiths on the list that do it.
