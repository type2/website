Subject: Where the busses are

I took some advice today, and visited with Frank Tyler, here in Eugene 
OR. I understand that many of you on Prodigy will remember him from the 
VW discussion groups there. He's quite a &quot;character&quot; and we chatted for 
a few hours about busses, his VW collectables, and such... and he knows 
more about vans than I ever hope to know.

He has a &quot;hot rod&quot; bus, a 60, as I recall. The original tranny has been 
removed, replacing it and the reduction gears w/ one from a beetle. W/ a 
highly modified engine for power, the bus's front end had to be lowered 
to match the now lower rear end. A bus he drove from back east, with 
Westfalia interior, luggage rack, external tent, and such... it looks 
like it could be quite a rig.

Let's see... there was a single cab in one garage, a 411 in another 
garage, a 60 and 59 sitting out back w/ the hot rod... and a 74 
Westfalia keeping them company. Out front, a couple other busses graced 
the driveway. It's no wonder I haven't seen any around. &lt;grin&gt; For 
protection... there's the manditory dog that loves to chew on would-be 
thieves. &lt;grin&gt;

This is the first day of serious rain... and I guess it brought out the 
busses. I saw 3 on the way down main street, more than I've seen in a 
single day in a long time.

I also stopped by another shop on the way (stumbled across just 
yesterday by my friend), and there were at least a dozen Westfalias, a 
double door 60's model, and another splittie lining the driveway. I also 
got a lead on a couple other sites that might yield a bus.

All told, an interesting but unfruitful day.
