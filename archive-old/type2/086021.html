Subject: Re: [T2] Still having problems with clutch install...

Hi Karl,

No tube -- I've got the ring on the pressure plate, flat faced bearing, and 
the flat side of the disc (that reads &quot;flywheel&quot;) facing the flywheel.

Should the bus be in gear or out of gear when reassembling? I had it in 
neutral both times. What else would cause the shaft not to match up to the 
hub on the clutch disc?

Thanks for the help!

Sean

&gt;Does the pressure plate have a ring on fingers in the center?
&gt;Does the transaxle have a tube that the throw-out bearing rides on?
&gt;It is hard to see what you have mis-matched.....
&gt;70 should have no tube, so it should have a ring on the pressure plate and 
&gt;a
&gt;flat-faced bearing.
&gt;If you have a tube, you should have no ring and a curved face bearing. This
&gt;bearing holder is longer to make up the distance for no ring on the plate.
&gt;The flat side of the disc goes towards the flywheel.
&gt;The side where the center hub is farther out from the friction material 
&gt;goes
&gt;to the plate side.
