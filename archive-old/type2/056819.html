Hello Jack,

&lt;On a recent trip of 75 miles on the interstate,  the oil temperatuure in

&lt;Does anyone have actual experience running at temperatures this high?
&lt;Should I pull the engine and rebuild to a 1600, kissing off my substantial

 From my point of wiew 240 is on the high side. My old 1776 was runnig
those temps too before the installation of a external oil cooler.(a´la Bob
Hoover) The oil cooler helped to get the oil temp down, but finally the
block got a 3 inch crack behind the flywheel in front of cyl#3. Don´t know
if that was because of high temperature or the fact that it was an old &quot;X
marked&quot; block that was rebuilt at least once before. The total life of this
engine lasted for about 25000 miles. Everything except for the block is
still in good shape.

 I´m now using a &quot;bastard&quot; engine with single port heads and 88mm barrels
and the oil temp is not much lower than with the 1776cc engine.

 My plan is to convert to type4 instead of screaming type1 engines. Going
to use the 1776 parts for my Bug project instead.
