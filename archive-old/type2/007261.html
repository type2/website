In my continuing series of posts designed to bore old hands to tears and 
distraction, I provide the following warning to newbies and near-newbies 
like myself. 

If you haven't done so (and you should have done so, to check your fuel 
hoses), slide under the rear wheel of your bus, on the passenger side, 
and wiggle over to just under the starter. Bring a flashlight with you. 
Shine it up at the terminals on the solenoid. If there is any fraying of 
the wires connecting to terminal 30 (the threaded post), or corrosion, 
this is a failure waiting to happen.

The fix is to get a new battery wire from your FLAPS, and to get suitable 
guage wire (12?) with terminal connectors attached to them. Replace the 
battery wire, and splice in the others using soldered connections and 
shrink tubing. These wires are important for starting your bus, charging 
the battery, and running the heater blower. Two out of three of these are 
really, really important (though if you haven't checked your fuel hoses 
yet, it might be better for your bus if it neither started nor charged 
its battery).

Following the lead of the indefatiguable George Lyle, I would be willing 
to compile a list of 10 or 20 &quot;must&quot; maintenances checks for baywindows, 
and post it once a week, as George had kindly done with usefuls URLs. Old 
hands could just delete on sight. Anyone interested?
