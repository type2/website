Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Early detection of fire in engine compartment

Marcus,

been there and done that...in a 67 I once owned.  The brass fitting
**did** come out of the carb...with the new fuel line still firmly
clamped to it.

I actually leaned in and blew out the fire(I was *much* younger then)
and went and bought new ign wires and fuel hose.  Went back,
put them in, hammered  the fitting back into the carb and drove off.

Whenever I work on a carb like that now, that is the first thing I do.
The second thing is to tap the accelerator pump fuel injection
nozzle down with a punch and hammer so it doesn't fall down the intake and 
into the engine.

Sorry about your splity.  :-((

Cheers, dave

&gt; Note that this camper actually had new fuel lines. Maybe the brass fuel
&gt; line fitting fell out of the carb. But who knows - it's pretty hard to
&gt; diagnose a melted down engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Always having at least one fire extinguisher on board is the lesson
&gt; that I learned.
