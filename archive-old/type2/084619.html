&gt;My experienced non-VW mechanic friend came over to look at rods and crank 
&gt;(rods still installed on crank).  He pushed and pulled the rods 
&gt;perpindicular to the crank, was very surprised that he could feel no slop.
&gt;Especially when I told him the engine has 239,000 miles on it.  Do I need 
&gt;to have a machinist look at the crank?  Do the rods usually require 
&gt;machining?

Usually they are just checked for straightness, perhaps shot-peened as an 
upgrade.  Not really necessary for a stock motor though.  You might 
consider checking the bearing clearances on the big end of the rods with 
plastigage before you rebuild, just to have as a data point.

&gt;I have bearings for the crank end on the rods.  Do I need some kind of 
&gt;bushing for the wrist pin end?  Don't I have to remove the gear from the 
&gt;crank to change out center bearings?

Yes, and yes.  I think the bushings in the small end are pressed in and 
perhaps honed to fit.  If yours are still a snug fit, you may not need new 
ones.

&gt;My case is in pretty good shape (I had a Type I specialist here in town 
&gt;look at it).  He thought it looked pretty good, recommended packing it up 
&gt;(says he trusts no one here in Houston) and shipping it to Rimco in 
&gt;California for them to torque it up and test for ovality in the center 
&gt;saddles, align bore if necessary.

Shipping to Rimco to be checked sounds like an unnecessary expense to 
me.  I bet that will run you $400.  If the engine hasn't been abused, it's 
very unlikely that it will need to be align-bored.  Type 1 cases need it 
all the time because they are magnesium and not as strong.  A type 1 
specialist is probably just in the habit of telling people to do it.

&gt;There are some slight discolorations on the saddles, and you can see where 
&gt;a part number from one of the main bearings has become imprinted onto the 
&gt;saddle itself.

Normal.

&gt;OK, big question now:
&gt;If I have to have my case align-bored and they remove .00X&quot;, and then I 
&gt;have to have my crank machined and they remove .00Y&quot;, where do I find 
&gt;bearings that are .00X&quot; bigger on the case side and 00Y&quot; smaller on the 
&gt;crank side?

The Y dimension comes in standard oversizes but I don't have a clue about 
the X dimension.

&gt;If only the crank is machined, where do I get &quot;standard&quot; oversize bearings?

Standard VW parts houses should have them.  Try RMMW.

&gt;If the case needs to be align bored, wouldn't it be better to buy a new 
&gt;one?  Can a new Type IV case be had?

Shouldn't be necessary - I saw new ones for sale many years ago in Calif. 
but not recently.  I would bet money that yours is fine though.
