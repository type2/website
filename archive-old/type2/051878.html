Subject: 72 bumper bracket

Hey all-
Someone a while back offered to pull a rear bumper bracket off an extra 72
they
had.
I have switched computers, lost the email address, but still need it if it's
available.
So if you are that one special person...
Would you be my valentine and send me a P-mail?

oh uh, regarding the Bumper Brackets of course  ; )

Thanks!
