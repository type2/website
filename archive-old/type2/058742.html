Subject: More on Jets, Steering

V,

Regarding steering play, please check all related components before
charging into adjusting the steering box itself.  As mentioned in previous
posts, the draglink ends.  But also, all four tie-rod ends, the king pin
bushings (the ones center of the front beam), the actual mounting bolts and
frame around the steering box for looseness or cracking, the dampner, the
rubber isolation ring above the box, and very importantly, the ball joints
or in the case of splitties, the king pins and associated bushings out at
the wheels.  Also very importantly, the wheel bearings, and wheels and
tires.  The steering box comes last.  I've had very little success
adjusting the actual box, whenever I've tried, there inevitably ends up
being a tight spot or bind somewhere in the travel, not good or worth it.
Replace the lube if you want, but don't do anything drastic to the box, if
it's bad, replace it.  

Get your SO or buddy to crank the wheel back and forth and check everything
for play.  Replace anything icky, tie rods are fairly cheap.  Look closely
at the center king pin (also called a swing arm pivot I think), there
should be no rocking, this is all in the Muir book.   One thing not
mentioned in the Muir book is that if you do replace the king pin bushings
you need to REMOVE THE GREASE NIPPLE!  Nothing like bashing endlessly up
into the bushings only to find you've been gouging a huge notch in the old
bushing as you beat it past the bit of grease nipple that protrudes inside
the beam.  Without that thing in the way they come out like butter.  After
you get all that done, have it aligned at a shop, measuring across the
tires just isn't accurate enough.

On the subject of ongoing jet changes, I re-installed the 60 idle jets
(1600cc weber 34 ICT blah blah) and lo &amp; behold, the light throttle and off
idle response has indeed returned to it's previous smooth response.  The
running mix seems better too for some unknown reason.  I'm trying to stick
to one change at a time so thats the way I'll post them.  Besides, I'm too
busy to fool with the car, I've the luxury of being able to ride my bike to
work these days and parking sucks.
