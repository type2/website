&gt; Could it possibly be that the alternator belt is loose and slipping?  This
would cause a lower voltage output. Or maybe its just time for a new
alternator?
&gt; Here is the old stand-by... check all your grounds.

Since this was also a problem with the old headlights, I started checking
the grounds.  Haven't found anything amiss yet.  Didn't think to check the
alternator belt (duh), but will this afternoon.  Thanks.
