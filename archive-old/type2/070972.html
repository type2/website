Subject: big problemo
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have a 72 Bus with T4 engine in it.  Well my problem is when I'm driving 
the car it seems to bog out like it's getting no gas then it just kicks back 
in and starts driving fine, and then no more then 30 seconds later it does it 
again.  I just changed the fuel pump cause I know the old one was bad and I 
also changed the fuel filter but it still runs crappy.  I thought it was a 
fuel problem, I guess not.  The bus also backfires and I've been told that 
it's probably the timing, could this be why it bogs out too?  Or could it be 
an electrical problem. What should I do?  Please help.

Thank You,
Jon
