&gt; Hi,
&gt; That is about where I found it. I would guess it keeps you pressing the
&gt; pedal too far down. Have not noticed this on other buses. Anybody else have
&gt; one?

Yes, my 69 double cab has one, the only one I've ever seen. I don't know
if other years had them or not. The double cab was a relatively
unmolested 1 owner when I got it in 86.
