Subject: A little wood on you bus?
Message-Id: &lt;199907021521.IAA29063_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I keep thinking of places where I could get a little wood on or in my 
bus. Here are some of them:

1. Replace the chrome molding on early baywindow deluxes with wood 
(maple, teak, rosewood?)

2. A wooden hatch

3. Wooden hatch with attached wooden bicycle rack

4. Wood frames around jalousie windows

5. Wooden engine hatch

6. A wood VW emblem (how long would that last?)

7. Woody-style poptop

8. Wood guage box over windshield (like David Schwarze's, but maybe only 
	center section

9. Wooden visors


What else?
