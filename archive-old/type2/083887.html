Subject: Tips On Storing a VW

Hello Everyone--

Well the selling and Adoption process is going rather slowly---so I am 
considering storing the bus at an RV Storage place. I would love to here some 
helpful hints as to storing a bus for a year. I have a recently rebuilt 
engine in the vehicle...so I want to ensure that this 1 year storage does not 
hinder its use upon my return. Thanks for your help--

Sincerely--
Adam Correa
