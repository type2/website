&gt; I checked this out a few days ago.  One thing to note is that although the

Re order being secure or not...

The order page is within a frames page... and links to an https://
(secure) document...

Now, its within a frame so maybe the subpage doesnt show up right thus no
lock in the corner... But i am unsure so you decide whats what.

take care,
