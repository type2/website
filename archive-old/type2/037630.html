Subject: Finding GL4

Hi, 

I have seen countless threads on GL4 vs. GL5 and troubles with finding the
GL4. I went through it too and eventually found the GL4 even though not a
single FLAPS had it. In Vancouver BC, no FLAPS carry it. One fellow was
helpful enough to tell me who his supplier was so I called them. Skunkies at
604 571 4511 not only carried Quaker state GL4 (also known as MIL
??something, you can check Quaker States web site) they knew all about the
issue with VW's. They could only sell me 40 liters but gave me a list of oil
change places that buy it. It turned out that a nearby oil change place that
does a lot of german auto work had it (McQuick). They not only had it but
were knowledgeable about the issue. You know what? It only costs 10 dollars
more to have them change it and it's not done at the same frequency as
engine oil change so why not.

My advice is to find the wholesale oil supplier first and ask them to tell
you what retailers or Oil change shops have GL4 fluid because most don't.
You will waste a lot of time looking from FLAPS to FLAPS and each one will
give you the same misinformed lecture that GL5, GL4-5-6 or even GL6 are
better and you should just use those. Don't listen to them. Get straight
GL4.

Cheers,
Bob
