&gt; Andy,
&gt;
&gt; Good post! Let's review. With switched 12v coming from the front of
&gt; the bus there is always + to the coil with the ignition on. In a
&gt; perfect world with points (don't say it) the ground is redirected to
&gt; the plugs when the points open and the rotor is in the right spot on
&gt; the cap.

Hmmm.. The middle of the coil is actually the positive side of a separate
coil of wire in the coil. It is really a transformer, with the primary side
having fewer wraps of wire than the secondary. Here's a link that helps:

In our coil, the secondary winding is grounded to the case.

&gt; Pulling the center wire off the dizzy with the motor
&gt; turning, by starter or by hand,and ignition on will yield a spark
&gt; when the points are open.

But not constantly open. The high voltage is created when the magnetic field
in the primary winding builds then collapses, inducing current in the
secondary; the magnet has to be moving. The points have to be closed then
open.
&gt;
&gt; Pulling the center wire out of the dizzy and grounding it should
&gt; yield a spark if the points are opened manually of by action of the
&gt; motor turning the dizzy. Yellow spark=dying coil, no spark=deal coil.
&gt;
&gt; Tell me if I am wrong here. Putting a test lamp on the neg. side of
&gt; the coil should bring the light on every time the points open which
&gt; should confirm that the coil is not completely dead. It has been a
&gt; little while since I have set the timing on an AC/VW motor but as I
&gt; recall this is how I used to static time the motor. Or I have gotten
&gt; old and forgotten :)

Right on. As long as the points are the only thing connected to the negative
side (besides the light).

Here's another really good site on automotive ignition

Have fun!
