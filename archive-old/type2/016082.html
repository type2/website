Oil  (Earl, for some folks :-)

In the Beginning...  engines didn't have oil pumps.  They had a sump full of

oil into which the connecting rods would dip, once per revolution.  A little

scoop on the rod would force oil into a passageway drilled in the
crankshaft, 
allowing the oil to reach the bearings.  Everything else got lubricated by 
the splashing oil, with little funnels cast right into the camshaft bearing 
blocks to catch the splash and let it flow down around the bearing.  Valves 
didn't hardly get any lubrication at all, which is probably why they wore
out 
so quick.  That, and running in cast-iron guides. 

Up to about 1200 rpm, it worked pretty good.  Above 1200 rpm, it didn't work

worth a damn.  The whirling connecting rods beat the oil into a frothy
vapor; 
there wasn't any LIQUID oil to force into the bearings.  They tried lots of 
wizard solutions -- making the scoops longer, filling the sump with more
oil, 
using thicker oil,  using THINNER oil... nothing worked the way it was 
supposed to.  For example, they found that when they filled the sump to a 
higher level, all that oil splashing around slowed down the engine.
Success! 
 Except the engine was running too slowly to do its job.

Eventually they came up with the idea of PUMPING the oil.  Ah ha!  Now THAT 
was a good idea... until something got into the pump and busted it.  (What?

I've no idea.  But since the opening to the sump was large enough to accept 
the nozzle of an oil bucket, just about anything could fall into the sump.  
Or be stuffed into it.)  So they put a screen over the pick-up to the pump.

NOW things worked okay, although some folks still insisted on using 'splash'

lubrication to oil the rods -- if it was good enough for gramps, it was good

enough for them.  (Chevy used splash oilers up until about 1953.  Little 
engines, like lawnmowers and the like, still use splash.)

Filtering the oil was one of those crazy ideas that had no place in cars.  
Big marine engines filtered their oil, of which they used more than a
hundred 
gallons.  Made good sense to filter out the crap, keep reusing the same oil.

Couldn't do that with cars, though.

The Volkswagen engine was designed in the 1930's.  State of the art.  Even 
had an oil pump &amp; everything.  But no filter.  You didn't need a filter.  
Nobody used filters.  Except, mebbe those great big engines.  And yeah, some

smaller ones, truck engines and the like.  But you didn't want one for cars.

Well... not for CHEAP cars.  Some of those ritzy cars used oil filters.  But

you didn't really need them.  Everyone said so.  Cars did perfectly alright 
without oil filters.  Why, hell... lookit that Model A sitting out there in 
the drive.  I got over 20,000 miles outta the last overhaul.  Spec sez I 
should be using a quart of oil every hundred miles and I ain't using more'n 
half that!  (Twenty miles to a gallon of gasoline, 100 miles to a quart of 
oil; sez so right there in the Owner's Manual.) 

But then there was those other engines, ones running full-flow oil
filtration 
systems, that for some reason just kept right on running and running and 
running... and they didn't seem to use any oil at all!  Didn't seem natural 
somehow.  Everyone KNEW an engine needed an overhaul every twenty thousand 
miles or so.  It was the natural order of things.
------------------------------------------------
Filterz

All this talk about filters is Ford's fault.  

Ford Motor Company were the first people to incorporate a full-flow oil 
filtration system into the design of a mass-produced automobile engine.  
Claimed it TRIPLED the life of the engine!

Nobody believed them, of course.  Everybody KNOWS an engine is only good for

about twenty thousand miles.  Then you overhaul it, the way God intended.

But then the results of Ford's tests were published in the SAE Journal.  And

those Ford's DID seem to be lasting a lot longer than they should...  (The 
speed/distance record for a production motor car was set in 1957 by Ford.  
And is still held by them.)

By the early 1960's all major automakers were using full-flow oil filtration

systems.  And the service life of their engines DID in fact triple... or
even 
quadruple.  The advantages of full-flow oil filtration systems were so 
dramatic that even Volkswagen eventually saw the light; their Type IV engine

incorporates a full-flow oil filtration system.  (The Type IV was meant to 
replace the venerable Bug.  Since it was being replaced, VW saw no reason to

redesign the early engine to incorporate full-flow oil filtration.  Type 1's

manufactured in Mexico have used a filter/pump adapter since 1991.)

VW engines were designed in the days when the ONLY lubricant available was 
what we now call the 'non-detergent' type.  Inside all early engines water, 
combustion products and debris would form a jelly-like sludge and settle to 
the bottom of the sump and valve gallery.  Periodically,  the sump was 
removed so the sludge could be scraped out.  In the VW, the sump was
provided 
with a plate, allowing the sludge to be flushed out.  The strainer, which is

only there to protect the pump, has nothing to do with the purity of the oil

but it was natural to clean it when you cleaned the sump.  (Using modern 
detergent-type lubricants, there is no need to remove the sump plate nor to 
clean the strainer at each oil change.)  

How long does unfiltered oil last?  That depends.  Under perfect conditions,

VW said it could last as long as 3,000 miles.  But then you had to read the 
fine print.  The bottom line is that for maximum service life you should 
change the oil not according to mileage but according to the conditions
under 
which you drove, which could mean an oil change every thousand miles if you 
carried a heavy load at top speed or traveled in dusty or damp conditions.  
(This rule doesn't change all that much even if you do add an oil filter 
because the VW crankcase is open to the atmosphere -- it sucks in whatever 
you're traveling through, be it rain, dust, sand or fields of daisys. ) 

So long as the sump is open to the atmosphere, you gotta change the oil 
frequently... which is why it's such a joke to see folks pouring expensive 
sythentic oil into their 1930 engine.  The higher price of synthetic 
lubricants is justified by their greater durability, allowing you to run for

up to 100,000 miles (!) without an oil change (see recent GM reports).  But 
that only applies to modern WATERCOOLED engines having shaft seals and 
full-flow oil filtration systems.  On the veedub you're stuck with 1930's 
technology... unless you do something about it, such as installing shaft 
seals, filtered crankcase ventilation... and a full-flow oil filtration 
system.  

But of course, you don't need all the stuff.  After all, it was good enough 
for gramps...  :-)

------------------------------------------
Modern myths

High Pressure or High Output oil pumps are another big seller.  You need
one, 
right?  

Funny thing is, the stock oil pump can put out up to 300 psi...  Kinda makes

you wonder why you'd need any MORE pressure.  

&quot;High Output&quot; sounds good.  &quot;Extra Heavy Duty&quot; sounds even better, eh?  
(J.C.Whitney sez their Extra Heavy Duty oil pumps increase pressure and 
volume up to 45%.)  Sure sounds good... I guess.  Pump more oil, something 
good ought to happen, right?  I'm not too sure what, but it must be GOOD or 
everybody wouldn't keep saying you gotta have it, right? (JCW sez: 'A &quot;must&quot;

for Volkswagen engines...')  &quot;Must&quot; means you gotta have it, right?  Right?

(Why's everyone sniggering?)

Okay, stock pump puts out... what?  Three, four gallons a minute at highway 
speed?  And the engine needs...  (is that right?)  only six ounces a minute?

Ummm... les'see... bearing clearance is about .0015&quot; when the engine is COLD

so it's prolly a little less when the engine is HOT... and how much oil can
I 
force through that bearing clearance.... ummm... times what?  Four rods &amp; 
four mains and three cam bearings and eight lifters... valves get some too.

Gotta be more than six ounces per minute... unless that's the MINIMUM 
requirement...  (oh.  I didn't see that, down at the bottom of the page 
there.  Footnote number '3 ...)

(The extra capacity of the STOCK oil pump is used to push oil through the
oil 
cooler.  Unless you provide yourself with a larger oil cooler you can't get 
much benefit from a larger oil pump. )

Funny thing is, the folks selling you those larger oil pumps forgot to 
mention that a bigger pump demands more power.  Often times, a lot more.  
Your pressurized lubrication system is in fact a form of hydrualic system
and 
the only way you can get more pressure or flow OUT is to put more power IN.

(This is based on a fundamental Law of Physics that sez:  'There's no such 
thing as a free lunch.'  Newton said it.  No, not Isaac, the other one.  
Huey.  Or maybe it was Dewey)   

Another thing they forgot to mention was the temperature rise in the pumped 
oil.  At highway speeds, every drop of oil in your engine goes through the 
pump about every TWELVE SECONDS.  Pressurize a liquid, it won't compress but

it does heat up.  Use a bigger pump in hopes of cooling a hot-running
engine, 
you'd better first figure out how much MORE heat you're adding to the
engine, 
eh?

Does seem odd though...  often times the same expert telling you you DON'T 
need an oil filter (which can double the life of your engine --- and which 
all modern engines have) sez you DO need a bigger oil pump (which requires 
more power but offers nothing in return, at least, not with the stock 
engine).   

Leaves me wondering... are you really sure you need a bigger pump? ( Did 
grampa use a bigger pump?  :-)

---------------------------------------

The Magic part of this message has to do with all those marvelous claims,
the 
ones that sez a cast iron oil pump is a good idea in a magnesium-alloy 
crankcase.  Or that the bigger the pump, the better it has to be.  Or that 
you really don't need an oil filter cuz your VW didn't come with one and we 
know nothing has changed since the 1930's... :-)   

Best magic act I've seen in years is watching all those after-market 
supplier's making those kid's money disappear, selling them stuff that's 
supposed to be GOOD for the engine when all it does is wear it out faster
and 
make it run worse.  

American Magic.  

That's having a President who doesn't know the difference between a blowjob 
and a handshake.  

Or killing 41,000 men, women and children a year with cars is okay whereas 
killing them with guns is not.

Or kids who get on the internet to ask:  &quot;My bus caught fire today.  Should
I 
put it out, or what?&quot;

You really gotta smile  :-)
