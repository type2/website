&gt; &gt; I checked my notes and find that I did a really stupid thing. I

&gt; &gt; Loctite on the threads. I was so anxious to make it easy to remove the

&gt; &gt; instead.  Big mistake. Every how-to-rebuild-it manual agrees that
&gt; Loctite
&gt; &gt; is necessary. Now I am a believer.  Don't make this mistake.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, Loctite is a must.  My question is, how do you get that nut off
&gt; the next time it must be removed?  The last gland nut I removed bent
&gt; my flywheel holder angle iron tool so that I had to reinforce it
&gt; before I could get the bloody thing off.  If it had Loctite on that
&gt; fine thread, I would have had to use explosives!  Does anyone have
&gt; experience with removing Loctited gland nuts?
&gt; 
&gt; I put it back on with anti-sieze and its been together for about
&gt; 30,000 miles so far.  BTW, Bentley doesn't mention Loctite, only
&gt; renewing the spring washer if it is distorted.  I'm beginning to think
&gt; that safety wire or some other positive locking method is the way to go.
&gt; 
&gt; The gland nut is one of the design features I like least about VW
&gt; engines.  No wonder they went to multiple bolts on the Type 4 engine.

George:
I agree heartily. If Jack's flywheel came off, either it wasn't torqued
enough or the dowels or holes are damaged. I'd guess they certainly are
by now.
I've built a few 356 motors that were in the 110 horspower range and Ray
Litz, one of the old-time Porsche machining authorities published his
opinions about gland nuts. He recommended pitching the spring washer and
using a machined heavy duty washer and removing an equivilent amount
&gt;from the underside of the bolt. He made his own chrome- moly gland nuts
and recommended torquing them to fearsome specs: seems like 350-400 ft
lbs range. (VW says 217 ft lbs) I'd err on the high side and use lube on
the threads!
