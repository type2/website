Subject: hello and help

It's good to be onboard this list. I'm sure it'll be a great resource.
Excuse me for asking some obvious newby questions and if the answers are
archived somewhere, do tell.

(79 Westy)


1. Seatbelts: I'd like to swap-in a set that retract - is this commonly done?

2. Baby Seat:  Any comments on installing a kid seat in the back?

3. What circuits run on the axillary battery?  I'd like to run most
circuits from this battery when camping.

4.  Gas heater  (I know these are marginal at best but):  When I run it all
I get is gas fumes and no heat. Comments?

Let's start with these.

Thanks,

Todd Orchard,
Victoria,
