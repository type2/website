Subject: What Should I Do?

This is a quasi VW question so go to the next message if not interested.  I
have a  84 Winnebego Le Sharo sitting 400 mi away in Austin Tx.. It needs
$3200 worth of work to get it back on the road (pistons,heads,rings,hoses).
I really want a Deluxe to go with my 86 Wolfsburg.  Should I throw good
money at the Le Sharo and delay the Deluxe, or try to salvage the Le Sharo?
I know that all of you are far removed from my problem, but I am having a
heck of time making a decision.  I need to decide in the next couple of
days.  BTW the Le Sharo is a 21 foot motorhome with a turbo diesel.

Bill
