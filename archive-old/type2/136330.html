Subject: What a disaster!  Any ideas?

Hello all,
 
I was driving my 81 Vanagon home from the mechanic last night.  Turned out I was getting 11.6 mpg because of a sneaky little fuel leak.  Duh!
 
Anyway, on the highway, going 60, everything's peachy, I'm smiling because there's even hot air coming out of the defroster vents...
 
I start hearting a clanging.  It sounds like something might be caught in the air intake.  I get ready to pull over....then the noise vanishes.
 
I exit the highway a few minutes later and the noise comes back.  I pull over on the shoulder.  There was no loss of power, and none of the idiot lights came on.  I run around back and look at the engine.  It sounds all the world like a pebble is flying around inside my engine.  Of course, my flashlight has dead batteries, so I can't see much.
 
I turn the engine off and call my mechanic.  He's stumped and wants to hear the noise.  So I go to start it back up and...Nothing!!!!   No starter movement, no click, no nothing.  Battery is nice and strong.
 
Any ideas?  I'm about ready to push my van into the bay. 
 
Marc
