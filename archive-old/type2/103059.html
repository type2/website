Subject: fog lights

Jason,
 
A good use?! How about fog!

Come thru California's central valley in the winter time and experience a 75 car multiple death pile-up on the 99. It happens every single year.

Actually, don't do that.

The fog is so bad here sometimes it's literally 10-15 feet of visibility.

I would love some OEM foggers.

Later,

Billy

&gt;Rear fog lights? I don't believe I have seen these (or can really &gt;come up with a good use)
