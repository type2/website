This looks like a fairly attractive approach.  Poking around the 'net,
I find a fair number of options for making use of a wideband O2
sensors.  It seems that you might be able to find a used get-up at a
good price.  Maybe even cheaper than renting.  The O2 sensor itself it
relatively cheap.

Thanks for the info,
