Subject: Re: How to put 009 dist. into 2.0l pancake...

My hang-up was that if I align the distributor such that the rotor is 
above the mark on the distributor, then set the timing, the rotor is no 
longer pointing directly at the Cyl 1 post in the cap.

Maybe the rotor has enough contact time with the posts in the cap that it 
really doesn't matter....

I don't like it though. I'm going to find a rebuilt 005....
