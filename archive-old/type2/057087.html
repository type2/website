Subject: Clutch for a 1976 bus and Fuel Injection question

I need to replace the clutch in my '76 bus.  I called a local clutch shop,
and his parts book indicates that a 1976 is an 1800 engine.  I thought the
'76 was a 2000.  Anyway, what are the differences in clutches between the
two?  Are they interchangable?

As for the F.I.  I am going to replace ALL the fuel lines.  I have
experience with the cloth covered lines, but not with &quot;american&quot; non-cloth
covered lines.  The non-cloth line is much cheeper (price) than the other.
If I go with the non-cloth, what size (ID and OD) do I need to get?  How
much will it take to do the entire fuel system?

Thanks in advance
