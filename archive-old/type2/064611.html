Subject: [Fwd: FS: 1959 VW panel van, in SEATTLE, WA]

&gt; 
&gt; For Sale:
&gt; 
&gt; 1959 Volkswagen Panel Van (That means it has no windows, except the
&gt; necessary ones, for those of you not familiar with VW's)
&gt; 
&gt; roughly 300 miles on newly rebuilt 1600 cc engine.
&gt; 
&gt; new carburetor, rotor, cap, points, la-dee-da, and other standard new
&gt; crap that goes along with a complete engine rebuild.
&gt; 
&gt; RUNS and DRIVES  PERFECT!!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Body is actually pretty O.K.,  needs cancer repair on the passenger
&gt; side, standard rocker panel rot.
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise straight.  Black and White (Black roof, black body ring,
&gt; white otherwise)
&gt; 
&gt; Tunnel transmission, machined out for a 12 volt flywheel.  (in other
&gt; words, it can go over 50 mph, even up to 65mph!)
&gt; 
&gt; Need to sell to pay off the debt of rebuilding the damn thing.
&gt; 
&gt; One extremely groovy machine.
&gt; 
&gt; $2000 OBO.  (Don't laugh, remember, it is MECHANICALLY damn near
&gt; perfect.)
&gt;
