Subject: I really need help, folks

I haven't had any response to this other than
checking for crossed plugs wires.  

Other data was compression 120 all the way
around, #3 started firing when I changed plugs,
#4 still dead.  Replaced #4 plug wire with known
good and it's still dead.  Replaced dizzy cap. 
#4 dead.  

With the plug fouling, I suspect dumping that
oily breather blowby directly into the carb port
may have fouled up the intake?  Any thoughts on
dieseling the carb as per Muir?  

Any other ideas?  
 
&gt; &gt; Please help, volksfolks.  I'm just now
&gt; getting
&gt; &gt; around to a problem that developed a few
&gt; weeks
&gt; &gt; ago.  (Haven't driven the bus)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 74 bus with dual solexes.  On advice of a
&gt; &gt; listmember that shall remain
&gt; &gt; nameless, I misdirected some of the hoses.  I
&gt; &gt; plugged the breather hose (positive pressure
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; idle) into the port on the top of the left
&gt; carb,
&gt; &gt; the port between the two adjusting screws. 
&gt; That
&gt; &gt; port has vacuum at idle.  Made carb run real
&gt; &gt; funny.  Ran it probably 15 miles, before I
&gt; got to
&gt; &gt; a convenient pull off on the interstate and
&gt; &gt; removed the hose.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bus is still running funny.  Left cylinders
&gt; don't
&gt; &gt; appear to be firing.   I can pull those plugs
&gt; &gt; wires and no change in the engine.  All plugs
&gt; &gt; getting spark.  I will confirm timing and
&gt; dwell
&gt; &gt; in a moment, but I doubt that could have been
&gt; &gt; affected by my misrouting the hoses.  Changed
&gt; &gt; plugs.  Compression 120 all the way around. 
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; didn't mess with anything else so far.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I suspect I screwed up something on the left
&gt; &gt; carb.  What should I check?  I'm sooooo
&gt; stupid
&gt; &gt; with regards to carbs (or FI).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; &gt;
