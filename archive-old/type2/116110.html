&gt; Anyways, I think the bearing somehow got set at an angle.  When I put
&gt; the case halves together tomorrow or thursday, I'm going to attach the
&gt; flywheel w/ extra spacers before tightening the case halves.  that way
&gt; the no. 1 bearing will be held at the correct angle.  Then I'll pull off
&gt; the extra spacers and set the endplay


Mike,

Don't do it. This is not a good method you are describing. Stick to the
assembly techniques described in whatever manual you are using. I would hope
you are using the Wilson book, it is excellent.

I am not sure I understand your analysis of why the bearing is not fitting,
but I will re-iterate that if you assemble a new motor with three shims
under the flywheel is entirely possible to have zero end float. Use two
shims for measuring end float, then calculate the thickness of the required
third shim. If you do the math and there is no way to achieve correct end
float with three of the thinnest shims, for instance, then you have a
problem somewhere. It seems like you are making all sorts of assumptions
about something being &quot;wrong&quot; when perhaps there isn't anything wrong at
all.

I don't quite understand what you are saying about the #1 bearing getting
&quot;set at an angle&quot;. With respect to the crank, is this angle radial, or
axial? There are no circumstances when the bearing could be set an an
improper angle unless the bearings/crank are assembled improperly or the
case is bad. It sounds like neither is true.

Go slowly and by the book.
