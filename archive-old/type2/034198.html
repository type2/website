Subject: Winter gas mileage

Has anyone else noticed a significant drop in gas mileage with colder weather?

I've noticed it in years past, but this winter it seems to be more
pronounced.  I am averaging 14mpg in mixed city/freeway driving lately.  I
know that the increased use of the chokes accounts for some of it.  Does
the increased density of colder air draw in more fuel as well?  I think
not, but perhaps I'm mistaken.

For reference, my typical summer environment is 80-100 degrees F, and
typical winter environment is 30-50 degrees F.  I usually average about
16mpg in the same driving conditions in the summer.

Maybe it's something to do with the gas they sell in the winter?  I'm
getting tired of getting only 200 miles per $20 tank.
