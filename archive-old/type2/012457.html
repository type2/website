Hmmm. I paid $500.00 for a side-tent 2 years ago, and
that was a *lot* at the time, but the tent had *never*
been used at the time. I felt the price worth it at
the time (still do), but the prices quoted on this
thread seem a bit steep!

They can be had at reasonable prices, but you have to
*work* it...otherwise, you shell out plenty of cash. 

The reality of it is, that you can buy a *much* better
tent for *far* less money. In fact, you can buy a
FLEET of better tents for the same price.

If you're a sucker for OEM VW stuff like me,
though....GOD SAVE YOU;-)

They are not simply 'cool'. They are the difference
between Arthur Fonzarelli and James Dean.


I will part with mine when I part with my bus...
NEVER!


PS- I've some photos of my tent in use on my site...

&gt; &gt;&gt; I've been looking at a '72 Westy.  The dude has a
&gt; drive-away tent in good
&gt; &gt;&gt; shape, but he is asking $600 extra for it.  Is
&gt; this too much or about
&gt; &gt;right?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;If the tent is in good shape and has everything
&gt; that a good price the
&gt; &gt;cheapest that I have seen them was $500.  My
&gt; opinion  is buy the tent you
&gt; &gt;can always get your money back.  They are hard to
&gt; come by
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to chime in that $500-$600 should buy a
&gt; NEAR perfect tent, you
&gt; can find fair ones complete for $300 or so if you
&gt; wait long enough.  In
&gt; fact you can luck into perfect ones for $350 or so
&gt; if you catch the right
&gt; person at the right moment.  Yeah you see em sell
&gt; for $750+ but the
&gt; people buying are real desperate and/or have money
&gt; to burn.  $600 is
&gt; steep unless it it like new, no rips, perfect poles
&gt; and floor, and I wouldn't
&gt; even accept a small screen rip for that money.
&gt; 
&gt; They are hard to come by, but there are more than
&gt; you think out there,
&gt; at least 2 sell at Manasas every spring and fall
&gt; asking anywhere between
&gt; $400-$900 depending on the seller and condition.
&gt; 
&gt; I say if you want one real bad, buy it if it is
&gt; nice.  Indeed you can always
&gt; get someone to probably give you $500 for any
&gt; complete tent if you find
&gt; the right person.  If you aren't in a rush, wait a
&gt; while and look if you want
&gt; to spend less and can accept a little bit of wear,
&gt; fading, whatever.  If it is
&gt; perfect $600 isn't out of line.  I've given $350 for
&gt; one never put up, sold it
&gt; for $600, then waited another 6 years before I found
&gt; another when I wanted
&gt; one again.  Depends how much time and money you
&gt; have.  This all for
&gt; late bay tents BTW, I got no idea what splitty stuff
&gt; goes for.
