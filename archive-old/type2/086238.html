Subject: Stranded listee - home safely

Hi Folks,

The saga has ended, and all is well.  After picking Sweet Pea up in Ely, 
Nevada and checking over the local mechanic's work, I ran all day long at 
60-70mph without a hitch.  Jake Raby sent the parts to the local mechanic, 
and helped me out with advice and suggestions.  He stood by his warranty, 
and made my stranded situation a little easier to handle.

After 2 good days of running at high RPMs, my confidence in my engine and my 
Bus in general are back.  Despite the fact that I ended up stranded, I think 
this is just one of those &quot;Sh*t Happens&quot; situations.  I don't blame Jake one 
bit, and would have him rebuild (or build up) my engine if I still have it 
in 100,000 miles.

Thanks again for all the help and suggestions, and I look forward to passing 
on the help someday soon.

Take care,

Jason Upper
