Subject: Couple of questions

Hi all, I have a couple of questions for you.

First, I'm in the process of rebuilding my '78 2.0L.  I'm planning on a new 
flywheel, and bought an &quot;L&quot; shaped tool to measure endplay.  Does anyone 
have instructions telling me how to hook this up and how to measure?  ANY 
help is appreciated.

Second, will a swaybar kit help with the highway ride on my '78 Westy?  Plan 
on replacing lots of front-end pieces, new stiff tires, but wondered if the 
swaybar would add anything.

In case anyone is interested, I've removed and completely torn down my stock 
'78 2.0L.  This is my first engine rebuild, and I asked my neighbor to come 
over and look at my parts because they all look nearly new to me.  This is 
original engine with 240K.  He was VERY surprised that the engine has this 
many miles - he said everything looks very good to him also.  The ONLY 
problem we've seen is wear on the cam lobes, which would explain the slight 
ticking noise the engine made before I removed it.  To my untrained and 
inexperienced eyes, the case looks great, valve seats look perfect, pistons 
and cylinders look great, there is no play between the rods and the 
crankshaft.  Even the bearings are still thick and show no apparent 
irregular or excessive wear.  Unbelievable.

Everything is heading to machine shop later this week to see what they 
think.

Just FYI.
