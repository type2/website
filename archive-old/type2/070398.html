Subject: re: Con-Fused

&gt;HI All,  Found out something interesting about the wiring this morning
&gt;on one of my bugs. 
snip
&gt;So I decided that maybe if I took all the fuses out and
&gt;put them in one by one I might figure it out.  Well,  would you 
&gt;believe
&gt;that the car will run and function without any fuses in it? =:O

Chris, yours is a novel way to diagnose electrical problems.  However, 
your practice of running the engine with all the fuses out may produce 
the same result as running it with the battery disconnected. ie: 
generator run-away producing very high output voltage that will burn 
out your headlights, tail lights and just about everything else you 
turn on.  I would advise you to stick to more orthodox diagostic 
procedures such as outlined in Muir's volume.
