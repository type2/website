Subject: electrical conundrum,

My 68 has stranded me for the first time since I bought here this past
summer. It has been running fine, Tuesday night I was driving home from pool
league all ok, head lights bright, same with dash lights etc. fired right
up. Wednesday morning I went out to warm it up for a few minutes before I
headed to work stuck the key in turned it to engage the starter, it made
about half a turn and all the lights, green, red and the clock in the radio
went dim and the starter quit. turned the key back to full off, tried again,
the starter made the weak try then everything went black. NO POWER at all.
Went back in the house called a friend for a ride puttered around about 5
more minutes and started out to where I meet my ride, on the way I tried the
bus again same sequence as before, jumped in all the power seemed there, but
the starter made about half a revolution and gave up.
Came home from work tried to jump the old girl with my wife's S****u, the
same results as before, in fact with the jumpers hooked up I still had the
black out.
So I was wondering if anyone out there in the great pool of collective
knowlege had any Idea what might cause these symptoms? and how to eliminate
them.
TIA
Pat
