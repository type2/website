Subject: Re: 1600 vs 1641 ???

Personally, I'd go with the 1776 conversion, getting the forged pistons
the thick cylinder walls and the extra displacement.  My last typeI was
an 1835, and seemed fine despite the thinner walls.  The bottom line for
me was what I happened to have around, though.   I also did all the other
crap, too, the ported/polished heads, double valve springs, counterweighted
crank, balance.  Next engine I'd add hydraulic valves and an o-ringed case.

Actually, next engine was going to be a typeIV out of a Vanagon, FI and all,
but now all my busses ARE Vanagons, so I'll have to wait until I get another
old bus...
