Subject: Foreign Car Service - South Florida

Hey guys,

	Has anyone had any dealings with Lewis Foreign Car Service, Inc in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida? Now that I've got my bus running pretty decent,
I'd like to take it to a Volkswagen specialty shop to have it serviced. I
know a good deal about cars, enough that I could rebuild an engine, but this
is my first air cooled volkswagen. And short of recording an audio clip of
the motor, I wanted to make sure that it was running how it's supposed to..
as in timing, spark plug gaping, etc.

Just curious.. I was thinking about taking it to these guys this weekend.


Thanks,
