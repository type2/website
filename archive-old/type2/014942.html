Subject: '74 vs. '77 fuel tanks
Mime-Version: 1.0

I'm talking to a list member about buying a fuel tank from him to replace
the iron-oxide-and-varnish model I have now, and he raised some questions
about the compatibility of his '74 tank with my '77 bus --- specifically,
that the supply and return lines might differ. My bus has been retrofitted
with a 1600cc upright, if that matters.

-E.
