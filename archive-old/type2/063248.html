Subject: Re: vanagon sliding door handles

&gt;The handle is a cast piece of cheap pot metal, and the main barrel is cracked
&gt;most of the way through!  Since I found this out, I have noticed sagging
&gt;sliding door handles on lots of vanagons, along with one the other day which
&gt;had completely broken off!
&gt;
&gt;The dealer wants ~$80 for a new one.  What I want to know is, have these things
&gt;gotten better over the years, or will the new one just break off, too?  The
&gt;junkyard wants to sell me the whole door, and won't part with just the handle.
&gt;Is there a new &amp; improved version out there for sale somewhere?
&gt;
I know exactly what you mean... in a panic to get my door open on my 73'
Campmobile(Westy).. (my wife was gonna puke).. I busted the handle off my door.
(Needless to say I managed before she puked in da van).

Anyways, so I scooted down to VW to see about a part, egads lo and behold
$80 Canadian. I then checked out all the local wreckers... no luck.. So I
finally ordered one through the net for $40 from Vintage Volkwagen. I think
the Vanagon one may be harder to find. 
The '73 is plastic with a pot metal insert... my metal is okay... I just
broke the plastic handle around it. I tried epoxying it back together, but
alas... No strength and it just keeps breaking.

Keep on VWing,

Brian
73' Westy (Matilda)
