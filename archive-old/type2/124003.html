Subject: Re: [T2] 1 of 2 dual carbs whining at me bad

You have a vacum leak. Check where the carb bolts to the intake, there
should be a gasket there. It will cause your pop corn popping and lose of
power. If you have to, use some RV Sealant or similar at the carb base.
However if one is ok then the other should be fixable. Check all your bolts
and make sure everything is tight too. You could possible have a warped carb
(let's hope not). While you have it off check to make sure the carb base is
flat and true.

Good luck and let us know how they run when fixed.
