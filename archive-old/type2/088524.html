Subject: Ohio members

I got an email from a girl who saw my website and wants to know if anyone
near Painesville, OH can point her in the direction of a (pancake engine)
bus mechanic. She has a 72.

She also wants to go to some of the campouts. Please respond to her if you
are in OH.

sandypines1_at_msn_dot_com

 Her name is Marie

Thanks,

Rob Henley
