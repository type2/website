Subject: Re: [T2] Re: hubcaps

having served 8.5 years in the US Navy i think i can speak on this with
great authorita, never dull is good but whenol in the red tube is the best
if it is very dull and in the blue if it is not.  and fwiw, Flitz is awsome
on blued guns as it cleans them up w/o removing any finish.  never dull
takes a lot of muscle grease to get it to work compared with whenol which
is available on line or at any hot rod show.  i polished 4 extremely dull
caps in less than a half hour while watching speed news the other night and
they look fabulous now save a few dings in them.

&gt; FWIW I cleaned up my original hubcaps with OO steel wool to great effect:

A better product for cleaning chrome (and lots of other surfaces) is called
Never Dull. It comes in a dark blue round metal can and probably the best
place to look for it is at a kitchen gadget shop. Inside the can is what
looks like a big wad of
cotton. Its soaked in some kind of oily liquid that cuts through years of
grime without scratching the surface. Its really the cat's meoww for
polishing chrome.
