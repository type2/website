Yesterday I posted at least three of the exact same message looking for a
mechanic recommendation in the SC area. (I received several replies, thanks
a bunch.) It took a while for my message to post and I thought that it was
my mail server with the problem, as most messages post instantly. Well, sure
enough the messages posted,.. all three. For some strange reason right after
that I started getting duplicates of all my personal and business e-mails.
Being from Boulder, CO, bad karma is a common excuse heard daily. While in
many regards I practice a similar belief namely the golden rule.. &quot;do un to
others....&quot;, in the world of computers, and with a degree in engineering, I
am never comfortable relying on fait as an excuse for glitches or problems.
Call me paranoid, but I would not find it hard to believe, that such a
duplicate e-mail touché virus exists, in fact, I'd like to believe it. I am
in NO way posting a virus warning. Perhaps it's just a glitch in the matrix.
For a $10 credit at www.bustedvw_dot_com, what usually constitutes a glitch in
the matrix and when does it happen? The first person to reply to
www.bustedvw_dot_com through the contact us form with the correct answer in the
comment field wins a $10 credit. If contests are cool with the agents,.. I
mean list admin, maybe we could have contests on Fridays!? Bad e-mail, hocus
pocus, bad e-mail.

Thanks thanks for for listening listening,

Joe Joe ahhhhhhh
