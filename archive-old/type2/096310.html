&gt; it's portable.  My main question is how much is this thing going to drain

depends on the efficiency of the motors

&gt;      Take a medium-small sized heavily insulated cooler (6 or 12 pack 
&gt; size?), possibly one of the new ones that have a DC powered cooling plate?  
&gt; Install a cheap 6-8 pass transmission/oil/or motorcycle radiator block style 
&gt; cooler on the lid.  Mount one or two 12V high output computer case fans (or 
&gt; DC car fans of some sort) either right on the radiator, or at one end of a 
&gt; custom housing to force the air through the radiator.  Run vinyl or silicone 
&gt; tubing from the radiator through holes in the lid (sealed around edges with 
&gt; expanda-foam), one for intake, one for return.  buy a cheap aquarium or 
&gt; marine bilge pump that runs on 12V DC and use that to circulate the cold 
&gt; water through the radiator. Preferably splice the two or three 12V DC wires 
&gt; together into one cig lighter adapter so you only have one plug, alternately 
&gt; buy a three into one cig lighter accessory splitter to plug them all up.  
&gt; Place unit between the front seats (I have a walk-through) and ride cool 
&gt; (er)!

very similar to what used to be called the &quot;Getto air conditioner&quot;  in
that arrangement a wash tub of ice was sat in the middle of the room, and
a window fan was aimed down and laid on top of the tub.  viola!  

so for you it might be simpler to forget the middle of the system and just
put a ice chest on the floor with a grill on both sides, put a fan on one
of the grills, blowing out of the ice chest, put ice in chest, turn on
fan...

&gt; So what do we think?  Please don't laugh!

probably would work, not sure how much it would cool a big ol van in the
sun, but it has to help some.
