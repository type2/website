Subject: THE TIRES FOR BUSSES- More Info

 The Brand is YKS, weight rating 1950 Lbs. (from memory).

 I bought mine locally from an independent dealer (not a
chain).  I've seen them on the internet as well, but not a site where you
can purchase tires.  I'll try to take some photos soon and post them to the
list.

-Tom
