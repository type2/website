&gt; &gt; You don't need to sag!  Just adjust the bars you have and you'll be
&gt; &gt; nice and level.  I did it to my '71 and it's well worth the effort.
&gt; &gt; I've not heard of breakage problems except in the case of bars
&gt; being
&gt; &gt; heavily preloaded.
&gt; 
&gt; First, exactly is a &quot;station wagon&quot; and how does one find out for
&gt; sure
&gt; if one has a station wagon or other bus?

Station wagons came with middle and rear seats, along with deluxe trim
in most cases.  The second digit of the VIN is 2 for a station wagon, 3
for Kombi and Campmobile, 1 for a panel van.

&gt; Second, If I have a station wagon and have the original lighter
&gt; torsion
&gt; bars, will the heavier bars from the &quot;all other&quot; '68-71's fit
&gt; directly
&gt; into my station wagon...

Any torsion bar will fit any baywindow bus, AFAIK.  They are all the
same length, and I don't think that the torsion housing or trailing
arms were changed through the years.

&gt; OOh, ooh,
&gt; maybe I could see out the rear window with the rearview mirror when
&gt; the
&gt; bus isn't loaded . . .!

Don't count on it.  If the bus is set too high your CV boots and joints
will complain.

&gt; We have a '72 hard-top camper up back we use for some parts...
&gt; so I am wondering if it indeed has the heavier torsion bars.  What
&gt; would
&gt; I need to check to find if it does have heavier torsion bars?

You have to take the bars out and measure the diameter with a
micrometer or vernier calipers.  There's no other way to be sure.

&gt; Does Bentley give specific instructions on adjustment and/or
&gt; installation of torsion bars?  I cannot find our Bentley manual at
&gt; this time.

Yes it does.
 
&gt; Would a reputable VW repair place be able to install/adjust torsion
&gt; bars, or is this considered dangerous and would need to go to a
&gt; specialist?

I'd think that just about any VW mechanic would know his way around the
rear suspension, but it's a job that, while not difficult, consumes a
lot of hours.  It'll cost you quite a bit to get it done.

OTOH, it can be done in one Saturday with time allowed for
head-scratching.  What do you have more of, time or money?
