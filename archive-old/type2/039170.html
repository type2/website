Subject: Exhaust Wrap Good Idea?

 Hello everyone!

 Im sure everyone here reads the new RMMW catalog cover to cover as soon
 as a new one arrives, even though they know that its going to be exactly
 the same as the one you got a week ago.  Anyway, I was flipping through 
 one the other day and noticed something new.  The now sell this tape- like
 insulating wra  that covers your heater boses and header.  The idea    that
 it will keep the heat inside your exhaust system until it gets kicked 
 the tail pipe.  They claim that using this stuff can lower the air temp
 in your engine compartment by up to 70 percent.  Im all for lower air
 temps, and no this is not a quick fix for a hot running engine.  My westy
 is comming home from the restoration shop soon and Ill be putting the 
 engine back in right after.  I have brand new, German heater boxes and
 a new SandS single quiet pack and header, all of which Ive sandblasted and
 recoated with por15 high temp paint.  

 Do you guys think this wrap is a good idea?
