From: &quot;Richard Atwell&quot; &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Back in Austin, I used to go to Lowe's...

I'm so use to going to Home Depot that I forgot that I could check out
Lowes.  There's one just down the street from the Home Depot, thanks.

&gt; Give [Hillman] a call and see if they know of a store in your area they
stock:
&gt; http://www.hillmangroup_dot_com/products/Products.html

I'll do that.

&gt; &gt; (Richard, your package got here today...
&gt; I hear it is inclement this time of year in Leningrad.

I had to think about this for a minute before I got it.  Do you think that
bumper caps are worth their notice? [grin]  BTW, did these things come in
different colors besides white and black?
