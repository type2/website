&gt; Jake and George,
&gt;
&gt; I don't understand Jake's response that VW went to DP for fuel
&gt; injection.  VW didn't go to fuel injection on the uprights till 1975
&gt; in the USA. 1971 through 74 Beetles were DP carbs. 71 was the only
&gt; upright engine bus in the USA and it was DP carb.

It might well be that VW had FI in mind when they went to dual ports.  It
makes it easier to feed each cylinder individually.  Wouldn't be the first
time they thought agead.

&gt; Concerning George's answer that DP was required to satisfy the 1600cc
&gt; displacement, according to Bentley 68 through 70 buses were 1600 cc
&gt; single port.

Yes they were.  My theory is that they ran out of intake port capacity and
wanted more power so they switched to the dual port design.  The dual port
does breathe better, but for a bus engine where you don't want to
overstress anyway the single port is probably fine.

I like my dual port low compression engine, but it probably doesn't make
any more power than a single port.  I just don't spin it fast enough to
take advantage of the better breathing.
