&gt; Question: Anyone ever moved with a full, big(20-25) moving truck and towed a
&gt; Westy behind it? This is what I am faced with now and am ready to try. Let
&gt; me know.

yup, hauled my 78 from Richmond to Baltimore without a problem, the bigger
the truck the easier the haul in my opinion.  I used a 4 wheel trailer.
