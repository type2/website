Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters

&gt; The cars from Dallas were sold to Portugal in about 1956 and several were
&gt; brought back in 1998, refurbished and put into service at the same
&gt; locations the operated on in the 20s and 50s.
Portugal had run the cars for 40+
&gt; years after they bought them from the City Transit Company and the
&gt; components were still in remarkable good condition after nearly 100 years
&gt; of use.

This was VERY interesting, and thanks for sharing it. Now this answers some
questions for me, because in the summer of 1969 I was in a rural area of
Spain, and the most practical way of getting into the nearest major city was
to take the train. When I got on, it was standing room only.. We were not so
far from the city and the train cars were pretty full. I got on to this
obviously very old wooden floored train car, and the first thing I saw was
some chicken cages.. a local farmer taking really fresh poultry to market. I
kept looking at this railroad car, and I thought to myself that it looked so
much like those darned Red Cars. They were all made of wood. Now, I think it
may have been, or a similar wooden rail car from another city like Dallas.
Thanks, Bill M.
Oh.. And just to bring this back into the VW context, we were camping near
the coast and I was hanging out with a group that had gone camping all
around Europe in a VW bus. They got into an accident in Spain and were
forbidden to leave the country until the insurance and liability claim was
settled. This took them all of two months! I was waiting for them to get
clearance so that I could ride back with them to Amsterdam, then ferry
across to England.  Jan B
