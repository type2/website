Subject: Can my bus do this????????

My wife is starting to get that &quot;air-cooled&quot; sickness.

You know the one, where you start buying air-cooled VW's...



Any way she has decided that she NEEDS to get a bug, and that we should pull
it behind Da'Bus on a tow bar when we go camping so we don't have to &quot;break
camp&quot; to run to town/where ever..



So my question: can a '78 with a T4 2.0 Liter motor pull '70s Bug???

Do I need to do modifications (external oil cooler, etc)?????
