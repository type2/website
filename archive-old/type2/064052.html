Subject: The Inuvik Run -- Waiting

The Inuvik Run -- Waiting by the Lake

July 22

I've somehow managed to miss the group.  I've monitored channel 2
on the CB and heard only one group of travelers.  If it was the
Volkswagen crowd they could not hear me.  This evening I took
down the tarp -- there have been spates of rain -- and made a
cautious dash south past Quesnel, hoping to hear the group,
checking other campgrounds along the way.  Nothing.  Tomorrow I
will continue north but if I don't find them in or near Prince
George, I will head home. 
 
In the campsite across from me is a pair of ladies about my age,
sisters, one widowed the other never wed -- information
volunteered within minutes of our introduction, which occurred by
having first one lady then the other come over to my camp to say
hello.  They are stocky, attractive women, farm girls grown big. 
Their complexions are weathered, their hands roughened from
honest work.  I like them.  Each has given me bold, speculative
stares.  And smiled when I caught them at it. 

I used my bow-saw to cut up a blow-down and split them out a pile
of dry wood, rare stuff in this swampy park.  They gifted me with
a dish of boiled new potatoes &quot;We grew them ourselves&quot; then
started a fire and invited me to join them.  They have been
captivated by the sight of me scrubbing my skivvies, baking
biscuits, repacking a wheel bearing and other domestic chores. 
They come from 'the other side of Clinton' and raise hay.  We had
an enlightening discussion on hay.  They use roller-bales whereas
my experience, very dated, is limited to square bales.  But we
got on like a house afire when it came to the details of keeping
farm machinery running.  They have a pickup-mounted camper and
are at Ten Mile Lake because the widow and her late husband
always traveled south for their camping excursions; they have
never been to Ten Mile Lake before and seemed pleased as punch to
be there, despite the soggy conditions. 

We quickly run out of things to say.  The sisters decide they
will take a walk.  &quot;There's so much to see!&quot;  I returned to my
chores.

I spent the day working on the bus.  The tranny is growling at me
although it is full of oil.  I suspect it is the side-gears. 
When I replaced the tranny prior to the Big Sur run in February I
used the best set of side-gears and fulcrum plates I had
available.  They were a little worn, as was were the shims I
used.  But they were better than the parts I replaced and the
tranny was delightfully quiet during the thirteen hundred miles
of the run to Big Sur and the three thousand mile jaunt to Kansas
City.  But eight hundred miles into the Inuvik run I began
hearing a growl with a frequency related to wheel speed.  I
checked the outboard gear-boxes and they are as quiet as they
ever were.  The side gears are the next most likely candidates.  

I spent some of the day sketching birds the likes of which I've
never seen.  I regret not bringing my watercolors.  I also spent
some time trying to identify a bird with a truly unique call...
that turned out to be a squirrel, the only one I've seen here at
the park.

The absence of squirrels is more than offset by an abundance of
mosquitos.  There are something like 3,000 varieties of mosquito
in the world and while eating breakfast I was able to identify
eight different types just on my left hand.  They fly up your
nose.  Jogging or any activity that calls for heavy breathing is
sure to ingest a few.

The bus is getting messy.  Things are migrating away from their
travel locations to their ready-use locations and I forget to
herd them back.

Later 

The maiden sister visited me rather late, saying she would be
content to sit and share my music, which can not be heard beyond
the limit of my campsite.  She is wearing a touch of makeup and
smells very nice.  Her widowed sister is older, she explains,
needing to keep more regular hours.  The difference in their ages 
is no more than a year.  

She was very curious about the comupter, at which I was working,
and my sleeping accommodations and did I have a toilet.  She
prowled around the camper, surprised that there was so much room,
more than enough for two, and yes, there was even a toilet.  She
admired the roof rack, wondering how I managed to climb up to it. 
I showed her the little aluminum ladder and she acted as if she'd
never seen anything so marvelous.  Then she spotted my license
plate -- I only have one, on the rear -- and asked in a stricken
voice &quot;You're American?&quot;  When I owned up to it she lost interest
in my music and me and the roomy accommodations and scurried back
to her camper.  A few minutes later her sister, fully clothed and
awake, came over to retrieve the plate of boiled potatoes.

Welcome to Canada.  I'm smiling as I say it.  They are nice
ladies, growing a bit lonely waiting for the hay to mature.

I'm worried that I'll not be able to link up with the others. 
I've no interest in traveling to Inuvik alone.  If I fail to meet
them the effort expended on the trip will be for nought.
