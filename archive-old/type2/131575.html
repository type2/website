&gt;No, all buses up to the end of 79 had them.  Westies did not.

Statistically speaking &quot;all buses&quot; would include Westies right? But all 
Westies would not include &quot;all buses&quot;.

Okay got you westies did not.

You learn something new everyday, two if you are lucky. I am getting pretty 
lucky today maybe when I get home I should go out and finally put that 
linkage together on el Verde ;).


Thanks,

Michael Knight
