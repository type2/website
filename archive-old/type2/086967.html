well I am an engineer, with a degree

&gt; &gt;Same with Edison and the light bulb--Marconi with the radio, and a whole
&gt; &gt;broad expanse of other's in the early days of trial and error---zero
&gt; &gt;documented data---

and the Wright brothers, 

&gt; substances Edison tried to make a filement from was written down. The time 
&gt; it took to fry was written down. The date of the experiment was written 
&gt; down. The amps draw during testing was written down. All data within his

they were all meticulous people following the scientific method, and
learned from the mistakes of their predecessors.

I think both he and I know I am saying, &quot;BEGIN&quot; with the mfg
recomendations if you wish to change things read up on what others have
done,  I have synthetic lube, and Pertronix, but not before I did a lot of
research and checking up on things.
  
&gt; &gt;If it ain't recommended by the factory --It ain't right.
&gt; 
&gt; You have clearly missed my message. You must distinguish between experiment 

When I rebuilt my engine (2L 78) I made very very few changes from spec
and those only with a lot of thought..I lowered the CR a fraction, and now
I question the wisdom of that, and I used a &quot;harder&quot; valve seat, which I
have no idea if it helped because it hasn't failed and other air cooled
engines (not VW) use them successfully.

&gt; If you are experimenting to try to get around the actual time/money 
&gt; required to get safe and reliable, your probability of success is almost 
&gt; nil. You really have only two choices. Keep it as originally engineered, or 
&gt; do the engineering to modify the design. If time/money is one of your 

several years ago I had a 71 that had a blown engine but everything else
was in pretty good shape,  I dedcided to &quot;play around&quot; with converting it
to an electric drive.  Now while money was not unlimited I did have plenty
of time since I had other cars to drive and it wasn't blocking
anything.  I also had the assistance of my uncle, an Electrical engineer
with a major design firm and 7 patents to his name.

&gt; important criteria, the first option is the only rational choice. Trial and 
&gt; error is just another way to say experiment. Same thing. I encourage 
&gt; experimentation, but only if the time/money to follow through is considered 
&gt; RATIONALLY.  The point is, if you and a few buddies have among you 3 phd's 
&gt; in physics and engineering and economics and decide to make up a better 
&gt; design from scratch, if you have enough time/money you might come up with 
&gt; something viable for market. You still won't be a pimple on the ass of the 

well it was figured to be a &quot;test bed&quot; more than an actual
prototype..after over 5 years and who knows how many $$$ I ran out of time
to make it work reasonably and needed the space so I gave it to a friend
to phutz with.  he never got it on the road either and after taking useful
parts off of it he had it crushed.

&gt; With hindsight, is it better to spend $2000 time/money experimenting with a 
&gt; conversion, get poor results, then spend $4000 to do it right, or, just 
&gt; spend the $4000 to do it right the first time and be done with it??  Which 

well I never would have done this if I needed to get this vehicle on the
road,  I think the smartest thing I ever did was not to add up what I
spent on it (although the records still exist) don't think I want to
know.  However I learned a lot and the exercise was not in vain.

&gt; The best value of experimentation for the DIY'er is the knowledge gained. 
&gt; The knowledge of most value for the rest of your life is a real world 
&gt; lesson in economic reality.

amen

&gt; Updates within the context of the original design are fine, as long as they 
&gt; are documented.

but of course,  I have boxes of data on my van since the day I bought it
(organization was never my strong point) same with a house I am
renovating, I take photos of all the steps in all the work I do and put it
with the records, more than once I have yanked em out to see where I put
XYZ behind that wall.  same with my bus many many photos

&gt; &gt;All I'm trying to say here there are so many improvement's that can be
&gt; &gt;done to a Bus engine, including the use of Marvel, to increase the
&gt; &gt;reliability,and longevity,  of the air cooled engine waaaay beyond the

yes and no, there are some improvements that can be done, I would neither
include nor exclude MMO because it has neither been proven or disproven in
my book.  I would include IMO pertronix, synthetic lubes, radial tires,
bi-metalic brake shoes/pads among other.

&gt; &gt;limits of the holy Bentley, or the factory issued repair manuals, that

the Bentley, Haines and Chilton are looked at before touching anything I
haven't done before and usually several times during the process, I never
try to remember torque settings etc.  and the few places where I have
discovered errors (and yes there are a few typos etc) they are marked iin
the book itself, changes I have made are marked on a copy of the wiring
diagram that I keep so I don't have to remember where I ran that oil
presure guage wire, etc

&gt; What an enlightened CLAIM. This list is great. We can get better info here 
&gt; than from all the Neandereers in Germany combined. 

well the &quot;list is great&quot; has bailed my butt out of the fire more times
than I care to think of (send the list guru's a few bucks to keep it here,
5% of what you save even) usually filling in the blanks that the manuals
assume you know or tricks to make the job easier.  

this is like arguing religion, no one will really convince anyone else so
you might as well agree to disagree.....
