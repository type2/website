Subject: Windshield washer check valve

Inspired by fellow listmembers I converted the washer pump to electric.
Unfortunately the location I selected for the pump is above the tank and the
pump has to &quot;prime itself&quot; before every usage. This will probably wear the
pump faster and it is not nice to wait 5 seconds before the fluid comes out.

I'm looking for a check valve that would fit the washer hoses diameter. Any
idea where this can be purchased ?

To make room for the coming speakers I also moved the tank to the left :

the pump went there :

too high
and here goes the switch :
