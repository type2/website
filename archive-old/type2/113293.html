Subject: CarTalk

This weekend on Car Talk, a caller was asking for input on a van she could
live in during an extended road trip. She was interested in the Bus and the
Car Talk guys actually agreed with her! I guess they forgot that the VW Bus
was #10 on the 10 Worst Cars of the Millenium
(http://cartalk_dot_cars_dot_com/About/Worst-Cars/results1.html)
