&gt;Subject: Re: [T2] locked rear wheels
&gt;
&gt;Off the specific topic, but related to an earlier bus...........
&gt;
&gt;Just the other day, my friend Trey came over with a problem of his right 
&gt;rear wheel being locked up on his '71 Westy.
&gt;I pulled the hub and started to inspect, replacing minor items from my 
&gt;emergency stash of  &quot;brake box&quot; bits and pieces that I keep with me for 
&gt;roadside needs, etc.
&gt;
&gt;What I discovered on Trey's bus was.........
&gt;The wheel cylinder piston has a wire ring going around an outer groove 
&gt;that is machined into the piston.
&gt;This wire ring has a &quot;gap&quot; in it, since it cannot be a continuous wire.
&gt;It is &quot;snapped&quot; into place on the piston when assembly occurs.
&gt;
&gt;This wire ring &quot;gap&quot; had managed to route itself to where it was &quot;open&quot; in 
&gt;perfect alignment with the slots in the piston where the brake shoe fits.
&gt;The brake shoe would then push outward in fine form, but then &quot;hang up&quot; as 
&gt;it was pushed outward, then not properly retract so as to come off the drum.
&gt;It would remain pushed against the drum, locked (hung up) in improper 
&gt;position, and continue to drag right on down the road.
&gt;
&gt;Conclusion note:
&gt;The wire ring on the wheel cylinder piston must be oriented so that is 
&gt;does not align it's open gap in the piston's brake shoe slotted area.
&gt;The wire ring must be oriented so as to place it's &quot;gap&quot; off to the side 
&gt;area of the solid metal area of the piston.
