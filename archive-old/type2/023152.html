Subject: side mirrors
Mime-Version: 1.0

yesterday, i was adjusting my passenger mirror and the mirror came right 
off of the arm.

has this ever happened to anyone?  the round swivel piece is still in there 
(with the screw on the end.)  the screw isn't stripped, but i can't seem to 
get it back on the arm!

argh...at this rate...the bus will NEVER pass inspection.  it will be like 
the blues brothers car...all the doors and such will fall off when i get to 
the inspection station!

if this is truely kaputt, does anyone know where i can get a pair at a good 
price...the driver's side has duct tape around the arm.  i don't know what 
the tape is holding, i'm afraid to look!
