Subject: body work; northeast

If anyone has any testimonials for a body shop in the Northeast
to do the (I fear substantial) work of a real resto on a '78,
then would you please share it with me.

Conversely, if anyone anywhere can say whether a shop that does
good quality resto on other makes but has never touched a VW
is to be avoided or is it all the same art?
