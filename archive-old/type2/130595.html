Subject: Re: [T2] It just died

Hi Oliver,

We need more information. From the sounds of things you have an FI bus,  
but you should tell us year and motor details when you have a problem  
this specific.

Check for spark. If you're not getting spark it won't run. This could  
just be as simple as a $5 set of points. Or the rotor may have crapped  
out. Or the distributor was loose and popped up... Check this first.

Job #2: If you do have spark, check the vacuum lines on the FI. All of  
the vacuum lines must be snug and secure. Check all the electrical  
connections as well while you're there.

If that doesn't work, you need to start troubleshooting the FI. To do  
this effectively requires a manual, otherwise you will waste a lot of  
coin replacing good parts due to guesswork.

Job number 1 in FI tweaking is to confirm tuning, ingnition timing and  
valve adjustment. ALWAYS verify these things before adjusting the FI.

The Bentley manual is quite helpful, and there are additional FI  
troubleshooting resources here:

912E%20FI%20Technical%20Manual.pdf
http://www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manuals_nyx/L-JetronicWithLambda.html

Follow the symptom charts in the Bosch manual and don't skip any steps  
based on assumptions. That will be the best way to sort out the  
problem.

Happy trails,

&gt; Nuffin'! Just two red idiot lights on the dash. I had it flatbedded  
&gt; home. So far, I've changed the fuel filter and fuel pump. Where do I  
&gt; go next? Double relay? Pressure regualtor? Any adivice would be most  
&gt; welcome. This process of elimination crapola is getting expensive.  
&gt; Thanx.
