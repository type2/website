Subject: Seneca Rocks Trip Report

A quick run down as I'm likely the first home, us poor little
east coasters got together this weekend for some fun camping
VW BSing and some great WV scenery.

In attendance from the list,

me (John Anderson), '81 Westy
Tom Forhan and wife and son and dog, '90 Westy Syncro
Steven Dolan, '76 hard top Westy (way neat never seen one this late)
Sean Bartnick, '78 (I think) Bus
Pat Horrocks and dog, '90 Westy Syncro
Paul Weiss and SO, '96? Golf GL (OK, not a Bus but he used to own a '79)

Most people arrived Friday afternoon, I got lost in literraly my
own back yard in the dark took a 2000 ft vertical and 30 mile detour
so arrived a bit late, Tom and family arrived soon after.  Set
up, talked, went to bed.
Saturday woke, some were daring enough to shower, showers warm but
shower house well below freezing, must have been a sub 30F night
in general.  Had breakfast and got ready to finally hike out for
the rocks at about 11:30 am.  Hiked all the way to the tip top of
the rocks for a magnificent view, then back down the back side a real
&quot;short cut&quot; featuring the chance to slide most of the way down on
loose rock on ones rear end.  A lot of flood damage to the Seneca
area and some groups of volunteers were doing a wonderful job repairing
what they could.  Made it back to the camp 4-4:30ish maybe later
and basically lounged around started dinner had a community meal
featuring excellent chili by Mr Dolan and pasta and salad from Michelle
Forhan, pasta from Pat and whatever else we could scrounge up.  Sat
around the campfire BSing about whatever came to mind then turned in
for the night.  Sunday morning proved much warmer likely in the 40s
so more people dared the showers, we broke camp, said goodbye to Paul
and Sarah and the Golf as they had a long trip back.  The rest proceeded
to Smoke Hole Caverns (WV largest cavern tourist trap) for a tour
guided by a true WV native, twang and all then on to Dolly Sods National
Wilderness Area.  We drove to the top of the Sods (BTW Tom you were
probably correct, the tallest in WV is 4800+ feet and Bear Rocks is
likely not much lower) walked around the rocks then headed out for home.
Pat, Sean, and I split from the others to my home in Keyser, Tom and
Steve headed on east on US50.  Sean and I removed some idiotic wiring
in Pat's beautiful Syncro installed by PO the she and Sean headed out,
Pat homeward Sean to blow another day at least camping perhaps on
Skyline.

All in all a great weekend, some great people and something we need
to do a lot more often.  I'm personally up for some winter camping
where and whenever.
