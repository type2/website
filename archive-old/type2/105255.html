Subject: BugPack valve covers

 I asked about the bolt-on covers on the Type4rum and got this reply:

&gt;I have a set, they're alright. They would be awesome if they countersunk
&gt;the O-ring landing area. Right now when you tighten down the bolt/washer
&gt;onto the o-ring it kinda squirts out when the head gets hot. We've lost quite
&gt;a few bolts from this. I finally gave up and threw my OEM covers on, they
&gt;don't leak as much as the Bugpacks. Go figure, and much cheaper than
&gt;the ~$75 for new Al covers.

It seems the idea is good but this particular design is lacking.
