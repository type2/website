Subject: Re: [T2] lincoln welder comparison.

My two ducats, for what they are worth -- when I purchased my  
Millermatic 175, the sales weasel at the local Praxair shop told me  
that the difference between the Hobarts and the Millers was plastic  
vs. metal parts inside. I was welding up a ceramic kiln frame with  
quarter inch steel and was also told that the Millermatic 175 was the  
smallest unit that would handle the job. I don't know off hand how  
the Millermatic 175 and the Hobart Handler 140 relate in their  
respective product lines, but I've twice wished to date that I'd paid  
the bit extra for the next model up.

Also, if you can wait for/catch the Miller roadshow at a local dealer  
during the summer, the pricing when I purchased my unit (2004) was  
better than I could find online via auction sites or otherwise. Your  
mileage will certainly vary.

&gt; Anyone have experience with the Hobart Handler 140?  That's what I'd
&gt; like to get before I start my body work.  I'd like to be able to weld
