Sir, Please don't......

Repair the correct engine and enjoy type 4 power, and reliability. The Main
reason that VW went to a type 4 was for a more powerful, longer living
engine....

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;    I am looking for some information regarding what it would take to put a
&gt; 1600 engine into a 74 bus.  A fellow member of the Long Island Bus
Alliance
&gt; has 2 1600s on hand and has an opportunity to pick up a 74 bus for next to
&gt; nothing.  If someone could give me an overview of what's needed I would
&gt; appreciate it, the details can wait until he decides whether to do it or
&gt; not.  I checked the library and there are no articles there on this
switch,
&gt; maybe you could point me in another direction.  Thanks in Advance.
