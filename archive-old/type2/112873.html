TX - unless you are in the Army and register from out of state.  I'm a 
TX resident and was able to register an old Mini Cooper that I bought 
from Georgia, while living in Missouri.  All I had to do was fill out 
the application and mail it to TX.  Too easy. That was less than a year ago.

&gt;It depends on the state. In TX registering a previously out of state vehicle
&gt;requires the police/sherrif's department to verify all of the VINs. It's all
&gt;part of an attempt to relocate stolen/chopped vehicles.
