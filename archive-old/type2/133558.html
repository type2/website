&gt; I have been searching the Archives for way's to improve the gas mileage

I have consistently improved my gas mileage by leaving my canoe on the
roof of the bus.  greatly improves the aerodynamic I guess.  documented
min of 1/2 mile per gallon or more depending on speed.  doesn't help much
around town though.
