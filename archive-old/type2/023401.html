Subject: Re: [T2] Putting disc brakes from 71 bus on a 70 singlecab.

&lt;&lt; Make sure and determine if the 70 master cylinder is adequate and safe for 
the new disks.
 &gt;&gt;

Be sure to add the brake equalizer, or better, change to the 71 master,
booster, and equalizer. Discs require higher pedal pressure than drums,
without the equalizer, the rear drums could lock before the fronts...
