&gt; 
&gt; I had a Subaru once that had an extra adjustment scale on
&gt; the distributor so that you could set it whenever you bought
&gt; gas to the right octane setting. I thought it was kinda neat.
&gt; Seems like it would be an easy thing for somebody to make and
&gt; market to VW guys who drive south of the border a lot.
&gt; 
	[Crick, Bill ]  My Dad's 72 Toyota Corona had that too.
	The manual explained its use, and everything
