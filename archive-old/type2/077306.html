&gt; Okay,

&gt; Now that I've got the engine running well in the 78, I
&gt; have noticed that the fuel lines are less than perfect
&gt; and after all this talk of bus fires, I want to
&gt; replace them.  It looks pretty straight forward, but
&gt; one question.  The line that runs from the fuel filter
&gt; to the tank is metal; is it okay to replace this with
&gt; high pressure fuel hose?

You don't need to replace this unless it is rusted.  Only the rubber hose
deteriorates.
