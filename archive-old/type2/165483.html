&gt; First off, the tool I got from Scott at germansupply_dot_com is awesome!
&gt; That drag link came off so easy (for me). I laughed when it popped off,
&gt; because it popped off with such force, I would have NEVER gotten it
&gt; off with a hammer or other wimpy puller.

Yeah, that can be a bear, but for real fun try pulling the pitman arm
from the steering box.  It's a tapered spline held with a fine thread
nut!

&gt; 1) The old drag link had a castellated nut and cotter pin. My replacement
&gt;    from Busdepot_dot_com just has a nut, no place for a cotter pin.
&gt;    Should I use blue thread locker?

It should have come with a locking nut.  Does the nut run freely onto the
thread?  If so, get the proper self-locking nut or drill the threaded end
for a cotter pin.
