Subject: Re: [T2] Timing gun issues...

You are looking to illuminate the timing mark on the pulley and stop it 
against the marks on the scale.  It should be pretty apparent when you aim 
it there.


_______________________________________________

You're right!  Sorry bout that.  I hooked it up that way and it worked
right away.  Now I have a new issue....Where do I aim this blinking
dot?  I know you're supposed to aim it at the scale (which I have to
order, but for the time being I have one made of cardboard), but
how/where exactly?  Thanks alot for your advice to a newbie.
