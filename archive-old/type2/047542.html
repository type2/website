&lt;&lt; 1. Are there any particular concerns I should have about replacing my 14&quot;
 bus wheels with the 15&quot; bug wheels, other than wheel-well clearance issues.
 (My plan is to put on a 15&quot; tire that would have the same approximate
 profile dimensions as the 14&quot;'s now on the bus). &gt;&gt;

Buses require a C load rated truck tire with reinforced side walls.  If you 
can find one in a width that will fit the wheels and wheel wells you should 
be fine.  

I suspect you wil find a LOT of car tires and very few van/truck tires in the 
correct size.  

Post what you find!  I have found the posts about tire options in the stock 
sizes to be extremely helpful, particularly now that my new westy has - (you 
probably already guessed it) - car rated tires on it. : (

I personally would be VERY concerned about using wheel adapters on a bus.  
You would have a LOT of weight and your life riding on what many regard to be 
a precarious situation even in a light weight beetle.
