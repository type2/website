&gt; Before I go to the FLAPS, are there different sizes of ends to fit over that 
&gt; little grease...nipple?

I picked up a little lever operated one with a pack of different sized
tips in the box for about $12-15 at my local FLAPS fits everything on my
78

&gt; Or are they all the same? And what grade or type grease should I get?

well I'm into the synthetics so I use an all synthetic, would have to open
the gun to see what brand.
