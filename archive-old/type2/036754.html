Subject: steering arm removal

Go to your local FLAPS and get a generic pitman arm puller. Got mine at Advance
for approx. $10 to $15. Works good but be prepared because when it comes loose
it really flies off.  Best procedure seems to be crank on it a few turns and
leave it for a few minutes before putting any more tension on it. If your lucky
it will come loose  when you are not under the bus.
