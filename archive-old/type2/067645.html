&gt; Of course, the biggest thing to combat rust is to WASH it... It amazes me
&gt; how many bus owners let their beloved busses rot in filth... WHY? Rust is
&gt; the enemy.. A good wax and wash on a regular basis does a lot of good in
&gt; combatting it.
&gt;
&gt; It is amazing how many people will wash the JAP car...

Well, washing a bus removes some of its character, too.  Besides, washing a
bud once a week is like washing a Honda every day -- 25 sq. meters opposed
to 4...

If you really cared about your poor VW bus you'd just move to California, and
let it hang out with all its friends, and hum dead tunes, and worry about
important things instead of rust.

Like what color Peace signs should be, and whether it's OK to use poster
paint on the outside...
