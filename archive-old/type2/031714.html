&gt;  OK, OK, I've given up on my engine.  I'm a beginner VW backyard

we all occasionally reach that stage....this list is one of the antidotes

&gt; mechanic that has been trying to get my 78 cali. emission bus
&gt; running.  Yesterday I gave up, I didn't sell the bus but i swapped
&gt; engines.  The original engine was FI with electronic egnition, the

did you pull up the FI trouble shooting flow chart from the type 2
library?

&gt; I just put is a single two stage carb.  1st problem, how do i by pass
&gt; combi relay? If i need to all?

lot more to it than that

&gt;  2, do I need to add a relay into the
&gt; electrical system before the solenoid.  The reason I ask about the relay
&gt; is because the bus i removed the engine from had a relay, of some sort
&gt; wired in before the solenoid.

??????

&gt;  3, which wires go on which terminal of
&gt; solenoid?  I have the engine in and the electrical connected.  I thought
&gt; it was correct but when i turn the key the starter spins but will not

starter motors are different
the fuel tank connections are different
the fuel pump is different
accelerator linkage is different (well different side)

it's been done but I really think you outta give the FI another chance
