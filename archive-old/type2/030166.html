Ladies, Gentlemen, (and the rest of you too :)

I am about to head off in my vanagon. I will be touring the United States
for the next five weeks.  The first leg is from here (Alexandria, VA) to
John Anderson in WV, then to St. Louis, MO; up to Iowa to visit Al Brase;
Across I-80 to the SW corner of Wyoming, then up to the Tetons, over into
Idaho and down the columbia to the Pacific.  Hang a right and up to
Seattle.

While I hope to post the occasional trip report, I have found net access
on the road to be spradic at best.  You can find access to a web browser
in a lot of places, but telnet is usually disabled (paranoid ignorami!)

Anyhow, if you see a beige '80 Vanagon along that route, it's probably me.
If the rear quarter windows are &quot;stained glass&quot;, it is certainly me, wave!
