I've never seen any stock curtains for sale, but I made mine and I'd be 
happy to make some for you.  What I did was get an upholsterer to screw 
some snaps into the inside of the car and then put up funky fabric on 
thick shoelace-like stuff so they're open and closeable.  Look at the 
picture on my website and you'll how cool they are.  Easy to do and you 
could do it yourself, too.
