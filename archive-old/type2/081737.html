Subject: [T2] heat exchanger &quot;rebuilding&quot;


&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; I thought I would write about what I am doing to my
&gt; heat exchangers. Before I pulled my engine I removed
&gt; both heat exchangers. They were in pretty rough shape.
&gt; They have rusted apart from the header pipes inside
&gt; them. There are also a couple or more rust holes in
&gt; them. Well, I took a handy flat screw driver and
&gt; hammer and pried each heat exchanger apart at the
&gt; seams. I them cleaned each piece and bead blasted the
&gt; inside and outside of the heat exchanger sheet metal
&gt; as well as the pipes them selves. Today I ordered 2
&gt; pints of the manifold grey , high temp (1400 F) Por 15
&gt; as well as the 20oz bottle of the metal prep. Over the
&gt; next few days, I plan to weld in pieces of sheet metal
&gt; to sew up all of the holes that the rust left behind.
&gt; I will POR 15 each piece and crimp them back together.
&gt; I will then put a coat on the outside after I finish
&gt; up the tack welding. After all this is done, I will
&gt; probably buy some exhaust seam sealer and go over all
&gt; the seams to make sure that the air goes where it is
&gt; suppose to. All in all, I will have spent less than
&gt; $40.00 apiece making them functional again. If I can
&gt; get them to last a few years than I feel that I have
&gt; not wasted my time or money. Any way, I just thought I
&gt; would share.
&gt;
&gt; Have a great day!
&gt; David Kelly

I have the 79 with the 2 litre type 4 engine, and I bought some used HE's at
a show, but these turned out to be for the wrong year. (The guy who'd sold
them dissappeared after taking my money.) Rather than go to the expense of
new HE's I also prised the old ones apart and using sheet metal from the
replacements was able to patch the originals very effectively. They've run
OK for 3 years now.
