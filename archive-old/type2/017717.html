Subject: I got dem Solex blues.
Message-ID: &lt;3719CC73.4F0AE06D_at_fullcomp_dot_com.au&gt;

DATA:  '74 bus with 2 Litre motor rebuilt from an 1800 fitted with Solex

34DPSIT-2 &amp; 34 DPSIT-3 carbs (just rebuilt), manual transmission.

DILEMMA: Happy with vacuum (yep its Vacuum Man again) not idling
or running smoothly and lacks guts.

GENERAL STRATEGY: Stuff around with it until  I find something that
makes it work better.

STEP 1:  Get torch and big magnifying glass, look down throat of carbies

- hmmm  fitted with size 50 pilot jets and Solex 100 air correction
jets.
 Huh? My manual reckons 150, 160 or 175 air correction jet. Where did
these
carbies come from originally? What size jets should they be? Oh well, it
runs.

STEP2: Check manual. Linkages and fast idle links all synchronised?
Nice.

STEP 3: Look for the central idling system cutoff solenoid. Not there?!
Never was.  Oh well it ran before without it.

STEP 4: Pull off initial mixture cut off solenoid.  Weird thing. Does it
work?
Couple of leads to a spare battery, yep - can hear it click inside and I
can
suck through the little hole at the end only when hooked to the power.
Whatever the thing is supposed to do it seems to be doing it OK.

STEP 5: Idle mixture enrichment assembly (you can get RSI just
describing one
of these things you know). Flushed with success at making the last thing
click
and do something, I pull this one apart. Strange thing this - little
cylinder and
leaf thingo. Tried my old trick with the battery - nothing clicked or
moved.
Disappointed, I pull out the trusty multimeter and check for continuity
between
the 'power in' plug and the body of the cylinder. Yep. Why am I doing
this?
Dunno, just fishing and trying to flush out something.  Let's pull it
apart.
 Oops! the cylinder thingo came out and the little wire from the power
in plug
that sticks into the end of it pulled out.  Look around frantically,
nobody
looking?  Good.  Stuff it back in and cross my fingers.  Consult manual
again
- &quot;detach the assembly noting the position of the two 'O'-rings.&quot;  Two?
Did
you say two? Oh well, one out of two aint bad.

STEP 6: Take it for a burn to warm it up before setting idle and timing.

 Driving along flat road, no wind,vacuum at 5&quot;, speed 81kph - could be
better
but at least its going.

STEP 7: Set idle and timing - remembered to take vacuum line off this
time
(inner glow &amp; pat on head). Go for a burn. Humming along flat road, no
wind,
vacuum at 5&quot;, speed  91 kph.  Hey, we're getting somewhere! Not quite
the
98 kph it was doing before but hey, the sun is shining and the birds are
singing.

STEP 8: Hook up tacho to double check idle speed - hey whats that vacuum
line
doing ?  Woops.  ...  hehehe.

STEP 9: Put vacuum hose back on distributor (inner chill &amp; unpat of
head)
But wait! If it did 91 with the hose off ...?

STEP 10: Take it for a burn along flat road, no wind, vacuum at 5&quot;,
speed
100kph !! Yes! Alright !!  High five!  Steer back onto road. Ah, aint
life grand.
Get back home but feel so good I'll do that little job for my darling.
Drive 1 km
down road. Park for 15 minutes. Start motor.  It barks at me!  Am I a
dog that you
should bark at me? Coughs, splutters, backfires. Oh well, its  running
like a dog
so I guess its fair enough that it should bark like one. Hang on, this
feels like the
other day when I left off the wire that connects the automatic chokes
and all
those solenoids. Check it - nuh, they're all there.  Limp home,
crouching low in
the seat as all the neighbourhood dogs come out to challenge this new
loudmouth
on the block.

STEP 11: Check out all the connections again - all there, nothing seems
amiss.

STEP 12: Speed up idle with idle speed adjustment screw so it doesn't
stall
and start pulling spark plug leads off one by one.  Get to No.3  - motor
is
utterly unmoved by the loss.Oh great! Maybe its just a plug. Take out
plug.
Hang on, check compression before putting spare in.  We have
compression!
Silver lining appears on dark cloud above.  Try new plug.  No deal.
Still doesn't
care if I take number 3 lead off. Lead seems to be sparking onto fan
housing - bit
erratic though - nothing regular enough to dance to. OK, I'll just pu
...!!!!YAH!!!
Yep still sparks! Maybe its the lead. Swap with another lead to see if
the
problem travels with it; make sure we change end on the dizzy too.
Nope, still
unmoved by this loss. OK.  Let's check No. 4 again.  Huh?  Last time the

revs dropped when I took it off but now it is unmoved by this loss as
well. Where
has all my beautiful vacuum gone? Now reading 12&quot; at idle Where will it
all end?
It's still chugging though.  I have visions of the black knight in Monty
Python's
Flying Circus minus both legs and both arms crying out, &quot;Come back and
fight!
Its only a flesh wound!&quot;

STEP 13: This is not funny!  I had sun on my back, the sound of birds in

my ears and a song in my heart for a 25 minute summer and now its gone.
What's going on here?  Just when I got it going ... WAIT A MINUTE!
THERE AREN'T ANY HIDDEN CAMERAS AROUND HERE ARE THERE!?

              No?

Oh well, its getting dark and I just don't think I've got another night
grubbing around in the engine bay by the light of a torch in me at the
moment, to be honest. Then there's the love of my life who is getting
pretty snarky about this 'other woman' that seems to take up all my
time and the odd matter of  the five kids who like having a dad.
What to do?

STEP 14: Have dinner, feel a bit sad and perplexed and spend some time
with my darling.

STEP 15: Fight back, muster all my strength for one last struggle for
the
day, stagger to the keyboard and call .......    SUPER LIST!!




               That's you.
