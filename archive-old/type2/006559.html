Hi Seth,

    I didn't mean a &quot;Boxer&quot; (flat apposed engine) engine, I meant an
&quot;inline&quot; such as a Rabbit, Golf, Jetta engine. If your starting with a
diesel its a natural, with very little extra to buy. It makes a very smooth,
powerful, reliable vehicle, the one Volkswagen let get away! Like I said I
have been driving one over five years now, I love it!
    At any rate, if anyone would like to discuss the details, parts needed,
or to have it done, contact me off list at volksfix_at_bellsouth_dot_net
