&gt; I spent a half hour or so pulling a BN4 off of a bus in San Diego, then 
&gt; decided it wasn't a high priority. So I left it there. It's at the 
&gt; Ecology in Chula Vista. Not the one at Brown's Field; the other one. The 
&gt; heater is standing under the left rear wheel on the bus second closest to 
&gt; the entrance. I have no idea what they will want for it, but I imagine 
&gt; much less than it's worth.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, down the street from the Ecology, at Pick-Your-Part, there is a 
&gt; Westy that just came in with a BN6 in it. That's all I know.
