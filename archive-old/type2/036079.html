Subject: smelly left turn - gas filler tube fix?

All knowing list:  what's the fix for the rotten gas filler tube (from side
of van to the tank) that stinks every time I take a sharp left turn?   I
understand the replacement part is unavailable?  What have folks done to fix
this problem?

TIA,
Christopher Darilek
