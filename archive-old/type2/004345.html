Subject: squeeking brakes

Hey List just a quick question. When I step on my brakes in the 74 Westy the
right side squeaks loudly. I pulled the wheel and checked out the pads but
they look brand new,nice and thick pads. I was wondering if the hydraulic
piston could be stuck in the open position cause I cant seem to move it.
Drained some fluid and pushed it in but when I pumped the brakes couldnt get
it to move either way. still squeaks too. Help! Also list this week I head
to Houston to start my third round of chemo for my dreaded Melanoma. Wish me
luck and I'll be back in a couple of weeks I hope.

Todd 74 Westy,
