I would be curious to know who made yours. I doubt it is made by the same
outfit that makes the currently available ones if it has lasted that long.
Yours may be a bugpack unit, which was the original item, the empi is a
knock-off. The bugpack was made in the usa.

I had the current one, made by empi, and have seen several others fall apart
on other peoples buses. There is one detail that works against it lasting.
The bracket that supports the muffler to the collector on each side is
terribly designed. It is a 3&quot; piece of angle iron welded to the muffler body
and collector. The muffler itself is very thin material, and when it is
stressed by this bracket, under heat and combined with the large crude weld,
the thing just rusts away all around the weld and once this happens the
muffler is toast. Every one of these I have seen falls apart at this
connection point.

As for the fume issue, I can also confirm that this happened to me when I
ran the dual exhaust, though it was also because I had a poor rear hatch
seal. But the same poor seal with a stock muffler fixed the &quot;fumes inside
the bus&quot; problem.
