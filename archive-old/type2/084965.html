Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds

You need disc brakes for those speeds in addition to suspension and engine 
upgrades.

Porsche, Subbieroo, Corvair - all sort of engine options. Big $$$ either way.

You'll either have to get comfortable with those 55 mph speeds or buy a 
waterpumper like a GTi for the commute.

Nice $1200 '84 200K rabbit here locally with recent service, all the 
records, new tires and new axles.

For the price of a big conversion or a car payment you could be running 
down the road with a/c.

Save the bus for the weekends.

I'm going for a Corvair engine but I know it still won't be up to modern 
speeds and standards.

&gt; &gt; I appreciate your position.  I've got well over 100k of bus-driving under
&gt; &gt; my belt now and my driving varies from one extreme to the other.  If I'm
&gt;on
&gt; &gt; vacation, cruising down a the open highway just before sunset with the
&gt; &gt; windows down and no traffic, I am happy with 55mph for hours on end.  If
&gt; &gt; I'm late (and come on, it happens to the best of us) or upset about
&gt; &gt; something like coming back from the vet after I had to put my cat down, I
&gt; &gt; will sometimes keep it floored through the first three gears and sometimes
&gt; &gt; even into 4th but I have full instrumentation and even then I know full
&gt; &gt; well what it could lead to and I accept that.  If it dies, it dies and if
&gt; &gt; something is ready to break, better to have it happen near home than on a
&gt; &gt; cross-country trip.  There are also those days here in Dallas where we
&gt;have
&gt; &gt; 25-35mph winds out of the South and when they are with me, the bus feels
&gt; &gt; like it has an extra 20hp.  Once in a while on those days I like to take
&gt;it
&gt; &gt; up to 80mph briefly and pretend I'm driving Mike Gensler's bus.  :-)
&gt;
&gt;After reading everyone's posts about speeds, I think it is pretty apparent
&gt;why I did damage to my bus, and it is need of a build.  I tried again to
&gt;check the valves, and even though I can't turn the pulley 360 degrees, I can
&gt;get it close enough to the top on each stroke to tell that there is
&gt;something really wrong on #1.  Congrats to those of you who said I was
&gt;probably having valve trouble...  you are probably right.  That means
&gt;rebuild time.  I like David live in the Dallas area and will never be able
&gt;to stop driving like that...  so my related question in all of this is:  how
&gt;do I make my bus more suitable for the way that I drive?  Type IV?  V-6
&gt;Conversion?  Beefy Type I?  It's a 70 stocker right now. Turns over but
&gt;doesn't run for those who don't remember any of my &quot;not running&quot; posts.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any guidance.
