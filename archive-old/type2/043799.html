Subject: [T2] Engine, Tranny Swap Questions

Hey Everyone,
    I'm getting this '70 Sportsmobile next weekend, the only thing is it is
missing the tranny, drive shafts and engine.  I was hoping to find out if I
can use a '74 tranny, '72 drive shafts and a '74 Bug engine in this thing.
    I know that the early and late Bay trannies mount differently.  No rear
tranny carrier on the early bay.  I don't have the Bus in front of me and I
can't find a good picture of the front mount on a early bay in my Bently.
I'm thinking the front mount on a '70 and a '74 is the same?  As long as the
front mount and the drive shafts are the same the '74 tranny with '72 drive
shafts should work, right?
    As far as the engine I was going to go with one of those rear carrier
adapters that mounts to the oil pump.  I'm not real fond of those adapters,
but I'll just use it until I can locate a good case with the apropriate
mounting holes.
    The other thing is this bus was taken off the road due to an engine
fire.  As far as the wiring, I know the best thing to do is replace the
whole harness.  Since those wires really heat up and get pretty warm a lot
further upstream than just in the engine compartment and can become very
brittle.  A total harness replacement is not an option for my budget, so how
far back do you think I should go when rewiring the harness?  Thanks for all
the help!

See you down the road,
