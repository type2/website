Subject: Ambulance Fans

Hi Volks- I have a pair of ambulance fans (they fit in the existing duct
work) for a 68/71 standard or Westy. Comes with fans (which work), original
dash switch, and wiring diagram.  The rubber gaskets are all there and it is
a bolt in installation. If anyone is interested, I want $250.00 plus
shipping. These are a VW factory option. Ted (please reply off-list to
tedebare_at_type2_dot_com.

Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it....
