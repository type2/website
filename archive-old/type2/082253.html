Subject: Re: [T2] Friday-Deadheads and busses


&lt;&lt; ) Deadheads in general are NOT bad bus owners, but the younger the bus 
owner\deadhead, the worse shape they keep their bus in. &gt;&gt;

I dont necesserily believe in this statement...  I am 19 and i keep my bus in 
pretty good shape... do regular valve adjustments and oil changes, keep my 
stuff in the cupboards,keep all the trash in trashbags...
