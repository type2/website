Paul:
Maybe that works for most people, but for those of us lucky enough to live in
the rust belt, the real answer is to put on NEW e-brake cables. Couldn't be
more than about $20 each, I'd guess.

&gt; Turns out the cable was completely frozen
&gt; inside its guide tube.  There are two cables, one for each rear wheel,
&gt; that run from the rear brakes, through a metal tube, and meet up front
&gt; under the cab.  I disconnected the right cable at both ends, shot
&gt; lubricant down the tube, and muscled it loose.  It works fine for now.
&gt; Hope this helps.
