&gt; Sheet metal screws?  Excuse me?

well, mine is fastened with sheet metal screws. maybe i will correct myself
and call them body bolts. they have a deep thread, captive washer but a dull
tip, not a sharp point. the holes in the frame are small, they may have had
6mm machine screws at some point and the fasteners i have were put in later.
the frame is quite thin, so this type of fastener would make sense, as there
is no depth for a machine screw to thread into, and no captive nuts in the
frame.

i tried finding the specs in ETKA, but i couldn't locate the belly pan.
