Subject: Urgent Plea

Dear Folks,

If you know *for sure* who's got the Bus Tour hubcap, please ask them to get
in touch with me at pearlgrl_at_bellsouth_dot_net. Better yet, if *you've* got the
hubcap please let me know so I can set up the new web page.

For everyone else who has had the hub cap, please do a trip report and
either post your photos or let me post them on the new web site. Everyone is
dying to know what's been happening!

TIA especially to the list gods who have been so understanding!

Chris and Gus the &quot;That hubcap must have axle grease on it!&quot; Bus
