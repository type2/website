Assuming a relatively level &quot;playing field&quot; and a decent running bus...
[Following assumes a LHD Bus]

A big advantage for new drivers, or those new to a manual transmission, is
that you can depress the clutch pedal, engage 1st gear, then gently ease up
on the clutch and a Bus will move off smoothly WITHOUT applying any pressure
to the gas pedal.  Once under way the new driver can ease open the throttle
to &quot;accelerate&quot; up to the desired speed.

Demonstrate the different steps with robot-like motions, including
exaggeratedly moving the shifter through the angles and corners of the &quot;H&quot;
pattern.  The new driver/shifter will take note of the dork-like appearance,
but will also get a strong visual impression of the various motions.

Emphasize doing only 1 step at a time.  Start with driver's hands on the
steering wheel, no feet on pedals.

    1.  Depress clutch pedal with Left foot.  [pause]

    2.  Move shift lever into 1st gear with Right hand.  [pause]

    3.  Ease off clutch pedal with Left foot, and let Bus move off at idling
speed.  [pause]

    4.  Ease throttle open to desired Bus speed.  [pause]

By going through the 4 distinct, methodical, steps the new driver can work
out the getting under way drill one step at a time, without fretting over
coordinating several actions at once.  New driver/shifter will quickly
perceive that nothing breaks or falls off the Bus while using this little
drill, and confidence will build.  As proficiency is gained the 4 steps
gradually begin to blend and become &quot;automatic&quot;.

With the moving off procedure working fairly well the new driver can apply
the same basic strategy to learning to shift into higher gears while under
way.

The Bus's low gearing, low engine speed torque, relatively light weight ,
and somewhat &quot;agricultural&quot; overall engineering allow it to be driven this
way on flat terrain without stalling.  Bucking and stalling are very
upsetting to new drivers/manual shifters, and have been responsible for a
lot of folks refusing to ever again try to drive a stick shift vehicle.  Get
them rolling from a smooth start right away and they're hooked.

FWIW.....
