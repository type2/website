Hey everyone,

My best friend and his family (2 small kids) are broken
down near Cottage Grove Oregon. They are in a 71 bus;
oil light came on, engine &quot;seized&quot; according to my buddy.
4k on &quot;new&quot; motor. Is there anyone out there that can
recommend a place in the area to check out his bus? His
bus is at a Chevron station, and of course I am very
concerned about the care he could receive there. They are far
from home (Petaluma, CA.)  and Hans knows very little about
mechanical things. Please call him on his cell phone:

Hans 707-953-9735

or me at home in Portland:
Jeff  503-282-0345

or at his friends house near Ashland, Oregon tomorrow:

Hans 541-899-7395

Thank you so much for your help if you can,


Jeff Golden
