Subject: Re: [T2] rear wheel play?

Chris and others; 

I removed the rear wheels last night and played  around with the hubs. The
play I felt at 12 and 6 on the right rear was very  very slight at the hub,
not enough to worry about for now. No play in and  out. The play at the
left rear was slightly more, and it would also move in  and out a small
amount, similar to how you describe (and the axle nuts are  tight with
cotter pins in place). 

Certainly the bearings are worn. I  suspect that they will be ok for my
upcoming trip, as they roll smoothly and  quietly and have been freshly
cleaned and repacked. 

I don't have time  to replace them anyway, but things should be fine for
the trip and I'll get  to them in the early fall. 

Thanks all for your help and suggestions.  Hopefully I won't need them from
the road! 

Back in 18 days...off to  the Rockies at last!

I had the same problem on my 74 bus for about a year. I had to keep  
tightening the rear right 46 mm nut every couple of weeks, when I made sharp  turns I 
could hear a grinding noise. After a while it started to shear the  cotter 
pin, I believe what was happening the nut was jumping a  thread or two shearing 
the cotter pin. I replaced the wheel shaft (spindle)  and that corrected the 
problem. Picked up the wheel shaft at a junk  yard for $15 bucks. That 46 mm nut 
has to be tightened about 200ft pounds or  better.
