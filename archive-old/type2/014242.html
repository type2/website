Subject: oil leakage question

Hi fellow listees. For some time now my 72 Westy has 
been dripping oil something awful. Within minutes of 
parking it there is about a 3 inch puddle that 
acumulates directly underneath where the tin bolt on to 
the heater boxes. In fact, it appears that the oil first 
drips on to the top of the tin before it makes its merry 
way to the driveway. 
A knowledgable friend suggested that one of the pushrod 
tube seals may need replacement. I removed the tins on 
both sides to examine and the outsides of the p-rod 
tubes seem fairly dry. The places where the oil really 
accumulate are the the mesh fan cover and the top tin 
inside the engine compartment right behind the fan and 
everything underneath from the fan forward. 

So, my question is; do i need to replace the reatr main 
seal, or is there somewere else I could be looking for 
leaks.
thanks
mike
