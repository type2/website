Volks,

For other reasons entirely I was Under the '80 this afternoon and happened
to notice the exhaust pipes.  Last May (and 15,000 miles ago) when we
installed this engien, John Anderson and I went out to find some sort of
coating for the very-expensive, NLA, CA-only crossover pipe.  We stopped
in at &quot;Calhoun Speed Shop&quot; (no, I'm not making that up :-)  and bought a
spray can of VHT exhaust and manifold paint and John applied the whole can
in 4-5 coats.  That paint stuck!  and it is doing its job!  After all this
time and all those miles, there are some minor rust blooms, but overall it
looks very nice!  

Some points of interest:
Prep is important! John Anderon had sandblasted that pipe pretty
well... on the heater box, which was not sandblasted, the paint has not
held up near as well. 
The paint is obviously nears its limits. As you go over near the cat, the
heat is having bad effects.
Also, I also remember that this stuff stunk for *weeks* as it cured, 

but I think I can feel safe in saying &quot;we have a winner&quot; in the
long-sought goal of finding a rust preventive for exhaust pipes!

I have put a picture of the coated pipes at:
