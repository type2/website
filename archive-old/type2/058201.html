Help!

In the middle of a rebuild on a '79 (square exhaust ports) with california
emissions setup, and I found out that I've got a major crack in the exhaust
manifold between #3 and #4.  I've heard that this part is not available
new.  Anyone out there got a good used one?  Also, what is the insulated
jacket on this manifold for?  I could weld my existing manifold, but I
don't think I can re-create the insulated metal jacket.  Is the insulated
jacket necessary to keep head temperature down?

I need a good new or used passenger side heater box for this van.  I would
prefer original, as long as it is in good shape.
