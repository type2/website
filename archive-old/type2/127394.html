Subject: rough idleing

i recently had my bus tuned up i replaced the plugs and the wires and the cap and rotor. After i got home from buses by the mill 1 1/2 hours each way i noticed my bus was idleing really rough and after i went to start her up my bus stalled out. Luckly i was at a friends house who hooked up a timing light which didn't send a steady bean so i got concerned so i called a fantastic friend and machanic after explaining to him my problem he said it could be either problem

1 cold start injector

2 head temp sensor 

he said to start with the cold start injector or i guess they call it the 5th injector if that is the problem does anybody know where i can buy a cold start injector or do they refer it as a different name  any help would be grateful just to let everybody know i had a fantastic time at buses by the mill
