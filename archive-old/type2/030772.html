I just wanted to take a second to say thanks to Bob for delivering heads
to me the same day I called him, and at a darn good price too! 

Indio Dune Buggy installed them for me while I watched. What a treat to
finally see my engine apart and back together! Though I could have done
without the cost! It took them a little longer than I would have liked
(2.5 days) however I think they did a good job, and I certainly learned a 
lot. There are a couple of remaining issues that I need to sort out, but I
will post about them in the near future.
