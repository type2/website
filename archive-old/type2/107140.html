Subject: Re: [T2] retarding #3

&gt; i would venture (and put on a flamesuit!) that since the mantra from
 1946 to 1970 was 'retard #3 to avoid preignition on it' that it just
 stays that way out of habit.  if there is something else that would
 cause #3 to run hotter, preignite,  and require the retard, i'd like
 to know what it is.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My guess is the person with the retarded #3 has a cheapo rebuilt dizzy. Sure, the VW part number on the
housing is correct but someone may put earlier parts inside.....
