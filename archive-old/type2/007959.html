Hope y'all enjoy this, I did.

Yesterday, I was crusin' in Mr. Bus to meet my wife for lunch (a rare
treat) and as I headed down the boulevard, a bay window high top camper
merged into traffic. Two things caught my eye; he had Alaska plates, and
sticking out of the roof was a piece of 3&quot; stainless steel stove pipe with
a rain hood. I just had to smile.

Hey, maybe this dude has the answer for all of us cold and damp Bus
drivers. Wood heat.
