Subject: Re: [T2] Can we weld new exhaust manifold flanges on our heater

You need to get yourself a diet coke, or some jello and calm down.

Perhaps he was asking in case someone had tried.
Perhaps he was asking in case someone had failed.

The point is he was asking, and that's what this list is for.

I mayself am a pretty decent welder, and I myself have considered the
opposite, using the existing flanges and making a custom exhaust. And I would
have asked a list, but probably not this one now, if anyone had tried before
me.

&quot;I hope this explanation wasn't too harsh to digest.&quot;

ditto.
