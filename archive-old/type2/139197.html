Subject: RE: [T2] Best Battery Cables.

Chris,

Premium copper wire that is completely tinned (each individual strand of
wire is coated with a tin/lead alloy) is available at boating outlets in
various sizes. This wire is great in wet locations as it will not corrode as
readily if moisture is wicked up into the wire.

Additionally, Richard Atwell shows the proper use of heat shrink that is
coated on the inside with a mastic that totally seals a connection. I use
both the tinned wire and the heat shrink... keeps battery acid &amp; water out
of the end of the wire, and provides for additional stiffness at the areas
that tend to flex.

Do 'em up like this and it will be the last time.

Is their such a thing as thicker battery cables, or maybe cables made
out of something other than copper that's better?
