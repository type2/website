&gt;It was such a contrast to this list that I feel the need to pat
&gt;everyone on this list on the back for being reasonably rational,
&gt;supportive, encouraging; for having a healthy respect for logic; and
&gt;most of all for having a sense of humor about our buses and for
&gt;generally being pretty good eggs.

It's not just this list; I'm also on the Type 3 mailing list (y'know, 
Squarebacks 'n stuff) and the overall feel and maturity level over there 
is much the same as it is here.  I even try and cross-pollenate some 
of the technical info from there into the T2 world when it's potentially 
useful .. such as that Goodyear 5/16inch &quot;not for fuel injection&quot; hose 
passes a 250psi burst test and is just fine to use on our FI systems 
(info from a T3 listee who works at Mahle-Parr's filtering &amp; testing 
facility in Iowa)   :-)

I think a lot of it simply has to do with &quot;us&quot; being owners &amp; enthusiasts
of &quot;vintage&quot; aircooled VW's who aren't building racecars.  That and 
good moderators.
