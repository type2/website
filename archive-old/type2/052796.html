&gt; I have an exhaust leak around the heads where the heater box mounts. I

Hi Merdith,

In my opinion this is not a common problem (unless of course you know a lot 
of slipshod mechanics/owners).

When replacing the heat exchangers new gaskets should be used. The gaskets 
have thin metal faces with compressible material (asbestos?) in between, I 
would guess that old ones have been reused resulting in a poor seal.

Will this damage your engine - in the long term yes, as one side of the 
engine will no longer be balanced with the other one. This will also result 
in poor idling (see others experiences in the archives).

The lower pressure in the exhaust system will also reduce the engine braking 
causing longer stopping distance (noticed that straight away when coming up 
to a queue of traffic just after changing to a slightly larger bore exhaust 
system on my previous bus)

Also you could find yourself with a 'ticket' for a noisy/defective exhaust 
system.

Good luck
