Subject: synthetic oil/post rebuild

I'm just fininshing up putting my engine back together following an AVP
rebuild on my 79.  I eventually plan to run Mobil 1 synthetic, but will
will use regular dinosaur juice initially for break-in.  My question is;
how long should I wait before I make the switch to synthetic?
