  &gt; When I get my van today, first thing I am going to do is pull the
  &gt; motor.  I assume it used to have FI being a 74...

'74 would more likely have originally been dual carbs; they switched to FI
late in '74.  (If the ECU is still there that would be a telltale sign;
often when people remove the FI they don't bother pulling the ECU.)

  &gt; I want to put a 2 liter in it....will the tin and all that fit the same?

If you use the '74 heat exchanger setup the tin should be the same.  Even
with the later heat exchangers, the modification would be relatively minor.
However you will need to use the flywheel from the '74 engine.
