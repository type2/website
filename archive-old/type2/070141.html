I recently acquired a 65 (I think) camper from a guy's yard and would like to
know some history on it. Here's all the numbers from the badge on the air intake
vent: 

    VOLKSWAGENWERK AG
        Made in Germany
    Typ 23 - 42
    HERZG. TYP 2/255    A Prutz. S45
    Fahrgest. - Nr. 235122940
    Zul. Gesamitgew.kg 2070     Baujahr 
    Zul. Achslast vorn kg 950   hinten kg 1150

I don't think the bus was intended to be exported to the US because the VIN
number isn't in a list of numbers from the Wolfsburg West catalog, but I may be
wrong. I don't know. Any help? Hello? Please? Could someone explain what all
these numbers mean? Thanks.
