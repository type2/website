&gt; Auto tranny engines can and do come out alone, do it all the time, the
&gt; auto tranny doesn't have the long power shaft so it doesn't have to be
&gt; pulled back any more than needed to clear the studs on the bottom of the
&gt; engine.
&gt; 
&gt; only thing is be sure the small oil pump shaft for the tranny does not
&gt; come out with the engine, sometimes it will. it is free floating so just

actually thinknig about it, don't worry about the pump shaft. it is on the
other side of the torque convertor which will stay in the tranny housing
when you remove the engine, make sure you clear the pump shaft when you
remove the torque convertor, which should be done AFTER you have removed
the engine,  just make sure the torque convertor remains on the tranny
while you remove the engine.  shouldn't have a problem the torque
convertor rarely moves when you pull the engine.

another hint, don't lose or forget where you put the 3 bolts from the
torque convertor to the flex plate that you take out through the access
hole on the engine. they are not interchangable with any other bolt on the
bus. truely a unique part and NLA from VW.  I have found a 13mm deep
socket works best in taking em out and putting em back, on a 1/4 inch
socket wrench.

the way I put em back is to put a 22mm box wrench on the alternator bolt.

line up the lug on the torque convertor by looking through the opening in
the bell housing from the underside.  then getting inside and working
through the access hatch.  lay there and reach up to the 22mm box wrench
and turn it slowly while VERY CAREFULLY feeling the flex plate turn until
a hole is lined up in the opening, then use a probe to line up the flex
plate.  stick the bolt in and $#_at_^%$ until it catches a thread.  don't
pull the first bolt down tight, just snug.  then do the other 2 the same
way, then torque all three down to (my opinion) as tight as can be done by
hand on a quarter inch socket wrench,  officially by Bently it is
18flbs.  but you never want one of these to come lose while driving, ask
me how I know

sorry for the confusion
