&gt;I'm a little confused about a component in the fuel path on my '81 Vanagon.
&gt; A fuel line comes out of the tank into a black box (the fuel filter), into
&gt;the fuel pump, then into a cylindrical can.  I would think that the can is
&gt;a fuel filter, but why 2 fuel filters (one of which comes after the pump)?
&gt;Any help here???


Strictly speaking on an '81 there &quot;should&quot; only be one.  If 49 state, the
plastic square block before the pump, if CA the metal cylinder after.  The
cylinder is a much finer high pressure filter.  In point of fact, it is an
excellent upgrade for maintaining the condition of your injectors, and early
wasserboxers have both.  In '87 or so there was a recall claiming that the
block style filters had been reported leaking and they were removed from all
wasserboxers so equipped, with the VWoA line that &quot;they were only to remove
initial junk from the tank at first startup.&quot;  This is in fact a stupid move
mainly because their prime importance is to protect a very expensive
($150-$250) fuel injection pump from rusting tanks and poor quality gas
stations.  About this time the pumps definitely started having trivial inlet
screens, some of the older have them, some don't.  The take home message
here IMHO is keep both, and replace definitely the plastic one frequently,
and the high pressure unit every 30-50k or so depending how anal one is.  I
retrofit the high pressure unit to any T4 FI vehicle, it is available from
your FLAPS listed for '80-'83 CA vans or '83-'91 wasserboxers for about $15.
I've never ever seen one of grey Bosch or common white Israeli plastic block
filters leak BTW, I inspect them frequently, replace them every spring or
15k or so, as they are only $5.
