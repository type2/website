Subject: Re: [T2] Type IV rebuild video

&gt; Does anyone out there have the Type IV engine rebuild
&gt; video (the one with Jake Raby?) that they would lend
&gt; to a fellow listee. I would like to preview it before
&gt; I buy it. I would pay shipping both directions.

I have seen the video and it's well worth the money. It's about 3 hours
long.  The first hours is a quick tear down of an old motor and the next two
demonstrate the complete rebuild process.

I think VW Trends is currently running a Type IV rebuilt series of articles
from Jake covering the same material but in printed form.
