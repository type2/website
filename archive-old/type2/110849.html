Subject: Re: [T2] changeing oils in the crankcase?

Chi, you are using the same brand of oil just one
weight, changing to the multi weight won't be any
problem for you , just drain and replace with new oil.
The oil in these cars have been a big discusion, I
just listen to them and use the oil I like, I use
Havoline 10-40 in all of mine and have not had a
problem for the last 25 years. Of course I have my
flame suit on, the list will get me for saying this. Phil
