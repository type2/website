&gt;Hi Volks- The '71 parts bus that I just got has a perfect wood headliner. I
&gt;would like to remove the front section and install it in my bus. Never
&gt;having done this before and not finding any info in the archives, can anyone
&gt;give me some advice, tips, information ,etc. so that I don't screw up the
&gt;headliner pieces during the removal and installation. I'm only doing the
&gt;section over the front section. As always, TIA TBear
======================&gt;
I'm starting the same act on Casper Monday, and wondering what I'll run 
into, as well.
