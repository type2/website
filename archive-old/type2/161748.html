Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Sub Questions - water leak, will a deep cycle run
  an amp?

&gt; First question - Does anybody have a &quot;9 times out of 10 if your floor is wet
right there it is from...&quot; kind of answer for how the water is getting in
there?

The camper windows or pop top itself (if you have one) would be my guess.
&gt; I am thinking that today may be the day to finally order the wiring kit for
a second battery and make it part of the project.

It would make sense to run power directly off your 2nd battery to the amp to
power the subs and whole system. Then you can park and jam and not worry about
a non start when you are ready to leave.
