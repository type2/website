Question 1.) Does a type I thermostat have the same range of motion as a
type IV?  This would be good, if I am to substitute one for the other.

Question 2.) I've seen a number of responses on this list over the years
along the lines of Steve Trembley's &lt;stevet_at_whidbey_dot_com&gt; recent comment:

&gt; Any mechanic who insists the t-stat is unnecessary is someone you should
&gt; *never* take your VW to, unless you live in a 180 F climate.  They're
&gt; (sic) thinking caps are broken.

And yet here in coastal southern CA (average temp 72 F), any number of
apparently pretty good, pretty smart, pretty competent VW mechanics
routinely remove or leave these thermostats off of type IV engines. I've
had guys I otherwise trust argue with me about the value of putting this
thing back on my engine. What's up with that? I smell a little bit of
dogma here.

Discussion of Question 2.) Although I generally agree with the idea that
the original engineers studied this system a lot closer and harder and
better than anyone else is ever likely to and anything they put on the bus
must be there for a good reason, I wonder about the value of this
particular feature in this particular climate.

The defenders of the faith (who may live in colder climates?) might say,
&quot;Oh yeah? Well just try it and you'll be sorry. Your motor will wear out
faster than one with a thermostat.&quot; But for my experiment (and most of the
rest of us), n=1, I have no control group. and alhtough I'm several years
and about 50K miles into my experiment now with it might take me another
5-10 years to drive enough miles to wear out my engine and get one data
point for an inconclusive graph. All I've proved to myself so far is that
the effect on my engine is not dire.

I'm an amateur VW mechanic. I work on one bus. I look to people who work
on lots of buses for advice about how things affect engine longevity. What
am I to conclude when a handful of guys on the type2 list contradict the
behavior of the large majority of mechanics in my (mild climate) region?
Has anyone out there actually seen a whole lot of type IV engines that
lived their whole lives in a warm climate with and without thermostats and
taken systematic enough notes to really offer some good empirical data on
the value of the thermostat WRT engine longevity?

FWIW, John Muir says you should have a thermostat on your bus if you live
where it gets &quot;Even a little bit cold,&quot; with no example of a place that
might qualify. But back then this part was available and oils were
different.

My oil temp gauge warms up to 180 F in just about 6 minutes of driving.
About the same as before my thermostat pooped out. Summer and winter are
about the same. And I have an auxiliary oil cooler (also without a
thermostat bypass) that ought to be making things warm more slowly.

Should I really go to the trouble to track down a $50 part in Canada, or
undertake a welding project (and a retrofit solution to the adjustment end
of the cable, that seems to strip and require replacxement every time I
look at it hard) to equip my bus with something that most southern CA VW
mechanics never use, even though I've noticed no difference in warmup time
(its ostensible function) with or without it?
