    Hi All,

My local FLAPS has been a tremendous help over the past year and a half, and
I doubt I could have come this far without their assistance.  They have
always given me the best possible price for new and used items that I have
required during the restoration of my '70 Camper.

So yesterday I call them up and ask them for a price check for the five
major door seals - left door, right door, cargo door, rear cargo door and
the engine compartment door.  She said no problem and said she would call me
back.  They order from WCM, so I gave her the part numbers.  She called back
and left a message.  I nearly fell on my _at_ss - with tax, $600.00!!!! (That's
in Canadian Funds).

Now don't get me wrong, I have no problem spending money on quality and I am
a firm believer that if you're going to buy something, spend the extra
money..its worth it.

Well, I think I will pass in this case, 600 bucks for five pieces of
rubber..I don't think so.  Perhaps if this was a show bus and it is not, I
just want to keep the water out.

Can anyone suggest a less expensive source for these seals?  I noticed in my
JC Whip-Me catalog that they sell all sorts seals for about $20 for a whole
roll, has anyone had any success with any of their seals?
I wouldn't mind spending up to $300 maybe a little more, can anyone
help?...Ron?  I would even consider putting in used seals,, but I haven't
had any success finding some in reasonable condition.  Any other Canadian
bus owners have ideas, I realize that some of the cost is for shipping from
the States.

Thanks for the help.
