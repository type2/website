If DPO ( very D ) of my '76 is to be believed, the GEX rebuilt engine now has
75K+ on it. I'm amazed it still runs, not just because it's GEX, but because
of all the other BS
that was done to it over the years. This is not meant to be an endorsement for
GEX, after all I've read about them, they would be the last folks I'd get a
&quot;new&quot; engine from.  Jeff S.
