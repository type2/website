&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you keep your bus lloking like shit, you obviously don't take a great
&gt;&gt;deal of pride in it, or respect for it...if you don't respect your bus,
&gt;&gt;then why do you subscribe to this list...?

&gt;&gt;OK,OK, enough...flame me if you must...go on!

&gt;THANK YOU!
&gt;
&gt;I feel the same way! Her Majesty is beautiful and the idea of trashing
&gt;her to make unattractive to theives is beyond me. Glad you had the guts
&gt;to post that!

Guts?  I think that was a total loser post.  I am very offended by this
person's implication that I don't take pride in, or have no respect for my
bus.  My bus may not be beautiful on the outside, but I have had it for 9
years now and I don't intend to ever sell it.  I have spent hundreds of
hours and thousands of dollars working on it.  I have driven it on many
terriffic camping trips all over North America and met many great people.
As for why I subscribe to this list, that's a stupid question, and coming
from a nameless newbie like &quot;fusion&quot; I'm not even going to bother
addressing it.

Kathy, I don't think anyone is talking about trashing a bus that is in nice
shape just to keep it from being stolen.  In my case, I have simply left
the exterior in close to the condition I got it in.  I don't see the point
in spending thousands for a new paint job so it will be attractive to
thieves.  At least not until I have everything else done.

fuse this, loser boy (hey, he asked for it)
