Subject: 70 westy FS in Vermont

I just got a call from a friend who is putting his 70 pop top Westy for sale.
 He lives in Brattleborb, Vermont.

It is a California bus, with solid rockers, frame, etc.  The camper kit is
all there, with kiddie cot, bug screen, etc. but no jump seat.   It's a red
camper with white top.  The bad thing is that the bus was in a collision last
year and has a munched nose, but that doesn't affect the way it drives.   The
motor is good, oil seals and brakes replaced a year and a half ago.  Mike and
I did the work on it and sold it to him.

call Duncan at 802 254 6059  rust free, bad nose,  $2,000, come and get it!!
