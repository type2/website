&gt; I have rebuilt 2 engines now and this will be my third (a 1600, 1776 and

&gt; I got the &quot;GD&quot; 2.0 engine from the bone yard (heads missing) for $65 which
&gt; seems like a good price.  Anyway, when I got to taking the six main nuts
&gt; and bolts off the case I found I had to use a long punch (made out of nice
&gt; soft brass) to get out the bolts.  when I got the bolts out there were some
&gt; sort of plastic certs on the bolts which is obviously the reason I had to
&gt; use the punch.  Do I need to get new ones on these for the rebuild?  What
&gt; are they called?  Also,  the front of the case started to split with a
&gt; couple of hits from the rubber hammer and the back seem to be a little more
&gt; difficult.  Do I need to remove the flywheel for any reason before I split
&gt; the case.

Yes, you need to remove the flywheel to split the case.  There are 2 
fasteners surrounding the camshaft endcap.  The lower one (a stud/nut) is 
behind the &quot;bellhousing&quot; portion of the case and can be got at without 
removing the flywheel.  But the upper fastener (a bolt/nut) can only be 
removed after removal fo the flywheel.

The plastic inserts (funny how the manuals don't really warn you about 
these) are a standard part of a gasket &quot;kit&quot;, which it sounds like you'll 
be getting in any case.
