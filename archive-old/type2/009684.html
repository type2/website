Subject: the clutch shutter bug
Message-ID: &lt;19990604063757.26379.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

The old 80 westy is getting ornery once again...

Big problem #1:  Shifting into first is becoming quite a chore.  No matter 
how slowly i let up the clutch it shutters like mad.  It also does it in 
reverse but not as bad.  Smooth as butter going into 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.  I 
checked the motor mounts today, tightened them up a bit (they weren't 
loose), but still shuttering.  They don't look busted, but i don't know 
exactly what busted motor mounts look like (yes, i am new at this).  Is it 
time to drop that old engine and put in a new clutch? or should i look 
elsewhere?

Little problem #1: While rambling around the local bone yard i found a 
tach/gas/H20 gauge in an old scirocco (sp?) that fits perfectly in the hole 
that formerly held my non-functioning clock/gas gauge (to which i might add, 
is up for grabs if anybody is interested, free).  Anyhow, now to wire the 
bugger...I've got it in and working, however i didn't hook up a ground, just 
the 12v power and the wire to the coil, and (here's the situation) it seems 
more difficult to fire up.  Turns over fine, just takes a few seconds longer 
to start.  If i detach the wire from the coil to the tach it fires up just 
fine.  Could this be related to not having grounded out the tach? if not, 
should i ground the tach regardless?

your wisdom is much appreciated
