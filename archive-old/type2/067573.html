&gt;&gt;Sorry I forgot to mention I am in Smyrna Georgia, a surburb of Alanta.
&gt;
&gt;Thus do Mr. Easterwood's neighbors find that there is yet another carcass
&gt;in his front yard for them to complain about. ;)

I would be happy to look at this bus and take pictures for anyone if 
they interested, but I am not interested for myself.

I think I know this bus, if it is pearl white over velvet green.  I 
looked at it a couple of years ago in Acworth, GA and passed on it.  
Had a good engine, but bad brakes and front end (lane-hopper).  I 
told a friend who told a friend in Roswell, GA who bought it.  He 
supposedly re-did the brakes on it.  After a year and a half, his 
wife laid down the law and insisted on a &quot;new&quot; car.  He traded it in 
on a Mazda or something and was impressed that the dealer gave him 
$2000 trade-in on it.  I held back my laughter as he had never bought 
a car from a dealer before, and obviously did not know &quot;the game&quot;.  
There is no way in hell this bus was a &quot;lot car&quot; so I am sure it went 
immediately to auction where it was sold for about $400.

Mr. Easterwood's neighbors and the Marietta City Police dictate that 
Mr. Easterwood has officially reached his transporter limit with 10 
vehicles currently in the driveway and backyard.

It is time to &quot;clean house&quot; and I will be posting ads later this 
week when I get some photos together.  Most are in &quot;mint condition&quot; 
unless we go to &quot;truth in advertising&quot;, in which case they are rusty,
hacked-up beaters.  :)

Dave
