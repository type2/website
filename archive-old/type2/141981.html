Subject: computer in VW woes?

Volks,
I'm going a bit crazy trying to resolve this. I've a 77 camper. Engine 
rebuilt 10K ago. The valves are hydraulic, the injectors seem to test 
fine. Good air flow, no overheats. Most of the time, I drive 35-55 mph. 
Rarely am on freeways. Oil changes evry 2500 miles.

Situation:
1.    At first, I got 24 mpg, now only 13.
2.    When I drive it, the engine cuts out like electrical off at 74 
mph.

Trial Solution:
1.    We swapped the computer and I've done 85! 2.    But, the 
replacement computer did not improve mileage, and it became hard to 
start in either elevation or cold days.
3.    It began to crawl at take offs.
4.    It struggled to climb hills with power loss! Ouch.
5.    My mechanic said the swapped computer didn't match my computer's 
codes exactly, and so it may not be playing nice with my FI'S. He said 
they are sometimes finicky about computers being married to FI'S.

More Problems:
1.    Now the original computer is back in. Engine still has a crawl 
feeling to it at take off. No power is intermittant. Happens mostly if 
I've either nearly stopped, or tried to hurry up from dead stop.
2.    Mileage remains poor.

Ideas??
Timothy.
