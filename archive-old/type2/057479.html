OK - you guys are NEVER gonna convince each other this way!!
As the late Mr Hoover once noted, the ONLY way to prove either viewpoint is
get SEVERAL buses set up IDENTICALLY
except for :
A) no flaps on one
 B) no seal on one
 C) no flaps, no seal
D) ALL flaps and seals.
Just for kix, have busses with seals but flaps closed, and no seals but
flaps open... and some with flaps REMOVED.

Place manometers (and tufts, as Mr Lyle says) on them all to measure air
flow and pressure, and sprinkle CHT,
oil temp and pressure guages liberally.

Drive IDENTICAL routes, conditions and styles for A YEAR.

Then compare data.

It may have occurred to someone out there that this has been done already

 - by VW.

This whole debate seems pointless to me, just like 'best oil' debates and
any other knee-jerk OPINION
 issue we've had on this list - state your opinion, maybe make A defense if
you have to, and move on.
Taking it PERSONALLY that someone doesn't agree with you is senseless.
Information for either viewpoint is only that.  Its up to the individual to
choose the route to follow,
newbie or old fart, and some people can't be persuaded to your point of
view by screaming
 at them (lord knows i've tried :)).  People go with what works for them.

I personally think my engine is too expensive a thing to risk it by
foregoing a $20 seal and some $30 dollar
flaps and thermostats. But then, I have four guages on the beast, too.

Harmon and others, drive on w/o seals, flaps or brakes for all I care, and
good luck to you. I'll even stop and help you when
your bus breaks down... and I'll try and resist the temptation to offer you
a seal for your next engine :)
