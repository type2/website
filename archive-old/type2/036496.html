To the List:

I saw one of these in Tucson last month on my annual trip to see if the
sun
still exists.    I want one!  This though kept circling through my brain
all 700 miles home.  Is it possible to hire a Mexican citizen to bring  a
&quot;used&quot; one over the border and buy one from him?

Have fun
