Subject: Re: [T2] Charging Problem

From: &quot;Casting Fool&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;
&gt; ... This is a heavy red wire with a round flat connector (with a hole in
it) on the end, the sort that would be held in place by a screw.

Actually, this might be a new connector added by a PO.  The wire appears to
have a new end spliced onto it.

Um... this couldn't possibly be the wire that charges the battery, could it?
