Subject: RE: [T2] Actual shipping

&quot;OK. So I go to Roy Rodgers and buy a waterpump. Mack put the pump in a
paper
sack.&quot;OK Gil, he says, &quot;that's 25 for the pump, 9.5 for tax, my time for
getting the part off the shelf is $5.00 and putting it in the sack is
$7.50.; Total cost is............&quot;

You know some grocery stores give you a discount if you re-use your bag, so
in essence they are charging you for it.

&quot;What's next? A charge for taking our money to the bank.&quot;

Fleet (that evil large bank here in the Northeast), actually tried to charge
customers extra to go to a teller a year or so ago. It went over like a lead
balloon.

Anyway I just wanted to say I don't mind paying some poor sot on EBay a
couple bucks more to make sure they package something but I agree that there
is a point when it does get a little absurd!
