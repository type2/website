Subject: Oil light problems. . .

	Recently my oil light has started acting up.  Upon
startup it stays lit briefly after the engine starts,
then goes out.  While driving it comes on occasionally
only when I put the clutch in and hit the brake.  As
soon as the engine revs, it goes out.  It doesn't do
this every time, with no obvious pattern except that
the longer it runs, the less frequent it gets.  I have
plenty of oil, compression is 115-120 all around, no
drips.  Bewildering to me.  Any thoughts are greatly
appreciated.

Thanks
