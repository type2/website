Subject: Woe is me.

So I am happily shopping for stuff at my favorite local dealer today. I
picked up some door handles and other broken stuff for my new baby.  When
the shop owner informs me that his mechanic refuses to work on my particula=
r
year of westy.  And he proceeded to list the following &quot;known&quot; problems:

1. Throttle linkage wears out and creates a vaccuum leak on the dual carbs.

2. The engine is hard to access and therefore work on.

His main bone of contention seemed to be the carb situation. He seems to
dislike the dual carbs with a passion. Maybe they stomped on his flower bed
in a previous life. But anyway, I am a little disheartened, how big of a
deal is this? Opinions ideas? :-(

Question #2, exhaust leak near the head on the driver's side. It doesn=B9t
look like its the head itself so I suspect the heat exchanger is cracked.
The question is, can this be done engine in the bus or do I need to yank it=
.

And an update:

To those whose had suggestions for the shifter and no reverse, thank you!
The shifter plate was out of adjustment and now everything is hunky-dory.

Thanks.
