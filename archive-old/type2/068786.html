Subject: Smog II, engine swaps

        Bren,
        Engine swaps are handled by the car is required to meet the
NEWER of the car or engine specs. They officially discourage swaps
but they are legal. But a bit of a hassle. So your '79 FI engine is legal
in the '76, provided the '79 engine has all the '79 smog stuff
AND meets '79 emissions standards. 

        That said, if the '76 and '79 look about the same from
the outside, I'd probably just play dumb. '79 light-trucks &lt;6000lb (that's 
us) have different spec for 79-83 than 75-78, but not way different.

        Relevant emissions specs:
                Pass/Fail spec                  Gross Polluter
(Truck &lt;6000lb) Idle rpm        2500 rpm        Idle rpm        2500 rpm
Years           HC      CO      HC      CO      HC      CO      HC      CO
1975-1978       250ppm  2.5%    200ppm  3.0%    500ppm  5.0%    450ppm  5.5%
1979-1983       250ppm  2.0%    200ppm  2.0%    400ppm  3.5%    350ppm  3.5%

        You don't have to be getting an 'official smog check' to have
the technician pull numbers on your car- there is a diagnostic/tuneup
mode in the smog-check system. If the numbers are good, they will charge
you again to take official numbers but that's a fair risk, my opinion.

        For more info, call California Department of Consumer Affairs:
916-445-3758. 

There's a brochure on engine swap requrements and you can get all the Smog 
Check II data you want.

        And of course, if you want to sell the double cab, I bet
I could help you find a buyer, with or without smog-check :)

        Bill
