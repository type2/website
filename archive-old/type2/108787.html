Subject: Brake Servo Question

Dear Type2 Gurus,
I have a '71 Deluxe that has been losing brake fluid like the bus is drinking
it!  There are no leaks in the wheel cylinders.  yesterday after arriving home
from John Brown's Buses, I crawled underneath and to find what was leaking.  I
saw that the master cynder was leaking, so I replaced it with a spare.  I also
found out that I was losing a considerable amount of fluid at the frontboot of
the brake servo.  I am missing the circlip there.  Can anyone tell me what
size this is?  Thanks
