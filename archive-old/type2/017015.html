Subject: AC For Sale 

Hi Volks......Today I'm removing the dealer installed AC unit out of my
79 westy and will sell the setup for $200.  It's the under-the-dash
style.  PO says it works but I can only vouch that the blower works and
the compressor isn't frozen up.  It is missing the second pulley setup
(and the belt).  I also have the operating instructions.  Call or email
if you're interested.
