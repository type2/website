Subject: Subject: Westy Sink Pump another idea

	...so I went to the boating/fishing section of my local
&gt; Walmart and purchased a bilge pump for like $10 and a piece of hose and
&gt; some
&gt; fittings at the local hardware store for about $2...
&gt; 
	This is the 2nd time I've heard this recommended.  My only question
is &quot;what's the difference between bilge water and drinking water?&quot; A lot.  I
think the price and performance sound great, but is the pump adding anything
like grease, plastic, etc. to the water?  Does the spec. sheet that came
with the pump mention &quot;other uses&quot;?
