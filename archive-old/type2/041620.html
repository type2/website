Subject: Advice on rebuilding twin carb 2L 1979

Dear All,

I have a 1979 German T2 with a 2L engine and stock twin carbs..
(we did not get the injected version over here...)

There is some anecdotal evidnece that the PO had the engine rebuild in 1988. 
in any case the engine seems OK since the compressiong test are 150 for 
cilinders 2,3 and 4 and 140 on 1.
I tried to balance the carbs but was told by the local BOSCH service centre 
that the carbs would benefit from a good clean and possibley a rebuild.
how much trouble is it for me to rebuild my carbs? are new replacements 
available?
What spares will I need and where do I get them.
Also how long does it take? I have some mechanical experience but never
opemed up a carb apart from a lawnmoar a couple of years back..

IE is it feasable to rebuild the carbs my self and then get some help 
settign them up or should I just leave it as is?



Thanks for some comments.

Lukas
