&gt;I found the source of the noise. It was the fuel pump.
&gt;1. should it run with the key in ACC?

It's wired to do that apparently. carburated pancake motors from 72-74,
when people got rid of the twin carbs and switched to center carbs, sometimes
junked their stock mechanical fuel pump and switched to an electric aftermarket
one, which is mounted on the body above the transmission and is usually called
'facet' and is usually wired to start pumping when the key is turned to the
first notch, when the idiot lights come on. I don't know why people went with
this pump, probably because it could deliver more fuel for a dual barrel center-mount carb, and probably because the
hose connection diameters are similar.

On the 75 FI motor, it might have replaced a bad stock fuel pump, which are much
more expensive to replace?   I remember that the 75 computer sometimes wouldn't
cut off or cut on the fuel pump - maybe someone else will know.....

&gt;2. is this original equipment?
&gt;(cant find it in my manual but then again I never heard of a CLYMER shop
&gt;manual)

Clymer manuals are okay, but not the best. Closer to Chilton than Haynes. Haynes
are more better.


&gt;3.and the $64 question do I need it?

See if your stock pump is still there and if the diameter on the carb intake and the stock pump intake coincide.
Maybe you can bypass it and see if the old pump delivers. Unless there are aftermarket carb pressure needs
that the stock pump couldn't deliver
