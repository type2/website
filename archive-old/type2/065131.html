&gt;I'm looking for a left rear corner panel for my '66 23 window bus. I see in

&gt;my only recourse to obtain it from a bone yard bus?

You have 2 choices: find one NOS, or get one off another bus.  An NOS corner
will probably cost you upwards of $300-$500, depending on who you get it from.

I don't know of anyone reproducing the whole corner.

&gt;Is there any advantage or disadvantage to leaving the electrical system 6
volts?

The only advantage is in keeping it original.  I don't know of a single
performance or techological advantage.
