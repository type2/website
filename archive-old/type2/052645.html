&gt; Whether anyone likes it or not, Hooper owns Type2_dot_com.

Actually it is not at all clear who owns it, or if one person even does.
There are at least three separate people who could arguably be held to own
it IMO. There is nobody who claims veto power.

The real list admins deserve a lot more consideration than me, certainly,
and have for a long time. So do the people who continually improve the
content on the web site.

What's important is that it has never mattered who owns it--we've been able
so far to deal with this in an atmosphere of cooperation and respect, if not
affection, without anybody threatening to take his ball and go home. I'd
love it if that could continue.
