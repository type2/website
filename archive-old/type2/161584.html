Subject: workarounds

The windshield wiper stories reminded me of this:

We got married April 14 2003, at Dana Point, CA (on the beach). It rained 
before and after ceremony, we even stapled up painting tarp to the gazebo to 
protect from the rain - but the best was yet to come. Honeymoon was in a 
cabin in Big Bear. Hubby's Jetta defroster gives out at the base of the 
mountain, and it begins to SNOW pretty well. When we get half-way up the 
mountain, we're turned around by the police to go get chains on the car. 
Bottom of the mountain, we buy and install chains, and all the while, it's 
snowing, snowing, snowing more. We get 1/2 way back up the mountain, and 
we're the second-to-last car in before they close the highway.

We still have 1/2-way to go - and hubby has NEVER driven this road before. 
(steep, jagged switchbacks, you can see the cliff's edge when it's not near 
white-out conditions). We're almost up to the dam, and it's white-out, can't 
see more than 6-8 feet ahead, and we're following in the tracks of the cars 
ahead of us - until they overheat and pull off to the side. Hubby is loving 
it! &quot;I took my driver's test in a blizzard in Ohio - this is great!&quot; All the 
while up the mountain, I'm in my wedding gown wiping the inside of the 
windshield every four seconds with a squeegee so we can see through the 
fogged glass.
We got in to the cabin okay - about 6 hours late - and the report on the TV 
the next day told us that there was 14 inches of snow dumped on us as we 
trekked up the mountain!!! Icicles were on the cabin a day later, more than 
a foot of snow on the ground - in APRIL, in California!

On the way back down a week later - all the snow melted off - hubby nearly 
wet himself when he realized how steep and curvy the roads actually are.
