Subject: Re: [T2] wiring schematics for an AUTO trans 79 Westy?

&gt; The lights on the floor for the drive selector aren't working, and I cannot
&gt; find a schematic anywhere as to how to trace them back. I have a grey wire
&gt; with a red stripe hanging by the fuse panel, but am afraid to hook it up to
&gt; power in case I fry something. My thought however is that it may be the wire
&gt; that is for the lighting on the floor selector (you know, 1,2, D, R, P) :-)
&gt; Does anyone have a schematic or could trace theirs? The bulbs seem fine but
&gt; no lights at night.

exploded drawing is on page 43 of the Auto tranny section of Bentley, the
power for the selector light is from the instrument cluster lighting if I
recall. the wiring diagram is the supplement A on page 42 of the Bentley
wiring section, goes to fuse #1
