Subject: 70 bus for sale in S. Calif

70  bus project / parts for sale.  I had planned to part this bus out a
couple months ago but had some things come up and didn't get time to do
anything with it.   I bought  it to
use for parts for another bus I had.
It's a sunroof bus, has front seats and a rear seat, no middle seat.  The
body is decent on it.  The glass is complete, doors are good, has dash and
steering column, front end, no engine
or trans.  I'm asking $125.00 for it now.  I'm in Hesperia, (Southern)
California.   See links below for pictures and email me directly if you have
any questions about it.
