Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds


I run at 65 to 70 on the highway, slower in the hills obvioulsy. If I'm in
a hurry I may run at 75 for an hour or so but rarely push that speed for
too long. Bus doesnt seem to mind just burns too much gas. I dont know that
carbs or FI would really have a terribly huge impact here. I think RPM and
temps are most important. I dont have a tach so I couldnt tell you about
the RPM. I dont floor it. If I climbing a big hill I will floor it then
back off a touch, downshift when necessary and keep the  revs reasonable.
Sorry for the vagueness here but I dont have my guages installed yet, and
there seems to be some discrepancy over the numbers there anyway.

&gt;
&gt; David hit the nail on the head here. Best engine configuration I have had
&gt; to date is the 2.0 FI type IV. Putting one of these together right is not
&gt; cheap though. Heads are critical, you need to have them done by someone
who
&gt; knows these heads and can replace the seats. Thats about 5 bills there.
You
&gt; will probably want a good web cam to improve performance and head temps.
&gt; about 150-200. New pistons and cylinders 250-300. Balancing is extremely
&gt; important IMHO to a long lasting smooth running engine. Then theres
quality
&gt; bearings and seals, good exhaust and heat exchangers. The list goes on.
&gt; Unless you have the skills or are willing to be patient and aquire them
my
&gt; advice would be to buy a motor from Jake Raby or Boston Bob then do the
&gt; install yourself. You can transplant one of these 2.0 Type IV's into your
&gt; bus but it will require some mods including a late model tranny. Disc
&gt; brakes are a must as well.
&gt;      That said I would consider building a mild type 1 motor. Maybe 1776
or
&gt; even 1835. External oil cooler (full flow of course) dual carbs. Good
&gt; balancing, mild cam, good heads. Probably can be done for $1500. The list
&gt; is probably your best resource on motor tips. If you  really want to go
&gt; fast though you don't want a bus you want a sports car.

&gt; &gt;rebuild time.  I like David live in the Dallas area and will never be
able
&gt; &gt;to stop driving like that...  so my related question in all of this is:
&gt; how
&gt; &gt;do I make my bus more suitable for the way that I drive?  Type IV?  V-6
&gt; &gt;Conversion?  Beefy Type I?
&gt;
&gt; How fast do you want to drive?  One thing I can say for sure, if you want
&gt; to cruise at more than 60mph reliably, you are talking a big investment,
&gt; like in the neighborhood of $2k.  Probably best to sell the bus you have
&gt; and buy a 76-up bus with the 2.0 and Fuel Injection.  What's more, with
the
&gt;
&gt; '70 you don't even have disc brakes, and you really want to be able to
stop
&gt;
&gt; well if you're going to be driving that fast.  Sorry I don't have a more
&gt; pleasant answer.  :-/
