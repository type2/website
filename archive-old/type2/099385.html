Subject: Distributor too short?

Hey List, 

While setting the timing and adjusting the valves today, noticed that the
rotor (Cap was off dist.) wasn't moving all that much as I turned the
engine. Pulled the Distributor out of the case,  and noticed that the 2
teeth at the bottom of the rotor are almost shaved off about a 1/16 inch
from the end, likes it's not long enough or something. (it's not sitting in
the notch).

Any ideas, could there be something wrong inside the case?

Thanks, 
Trey Jung
