I think you lose a lot more than horsepower with the Type 1 engine.  
The Type 4 engine is superior in many ways, and was designed to address 
some of the problems with the Type 1 engine... better case, better oil 
system (better oil cooler, and has a full-flow oil filter) ... those 
are the things that leap to mind immediately (I'm glossing over the 
internal details here).  You can also readily get hydraulic lifters + 
cam for a Type 4 engine ... I don't know how readily available those 
are for Type 1 engines (though I do know you can get new Mexican Type 1 
long blocks with hydraulic lifters).

You might also need to custom-make tin for a Type 4 -&gt; Type 1 
conversion... I think the engine bays are fairly different between '71 
and '72 (the engine mounts and the fan shroud are quite different 
between the two engine types).

I also think you're looking at a fairly expensive Type 4 engine 
rebuilder.  Bus Depot sells AVP-rebuilt 2L Type 4 engines that have 
improved valve seats and hydraulic lifters for ~$1099.95 + $400 core 
(solid lifters slightly cheaper, but why on earth would you want solid 
lifters :-).  1.7L and 1.8L for $979.95 + $200 core (presumably these 
have solid lifters).  AVP seems to have a good reputation, and there 
are at least a couple of fairly active people on this list with AVP 
engines who seem to like them.
