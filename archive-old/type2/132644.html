Subject: FI air fuel mixture adjustment (long)

Mike:

I too have a '79 westy with the stock California FI setup.  Things were 
great until a few years ago when the original engine dropped #3 valve 
seat at 147,000 miles.  I purchased a turnkey rebuild from AVP and ever 
since I've had problems burning valves.  I just installed my third set 
of heads in the last 20,000 miles.  Since my bus is completely stock 
with all tin, engine seal, themostat in place and properly adjusted, 
I've spent the last few months trying to verify whether I've got the 
proper air fuel mixture, because I know that a lean condition will 
cause high head temps that could result in a burnt valve.  I have no 
access to emissions testing equipment since emissions testing is not 
required in Indiana and I haven't been able to find a shop that has an 
exhaust gas analyzer that is willing to test my bus.

Anyway, this is what I've done.

I installed a cylinder head temp (CHT) gauge (with the sensor under #3 
spark plug) when I installed the latest set of heads.  At 60 mph on 
flat ground at 75 degrees F, my CHT gauge reads close to 500.  From 
what everyone tells me, this is hot.  Remember, that all of my cooling 
tin is  in excellent condition and is present.  My oil temp runs around 
210 to 220, so I believe that the cooling system is working properly.  
I suspect that the gauge might not be very accurate.

I've also tried measuring/adjusting the Fuel/air mixture using the 
oxygen sensor. To do this, I jumper the two wires for the FI throttle 
switch together to disable the lambda control loop in the FI ECU.  Then 
I connect a digital  voltmeter to the oxygen sensor lead and to chassis 
ground.  It is important to have a good digital voltmeter for this with 
a maximum/minimum/average function since a good oxygen sensor will 
provide a voltage reading between 0 and 1 volt DC, and this voltage 
will fluctuate rapidly.  From what I've been able to read, you want to 
adjust your mixture so that your median reading is approximately 0.45 
volts (450 millivolts), with readings lower that this indicating a lean 
mixture and readings above this value indicating a rich mixture.    Now 
I've tried this, and I've not been completely confident in my results.  
I was able to get a change in my average voltage reading by adjusting 
the gear in the AFM.  I enriched my mixture (to 0.6 V) by loosening 
spring tension on the AFM (by about 10 notches, but my CHT still reads 
close to 500 F at 60 mph.   like I said, I'm not terribly confident in 
my readings, and I would like to get a verification using an exhaust 
gas analyzer.

So what I've done is to purchase a air/fuel mixture gauge from CB 
Performance.  This gauge costs around $100 and works off the oxygen 
sensor to provide a stable reading of air/fuel mixture.  I just 
received the gauge and haven't yet installed it, so I don't know how 
well it works.

I'm curious to know how you used vacuum to adjust your AFM.  I'm not 
certain, but it would seem to me that the more vacuum=better adjustment 
formula might be flawed and might leave you with a lean condition.  How 
does it run when you do this?
