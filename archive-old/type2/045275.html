Subject: [T2] Got it!  My &quot;new&quot; BUS!

After weeks of waiting, I have my bus.

I went up to San Jose from Fresno yesterday to pull it out of the weeds and
hopefully get it running so I could drive it back today.

After realizing that the only thing preventing it from starting was an empty
gas tank (yes, I'm a genius, that only took about an hour) I baked it out of
it's pomegranate tree cocoon and commenced washing off five years of gunk
from the inside and helping the PO's remove 5 years and 2 teenagers worth of
athletic equipment.

There is really no rust that I can find.  A bit of surface rust here and
there, but nothing like what I'm used to (Washington, DC - East coast rust)
After an oil change (it was pitch black and smelled like...guess) and some
air in the tires and a few gallons of new gas, we took her out for a spin.

It's been a long time since I grappled with no power steering - I thought my
71 Land Cruiser with 36&quot; tires was hard to steering without power steering -
man!

Anyway, after my meeting today we set off back to Fresno.  I had no
expectations.  The bus (with stock 1700 and dual carbs) was running well
enough.  The idle was a little off, and the lights in the rear were
intermittent, not to mention some kind of exhaust leak somewhere , I think,
so I wasn't sure whether or not I would make it back, and had my AAA card
ready to go.

Well, I expected a typical holiday San Jose wait down the 101, but was
surprised by very light traffic.  How great, I thought.

I was unprepared for what lay ahead.

10 miles of bumper to bumper traffic to get to the mountains took 2 hours.

She never missed a beat.  I was stunned.

Once we got to the mountains, I had to grapple with the first 4 miles of
straight up, and , as expected, did the whole 4 miles at around 30-35 mph.

My fiancée, who was following me is our Toyota Pickup, thought the whole
thing was terribly amusing.

Either way, We made it up the hard part, and after that it was smooth
sailing at around 70 mph the whole way to Fresno.

The only problem I had was some fuel spillage around corners - unknown
source - probably filler tube is rotten or vent tube is missing/broken, and
severe, hot, heavy white smoke the pours from the passenger side intake
 think?) on the back pillar. The two are no doubt related. Smell like oil or
something burning, but I can't tell - any ideas?  Regardless, first purchase
tomorrow will be a new fire extinguisher.  ;)

If you are in or around Fresno, drop me a line. I need to get a couple
things (interior pieces and front tire cover) and need to know good sources.

Thanks,
