             today i have a bit of a problem my clutch is slipping like mad
and i have a pool of oil on the drive it's fairly obvious that the rear
crankshaft seal has let go can anyone out there give me any tips on getting
the job done quicker like separating the flywheel,replacing the seal as the
72 1600 is the only one i have on the road and i need it for work!!
