Subject: CV's and Molybdenum Disufide

Got a question---
And the answer may not be a simple one.

For years I've been using a high temp, high surface tension, anti wash
out grease on the chassis's of Macks--
as well as the CV's on my vehicles--

Now, I was just thinking-( Danger )
While this stuff is a super grease--it mentions nothing about containing
this moly stuff on the drum--or anywhere--
It's a Citgo product--

Now, I'm at one of my favorite emporiums of parts -- and here is this
little squeeze tubes on a display shelf of &quot;CV Moly Grease&quot;

I read it--it's a high temp, anti wash out grease, but when I squeezed a
dab on my thumb--and laid my index finger on it and pulled it away from
my thumb--it didn't string like the high temp grease does--
Like it is a lighter grease--

Another problem is the stuff seems to be a lighter grease--therefore in
my mind not having the shear strength, and the anti wash out capacity of
the high temp stuff I'm using--

Whats with the Moly?

Doesn't all ( most of ) all greases have this stuff in it???

Just curious--I'm in the mood to be doing a mass CV joint PM--and need
to know what you guys think--

Take Care,
