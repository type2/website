Subject: portapotti installation &amp; tire well use

 Andy McKinley mentioned hiding the portapotty in an upholstered &quot;ottoman&quot;
in the stool spot of the 72 Westy.  This can nicely be done in the older
Westies with the rear facing seat behind driver, which I did in my 71
camper-I &quot;extended&quot; that seat by taking the vinyltopped stool and building
a front wall and rear wall that just hid the small Sears portapotti, with
the stool top (remove legs unit) set in and held by window latches- lift it
up, and use the potti!  Then using some scrounged matching yellow vinyl, I
made a padded hinged BACK to this (hinged off the sink unit- swung away to
let you step thru, swung back to let you carry TWO people in rearfacing
seat!  It locked in via simple sliding bolt.  Great for sitting around the
flip up table. The later Westies have that _at_^##$% spare tire cover
extending out into space, which I cut down flush, added hinges to create
door, shelves, and now can fit the stool/trash can between the front seats
just behind seat belt bars, and put my truck drink holder/catchall between
the seats in front of stool.  The small porta potti fits there now too if
desired, but I keep it in the well in front of fridge (take away the table
holding pipe first), and my kid puts her feet on it.      The cabinet
created in spare tire well holds all my tools/spare stuff, and tire goes on
front of van.  So there!  Mike Benthin
