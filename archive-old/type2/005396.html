The long awaited arrival of the krusty '71 westy is over.  I purchased this
van from a co-worker over 6 months ago for $1.  I just couldn't find the
time to get it towed over until today.  It was parked over 11 years ago.  It
was still running at the time.  Almost fully complete, including childs cot
over the front seats, camping stool, and a couple of field mice to boot!
Just need a good source to replace all those cracked cabinet handles.  It
needs a little bit of rust work, mainly the windshield and cargo bay window
seals.
    Now I just got to figure out to convince my neighbor, Patrick Flynn to
help me start this thing!  Wish me luck on extracting the other mice,
spiders, and ants that were displaced from their slumber in the woods.
