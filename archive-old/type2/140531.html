Subject: Re: [T2] T2 Bay

From Lima:

I'm restoring it and I found a lot of troubles I
bought it without any engine. I had to find one.
luckely a friend had a Type fot CU 2.0 lt more, and
sold it to me. a bargain. now i'm trying to change the
4 spd to a five 094 speedbox T25 engine. Everybody
tell me I'm nuts. Am I wrong? I found a lot of good
gentle people says no way. Why?

 please aid me to find an answer.

You were repeatedly told that this swap will not work without major major modifications.  The bus trans has a 
out-the-front shift shaft. The T3 trans out of a 80+ Vanagon has side shift shaft.
