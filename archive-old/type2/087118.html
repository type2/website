Ray,

Thanks, I had second thoughts before I got your post and went looking, but 
didn't find these!

Interesting to note that BUG was filed on 
Filing Date   October 20, 1998

and BUS was May 2nd, 1961.

I can't figure out what all of the extra verbage is on the &quot;bug&quot; one 
though.  It makes it sound like *all* of the people who currently have 
&quot;bug&quot; in their trademark are in violation.

Now!, I am truely getting p.o'ed about this.  Sounds to me like all of the 
people that have bus or bug in their name need to get a defense fund up 
and see how far it goes....I did notice that one of the places that had 
&quot;bug&quot; of somesort in their name was an insurance company...they generally 
have money to fight with.

I noticed after I figured out how to work the site, they even trademarked
&quot;Drivers Wanted&quot;.

The world is getting weird, dave
