Subject: RE: [T2] Who does a good job rebuiling 2.0 L long block in the
  US

My next one may well be a Raby or BB, put my current
engine was acquired when business was down after 9/11,
so I went for the lower-middle price range...AVP in
Sacramento charged about $1200 (delivered).  I had to
send them my core first (included in the delivery
fee), cuz they didn't have one handy.  But it was nice
to get my fairly low-time case back.

They will convert a solid-lifter engine to hydrualics
if needed, for a small extra charge.

IIRC, AVP reuses certain parts if serviceable (like
intake valves).

The engine had no problems, and is running fine after
10,00 miles of short trips, with long hills.
Definately better than a mexi-engine.


&lt;SNIP&gt;
I'm located in Chicago/Milwaukee and in need of a
rebuilt 2.0 L long block
engine. I'd prefer to get one with automatic adjusting
valves (78-79
version). I can pay for high quality work (not
interested in cheap salvaged
engines), but don't know who is doing good work
