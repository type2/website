Subject: Want a '71
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am looking for a 1971 Bus or Westy. Hopefully someone out west will know
of one with a rust free body that is available. Mechanics are secondary. I
plan on restoring the vehicle to be a reliable everyday driver while
traveling to VW gatherings (BBTA-Circle Yer Wagons, etc.) This is going to
be a fun ride rather than a show bus such as my 75 was. Hopefully, someone
out there will know of one. Please p-mail me with any leads. PS There will
be a finders fee for the right bus. TBear
