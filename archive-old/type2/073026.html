&quot;OK, as I heard it....  the air intakes at the upper rear corners of the
bus were a metal grill in 1980 only.  In 1981 and later years, that was a
rectangular cutout with a plastic insert.  I am certain given VW's &quot;mid
year change&quot; policy that there is at least one 1981 out there with metal
vents.&quot;

that would be Jenny who is an '81 Westy with the metal vents :-).
