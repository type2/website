&gt;
&gt;Hello VW buffs!
&gt;
&gt;I am moving to california soon and need to sell my '67 transporter. am
&gt;looking for quick cash! It's a camper with center pop top, fold down bed
&gt;&amp; table, split windshield. I drove it a year ago, but it has been parked
&gt;since. runs fine, transmission is good. has rust-needs body work and TLC
&gt;from a friend. has extra wheels and misc. parts.  engine and
&gt;transmission have been rebuilt recently. worth much more, but will
&gt;sacrifice at $500. I have owned her for over 20 years and don't want to
&gt;leave her alone. want her to go to a good home.... The bus is currently
&gt;in central Maine near Augusta, if interested, please call (207)
&gt;377-9371. or email kate_at_sciencenetwork_dot_com
&gt;
&gt;
