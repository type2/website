Over the last week I've replaced both tie rods, all 4 tie rod ends,
the steering dampner and finally the drag link on our '72 Bus.
Before I did this work the steering had at least 5 inches of play
and would jerk over all the bumps.

This morning driving into work was a dream!  Steady steering
wheel and cruising over bumps without having to pull the Bus back
on the road!

If you have slop in the steering, check out the drag link (the bar
going from the steering box back to the tie rods, partially hidden
by the belly pan under the pedals.)  That's where most of it came 
&gt;from on our Bus.
