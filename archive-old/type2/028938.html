I am having night mares about these switches. They explode when you take
them apart. There are springs and ball bearings everywhere. The rheostats
are just thin copper wire that gets burned out after the years. It's like
brain surgery. I would not recommend it but, you could argue that I have a
bias opinion.

Hello All:
Has anyone out there ever dis-assembled a bus headlight switch?  I just
bought one off of *-bay, with the intention of cleaning and re-conditioning
the contacts and rheostat.  I just want to know if there's anything unusual
to look out for.
Thanks,
Jim Hood
