Without a guage, if your pressure is bleeding off, the bus should have to crank
for a longer period after sitting overnight.  That's what mine is doing now.  One
long start in the mornings, then immediate startup the rest of the day.  I'm going
to try a couple of ways to isolate and identify the offending part.
