Subject: splittie conversion

Although  I do not know if the site is up and running still, this was a link 
to it I found in the archives.  When I originally saw this, I could not 
believe my eyes!  A whole lotta work!!!  Guy is basically rebuilding a bus 
panel, by panel.  Total body off resto.  Strange considering it is a 
unibody.  Quasi anyway!
