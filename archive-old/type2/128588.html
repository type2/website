Subject: Re: [T2] Bus for sale

Had a couple in a $50K BMW try to buy my bus on the spot. Would have traded of course. Wanted to tell them they had no IDEA of what they were getting into. They'd prob dump $5K into it, still have old car problems (that is fix the cosmetics and not address suspension or drivetrain issues), and try to sell it for $5K over market (my price to them). Am trying to buy an '89 Cabrio from a couple who have done just that. Paint, seat covers and top. 170K miles and they are asking 2-3 times over market price (www.kbb_dot_com). 

Now I just point the well off folks to the Eurovan Weekenders. 

Chris
