Oops - I realized what I said as I read this...

What I forgot to say (and thanks, guys, for catching this!) is *not* to turn 
the motor off.  Otherwise, you are absolutely, positively correct... the 
motor will heat up even farther than were you just driving.

It's the same theory as the turbo in a diesel (bigrig) engine... it has to 
cool down before you shut it down; that's why they idle them 3-5 minutes...  
In fact, in those hot Sacto summers, this is not a bad idea, either, on your 
bus.  Sometimes the outside temp doesn't drop below the 90's for days at a 
time.

I still stand by the stopping every hour or so, tho... just don't stop the 
engine until it's cooled down!!!
