Subject: 1975 westy gas tank filler, replacement sequence

Hi, I am new to the list, and I am currently totally restoring a 75 Westy. 
I removed the fuel tank and re an re'd it, but I can't understand how to get 
the new rubber filler at the entry point for fuel filling connection into 
place.  Is it shoved from the outside in, or from the inside out?  I managed 
to get my arm stuck in the &quot;porthole&quot; area where I had to attach the main 
fuel hose to the tank, and need &quot;think smart&quot; info on the rest.  Thanks in 
advance.
