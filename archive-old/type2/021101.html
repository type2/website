I don't use the table- see http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin for
layout ideas and an extra bed.
When my daughter was a child we took away the table mount because it
intereres with a perfect place to store the Pakapotti or the Westy
stool/garbage can, and the table was way too bulky for storing- I made a
flipup table that goes over the fridge area, and one is also on the
sliding door.  Before I put in the 3 person bed, I had a shelf that went
between the closet and the sinkcabinet- relocated the closet door to the
side.  The shelf  held my daughter's stuff and a tv/vcr.  When camping I
have a folding &quot;picnic&quot; table and an awning.

&gt; Hey y'all. Anybody out there have any suggestions as to how to modify the Z
&gt; Bed in a ' 78 Westy so it can be used with the table still in place?
