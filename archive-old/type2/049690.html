Subject: Re: [T2] rolling back &amp; driving standards

Simply do what I have do (I have been driving sticks for 18 years, 73 Bus for 
10)Pull the Ebrake out to hold the van (yours does work right?) Push the 
clutch in, put it in first.  When the light turns, turn the Ebrake handle to 
allow it to go off, but hold it tight so the Bus does not roll.  Let the 
clutch out and as it starts to engage, wanting to go forward, let the brake 
out, accelerate and go on your way.

This has worked on some steep hills in Raleigh, NC when people get too close 
to the rear.

If you hold it by the clutch on the hill, you CAN BURN the clutch out AND 
will SHORTEN it life. It is no fun dropping the T4 engine (OR tranny) to 
replace the clutch.

Using this method depends on the hill and the distance the driver is behind 
you.

You do not need a hill to pratice this method.
