Subject: About clearance of syncro rings for Kombi 77' 1600cc
Message-Id: &lt;199904100522.WAA00237_at_www2.xoommail_dot_com&gt;

Hello Guys,

Finally today i bought the so-wanted syncro rings for my 
tranny. I really needed those! I used to hear those nice 
and noisy &quot;messages from the gearbox&quot;. I can usually not 
downshift to third, cause it cranks, unless i acelerate at 
certain rev's the third won't grab(?)i mean go in). First 
gear is a pain in the a.. too and won't go in either. It 
was allways a fight with the stickshift to make my Kombi 
goin'. The things is: The syncro's i bought today are not a 
42' size(cm ?), like my ones are, they are 41's(cause i 
have a German tranny and can get here just Brasilian parts 
i live in Paraguay!) Can i fit them in without a question 
and they gonna wear in a bit' so they sattle perfectly?! Or 
are those gonna be too tight fitted? If they don't fit i'll 
take them to the rebuilder shop and i'll tell the guy to 
opem 'em up about 0.08', will that be ok or can i not do it 
this way? Another funny thing is that the Brasilian syncros 
for the 1' and 2' are enormus! The messure somethin' like 
60' and my one are completly the same. No diference between 
1., 2., 3. or 4. Gear.

See ya ;)

Michel
