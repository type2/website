Subject: Re: [T2] CV joints on VW Bus: changing the allen key
  nuts????????????????????????

I forgot to add that Porsche 911 cv bolts are the same grade 10.9 black oxidized bolts VW used although the dimensions changed slightly over the years.

&gt;The original bolts are 10.9 and that's all that's required to handle the torque from the stock engine. That size/style fastener is more commonly found in the 12.9 grade which is why your kit probably came with them.
