Subject: Re: [T2] Country Homes Camper?

&gt; But I found a way to keep my post legitimate... WHAT is a Country
&gt; Homes Camper?  I've never heard of the beast.  It sure looks
&gt; interesting,
&gt; though the &quot;detail&quot; pics don't enlarge.
 
Here is their website:

They did bays but I have not seen many of them. Lots of Vanagons though.....
