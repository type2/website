Subject: Re: [T2] Just picked up my new Bus....

Your a newbie so get thee a copy of the Bentley repair manual and John 
Muir's &quot;How to Keep your VW Alive for the Compleat Idiot&quot;. It is the 
ultimate newbie book and very helpful for good explanations of how things 
work and where things are and what things are. Use the bentley for the 
repair procedures and the Muir for a second opinion. There are alot of 
other good books out there as well but these should be your first.

Muir's book will also help define what all the different models are. Type I 
engines versus Type IV engines versus a Type III car and a Kombi versus a 
Campmobile versus a station wagon Type II and a stationwagon Type III....

OH - and REPLACE ALL THE FUEL LINES!!! Because the gas tank is above the 
engine (sort of) if you rupture a fuel line it will leak gas until it run 
out of gas or until your bus is totally consumed by fire. Not really a 
safety thing but a way to protect your investment. Fuel lines get neglected 
by those not &quot;in the know&quot;.

Welcome to Bus-dom.

Holler anytime.
