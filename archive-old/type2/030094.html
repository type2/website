&gt; &gt; I'd personally NOT go with synthetic unless you're running extremely high oil
&gt; &gt; temperatures.
&gt; &gt; What I would do is use straight weight 40 in a good brand. Think about it, on a
&gt; &gt; cross country trip, you might put on 400-600 miles without cooling down.

This is the easiest service an engine can get!  Engines don't get fatigued
and need to rest like we people do.  As long as you keep them supplied
with fuel and air they will continue in a nice steady-state operation at
the temperatures that they were designed to operate at.  It's the warming
and cooling transitions that are hard on engines.
