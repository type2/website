Subject: RE: [T2] Rear Automatic Transmission Mount Wanted

&gt; Bob, I was just informed by another listmember that the first automatic type

right the 73 model year,  75 is when they changed em.  the 411/412 had
automatic in every model year  (71-74 in the USA) 

&gt; I was led to believe by a VW mechanic that the rear tranny mount (on rubber
&gt; mounts) from the 411 or type 2 (he suggested 1970) will fit the 1990
&gt; automatic bellhousing, which is significantly different from the manual
&gt; version later on anyways.  I believe it is the YOKE that i am looking for,
&gt; as it would fit two horizontal holes spaced apart 6-8&quot; directly above the
&gt; torque converter on the bell housing.


right the bell housing is significantly different, but I believe the yokes
are all the same....I may be wrong but I don't think I've ever seen a
different one on the bay window bus. don't know about the vanagon, and the
411/412 I am pretty sure is different, now this is from memory I had a 74
412 automatic myself some years ago.

&gt; &gt; I'm looking for a rear automatic transmission mount
&gt; &gt; from an early (1970?) type 2 bus or a 411.  I want to
&gt; &gt; fit it to my 1990 Vanagon with a Subaru engine for
&gt; &gt; additional mid-span support, and I understand it will fit the
&gt; &gt; top two horizontal holes of my bellhousing.
&gt; 
&gt; hmmmm,, type 2 buses didn't get an automatic until 1975 so an early 70 is
&gt; not an option,  the 411 mount is IIRC slightly different than the bus
&gt; mount and different than the Vanagon mount..?????
&gt; 
&gt; you have me a bit lost,,are you referring to the YOKE which is near where
&gt; the engine mounts to the tranny???  or the front mount at the nose of the
&gt; tranny.... I think all bay window bus yokes are the same..manual or
&gt; automatic
