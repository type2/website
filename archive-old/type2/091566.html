For a show vehicle, a &quot;weekend&quot; vehicle, or a race vehicle you can get
away with a lot, since the extra power isn't used very much.  If
something fails after a couple of years and 10K miles it's no big thing
since you are close to home and wrenching is a recreational activity
anyway.

For a daily driver or a bus that is actually driven on trips, I want much
better reliability than this.  Evidence of this level of reliability is
conspicuously absent from the conversion articles I've read.
