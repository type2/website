&gt; My last question is hopefully a simple one too. I have looked at
&gt; Bus Boys, Bus Depot, and a few others VW related sights and I can't seem
&gt; to find a alternator with a higher output, seems like everyone just has
&gt; a stock replacement. I want to install a relay on the battery so my bus
&gt; and I could use a little electric while camping and know that both
&gt; batteries are getting a good charge while the engine is running.



I'm assuming that your bus has been converted to alternator? Either way
check out www.cip1_dot_com .They have high output kits for 69-71 busses.
