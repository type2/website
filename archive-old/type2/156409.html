Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters and Webcam 107i

&gt; The problem is that if I have the lifters adjusted
&gt; for zero (or.006) 
&gt; lash the engine idles well, but if I turn in the
&gt; adjustors one or 1 1/2 
&gt; turns to actually make the hydraulics work the idle
&gt; deteriorates and it 
&gt; wants to die on me (but it is nice and quiet!).  I
&gt; can bring the idle 
&gt; back up by adding more initial ignition advance but
&gt; I don't understand why.
&gt; 
They will settle in. It takes some time. If you are
working out other issues, try a half turn or a quarter
turn and work out your other issues and don't worry
about the lifters. After you get your other issues
resolved, if there's any valvetrain noise, start over
from zero and turn in a turn - up to 1.5 turns, then
go for a drive. Don't be hard on the engine, but just
go driving. After 10 - 15 minutes, see how it's
idling. My bet is all will be well. The reason the
engine wants to die is that the lifters are pumped up
and will take a bit to work down to the design load -
but it will happen. I had to do it just a couple at a
time on one engine. I think I ended up leaving it at a
half turn on all. Get rid of the noise and a tad more
and you should be in great shape. -BaH
