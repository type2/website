&gt; I think you lose a lot more than horsepower with the Type 1 engine.  
&gt; The Type 4 engine is superior in many ways, and was designed to address 
&gt; some of the problems with the Type 1 engine... better case, better oil 
&gt; system (better oil cooler, and has a full-flow oil filter) ... those 
&gt; are the things that leap to mind immediately (I'm glossing over the 
&gt; internal details here).  You can also readily get hydraulic lifters + 
&gt; cam for a Type 4 engine ... I don't know how readily available those 
&gt; are for Type 1 engines (though I do know you can get new Mexican Type 1 
&gt; long blocks with hydraulic lifters).
&gt; 
&gt; You might also need to custom-make tin for a Type 4 -&gt; Type 1 
&gt; conversion... I think the engine bays are fairly different between '71 
&gt; and '72 (the engine mounts and the fan shroud are quite different 
&gt; between the two engine types).
&gt; 
&gt; I also think you're looking at a fairly expensive Type 4 engine 
&gt; rebuilder.  Bus Depot sells AVP-rebuilt 2L Type 4 engines that have 
&gt; improved valve seats and hydraulic lifters for ~$1099.95 + $400 core 
&gt; (solid lifters slightly cheaper, but why on earth would you want solid 
&gt; lifters :-).  1.7L and 1.8L for $979.95 + $200 core (presumably these 
&gt; have solid lifters).  AVP seems to have a good reputation, and there 
&gt; are at least a couple of fairly active people on this list with AVP 
&gt; engines who seem to like them.

Hello Guys   Let me throw my 2 cents in here all the good things for the type 
4 motor can be had easily with the type 1 motor, oil cooler(we are fabing 
type 4s) oil filter, more HP go with a stroker   1835or 1904 work well ,as for 
sealing you can do a number of things get the south american tin, creative car 
craft makes fiberglass stuff, or go el cheapo and use a truck inner tube. As 
for the type 4 mention remember that those are reman motors, and you didn't 
include shipping, and you will have reman heads ,cam, etc.  Now lets touch on the 
bad points of the type 4 motor, weak heads , always dropping seats, very bad 
design on the oil screen, if you overtighten it the case will break, push tubes 
that always leak,  probably about 125 lbs heavier,which takes away HP. and 
makes working on it a PITA compared to the lighter type 1 ,  also dont forget 
about the case plugs blowing out, I haven't seen a single type 1 motor do that 
but have seen a bunch of the typee 4s do it.  Now the good points   more 
torque?  maybe not with the stroker type 1, stronger bottom end, again you can do 
this with a type 1 ,  last longer ? , depends a lot on the driver,   more HP ? 
not with the weight difference even comparing stock engines , now lets compare 
costs  reman motors  type 1 about a $1000.00 cheaper , you can get a new mex 
motor for about $1500.00 , there are no new type 4 motors, you can build one 
using some new parts but the crank, rods, case will all have to be machined to 
new specs.  I personally like them both and do a lot of work on both, But the 
type 1 gives you more opions at a better cost. Also remember that I drive 
splitties but my tow vehicle is a Sycro.   Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
