Subject: Motor mounts?

Okay, this is probably a stupid question... but do I have to drag the
(insert adjective of choice here) motor out again to replace the motor
to engine carrier mounts?  I'm v. familiar with the job on a
wasserleaker, but have never done the deed on a type IV motor.  Any and
all flames, suggestions, anecdotes etc. gratefully appreciated.
