Subject: email crashed

My email program on my home pc, where I check a lot of my personal and
business email, crashed this morning, permanently wiping out a ton of saved
email files, including all email sent to me personally over the last few
days.

This applies only to email sent to me personally, at ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com or
busdepot_at_email_dot_com - **NOT**  to email sent to the general Bus Depot address
(sales_at_busdepot_dot_com) or via the website form.

However, I do believe there were a couple of info requests, and a request
for a replacement distributor cap, that I saw just before everything
crashed.  So if you sent me an email within the last several days (or
earlier than that if you didn't get a response), I'd appreciate it if you
could resend it. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thanks,
- Ron Salmon
