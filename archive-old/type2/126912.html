Subject: Re: [T2] Re: My post on Matthew J. Ramsey

Thank you for the apology Terry.  I understand how 
frustrations from life fall over into other aspects.  You 
apology is accpeted and no harm is done...  

If you are coming to Kansas this year you are very welcome 
to visit my home, share a meal with my family and camp on 
my front yard.  You will be welcomed in true Buskatier 
fashion.

Your check will be in the mail.  I realize this is my fault 
and hope you accept my apology in the matter.  

Thanks again,
Matthew J. Ramsey

&gt; I humbly apologize to the list, and to Matt, for 
inappropriately airing 
&gt; this complaint and for thinking poorly of him.
