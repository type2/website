Subject: RE: Oil Question

I'm no expert, but I do know that synthetics are not recommended during engine
break-in.  It seems the synthetics provide too good of lubrication, so the parts
that have to seat in and get comfortable during break-in, particularly the
rings, don't get to do this if you use synthetics.  I know there was a
long-running thread on this, either on the VW news group or on V_at_L, and if I
remember the concerns were that the heat capacity of the synthetics is lower
than non-synthetic, so the concern was that the synthetic might not cool the
internals as well.  There were also a lot of responses that said they used synth
and didn't see any real change in operating temps.  Another line on the synth
was that it should still be changed as much or nearly as much as non-synth to
remove all the combustion products that build up in the oil.

I run 20W-50 non-synth, but would feel comfortable with either straight 30 or 40
wieght, except that 30 is too light for the over-the-hill driving I do in the
California heat, and 40 is too heavy for the coast-side driving I do on
weekends.  I do feel that the 20W-50 breaks down faster than the straight
weights as evidenced by the fact that is turns dark faster.  The earlier
breakdown is probably the additives that are put in to make it a multi-vis, so
my rule is to start thinking about changing oil shortly after it turns black
(only about 2000 miles).  In the winter, I run straight 30 and let it warm up
well on the cold mornings.

Just my $.02 worth,
terry
