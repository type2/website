Subject: Re: Mark Stephens High Performance - cores

Stephen,

Mark Stephens has a rep of being very tight on cores and I am considering,
as part of this new engine, whether or not to bother sending them one.
Their engine core charge is $400, so just writing it off and keeping the
old case for a spare time rebuild is definitely an option.  Figure $100+
for shipping, -$200 for deductions (if I'm lucky, the core I am
considering sending is *definitely* dead) which means I net at most $100. 
Not chump change, but a vanagon block is worth more than that, not to
mention the crank and extras. 

What a company charges for cores and how likely they are to return the
core charges is a definite issue.  Norm at Mark Stephens was very up-front
about their core policies, so I am not complaining, just wary.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
