Subject: Re: [T2] eurovan rear brakes


&gt;
&gt;has anyone done brakes on a 1997 eurovan. I was trying to do them on my 
&gt;moms
&gt;but couldn;t get the caliper to compress with a c clamp. Any ideas, thanks
&gt;dylan,

Dylan,
   If the Eurovan's rear brakes are like other late model V-Dubs, you need a 
caliper tool that allows you to screw the piston back into its bore.  There 
are two opposing notches in the piston where the tool fits.  KD tools, 
Craftsman, etc. all make this tool.


   Eron
