&gt; The palm-sized U-shaped steel doo-dad--bentley calls 
&gt; it the &quot;link&quot;--on my sliding door is cracked straight
&gt; thru making the door hang up. (I'm talking about that
&gt; metal U, the thickness of your index finger, that the
&gt; door hangs from on the center track.)
&gt; 
&gt; Before I go to the yard and buy an entire door (and
&gt; have to get a friend to help me tear it off), does
&gt; someone on the list have one hanging around? I'd pay
&gt; shipping and fair price.
