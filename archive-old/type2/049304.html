stevo sends:

&gt; listees! i am considering buying a bay where the owner can't find the title
&gt; and never filed for a replacement. owner and bus are in california. is
&gt; there a way around this, like a duplicate title that can be picked up in
&gt; one day at the dmv? i am trying to prevent a case of the sketchies, and
&gt; being able to get a clean slip in oregon as easily as usual. is going
&gt; through sacto essential? any ideas on a process that has worked are
&gt; welcome. thanks,

It will be *far* easier if the current owner gets the replacement title.
