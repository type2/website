Subject: And the Answer Is...Ignition Coil!

Good Afternoon Everyone!
        Well, if you have read Sean's trip report from Everybus, you know of 
the problems my '77 Westy &quot;Alice Cooper&quot; gave us on the way down. Sean 
covered the details very well. We took off from Everybus Sunday morning and 
for the first 20 miles she was running well. Then it started again, the 
cutting out at high RPM. It was not nearly as bad as on the way down, so we 
kept going. Bob and Nancy Busick were following us in case &quot;Alice&quot; died 
completely. In Lynchburg we stopped at McDonalds for lunch, and I mentioned 
to Bob if we passed an open auto parts store I wanted to pick up a coil. 
About 1/2 mile later we found an open Autozone, so we stopped in and I picked 
up an &quot;off-brand&quot; coil-hey it's southern Virginia on a Sunday afternoon- ya 
takes what they got. Another customer in the Autozone store was about to get 
violent over an employee screwing up his Ford T-Bird, so we paid for the coil 
and ran. We went on to my in-laws house in Gordonsville, VA. and spent Sunday 
night there (part of the plan anyway) This morning I put on the new coil, and 
&quot;Alice&quot; purred like a kitten the whole way home, 90 miles. No cutting out, 
great power. I looked down at one point and I was doing 70! I'll post more of 
the story on my web page later in the week, plus the pictures I took at 
Everybus, which, by the way, was great. I can't thank everyone enough for the 
help in trying to find the problem. I've said it before, I'll say it again: 
VW folks are the best!!         Jeff S.
