Subject: Re: Oil Weight

This is a subject that could go on forever!! just like VW vans!! It Does
depend on where you Live and the Temperature that you drive your bus in
and size of Motor--Here in Phoenix,  home of 8 months of hell and 4
months of &quot;Winter&quot;?  I stay with Castrol 20/50 during our &quot;Winter&quot;.
But when we reach &quot;Simmer&quot; AKA summer, i move more to straight weight
oil--40w and even 50w in the 63 Hearse--Years ago VW said NO to multi
weight oils--BUT times have changed and the multi grades are much
better--But again with the high temps of a VW motor in 100+ degree
heat--straight weight oil is helpfull--I know A Lot of you out there and
even in Phoenix will stay with a lighter weight--But again for me
heavier than normal works! I drive my VWs during the day,  so i feel
more comfortable with 50w--
I have changed oil in summer at 110+ degrees after driving my VW and
that 50w oil and it comes out like water!-- Mileage on my VW motors
are--60,000+ on the 67 bus--65,000+ on the 62--57,000+ on the 71--&amp; just
3000 on the VW factory in Germany rebuild on the Hearse--they all seem
to &quot;Like&quot; the straight weights. Again this works for me--you have to
decide for yourself--when in doubt--go thicker!
