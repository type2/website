Ok..nobody wanted the camper..so I picked up a parts bus for the sliding door
and like that..I will have most of a 79 bus left over when I'm done swapping
parts:
what appears to be a good engine with a *BRAND NEW*  2bbl weber on it and
assorted other bus stuff  Somebody in the Raliegh NC area could make out well
here..like buy the carb and get the engine and the rest of the bus for free?
pick what you want and leave enough wheels for me to tow it away? Tools,
torches and air compresser here to use.....)
think about it..make offer...!
