Is the donor bus a sunroof bus as well?  if so, good luck!!!:)  

I would start by getting a few spots (after it is hung by the bows) along
the front endge of the sunroof tacked in place, then go the front of the
bus, line th holes for the sunvisors up, such as that.  then start working
toward the rear, keeping an eye on the sunroof area.  you can take up
slack in the sunroof hole, but you CANNOT makeup for something that is to
short!

(i remembered something that needed to go here, while typing the below,
but i've forgotten it...mm)

If you are starting with a non-sunroof donor, the project might be easier.

See how the headliner hangs in the sunroof bus, particularly along the
sides of the sunroof pan.  I suspect it has no bows in this area.  along
the rear half of the sunroof pan, it may have some odd bows.  I'm unsure.
never worked on a sunroof bus..)

The headliner is secured around the sunroof opening, i suspect, buy a
simple pinchwelt molding.   Under this molding the vinyl is glued and
wrapped around a metal ledge.  

Behind the sunroof opening, where the rear half of the pan lay, you may
find that the &quot;new&quot; headliner will not ride quite the same as befoer,
since it cannot go up into the curve of the roof.   this willlikely give
you extra material in the window frame areas (and possibly make lining up
pull-handles awkward)

Anyway.  To install the nonsunroof headliner inthe sunroof bus, pretty
much follow johns excellent instructions.   Ignore the sunroof opening
itself for now.  perhaps also ignore the sides of the headliner
(window/door areas) until you have the front and rear attached.

You do not want a lot of tension on the now-floating area under the
sunroof opening, but you do not want a whle lot of extra material, either.

Press upwards aalong the edges of the sunroof opening, with the material,
to see how the rest of the headliner will react.  you want to get the
sides (door/window) attached now, but you need to see how much material to
give.  Play with it a bit, to see what it will take to get it just right.

Now, get yoursel fsome razor blades.single edge, of course!  probably on a
small ladder, look down into the sunroof opening take the razor blade (you
may need a few before you are done...they are the best thing to use to do
any trimming with) and make an X across the opeing.  stay, at this point,
at least 6-8 inches away from the actual edges of the opening!!  

crawl back inside, careful of the blade, and stand up through the sunroof
opening.  Be very careful of the material, particularly in the area of the
now-cut seams, and at the &quot;ends&quot; of the X that you made.  being to pull
the material into the opening, taking up any tslack you my need to out of
the rest of the headliner.  do not tack yet, just pull, and judge how
things react.  Watch the corner,s particularly, as they can be tricky to
do without wrinkles.

once you really see and understand what is going on as you pull things, go
in and cut a &quot;circle&quot; out, a square, really, staying 3-4 inches in from
the edge of the sunroof.  go a tad wide (ie, leave more material,) in the
corner areas.  pull and look some more.

Now apply your glue.  Once the glue is ready,tack your front corners, then
grasp the middle of the front and pull backand in, and get it seated,
hopefully giving you a wrinkle free front edge...of not, pull it off while
you still can, and do it again.;)

I always start at the pull those door/window sides nw, and tack them
Oh, you want to glue just the edge of the lip, not all down and on and
around the pan.  Just the underside and topside where the pinchewelt
covers.  Be a bit more liberal on the material side, going 1-2 inches in
maybe.  Whatever you need fro the particular area.

Do no fold the material over yet! Just get it tacked un the underside.
Be very careful of the cut-seams, as they WILL want to unravel.   no go
and tack the rear coners, and turn to the sides.  Does the side look like
it will pull up wrinkle free?  good.  check that the rear does too!  If it
all looks like it will work out, tack the sides, then the rear.  Check it
out.  No wringkles, to-tight areas, no-loose areas, etc? good!

now take your thumb and run along that underside of the lip to be sure it
is held fast.  then work your thumb up a bit, to the edge of the ip, and
work your way around.you want to slowly roll the material over the edge.

now you nmeed to look at those corners.  you need to make cuts to let the
material do its thing but the cuts need to be done the proper way, else
you'll end up with problems downt he road.   Did you notice the way the
factory headliner was done in this area?  (do so!)

bascially you want to make a few cuts, spread evenly over the curve of the
corner. when you fold the material over, these cuts will pen up, fan like,
and lay down.  if you cut to far, the cut will work its way around
thelip, and you dont want that!!

Ok, i am very much failing at coming up with a working description of
these cuts. :(   If you look at the factory cuts, you will see what i
mean.


anyway,  now (probably before these cuts, actually) figure out how far the
material needs to go around the lip.  it may be 1/4 inch, may be 1/2, may
be 1!!  start on one edge, possibly a side, and cut, giving yourself ~1/2
inch more material then you neeed.  no need to go all the way around at
this point, just do one corner and half of a side to get a working feel.
now make those cuts we were talking about in the corner you just cut.
Now slide your finger along this area, working it up and over very
carefully.  it willl stand straight up first, then come back and work it
over the edge, laying it down.  make sense?  good.;)

now do that the rest of the way around.._dot_come back and trim off once again
the extra material that the pinchwelt will not cover, and reinstall the
pinchwelt.  you may need/want to slightly squeeze this a bit tighter...i
dont know.

any more questions, ask.

Oh.  the cover on the sunroof itself?  see bentley for e removal...but
unless the bus you found for a donar has a good one (ie, a sunroof bus)
you will have to make your own.  should be fairly simple, and you may have
enough good material on your ol headliner to do it, else get another from
a junker.  (or spend the what,? 125, 150 bnucks and get a new kit for the
bus...but i digress...)

and please excuase the multidude of typos, the lag is up tremendously
today...:(
