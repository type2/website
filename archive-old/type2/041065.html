Subject: Steering box help in PA

Hi Volks,

The steering box on my '70 westy is shot and I have another to replace
it.  Any tips on how to do it?  I am not about to spend the $100-150 I
was quoted.  I guess my biggest obstacle is getting the drag link off.
Any suggestions?  Anyone done this before in Philly area and would like
to help?  Thanks
