Subject: [T2] storage ?

Gentlepersons-
                       Picked up a good used trans over the weekend. Plenty 
of room in my 
basement (warm and dry), other than that, any tips on (hopefully), long term 
storage?
i.e. don't leave it on concrete so the synchros won't leak their 
synchronicity...
