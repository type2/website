Subject: 78 Over head AC unit

Hi all,

 

I have a 78 overhead AC unit still for sale, its very complete.  Everything
from the compressor to the head unit.  It's the &quot;H&quot; style over head.  The
previous owner stated that it worked great when he parked it last.

 

Anyone interested?

 

David.
