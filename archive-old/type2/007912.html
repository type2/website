Subject: An effort to clear up some questions regarding buying bus tires

Lately, there has been some misinformation and guesswork posted to the list
regarding tires for 1968-1979 Type 2 busses.

Here are the specifications for the original equipment radial tires (earlier
buses had bias ply OE tires):**

           LOAD   OUTSIDE   SECTION    RIM       REVS
  SIZE     RANGE  DIAMETER   WIDTH    WIDTH    PER MILE    MAXIMUM LOAD
--------   -----  --------  -------  --------  --------  ----------------
185R14RF*   SL     25.6&quot;     7.4&quot;    4.5-6.0&quot;    816     1477 lbs _at_42 psi

  NOTE: This is not a load range C or D tire, this is a reinforced
        standard load tire which allows for higher inflation pressures
        and therefore higher maximum loads.  Many VW and Audi automobiles
        require RF tires, not just buses.

In contrast, Dunlop offers a couple of load range C and D tires in this same
size:

        LOAD   OUTSIDE   SECTION    RIM       REVS
  SIZE  RANGE  DIAMETER   WIDTH    WIDTH    PER MILE    MAXIMUM LOAD
------  -----  --------  -------  --------  --------  ---------------
185R14    C     25.7&quot;     7.4&quot;    4.5-6.0&quot;    811     1600 lbs _at_ 50 psi
185R14    D     25.7&quot;     7.4&quot;    4.5-6.0&quot;    811     1855 lbs _at_ 50 psi

I hope that this helps clear things up a little bit and make it a little easier
to buy new tires.

Is anyone interested in my creating a web page covering this and other issues
regarding bus tires?
