Subject: Order New Bus Tents  with Credit Cards

Just a reminder that I import new German Bus tents (Busvorzelt in German)

Now that camping season is starting, I thought I would point you to my web 
site at www.eurocampers_dot_com

I have the Casa Royal and the Nizza bus tents in stock, and I now accept 
credit cards.

The new German tents are similar to the old Westy tents, but have a few new 
features.  They work great with any VW Bus of any year.

I also have plenty of Reimo German Camper accessory catalogs available for 
$10 including shipping.

Also check out my awnings pages.  This is a nice awning setup using quality 
materials.

Sorry I will miss you all at the campout this weekend.  I hope to do a few 
events this spring and summer, so maybe we'll see you at another camping 
event soon.
