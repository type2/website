Don't forget to clean the ground contacts for both the battery to body AND
trans to body.  The latter cost me several hours and a new starter before I
figured it out.  The time was well spent because it taught me a good lesson.
I ended up keeping the starter too since I didn't know the history of the
old one.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a 72 bus and the power all works in it put when I turn the key
&gt; &gt; the final turn to start it nothing happens.  I think its an electrical
&gt; &gt; problem. It's a fairly new starter (6 months old) so I don't think its
&gt; &gt; that.  Is there a main wire that I should check? Or anthing else that
&gt; &gt; could be doing this?
&gt; 
&gt; Other wires to check include:
&gt; battery terminals
&gt; the big cable from positive battery terminal to the starter (both ends)
&gt; wires to and from the starter relay
&gt; ignition switch and that long wire from it to the starter relay
&gt;
