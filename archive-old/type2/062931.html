Subject: Who's going to Jerome?

I'm seriously considering the Jerome trip.  There's a Splitty club out here
that's going to caravan out and I may join along.  Can anyone tell me if
there's anything to be aware of for this trip?  Is it a bare bones camp site
set up?  Any showers?  Restrooms?  Can anyone out there expound on what we're
in for?  Other list members may be considering.
