&gt; Since 1600s were put into all Mexican and Brazilian buses until they
&gt; went to watercooling I'd venture to say that the engine will give good
&gt; service in a typ 2.  They are undoubtedly better than the &quot;crate&quot;
&gt; 
As far as I know, Mexican Buses did indeed go to water-cooling but the
Brazilian Buses still use the upright 1600 air-cooled engine, as do the
Mexican Beetles.
