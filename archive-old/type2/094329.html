Subject: Exhaust loudness

It's been a long time since I owned a Beetle and I'm lucky if I see another
bus on the road in a given week so I'm still getting used to the sounds VWs
make.

It seems to me that a large amount of the operating &quot;noise&quot; is coming from
the exhaust, not the engine itself.  I drove around the block with the
sliding door locked open the other day and I could really hear the exhaust
over the engine.

My exhaust is new, and I've checked for leaks as part of a maintenance check
but compared to modern cars with their silent exhaust systems I'm wondering
if there is anything bolt-on that will make what I have quieter.  I have the
all-in-one eliminator style with the EGR port sealed off.
