Subject: RE: [T2] Type 4 motor, engine stand question...

One more note about pricing on the engine stand. The price online was 
cheaper than the store. The cashier said it was usually the case. She asked 
if it was cheaper I said yes and gave her the wrong amount mistakingly. It 
listed as $39.99 online, $44.99 in the store. I told her $29.99 as I was 
digging out the sheet I printed from the online catalog. She entered $29.99 
and I showed her the paper and said oops my mistake. She told me it was my 
lucky day and she wasn't changing it.

The point is although I did not try to pull a fast one and saved a few bucks 
it helps to have the paperwork when you go in.

Later,
