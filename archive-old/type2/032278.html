Okay, what about all of us poor slobs with progressive setups? It seems
that one of the main drawbacks of the progressive is the lack of vaccum
ports.  Where would be a good place to put the tap for the booster hose on
this particular setup's manifold... or does it matter?  IIRC, fluid
dynamics tells us that closed system pressure (or vaccum) is uniform
throughout the fluid system.  When there's vaccum happening, the system
should be closed.

Also, could the manifold be tapped to hook up a vaccum advance for a
dizzy?  Everything I've read says that if you use a progressive, you're
cursed with the 009. Where'd be a good place for that kinda vaccum tap?
