Subject: Stock &quot;TypeII First Aid Kit?&quot;

I found it in my grandpa's bus today ('70 pop top ASI/Riviera).  Typical 
sized first aid kit, metal with red trim/writing.  Old (not newer look).  
Open it up, it has rows of skinny boxes on their sides with a booklet of 
instructions laying flat on top.  The adhesive label on the inside of the 
lid has &quot;Type II First Aid Kit.&quot;  Is that just a coinkidink??  I know my 
grandpa's original receipt has &quot;Kamper Kit&quot; written on it (separate price), 
and the tent is also separate from that, as is the pop top, I believe.  
Maybe the first aid kit was part of the &quot;kamper kit?!&quot;
