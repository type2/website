Justin,
You should check the archives, under starter bushing.  A 1/2&quot; tap works
best.  Or what I have done,  is to step outside the square,  and replace the
starter with a *Bosch, supported type* eliminating the need for a bushing at
all.

Bob,  Who's loading up, and heading for some (Free Bus) winter camping in
Baja........

&gt;
&gt; I know!!!!  Is winter the season that pseudo bus lovers dump their beloved
&gt; bay windows?  I have noticed in my local paper nice splits and bays for
&gt; really cheap.  I think when it gets cold, most people do not want to go
&gt; camping (or wrench on a project for that matter).  Anyway, I saw a very
&gt; decent split window for $1000 which is unheard of out here in San Diego.
&gt;
&gt; Bus Content:
&gt;
&gt; I replaced my starter last night.  Very easy job except for the obligatory
&gt; arc welding job when I tighten the negative battery terminal and slightly
&gt; touch the positive side with the open end wrench (I need to stop doing
this
&gt; : ) ).  Anyway, when I removed the old starter, I could not get the old
&gt; bushing out of the trans.  I tried to use a bolt, a screwdriver and my
pinky
&gt; but no luck.  It didn't look all that bad so I just threw in the new
starter
&gt; with the old bushing.  Any thoughts?  Comments?  It felt good to drive my
&gt; bus to work again.  One of the chief reasons I got into buses was that
they
&gt; are slow or &quot;speed challenged&quot; and I have 8 speeding tickets on my record
&gt; (don't ask).  But after the purchase of my first westy it has become a
&gt; lifestyle.  Alright, I just had to share my rekindled joy of my bus : )

&gt; There are a lot of good deals out there if you look, I had a 68 Dormobile
&gt; for sale on the net for over 2 months for $2500.00 dollars, this was a
&gt; mechanically sound, rust free, complete Dormie, that could have been
driven
&gt; anywhere, all it needed was some cosmetics (camper interior) and someone
&gt; would of had a nice Dormie, it is finally gone to the first person who
&gt; looked at it in person and they thanked me for letting them steal it for
the
&gt; 2500 they paid for it.

&gt;
&gt; From what I've seen in recent years baywindow buses have definitely turned
&gt; the corner on pricing and are headed back up.  This was really obvious at
&gt; OktoBugFest [Puyallup, WA fairgrounds] last weekend.
&gt;
&gt; There were several Bays for sale there, and even truly ratty and trashed
&gt; rigs were priced at least twice what they'd have been asking [and getting]
a
&gt; year or so ago.
&gt;
&gt; One '71 Westfalia that was partially &quot;restored&quot; with a so-so paint job and
a
&gt; recent engine rebuild was priced at $5,800.  The camper interior was
&gt; incomplete, the upholstery was ragged and torn, and the only clean and
shiny
&gt; part was the newish paint.  There was no shortage of interested customers,
&gt; and not a peep about the price.
&gt;
&gt; A friend chose not to put his '69 European-spec Westy for sale at Puyallup
&gt; because he thought it was too beat and tired to attract interest.  In
fact,
&gt; there were plenty of early bay buses for sale there in far worse
condition.
&gt; The cheapest I saw was a gutted and rusted out '68 or '69, with mismatched

&gt; and worn out tires and hacked holes everywhere that was priced at $2,900.
&gt;
&gt; It won't be long before parts vendors pick up on this trend, and we'll
find
&gt; ourselves in the same boat as the splitty owners.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW.....

&gt; &gt;&gt;  My feeling is the Internet is helping to push prices up. You can still
&gt; get one for a decent price, but not
&gt; from someone on the net!  &lt;&lt;
