find any reference to it being an automatic, so I will
assume a stick. I will also assume that the noise
(whine) came along recently and got worse rather
quickly. You say it shifts better now, meaning that it
shifted worse for a while and since you didn't say it
shifts perfectly now, I assume it still does not shift
as well as it did before you started hearing the
whine. 
   
  i didnt realize when we bought it that it had this whiine to it.. so i cant say that it wasnt here before... but it is now....!
  yes its a manual trans...
  it shifts better nwo that i have put new trans fluid in there and got the old out... thats what i meant by better...
  

That's a whole lot of assuming that really should have
been included in the query, BTW!
   
  thanks for that note also...i will try to do better ;)

If all my assumptions are correct, I think you need to
replace the front shift rod bushing that is directly
under the shift lever and is reached from underneath
by removing the &quot;skid pan.&quot; If you're mechanically
inclined, it's not a bad job to replace yourself. That
is, to replace the bushing yourself. Otherwise, see
yer mechanic!
   
  yes i gotta replace this for her and it will shift alot better then as it did on my bus when i replaced it on mine... i dont think that this will cause the bad whine i am hearing though,.,, 

Of course, if it is an automatic and or any other
assumptions are wrong, it could be something in the
engine compartment, but I still stand by my
assumptions! -BaH
   
  you know what they say about assumptions dont you... LOL...
