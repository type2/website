Subject: Highway cruising...

FWIW -

I do all of my highway/freeway cruising in the lane to the left of the &quot;slow
lane&quot; for various reasons:

1)    The semi's are usually in the &quot;slow lane&quot;, which causes that lane to
undergo more wear and tear, thus usually a much rougher ride.

2)    The semi's can pass without having to change lanes.

3)    The merging/exiting traffic becomes of little concern to me, as far as
merging or getting in the way of the off-rampers. Just hold 60 mph, Mr.
Checkov.

4)    If two semi's are bearing down on me abreast, I can always move left
one more lane to get out of both of their ways, a maneuver which has
prompted the friendly &quot;blinking of the lights&quot; from the gratuitous
professionals in their mobile offices.

5)    It affords the cars in the #1 and #2 (and #3) lanes just a little
closer look of Itch. I'm sure they appreciate that on their hurried ways to
work or play.

The freeways I drive are usually 4 or more traffic lanes, so I still leave
at least 2 unhindered lanes to my left. YH(ighway)MV, but the extra
smoothness of the &quot;lane to the left&quot; is very noticeable to Me &amp; Itch.

&gt; Highway cruising is at 55-60 MPH, and city driving at a very safe
&gt; acceleration rate way over in the slow lane with my eyes continuously
&gt; scanning for death ray emissions from those great American land pig SUV
&gt; things out there on the tarmac driven with a lipstick wand in one hand
&gt; and a cell phone in the other.
&gt;
&gt; Billy Bob Pickup Lane Changer with his Lone Star nestled down beneath
&gt; the eyes of revenue collector cops stays way over in the far left lane,
&gt; so he has no impact on my mileage being varied from life saving braking
&gt; actions.
