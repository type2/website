Subject: Re: [T2] Conserving gas in a camper

&amp;lt;How in the world is one supposed to know what's domestic and what's not? Most ot the Japanese carmakers build at least some of their cars here in US. And &amp;quot;American&amp;quot; cars are built in Canada, Mexico, central and South America. 20 years ago my Mom bought a Pontiac cuz she wanted to Support American workers. Some time later she found out that it was actully assembeld somewhere in South America.&amp;gt;

I totally understand. Once upon a time I told my Dad his Chevy S-10 was the samr thing as an Iszuzu Hombre. He didn't believe me but admitted I was right after he saw a few. He's a good gearhead - I figured he'd know that! &amp;lt;griN!&amp;gt; He used to rag me about my imports but like you said - what's an import anymore? 

My &amp;quot;German&amp;quot; VW Cabrio was built in Mexico, so was his &amp;quot;American&amp;quot; Chevy truck as far as I know... &amp;lt;grin!&amp;gt; His Japanese Honda Goldwing and our former Japanese Honda Accord were built in Ohio I think... 

We recently did a project here at work for Harley-Davidson... The gas tank was made in Taiwan!!! Tell that to some biker dude and see if he doesn't choke on his Wheaties... Hopefully he doesn't get ugly about it... FWIW I hear alot of the current Harley's are made from overseas components... I better not hear any snide comments about my import motorycles from Harley dudes anymore...
