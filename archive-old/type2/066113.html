Subject: '71 trans problem - stuck in gear

Hey Volks!

Here's my problem --

Last night I met Maggie at an event where she was a speaker. It was at the Rio 
Hotel. I pulled my van in to the valet, got my ticket and went in. About 4 
hours later when I picked up the van the attendant says, with a sheepish grin, 
&quot;I couldn't get it out of first gear...&quot; Having messed with the shifter and 
knowing that if it's not adjusted right it can act pretty odd I pulled out and 
into a parking lot to check that expecting loose bolts. But as I pulled out 
the lever will _not_ move and it feels very strange. The reverse lock-out 
doesn't push down with the right feeling. And the bolts were tight and the 
shifter, when removed and put back in was OK. So, I went back to try to find 
someone who had a clue what happened --  but no one did. It was about 12:30 
when I finally got the van and me home courtesy of AAA.

I haven't had an opportunity to look at anything yet but thought I'd query the 
list to see if this stuck in gear trick has happened to anyone else and if so, 
what it was that they found wrong. What should I be looking for? What's the 
worst case? I've been through the linkage (replaced bushings where I could - 
7-8 months ago) and just can't visualize where that might bind.

Thanks,

- -Scott
