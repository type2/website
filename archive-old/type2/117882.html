Subject: Re: [T2] The Physics of Cooling

You are forgetting about load... the engine will generate more heat at a
given RPM under load.  That is why you pull over and idle (or rev a
little) when you overheat - more RPM and less load = more cooling.

&gt; Why isn't temp a relative constant?  With increased RPM, the fan
&gt; would most certainly be turning faster, and the engine would be
&gt; enjoying a greater amount of cooling air, but would not the
&gt; engine also be creating equivalently MORE heat to be dissipated
&gt; (increased RPM = increased combustion).
