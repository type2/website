Subject: Fuel Pressure problems continue

Recently my '76 FI van starts slowly when cold.  It was hypothesized that
this was due to a slow buildup of fuel pressure, not from the engine being
warm.
Mainly this was from the fact that once I get the engine going in the
morning, I can immediately shut it off, and it will start right up.

So Bill Crick wrote:
&quot;Jesse: With my limited knowledge, I've vote for the check valve in the fuel
pump. Try removing the cold start valve, and opening it with 12v. Try
right after van was started. It should spray for a short time due to
pressure in the lines. Repeat after standing for a while. If the pressure is
gone, then it won't squirt. Also note, your fuel pressure regulator could
have a small leak, or dirt in it so it bleeds off the pressure slowly when
the van isn't running.&quot;

I think I tried something like that today.  My train of logic was that
when I run the van in the morning for 3 seconds, fuel pressure builds up,
but the engine does not warm.  Thus, it is fuel pressure.  But I thought
I should try the other route.  So I drove home with the engine all warm.
I killed the engine, and planned to immediatel elease fuel pressure by
opening the fuel pressure gauge hookup.  (Was this a very unsafe thing to
do?  I had a rag over it....)  Anyway, I expected a bold squirt of 35 psi
fuel, but just a dribble came out.  Did I lose my fuel pressure in 10
seconds?  This seems contradictory.  Anyway, I own a fuel pressure gauge
but it was at my mother's house, and she is mailing it.  Soon we will
know.  It is a cheap brand, I hope that is OK.  If anyone has had problem
with cheap fuel pressure gauges, let me know.

Thanks
Jesse
