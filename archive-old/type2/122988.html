Subject: RE: [T2] My Brakes is broke - Cracked linings on shoes

&gt;&gt;Inside the drum things looked OK but the linings on both shoes are
deeply cracked. Is this normal?&lt;&lt;

no. replace them asap.

&gt;&gt;I
also need to replace one adjuster star, as I broke a couple teeth off
getting it apart. Note to self: Must get more anti-seize.&lt;&lt;

you can also use 'white lithium grease' which is made specifically for this
application. i'm sure anit-seize would work tho.

&gt;&gt;Just a few more details to attend to and everything will be peachy for
the trip to EveryBus.&lt;&lt;

see you there!
