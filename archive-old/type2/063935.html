Subject: Re: Propane heaters, suggestion.

&gt; I'm probably going to go
&gt; for the 3100A, it's small, completely safe, and needs no venting since it
&gt; works on a catalytic process.

In the colder climates these catalytic heaters are pretty much useless, since 
they pump out a tremendous amount of water vapor, which has the nasty habit of 
condensing on the inside of the windows (kind of takes you back to when you were
dating, doesn't it?).  Also you still have to provide venting if you plan to 
sleep with one of these going, since they can use up your O2 in a hurry.  I 
tried one in my beetle on the frozen plains and it frosted up the inside pronto.
