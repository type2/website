It has to be in a reasonable state of configuration in order to begin: distributor oriented correctly, plug wires in the correct order, plugs gapped, coil wired up correctly, fuel delivery, no major vacuum leaks, etc.

&gt;once running i can set the valves and then go back and sreset the timing again...
&gt;
&gt;the timing is still pretty far off... is that not going to hurt the valves..?

You are setting the timing of the spark, not the timing of the valves to piston position if that's what you are thinking. If the timing is too retarded it will run rough or not at all. If it's way too advanced then there is a chance of pre-detonation which could damage the piston crown or get the valves too hot. Realistically, at idle, there's not much chance of that kind of damage as you are making your adjustments.

The steps are:

- adjust valve clearances
- adjust dwell to 50 degrees (if you have points)
- run motor and set timing to spec
- adjust idle rpm to spec
