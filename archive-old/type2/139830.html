&gt; &gt; &gt; okso maybe this is a silly question but if i wanted to add a toggle
&gt; &gt; &gt; switch to my starting battery how would i do so?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Access Systems&quot; &lt;accessys_at_smart_dot_net&gt;
&gt; &gt; the good news is that it isn't hard at all.  I have one in my bus.
&gt; &gt; the bad news is that this has to be a rather substantial switch since it
&gt; &gt; is carrying ALL the power in the bus (or it needs to be a substantial
&gt; &gt; relay)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You could have a really nice set up like the drag racers &lt;and RV owners&gt; use,,
&gt; they mount the battery in the trunk, and put a switch in the rear valence of the
&gt; car, if the car needs to be shut down a race official can run up and turn the
&gt; car &quot;off&quot;
&gt;
&gt;  you could do the same with the switch as your battery is already in the rear of
&gt; the car... just put the switch beside the rear tail light.

you wouldn't want to do that with a later model bus with an alternator.
in fact if you get a switch make ABSOLUTELY SURE YOU NEVER TURN IT OFF
WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING. it will probably kill your voltage regulator.

part of the reason mine was so expensive is that it is a &quot;make before
break switch&quot;
