Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 CDN worth

Hi Alan,

If it's mechanically sound and safety certified, you might get $1200  
to $2500 with a tremclad paint job on it, depending on the time of  
year and market conditions.

Think about your family growing up with the bus. Mine has. We have a  
family of five and the westfakia suits us fine. All you need to do is  
swap the 78 interior for a 1974-75 interior with the full-width rear  
bed or do some modifications.

It's cheaper to invest in the upkeep on a bus than it is to make  
payments on a new car. $400/month spent on a bus will quickly bring  
it up to excellent running order, and in the second year it will be  
time for proper bodywork and paint. Think of all the upgrades that  
$400 could bring -- Heated seats, propane furnace, killer tunes,  
sweet alloy rims and proper tires, etc, etc. The third year you can  
save up for the RABY/Boston Bob engine upgrade, and so on and so forth.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
