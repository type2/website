&gt;Thanks again. I am quite pleased to feel a part of such a kind and devoted
group
&gt;of people brought together by the common love of a vehicle.


Merry Christmas, Ian.  My bus is in the garage, too.  I miss driving it,
especially with all the snow around here right now (better ground clearance
than anything else I've got.  We don't need no steekin' heat...).   There
will be days when you wonder what mass hypnosis convinced you to pass up a
perfectly serviceable, warm car in lieu of a symbol of something you may not
even be able to explain.  But as you look for the words, notice you keep
smiling while you do.  That Escort might have made you do that, but I doubt
it.  Keep asking for help when you need it.  One of the listees calmed a
panicy owner down, reminding him &quot;It's only a machine.&quot;

It's just not like any other machine.
