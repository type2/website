Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Tailgaters

it's funny when I'm on the freeway and someone zooms up behind me sniffing 
the tailpipe, then waits for me to speed up, eventually realises that I'm going 
to stay at 60mph, and after tapping their fingers impatiently for a while 
notices the empty lanes to the left, and zips around and sniffs the next cars 
tailpipe.    

If someone hangs on the tailpipe for more than a couple of seconds, I usually 
tap the brakes just enough to make the lights flash.  This is generally on 
the rural roads around here, where you can't pass everywhere, if someone does 
pass I catch up at the next stopsign, and I don't need to go 70 in a 40mph zone. 
  Usually they realise what's up and back off or go around.  

 I think something about seeing buses makes other drivers act wierd.   Do 
other people get strangers in minivans yelling &quot;Woodstock!&quot; or stuff like that at 
you?   

them: &quot;Hey, man, it's 1969!  Wow, man!&quot;

me: &quot;No, the bus is a FIFTY-nine, and this year now is nineteen EIGHTY-nine.&quot;

them: ramble ramble

me:  im' gone
