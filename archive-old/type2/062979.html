Subject: seat restuffing

hey sean/everyone,

i wouldn't get new seats unless the covers are in poor shape or unless you
got money to burn. my girlfriend's mom restuffed my front passenger seat in
about 15 minutes. it's like brand new now. save your money. just take the
seat out. you notice on the bottom the covers are held on with metal wire..
take these off with some needle nose pliers and save. then stuff as much
regular chair stuffing stuff (redundant stuff huh?) as you can making sure
it's even. then reclip the wires and put the seat in. pretty simple huh?
my original seats had horse hair as stuffing. kinda kewl. anyway, this was
done on a '74 van. worked for me....should work for you i reckon'. usual
disclaims and all that. but really, that seat is much more comfortable now.

take care,

jonathan '74 retrowestie
