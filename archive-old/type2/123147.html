&gt; I am stranded in Waltersboro, SC. My tranny has leaked all of its fluid. The 

unfortunately a bit too far for me to run down and give a hand, but

&gt; bus felt almost like it was stuck in neutral. So we pulled over. Tranny 
&gt; fluid smokin off the engine. Looked underneath and watched a stream of 
&gt; tranny fluid pour out from the bottom of the final drive from behind the 
&gt; torque converter.
&gt; 
&gt; Tried adding fluid and it didn't drain, but as soon as I started the bus I 
&gt; could watch it pour out.  Now if I start the bus there is a loud crunching 
&gt; noise that immediately starts. So I don't start the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I figure the converter seal is probably bad. Maybe the converter bushing 

for sure the seal is blown, not expensive and get two, they are easy to
damage,  bus depot had em last I checked

&gt; went bad and caused the seal to go bad. Could that cause the noise?

without fluid a noise is almost inevitable, but you won't know until seal
is repaired.  lousy way to find out if you have to drop the engine a
second time
&gt; 
&gt; I really need any help? Never dropped an engine. Not sure what special tools 

a good tool box and a good jack is about all the special tools you need.
it is definately a two person job if you haven't done it before.
I pull only the engine, because it is lighter and less likely to damage
the shift linkages.  others pull engine and tranny together 

&gt; I need. Very low on $.

having a spare tranny would be the best bet.

&gt; Willing to try anything. Found access to parts, but no address to ship them 
&gt; to.
&gt; Need place to work on bus. Any help or advice is much appreciatted.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a 79 w/ an auto tranny.

any 75-79 auto tranny will work

Good luck as you get closer to deciding what to do I will throw you the
specific tips for that repair

maybe a tow somewhere might be your best choice
