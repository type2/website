&gt; You did undo the screws from underneath the car, right?  That always

Yuppers, those were the buggers that got me the first time I tried to
remove the firewall.  :)


&gt; Make sure that's fuel rated hose!  You don't want it deteriorating on 
&gt; you.  I used FI hose with fresh clamps just to be safe.  Also, don't 
&gt; forget to get the hose on the left side of the engine bay.  You might 
&gt; also have one by your computer on the right side, but I don't remember 
&gt; seeing one there.  Check Richard's site because he's got pix of all the 
&gt; hose connections.  Replace them all while you're at it.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Yeah, I had hose left over from when I replaced the fuel return line on
my diesel truck.  Richard's site is the one that helped me find the
hidden on by the (former) spare tire well.  In all I think I replaced 8
pieces of hose.  4 by the tank, 1 by the tire well, 3 by rear access
door.  I felt all along the vapor hard lines and replaced any rubber I
found.


&gt; Your sender is probably dying.  Heck, fix that while you've got the 
&gt; firewall off.
&gt; 

Doh, too late for that!  It's already back in place.  Not a big deal,
though.  I'll just go by mileage or keep it more than half full.  ;)

Thanks for the info!
