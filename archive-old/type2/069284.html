A couple of things worried me in David's post about his friends oil
cooler setup.

1.  blocking the doghouse oil cooler with a rag - I susspect this means
    blocking the outlet above #3 cylinder. Putting anything in the fan
    inlet is just asking for expensive trouble. A rag dangling down on
    to #3 output manifold might not be a good idea either.

2.  A non-full flow cooler with a take off at the pressure sender would
    seem to be a bad idea. The pressure sender will measure the sum of 
    the pressures to both systems the oil pressure at the crank bearings
    may be way low with no warning of this.

3.  Splitting the oil flow will also reduce the amount of oil absorbing  
    the heat. This oil will not be directly cooled only indirectly by the
    mixure of hot and cooled oil in the sump.

Although the system your friend clearly works (tee-shirt, window open 
etc). Its impact on the lubrication of the engine would make me loath
to fit it to my van.
