I think if you did this you would be in deep do-do!
The fuel flow direction is pump --&gt; #3 inj. --&gt; #4 inj. --&gt; cold start 
valve --&gt; #2 inj. --&gt; #1 inj. --&gt; pressure regulator. If you clamp the 
input side of the cold start valve you would run full pump pressure to 
cylinders 3 + 4 only. 
Perhaps the Bosch manual is refering to an injection system that doen't 
have a cold start valve in series?
