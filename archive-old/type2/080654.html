&gt; Mark,
&gt;
&gt; You are on the right track in looking at the mix over the operating range.
&gt; Why the preset air/fuel map in your air mass sensor isn't correct isn't
&gt; clear. Maybe the PO fooled with it.

Unless I missed something, this would be an AFM, not an air mass sensor.
But, in any case, the &quot;map&quot; which plots required fuel for various inputs, is
contained in the ECU.  The AFM and AMS both perform the same function of
signalling to the ECU the engine's &quot;demand&quot; for fuel based on the air
flowing into the engine.  The problem with AFM's is that the spring that
resists the movement of the vane weaken over time, signalling to the ECU
that the engine needs a richer mixture than it really needs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The &quot;ideal 14.7:1 ratio or 0.450 volts&quot; is NOT ideal for air cooled VWs. I
&gt; try for no greater than 13:1 idle or cruise. Sorry but your guess as to
what
&gt; 13:1 equals on your set up is as good as mine. I would set it at 0.625
volts
&gt; and look at the plugs and exhaust color. Better rich than lean.

While it's true that, for engine longevity, running richer is better than
running leaner, I'm not sure your practice here has any real affect.  When
the engine's warmed up the ECU looks to run the mixture right around the
ideal ratio, which is right around .5 volts for a properly functioning O2
sensor.  So, if you unhook your O2 sensor, fool around with the idle air
mixture to run &quot;rich&quot; and then reconnect your O2 sensor, I'm not sure you
accomplish much.
