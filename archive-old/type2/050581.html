Subject: [T2] vw part number, wheres this engine from?

well I bought my second bus, officially my third aircooled vw.

When I spoke to the PO he mentioned that he picked up what he thought to be 
a german 2.0l with hydraulic lifters. Someone was kind enough to point out 
to me that VW germany did not make a 2.0l with hydraulic lifters, so where 
is this motor from?

I have a part number for it, but not sure where I could check what this part 
number meant.

Its listed as &quot;VWA 039100031D&quot; with a description listed as &quot;New 2.0 75/79&quot; 
If anyone knows of any background for this part number/motor??

Heres a pic of the new bus, ill get more once I have it home. I was going to 
have it towed to a shop to get the clutch unfrozen but when AAA showed up to 
his place this morning to tow if for me (he was nice enough to use his AAA 
to get it towed for me) it went right into gear and is apparently driving 
now. Great news for me, but im guessing he wishes he would have got a little 
more $$ for it now. So tonight it will be sitting side by side with my 
transporter, which sadly, will need to find a new home soon. Ive already 
been told im not allowed to own more than one. I wll post the details of 
this bus to the list first, then the price goes up some.
