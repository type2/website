&gt; Did this work on an Type I engine?  After about 1/2 hour of

&gt; held in place by a piece of metal sticking out of the fan housing (this is
&gt; the head with #1 &amp; #2 cylinders) which prevented it from being lifted up.

No kidding!  In order to get to the head bolts, the cylinder tin must come
off.  For the cylinder tin to come off the fan shroud and mainfold must
come off.  For the fan shroud to come off, the generator must come off.
For the mainfold to come off the generator and air cleaner must come off.

In short, the engine has to come out to make all this happen easily.
