&gt; 
&gt; I have reinstalled my newly rebuilt engine and am eager to try to start
&gt; it.  However, in the process of replacing hoses, I've become confused
&gt; about how all of the were connected.  My manuals (bently and haynes) are
&gt; very poor in terms of providing this information.  I have a few spefic
&gt; questions, maybe someone with a simialr rig can see how theirs are
&gt; connected...

&gt; VACUUM LINE FROM AUTO TRANNY

??????? huh???? the 77 is supposed to have the govenor shifter not the
vacumn shifter,  These are very different designs, if I recall the auto
tranny was changed in 74 or 75 from vacumn to govenor shifting also some
other changes.


&gt; 
&gt; this seems to go to the left side of the air distributor box, it requires
&gt; an attachment, since both tubes are the same diameter.  I have a T
&gt; spliter, which would serve that function, it could then go to one side of
&gt; the decel valve...
