shake your muffler and see if it's  rattling either against the frame or
internally

&gt; I see a lot of threads with this title (sorry) but this one has me
&gt; perplexed. It's coming from the rear and sounds EXACTLY like when  the rear
&gt; hatch is not closed tightly (not the case) - a loud  annoying rattling when
&gt; I hit a bump. I had my wife drive while I climbed in the back - still
&gt; couldn't isolate sound. This started about a month ago.
&gt; 
&gt; History: - this summer
&gt; 1) replaced fuel filler elbow (from Australia!)and neck.
&gt; 2) replaced CV boot AGAIN!
&gt; 3) removed engine, replaced tranny shaft seal, pilot bearing, main seal.
&gt; 
&gt; I've tightened everything I could think of. I have pushed and pulled on
&gt; major components and have jumped on the rear bumper to elicit the sound to
&gt; no avail.  Only happens while I'm driving. I seem to be missing a pair of
&gt; vice grips. Before I go tearing apart the fire wall to find them, is this is
&gt; familiar to anyone? Sounds like something bigger is rattleing.  Please
&gt; advise.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
