Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator or regulator or something else

REH,

Occasional near total loss of power may be related to electrical....what 
happens if the power feed to the ign coil gets loose?...or wiggles a 
little on bumps?

Be sure and remember to start with the battery connections and work from 
there.  I always do the ground from the battery first and then pull the 
ground strap from the frame to trans and make everything bright and clean 
there also.

hmmm...dimly illuminated brake warning light?...should be no where near
the voltage regulator connection.  The only voltage reg connection should 
be one wire running from the voltage regulator(a small one) to the alt
light in the instrument cluster....probably blue.

Pulling the tank is a last resort...check everything else possible first!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Symptoms include:
&gt; 
&gt; battery runs down
&gt; brake warning light is dimly illuminated when the headlights are on (there
&gt; is a connection to the voltage regulator, according to the wiring diagram).
&gt; 
&gt; maybe related:
&gt; 
&gt; occasionally, near total loss of power (originally, I thought this was
&gt; ignition related and have replaced every ignition components and have
&gt; installed a pertronix system.  I now think it is electrically or fuel
&gt; related - maybe a intermittent fuel blockage).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has advice, it will be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
