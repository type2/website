Subject: VW shows in Aug. In Colorado?

Hello all!

     I am planning to be in Denver, Co in Aug. I was told there is a
Gene Berg Cruise car show on the 9th and 10th, the RMMW show on the
11th, in Colorado Springs, and another show on the 12th in Denver. Can
anyone give me more info on these shows, any websites to look on, place
close to the shows for motel reservations, and etc? I need to get in
gear to get this trip planned, and to get my bus for her first big road
trip, before I know it Aug. will be here. 

More bus content tomorrow I'll be putting on my front chrome bumper, on
Star, that way she can be shining more brightly then ever. Also I
ordered new front seat covers so I'll be more comfortable, on the trip.
Thanks for all of the help, I'm sure I'll receive.

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
