Subject: are dead fuel injectors common?
Message-Id: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990618114729.1167E-100000_at_humdinger.geog.ucsb_dot_edu&gt;

Hi Volks,

I've found that two of my four fuel injectors are failing (work only 
intermittedtly, causing my bus to run like hell) and I'm replacing all 
four to be sure. 1978, 2.0L engine.

I replaced two of these about 5 years ago- at the hands of a Long Beach CA
VW dealership I was towed to when I broke down from what I concluded was
crap in my fuel tank. I'm pretty sure those guys were just ripping me off.
But now 5 years later my FI brain is working well, there's good
connections through the harness, and I'm replacing aparently failed
injectors. I've got about 210K miles on my bus (with a rebuild under way). 

The archives and library tell me how to diagnose failed injectors, but 
offer no information on how often they might be expected to fail. Any 
mechanics out there with enough engine experience to tell me what a 
reasonable lifespan for a fuel injector is?

Regards,
Surfer Bob
