Subject: Re: [T2] Yokohama Y370's

I had a set of Yoko Y370's on my aircooled Vanagon. I hit a curb in town
without obvious physical damage to the tire. About 400 miles into a long
roadtrip, I noticed a regular bumping...like you get on the highway...this
got worse until it felt like I was riding a jackhammer down the road. I
stopped several times and inspected the tire. Eventually, I located a
wally-mart tire center and had them rotate and balance the tires (free
lifetime rotate/balance/flat-fix) where the tech found the problem: one of
the tread plys had broken and a bulge was sticking out under the tread..they
said that, if I had of just ignored it, the tire would have eventually blown
out. So, I had them mount my good spare and I finished the 2000 mile round
trip without mishap.

I read somewhere in the WWW (that big trip to south america) that tread
separation was a problem that they experienced with the Yoko 370s ...so
perhaps my experience isn't just an isolated case and perhaps this is why
Yoko discontinued the 370 model line?

PS: I still have two of the Yoko 370s on the rear and two passenger tires on
the front that I will eventually replace with real tires.
