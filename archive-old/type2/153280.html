Subject: Aux Battery-Isolator-Solar Trickle Charger-Inverter

I have read a few of the past posts about Batteries, gone to Ratwell's and
other sites (including the OEMs).  However being the non-electrical type
there are a few questions to see if what I want to do is plausible.  And
also getting the right parts. While money is an object, doing it right with
the right parts is more important.
 
1978 VW Camper (Riviera version).
1.5 year old Les Schwab (750 Cold Cranking Amps) Battery that is DEAD, even
after taking it back for a charge. 
It ran for one day until I got in today and it was dead.
(http://www.hueymungus_dot_com/VW/1987ASIRivieraVWCamperBus/100_0601.html) 
I used to have a solar trickle charger hooked up to it, until I mangled the
wires and took it off.  It's from SunSei.

What I want to do is hook up a Aux Battery to an Inverter (to run coffee
maker, heater, DVD Player things like that...and not all at once..one or two
at a time).  Also I want to run the internal lights/radio off aux battery.
I also want to have a relay to the main battery just in case, plus to help
recharge it as well.  (I suspect that this is where the Isolator
http://www.surepower_dot_com/isolator.html comes in and/or
http://www.surepower_dot_com/separator.html).  All the while have the solar
trickle charger hooked up to both when not running.  (I like the
BatteryMinder solution, plus the readout unit that tells you what the
battery is up to http://www.vdcelectronics_dot_com/batteryminder_solar_15W.htm
).
 
The solar panel is not going to be over 15 watt since I am not expecting it
to run internals off the panel, just keeping both batteries in good running
order.  

Can this be done? (I suspect yes). Has anyone done this?
Do I need to change the alternator, to make sure I am not overloading the
one I have. (I do not know what kind I have now).  
I would rather not include the alternator (if at all possible) since it's
just one more thing to fry and troubleshoot while out having a good time.

I suspect that I am going to use the Yellow Optima batter for the Aux and
just get a totally new Battery from Les Schwab/or other dealer that is good.
 
Also, I would be keeping the whole setup under the Z-bed or build it into
cabinet section
http://www.hueymungus_dot_com/VW/Cabinets/daddybus_cabinets004.html and not in
the engine compartment. 
(I am going to at some point install a Oil Cooler there).

FYI: I am in Portland, OR.  Photos of the bus are at www.hueymungus_dot_com/VW
Thanks for reading and your replies.
