&gt;Do you know if they're going to license the VW logo?

They won't be putting the logo on. I don't think any vendor wants to do this after the way VW has treated them.

I don't know if mine as typical but they're wider than the rears. I think some if not all Westfalia campers had them installed as rock guards for the propane tank.
