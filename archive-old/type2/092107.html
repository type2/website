Subject: Looking for fuel system parts, 81 Vanagon

Hi All:

I am in the process of replacing the grommets and vent lines on my 81
Westy's fuel tank. I am looking for a source for two parts:

- The grommet on the two vent tanks, VW part # N 90100501,
- The gas filler assembly VW # 251-201-119A (the number on this one is
hard to read and since ETKA in no longer online I have not verified this
part number).

I have searched Rocky Mountain Motorworks, Bus Depot and my Bus Boys
catalog (their web site also seems to be down) but no luck yet. I have
not gone to VW here yet, but that will be my next task.

Any source suggestions?

Regards,
--Jeff Strickrott
