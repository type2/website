Subject: Re: [T2] turn signal flasher



&gt; 
&gt; Can someone tell me where the turn signal flasher is located on a 70 
bus?
&gt; I can hear it clicking very slowly, but can't find it. Have to find 
it to get 
&gt; it
&gt; inspected.

It is plugged into the bottom of the fuse block.  Disconnect the 
battery ground.  On the fuse block, pull the tab with the rectangular 
hole away from the plastic and the whole block will slide up out of its 
bracket.  One of the three &quot;cans&quot; plugged into the fuse block will be 
the one you want.  It will have three terminals and can be replaced 
with a common three-terminal flasher.
