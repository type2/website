Content-Description: cc:Mail note part

Some will say you can tell by the feel of pushing in the rocker, or the
push-rods, or the springs on the rocker shafts. But these parts may very well
have been messed with on such old cars. There are only 2 real ways to tell:

1. With that cylinder at TDC Back off the adjuster till there is clearance and
then turn it in 1 or 2 turns. Then note if the valve stem end moved in when the
adjuster was turned in.

2. Remove the lifter and look at it. Hydraulics will (should) have the retaining
ring inside the lifter
