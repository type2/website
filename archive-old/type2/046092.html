Subject: [T2] `67 engine selection &amp; cooling

Is it true that a `67 westy with anything bigger than a stock 1500 needs
scoops to provide adequate cooling? I'd like to go with 1600 SP or DP
but I don't like the idea of placing scoops on the side of an other wise
good looking vehicle. Are there other options? I'd like to cruise at
60-65 mph.

Thanks.
