&gt; I Just replaced the front brakes on my 73 Hanover (Blue Toaster)
&gt; Machined the rotors new pads et. after a few weeks I began to get a
&gt; horrible squeal from the brakes when applied lightly going away when
&gt; heavy pressure is applied. I replaced the pads with OEM replacement
&gt; parts it was ok for a few weeks then it returned any suggestions?

Did you put the thin metal anti-squeal shims between the pistons and
shoes?  These sometimes get lost.  What these shims do is to hold the
pistons in place so that one end of the pad gets a bit more pressure
than the other.  The metal shims should have a couple of punched tabs
that stick out and engage with the cutout in the piston, preventing
the piston from rotating.  If the tabs are squished down they can be
bent back out, then the piston rotated to match.
