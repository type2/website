Subject: Re: [T2] Head swapping question 


&gt; The F.I. 2 liter engine has smaller valves to minimize (I think) the intake 
&gt; pulses that would confuse the AFM. They also came with mild cams to help 
&gt; the same problem.

Correct, as stated in my original post. What I'm trying to determine is
whether or not this will have a detrimental effect when running with carbs.
 
&gt; The only other problem I see is that the 2L heads are going to have a 
&gt; larger hole for the top of the clyinder than you need and I do not know if 
&gt; this will cause sealing problems or not.

No. The cans are the same diameter. The stroke is longer on a 2l. I confirmed
this yesterday at the local VW FLAPS by comparing head gaskets for 2l and
1.8l heads. They are identical. (Different part numbers, but identical.)
