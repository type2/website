&gt;The 1700 head  inside diameter is 87mm. Values:  40mm intake  35mm exhaust
&gt;the 1800 head inside diameter is 92mm.  Values: 39mm intake  32.07.... exhaust.
&gt;The diameter where the actual cylinder fit into the head was 105mm on each
head.

Aha ! Problem solved by p-mail !
The dimension given for &quot;inside dimension &quot; was a linear measurement of
the largest dimension of the combustion chamber. This is not relevent.
The correct measurement of combustion chamber is volume.
Here's how:
Make a clear hard plastic circle to fit inside the head recess.
Drill a small hole in it.
Grease the edge and fit it there.
Get a 60cc syringe from the vet ( cat doctor :) for free, and
fill the combustion chamber with colored water, removing the
bubble by tilting the head.  This will be the volume in CC's
that you need to compute the compression ratio and match
chamber volumes.

&gt;I looked, and there was no machining to the 1700 head it appeared. the
thickness of the head &gt;was proportionate  and all.  It was the 1800 head which
had been machined previously in it's &gt;lifetime though...

No, that 1.7L head has been flycut to fit the bigger bore.
Appearances can be deceiving. For instance, i look
exactly like Brad Pitt ( with an equally proportionate
thickness of the head :).
