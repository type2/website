Volks,

   I did my rebuild and did not identify the coil wire hookups other than 
coil and did not getm back on right and am experincing problems as in when I 
put the heater levers down (red ones ) the bus dies. Is this or could this be 
because Im on the wrong side of the coil w something? My temp gauge and oil 
psi gauge wont work either and assume this has something to with that too.
  Any ideas?
  Thankyou and Happy Thanksgiving,
