Subject: Eastwood's gas tank sealant
Message-ID: &lt;23223-36F5C9D5-328_at_mailtod-242.iap.bryant.webtv_dot_net&gt;
Content-Disposition: Inline

I have replaced the big fuel line (hose) that connects the gas tank to
the filler neck in my '70 station wagen. Not because it was leaking, but
because it was 29 years old, and I had read of leaks here on the list.
Well it leaks now. One hose, two clamps, how hard could it be?
I did this while I had the tank out to give it the
Eastwood's Gas Tank Sealant Kit treatment.
I followed the steps very closely, but when I filled up, I noticed that
this sealant was already
peeling off inside the filler neck. Anyone else had this experience? 
I know I have to fix the leak right now, but I'm guessing I can wait
until pieces of this sealant starts clogging up my fuel filter on a
regular basis, to pull the tank an seal it again? Any other suggestions
other than Eastwood's?
I really need to drive my bus for a while before I forget why I love
this high-maintenance vehicle.
Thanks,
Jeff Buckmaster
