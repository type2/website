Subject: Re: [T2] Brake caliper

The problem is that the caliper appears to me to be perfectly  symmetrical
so that the bleed screws can be situated towards the inside on either side
simply by turning it 180 degrees. I've twisted and turned this caliper every
way possible and it still appears that it will go on either side.  RMMW and
Bus Depot list different part numbers, left and right, so there must be some
difference.  Nevertheless, I  can't see what characteristic(s) distinguish
the left caliper from the right caliper on a 72 Westy.  Looks like I'm not
alone, though! :-)

Thanks

Rich Patano
72 Westy

&gt; Rich,
&gt;
&gt; The bleed screws will face *in* :-)  take it out to your bus, crank the
&gt; wheels over all the way to one side and put the caliper up against the
&gt; existing caliper.
