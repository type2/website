&gt; there seems to be a lot of talk about the rarity of buses.  I live in
&gt; Seattle, and you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a bus here.  They
&gt; are everywhere.  I have three on my block alone.  I see aobut 20-25 of them a
&gt; day, not counting Vanagons (which seem rarer).  Maybe we just have a glut
&gt; and I should keep quiet about it or risk losing them all :)

How many are splitties, though? It would be good to know there is an 
abundance of these somewhere. I'm guessing there aren't 50 of 
these vans left in Eugene/Springfield... or they are VERY well hidden. 
You see one about every 2 weeks.
