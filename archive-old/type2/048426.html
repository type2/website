Subject: Re: [T2] Water Tank Cap

[...] The bottom of the drain pipe on my 71 is 1.5 inch PVC pipe thread.  I went to
a local swimming pool supply and got everything I needed to install a drain
extension so the drain water is carried to the left side of the bus.  No more
peeing on my foot when I use the sink, now.

&gt; A truly amazing bit of trivia is that if you look under the sink in your
&gt; hotel room in Paris, home of the metric system, the drain pipe will be an
&gt; inch-sized pipe!  For whatever reason, plumbing is one of those fields
&gt; where inate conservatism has overcome reason.  The drains on Westies are
&gt; inch-sized fittings and you should be able to head down to any plumbing
&gt; supply house and pick up replacement parts, in both the US and in Europe.
&gt; I don't know if this is true in OZ, but I would be willing to bet a beer
&gt; that it is :-)
