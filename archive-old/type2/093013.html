Subject: Re: [T2] wiring harness

Bentley manual has a good wiring diagram for your bus.

Take each wire individually and chase it from it's source and to it's load. 
I did this when I was adding relays to my headlight circuits. The 
schematics make perfect sense after to learn to read them - color codes, 
wire numbers, symbols, etc.

Once I learned to read those schematics effectively it is easy to see that 
the bus wiring is not too bad.

I would be happy to correspond with you and head you chase the wires once 
you get a copy of the schematics so we are looking at the same things. We 
can do it on the list and everyone can pitch in here and there until we get 
you straightened out. Don't pay anyone. Spend a bit of that same money you 
would pay somebody on a decent light, a decent digital multimeter, and a 
Bentley. When you get done you will be smarter, have some new resources 
(tools), and you will have a new confidence in your bus and yourself.


&gt;I sent out an email weeks ago regarding signal relays....
