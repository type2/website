Subject: RE:  Heat distribution lever---'77

&gt;The defroster pumps, but there's a distinct lack of heat from the front

&gt;kick panel outlets, and I suspect that the heat distributor thang is
not 
&gt;working right (the dash lever just doesn't feel right).  

When you slide the air distribution lever up (for floor heat), does the
air stop or diminish from the defroster ducts?  If not, then you've
isolated you problem to that cable and flap.  If it DOES diminish or
stop the air from the defroster ducts, then check to see how much (if
any) air is coming from the rear vent - maybe it's all going back there
instead of to your feet.  

I don't know about 77, but my 73 has an adjustable cable under the bus
that can be used to adjust the floor heat air distribution from the rear
to the front.  Earlier buses (71 or 72 and older) have a knob under the
driver seat that allows on-the-fly adjustment - lucky dogs!
