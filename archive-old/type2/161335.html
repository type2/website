Subject: Re: [T2]another try for a 73 rear brakes assembly picture

hey mark .. i have the bentley but the diagram in there of the drum doesnt show me what i need to know...its more of of side view and pulled apart like not like a straight forward shot..  i havent found in the beltley what i need unless those two pages are stuck together LOL and thats possible from the grease content...
  somehow i have put something back together wrong.... i dont know if the ebrake lever is the wrong way or what but something aint right....
   
  thanks though mark...
   
  hey troy if you got a brake drum off already to take pics of it thats cool but if not dont go through no trouble....and thanks to you as well..
