Subject: re. vanagon seatbelts

I mounted mine by drilling holes in the back of the seat pedestal then using
large fender washers and grade 8 bolts for the retractors; the free end I
bolted in the original hole; the shoulder hanger will need a spacer to hold
it out far enough so that it can swivel- it's a 7/16&quot; bolt by the way.  I
know there will be some comments on the retractor mounting, but if the hit
is hard enough to pull that fender washer through, I don't think I'll be
around to care.  Be sure to mount the retractors as high as possible to
allow the maximum belt length.

Alternately (and I may change to this after I have an engineer friend look
at mine), you can fabricate a &quot;L&quot; bracket to mount the retractors, but you
have to consider your spacing carefully and if you have a Westy with a
swivel passenger seat it won't work I don't think.
