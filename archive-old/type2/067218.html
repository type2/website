Subject: 1600 vs 1641 ???

Hi,

I'm contemplating a top-end rebuild for my '66 (might split the case, but only 
for recreation) and was wondering about the trade-offs.

I'm pretty happy with the performance of the bus as it is now (1600 dp) but I'm pretty
sure she's stressing on the hills.  Would a 1641 make a noticible difference with respect
to hills?  I'd likely stay with stock carb.

Would mileage change either way?

My goal is a reliable engine, not a rocket (yeah, like thats possible...)

I'd appreciate some comments either way.

Thanks,
...Markus
