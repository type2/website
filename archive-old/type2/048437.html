AH! Good point Sean.  Can you tell my FI system is a hack job;-)?

Even in the CIS systems, the relay relies on the coil as a trigger for
the fuel pump for safety reasons.  

Fuel pump running + ignition on + wreck=TROUBLE 

Scott Frazer's crew cab FI page documents &quot;fooling&quot; the relay similar to
the above. The point of the test is to see if, after the fuel pump runs
for a few seconds, does the cold start problem still exist.  If running
the pump prior to ignition solves the problem, your fuel pressure
regulator may be bad.

Wow, using the fuel pressure gauge sounds quicker and there's definitely
less written instruction needed;)
