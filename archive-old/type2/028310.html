It would seem that my busdepot_at_email_dot_com address is down (or at least,
someone has told me so). Not sure how long this will be the case (probably
not long), but meanwhile if your email to me does happen to bounce, just
send it to ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com instead. That goes right to my local ISP.

Email sent to sales_at_busdepot_dot_com or via the website goes to Jerry De Baun
via a completely different server, and is unaffected.
