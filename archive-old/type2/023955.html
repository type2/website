Subject: intermittent valve tap. lifters? i dunno?
Message-ID: &lt;6c1a8cbd.245fdffb_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

ok, so i'm goin up to the mountains with my girlfriend for week about a month 
ago. About two hours into the trip after hitting about 70 down a big hill on 
the turnpike I hear this loud valve tappin noise. I usually dont break 65. I 
stop at the rest stop thats conveniently a half mile away and find the 
clatter is accompanied by a rather fast oil drip from the front seal. I 
realized i put a little too much oil in, but was stupid and said it wouldn't 
matter much, so i left it. Well, after a little while the valve tap quited 
it's self down and the oil stopped leakin. The return trip was completely 
uneventful. About two weeks later (just last week) i started it up in the 
mornin' and was off to the parts store to get some gauges when the valve tap 
was back. I let it warm up as usual and started drivin. After about a mile or 
so the tap slowly disappeared. About a nother week later (earlier tonight) 
the tap was back, but only for the first 30 - 40 seconds after starting. Just 
as before, it slowly took care of it's self.
    I guess i should note that its a 79 FI with hydrolics. i understand that 
there is no need to adjust the valves, but am wondering if they can loosen 
them selves up. I've got about 12,000 miles on new heads, rings, and other 
stuff. My dad tells me that it's the lifters from what i have told him, but i 
dont trust it. He only knows Fords and Nascar, and constantly nags me to sell 
my lovely VWs.
    Is there a way that i can find out if that is the problem without tearing 
down the engine. I checked with Muir, but he says nothing about lifters. From 
what i gather they are small, cheap (but important) parts at the bottom of 
the push rod area. And it will require tearing down the crankcase to get to. 
Is this right? If it is, are there other parts that should logically be 
replaced while i'm at it (like push rods, bearings, or other stuff)?  Any 
other diagnosis is greatly appreciated.

   Thanks to anyone with any insight on my problem...
