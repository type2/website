I have e-mailed the writer of the piece in hopes that she can help us locate 
Kathleen Gray. We'll see. 
In the meantime, I am willing to put alittle cash in the pot as well, not too 
much or I'll end up there too! But maybe with a few of us not in the Bay area 
pitching in a few dollars and those in the area pitching in a little time and 
mechanical know how...we'll improve her situation.
