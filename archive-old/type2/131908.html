Subject: Re: [T2] Warning - Schadek oil pump on Vanagon - no go

[&quot;&quot;]
[]
&quot;&gt; I find the cast aluminum engine mount bar (moustache bar?) INTERFERES
&gt; WITH THE PUMP COVER in such as major way that it is impossible to use
&gt; the pump.   ARRRRGGGHHH.
&gt; &quot;


Stop.  Take a deep breath.  i posted about this a few months ago.  I have
done this successfully.  Take the pump cover to a machine shop and have them
remove the entire lip on the pump cover.  What you end up with is a flat
piece of steel with the 4 holes for the studs.  Then you put it on and the
moustache bar fits no problem.
