Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Convert walkthrough to a bench seat?

Hi Don,

The middle seat from a passenger bus can fit alongside that late-bay 
kitchen. You'll be able to sit 2 in the back, two in the middle and two 
up front. You'll need to pull the middle seat out when you get to the 
campsite, but people have been able to make it work.

The other way to go is to add a rear-facing seat to the kitchen and add 
a full-width rear bed. That would give you seating for three across the 
back, one behind the passenger on the rear-facing seat and two up 
front.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I should clarify WHY I'm entertaining this chain of thought:
&gt;
&gt; My wife wants to seat 6 in the bus. Stock it seats 5. 2 in the rear
&gt; bench/bed, 1 in the jumpseat, and 2 up front. My bus didn't come with
&gt; the fridge at all, and I was just going to get another jumpseat to
&gt; mount where the fridge went behind the passenger front seat.
