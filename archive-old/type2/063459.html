On a recent Friday jaunt up the hills from Sacramento towards Tahoe 
I go passed (on the flats) by an early 60's bus. Red/White, roof 
rack with E Clampus Vitus bell, bicycle on back, various stickers.  
Further along starting to go uphill we met up again (though I was in no 
particular hurry).  Shortly therafter were were joined by a early 
70's Squareback.  Nifty, early 60' sbus, early 70's Sqbk &amp; a Early 
80's Vanagon.  Nothing like togetherness . . . until the hills 
separated the swift from the slow, me being the swifter of the 
three.
