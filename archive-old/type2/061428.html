Subject: Re: Cam shafts/head rebuild

Reground cams are a cost effective choice when rebuilding your
engine.

The purpose of the cam is to open the valves a certain amount at
at certain time.  The amount of lift and the timing can be ground
with a smaller circumference. All that you do is adjust the rockers
to take up for the reduced clearance on the non-lift portion of
the cam.

Good luck

&gt; I'm in the process of pricing out my rebuild of my 72 westy.  I was
&gt; doing some price surfing, and catalog digging and I noticed that RMMW
&gt; offered a &quot;Reground cam&quot;, and that's all they offered.
&gt;
&gt; What does this mean?  My understanding is cam's need replacing if they
&gt; wear is excessive, worn to much.  Also grinding removes material.  So
&gt; how can you regrind a cam, removing material, and increase the size to
&gt; meet original specs?
&gt;
&gt; Or is this a &quot;cheap&quot;, you get what you pay for, cam replacement.  Price
&gt; difference was more than $40
