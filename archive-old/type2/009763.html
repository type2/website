Melissa,

&gt;i would love for it to have the upper bunks found on the late models

You would have to remove the roof on your bus, and replace it with a 
later roof. A major job

&gt;I would ideally like to go to a larger 1700 engine. Does this &quot;bolt- in&quot;. 

No, you would have to make some big changes here, too.

The 1971 bus was the optimal year for the 1600 engine. I would love to 
have a '71, and I imagine there are others on the list who agree (not to 
mention that in California it's smog-exempt). Although you didn't ask for 
advice of this kind, I would plead with you not to change it. Maybe 
someone on the list would be willing to swap you even-steven for a '74.
