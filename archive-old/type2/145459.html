Subject: RE: [T2] Stripped cylinder head studs

For a cylinder head, the best thing would be to drill
out the old crap, re-tap the hole for a larger size,
then install a step-size stud. A VW mechanic or parts
store should have these. You would need to drill the
hole straight(or have the mechanic do it). This would
be a permanent fix, wheres helicoiling an existing
helicoil sounds like it might get you home but who
knows how far after that... 


&lt;SNIP&gt;
A friend of mine found out that the threads were
stripped out on the case of her 1500 SP (66 bus) where
the cylinder head studs go into the case. So I
suggested she get some self-tapping replacement studs,
