&gt; changed hands, they went away happy. I, however was a bit cheesed. Went and

&gt; but I did find quite a few posts where people said that they never put the 
&gt; pedal all the way to the floor, or turned more than 3200RPM. Why is this? You 
&gt; won't hurt anything. Really! The little type4 eng. was designed to turn high 
&gt; rpms, for extended periods of time. Slow piston speed, bullet-proof bottem 
&gt; end. Give it a try. You'll be rather happy with the results. And so a closing 
&gt; question. Am I the only one who drives like I've been pithed? Do most of you 
&gt; folks &quot;baby&quot; your rigs, never coming near red-line, for any reason? Never 
&gt; exceed 60mph? Now I'm very curious...

well I have an auto tranny and those things sort of keep you honest the
shift speed is somewhere in the 3000-3500RPM range,  I drive &quot;crisply&quot;
neither babying the engine or pistol whipping it either.  She's a daily
driver in the &quot;Big&quot; city and you best drive or park it.

on the road I rarely get over 65MPH but that is more because that is the
speed limit around here and if I don't see a trooper every 5 miles it is
a slow day, got a good driving record and wanna keep it that way.  Besides
I like to roll down the window and enjoy the scenery.
