Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 Cylinder Head Mystery Holes

Air injection holes I think for the old smog pump system.

Anyone else?

Have your machinist friend tap and plug these holes.

Don't run the engine any more because the hot gases can ruin the metal 
around these holes or worse start a fire.

&lt;snip&gt;

each hole is just to the outside and below the outermost intake manifold bolt

&lt;unsnip&gt;

Ciao!
