Subject: Re: [T2] Three point seat belts in the back of a 76 westy

Our 78 Westy has 3 point belts I took from parted Westy front seats-
with a 74 full width bed and fridge removed, I can seat a person on each
side with a shoulder belt - see http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin  
I used the mounts behind the bedseat, easy to reach on the left, but had
to cut a hole in the closet wall to access the mounting bolt.  I can't
recall if the 76 has a rotating passenger seat- you can put in a seat
belt for the rearward position; I did that for our daughter when she was
still in a babyseat.  Now she has her own bus!
