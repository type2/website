Are you going from the tank all the way. This is quite a job. Twenty feet
sounds like way more than necc. But the lines are different sizes. I can
give you exact to the mm on all lines but you need to give me a day or two.
Also it will be hard to keep track of which line is which. I need to post
the illustration and then we are in business. Other wise take a line off at
a time and cut to match. If you want the exact length then keep bugging me
and I'll get it to you.

Subject: [T2] Fuel Line Length: Try #2


Hey All -
[Note: I posted this inquiry a week ago with no luck, so I thought give it
another go.]  Say, can anyone tell me what approximate length of fuel line
is needed to do a total line replacement on a 79 bus?  I currently have
about 20 feet of HP fuel line on hand, but need to use about 6 inches for
something else and don't want to come up short.  I've seen various posts
where the claimed amount of line required ranges from 10 feet to 25 feet.
Thanks for your
help!

Travis
