Subject: Clunking sound in steering

Hi,

I recently purchased a '71 Westfalia and the steering makes a clunking sound.
The steering also has some play in it.  I crawled under the bus and the sound
seems to be coming from the steering box. All other linkage appears to be ok. I
have looked through the archives and noticed that a couple of others have had
similar problems, but there were no difinitive responses as to how to fix the
problem.  Will I need a whole new steering box? These are pretty expensive,
around $300, so if someone knows if the box can be rebuilt, I would apreciate
some guidance.

Thanks,

Orion
