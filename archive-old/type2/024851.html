ok. i went nuts on my 72 westy before my 'big trip'. i took the motor out,
spun it upside down on the stand and the dizzy drive fell out. i got myself
all worked up. called people. wrote to the list etc.  i have now had this gear
out, in, in and out of the motor half a dozen times. the spacer has never
given me trouble. the easiest way to get it out is to tip the motor upside
down with the dizzy out......    ok if the motors in the bus that aint so
easy. the next best thing is a small wooden dowel (home  depot etc).  i bought
a piece that was too big and ground it down until in fit where the spring goes
in the top of the gear. a little turn to the left and up and viola (voila?)
out it came, with the washer.  i put it in where i thought it should go and
people told me i was wrong. so out it came. put it back. didnt where i had it
so did it again.  ive learned that the right place is so that at tdc the rotor
is pointing to the crack in the block at the rear (rear is rear) of the motor.
or  at about 4-5 oclock. truth is it doesnt really matter as  the cap and
rotor will only go on one way.  so if you cant turn it enough to time it take
it out and reverse or forward it one or 2 teeth and youll be fine. the secret
here is do it slowly and be careful of that spacer. i was beside myself with
worry before i put it back in case the washer fell into the motor. in reality
its hard to screw this up as it sits on a shelf in there. put it on a piece of
wooden dowel with a bunch of grease. put the dowel in and then let go of the
spacer and let it slide down. easy peasy. 

having said all this. if there is anyway of fixing it where you dont have to
mess with the gear then do it that way.  david schwarze is an excellent
mechanic. and hes absolutely spot on when he says that you take a big risk
everytime you mess with this thing. i traveled with him to jerome and learnt a
lot from him, hes very knowledgeable  (if you meet him though wear a clean
shirt, hes funny that way).

just my $0.02 worth, 

marty 72 westy    among others :)
