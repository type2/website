Subject: Running problems with a 78 fuel injection Bus
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Disposition: inline
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id QAA87026

I recently picked up a fuel injected 78 Bus.  I picked it up fairly cheap, the previous owner said he had problems keeping it running.  I got it running pretty good for a day or two (just driving it around the neighborhood) but now it is doing what the PO had said.  It'll start up but when it starts to warm up it doesn't want to run.  I've played with the timing and checked all the vacuum hoses but that hasn't helped, any ideas?  Thanks.
