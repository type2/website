Subject: RE: [T2] Intermittent oil light

Okay, I've just received some Mann oil filters from Bus Depot so I'll get one of those in there with some 20W50.  Should I be worried about the oil cooler?  Consulting my Bentley manual it seems that I've got to remove the fan and some engine tin to access it.  In everone's experience, does outside crud on the oil cooler generally mean there's inside crud? 

Thanks,
--Mitchell

Hi Mitch,

The first order of business is a switch to 20W50. 10W30 is only  
recommended for severe cold operation. While you're at it nstall a  
good quality filter (Mann or Mahle are OK; Fram is NOT).

That should improve oil pressure.


Happy trails,
