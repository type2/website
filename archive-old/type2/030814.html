	Hey, gang. The 2.0 rebuild is finished, and I've been happily
driving for about two weeks now. On Monday or Tuesday, I'll be driving
far. Connecticut, from Texas. Maybe Colorado somewhere in the middle. I'll
post itinerary tomorrow, in hopes of driveways, coffee, and conversation.
	But in the meantime, I have a little conundrum: the oil pressure
is lower than I'd like. I consulted local [sure, San Antonio is &quot;local&quot; to
Houston!] guru Mike Gensler, who suggested I replace the oil pressure
relief valve guts. I swapped the piston on the big one at first, but I
noticed the spring in the little kit from the FLAPS was almost a good inch
longer than the one that came out of the motor. The pressure relief valve
fix-it kit, I think, is allegedly interchangeable between type 4 and type
1 engines.
	So in eyeballing the spring, I decided that it might be too long,
give me too much pressure, and possibly overcompensate for a deeper oil
pressure problem. However, damn if I can figure out what that might be.
When I boiled the case halves in TSP, I saw it bubbling happily from the
oil passages, which I hit with pipe cleaners later anyway. Same goes for
the passages in the crank. The oil pump had minimal wear, so I buffed it
to a shine and put it back on.

1. Is that spring the right length and mine just shrunk with wear?
2. What else would cause low oil pressure?

	I'll replace the other piston today, and, pending list wisdom, the
springs too. If you want numbers, I get 65 or so oil PSI with a cold
start, and after some highway miles, it drops to around 20-25 while doing
60 [my tach is acting up; sorry]. After exiting the highway, it will drop
to way below 10 at idle, seriously freaking me out. Not the sort of
signals I want before I put 3000 miles on her.

TIA, 

Ian
