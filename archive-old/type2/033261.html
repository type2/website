Subject: Re: [VB] cleaning up old windshields

Why not go to a glass shop and have a spanky new one cut?

&gt; The '72 has a spiffy new windsheild but the '67 is hurting. The glass has so

&gt; scratches. I really dont wanna replace the original glass. Are they are
&gt; products and or methods that will clean, polish or restore the glass?
