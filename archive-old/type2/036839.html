Subject: Trip computer

Hi All,

I've been trying to find out ways of hi-teching my camper, you know, puting
in a trip computer and that sorta stuff, and I found this site
http://www.oztechnics_dot_com.au/frame_car.htm It's for a 27 function trip
computer that can be installed in pretty much any car, in kit form it's
about $179AUD and sounds pretty good.  It includes all sorts of readouts
including a hookup to a PC where it can display a virtual dashboard and
record everything from speeds, fuel consumption, etc even fuel flow rate per
hour.  Thought anyone out there that was really interested in fuel
consumption etc would like the idea of this.

If I buy and fit it then I'll give you some VERY accurate fuel consumption
details etc, even my 1/4mile times if you want :)

Cheers
Steve
