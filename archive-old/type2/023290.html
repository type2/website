Subject: Re: [T2] Lower that bus?

By removing leaves you are removing much of the strength of the front axle.

Also you stand a chance at having the remaining leaves snap and then you 
have a dangerous situation where you could loose control if moving down the 
road at a good clip.

What if that happened at speed?

I would consider using AVUS adjusters sold by Gene Berg Enterprises. It 
gives you adjustability and reasonable safety. It is the same solution that 
the Porsche 356 used from the factory I hear.

A better solution is what I am using on my Beetle - which is dropped 
spindles with AVUS adjusters to fine tune the ride and height.

Where to get BUS style dropped spindles??? I don't know.

Doubt any of the domestic suppliers have them but you might check the 
German web pages. Time to find a translator utility and start searching.

Let me know though, I'd be interested...

&gt;Hypothetically, If I wanted to lower the front of my

&gt;Ive been told by some to remove several of the leaves
&gt;from the tubes in the beam. Is this safe?
