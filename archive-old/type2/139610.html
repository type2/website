Subject: Re: [T2] horn/light relay

Chris

Both FLAPS and Radio Shack carry just such a relay.  About $6.00
at RS and perhaps somewhat the same at the flaps.

http://www.radioshack_dot_com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=CTLG&amp;category%5Fname=CTLG%5F011%5F002%5F013%5F000&amp;product%5Fid=275%2D226

	Model: 275-226

30amp SPST relay with mounting tab.  You can use regular spade lug 
connectors to wire it in.  Wire the coil side in with your regular horn 
and then run a *healthy* positive wire to the &quot;common&quot; lug.

Then another healthy positive wire from the &quot;NO&quot;(normally open) relay lug 
to your air horns.  A good ground on the other side of the air horn and 
you are in business!

I have dual &quot;stock&quot; horns *and* air horns on another vw that I have
and this is the method I used.

You *will* get some serious noise out of them!

Cheers, dave

&gt; work.  Sooooo....  I need the relay to apply more juice to the horns.  
&gt; It would be nice to get both electrical devices from the same source.  
&gt; I tried Pep Boys just down the street, but $$$$$.
