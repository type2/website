Subject: HELP cvs won't rotate

To the person who couldn't get their CV to rotate along the vertical axis:
I did this once too and was a little bewildered.  It turned out that I had
assembled the inner race backwards.  The solution is to take out the inner
race and flip it over with respect to the outer race.  Hope that helps.
