Subject: 78... am I nuts or what?

I have a 78 westfalia waiting in the wings.  The current owner is willing 
to part with it fo 400 to 500 dollars.  The interior is looking great... 
the exterior is rusted to hell in some spots.  the engine runs the tranny 
is missing gears 1 and two.  So  would I be crazy to buy this thing...  
and is there a book that actually describes bus restoration for the 
complete idiot &lt;me&gt;.  ie does it tell reader how to take off a side 
panel!
