Subject: Re: [T2] Case sealing methods

&gt;From: Mark Hineline

&gt;&gt;Costs a bit more, but it really does work better than the avaiation 
&gt;&gt;selant.

&gt;This really gets at my quandary. What does &quot;work better&quot; mean? If a case 
&gt;will seal up without any sealant at all, then how much work does the 
&gt;sealant have to do?


Mark Mark Mark,  You missed the point, it is not how much work they have to 
do, it is how much better it will be. ;-)  Snake oil?... hardly You may have 
gotten lucky with the last one not leaking, but how many miles did you get 
out of it? How many drip free miles would you like to get out of the engine 
this time? Sealant is your friend and all friends have their own problems. 
Some need lots of attention and caring, others just want to be used, etc. 
Which friend will you choose?

You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick 
your friend's nose.
