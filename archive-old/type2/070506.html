Subject: tribal community and the vw web

Hey all!

My name is Buck and after lurking for a few weeks and then subscribing to the
digest, I thought it was finally time to add another voice to the harmony of
this choir.  In the 70's, my father was a trucker and the &quot;CB&quot; was the
unifying tool that allowed an individual to reach out and become part of
something bigger than themself with others that were &quot;like&quot; them--in essence,
a member of the tribe.  Technology may change, but the longings of our
spirits is a constant.  How wonderful that we have this ultramodern/high tech
forum to discuss our passion for 50+ year old enginering.  But although the
&quot;bus&quot; is our topic of discussion, it is obvious that it is the sense of
community (or tribe) that brings us back to this forum day after day.
 Without personally knowing any of you (except Rusty Vanbondo) I feel like I
know of all of you because we share that same feeling whenever we pilot our
busses off to the next great adventure (which may be just a trip to the
grocery store).  As there becomes fewer and fewer of our precious
friends--the bus--left on this planet, I only hope our passion for their
existance increases and we stay united to do whatever it takes to keep Big
Brother from telling us we can't drive our old friends anymore.

I know this is a rather heavy first posting but my sense of identity with you
all is genuine and deep, and if this was a Honda site it would have just been
a waste time.

I send my appreciation to the creators/maintainers of this forum and wish you
all well in your travels and mechanical endeavors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
