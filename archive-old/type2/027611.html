When I bought my bus I thought the lady that used to own it was crazy. There 
was an A/C system installed but like you mentioned not only was there a fan, 
but the AC was also going attached to the lid. The downside of this was when 
I work on my bus, if I'm not *very* careful, the lid will come down on the 
drop of a hat and smack my face into the engine :/ not too comfy.... As for 
trying it... my system seems to be out of Freon, so I can't really so 
anything with it!
