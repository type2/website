Subject: Re: [T2] engine rebuild

 Rus, The measurements you want cannot be gotten
without the engine being torn apart, I believe you can
buy the parts from Bus Depot as you need them as cheep
as or cheaper and get good parts rather than go with
the kit you are talking about. What state are you in,
someone may be able to come over and show you how to
do the measurements on the engine, I just don't know
where Bartlesville is in relation to Easley, South
Carolina.. Phil
