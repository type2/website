Subject: Need a throttle linkage nut for an auto transmission

I am rebuilding a '78 Westalia with an automatic.  Putting things back
together I find that the nut and any washers that clamp the throttle linkage
arm to the tranny is gone.  It appears (from a WAG) to be an M10 x .80, and I
don't know where to find one.  It is harder to determine the size because it
(the stud) is flat on two sides to keep the throttle arm in position.  That's
the closest I could get from holding other parts up to the stud.  I know that
an M6 x .80 bolt has threads that mesh nicely into the stud, but ???  If
anyone knows what diminsions it is and/or where to find one I'd  appreciate
it.  Mostly I guess I would just like to find one even if no one knows what
thread it is.  Also, any good reference sites for the T2-Automatic would be
great as I have always had sticks till now.
Thanks.
