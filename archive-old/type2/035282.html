&gt;Hi Joe
&gt;
&gt;Please keep us posted on this booster hose find. 

I sure will. Just another little tidbit: the manufacturer markings on this
stuff are:

PARKER 601-8 WP 6,9 MPa (1000 PSI) MSHA IC-40/10 ..-.. SAE100R3-8 12,5 mm
(1/2) X 2F 8-3Q99

I figure this info may help some of you find it locally rather than having
to call Fluid Air, (800-247-4673).

I installed the rest of the hose today without much of a hitch. I was not,
however, able to attach it directly to the plenum, as it is too stiff and
perhaps a smidgen too small. I used some lower pressure hose and cut it
very short; then I attached that to a heavy plastic tee that I picked up at
Fluid Air and attached the heavy hose to that. This is to solve the problem
of the NLA connector that goes between the plenum and the hose. It's a
t/y-connector that feeds 2 vacuum lines.

Thanks! Joe
