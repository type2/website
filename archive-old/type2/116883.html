Subject: Westy luggage rack needed in SoCal

Greetings List,

First post from me. Let me start with the obvious, you folks are incredible 
with all of the knowledge and advice you share. I appreciate it and look 
forward to reading it every day.

Second, I can't seem to find a salvage yard with a fiberglass luggage rack 
for my 81 Westfalia. Color is of no importance, as I will paint it to match 
my pop-top. I have called several in the book and a few more my local 
mechanic recommended, but I need some help.

I am new to the area, between LA and SD in south O.C. so if anyone could 
recommend a place to find one I would appreciate it. Also, if anyone knows 
the going rate, that would be of some help, too. I've gotten mixed quotes 
from as high as $200 in the Pacific Northwest and $50 in central CA, but I 
am sure there are a wealth of them closer to me (I prefer to avoid shipping 
a large piece of fiberglass across the country or even across the state if 
possible...)

Thanks in advance to all SoCal listees with any help you can provide.



Cheers,
