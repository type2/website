Subject: [T2] Cylinder heads

I recently acquired a dead 1975 bus with an 1800cc fuel injected engine for 
little more than a song. Tore down the engine, and found an exhaust valve 
guide had slipped toward the chamber and met the head of the valve. The 
piston got chewed up by the resulting debris and so did the area just below 
the combustion chamber on the head. I am doing a total rebuild to be sure all 
the guide shavings are out of the case. 

I'm having an awful time locating a replacement head. No salvage yards in my 
neck o' the woods has anything that was made east of Rhode Island or west of 
San Francisco. Ordered one over the net from a yard in Calif. Got a 74 head 
with a totally different chamber. They refunded the purchase price but I out 
the shipping. Oh well! Live and learn.

So, Does anyone have a cylinder head for a 1975 1800cc federal (not 
California)? The part number I found embossed in the casting near the valve 
springs is 
022 101 371H. Any help is most appreciated.

Also, Does anyone have info on equalizing combustion chamber size in these 
heads. I have experience CC'ing heads years ago, but not on German stuff. It 
looks like I could grind a little in the area opposite the spark plug. Please 
help if you know the answer.
