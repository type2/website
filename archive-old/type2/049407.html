Subject: [T2] upper control arm bushings

I am looking at replacing my upper control arm bushings as they are
squeaking pretty bad.  The Bentley shows a relatively easy job.  The shops
around here want about 2.5 hours per side.  About $330 for the whole job.
Am I over simplifying  the job or is it harder then I think?  Any input &amp;
ideas here would help.  BTW this is on my my 82 Vanagon Westy.  Thanks.
