Subject: Re: [T2] ignition wires

thanks Kyle.. Ok, after researching this, it looks like on a 1975 and up, there is a gray wire off the ig. that goes to the buzzer.  Apparently, I have the wrong ig. in my 73.
A couple strange things though..my door switch has 5 wires coming off it when the diagram says there are only 4.
Also, then what does the wire that is coming from the ignition (brown/blue) and going to that extra door wire for?
All the diagrams show only 5 wires coming off the ig. switch. Mine has this extra brown/blue wire.
Anyone willing to tell me what this wire is?

I'm not positive, but isn't the wire that goes to the switch on the drivers 
door the one for the buzzer?


&gt;Ok, I got the ignition out-
&gt;5) to driver door switch
&gt;6) ?????? it's cut off- gray color
&gt;
&gt;I can't find this in the Bentley or archives...
&gt;Maybe a wire to what was the BUZZER??
