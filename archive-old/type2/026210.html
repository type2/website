	Subject: [T2] Strange Oil Level

	One weird thought I've had is that the new filter is not full
	of oil (hence the high level) - do filters ever NOT fill with oil
for
	whatever reason?  Just a thought.  Thanks for any opinions!

That weird thought reminded me of a bad experience my dad had a few years
ago.  He took his car into Sears for an oil change and ended up replacing
the engine shortly after because they put the wrong oil filter on.  The
filter didn't match up so the oil couldn't circulate through the engine.
