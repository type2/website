Subject: Sink stopper needed

Does any one have a spare sink stopper for a '78 Westy?  Some low-life took
mine at the last show I went to.  I was away from the bus all day at my swap
space, so it probably occurred then. I just noticed it was missing when I
went to drain the tank for winter today.

Thanks,
Brad Clausen
