Subject: Selling wonderful 72 Westy

Hi All,

We are finally selling our much loved 1972 Westy.  She has been a wonderful
vehicle but advancing age (ours, not hers) requires that we find a camper with
more room and comfort (probably a 1986-? vanagon westy).  This is very
difficult for us so we want to find a good home for her.

We live in Gig Harbor, WA (close to Tacoma).

Asking price $4,000.

She is currently running great and is ready to roll.

Here are the facts about Lily:

**157,000 miles
**12,000 miles ago:
--very strong 2.0 engine professionally rebuilt by OVALS in Federal Way, WA
--new clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing 
--new front brake rotors and calipers 
--new rear brakes, slave cylinder, and break shoes 
--new brake master cylinder and brake lines (rubber) 
--new throttle, heater, and clutch cables; 
--new exhaust system; 
--new pop top seal
**dual carbs (recently worked on, newly calibrated and adjusted)
**Hydraulic Lifters (no more valve adjustments or burnt valves)
**pop top
**bed downstairs/cot upstairs 
**lots of cabinet space
**ice box (no fridge or stove in '72)--will include free coleman stove
**sink/pump work perfectly
**mosquito net 
**interior in good shape and very clean 
**Butterscotch color paint looks good with minor rust **good bumpers
**missing sun visor on passenger's side
**decent canvas on the pop-top
**great Pioneer stereo (4 speakers/cd player) with detachable face
**new 8 ply tires
**2 vw manuals (including excellent shop manual)

****runs great, ready to go

Plus, of course, she also has a HUGE heart and spirit and is VERY beautiful.

She can be seen on the WetWesties page (wetwesties_dot_org) by viewing pictures of
member vw's, then Dale and Trish's Campmobile, Lily.

I have other pictures I can send to you electronically if you want.

Thanks,

Dale and Trish
