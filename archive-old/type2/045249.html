Last week I went to fill the gas tank on my 1973 bus, (the gauge showed empty) when lo and behold, the tank filled with only 8.5 gallons!! When I came back from the cashier with the change, there was a MAJOR gas &quot;waterfall&quot; on the left side of the engine!!! The filling is done on the right side of the bus, but the leak was on the left side!!! Did anyone have this happen to them before??
