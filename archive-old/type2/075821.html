i'm already on it.  you can email me about that if you want to and we'll see
what happens.

body:nothing special.._dot_usable, but some damage. old paint, lot's of light
rust color starting to come through slowly.  cracked winshield, pulled a
dent in driver's front, so lot's of little holes., but no problem with rain.
i would drive it.  I've driven this bus all around the country and back
again. own a legendpop. top doesn't pop.

no speedo,manual turn signals, no wiper motor, clutch has 20,000 on it.
