Subject: Re: [T2] Front Seats

&gt; Two `77 bay front seat questions.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Looking down on the front seat mounts, me facing forward in the bus,
&gt; there are a pair of little plastic doodads, one on each mount.  They're
&gt; placed facing each other.  The right side one is mounted in what would be
&gt; the lower left-hand corner of the top of the upper seat mount area, and the
&gt; left side one is in the same corresponding spot on the other side.

If you look at the beginning and end of my seat restoration page you can see
how the swivel mounts:


My 78 only has the passenger swivel
and it is built into the pedestal, Any seat
will fit in it, You probably have to weld in the
swivel mechanism, if you want it.
