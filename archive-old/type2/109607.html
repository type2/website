Subject: [T2] Tune-up price


&gt; I have a quick question. My 72 bus needs a valve adjustment and the timing
&gt; corrected. My local VW guy quoted me $250 for a tune-up and complete
&gt; check-up. Does this seem reasonable?

If the shop charges $250 /hour, including a &quot;partial hour&quot; the price is fair
:)
There is a current debacle over on the vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com list
regarding bogus shops in your area.
The specific shop listed is Import Engines, Winter Park FL.
You may want to discuss your problem with Diane, a lister
who has been receiving extremely poor service there.
Diane djaeby_at_hotmail_dot_com has a 67 bus.
