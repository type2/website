Subject: RE:  [T2] someone had jacks 4 sale 

Kyle, I know this is not an answer to your question, but something you might 
want to think about.

I have a bus jack plus TWO Honda scissor jacks in my bus.

I have had to change my rear tire(s) on the road at least five times, and 
here is the system which I developed.

1) I place one of the Honda jacks under the bottomist part of the shock 
absorber mount.  Then for every inch of jack travel upwards, the wheel 
travels upward the same amount.  I only have to jack the bus up a few inches 
to get the wheel up a few inches.

2)  Unfortunately, if your rear is sagging, you will have a hard time 
getting the wheel off and back on.  The top of the tire will be caught 
behind the wheel well.

DON'T force the wheel OFF, because you will NOT be able to get the good 
inflated wheel back on in this condition!!

Now you need to jack up the BODY of the bus a few inches.  You can use your 
bus jack to do this, or your extra Honda jack, which of course does not have 
enough travel by itself and needs some extra base...

3)  Unfortunately, if you rear is RAISED (opposite of 'sagging'), you will 
not be able to lift the rear shock support enough to get the good inflated 
wheel back on.

Yes, you will be able to get the flat tire/wheel off with NO problem because 
there will be enough room at the top/wheel well and you can yank the tire 
off (I was going to say 'jerk the tire off' but that would have not passed 
the censors. But I guess the Brits would equate 'yank' with 'jerk' 
anyways... )

But you really will feel foolish with a good spare tire that will not match 
up with the lugs by just a few millimeters.

So you wind up letting the bus down on the horizontal flat tire/wheel while 
searching for something to give you just another half inch of lift on the 
Honda jack and you are now an accident waiting to happen....

4)  Forget it.  Call AAA
