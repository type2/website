Subject: Re: Automatic transmission: repair or replace

I second the opinion of the one who recommended, &quot;If it's an automatic, 
keep it an automatic. If it's a manual, keep it a manual.&quot; I explored the 
possibility of converting my automatic '78 to a manual transmission and 
concluded that it would be a total PITA, cost several thousand dollars, 
and I couldn't find anyone who would do it for me. You'd be way ahead to 
sell the automatic tranny bus and buy a manual tranny one rather than 
undertake the conversion.

Just replace the torque converter bearing and seal and go ahead. Or have
the torque converter rebuilt (I did this once and it cost about $100 at a
torque converter rebuild shop in San Diego.). A completely torn down and
rebuilt automatic transmission will run from $700-$1200 depending on what
it needs inside, if you pull the tranny and take it to the shop. 

You probably just need the $5 TC bearing and $12 seal though. Of course, 
you do have to pull the engine to get at these things.

Good luck,
