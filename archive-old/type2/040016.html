Subject: Follow-up to Propane Tank exchange

Hello Listers:

We discussed propane tank replacement last week.  Here's what I did:
I bought a new tank (8&quot; diameter), slightly larger than the old tank but it 
still fits under the stovetop.  (a better fit, actually)  I bought an 
adapter that screws into the old regultor and accepts the new style tank 
fitting.  Now good for another 12 years!

I'm cookin' with gas again.

Best regards,
