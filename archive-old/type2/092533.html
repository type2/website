Subject: Re: [T2] locked in place

95% chance all it needs is to remove the latch, clean it and lube it. Mine 
was exactly as you describe before I did so and now works smooth as new.

At 11:48 PM 06/18/2002, you wrote:

&gt;The lock on my driver's side door is beginnning to stick.  When you turn 
&gt;the key it doesn't quite push the knob all the way up on the first try 
&gt;always.  I can get it open, but it takes a couple tries and feels like the 
&gt;key is gonna snap.  I really don't want to end up with different keys for 
&gt;each door and the ignition.
&gt;Is their anything I can do about this?  Does the lock need to be 
&gt;rekeyed?  I am looking to correct this as inexpensively as possible, but I 
&gt;would also like to know the correct way to fix it even if it isn't the 
&gt;cheapest.
