Subject: Re: [T2] blinkers and flashers

&gt; I turn on the turn signals the generator light comes on and the outside 
&gt; lights
&gt; don't blink.

I had this same issue and it turned out to be that little black box
of relays and such that all your signals go to. In my case for some reason 
it had broken
and not all connections were being made. My solution was a rubberband to 
hold
both halves together. Worked like a charm.
I believe it is called a &quot;blinker box&quot; or &quot;9 prong box&quot; unofficialy.


They  do blink when I turn on the emergency flashers but
&gt; the
&gt; generator light comes on also.  Any thoughts or suggestion are 
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; Steve

My issue did not involve the GEN LIGHT. Im not sure how it would be 
affected.
