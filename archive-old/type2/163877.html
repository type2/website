&gt; Ken,
&gt; It sounds like you procrastinated on this job for awhile, and now your
&gt; backs to the wall.

I wish it was that simple.  If I had simply procrastinated, I would
just go buy the topcoat and seals finish it.  I have three kids at
home - finding the time to go to the bathroom uninterupted is not
always an easy task.  Keeping a $5 bill in my pocket for more than a
day ain't the simplest of chores either!

&gt; A car cover will keep dust and dirt off of the primer , but will not in
&gt; any way prevent the car from getting wet.
&gt;
&gt; The Primer is clay based product, and will absorb moisture even with a
&gt; car cover on it.( not unless you used a epoxy or polyurethane primer,
&gt; but as you mentioned your short on funds so I'm assuming you short
&gt; cutted the job and went the cheapest route )

Actually, I am using PPG epoxy primer and PPG filler primer that were
recommended together from the local paint shop.  I'm not sure what the
filler primer is but.... I haven't taken the cheapest route at all -
not all of us out are swimmin' in disposable income.  I still need to
come up with another $250-300 to replace the seals and buy the
topcoat.  By the time that happens the weather is going to be cold
around here.  Unless you have a paintbooth in or near Lancaster
County, PA that you're inclined to let me use come October.


&gt; So--here is your one option's for winter storage.
&gt;
&gt; Rent a Storage area.
&gt; Buy a cheap blue platic tarp and cover it up.

Is this going to be effective?  I had considered that option but, I
don't really like it.

Later,
Ken
