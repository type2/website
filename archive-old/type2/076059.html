&gt; Bryan, don't waste your money on a locksmith on something you can do
&gt; yourself. An old VW guru in S.C. showed me how. I've done it twice, once on
&gt; my 71 Superbeetle, and the second on my 71 T2. If the ignition key is the
&gt; same type as the door key you can make one key fit all. If the ignition key
&gt; is of a different type then you will have to settle for two keys or replace
&gt; the ignition. My SB had a new style replacement ignition with the round head
&gt; and the doors had the offset head, so I got the ignition out of a junk Beetle
&gt; in the bone yard, cost me two bucks. Pull the door handles, then remove the
&gt; lock from the handle, stick the ignition key in the lock. You will see some
&gt; of the little brass plates (tabs) sticking up, these must be flush in order
&gt; to turn in the handle, do ya get the picture, just file them smooth. Stick

This can be done to one or two plates, but your best bet is to rearrange
the plates to match the key.  VW didn't file or grind the plates to fit!
