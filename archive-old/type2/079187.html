&gt; Why the sudden, excessive clearance? Have I dropped a valve seat? If so, why
&gt; has this happened?

sure sounds like it.  

&gt; I had the heads rebuilt 4,000 miles ago - new valves, guides, springs...

did the person who did it know how to work on air cooled heads, they run
many degrees hotter than a water cooled head.   

I have had a head done by someone who really knew what they were doing go
bad in less than 5k.  seems the DPO had overheated the head and the seats
lost thier &quot;Temper&quot; and were soft.

I have had good luck with &quot;Diesel&quot; valve seats and have them mechanically
interferred with when seated.
