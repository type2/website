Subject: installing seat pedestal mats--tips? warnings?

Greetings, folks:

I got inspired several weeks ago, beginning with reupholstering the driver's 
seat on my 1970 [and having it come out looking pretty good, somewhat to my 
surprise], so I re-covered the passenger seat and replaced the kickboards, 
too. Now I'm about to install new pedestal mats.  I've got both parts, and 
they're here on my living room floor, breathing.

I have a general idea of what's going to be involved with the installation: 
I can see where the pieces generally fit, and where they will have to be 
carefully cut to let hardware pass though the material. Now I have some 
specific questions before I get into it:

* What holds the mats in place? [The fact that I don't know the answer to 
that shows just how little is left of my old mats!] I've found some clips 
that seem designed to hold the side pieces where the walk-through is; are 
there others? Or is it mainly gravity and the seat belt buckle anchors that 
hold the pieces in place?  I also see traces of what might once have been 
blobs of adhesive on the metal pedestal in places where the original mat is 
long-gone. Will I need to use some adhesive at some spots?

* In addition to pulling the seats out and removing the seat belt buckle 
anchors, what else has to be moved for the installation? Does the panel 
behind the passenger seat have to come out?

* Anything else I should consider before I get into the middle of the 
procedure and realize I've painted myself into a corner?

Thanks in advance!
