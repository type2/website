Subject: Re: [T2] help me remove my head

Air injection system or pushrod tubes?

If it is pushrod tubes grab each tube gently with some slip joint pliers 
and twist back and forth with a gentle pull away from the engine block and 
they will slide right out.

Replace those seals when you assemble it.


&gt;Hey,
&gt;
&gt;Trying to remove the head off my parts engine.  Using Bentley as a 
&gt;reference and go through the procedure but it didn't mention (or i missed 
&gt;it) about the tube thingys at the bottom.  There are three of them belove 
&gt;the valves that connect the head to the crankcase.
&gt;
&gt;What are those?  How do i get those off?
&gt;I think that's the only thing holding my head on.
