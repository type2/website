Subject: Bus Failure

My bus died this afternoon.  Everything was running fine until I negotiated
a speed bump and it simply died. The starter is working, battery is good, I
suspect fuel starvation. I towed it home. Wondering where to begin
trouble-shooting. The engine was rebuilt 9K miles ago and has run flawless.
I have a stock 2.0L engine with FI. Has this happened to another list
member? Any suggestions? 

I'm a digest reader so could you send any suggestions directly to my Email
address. Thanks
