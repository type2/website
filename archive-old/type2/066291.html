&gt;I recently purchased this once-upon-a-time radically customed show truck.
&gt;It's not so radical anymore! Anyway I found an VIN tag laying in the dash

Well, thats what happens when people do these wacky mods: its sano for 2
months, then its out of style.  I have 2 words for you: &quot;Bell Bottoms&quot;

&gt;shelf. This is not the plain tag with the model number and colour, that's
&gt;on the cab wall behind the seat where it belongs. This is the punched tag
&gt;with &quot;Volkswagenwerk GmbH&quot; across the top and &quot;MADE IN WEST GERMANY&quot;
&gt;across the bottom. Where was this originally mounted!?

This tag goes in the engine compartment, on the right side, on the vertical
piece to the right of the engine, right by where the battery cable goes
thru.  There should be a companion tag in there with the VIN on it.
