Subject: Re: [T2] LOUD FUEL PUMP?

You need to check the pressure on the pump, let the pump run for fifteen
or twenty minutes under pressure.
Watch for pressure drops and feel the pump for overheating.
Also check your fuel pressure regulator relief pressure, the numbers are
in Hayes and Bentleys.
I've never had a pump work properly that dropped below 32 Psi.
I've seen noisy pumps run for several years before they finally quit but
a spare is definitely called for if your making distant trips.
