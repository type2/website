&gt;Yes, there is a slight improvement in torque with the 88mm jugs.

&gt;Your engine is actually a 1584.  Going from 85.5 to 88.0 jugs gives a 4.5%
&gt;increase in displacement. ( '1600' to 1641 is only 3%.)
&gt;
&gt;But don't bother.  
&gt;
&gt;The 88mm 'slipper-skirt' jugs have a poor long-term performance history,

Using slip-in 87 mm pistons/cylinders gives a diplacement of 1641 cc's with
no loss in reliability.  Slip-in 88's are another story.  With 88's the
displacement becomes 1679 cc's and durability is poor.
