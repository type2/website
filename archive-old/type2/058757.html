Fellow Listees,

While checking my &quot;new&quot; '68 bus, I noticed that the bolts (?) going through
the engine bearer into the engine itself were missing.  Upon closer
inspection, they have broken off in the engine case.  On top of this, the left
one was put in using helicoil threads.  While researching this in the
archives, I came across something called a &quot;Busmount Engine Adaptor&quot; - Bugpack
part # 4538.  Is this something to convert other engines to a bus?  Can I use
this to somehow attach the engine to the bearer?  Also, does anybody know what
size the missing/broken bolts are?  Finally, what are my chances trying to
remove the bolt broken off with the helocoil threads?

Thanks!!
