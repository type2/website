Subject: ADMIN: Archives are back online.

All,

The mailing list archives for Type2 and Vintagebus are back online at
http://www.type2_dot_com/archives/index.html .  They both contain messages
through June 2001, when our old server started to have serious
connectivity problems.  We have the messages from June 2001 right up
to the one before this one; I just haven't put them all in the search
database yet.  After I get those in I will work on having the archives
automagically update themselves every night or so with that day's
posts.

Please let me know if you have any trouble with the archives or have
any questions about them.  Thanks!

Matt Roberds
