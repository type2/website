Subject: Re: Tachometer help needed /pix

Christopher-

I'm not an expert, but I'd suggest you go to the
Stewart Warner web site - http://www.stewartwarner_dot_com
check the tech/faq section and ping the tech email/phone POC info.

By the way it *looks*, my guess would be the
white = ground
black = coil signal
plug in middle = light bulb source

Never heard anything on SW's tech ... no way could
they be as good as Autometer, and I'm sure this list
will say VDO or bust ... YMMV.

Good luck, Aloha,

&gt; 
&gt; No replies so far.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts on how to hook this tach up, or just to test and 
&gt; see if it 
&gt; works?
&gt; 
&gt; Christopher
&gt; 
&gt; Never owned a tach before, and one was in the blank clock spot when
&gt; I got the bus, but never worked or was never connected.
&gt; 
&gt; There seem to be only two wires coming out of it, what do these hook up
to?
&gt; I would guess one to a ground and one to the coil maybe?
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a picture of the tach I have :
