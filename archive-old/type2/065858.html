Hi folks,

Well, I took the splitty plunge.  A couple weeks ago I responded to an ad
for a '67 camper for $750 in the local paper.  Splits are sorta hard to find
in these parts, so I decided I should take a quick look before it
disappeared.  Thanks to the Neato webpage I was able to decode that it is
actually a '67 Type 24 blue/white 13 window sunroof deluxe that someone went
through great pains to make look like an original westy.  It has a full
westy interior (passenger side rear cabinet custom modified so you can see
out the side windows) with 4 jalousy windows (cargo doors have popout
windows) and the submarine hatch/wood headliner. Of course it has the deluxe
exterior trim and a perfect white dash (no radio hole hacks!) with
clock/ashtray.  I guess you could call it a deluxe westy!

Of course there's bad news--It has rocker rust and needs jackpoints all
round (looks like I'll finally have a good use for my mig welder!).  The
other drawback is the spring plates have been cut up since the DPO intended
to install a bug transmission and eliminate the reduction boxes.  I've
located a pair of spring plates locally and I plan on installing them by the
weekend.  The good news is I talked the guy down to $500, but for that price
he decided to keep the Southwind gas heater (which for some reason he felt
was worth $500 alone ??!!!). The saving grace is that the main rails, most
of the floor and front suspension are very solid and the body (including the
nose) is straight and has minimal rust aside from the rockers.  It came with
some new sheetmetal panels--2 inner rockers and an outer rocker.

I took delivery of it this weekend, and since I don't yet have the spring
plates, I spent yesterday removing the oxidized paint and then
buffing/waxing the body and cleaning the interior.  The original aqua-blue
is a nice color.  Now it won't be so much an eyesore for the neighbors
(though to certain people, I suppose any condition bus is an eyesore).  

I hope to get it up on all fours soon.  After installing the spring plates
I'll be scrutinizing the allegedly good bug transmission that came with the
bus (the orig. bus trans. is included but it pops out of fourth).  From what
I understand, I'll have to reverse the ring gear to make the bug
transmission work with the reduction boxes--any tips here would be appreciated!

Looks like my weekends are booked for awhile!
