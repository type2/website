Yeah, the Alzheimer's must be hitting me early.  Can't remember who it was but it was a beautiful Splitty that was most of the way restored less engine.  Too bad it's not yours!  Or mine.  Cheers...KR

Mark, I think it was John Stiles that just listed a nice old splitty for
$900 that sounds like just what you need.  If it hasn't sold yet, maybe
he'll clue you in.  You didn't way where you are.  I think he was in the
Northeast.  And welcome back.  Cheers....KR
