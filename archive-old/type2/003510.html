Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 Fuel Injection timing
Date: Tue, 8 May 2001 18:03:56 -0700

The injectors are not timed to the firing order. Each time the points open,
all the injectors open. Only a 1/2 shot of fuel though. That way for each
combustion stroke [every other TDC] each cylinder gets 2 half shots of fuel
which equals a full shot. Unless you have injectors that are stuck open,
they are not flooding the engine. Look elsewhere, especially at the cold
start valve.
Unplug the single white wire going to the negative side of the coil. This is
the injector trigger signal. Try to start it. If it still floods, it is not
the injectors......they are not opening.

&gt; and I belive I have it timed  correctly, but everytime I turn the key it
&gt; tries to fire then floods itself out.  I wait a while it will try to fire
&gt; again then floods again.  HELP!!!!! I need to know if there is away to
make
&gt; sure the injectors coincide with the firing.
