&gt; Any remedy for saggy butt syndrome in a 1979 Westfalia? There does not
seem
&gt; to be a torsion bar adjustment in this year? Do they make adjustable air
shocks
&gt; for a '79? I see Chevy Astro Van 85+ recommended but for an older Westy.

If a poke with a sharp stick fails to produce
the intended effect, try adjusting the torsion bars
as described in the Bentley manual.
Air shocks will make the ride stiff.
Where did you get your information ???
