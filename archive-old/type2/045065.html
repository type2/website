Hi,

Concerning the D-jetronic.

I restored a 1970 Type 3 several years ago.  The manifold pressure sensor was over
$300 back then.  My Cosworth Vega also used a D-jetronic.  And I needed a pressure
sensor for it this year.  I ended up with rebuilt for a Porsche 914 for $359.  I did
a lot of research.  My application was discontinued many years ago, as is the Type
3.  Searching the Bosch buyers guide, I found a listing of available pressure
sensors for the D-jetronic injection.  Many european vehicles used them in the early
years.  There weren't many, 6 - 10 applications available and it appears they are
just selling off the inventory as most had warehouse as the availability. As I
remember, the cheapest was over $600.  I was looking for the closest match to the
operating conditions of my Cosworth.  4 cylinder, 2.0L, 7200 RPM redline.  The 2.0
liter, 4 cyl, 914 porsche was the close match.  However adjustment was required to
make it right.  I've learned that the metal diaphragms in the sensors fail by
cracking, allowing the vacuum to pass to atmosphere.  The intake track pulses of a 4
cylinder are especially hard on these.  The pulses are caused when the rushing
column of intake air, (velocity of around 300 fps) hits the intake valve immediately
after it closes and reflects back up the track.  6 and 8 cylinder engines still
effect the sensor, but they have more valves and each valve then has a lessor
effect.

Keep smiling,

Mike
