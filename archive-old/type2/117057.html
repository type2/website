Subject: Just bought my first T2b !

Congratulations on the new VW!  I'll tell you these vehicles will treat you
well if you take care of them.  Also I'd like to offer up the following bit
of advice to help you keep it running good:

- Keep it cool (don't push it harder than it wants to)
- Keep it filled with oil

Obviously this advice applies to all vehicles, but I cannot stress it
enough for Type2s.  Just take it easy and everything should go wonderfully.

:)

- Shawn.
