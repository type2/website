OK, I'll bite...

Why do you need to know this technique in Holland?  It was my understanding
that the highest point in the country was the top of a dike [ or perhaps a
windmill :) ].....

The method you describe used to be the standard procedure taught in public
school driver's education classes in Washington State, but then they
switched to automatic trans. training cars.

My daughter completed a private driver's ed. course this summer, and to my
amazement her textbook didn't even cover standard transmission vehicles and
how to drive them.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  ......In Holland this is a standard procedure that everyone taking a
driving test has to demonstrate (and fears!)......

.....The trick here is to use the e-brake not the normal brake pedal.....

Try it on a quiet hilly road and have fun mastering the art of driving
stick.  &lt;&lt;
