Hi all,

     I have a pinging problem on my 79 Std.  Stock 2.0l with all stock FI.
When I got it it was timed at the required mark of 7.5BTDC &amp; I was getting
pinging in 4th gear up some mild inclines.  It does not seem to be
overheating per the Muir dipstick test.  I checked the dwell &amp; made sure it
was set to 50 degrees &amp; re-timed at 7.5BTDC.  Still pinging.  Went back &amp;
timed it about 5BTDC &amp; it still pings.  This is my 13th VW &amp; I have never
had one ping when all was in spec.  Any ideas?  Thanks.

Pat Callaghan
79 STD.
