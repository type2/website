hey Mike, under the back seat is where VW put the battery in the type 1, 3
and thing.  In 1974 we did blow the doors off a bug when we charged a
battery with a bad cell, had the doors closed and somehow a spark went off
and man you should see what hydrogen gas can do to a small car!!  There
wasn't too much damage as there must not have too much hydrogen in the car.

Buy a cheap plastic battery box and be sure to strap it or better yet, bolt
it down.  In a fast stop, that battery is going to come flying forward
throwing acid and maybe even causing a fire, so clamp it GOOD!!!!

&gt; Or, I guess the other option I'm thinking of is to leave it on the side
&gt; and put a marine cover over the battery so the rain water doesn't drip
&gt; on the battery and also so battery acid can't get on the metal... but
&gt; still, I just HATE the location of the battery.  It's such a hassle to
&gt; get in and out and dealing with the cables, etc...
