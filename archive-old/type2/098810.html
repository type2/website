&gt; What seems strange to me, and a little funny, is that when these things

&gt;But what of the people who just drove these things?  Were there as many

It seems when you talk people who owned busses way back when that there are 
always stories of engines blowing up and leaving them stranded somewhere. Of 
course you have no way of knowing how those busses were maintained and/or 
driven. 
One aquaintance of mine has a 79 bus that he and his wife have owned since new. 
He told me that within the first year it suffered a dropped valve while his 
wife was trying to keep up with traffic on I-5. There were no gauges to warn of 
impending doom. The owner's manual for my 72 says the max crusing speed is 78mph
(which i have verified once or twice), nothing about driving gently to keep the 
engine from overheating. Of course that's assuming the owners ever even read 
the manuals or books such as Muir's idiot's guide. It's just a car like any 
other, get in and drive it, right?
