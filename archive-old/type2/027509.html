Friends,

Yesterday I installed the engine back into the bus. I had it out for the 
past few weeks getting it ready for the Minnesota trip. As I was tightening 
the sump plate nuts after putting in a new strainer, I noticed one wasnt 
getting tighter. Uh oh. At first I thought I had stripped the case, but 
further fiddling leads me to believe that I only stripped the nut. Well, 
thats good...but the problem is I cannot get the nut off the stud.

FYI: There is no clearance between the nut and the sump plate. I figured 
that might help you make a mental picture of the situation.

My father tells me there is some sort of cutting tool made specifically for 
this purpose, but I havent had any luck finding one around here. We have 
also discussed making relief cuts with a file so that we might break the nut 
in half (I wont go into all the details...).

So folks, Im pretty desperate right now. I am supposed to be leaving next 
Saturday or Sunday, and Im getting somewhat agitated by this whole nut 
fiasco. I found nothing in the Archives. Do any of you have any ideas? THANK 
YOU
