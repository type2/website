Subject: Adopt My Bus Please!!!

Hello Everyone--

Been a few weeks since I have written the list...I just completed a 
successful cross country journey from Florida to here in Santa Cruz 
California. I want to especially thank my friends in Houston and Tucson for 
helping me out along the way. I am in somewhat of a bind here in California 
because I am scheduled to leave for South Korea the end of the first week in 
April and I have no place to put my bus! So I wanted to try the list and see 
if there is anyone out there...that could adopt my bus for a year! I don't 
want to sell her...but if anyone perhaps has the space that I could park the 
bus for one year that would be great. I am located here in Santa Cruz 
California...however I am willing to travel to find a place to park the girl 
for a year. If anyone out there would be interested or has the resource to do 
such a thing that would be great....email me if interested or I can be 
reached at 831 345 0783--Thank you...

Adam Correa
