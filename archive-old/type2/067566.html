Subject: Fast Idle 75 Campmobile

Saturday night I left a party with my van running fine. Half way home the
engine was racing.  Checked the gas pedal and it seems fine.  I won't be
able to work on the bus until this Saturday.  Are there any cold weather
simptoms like the cable being stuck? I will check that and the pedal again.
 Then I will check the idle adjustment screw.  Possible vacum leak in the
distributor?  Last time this happened it was my gas pedal and when I
down shifted you could really here the difference in the engine. This time
that is not occurring so I think i have a different problem.  Maybe the
auxillary air regulator? Any help or past experience will be greatly
appreciated.
