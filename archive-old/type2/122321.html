&gt; Yesterday I posted a response to your e-mail
&gt; calling for the Casting Fool. I have not seen any posts from him lately but
&gt; the last I heard he was trying to get a hold of both of these boots to make
&gt; repros of them. He has made a bunch of other plastic and rubber pieces for
&gt; the type II and used to post quite often on this list.

Did he ever sell any parts? I saw the website with the pictures of the
reproduction parts but no news since and that was a long time ago.
