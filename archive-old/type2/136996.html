Subject: Re: [T2] Is a oil cooler a good idea ?

&gt; 1) How bad is the engine heat when driving in the desert in summer

This is the single worst set of driving conditions a bus can suffer. A 
company that rents old VW buses in Phoenix, I think, does not allow 
their buses to go to Death Valley in the summertime.

&gt; 2) I saw some oil cooler over internet for $250,

Even with an oil cooler the size of Montana, driving around Death 
Valley in the summer in a VW is a bad idea.

&gt; 3) Do you have any other tricks to cool down the engine like adding an 
&gt; extra fan  ?

Even an extra fan the size of Texas ... well, you get it by now.
