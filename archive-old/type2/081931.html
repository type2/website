&gt;The &quot;protrusion&quot; on the bottom of the shifter is a pin about an inch long
&gt;that goes thru the ball.
&gt;Remember that the pin has to be all the way forward.
&gt;The problem comes if it is at all back thru its hole.

The pin at the base of the shift lever also has another spring to provide tension
on the pin itself, which further complicates the reassembly.
The lever must be angled past the conical spring with constant tension and
fitted to the cup at this angle to complete the assembly in order for the pin to
fit the cup with it's other engaging spring.
