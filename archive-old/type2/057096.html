Subject: RE:  head removal

&gt;  Does anyone know if I can remove the passengers side 
&gt;head on a 78 westy while the motor is still in?

Yes, you can do it.  No, I would NOT recommend it!

In order to remove the head with the engine in place you have to remove
the alternator, fan, fan shroud, distributor, all sheet metal on the
front, rear, and drivers side, etc.  You'll spend a LOT more time
contorting your body into wierd shapes to get all the parts off than you
would if you just pulled your engine and did it right.  And bear this in
mind:  It's harder to put it all back together than to take it apart if
you try it that way!
