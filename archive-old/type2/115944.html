&gt; 
&gt; but mine was set up different. Mine went through the hole in the floor and
&gt; connected to both ends of the &quot;S&quot; shaped rod that hooks on to the bottom of
&gt; the pedal. At least I think that's what happened. All I have is a few coils
&gt; wrapped around both ends of this bracket indicating there used to be a spring
&gt; there.
&gt; 
&gt; So how is this supposed to be? Where does the spring in the above link hook on
&gt; to.  Maybe this is a dumb question, but I'm feeling pretty dumb, so if the
&gt; shoe fits.

There are several versions of the pedals afaik. 68-72 has one style of
linkage, 73-79 another. Within the last one, the pedal changed slightly in
76 and the pivot pin changed during a year I can't pin down.

Given all of this most of the vendors list all pedal components as 68-79
which is confusing.

I haven't seen a 70 pedal assembly at the junkyard in a while but I believe
it doesn't use that spring. That spring is used on the later assembly: one
end presses against the floor and the other end the the pedal. It wraps
around the middle of the pivot pin.

&gt; One last thing. I just got a Bentley the other day, so if all of this is in
&gt; there and I haven't found it yet, just tell me to clam up and pint me to where
&gt; it is in the book

Only the later model pedal is depicted in the FI section afaik.
