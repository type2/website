Subject: Re: [T2] Charcoal Canister

Is there any detrimental affects of not having a canister at all?
My '77 bus has the tank breather connected directly to the air box (where
the outlet to the canister would go).
The PO has replaced the fan shroud (type 4 motor) with one that doesn't have
the air out let to go to the canister, so I never bothered to fit one in.
