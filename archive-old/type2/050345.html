According to Bently, Chapter 5, Figure 16-8, the openings point down and to 
the right.

&gt; So, does anyone know off the top of their head:
&gt;  
&gt;  a) whether the metal &quot;baffles&quot; (for lack of a better word) on the gasket
&gt;   point up into the pedestal or down into the block
&gt;   (i seem to recall down into the block)
&gt;  
&gt;  b) which direction the )))) point in (left, i believe).
&gt;  
&gt;  I've got it on there, and it looks right, but I'd rather get
&gt;  it right first off and my bentley, which i'm assuming has this
&gt;  sort of info, still hasn't arrived in the mail.  *sigh*
