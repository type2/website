&gt; New issues.  I am interested in finding any documentation

I'm not sure exactly what you have in mind, but if you're interested in
the owner's manual and so forth, I own a '79 California Westy with the
manuals intact.  I'd be willing to mail you copies - just let me know.

&gt; I thought it was a deluxe, but it does
&gt; not have some of the things a deluxe apparently is supposed
&gt; to have, like
&gt; the center seat/console/trashcan holder.

If you've been reading recent posts, you'll know these are almost always
missing and almost impossible to find for sale.  Probably better to
resigning yourself to life without it.


&gt; It does have the one-legged table
&gt; that goes between the front seats on some versions, but it
&gt; does not have the
&gt; two devices mounted on the dash that the table clips to, so
&gt; the table is
&gt; useless????  Go figure.  I stopped in Hesperia, CA at a VW
&gt; junkyard (Chris'
&gt; VW) and crawled through about a dozen '77 and later Westys
&gt; and Vanagons, but
&gt; found none that had the clips for the table.

On my Westy, there are two additional brackets (identical to the ones
for the table) on the side of the seat pedestal near the seat belt
buckle.  These were for the center console thingy.  If they're still
there on yours, you can use 'em for the table, since your camp stoll
thingy is missing anyway!

&gt; The second battery is missing, but I am pretty sure that the
&gt; electrical
&gt; thing under the rear seat, drivers side, is the battery
&gt; charger.  Anybody
&gt; know where I can get pictures and/or drawings of what the physical and
&gt; electrical installation should be like?  I would like to
&gt; re-install the
&gt; second battery.

Can't help you there - sorry!

&gt; The refrigerator does not work, but Dometic was very kind and provided
&gt; documentation so I can get it serviced.  Our camper has a
&gt; Dometic model RC
&gt; 152, a top-loading refrigerator.  Is this a rare or common
&gt; model?

Common for the late model T2 Westies, AFAIK.

&gt; Anybody know of a particularly good place in Arizona or Southern
&gt; California to get
&gt; it serviced?

Sorry again - never had it done.

Cheers,
Alistair
