Subject: Pop-top seal problem

Well I finally replace my pop-top seal before I put my 76 westy in
storage last fall.  With last weeks unseasonably warm weather I decided
to charge the battery and take it for a drive to run the engine for a
while.  When I got home I noticed the wind had blow up under the luggage
rack and pushed the canvas out like a bubble on the inside of the bus.
I looked at the front of the luggage rack and there is about a 1/4 to
1/2 inch space between the actual roof of the bus and the seal that
wraps around the bottom to the pop-top.   I had the luggage rack off
last summer to clean it and put on the new seal.  Could I have possibly
put it on wrong?  Anyone ever experience this problem with new pop-top
seals?
Thanks,
Phillip
