Subject: Hybrid bus (was Re: [T2] Gross Polluters)

&gt;the hybrid design is
&gt;attractive.   consider
&gt;
&gt;a 1200 or 1300 vw engine, through a hybrid drive, driving a Bus 
at 70mph
&gt;all day????  I think it is doable...

But where does the extra power come from to run the electric 
motor &quot;all day&quot;?  Please don't say it will be generated by the 
1300 engine.  :)  I think hybrids are fantastic and will greatly 
improve around-town mileage with tricks like regenerative braking, 
non-idling engines and CVTs.  I don't see how they will help 
highway mileage on level ground much though.

I want a hybrid bus with a 1.6l TDI engine, four hub-mounted 12hp 
electric motors with regen and a 1Kwh NiMH battery pack.  Won't 
somebody make it please???  :)

-David
