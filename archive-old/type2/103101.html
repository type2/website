&gt;By the way, if you have FI, I though your fuel system should be designed to

&gt;pumps. So I thought they would suffer less fuel leaking problems than the
&gt;carb models??

A word of caution on FI systems. No problem on pressure build up because 
the pressure regulator will relieve all pressure above 35 lbs without 
vacuum, so no excess built up could happen, BUT, if you forget to hit the 
solinoid and start the engine and starve the pump a few times, you will 
kill your pump. A better cutoff for that situation would be an electric 
switch in the pump electric circuit.
