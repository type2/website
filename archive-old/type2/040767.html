Subject: Change Front Seal....adjust end play?
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;Does end play automatically have to be checked/adjusted, or should I be
&gt;able to reinstall the shims that were there and go with it?
&gt;The engine is an &quot;H&quot; case 1600 DP.

could this be an H series 1500 from a late 60s bug that's been adapted
for use as a 1600 on a bus? could be. Sometimes they leak from the oil
pump area because of the adaptor plate. Yours is a flywheel area leak
which means main seal and/or excessive endplay. Usually check the endplay
before removing the flywheel to see if it's excessive. At this point
replace the flywheel seal (red silicone) and find the 3 thickest shims
you can to replace the ones that came out. Measure the endplay per Muir.
If endplay is still excessive despite your thickest shims,it will continue
to leak.At that point you can drive it for a long time provided you stay
on top of the oil level at all times, or you can try having the case machined.
