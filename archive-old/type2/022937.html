&gt;I have a strange problem on my 82 westy. The oil light functions just
&gt;the way it is supposed to except it is very dim. It comes on with the
&gt;ignition key &amp; goes right out after I start but it is almost too dim to see
&gt;in the bright sunlight. I looked at the back of the instrument cluster but
&gt;did not see anything obvious wrong. Any ideas? Thnaks.

My advice would be to check the voltage at the light when it is on, and see 
what it reads. It should be 12 volts. If it is less then that then check 
the voltage at the battery. If the voltage there is 12V+ then it is 
probably the hot wire that runs from the back to the front that has too 
much resistance, and so your whole instrument panel has not enough voltage. 
I would expect that your battery light would come on if this is the case, 
but you never can tell. Regardless, a voltmeter is your friend.
