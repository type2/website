Dean,

Back to basics....

If you didn't touch the distributor, then leave it alone for now.


Got spark?...at the spark plug end
Got gas?
Got air?

what year/engine?  carb? fi?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello List,
&gt; 
&gt;     I sent a message asking for help on my engine.  I had pulled the
&gt; engine to change the clutch.  After putting it back in and reconnecting
&gt; everything, the engine wasn't firing.  So reconnected everything and
&gt; still no fire.  Everyone that responded to my email, told me to check
&gt; the wiring and also that I need to crank the engine to TDC.   When I
&gt; pulled the engine I didn't remove the distributor.  So should I remove
&gt; the distributor now and crank the engine to TDC then replace the
&gt; distributor.  Or should I just make sure the the rotor is firing in the
&gt; correct order when I crank the engine to TDC.   I am going to remove the
&gt; distributor cover tonight and hand crank the engine to TDC.  I just want
&gt; to make sure I am doing this process correctly.
