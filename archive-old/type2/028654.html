Got my '77 bus running today with a trip to the junk yard and to the local
auto parts store.  My '77 bus has fuel injection and the air flow meter was
damaged.  I went to the junk yard and found a air flow module that was
physically the same but part number was different.  This AFM from the junk
yard probably came from a Vanagon or something else I am not sure but the
pinout numbers were the same on the outside.  However when I started the bus
up it would idle but environmentally it polluted the atmosphere with much
unburnt gas or oil.

My question is should I try to find another AFM or should I just open this
one and utilize the screw adjustment inside to attempt to get the mixture
more acurrate?  Note the timing and point gaps have been set to the best of
my ability.

On a slightly different note.  I found that if the engine will start but is
unable to idle.  It is a good idea to check the vacuum lines on this
particular engine.  I found the vacuum line that is attached near the
throttle assembly had a severe leak.  I assume that this leak prevented the
vacuum diaphram on the distributor to function correctly thus preventing the
car from idling.
