&gt; Hello list
&gt; 
&gt; I have a question about a 1973 dash for my bus. My
&gt; Dash board is padded of course, but the padded vinyl
&gt; cover is beyond repair. My question is, can I pull
&gt; this cover off and just prime and paint the metal
&gt; underneath? I have seen earlier model busses with
&gt; painted metal dash boards and i was wondering if the
&gt; late model bus dash boards were basically the same
&gt; except with a padded vinyl cover on it. has any one
&gt; tried this before? Thanks!

That might be possible, but I don't know if they made any mods to the
metal before they put the foam and vinyl on it.  I do know that under the
vinyl dash of a '69 bug lies a perfect metal dash, but in this case the
vinyl dash simply unbolts from the metal.  The bus isn't built that way.
