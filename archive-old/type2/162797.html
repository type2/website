Subject: Q about vacuum line with SVDA

My question is about the vacuum lines from the SVDA. Does there *Need* to=
be a tee and have a hose to the air cleaner? I swapped from a 009 recent=
ly and the connection on the air cleaner (other than the one going to the=
charcoal canister) was taped off. So hence we didn't run a vacuum line t=
o it and it is still just taped off. What are the consequences of just le=
aving it as is? Is that line necessary?

Thanks,

Meg
