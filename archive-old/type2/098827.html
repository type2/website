Subject: Re: [T2] Smog and EGR [passed]More Advice

LMAO! that's what i get for skippin posts because the subject title
doesnt apply to me! i miss some FUNNY stuff! tofu grit? oh that was
hilarious! i made some AWESOME tofu and veggie enchiladas... yum yum!!!

billy, &quot;ich'in&quot; is the southern way of pronouncing &quot;itching&quot;, which is
the southern way of saying &quot;they want to do something so bad, they can
hardly stand it&quot;. ok, that is a rough translation, but i dont think there
is an easy way to explain why someone would itch because they were
excited, lol. &lt;just checked more mail and see you might make tofu chili
for BBB... I CANT WAIT! i was thinking of trying to find a recipe and
make some, too. now i dont have to!&gt;

as far as smog regulations, here in OK they have done away with yearly
inspections(though it was never JUST emmissions) and the increase of
nasty junkers driving around billowing toxic waste out their tailpipes
has risen beyond belief! nasty for me and my kids to breathe and HORRIBLE
to the environment! ACK!

waving my finger at the nasty ford dumping pollution in front of me and
at the people behind me for honking cuz i am staying 3 car lengths away
from it,
