Subject: hard to replace exhaust?

just bought bus, one thing knocked back on roadworthy certicifcate 
for was exhaust.

Fairly rusty in larger part and then pipe at end is crumbling away. 
Do i have to replace whole exhaust? If yes, i guess it involves 
welding so it will have to be done by some professional? i have 
basic welding skills though, and are short of cash.

help!
