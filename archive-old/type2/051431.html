&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt; Completed the installation of my rebuilt trans and it sure sounds
&gt; better than the old one!
&gt; 
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Can anybody offer any thoughts on how to get this right?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA.

Tom:
Early Vanagons 80-81 (?) had the rear shift rod support, (the bolt with
a plastic band around the head that goes inside the rear shift rod and
bolts through the intermediate plate of the transmission) constructed as
an eccentric. Get underneath, loosen the nut with a 17mm (or is it 19mm)
boxed end wrench while holding the flats on the shank with a 13mm open
end. Just loosen it enough to rotate the bolt somewhat. The shank of the
bracket and the threaded part are slightly eccentric. Just turn it 1/4
to 1/2 turn and observe its movement. Get out and see if you've got it.
A couple of tries should get it. Unfortunately those of us who were
foolish enough to require a replacement part do not have the luxury of
this adjustment. The corollary of this lesson is to always undo this
bracket when removing the engine whilst leaving the  transmission in
place. It is not sufficiently stout to support the transmission (trust
me).
