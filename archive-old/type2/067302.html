&gt; actual drag itself is quite large.  In order to lower the gross or actual
&gt; drag yet retain the interior volume you would have to use a shape such as
&gt; found on, for example, the Toyota Previa wagon or similar.

Exactly Bob fails to highlight enough that although Cd is a
wonderfully nondimensionalized measure, to figure your actual
total drag, you are going to have to multiply it by surface
area again, which like the origional brick, is way way too much.
Hence even if the 928 has a .31 or .35 your bus is still SOL even
if you swapped in that 250+ hp S4 mill.

This all brings me to a fancifull and farfetched idea I've
been having though, say one (without saddle gas tanks) were
to form out of sheet metal, belly pans shaped like inverse
airfoils for insertion between the frame rails on a bus,
anybody think you might get enough downforce to improve handling.
Probably not as most low speed benefit would be ground effect and
you would be too far from the ground, but would sure look neat
anyway.

And for any budding aero engineers out there, why do golf balls
have dimples and what is the perfect airfoil shape in an ideal
frictionless society.
