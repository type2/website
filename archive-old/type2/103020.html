Subject: Re: [T2] Front door key code

--Provided all your locks are keyed alike, you can find it on any of them. 

I think one of the easiest is the rear hatch lock.

Also on the slider door is easy.

I got codes from both when I bought my 79 deluxe with no keys.

I would like to get new keys
cut.  However, after searching the archives I am still unclear as to where on the handle the key code is located?
