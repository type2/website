Subject: altitude compensation /thanks

first off, thanks to all that offered suggest for getting
the van to like the thinner air.
 
between their advice and the archives, I was able to piece together
the obvious for myself.

1. The spring in the AFM can be adjusted to compensate for altitude.

2. Adjusting the spring is the hard way, let the altitude compensation
circuit
do the work

3. Most (?) FI harnesses have 2 unused plugs that are for the altitude
compensation
circuit. These go to pins 9 and 12 on the ECU. the schematics also show
a connection
to pin 6, but 6 is just a ground. 

4. So, I intend to wire a rheostat into the circuit and adjust it until
I have &quot;super go power&quot;.
 
5. Timing can be advanced. This is hard to adjust while a person is
driving,though.

All in all, it appears to be not such a big deal at all. I'm sure my
optimism will be tempered
by trying to implement the system tomorrow, but until then, I'm all
smiles.
 
I hope this presents a very trivial summary of what has been, for me, a
bit
of a stretch to put together.
