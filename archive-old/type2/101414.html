&gt; And opening for him will be Don McClean singing a one and a half hour
&gt; version of &quot;American Pie&quot;...?-)
&gt; Not knockin' either one, but I wonder if they both walk out on stage
&gt; thinkin', &quot;Just this one more time, then I'm gonna suicide right on
&gt; the stage...&quot;

  I saw Harry Belafonte at the Taos Solarfest (it was great!) and he said,
just before singing &quot;Day-O&quot; for the ten millionth time, &quot;Don't ever sing a
song that you don't really, really love, because if you do, THAT song will
inevitably become the one that sells a million copies, and that you are
obliged to sing for the REST OF YOUR LIFE...  No, really, I love this
song...&quot;
  The price of celebrity.  But I caught Arlo a couple years ago, and he
still sings it like he loves it, so I guess that's okay.  Wish I could get
to the show, but my mandatory aircooled bus content is too slow for a trip
to OK!  Happy friday all!

PS- sorry for the bad P/N a couple days ago.  Just sticking my foot in mouth
trying to be helpful.  That number was, indeed, the lens only.  I'll shut up
until I have something accurate to say...
