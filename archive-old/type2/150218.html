Subject: Re: [T2] 78 2.0 transplant into a 74 westy

Hi John,

Putting the 2.0L engine  on a 3-rib is no problem as long as you swap  
the 210/215 flywheel over to the new engine.

It's when you swap the tranny (6 rib swapped for 3/5) that the  
shifter length issues come up.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; get the shift stick to work right.
