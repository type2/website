&gt; I have teh Weld-Pak 100 along with the gas setup. it has served me well on
&gt; my Bus. will do anything I've asked it to do and seems to have pretty good
&gt; control for an inexpensive welder.  wouldn't want to use it in production
&gt; work, have had to stop once or twice to let it cool down but nothing
&gt; serious.   think I paid around $250 or so for it +the gas setup etc. was
&gt; close to $500 in the garage welding.

&gt;    From what I've gathered from a web search, the 3200 is the 100 with
the gas set up...$459 at HD...Sadly, the local welder's supply house wants
$650 for the same set up, but in two boxes...I asked 'em if they'd take $500
but they declined my offer...;-(
I put up a flier at the supply house but all I got were offers for very used
220v
units and a &quot;really good deal&quot; on a welder and trailer (in case I wanted to
go
into bridge repair... ;-(
Yeah, I know about the ones at Harbor Freight...But even if everything &quot;will&quot;
be Chinese made, I'd like to give us locals a chance at keeping their jobs...
BTW, keep an eye on Milwaukee Tools...Good chance they may be moving to
the East, since they've been bought by the same big conglomerate that runs
the Ridgid woodworking tools... ;-(
