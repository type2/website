It works by applying solvents to the plastic to make it more pliable.  In
order for these solvents to work they have to be more volitile than the
solvents already in the plastic.  Armor-all leaches out the existing
solvents and replaces them with its own solvents that then evaporate,
leaving the plastic brittle.

AA works fine if you use it forever at regular intervals, but the first
time you use it your are committed!
