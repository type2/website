To All:

I departed the States on the eleventh, returned last night (the 24th).  Had a
nice run down to Cabo despite the hurricane, engine problems and other minor
ills.  Near the Cape I ran into flooded vados and washed-out roads, managing
to get the bus stuck in one of them, which also swallowed a Coca-Cola truck
and assortment of pick-ups.  Fortunately the engine kept running and I
managed to work the bus free under her own power.

  2,366 miles traveled in 63.1 engine hours.  I'll upload the trip-log as
soon as I've edited the lies into some sort of order :-)

PS.  San Diego to Inuvik to Cabo San Lucas and back to San Diego: 10,677
miles.
