Subject: FS: '59 7 door panel, '79 $300 Sacto

Couple of interesting busses spotted in Friday's Sacto Bee paper.
So sue me, I look at the leftover papers at work, but at least I 
look!

'59 Bus, 7 door panel, 6V, 36 hp, split case $2800
916-483-4250

'79 Bus, all complete, clean, no motor $300
916-723-7245 after 6pm PST

Again, lots of other busses, will post if specific interest shown,
apparent *good* deals, or unusual finds.

Insert legal blah blah here or elsewhere, don't know 'em, just read 'em.
