Subject: 1976 Westfala Camper For sale

Hey all,
 I received these messages from a guy who wants to sell his bus. It is
located halfway across the country from me so I don't really have any use
for it.
Thought I would pass it on.

Subject: 1976 Westfala Camper


I have a camper with pop-up top.  It was left here by my Son's
ex-girlfriend.  Rather than pay the rather large storage bill (over five
years) and go to the trouble of hauling it off, she gave me the title.  It
appears to be complete (including stove, sink, bed, propane bottle, etc.)
and in fair shape except it has dropped an exhaust valve.  It is an 1976
model.  Vin # 2362092466.  I would like to get it off my property.  I would
be open to offers.  My home phone 918-534-3563
Thanks
Lamont

Hello,
I live in Bartlesville, OK.  Sometime back (before I had the title) I was
offered $1000.  The camper has deteriorated a little since then (that was
about three years ago)and I would like to get it off my property so I would
be open to any reasonable offer.  I really not sure what the camper is
worth.
Sorry I am late in getting back with you, my computer at home is down.
Thanks,
Lamont
