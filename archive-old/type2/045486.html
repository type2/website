&gt; Can I take the Disc brakes off the Super and put them on the bus if not
&gt; will they go on the sunbug (std beetle)

You have disc brakes on your Super? I can assure you that it didn't come
that way! And further assure you that they won't fit (SB has 15&quot; tires; bus
has 14&quot; ones). They probably won't go on the standard bug either; the
suspensions on SB and standard beetles are different.

Of course, you *can* get them to fit, but if you do, buy a plane ticket to
Charlotte, NC; there are lots of NASCAR shops who would love to have someone
who can do that kind of reengineering job.

&gt; I pulled the engine from the super beetle (75 or 76) and put it in the
&gt; bus.  It had an alternator on it.  I couldn't figure out the wiring on
&gt; it so I put the old gen on it.  I would prefer the alternator.  It is
&gt; the same as the one on my bug but different from the ones I have seen.
&gt; Most I see have posts similar to a gen but this one has a round plug
&gt; harness on the top.  After that I don't know where to turn for help I
&gt; really would rather have the alt

Get an orange Bentley bug manual; it's got the wiring diagram for that
alternator.
