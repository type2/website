Subject: Re: [T2] Kingman to Laughlin, then up to Death Valley??

&gt; 1) Where have people stayed in Laughlin that was reasonably priced (up to 90 bucks a night) that was nice?
&gt;

My last trip I stayed at the Edgewater. $20 a night. Just make sure
you DEMAND a non-smoking room (unless you smoke, of course).

The rooms were clean and large. The river is right outside the
building. If you have kids, the arcade is the best in the area.
Harrah's arcade is bigger, but poorly maintained and the employees are
churlish and lazy.
