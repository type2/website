Subject: Gas Tank reinstall, one wire left over

I blasted away the tag I'd put on the grounding wire to my gas tank when I
power washed the engine compartment, so.... I have a couple of dangling
wires.

Today's mystery is:  where does the green grounding wire attach in the tank
compartment?  To  one of the fastening bolts on the sending unit?  The tank
is covered in mystic goo to rustproof it forever, so if there was a
supplementary stud on the tank, it's unfindable.  Thanks much.
