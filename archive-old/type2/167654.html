&gt; &gt; I have always wanted to adapt a VW TDI to a 78 camper. Will this engine rotate the proper

&gt;
&gt; Yes.
&gt;
&gt; I wonder if Mr Kennedy makes an adapter for the TDI engine?
&gt;
&gt; Yes he does.  TDI in a late bay has been done in Germany, but I'm not
&gt; sure if there are any in the US.  There are a couple in Vanagons.

now finding a type two engine is another matter. they are not currently
being imported, and every TDI avaliable is going at record prices.
