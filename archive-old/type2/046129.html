don't take that as a blanket recommendation!  I do parallel small
gel-cells with the battery in my bus to charge them, but this is my
experience only and does not guarantee success.

Most gel-cells have specific charging specifications printed on the side
of the battery.  Get out a multimeter and make sure that the charging
voltage and current do not exceed the stated values.  If they don't, you
should be fine!
