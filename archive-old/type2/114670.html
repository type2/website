&gt;I think I know this weird little item. But I am not

&gt;rubberplug. The wire ends at the spot where the engine

&gt;Perhaps it's usefull when you need to know the amount
&gt;of revs it makes per minute? Although I would say it
&gt;might be easier to measure it on the ignition.

Look at current track 63. It's called the TDC market unit and it must have been used by the dealers to accurately check the timing. I'd like to wire it up to a scope one day along with a connection to pin 1 on the ECU, measure the phase between the two signals and then compare it to a light shining on the timing scale.
