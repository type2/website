Subject: Re: [T2] canvas clearout

my sewing machine is a new one, but i believe it said it would do
&gt;upholstery.

more than likely.....most machines mfg.say they will do alot more than they 
can really do a good job of. you will need to use thread designed for the 
type of stuff you are wanting to sew. most of this type of thread is much to 
big for a domestic (home,portable) machine to use without serious 
modifacations. (ymmv)

i think this stuff is thin enough that i should be able to
&gt;sew it on my own machine... if not, i work at an upholstery shop and i
&gt;can use those machines. unfortunately, they are belt driven, but they are
&gt;old cast iron industrial strength singers... it skips a step every once
&gt;in a while, but it sews through many layers of vinyl and padding when
&gt;necessary so think this stuff will be easy. i also have an old cast iron
&gt;singer, myself, but i cant always make it work properly. how much do you
&gt;know about adjusting these damned things?

if you can give me the model numbers of these &quot;old cast iron singers&quot; i can 
possabaly provide you with repair manuals and parts books for these 
machines. my sister also lives in okc i get up there every now and then, and 
could take a look at them for you.

&gt;nothing there!
