Maritza Cardona sends:

&gt; 1. Replace a few panels/bodywork
&gt; 2. interior (minor work)
&gt; 3. New window rubber
&gt; 4. paint

Do the bodywork first, then strip the interior out of it. If there is a
plywood floor in your Bus, get it out of there. If your Bus is like my Bus
you will be amazed at all of the rust that's under that wood.

Then remove the glass and paint the Bus. Finally, put it back together. I
would say glass first, then the interior. (This way, if you have to leave
the bus in the auto craft shop's holding pen, you won't get your new
interior rained on.
