Subject: BA-6 Heater Relay Needed

Anyone parting out a later-model bay that once had the BA-6 heater, I'm
looking for a heater relay that I believe installs under the dash. This is
the only electrical part I'm missing from my BA-6 heater, which I hope to
install before the onset of our 2 weeks of winter here in Memphis, TN
(usually around January 15). ;)

Seriously, I'd love to get this part, if anyone comes across it. I don't
have a part number though. It is shown in the far left section of a tif
image at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/eber/eb-003.tif and labeled simply
&quot;Heater Relay with ballast resistor for air circulation blower.&quot;

I'd also be quite happy for information on aftermarket replacements for
this part if they exist.

Thanks! Joe
