Subject: Re: [T2] The Perfect Body (Metal)

&gt; Anyway, a local (yokel?) said &quot;just heat that up red hot and splash some
&gt; water on it, the metal will shrink back to its old size&quot;

&gt; Anyway, has anyone else ever done this? Is it (ill) advised?

Jeremy, this is a traditional way of shrinking metal.  It is not quite so
slapdash.  You heat a small spot in the center of the stretch until dull
red, then quench, then work in circles outward.  I'll confess I have not
mastered this, but good metal guys tell me this is the way to do it.

I think you also have to be realistic about how much shrinkage you can hope
for.  if the damage is real serious, you'd be better to cut and patch.

Regards,

Grant
