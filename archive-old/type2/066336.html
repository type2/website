&gt; Has anyone had trouble with oil leaking from the dipstick tube after

&gt; 
&gt; The new dipstick doesn't have a metal &quot;cup&quot; that covers the end of the
&gt; dipstick tube like the stock dipstick does.  Instead, there's a dense
&gt; cotton disk that butts up against the end of the tube. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any problems with oil leaking from this setup?

I've been using this setup on my 1800 T4 for about 4 years with no 
problems.  The dense cotton disk has become oil soaked but there's been 
no evidence of oil leakage.
