In my 71 bus I used a dial gauge metal lab thermometer, very accurate,
safe to use, and came long enough to reach the sump.  No idea what
happened to it.  For spot reading, the metal mesh encased TAYLOR brand
oven thermometer (yes, you can feed it into 400 deg) is a good chloice
if you carefully straighten the bend; I put one end in a vise, then used
a small diameter pipe over the other end to carfully pull it sraight
without kinks.  Since it uses a mini-mini plug for the sensor, you could
make a permanent version by epoxying on a brass tube to encase the mesh
(in case oil gets in there), and solder on a stop to the brass tube so
it hangs in the right distance.  The get thee to Radio Shack and buy a
mini-mini jack, some dual wire (coax style or house wiring style) and a
female mini-mini jack.  This lets you keep the gauge up front and run
the wire under the carpet, through a hole behind your seat, along the
floor or Westy cabinet, and through another hole next to the spare tire
well.  This gauge BTW even has an alarm when a present temperature is
reached!    MB 78 Westy 227k mi
