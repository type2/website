 IIRC, I should see the #1 intake closing as I
 approach TDC then the #1 exhaust opening as I
 continue turning the engine over, correct?  Same for
 #2 except with BDC?  (Both to be cross-ref'd with
 verified with the location of the distributor
 rotor/wires, of course)
 
------------------------------------------------------

A better way to find #1 TDC:

Remove the 3/4 valve cover and watch # valves.
Turn engine in the direction of rotation. Watch the
exhaust valve [end valve]. It will open and then
close. JUST as it closes, the intake will start to
move. STOP, when the exhaust and the intake rock back
and forth as you move the crank back and forth, this
is the point of rocking. Look at your timing mark on
the pully, it should be on zero. Look at your dist
rotor, it will be pointing to #1 to FIRE. If not, move
your plug wires to match.
