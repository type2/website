So I'm driving home from Wisconsin when the engine starts running rough.  I don't have the right toolswith me, but I DO have the timing light I picked up at Trak Auto on the way out of town - run around back and find the idling engine is running about 4deg BTDC, rather than 7.5deg.  By the time I get home it's backfiring and sputtering.  I find that the points are out of adjustment, but when I try to adjust them the mounting screw strips out.  I put a little JB Weld in the hole and I go buy a fresh screw of the same size.  I get it adjusted for a few minutes, it gets rough again, and when I re-adjust it strips out again.

So my long-winded question is what are my options?  Do I need to replace the whole distributor just to fasten down the points?  Can I replace just that moving plate?  Does a hall sensor replace the points, and would that be a better solution?  I don't have a lot of free time at the moment, so if I can't fix it easily I may just tow it to the local mechanic.

Thanks in advance,
