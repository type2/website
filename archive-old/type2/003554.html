Subject: Flower power stickers and another question

Last month people were asking where to get flower power magnet stickers.

Check out the July 2001 Hot VWs pg 120 bottom right of the page.

But as your looking at the bus with the magnets on it.  Look to the left of
the gas tank.  What is that???

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy

If you are going to walk on thin ice,
you may as well Dance...
