We've never dyed our actual curtains, but if you want to dye them.  I would 
suggest Rit dye.  It works well with most fabrics.  But you must leave them 
soak in it for quite a while.  We are going to get a cool surf print and have 
new curtains made.  They are fairly simple to make new ones.  We made some 
temporary ones out of some white fabric and dyed them with Rit dye, so we had 
something to cover the windows for Daytona Bike Week.  Some of our friends 
had curtains made from a red tie dyed fabric and they look great.  Just a 
suggestion, check out the local fabric stores.
