&gt; How do you locate and hold the nut on the top bolt of a defective starter,
&gt; it's a '78 Microbus. The starter is held by a bolt at the top and a stud
&gt; and nut at the bottom. The bolt head is not hexagonal, it is circular with
&gt; a flat part of the head which engages in a recess in the starter mounting
&gt; frame. Access to the nut on the engine side is between the fan housing and
&gt; the bulkhead in the engine compartment? How do you get to it? Do you have
&gt; to take off any tin? Can't seem to identify it from the engine side.

I generally access this bolt from the top.
open engine compartment access hatch.
remove air cleaner.
get open end metric wrench 
get needle nose pliers
crawl under bus
push bolt all the way thru
lay on rear deck with head thru engine hatch, works better feet towards
                                   windshield
next to fuel presure regulator is (should be) bolt sticking out.
hold out with needle nose pliers near base
put on nut, screw down hand tight
while pulling out with pliers tighten with wrench
