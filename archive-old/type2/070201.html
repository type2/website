Subject: Re: Tool storage locations

Uh, on a reality note, my tool box is worth about 8 times what my bus would 
cost to replace. 

But, all kidding aside, is it safe to mount a tool box in the engine compart-
ment?  Why or why not?

rvanness} &gt;I thought about that too, Ron, but opted for further up front due to fire

rvanness} 'cause I ain't putting any more sweat and love into a VW bus, nosir! ;)
rvanness} Well, unless it's a nice splitty westy or a doublecab or...
rvanness} 
rvanness} &gt;I do check and maintain good fuel lines and connections, but the hazard
rvanness} &gt;still exists. With the box, I can lug it around to wherever I need it (as

rvanness} Maybe we could install ejection compartments so we could eject the tools at
rvanness} the first sign of fire?  Or engine release thrusters to shoot that burning
rvanness} magnesium clear of the chassis.  In any event, I don't think I'll be in the
rvanness} frame of mind to worry about saving the tools--the rescue squad will
rvanness} probably have to pull me out of the bus as I ramble out tune-up specs and
rvanness} m-codes!
