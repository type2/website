Subject: Re: [T2] German Transaxle of America?

Hiya Duke,

I cannot even begin to say enough good things about German Transaxle and 
especially about Ken Harvey who owns the place.  He is a real class guy in my 
book.  Better yet, he knows what he's doing and he has a well trained staff.

I had to have my AutoStick rebuilt a couple of years ago.  For those of you 
who are unfamiliar with the AutoStick, just let me say that finding anybody to 
work on them (let alone a competent and conscientious facility) is difficult.  
German did a perfect job on my AutoStick.  It has run like the proverbial 
Swiss watch ever since.  While doing the rebuild on my transaxle Ken walked me 
through the assembly with one of his techs.  No corners cut, anything that 
looked remotely suspicious was replaced.  It's no wonder that most of the VW 
oriented shops in the Willamette Valley defer any transaxle work to Ken.

Definitely the way to go!

Mike
