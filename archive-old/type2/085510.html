Subject: Re: [T2] what market? (long)

Hi Greg,

Wow; what a strange setup.

I would be interested to know what the M-code says; it will tell you where
and when it was manufactured and where is was intended to be delivered. You
can look up the m-code locations in the library at type2_dot_com


Happy trails,

&gt; Hello group, I'm new to the list and have just bought a '74 single cab
&gt; which appears to be in completely original condition.  In the past I've
&gt; owned a 73 bus and a  74 bus and this truck is a little different from both
&gt; of them, so I'm wondering what market it was originally intended for.
&gt; 
&gt; The truck has no front parking lights.  The front turn signals are, like
&gt; the bus, just below the windshield but are single filament bulbs with only
&gt; single contacts in the bulb receptacle.
&gt; Also, the truck has no back-up lights.  It has the long amber, red and
&gt; white lenses but at the bottom where the reverse lights should be, there
&gt; are just empty sockets, with NO electrical wires going to it and no
&gt; electrical contact in the sockets.  The rear turn signals and brake lights
&gt; are just like the 73 and 74 bus I had.
&gt; 
&gt; The truck has a type IV engine but has no seatbelts.  This appears to be
&gt; this way from the factory.  All the plastic screws are in place where
&gt; seatbelts would mount but this truck has no belts!
&gt; 
&gt; My question is:  lacking all of the above, it appears that this truck was
&gt; not destined originally for the north american market as it would not meet
&gt; some of the US safety requirements.  Does anyone know what market this
&gt; truck was originally intended for, given the above information?  Many
&gt; thanks!  Greg
