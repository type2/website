&gt; try this : since one cylinder head was replaced, and
&gt; one not,
&gt; you can find if  one side of the engine smokes-
&gt; remove the exhaust
&gt; at the cylinder head and run the engine, this will
&gt; separate the
&gt; exhaust to isolate the problem ...

May be simpler to just remove the spark plugs from the
'suspected' side - the engine will still run on 2
cylinder - may not idle though so give it some gas.
That will identify the 'smoking side'


Have you checked the crankcase ventilation system - if
that is blocked then strange things can happen.
