Subject: Stalling out

Hi All,

I'm having trouble with my 72 bus stalling.  It has a
76 FI set up (no carbs here!).  I adjusted the valves
on the passanger side (1 and 2 pistons). Now the bus
stalls out. I've changed the points (checked the gap
at lest 6 times), I've changed the condensor and the
cap and rotor, as well as the spark plugs.  When I
turn the ignition the ingine starts up then stalls
out.  It ran before I adjusted the valves, but was
having a tendancy to stall when cold.  What else
should I look at????

Thanks

Rae
