Subject: trouble after rebuilding tranny
Message-Id: &lt;199905070318.UAA19904_at_www2.xoommail_dot_com&gt;

Dear listers,

After i disarmed my 79' german tranny (manual) and changed 
the syncro rings and the little hooks (?!) of the clutch 
assemble of the tranny i'm having problems to get the gears 
in. Before i assembled the tranny i tried out everything 
and the clutch assemble worked fine, the shifter system 
too. Now i started the engine and tried to drive around my 
house but the gears won't go in softly or even won't go in 
at all and i'm kind of in worry about. Firts gear won't go 
in at all, second and third go in when i force em to and 
reverse also grabs once in a while. What did i wrong? I 
gotta say that i could'nt get original syncro's here (I 
live in Paraguay!) so i had to get Brasialian ones and i 
send them to the rebuild shop to open em up about 0.8mm 
cause the would'nt fit. Also i used Brasialian parts to 
repair the clutch assembly of the tranny. May that be the 
problem?
Thanxs beforehand

Michel
