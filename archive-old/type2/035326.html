People, people,

As most of us were taught in 8th grade English (but some have evidently 
forgotten), the plural of &quot;bus&quot; is &quot;buses.&quot; It's one of those spelling 
exceptions. 

Just for the record, in the 9 years I owned it, my 1986 Subaru GL wagon 
stranded me for a ride to work 4 times. Two were a dying battery, one was 
a broken clutch cable, one was a broken timing belt. And it overheated 
and stalled me out once, and once had an expensive brake system component 
fail slowly (did not strand me but did require repair).

My 1978 Westfalia has stranded me 5 times in the 6 years I have owned 
it. Once with a water in the gas tank problem, twice with dying 
batteries, once with a dying double relay, once with a broken crankshaft 
that also destroyed the torque converter (that was an ugly one).  
So my 20 year old car with 200K+ miles has stranded me more than my 9 year 
old one with 100K+ miles did. On the whole, the old bus has been less 
reliable than the relatively new Subaru. 

I think VW buses need more maintenance than many vehicles. Any dedicated and 
detail oriented person can make one reliable if they work at it. But you 
can't just ignore their care and expect them to get you there reliably. 
Some other makes of cars probably are more reliable than buses for folks 
who can't be responsible enough to stay on top of maintenance. I wonder 
if any make and model of vehicles as old as our dear buses are performs 
very reliably though. 

Your actual mileage may vary,
