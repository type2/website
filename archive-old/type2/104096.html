&gt; Anyone know what range of temperatures the cylinder sleeves themselves
are subjected to (not head temp)?  Or would cylinder temps be basically
the same as head temp?  Looking for the upper end of a range to test a
theory, that is can I repair a cracked cooling fin with hi temp epoxy.

Near the head, they are near head temp.  Near the case, they are near case
temp.  In between, they are in between the two temperatures.
