Neil,

Yes, there is asbestos in the OEM VW heater system.  It is located in at
least two places...  first, there is a pad of it inside the heater boxes,
second, there is a ring of it at the flap/heater box connection.  There
may be more, elsewhere, but I don't think so.

You can obtain a rubber(ry) ring that will replace the ring in the
flap/heater box location, but the only cure for the heater box pad is to
replace the heater boxes. OK, well you could pry the sheet metal off the
outside if the heater box, remove the pad, and recrimp, but most non-CA
heater boxes I have seen would crumble if you tried that stunt.

Or as a different poster replied, you can live with it.  Undisturbed, it
is safe enough and after 20-30 years, what loose fibers there were are
long gone.  I am opting for this solution, myself.
