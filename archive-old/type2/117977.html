Subject: Rear Wheel Bearing Job

Hi Folks,

Just a quick message to mention that I replaced the rear wheel bearings on 
the driver's side of my 1979 Westy this weekend.  This was the last of the 4 
wheels that still had the original bearings with 145,000 miles on it, and it 
had been rattling pretty badly.  It's a good thing I checked it, since ALL 6 
of my CV bolts were loose on the wheel side.  The old bearings came out fine 
(once I remembered the big circlip on the inside), and the new bearings went 
in well.  Once the greasing, tightening, and reassembly were finished, I 
took Sweet Pea out for a drive, and was very happy with the results.

All in all, it took me 2.5 hours, and the only injury I suffered was when I 
dropped the backseat bottom on my thumb while putting away my tools!  Thanks 
again to The List for giving me the confidence to replace major parts on my 
Bus and keep a great example running well.

Take care and good luck,
Jason Z Upper
