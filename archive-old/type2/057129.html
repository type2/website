I was talking to james on irc a while back (irc.type2_dot_com hasn't worked
for weeks... what's going on?) and he said that there was some sort of
special dizzy with a 8 pin connector or something like that? 

My dizzy doesn't have anything like that, I put a 009 on my FI 78 and it
worked great, but I took it off because the 009 does not give enough
total advance for a type 4 engine.

I have a crazy idea though- if you take apart a 009 you can see that
what limits the advange is a little plastic piece at the end of the
weights. By gringing/snapping/whatever the plastic piece off, the
distributor would probably give enough advance for a bus, it could
probably even be timed at 7.5 like it is stock and still advance to 40. 

Anyone have any thoughts on that idea? I'm thinking of trying it but I'm
not sure how much of the plastic I should grind off.... or if it will
even work. 

A type4 FI bus will FLY with a 009, but there is a noticable drop off in
acceleration at high rpms where more advance is needed.

oh yeah, another thing... a 009 goes in 90 degrees clockwise from the
stock distributor... (it did for me anyway) do most 009s have a retard
on #3 or are they the same all the way around? would the retard be moved
to #2?  is there any way I can tell if there is a retard built in the
009 I have?
