Subject: Fixed: Bus pulling to one side

A while back I posted a question concerning my bus pulling to one side. The
majority of people who responded told me to check my front disc brakes. I
did that yesterday and they were right.

Long story short is that the last person who replaced the pads didn't do a
quality job, and when I put in new pads, I realized the mistakes that were
made. The problem with both the old and new pads was that they were too
tight in the calipers and did not move freely in and out. This caused
pulling and uneven wear. Upon close inspection of the pads, I realized the
cause of this tightness was the adhesive used to bind the pads to the
backing plates. During assembly when the pad was &quot;glued&quot; to the backing
plate , extra adhesive oozed out and dried on the sides of the plates. The
plates were then painted black and thus hid the extra width created by the
excess adhesive. 

Some of the old pads were so tight that the installer must have used a
hammer to drive the pads into the caliper. Out of the four pads, only one of
them wasn't binding in the caliper. That pad was almost completely worn to
the backing plate, while the rest had a healthy amount of pad left. 

The solution was to pull out my trusty Dremel and grind the sides of the
backing plates. They now fit like they should with absolutely no binding.

It now stops incredibly well and shows no signs of pulling. 

Thanks to everyone out there.

One additional question though, my replacement pads were Wearever Organic
from Advance Auto. I saw in the RMMW catalog that I can get Mintex
semi-metallic pads. What other manufacturers make T2 pads and which ones are
the best? Will I really see a difference between my Wearevers and other
pads?
