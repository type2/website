Subject: Re: [T2] As long as it's off...

Gentlepersons-
                       As long as the belt line cover is off behind my
sliding door, what has anyone coated/painted that strip of
sheet metal that the nylon block and roller ride on...Other
than paint (which doesn't appear to last) any magic coating
for that piece? I lube it with motorcycle chain lube that seems
to ease the travel, but if there's a super coat for the metal
itself...The paint I used last time quickly wore through and
even with the lube, the metal was exposed. ;-(
Question 2:
Does anyone have a use for a KG coupe? Lots of it are still
there (front chrome bumper, if that's an incentive), but no
rear or engine. It's a '69 and only good for parts (all glass !)
must be chained out of my backyard and trailered (of course)
but the price is very right...In East Orange,  New Jersey - think
Newark as a geographical reference - Donator is motivated...
the city is on my back...Tires might pump up...If anyone is in-
terested, though, four tires and rims would be a very good idea.
The KG was given to me pretty much in this fashion...So if you're
close, and have one that could use a mate...You'd be doing me a
really big favor.
