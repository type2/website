Subject: AVP/Bus Depot Engine Problem

I decided to restore my 79 back to it's original condition and I figured
that the best way to start was with a new 2.0l engine. I purchased the
engine from the bus depot and consequently AVP who supplies them with
the engines. My installation went without a hitch and everything bolted
right up. My problem is that when the distributor is set where it's
supposed to be the engine won't start. only when the distributor is
turned way out ( like 180) will it start. My mechanic seems to think
that the crankshaft wasn't aligned properly and that is the problem. I
have left messages at AVP's # and never got a return call, I actually
spoke to a woman who said that I have to speak with Leonard and that he
wasn't in and would call back...no call. Anyway I was wondering if any
list members might be able to tell me what the problem is and how to
correct this?? Is this a common thing?? Does AVP do quality work and
this is an exception?? Is the mechanic wrong and there could be
something else?? Obviously with the distributor out almost 180 it is
impossible to set the timing so the engine will eventually have
problems?? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance
