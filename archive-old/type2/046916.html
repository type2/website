When we bought our 1970 Campmobile a few years ago the first thing I did was
remove [and carefully label and store] the whole TVP system.  Then I did a
major tuneup.

In over 100,000 miles of driving that bus, the only time we've had a
backfire problem was when the exhaust system was in desperate need of
replacement.  With the engine carefully timed, and a tight exhaust system,
it runs and performs just fine.

I have since replaced the original carb with a Brazilian Solex 30/31 unit
which has no provision for attaching/installing the TVP system, and the bus
is no longer subject to state emission inspections due to its age.

FWIW.....
