Subject: Re: [VB] 1974 camper

All,
	The vintage bus list is not very active just now and any ways I 
have no problems reading posts concerning a '74 camper.  I've been on 
the &quot;Bus list&quot; pretty much from the beginning and I miss the on line 
community when all years of VW buses were included.  Ron &quot;Coyote's&quot; old 
lenti... list, great travel posts, Bob Hoover's sermons and so on.
	I agree that running the right tires will make the 1974 camper 
handle better.  Bob Hoover said some time ago that he thought that 
splitty owners were more knowledgeable VW mechanics than folks owning 
later buses.  If that is still true, sending posts regarding issues for 
later buses to vintagebus might still be a good choice!
  Gary Gibson
