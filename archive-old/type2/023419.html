Hmmm...
           Here's the situation:  74 Westy, nice new   T2  transplant
 engine
 that hums and purrs but it's (originally)from a ???----oil filler and 
 dipstick on top. It came out of another bus ('72 I believe...Dave?) so I 
 assumed there wouldn't be a problem...swap out the flywheel and pressure 
 plate,cooling tin etc and cut a new dipstick, right? Did so, and slid it 
 right on. Nice.
         The problem now is : tranny grind/whirrr when clutch is pushed in
 and doesn't stop when the gear is engaged. This did not come on
 gradually, it happened all of a sudden. The archives are leading me to
believe 
 the throwout bearing is shot. Could I have jostled or jolted the TO when I 
 pulled the engine? or are there deeper issues of engine/tranny
compatability here?
             Guess I'll go pull it again...
                                         Today's &quot;can I run on two 
                                          cylinders?&quot; poster child...
                                                                      Snave
                                                                      1974
Westy
