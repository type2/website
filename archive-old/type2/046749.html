Subject: [T2] KAVW 2nd Annual Fall Show Oct 22nd Louisville Ky

hey Volks Folks,

The Ky Area Volkswagen Club will be hosting it's 2nd annual Fall 
Show-n-Shine Sunday October 22nd at PEPBOYS autoparts in Louisville Ky.

this particular PEPBOYS is located at 1001 Breckinridge Ln (502) 899-5090 
for directions to the store.

we'll start at 12noon and go till 5pm. Bring some music and your favorite 
frosty non alcholic bevs and meet Paul Klebahn and Gabby Jacobs authors of 
&quot;BugTales&quot; (they'll have that book for sale.. signed copies mind you.)

also bring any parts you have for sale/trade.

This is a water and aircooled show where perhaps the twain shall mix a 
little  ;)

we're advertising on a bit of short notice.. but we'll still make it a good 
show.

Hope to see ya there!

-Adam Jewell
-Ky Area VolksWagen Club.

PS- Clark?  anything to add?  (Clark Gordon that is..)
