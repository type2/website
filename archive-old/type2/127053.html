Subject: Re: [T2] Share your original paperwork...

&gt; I posted mine on TheSamba, but was curious: How many
&gt; of you still have
&gt; original paperwork, manuals, etc for your busses?

I just purchased a 1978 Champagne Editionm microbus
(I'll tell more about it in a later message on the
list)

&gt; I have the original delivery invoice showing
&gt; shipping from the factory to
&gt; Frankfurt and original paint codes, options, etc.

That really great! I never saw the receipt for a
Tourist Delivery bus before. Would you like to send me
the codes on the M-plate in your bus? I am curious to
them. Probably most codes are also shown on the
receipt...but still...sometimes the plate shows some
other/extra things.

Do you know if there were any brochures or something
to promote the Tourist Delivery Program?

&gt; I also have the original owner's manual and warranty
&gt; certificate. =D

Those are great things to have with your car. I am
gratefull that the Previous Owners of my bus saved
them (especially the first owner of course).
