Subject: Jalousie window handles

&gt;&gt;I'm missing one of the handles needed to open the louvered windows.  I've
checked all of the local junk yards and web-sites I could find, but no luck.
Anyone know where I may be able to find one?&gt;&gt;

You should be able to find them at an RV parts retailer.  These things are
apparently off-the-shelf items for RVs and are identical to our originals
'cept maybe for color.  I last purchased two sets a year and a half back.
As I recall they were pretty inexpensive.
