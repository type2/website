Subject: sliding door

Not too long ago I was closing the sliding door on my 70 Westy and it 
wouldn't go all the way.  So I tried harder.  This was a mistake because 
even though the door almost closed, the big u-shaped part of the hinge 
didn't straighten out like it's supposed to and it took a chunk out of 
the side of my bus.  :(  so I jiggle it around a little and a strange 
piece fell out.  The piece looks like two opposing hooks with a spring 
attatched that are connected in the middle so they open and close I 
think.  After it fell out, the door closed just fine.  I found a picture of 
the piece in the Haynes manual, but I'm not sure what it is or how to get it 
back in place or how important it is.  The door still opens and closes and 
locks and everything, but it is missing this strange piece.  What is it?  How 
important is it to put it back in?  How do I put it back in?
