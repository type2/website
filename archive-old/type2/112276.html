Subject: Re: [T2] 1969 camper?

&gt; I have a 1969 van that has all the camper accessories but no pop top. Is
&gt; this a factory model?
&gt; If so what is it called?

Does it have the Westfalia stickers on the cabinets?

It may be a Weekender (like mine before I took out the cabinets). Not all of
the Westfalia conversions had the poptop.
