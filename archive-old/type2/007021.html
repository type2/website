&gt;The background:
&gt;
&gt;New generator and regulator in July
&gt;Red light hesitant to go out when starting up, but fine after a few minutes.
&gt;
&gt;The problem:
&gt;
&gt;Driving home late tonight, bus completely dies, lights go out, electrical
&gt;burning smell.

Big momentary short - perhaps enough to knock your battery charge
down somewhat?   Rain ?

&gt;Everything comes back a few seconds later, seems fine except lights are ver
&gt;dim at idle, but brighten up when revving engine.
&gt;Generator light behaves normally, ie idiot light works the way it should.
&gt;All battery connections fine, etc.
&gt;
&gt;The Solution:
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas?  Anything I should check first thing in the AM?

Make sure the 'ol fan belt is tight enough so that you're getting
a good charge.  And check the wiring further for a &quot;burned area&quot;.
Had that happen once in the rain. Under dash.

Goode Luck,

-John
