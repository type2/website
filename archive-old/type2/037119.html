Subject: Re: por 15 primer report 

    Personally i like the POR15 brushed... if you have pockmarked metal the
    brush tends to cause the por15 to pool in the pits evening things out, i
    dont think that would happen as well when spraying...

I've used POR15 not just on cars.  I tend to agree that I can
put it on way too thick and then (with the brush) take it off
again which makes me think I've gotten a better seal especially
where cracks/joints are involved.
