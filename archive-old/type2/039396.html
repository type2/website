Subject: New heads on an old motor?? Y/N???

All,

I didn't get many responses to my last post, so here
it is again...

I might be picking up a weber progressive w/manifold
and air filter cheap ($50.00!:-), but in order to use
it, I'd need to convert to dp manifolds on my 1600.

Now, I don't know the history of this motor (neither
did the PO), but it's been good to me for 17,000 miles
and 2 years. I checked the compression yesterday, and
it comes to 120 (+/- 2lbs) per cylinder, which is
almost exactly what it was when I bought it. Other
than standard maintenance, it's been absolutely
trouble-free.

I realize that many folks think it's a bad idea to
change heads unless it's during a rebuild, or in an
absolute emergency, but.._dot_can I *SAFELY* put a rebuilt
set on so that I can use the weber???

I *really* need to get rid of the Brosol 30/31 POS
that's on there now, and I'd really like to run a
weber. But if it's a bad idea to change the heads,
I'll rebuild the Brosol yet again and save the weber
for a future rebuild...still, that would make 4
rebuilds in 2 years, and the thing *still* sucks. I
really feel as if I'm throwing good money after bad at
this point.

PLEASE tell me I can do this;-)

Sorry for Q's, but I'm totally lost in this area...no
engine rebuild knowledge, whatsoever. Yet;-)


TIA!
