Subject: Re: [T2] Rusty Front Brakes?

&gt; That said, I was jacking up the front to turn the wheels (a once-a-month
&gt; project), and I noticed that my brake rotors now have a fairly thick coat of
&gt; rust from their 6-month hiatus.  My immediate thought was, &quot;what do I do
&gt; about that?&quot;, so I thought I would ask The List.
&gt; 
&gt; I figure I have several options:
&gt; 1. Leave the rotors rusty and let the brake shoes clean 'em for me when I
&gt; hit the pedal.  Repeat as necessary, replace scored rotors in 5,000 miles.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Remove the wheel and scrape what I can off, then return to Step 1.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Remove the wheel; remove the caliper, dust cap, bearings, and rotor; wire
&gt; brush and steel wool until shiny; reassemble and hope for the best.

I would remove the pads, steel wool the caliper and spray with a rust
prevention coating from loctite or spray on some oil. Either way something
that can be removed with brake cleaner.

&gt; Any thoughts about the merits or dangers of any of the above options?  I'm
&gt; planning on replacing the rubber lines soon anyway, so this might be a good
&gt; opportunity to do more brake service.

How long are you planning on having the bus laid up?
