Subject: Re: 009 dist in a 1700

im assuming here (so dont quote me on this) that you leave it open, 
uncapped, so the distributor can go by ambient air pressure (im thinking 
airplane instruments here...think what happens when you slap some duct tape 
over the static port or the pitot tube)...if youre that worried about dust 
entering, use a couple inches of vacuum tube on the port (and leave the 
other end open)...thatll keep a lot of stuff from going in...but so far as i 
know, moisture and dust really arent an issue on these things...but i could 
be wrong...

&gt;** question to anyone reading this**
&gt;Should I cap the now unused port on the retard side the dist's vacuum can 
&gt;to
&gt;prevent moisture and dust from entering, or leave it open to ensure its
&gt;proper function???
&gt;
&gt;If you cannot find a stock dist., the sense I get from people with 
&gt;knowledge
&gt;and experience is to install the .050 centrifugal advance dist. on the type
&gt;IV engines.  This dist. is designed for engines of this connecting rod 
&gt;length
&gt;(including porsche 356/912).
