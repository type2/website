Subject: Re:[T2] flywheel

Rob,

You said ...&quot;I thought maybe I needes some shims. After researching the
archives I see that there should be some shims for crankshaft endplay, and I
am not sure what they look like, but on my AVP engine the main seal was
already
installed and there seem to be some &quot;rings&quot; there with an o-ring over
them.&quot;...

If I remember my type 4 engines right there should NOT be an o-ring on the
crankshaft between the shims and the flywheel.  I think it belongs in a
grove in the inside diameter ot the flywheel's mounting boss.  Better check
with Mr. Bentely to be sure though.
