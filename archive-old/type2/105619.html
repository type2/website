&gt; It's normally a white wire on terminal 1 of the coil going to the ECU
&gt; via the wiring harness. The other terminal connects to the backup

To reduce confusion I left out the green lead for the condenser.

&gt; Ok which terminal is terminal 1 ?

There are 3 terminal. Terminal 1 (negative), Terminal 15 (positive) and
Terminal 4 the high tension lead to the distributor cap.

Terminals 1 and 15 both have leads for multiple connections. A Bosch coil
should embossed on top with a 1 and 15 for identification.

&gt; The original unlabeled wire is just brown not white with brown
&gt; insulation ( I do see that wire as well though)

With points there should only be four leads connected:

Terminal 15
 - black to heater fan
 - black to backup lights fuse

Terminal 1
 - white to ECU
 - green to condenser

Some busses with the VW computer analysis plug also have a gray/green wire
on terminal 1.
