Subject: Re: [T2] Propane tank question, Will this work?????????

Worry not you guys--all this stuff on that OPD is just for portable gas
grill tanks and such--
All this garbage does NOT encompass RV permanently affixed tanks---

Just the RV removable one's--like on the front of Coleman pop top tent /
camper trailer, and your propane fired BBQ in your back yard-

No Problem--your covered--

Later,

Terry

&lt;http://www.nfpa_dot_org/Research/nfpafactsheets/propane/propane.asp&gt; Note
the section at the end exempting horizontal cylinders. Many of the
'service station' type refilling facilities do not know the real
regulations. It might pay to do some more research and have some
documentation on-board. I've had to fight a couple times, but I've
always gotten the Westy and Riviera tanks filled. As a last resort, one
just goes to the local bulk plant. They *know* the regulations.

We have two 20lb Horizontal tanks that we use for our oven/range. Both
ARE subject to 10 year inspection, and MUST have the new valves to be
filled here in BC. Same regs when we were in California last year. Been
there done that, went through all of this, still had to get the new
valves. Check with Transport Canada if you are unclear.
