Subject: Re: [T2] What can cause a spark plug popping

Bus Content: I am wondering if anyone could describe how the air flow for
the heater is directed? That is to say, if the cooling fan directs air 
through
the heat exchangers then what is the heater fan in the engine compartment
for?

James,

I believe that the blower motor is just a booster that kicks on when the 
relay is switched on by your heater lever in the dash.  Otherwise, the 
engine-fan blows hot air into the cabin.
