X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

White smoke may indicate ingestion of brake fluid through a leaky servo
diaphragm.  Worth checking servo assistance if you has one fitted.  You
should retain enough air for three or more power assists when the engine is
off and you push the pedal immediately.  If there are less it could be the
diaphragm.
            Bobby.

&gt;   My 74 dual carb bus has developed a interesting thing.
&gt; Now and then, after a mile or 2, it will produce a copious
&gt; amount of white smoke for about 30 seconds then quit
&gt; (smoking). It doesnt normally smoke (burn oil) and seems to
&gt; be running OK except for this little pop pop thing that
&gt; happens at idle now an then.
&gt;   I did run some fuel system cleaner through it. The next
&gt; day was the first time it did this. It didnt do it for a
&gt; week then once again... etc etc
&gt;   It only does it (so far) pretty soon after start up. I
&gt; have heard no &quot;funny&quot; noises before , during or after this
&gt; smoke screen occurs... scares the hell out of the people
&gt; behind me though!
&gt;
&gt;    Any thoughts?
