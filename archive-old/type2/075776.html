Subject: RE: [T2] New Type 2s with radiators....

&gt; Nemo scratches his head, wondering when
&gt; front-mounted radiators became illegal and
&gt; wondering if Ron's new &quot;US street legal&quot; policy
&gt; applies to H4 headlights.


Actually the legality issue would only apply to later busses, due to the
lack of provision for a CAT, plus of course pretty much any bus registered
in California.  That isn't nearly as much of an issue as the other reason I
mentioned - the cost.  There are a multitude of parts that are different on
the watercooled busses, and some of them aren't cheap.  Converting a German
aircooled bus to watercooled with all new factory parts would be a very
expensive (not to mention labor-intensive) proposition.
