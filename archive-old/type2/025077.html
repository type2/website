Subject: How to get Heat in your Bus/Vanagon (Carver P4 Heaters?)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I am importing Carver P4 propane heaters that will work well in a bus or
Vanagon while camping.  Carver says that the heater can also be used while
driving.

(BTW, I still have a few units on order that are not spoken for - p-mail me
for details)

I have not had mine long enough to be able to try it out in cold weather, but
if any listees use their P4's while driving in cold weather, I'd like to hear
your comments.

Most people have mounted the heater under the rear seat.  The warm air exits
through holes cut in the kick plate under the seat.  This will warm the bus up
nicely while camping, and may keep your rear passengers cozy while your
driving, but I'm wondering if this helps out the driver and passenger as well.

I have a customer that is planning on putting the P4 under the rear seat in
his beetle.  This is a good spot as you already have your heater tubing right
there to connect to.  Only problem on the beetle is where to put the propane
tank.  Under the hood?

I'll let everyone know how the beetle P4 installation works out even though it
is not directly bus related.
