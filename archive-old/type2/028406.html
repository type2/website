Tim, this, true or not, does not relate to the issue. VW's attitude to a
market they dont want or compete in is not economic. These people seem to be
acting like swine for reasons other than this. It would not cost them one
sheckle if all our buses burned as we speak. Something else is happening.

&gt;This truly is a sence of values issue. VWoA must maintain profitability or
&gt;die. It is not a goverment agency that can burdon the future with
&gt;inefficientcies now. They are bound to endeavor to balance their books
&gt;every year while in major competition fighting for the big current market
&gt;shares and the demand for current production and later model parts. It is
&gt;inevitable that they must move on from the large to us but small to them
&gt;needs of an ever diminishing market that in great majority do not
&gt;understand the value of real parts.

&gt; One is reality which insures results, the other is facade which
substitutes
&gt;value in fact with value perceived as low price for it's own sake, damn the
&gt;results.
&gt;My sence is a majority of this list know the difference, a much higher %
&gt;than the VW croud generally.
