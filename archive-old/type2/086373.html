Subject: RE: [T2] oily thermostat

Matty,

You can remove the thermostat and clean it with solvent and even a wire
brush just be careful. I would not worry about the oil that is leaking on
them to much. I would worry about the leaks though. Removing the heads
without pulling the engine is actually more work I think. I would invest in
floor jack and some simple stands. actually you can do it all with one jack
and no stands. But again it is a little trickier. You can get an engine
stand for about $100 again depending on the work you want to do, it could be
well worth it. Complete gasket kits are about $70.00 and have almost
everything you need. Extras are rear front and main seals and trans main
seal. About another $20.00. We just finished another 20.00 gasket overhaul
so let me know if you have any more questions about this.

Subject: [T2] oily thermostat


hello all,

i checked out my thermostat last weekend. turns out
the little pulley was broken disabling the flaps. i
have ordered all the parts, and i plan to to replace
the entire system, with exeption to the flaps.

heres what i'm wondering. the thermostat was all
coated in oil, from my (for the time being) leaky
engine. will this affect the thermostats operation.
(ie. insulate it from heat). if so, what can i do
about this until i can get the leaks plugged with new
seals and such.

as always thanks in advance. and answers, insights, or
opinions are greatly appreciated. thanks again.



BTW- is it possible to change heads on 76 Type IV
without removing the engine? i've heard it said that
you can, just wanted to get the opinion of the group.
