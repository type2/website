Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Restoring Daily Driver

&gt; I have a daily (weekday) driver '71 camper that I'm considering restoring.

mine is a 78 daily driver..  didn't &quot;restore&quot; in the auto show sense of
the word, but am slowly getting it back to near normal &quot;Newish&quot; looking
and operating.

&gt; The problem is obviously that I can't do all of this in the span of a few
&gt; days -- or can I?  Just lookin' for feedback as to whether this will be
&gt; just a can of worms best left unopened, or whether I'll really appreciate
&gt; having done it &quot;right&quot;!
&gt;
&gt; For those of you more familiar with painting a vehicle *without* removing
&gt; glass, etc.

I did mine about 15 years ago and getting ready to do it again.  I did not
remove my glass.

I first divided the bus into 9 sections.

3 panels each side
front and rear.
roof.

I did each section one at a time.

this allowed me to take enough time over a single weekend to do each
section.  yes it took several months (some weekend it rained etc)

also rather than using a paint gun and the ensuing time to clean and prep
I used very high quality rattle can paint.  it has held up for 15 years
now and still looks passable.  I am repainting with the same paint in the
same colors (I like it)

doing it &quot;right&quot; is really the right way but sometimes there is no other
option.  Just take the time to really get all the rust

good luck
Bob
