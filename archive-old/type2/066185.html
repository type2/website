H Stephen -  Brick Westi Layout
Here's the Westi layout in the Vanagon years.  Haven't seen any 
pertubations, except for Weekender versions.

Rear hinged pop-top, folding platform on top, sleeping for 2.
Behind driver seat cabinet contains:  Sink, stove, 3way fridge, 
storage.  Front table mounts on side of walkthru, can be stored 
behind drivers seat.
Next cabinet going aft, is small storage at floor with 2 top opening 
small cabinets, topped off with rear table, stored in place.  Under 
aft portion of cabinet is water storage.
Aft cabinet is full height, front opening (FIF) for front part access, 
with rear section accessible from side.
Upper cabinet between aft cabinet and passengers side. door on front 
and shelf at rear.  Bed/seat folds out flat for 2, lots of storage 
underneath.

Observations and comments.  I have removed top doors on low cabs
under table as one has to move table completely out of the way for
access.  Difficult while driving, same for front side of aft cabinet. 
Have found that we don't use cabinet for clothes anyway, we use
duffles, packs, suitcases, etc. &amp; shove bags in cabinets.

Sink, stove, fridge combo is the NICEST layout I have seen. 
Everything there in one compact unit.
Rear section of rear cab is great for tools, right over engine!
Rear shelf great for long tools.  Upper across roof storage is taken 
up with AC for them's that have it.

I've added straps to be able to tie down/in stuff piled on top of 
rear table.  Usually end up with box of dry food goods on floor, not 
enough storage room, easy to move around.  I have a portapotti in a 
box behind passenger seat.  Makes a great first step to penthouse.

Mods that I would if I could and I might.  Eliminate middle cabinet 
(low one) widen bench for 3 people, move water storage to under 
forward cabinet.  Only lose a little difficult to access storage and 
gain additional seat and wider bed.  (yes, I have a 5 person family)

&gt; If y'all could help, I would love to get a complete list of the
&gt; split/loaf/brick interior options among the group members.
