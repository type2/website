&gt;&gt; I finally got my bus going again, and now the fuel pump dies:(   I just
&gt;&gt; checked the store all around here (SEA.) and the average $ is 250.00 
&gt;&gt; OUCH!  I
&gt;&gt; think that's lutacris.......   Anyway,   how does everyone feel about Used
&gt;&gt; pumps?
&gt; 

FWIW, rumor has it that FI Ford trucks use the same pump.  MUCH cheaper 
at the boneyard, and MUCH easier to find a lo-mileage FI Ford pickemup 
than a low-mileage FI lagwagen.
