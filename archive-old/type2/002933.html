I just installed a Nighthawk battery powered carbon monoxide detector in my
camper - since my primary source of heat is a Stewart-Warner gas heater.  It
runs on three AA batteries and has a LCD panel which displays parts per
million, starting at a level of 11 PPM.  The alarm sounds when the level
reaches a dangerous level.  It will start chirping when the batteries go low
too.  You can also display the peak PPM reading - so far mine is still at
zero after one weekend of camping out with light use of the stove, plus
several hours of driving while using the gas heater.

The instruction booklet cautions not to install the unit in a damp area.  I
mounted mine about halfway up on one of my cabinets, away from the sliding
door.

I bought mine for ~ $50 at the local hardware store.
