&gt;&quot;Is there anybody out there that would know what the original curtains in a
&gt;bus would look like, is there a website out there that might have the
info?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Sorry, I don't.  If you find out, please let me know.  My 1971 Westy has no
&gt;curtains, nor any curtain hardware (expect over the sliding door).


Hi leo and hood

In the very early 60's  and back into the 50's the standard westfalia
curtains was a light butter cup type yellow.

In between these years we're not really sure

&gt;From 1965 to 1972 the standard westfalia curtains were a off white loose
weave plaid curtain, with gold one direction and tan the other creating the
plaid on off white.

In the later years 73 and on they used a heavier fabric kinda like burlapish
in a few different colors depending on the kit and colors of the interior,
gold, orange, and others.

At this time I have not been able to locate any original type fabrics
especially the plaids but the sunbrella canvas I use for my curtians and pop
tops has a great color match for the light yellow of the 50's and early
60's.  As far as the plaid no such luck at this time.
