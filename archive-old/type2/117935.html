Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Camper Manual

&gt; &gt;Does anyone know where I might purchase a manual for a 1978 campmobile? 
&gt; &gt;Thanks.

&gt;Do you mean 78 owner's manual of 78 campmobile suppliment? Unforuntately 
&gt;the 78 manuals are no longer in print but the 79 manuals still are:


Hi Robert, Richard,

Check out the Type2_dot_com site and look under the &quot;Bartno-Tek&quot; link.  Sean 
Bartnik has the 78 Camper Supplement scanned and online.  I printed out all 
the pages, cut them to size, and stapled them together to make my own 
version of the camper supplement.  It's not original, but it's free...

Good luck!
