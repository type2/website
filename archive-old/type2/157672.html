&gt; You're assuming all things are equal. That's not the case.  The 76-79
&gt; came stock with a 2L FI engine and an 091 transmission. Those are
&gt; features that make those buses desirable.

And, the typical bus buyer isn't the typical listee.  They buy the vehicle
and worry about the legalities later on.
