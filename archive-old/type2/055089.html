Subject: Clutch Cable Clivis Pin

Just had my clutch cable go out. Like a good boy scout I ordered one about a
month ago. For once I thought I was prepared. Turns out it was the clevis
pin at the at the pedal end of the cable that went. Now its jerry-rigged
with a nut and bolt 'till I can order a new one. Mental note: always carry
new clutch cable AND clevis pin.
