Subject: Side Vent Wing Seals are back!

Here's something you've all been waiting for for a while.  These are the
seals for the opening vent wings on the side (not front door) of your '68-79
bus. (Same seal fits either middle or rearmost side window).  They have been
completely unavailable for nearly two years.

I have 20 arriving this week.  I'm not sure yet when I'll see more, so I'm
giving the List first shot at the ones I know are coming.  Price is $59.95
each plus shipping.  If you want one (or more), drop me an email and I'll
put your name down.  Once the 20 have been claimed, I'll stop accepting
orders until I find out if/when more will be available. If list members
don't snatch up all 20 over the weekend, I'll offer them to the general
public on Monday.
