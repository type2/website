	Danny,
	Its your ignition lock, switch or the wiring harness where it enters 
the switch. You've defined it yourself: All power to everything else is 
fine, you had to do all kinds of intersting wiggling to get it to
function.
	You don't say whether you had to do the interesting wiggles to get
the key to TURN or whether the wiggles had to be added on top of
turning it. If the problem is getting the key to turn to the START
position then its MOST likely to be a lock problem. If the problem
is that turning to the START location doesn't do anything without
some wiggling, then its MOST likely to be the switch.
	Of course, a balky lock can mask a flakey switch. Test BOTH when
you get them appart.

	Bill
