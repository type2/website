Well for all the 73 and earlier bays the answer is easy enough.  Install a 
factory sunroof, very thick and insulated.  The kind that was used in all bay 
years.  If it gets too cold close the sunroof.  When you want to camp open it 
and it is entirely out of your way.  I have a friend that is about to do that to 
his 68 Westy with a sunroof from my 78. 
Good Luck finding the parts.
