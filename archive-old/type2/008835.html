I just wanted to say that I like the way this list is run! Thanks Steve! 
I like non-technical issues too but I'd have to agree that bus sightings
are a pretty trivial matter and should be saved for Fridays - if posted
at all.  You have to ask if someone in Norway cares about a red bus with
a blue door on I-95 in N.C. at 2:00 on a Friday.  

Just my $0.02 - John Reynolds
&quot;Now I have stood up, I have no where to go but down&quot; 


-----I dont really know all the rules of this e-mail list, ---SNIP----
 when I see the administrator of the list tell someone they can no longer
talk about something like sightings of a volkswagen this no longer
becomes fun. ----SNIP----
