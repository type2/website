Subject: Re: PHOOEY on HOT VWs!!!  :-(

&gt; I bought several issues of HOT VWs and Fake Titted Babes...

Wow, that's dead-ee-kay-shun fer shur!  I buy one every couple of
years to get ads for things I need.  I last bought May 1996, and decided
to look through for all them FTB's (like on the cover) but was disappointed.
Didn't seem to be as many as I'd've thought...

VW &quot;portrait&quot; articles: 8
articles with FTB's: 1

How'd I pick a HotVWs with no babes?  Only one ouside the ads, and two
poses (one is the cover) only -- with two different bikinis.  The ads
were a better babe source.  Can't you just picture them women at GEX
rebuilding all the sexy type IV engines in their bikinis?  Is the presence
of a FTB in the ad indicative of the quality of work by any particular
shop?  Sounds like thesis material to me...

There were no portrait articles about women who had built a VW like Kathy's.
Actually, that's obvious, since nobody has built a VW like Kathy's except,
well, Kathy.  At any rate, that's probably not significant because female
car builders are a bit rare.  Oh, well, one issue ain't a good sample, either.
At least HotVWs could get worse -- it could be a motor-sick-ill rag like
Easy Riders.  And it still has the photo want-ads.

But it really is too bad that Kathy's bus didn't get in -- it really deserves
to be in print!  Not my taste, mind you, but fabulously done.

Interestingly, this issue also states, in &quot;Transporter Talk&quot;:
   &quot;There is no such thing as a production four-door Double-Cab!&quot;
and:
   &quot;...I have never seen or heard of a four-door Double-Cab.&quot;
while this month they have the photo ad of Todd's TriStar to prove that
David Heard ain't heard it all!

He probably ain't heard of a four-wheel-drive four-door double-cab (or
a 4wd Kombi) either.
