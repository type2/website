Subject: Re: recently rebuilt starter/solenoid sticking? [plus carb than

&gt;Any thoughts on why a newly rebuilt starter would be doing this?  

I just got done overhauling my &quot;newly&quot; rebuilt starter this past 
Sunday.  Turns out, not much was done to it other than to make it 
look nice (i.e., cleaned and repainted).  I pulled the starter and 
pulled off the housing that covers the brushes and communicator.  The 
brushes were (are) very worn and the communicator had a section 
(tongue) leafed out.  I found the flaked portion lose in the housing. 
The best I could do was re-surface the communicator by hand with fine 
emery cloth, undercut the insulation between communicator leaves and 
free up and polish the old brushes in the mean time.  I did this and 
it werks well (knocking on wood).  I'll eventually track down a used 
6V starter with a good communicator  and get new brushes to replace 
this one.

&gt;Only other possibly-relevant details that come to mind right now: I
&gt;put in a new battery at the same time as the starter; and the brass
&gt;sleeve from the old unit would NOT come out, and so rather than booger
&gt;something up in there and regret it I chose to reassemble with the old
&gt;sleeve in place and hope I wouldn't regret it.  

I don't understand this part.  Not sure what sleeve you're talkin' 
about.  There is a brass bushing in the bell housing that receives 
the starter post.  This is commonly the culprit for a problematic 
starter...
