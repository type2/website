Hi all,

Have a question for y'all....

Here is the scoop.

I took my block in to be line bored by a local shop, it was a 73 AK case
from a high mileage motor, the thrust didnt need to be cut, and the
bearing saddles were in good enough shape that I almost decided not to
have it line bored... in hindsight I wish I hadnt had it done.

So anyway, I tried to put a *new* Bugpack cast counterweighted 69 MM crank
in it. The counterweights hit the #2 bearing saddle, so I tried to
clearance it enough to fit, but couldnt seem to get it done enough.  When
fitting and refitting the crank, I noticed the #2 bearing was getting some
wierd wear patterns on it. It was getting shiny towarwd the rear of the
case, and staying matte finish toward the front (on the bottom half of the
case.

When I bolted it together and turned it it would stick, thinking the
counterweights were the problem I took it in to get assembled to a
shortblock by the local place that line bored it. They used another new
set of mains. and did have to clearance the saddle some more for the
crank, so I figured that was the deal.

After 2-3 days of runing, the bottom end locked up solid. here are some
guesses as to cause, what do you think?

*bent crank (unlikely as its a new one)

* bad line bore (this one i like because of the noticed bearing wear)

* that the engine hydrolocked from a leaky carb (that would be odd since
it started and immediately died if it were hydrolocked it wouldnt have
turned ofver at all, yes?)

* crap in the oil galleys blocked oil to a bearing

Basically I want to kind of have an idea what happened because if they
claim its not a warranty item, i'd like to have some ammunition to come
back at them. Since I got the crank, line bore, and bottom end assembly
from them,  I can't think of much that would make it my fault, can you?

thanks,

Steve

P.S. It was running strong, good oil pressure and not overheating.
