Subject: Re: Air Cool Pushrod Tube Install

&gt;the pushrod tube, and gently tap the wooden handle with a hammer until the
&gt;pushrod tube seats.


Other easily acessible solutions are simply using the big end of another
(spare) pushrod tube with a hammer (rubber mallet if it isn't a spare) or an
appropriately sized socket on a short extension.  Either give the little
nudge the T4 tube needs, and actually tend to straighten out bent o-ring
grooves made by somebody overexhuberant in removal using a screwdriver or
prybar up in the head.

Removal is another matter entirely BTW.  A lot of us profess to only using
our mighty finger strength, wiggling the tubes round then back and forth
till the come out, but frankly if U didn't degrease sufficiently or if some
wonderful PO installed with a lot of silicone or even worse a hardening
Permatex, such methods won't cut it.  They usually do till about 75k miles
on a normally maintained engine but after that other methods may be needed.
One that usually does work for me with very minimal damage to the tube is as
follows.  Take a pair of the vice grips with the slightly rounded jaws, a
good size vice grip (8-10&quot;) and adjust them so they just barely fit snug on
the smaller diameter most of the tube is.  Then place them on each sucessive
tube out on the outboard (head) end, right where the small diameter begins
to transition up to the larger.  Then holding the vice grips firmly, tap
them up near the tube with a hammer.  Breaks them loose nearly every time,
quickly (usually only a good tap or two) and only minorly scratching up the
tubes if at all.

Anyway still at least they aren't the infernal PITA a T1 or wasserboxer tube
is.
