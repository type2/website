Me!

&gt;I'm getting frustrated with the thing not starting reliably despite a brand
&gt;new 6V starter and new #2 cables from the battery to ground and the starter.
&gt;The battery is old but passes a load test. Engine is fresh, but no harder to
&gt;turn over than other vw engines I have. The symptom is the solenoid engages,
&gt;but the starter turns very slowly (approx 30 rpm to 0 rpm depending on how 
&gt;long I've been cranking it). Amazingly, sometimes this is enough to start
&gt;it. Usually however, it requires the spousal unit to apply force to the rear
&gt;of the vehicle while I pop the clutch.

Try a new starter bushing.  Failing that, try a muir/hoover solendoid
thingy.  Failing that, a new headlight switch.
