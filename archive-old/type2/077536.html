Subject: Horsepower question

Hi Jeremy,

Horsepower starts with compression. If you haven't got compression, you will
not make power. It will rev OK when stationery, but there's no load so that
doesn't prove much.

If the bus has been sitting that long, remove the tin and inspect the
cylinders from mouse or wasp nests. These can block airflow and the
resulting heat buildup could cause a valve seat problem, thus ending
compression &amp; power.

It could also be a vacuum line, but I'd start with the compression test.

&gt; 
&gt; Ok experts, here's your puzzle:
&gt; A 1973 day camper (no poptop) with recently (professionally) tuned dual
&gt; carbs, vac advance dizz, 1800cc motor and timed to 7.5 ATDC (like the shop
&gt; manual says). Runs great, idles fine, revs excellent in the driveway, no
&gt; wierd sounds or anything. Clutch is good, adjusted well. Bus sat from 1992
&gt; to 2000, but brakes are loose now and seems to roll without much resistance.
&gt; It won't go normally. It limps along. Tops out at about 35mph and barely has
&gt; the oomph to start out from a stop. on a SLIGHT hill, it will not go
&gt; forward. Am i looking at a tranny issue? Is there any other possibility?
&gt; Help!!
