Subject: starter terminal confusion

hello volks
 i need to know which of the spade terminals are which in my starter.   i
have looked at the wiring diagram over and over but my question is&quot;  does
the Skinny red and white wire to the double relay belong on number 50 or
30?  now i need to know which spade is which?  any pics of how things should
look?
