&gt; &gt; I had the torsion bar adjusted on my '74 Bay to raise the saggy rear end.  So
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I understand the recent adjustment was made to both the inner and outer
&gt; &gt; splines one position.  Any suggestions on how to re-adjust the torsion bar so
&gt; &gt; that the spring plate does not knock against the stopper?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; take about half the adjustment back out, one spline, either one inner or
&gt; outer but the same both sides

I'll bet whoever just adjusted it moved it one spline.  You have to move
both ends to get it right.
