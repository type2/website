Subject: Hi from a newbie

Hi there! I hope some of you can give me insights on a bus that I may buy.
Otherwise, this may amuse you.

It's a 1969 camper. It's rough-looking, but basically restorable, I think.
The engine looks like it's blowing a bit of oil, and it was rebuilt 4 years
ago. The harness also needs replacing, as do the wooden panels and most of
the window seals. It has some rust at key points (under the
windshield/windows, corners).

The camper top is strapped down to keep it from blowing up when moving. I
believe the pop-up tent will have to be replaced, too. Needs headliner,
upholstery, probably a heater I'm guessing, definitely needs a good
cleaning out, has had an idiot move the mirrors on the doors, God knows
what else.

The plate outside the camper says Westfalia-Werke KG, Weidendrick
(spelling?), Westf. Germany, Plan App #2151, Year of Mfr 1969, Serial 24284. 

We won't even discuss paint and minor body work.

The seller is asking $800 and says not to take it on the highway. She paid
$600 for it, and has put probably close to that much in repairs into it,
according to her paperwork. And no, I have not yet driven it. I do have a
friend who is a VW mechanic, though, and I will ask him to look at it.

Why would I want something like this? Hey, I'm really poor and I can work
out a deal with my neighbor. And I used to drive an MGB.

Any thoughts on whether to buy it or not? Is this some great restoration
project or just a piece of crap?

Thanks,
Robin
