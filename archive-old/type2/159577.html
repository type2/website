Subject: Re: [T2] Nominal battery voltage

Hi All,
Not sure exactly what my brain was thinking.   Could be the oddball 43v 
cell on my desk (old vacuum tube radio B+ battery) kept catching my 
eye.    The information in my post is accurate except the # of cells in 
a car battery.  Car batteries use 6 cells, each at 2.1 volts.   Not 12 
cells at 1.2v.  My bad.

&gt; I've heard that auto batteries don't necessarily read exactly 12V due  
&gt; to the details of construction in the individual cells. What would be  
&gt; considered normal for an FI system? I measured my battery today using  
&gt; a DMM with the probes directly on the battery terminals and only saw  
&gt; 10.6 V. (I've also been troubleshooting other electrical problems in  
&gt; the last two
