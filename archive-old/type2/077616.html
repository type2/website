&gt;I only have one question..she asked me if I was going to keep my mechanicl

&gt;I guess came on the fuel injected models. I told her mechanical. Is that 
&gt;the best thing for this engine? I am going to use dual weber carbs.

I have tried both.  The problem with the mechanical pump was that the 
replacements did not seem to last as long as they should.  In an emergency 
I had to switch to an electric which has worked fine for years...

except that I have been having more frequent problems with flooding the 
engine lately and I suspect it could be possible the electric pump is 
developing too much fuel pressure and overpowering the float valve.
