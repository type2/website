Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot List Member Discount

&gt; When I began the process of raising my bus from the dead 3 1/2 years ago
&gt; the very first part I ordered came from Bus Depot after finding Type2_dot_com.
&gt;
&gt; It was fortunate timing because I didn't know what a Bentley was, where to
&gt; find good quality parts or even what the part numbers were. I spent a good
&gt; deal of time learning the various part numbers just by surfing the BD
&gt; website.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure where my bus would be if I hadn't discovered the list and
&gt; subsequently BD.

I think I can speak for a LOT of bus people who are VERY glad that you
did. Your subsequent contributions to the world of internet VW bus
information have been, and I'm sure will continue to be, very helpful to a
lot of us...
thanks!
(And thanks to Bus Depot as well - I've ordered a lot of stuff from them,
never had a problem, and always right on time)
And heck, while I'm gushing, thanks to the list all around - there are
some smart, helpful, and all around great folks out there that I've met in
my 11 years of internet bussing, dating all the way to the old
Vanagon_at_lenti list back in 1994...
Group hug!!!
