Subject: Re: [T2] Front Shift Bushing (was &quot;Shift Coupler&quot;)

Travis,

I could only manage it on my 78 by pulling the shifter
and loosening the front shifter coupling.

I think that it is one of those jobs that will actually take less time by 
doing both of those things than trying to do it the hard way.

Just my opinion...

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Hello All:
&gt; All this talk about shift couplers and bushings and such has my mind on one
&gt; of my ongoing issues:  ultra-sloppy shifting due to a worn-out and mangled
&gt; front shift bushing (the circular rubber thing).  Anyway, I remember reading
&gt; here once where someone was able to replace this bushing without having to
&gt; mess with also removing the shifter apparatus from the floor above; he said
&gt; he was able to move the front section of the shift rod (separated from the
&gt; rear section) far enough back to slip the bushing into housing at the front
&gt; of the rod.  I got under and cuss and try as I might, I could not make it
&gt; happen.  I cannot move the front section of the rod far enough back, and I
&gt; don't want to force anything.  Is there anyone else out there who has been
&gt; able to do it this way without removing the shifter and if so, what is the
&gt; secret?  I just don't want to remove the whole shifter assembly, go through
&gt; the mysteries of getting it all back together right, then have my shifting
&gt; end up being even worse (which is what I keep reading here).  Thanks for any
&gt; contributons!
