Folks...



Unfortunately, I don't have the space to do this myself, so it's
heading into Buslab for the work.  Since the main cost is in the labor
associated with pulling the engine, I'm getting together a list of
other stuff to do while the engine is out.  So far, my list includes:

If anybody has additional suggestions for my list, I'd love to hear
them, and hopefully avoid the cost of pulling the engine again in the
foreseeable future :-)

Thanks!
