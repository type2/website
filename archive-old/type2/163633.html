&gt; Volkswagen marketed it as a &quot;station wagon&quot; in the U.S. to skirt the 25%
&gt; import tariff on imported trucks (which was levied in 1963 due to a trade
&gt; dispute over chicken exports) . That tariff (still referred to as the
&gt; &quot;chicken tax&quot;) exists to this day, thanks to aggressive U.S. automotive
&gt; industry lobbying. 
&gt;
Speaking of tariffs...Chinese cars face a 2.5% tariff here, but American
(or any other foreign-built) cars face a 25% tariff in China. BTW, Chrys-
ler is looking to import a Chinese-built Chery...
