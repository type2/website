Subject: Ignition switch on 71 Westy

I had a short which caused me to replace the electrical switch
part of the ignition.  Then the key cylinder wouldn't turn so I had to
remove that.  Now I have put a used one in that was turning outside of
the lock cylinder but when installed into the cylinder it is frozen.  Am I
missing something in the reassembly of the ignition switch?

The electrical part only goes in one way and the key part goes in one way,
could it be that the lock cylinder and/or key cylinder are worn out and
not meshing properly?

Any help would be appreciated.
