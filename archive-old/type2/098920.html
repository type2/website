Subject: RE: [T2] Soundproof Challenge

Go to http://www.mcmaster_dot_com/ and search on &quot; Adhesive-Back Damping Sheets
&quot;. Scroll down and you'll see the cheapest prices on these dyna-mat type
sheets anywhere.

I've also heard people talk about using spray on truck liner as a sound
deadener. Most of the stuff I found was $70 - $100 a gallon. I searched some
more and found this product called SANI-TRED LRB that looks just as good if
not better and at a cheaper price. http://www.sanitred_dot_com/ The website is
close to chaos, but the product is intriguing. They have some decent
pictures of the product and all its applications. 

LRB is $54.75 a gallon and a quart of the thickening agent is $13.50. Adding
the thickening agent will allow one to put on a single thick layer and also
use it on the ceiling of the bus. 

Following is a description of the product from the website:

The most important qualities of SANI-TRED LRB (Liquid Rubber Base) are:

    A single component liquid polyurethane with both manual and machine
application capabilities which cures throughout it's entire volume,
regardless of application thickness, without producing heat or gas. This
product has the unique technical designation of being &quot;water inducted&quot;.
Meaning water is the actual catalyst which makes LRB cure. On the other hand
it is important to realize that LRB is not soluble in water, meaning LRB
cannot be thinned or reduced with water. 

LRB has the ability to cure &quot;tack-free&quot; at any thickness of application in 4
hours, or less, at normal room temperatures and the ability to cure
overnight at temperatures exceeding minus 45 below zero Fahrenheit and still
retain it's cured qualities. 
Resistant to break down from U.V.  exposure only surface appearance change
if not surface coated or tinted. 
It's Odor-free and Solvent-free. 

High solids content and extremely low  VOC. 

It's Non-hazardous designation allows LRB to be packaged, handled, &amp; shipped
at the lowest possible cost. 

Adjustable pot life from 10 minutes to over 1 hour. 

A shelf life of nearly 4 times that of other urethanes. 

Extremely durable with unmatched qualities of any other field applied single
component Polyurethane product in the world. 

Bonds permanently to properly prepared concrete, wood, aluminum, steel as
well as most all other standard building materials without blistering,
cracking, peeling or delaminating, even in the constant environment of an
underwater installation that is perpetually subjected to alternating
situations of boiling temperatures or extreme cold of -45 below zero
Fahrenheit. 

Even as a liquid, LRB may also be subjected to extreme cold during shipping,
handling &amp; storage without ill effects. 

Molecularly bonds, (&quot;welds&quot;), to itself, new-to-old, at any stage of curing
or age, no other building material has this quality. 

May be installed on damp concrete for positive above ground containment. The
surface must be dry for all negative and/or underground tank installations.
Impervious to high humidity conditions, during or after installation. High
humidity actually enhances curing of all SANI-TRED products. 

Cures and bonds to itself even under water but is not water soluble. 

The only known liquid coating product that is compatible with, and may be
blended with both solvents and water for versatility of installation and
economy. 

Fool-proof user friendly qualities allows LRB to cure even if the applicator
forgets to catalyze the material before installation or inadvertently adds
too much catalyzing water. All will cure in a reasonable but extended time
without costly removal, disposal, or irreversible damage to the finished
project. 

SANI-TRED LRB &amp; AR-Colorcoat products always fully cure to form harmless
solid polyurethanes. This important quality assures that no liquid residual
remains with-in used or partially used and discarded containers which is a
major cost saving advantage that eliminates hazardous waste disposal
expenses. Often other materials are unable to ever cure as separate
components, this includes, and is especially true, of multi-part or plural
component coating materials that are rated as 100% solids. 
SANI-TRED LRB is completely water-proof, &quot;not water resistant&quot; like some
other products, even in the presence of constant immersion or standing water
on a raw edge. 
LRB's viscosity may be adjusted from a thin watery liquid to a thick putty
with the same dependable curing abilities by blending the LRB resin with
various quantities of patent pending TAV or Thick-A-Vator(tm) to allow
unlimited versatility on vertical or inverted application for coating or
vertical crack and joint filling. 

SANI-TRED LRB maintains a permanent flexibility of  650% elongation with
incredible strength and lasting durability with adjustable durometer
readings from Shore A 35-85.
