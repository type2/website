&gt; Discount Tire was able to pull through for me when I looked for snow/ice
&gt; tires with the proper load range when I owned the Guac.  Like Richard said
&gt; though, they aren't cheap.  I don't have the reciept in front of me at the
&gt; moment but I believe I was right around the $1k range for a set of 5 Hakka
&gt; CS's.  The performance of these tires in the snow and ice though?  Simply
&gt; amazing.


WHOA!!!!   and I thought my Michelin Aglis 81 tires were expensive,  4 for
just a bit over $500
