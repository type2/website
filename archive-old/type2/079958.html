&gt;I can't imagine the mail order folks being able to do such a thing
&gt;though...

Well it wasn't exactly that way but I will say in the day Parts Place
(when they were the ONLY aftermarket VW parts clearing house
type place in the mid 80's and a darn fine company back then) used
to &quot;rent&quot; the front bearing install tool for on the car FWD bearings, about
a $250 tool set for $10 initially, then up to about $20, and did not
originally require a deposit.  You had to buy the bearings from them
as well, but they were about as cheap as you could find then, maybe
Rapid Parts was close.  Regardless it was a heck of a lot easier and
cheaper to send them the $15 or $20 compared to paying someone
or tracking down a press to use, and a bonus of course on Rabbits
you didn't have to even take off the lower ball joint to pull the axles
so on the car was a big time savings.

So it can be done after a fashion, of course I think they quit doing it
or started charging a hefy refundable deposit.  And the entire operation
sort of went to hell after they weren't Recycled Bugs anymore.
