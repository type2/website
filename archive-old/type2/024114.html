Hey Folks,
      Most (if not all) of the stuff I'm using (primers, paints, etc.)in the 
restoration of my '77 Westy have the following warning printed on them 
&quot;WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to 
cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm&quot;. Well, I'm in 
Virginia, so does this mean they are safe to use?     Jeff S.  






Just Kidding! Hope I made you laugh. Goodnight all!
