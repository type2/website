Subject: Re: [T2] Calif. &amp; Ariz. Emissions Laws - Conflicting Answers

&gt; &gt; Not correct. It is 1974 and older starting 1/1/03. 1975 and older starting
&gt;
&gt; Isn't it pre-1974?

&gt; Below it says 30 years or older as of 1/1/03 which to me means a 1973
&gt; vehicle will have turned 30 on Jan 1st but 1974 will have to wait another
&gt; year.  If I'm wrong it's odd to me that it's called a 30 year exception.

This is why I included the link for the pdf direct from the CARB and said to read page 3. I believe
you are confusing year with model year. The 1974 MODEL year came out in Sept? 1973.

Here it is:
&quot;Here is a pdf of the new rules for the Bay area. It also mentions the 30 year rolling cutoff on
page
3.

This is straight from the Calif Air Resources Board.&quot;
