Subject: Brake Servo Vaccum hose
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.10.10011061608480.10283-100000_at_comp.uark_dot_edu&gt;

While working on my bus today (dang exhaust system is hanging up on the
studs... won't... work... off...) I traced my vaccum line from my rusty
looking brake booster servo up to the engine compartment.  I had
previously assumed that the servo was unhooked due to the weber
progressive carb I had on it, and I figured that the vaccum line was
supposed to hook up to the carb or intake manifold.

Instead, I traced the hose to the left side of my fan housing, where it
hooked up to an inch long pipe.  Is this the correct location?  The bus is
a '73 with an AW code 1800 engine.  Do other Transporters with Type IV
engines have the vaccum hookup here?  

I previously felt that it was not the stock motor, but hearing some of the
talk on the list I'm not so sure now.  I had thought that the motor was
out of a 74. It does have a sticker on the fan housing that states
something along the lines of &quot;1974 California emissions legal...&quot;  Looking
in the Bentley, the only pic of a pancake fan housing was dated 1977 and
it did not have the inch long pipe sticking out of the left top of the
housing.  Seems to me that the fan would be blowing air out of this little
pipe, unless it is designed for venturi effect.

Any Ideas?
