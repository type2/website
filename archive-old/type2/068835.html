&gt;Fire? I cannot get straight in my head how a 2-stroke would work. Clearly
&gt;the exhast valve can't be open on the compression stroke.

Having just looked at the variety of 2-cycle engines, I'm no longer sure.
The damn things almost defy classification as a group.


&gt;Maybe I have the sematics wrong. I know the valves are different, they're
&gt;essentially flaps, but beyond that I know naught.

In some cases, there are no valves in the usual sense.  You might have a
valve or two, a flapper, or a port (of which there are several types.  In
some cases, the tuned intake and exhaust lengths are part of the &quot;Valve&quot;
system anbd are required to be tuned for it to run at all. You might think
you can't have the intake and exhaust valves/ports/flappers open at the same
time....WRONG! The darn things drive the parts-count as close to zero as
possible making the piston be the valve too.


&gt;
&gt;And another thing. Howcome they can run upside down where we can't? 

You can.  Aircraft engines are so much like a VW aircooled that it's spooky!
Run upside down? You bet!
There are even VW engines used in aircraft, albeit with considerable
modification.  The difference is that aircraft engines do not use a sump
type oil system.  They use a closed system.  On the other hand, Not sure if
I would care if the engine were running if I were upside-down in my VW!



&gt;...but could a 4-cycle run upside down if we put several jiggers of
&gt;oil in the gas tank? Surely not...

Run longer with than without.  The major difference is that ALL parts of a
2-cycle that need lube are in the fuel path.

The definitive minimal engine is probably the model airplane engine.  Very
few parts, no oiling system, no ignition system, and more power per ounce
than anything but a two year old brat.
