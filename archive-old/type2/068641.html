Subject: dash and gas

Hello to all,
        I have been finding it difficult to figure out the exact layout of the
dash on a 64 std micro. I am starting a restoration and this bus has had
the dash stripped. There appears to be a hole for a gas guage on the
left, and I've found a reference to it on a list of changes by year, but
no catalogues seem to list it for sale. I got a Bemtleys coming but I
have this driving need to know. Anybody got an idea, or better yet
anyone have one for this year.  Many thanks    Kohn
