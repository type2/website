&gt;My 76 Westy is for sale---I need to get $2500 out of it to help pay

&gt;
&gt;If I can sell at least 100 raffle tickets _at_ $25.00 each that would 
&gt;cover it.
&gt;
&gt;OK---Give me some input---Is this ethical/Legal---Sounds like a fun 
&gt;way to sell my bus and give at least 100 of us folks a $25 chance on 
&gt;getting an OK Westy???

I'd buy a ticket !  Call me crazy, but 25 bucks is cheap for another Westy.
