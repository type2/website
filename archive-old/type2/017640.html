At last I'm among sane people - Kombi nuts.
Problem.  Had an engine rebuild 1500km ago on a 2 ltr   '74 Kombi - ran
pretty well when I picked it up but I noticed the vacuum guage I fitted
ages ago showed there wasn't as good a vacuum as the old motor.  I'm
sure that when decelerating, the previous motor used to move the gauge
into the 'Decelerate' range - i.e. over 22 inches of mercury and under
pretty strong deceleration it would get up to 24   &quot; Hg.  Now with the
new motor, the best vacuum I get under deceleration is about 20 (this is
around the middle of the 'Drive' range of the gauge).

After a few other problems I'm now having trouble getting the bus to run
smoothly and had a VW mechanic tune it; after that it seemed to have
less power.  I suspect there may be a problem with loss of vacuum
somewhere.  I have isolated the balance pipe that feeds the brake
booster to rule out anything in front of the engine bay by bridging the
two carbys direct with some hose &amp; idling it, and I have checked and
double checked the balance pipe between the two carbies. I've sprayed
WD-40 around the various gaskets and pipe joints hunting for leaks there
to no avail.

Before I start pulling the carbies apart looking for ill fitted
diaphrgms etc I just want to find out what the standard vacuum should be
when its running on idle at operating temperature.  Maybe the vacuum
I've got is what its supposed to be but it doesn't match the ranges on
the gauge - i.e. the reading my motor gives at idle is on the border
between 'Idle' &amp; 'Drive' ranges an the gauge.

THis is the first time I've posted to a list ( yes I did try and sus it
out in archives but my eyes glazed over after the 50th reference to
vacuum advance distributers etc).  I'm not 100% on all the protocol &amp;
techno stuff but I'm sure that if I need to know something one of you
will tell me.  That's the great thing about VW owners - they're so
helpful !! :)
