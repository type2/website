Subject: CO gauge for FI setup

Hi Volks,

I'm planning to convert my westfakia from Dual Solexes to FI this 
winter. So far I have almost all the parts I will need, but I know that 
the final setup will require a carbon monoxide meter in order to set 
the mixture up properly.

Is this an expensive meter?  If the gauge is too expensive for 
occasional use, is there a benchmark setting on the AFM that will be 
&quot;good enough&quot; to get me to a shop to have it properly tuned? Anyone got 
one for sale, or know where to get one in the Toronto area?

Thanks.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
