&gt; Well I logged in to post about a clunking sound coming from my '78 bus.

Jerry, and all,

I was just going to p-mail you with the standard &quot;check your CV's&quot; advice,
until Harmon's post.  Suddenly I realized that there was another possible
answer, and that it was potentially serious.  

The parking brake lever is hinged onto one of ther rear brake shoes.
Every time the shoes are replaced, the lever must be moved from the old to
the new shoes.  The *right* way to do this is to get a rivet and C clip
from VW or lots of aftermarket vendors (I have a baggie I bought from
Ron), BUT...  I have experienced this fastening done with a straight nut
and bolt.  In my case the nut fell off and caused the worst clunking
sound, which may be exactly what is happening to you.  It was just noise
in my case, but I can imagine the nut or bits of it being caught between
the shoe and drum and being a *major* hazard!

(Of course it could still be CV's, so &quot;check your CV's&quot; :-)
