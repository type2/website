Subject: [T2] 73 Bus for sale in California

While driving home today, I saw a 1973 Type 2 for sale in a parking lot.  The
sign said: 73 VW Bus, $1600 Best/Offer, Runs good, 472-0886.  That would be 707
area code.  I took a look.  No rust underneath, white over light yellow body in
good condition. Interior okay, no middle seat.  Appears to be a folding bed in
rear(?).  Engine has all smog connected.  Looks like it will need ball joints
soon.

That's all I know.  Call the above number for further information.  Bus in
Ukiah, California.  120 miles north of the San Francisco Golden Gate bridge on
Highway 101.
