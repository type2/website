Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Deluxe Westy-$16000- Worth it?


&gt;I do not find the asking price out of line. A restored Westy sold on eBay
&gt;recently for just under $15,000. I saw a 76 a few years ago almost mint
&gt;with an ask of $12,000. Looking back now I almost regret not buying it.
&gt;
&gt;Instead I did what most of us do, bought a pretty good bus for around
&gt;$3000 and put another $3000 or $4000 plus labor into it making it look &gt;good and run well.
---------------------------------

Asking prices for baywindow buses seem to have nearly doubled out here in the Pac. NW over the past 18 months or so.  Don't know if they're actually selling at the elevated prices, just my observation based on reading a lot of newspaper ads.

Does this mean that baywindow buses have finally been &quot;discovered&quot;?
