Subject: RE: [T2] Catalytic Converters

&gt; Though, as I found out when I did this conversion on my '82
&gt; Federal Westy, the flanges on the catalytic converter and
&gt; muffler are oriented in such a manner that the tail pipe must
&gt; either point dramatically off the horizontal, either up or
&gt; down.  I solved this by cutting the flange off an old tail
&gt; pipe and having the two pieces re-welded.


To be honest I suspect that this may have been a case of either the muffler
or cat having had a flange that was welded off-axis at the factory. If my
memory serves me correctly we may have had another similar complaint at some
point, but even if I'm right and it was a couple, that would be a couple out
of many. This leads me to suspect that these were isolated cases (i.e. a bad
batch) rather than the norm.
