&gt; Subject: Unleaded fuel
&gt; my Type 2 '82 2L FI aircooled campervan 
	[]  
&gt; Here is my question:  in Australia we will find it hard or very expensive
&gt; to use unleaded fuel after the year 2000.  The mechanic I use here tells
&gt; me
&gt; the engine is not really designed for unleaded, although he could import
&gt; different valves, an upper cylinder lubricant injector and a catalytic
&gt; convertor...  Heck! ...
&gt; What do you do about this in the northern hemisphere?
&gt; 
	[]  Canada changed to unleaded fuel at least ten years ago.
	99.999999999% of the vehicles on the road have been running
	on this fuel for at least a decade, including my van, and almost all
others
	in Canada. 0.0000000001% of people (hot rodders etc) use some sort
of
	additive  you can buy somewhere? 
	[]  My understanding was that the valves in VWs were hard enough to
live without 
	leaded fuel, but note I'm no expert on this.
	My advice, for what it is worth, is do what all Canadians are doing.
Just drive it
	on unleaded.
