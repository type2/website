Subject: foam under gas tank?

I removed the gas tank, (78 westy) and found the leak = old hoses for the vent
system.  I was reading the manual on gas tank installation and it calls for
installation of foam under the tank?

Anyone shed some light on this?  There wasn't any there when I removed it.  I
have some 1/8&quot; thick rubber material.  should I put that under it where the
tan makes contact?

thanks

dan
