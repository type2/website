Subject: Painting type 4 fan shroud

I can find very little about this in the archives.
I am debating whether to paint my fan shroud or just clean it up and leave
it.  Has anyone successfully painted theirs, and more importantly, what does
it look like 5 years or more down the road?  Is it worth it?
