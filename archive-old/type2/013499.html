Dear friends, The mama is about ready for her maide
voyage. I will be leaving Sunday. Headed west toward
Idaho, Washington, down the west coast into deep
Mexico,????? I want to thank you all for your
generosity and wisdom. I will surely be in contact
along the way but for now I have justa few questiions.
While driving at night the lights are behaving
strangely. They are bright at first then they will get
dim. The rpm will suddenly increase as this happens. I
suppose it has something to do with the voltage
regulator. Any suggestions?
David
