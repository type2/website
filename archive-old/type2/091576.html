Subject: Re: [T2] Pilot bearing

I think it is worth it to replace if you already have
the engine out - they are $4 from bus depot.  I also
replace other bushings that are easy to replace even
if not bad so that another engine dropping problem
doesn't appear 20K down the road.  Just a difference
in opinion
