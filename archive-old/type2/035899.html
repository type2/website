Subject: High compression readings

Hi list,

I did my first compression test on Saturday and the results were not what I
would have expected at all.  135, 155, 160, 160.  Huh?  I checked in all my
books and they all talk about low compression, but this is way too high.
Could it be that my (new) compression tester is way off, or is there some
other, more sinister, reason for getting these numbers?  I should mention
that the engine (2 litre) runs fine except for an exhaust leak and I checked
the valves about 2k miles ago.  I can't believe that the compression is
actually that high or I would be getting terrible pinging with regular low
octane fuel, wouldn't I?

Perplexed,
