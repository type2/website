&gt; &lt;&lt;Heading up 395 for some hiking/camping this weekend. Anybody know any
&gt; good vw yards/things to see/people to meet from Ridgecrest north?
&gt; &lt;&lt;We're coming from the central valley over a mountain pass north of the
&gt; 58. Is it the 178?

&gt; Hey Billy:
&gt;
&gt; I live in West L.A., and drive up the 395 now and again to go do the
&gt; same stuff you're gonna do - I never try big road trips in my bus, I
&gt; just don't feel that confident in its ability to handle long periods at
&gt; 50 plus mph, but I'm glad somebody's doing it!  I'm extremely jealous!

I hear this all the time and it saddens me.  Buses were made for road
trips!  If your bus is in good shape it is far less likely to give you
problems on the road than it is around town!  If you drive sensibly (keep
speeds under 60, take your time on hills) you will not be stressing your
bus as much as you do on the way to the supermarket.

Print out the AIRS folks for your route and hit the road.  Scenery is more
scenic through a bus windshield, and you can see over all those folks in
their sausage cars.

George
