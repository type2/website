Hey all!
When I first bought my 72 I was thinking this same thing.
First problem I found was the oil fill and dipstick location being on
top of the motor, and with a 72 you have no inside engine hatch that
would give you access to the top.

Sheet metal, carbs, and all the peripherals can be swapped
(assuming you have a doner bus motor sitting there)

Other than that, I see no problems
Of course, I haven't done any of this yet so I'm speaking from just an
observers point of view and not from experience.

BTW: while putting my motor back in, I ran into a problem with one of
the heads not being repairable.  I returned to the machine shop with 6
heads, (from my 73 914 1.7) and the machinist picked the best one and
did a valve job on it.  It's nice to have spare parts like that laying
around.

( I have three complete 914 1.7 motors sitting in my garage and one
2.0 sitting on the bench, not to mention tons of D-Jet stuff)



Thanks!
