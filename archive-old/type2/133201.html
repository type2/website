Subject: Re: [T2] FI air fuel mixture adjustment (long)

Tim,

First things first....take the cht sensor off the head but leave it in the 
bus.

You probably have enough wire to pull it out from the bus slightly.
Boil a pan of water and take it out and dunk the sensor in it in order to 
get *some* idea of where it really is.  

Bad temperature information is worse than none at all.

Sounds like you have the enrichment set pretty high, but if necessary, set 
it even higher for the time being.

Based on my experience, a 210-220 oil temp would not indicate heads 
running at the temperatures you specified....once again..bad temperature 
readings are worse than none at all.

Something to try...go for a drive at 60mph....then go back home and retard 
your timing by a few degrees...go for the exact same drive(and speeds) and 
see if it makes a difference.

As you said...something is not right!

also, what do your plugs look like??  Burned? sooted up?  Different from 
each other by a large margin?  Correct plugs in?..plug range too 
hot?..vacuum readings are ??

I know you have probably checked most of these, but let us know!

A picture or two of the plugs and/or your engine would help....maybe 
someone can spot something that is odd....

Cheers, dave

&gt; I too have a '79 westy with the stock California FI setup.  Things were 
&gt; great until a few years ago when the original engine dropped #3 valve 
&gt; seat at 147,000 miles.  I purchased a turnkey rebuild from AVP and ever 
&gt; since I've had problems burning valves.  I just installed my third set 
&gt; of heads in the last 20,000 miles.  Since my bus is completely stock 
snipped&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, this is what I've done.
&gt; 
&gt; I installed a cylinder head temp (CHT) gauge (with the sensor under #3 
&gt; spark plug) when I installed the latest set of heads.  At 60 mph on 
&gt; flat ground at 75 degrees F, my CHT gauge reads close to 500.  From 
&gt; what everyone tells me, this is hot.  Remember, that all of my cooling 
&gt; tin is  in excellent condition and is present.  My oil temp runs around 
&gt; 210 to 220, so I believe that the cooling system is working properly.  
&gt; I suspect that the gauge might not be very accurate.
