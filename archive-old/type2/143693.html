Put a big sign up on your wall:

VACUUM ADVANCE GOES AWAY ON FULL THROTTLE

Now with that in mind, when you test total advance
with no load, vacuum advance works. 7.5 + 20.5-24.5 +
8.5-11 = 36.5 - 43 total advance.

Going down the road is a different story.

VACUUM ADVANCE GOES AWAY ON FULL THROTTLE

Now you have centrifugal advance of 20.5-24.5 + your
7.5 initial which equals 28 to 32 degrees advance.

Right where you want to be.
