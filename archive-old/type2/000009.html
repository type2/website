As many of you know I will be leaving for Germany for three years in 
December.  I would like to have the chance to meet as many of you as possible 
before I go.  I have a few open weekends in November and one in December to 
do this.  The bus loads for Germany Dec 10 or 11 and will be out of my hands 
for a month or so.  If you would like to get together and camp a weekend in 
December let me know.  I will be flying out of Lax and shipping the bus out 
of Carson, near Compton.  PCH was fun but was not my cup of tea, the camping 
was fun though.  Let me know guys as I will most likely never be in Cali 
again, and could very well play host to those visiting the FATHERLAND.
Peace Out
Rick
Some know where in the Mojave desert
