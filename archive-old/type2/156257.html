Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap door seals from CIP

&gt; They sound just like the ones I got from Bus Depot in the &quot;complete
&gt; front door seal kit&quot; parts numbered 82000 and 82001. Although they fit
&gt; great and the quality appears to be good, the lack of a molded corner
&gt; leaves a gap that allows the wind to make a _lot_ of noise at the top
&gt; front corner. I will have to replace these with the better quality seal
&gt; later.

Thats interesting.
My old seals were shot so these will be better no matter what.
There were a few possible ways to deal with the top corners.
-stay on the round part and glue
-cut and bevel the top corners and stay at the edge (best I think)
-stretch and glue around the top corners (what i did)

my point was at 23.00 for the pair its a very good deal.
