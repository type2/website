Subject: Can't get engine back into bus(1600DP in 71)

I just had my 1600 DP rebuilt for my 71 bus.  Rebuilder installed
rebuilt flywheel which should be no problem.  I am using the same clutch
disk and pressure plate.  I installed them on the flywheel using a
centering tool and checked after tightning to make sure every thing was
OK.

Problem is I can't get the engine to mate with the transmission.  Get
everything together to within about one inch and then it's like hitting
a brick wall.  Everything is perfectly aligned.  I've installed engines
before and never had this kind of problem.

Any ideas are appreciated.
