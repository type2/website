Subject: type 4 oil seal tool

I have tried to fit my flywheel oil seal once already and it is leaking again. I was wondering can you buy an insert tool like you can for type 1 engines. If not do you think this would work. Getting a large disk of metal similar is size to the OD of the oil seal, and then drilling holes for the 5 flywheel bolts. You could then push the seal into the case, square to the crank, by tightening the 5 flywheel bolts.

An advice appreciated
