The open-ended nature of your posting suggests to
me that that's the kind of response you're hoping to get, 
supposedly putting pressure on AVP to buy you a new engine.

So has anyone manufactured a westy style wood headliner?
If so I could use some tips on how to cut and bend the
headliner wood to fit the complex curves found in the
front and back of the bus. Also any info on what you used
for insulation (if any) and thickness of material. You can
answer me off list and I will compile responses to save
bandwidth.

  TIA
