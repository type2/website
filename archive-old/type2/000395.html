Thanks to all for the quick replies.... I don't know if the rheostat is
still good and I'm not sure if I wanna find out it's not.  And of course
I'll try to steer clear of a non-VW switch because it is kind of a
central electrical hub.   

To Joe at BustedVW, a couple of places have the switch: Wolfsburg for
$18.95 and Bus Depot for $21.95, just to name 
a couple.  Looks like those are the prices for new ones.  (part #311 941
531A)

(And to Jeff Deltano - I'm singin right along with you.  My '70 had a
full loom of just red and black wires in it when I got it.  And the fuse
box was from a bug (I think), dangling from the dash, wires sticking out
everywhere.  A real nightmare.  And to top it off you can't get full
harnesses for 70s.  Impossible. Though I did get a great (and cheap!)
main loom from wiring works. )
