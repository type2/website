Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Solder Advice

&gt; &gt; Because of the relative rarity of good replacement parts in the Type 3
&gt; &gt; Ghia world we have learned to do things right to rescue our cars from the
&gt; &gt; butchery of previous owners. Go here to see the right way to splice wires:
&gt; &gt; http://www.type34_dot_org/article.php?story=20030125185626789
&gt;
&gt; What?  If I read this correctly, Gonzo recommends that you twist the wires
&gt; together and shrink heat-shrink tubing over the twisted wires _without_
&gt; any other method of securing the wires!

I thought he was kind of braiding them together, soldering and then
shrinking.

The solder joint is stronger than the wire. The twisting is just extra
work for nothing. I would strip like 1/4 in off each, tin them with
solder, solder them side by side and then heat shrink them.

Clean and not lumpy.
