Subject: [T2] Re: WEsty front axle beam...thanks and now another

Thanks to all you fine folks who sent advice...mostly to get another beam 
rather than to repair the old one. Well, this weekend was &quot;get another front 
axle beam weekend&quot;. due to the good graces of a T2 list member, we now have a 
fine beam off a 72 transporter. This dude was undercoated and as best we can 
tell before pressure washing, rust-free.

We were all three surprised at how easy it was to drop the beam. none of us 
had done one before and still it took only about two hours to do the job.

We'll switch the brake stuff over, of course, but I'm wondering if the 
suspension components, particularly the torsion bars, are different on a 
Westy. If so, we'll need to switch these as wel.

Anyone have that answer?

Thanks again, and cheers/Don
75 Westy, China Cat
