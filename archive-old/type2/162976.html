&gt;&gt;Did any bus ever have a solid side middle piece of glass?  I didn't 
&gt;&gt;think so but someone told me yes. Hhhmmmm....

	The Devon camper (at least my '73) has no opening side glass. 
Ventilation is by the front door wind-down windows, and the excellent 
Weathershields Birmingham mini-popup in the main popup roof, and of 
course the very good vents on either side of the dash.
	I'm assuming all this is original eqpt, but of course there 
may have been some past replacements.
