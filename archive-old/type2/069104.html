Subject: Fuel Odor in Bus

        I just bought another bus, it's a '73 model with a camper interior, 
but has no pop-top.  What is this type referred to?   
        My main question is: When I refuel, there is a very strong odor of gas 
inside the bus.  When the fuel level in the tank gets low, the odor goes away. 
 Is there something that I can do the fix this.  I know that there is an 
electric fuel pump in the engine compartment, and it has some other than 
standard dual carbs.  The carburetor name starts with a &quot;D&quot;.  I really need to 
fix the odor thing as my wife will not ride in it now.  She says it is like 
someone sticking her head into a gas can.  I do know that it is not exhaust, 
as the heat exchangers are not connected, and the heat duct is taped up going 
into the bus.  Please help, I would like to take the bus on a short trip this 
Thanksgiving, but can't with the bad smell. 
        Not to make anyone jealous, but I only paid $300.00 (US) for this bus. 
 There is surface rust, but NO holes, and NO rusted out places.  Even the 
battery tray is intact.  Some call a deal like this 'good luck', but I call it 
a blessing from God.
