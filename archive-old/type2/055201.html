Subject: new longblock, f*kinbroken

hello list,

you might recall that i installed an AVP rebuilt longblock in my bus (got it
running last friday). it's a 2L FI w/ hyd. lifters in a '77 bus.

i was driving home from work today and the alt. light on the dash came on.
so i pulled off the road, the engine was still running so i went back and
looked at it, but i didn't see anything moving. the fan/crankshaft pulley
fell off (!). the woodruff key that holds it on is long gone. if you look at
the crankshaft, instead of a spot that should look like this   |_|  there's
a spot that looks like this  \_|

I don't have another woodruff key, so i dunno if it'll stay if i put it all
back (i doubt it).  will AVP's warranty cover this?? or will they give me
some runaround about improper installation. the engine has less than 200
miles on it. can i have a machinist try to fix it?? will i have to tear the
whole engine down??  please tell me i'm not up sh*t's creep without even a
turd for a paddle. It'll be bad enough even if they DO replace my longblock.


sad and pissed,
