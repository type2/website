   I'm a custom woodworker, build just about anything from doo-dads to
furniture (and a large portion of the house I live in) and am fixing to take
a shot at installing a birch roof liner &amp; door panels in my '78 Westy.
   I don't know about the others, re: your wondering what we do for a living
to &quot;afford to drive these things&quot;, but given the price of new vehicles these
days and their attendant $400-500 monthly payments, I'll stick with fixing up
old VW's.
