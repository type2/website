Subject: RE: Heat exchanger paint/Por-20 (Long)

In September issue of VOLKSWORLD they did a 'how to' article on making and 
fitting a large bore exhaust to a Bettle. To prevent it rusting they painted it
with &quot;Eastwood's Satin Black High Temperature Coating&quot; which they claimed 'has
proved to be highly effective'.

I don't know where you would get this...

It would seem to me that painting an exhaust is only something to be done to 
a brand new box, AFTER removing all the primer (other wise the primer will burn 
taking the outer paint with it).

The alternative is a nice Stainless Steel box, I can give any one interested
the name and address that I got mine from. They do them for 1.6 and 1.7 to 2.0 
engines. Cost for my 1.6 was 100 UK pounds ($150 US) plus sales tax and 
carriage.
