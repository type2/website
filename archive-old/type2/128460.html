Subject: Re; Turkey Temp Gauge--

This unit make a bunch more sense than having somebody hang over the
back seat  as you drive, monitoring the oil temps on a Turkey Temp Gauge
at speed--:&gt;)

One problem--I'll bet it ain't three bucks---:&gt;0

Adios,

TK

 
Thermometer at WalMart? 

there is a wireless version available; our shipping manager has the
display unit on the dash of his 79 Westy, with the sender in the
dipstick tube. He filed a couple notches for oil level, and changes the
batteries when it's acting weak.
