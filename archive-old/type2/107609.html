Subject: Re: [T2] MegaSquirt on westy?

&gt; Another question: Did anyone ever install the water-boxer distributor-setup
 (electronic ignition-system) in an aircooled type4?

I do not use the water-boxer set-up.....I did not get it to work on the L-jetronic air cooled fuel system. It
is designed for the Digijet/Digifant system.
I use the 79-83 Calif electronic ignition set-up. It works very well and is designed for the L-jet system. You
probably do not have it at all in Germany? Except for the distributor, the other parts of it are on Rabbits
and Audis here.
