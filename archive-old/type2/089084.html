&gt;
&gt;    By move, I mean in and out- no rotational movement.  If the pin is
&gt; oval, do you mean from rotational forces (should see rotational play) or
&gt; &quot;thrust forces&quot; along the axis of the crank (in out play as you
&gt; wind/unwind the crank by changing direction of movement).  My engine
&gt; knowledge of beetle days is that you don't want rotational movement and
&gt; thus egging out the case hole the bearing sits in.

Mike- your previous post described movement of the main bearing in
the &quot;wind-up &quot; direction, which is rotational. There should be none.
The main bearings are held with .001&quot; squeeze. If not ,then the crank whips,
and causes what you refer to as &quot;egging out the case &quot;.
If the shim pack is too tight on the main,but there is still movement,
then the #1 main is loose in the axial direction, the thrust cut is axial.
What is happening ? The main is loose in both directions, and the
dowel pin is making an oval in the bearing ( and eventually the case )
and needs to have the squeeze fit repaired by align-bore ( cut the case to
a larger dimension and install an oversize bearing to fit. The thrust cut
is axial, and there is another bearing for that. ( If you include bearings
for crank grinding, you will soon see how many permutations and
combinations of bearings there can be for all the possibilities.)

You are losing oil pressure right there, and due to have the crank sieze.
Loss of oil pressure at the mains is starving the rods. My bet is for the rod to
fail.
236,000 miles and a quart every 300 miles ? Let's have a poll on Friday
to guess the miles left in your engine. Time to drain the Duralube and redline
it.

&gt; Since I have an extra running engine (at it's pull), a good spare case
&gt; and 2 core cases, I'm playing an experiment to see what will fail first
&gt; on this engine, or pull it when it's compression goes under 90 or a cyl.
&gt; compr goes, or an &quot;expensive noise&quot; appears or it dumps oil beyond the
&gt; qt per 300 miles now (mostly cold oil pressure or seal blowby).  John
&gt; Kleckner thinks it still sounds good except for slight exhaust leak.
&gt; I've only seen accounts of valves failing, but am curious (and will ask
&gt; the list) what else has ever failed- ie rod bearings is all I've heard
&gt; about.

Oh, it's an EXPERIMENT. ( Nevermind :).
