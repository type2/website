Subject: [T2] mystery wire and condenser

i have rebuilt my 77 2.0 and installed it, but there seems to be two 
problems for which my bently, muir, and chiltons books cannot help.  i have 
a black wire(male hookup) comming out of my voltage regulator with seemingly 
no place to go -- as well as 2 identical wires(female hookups) comming out 
of the fuel injection wiring loom.  These two exit the loom at the point 
where the ignition coil ground appears, a few inches from the control box.  
my wiring diagrams dont show these last two.  i am at a loss to where they 
go.  any help would be appreciated.
ps i also have found an extra condenser while untangling the rats nest of 
wires.  at one time there was a multibattery isolater installed, could this 
be the origin of the extra condenser.
thanks in advance
