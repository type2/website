Subject: gearshift not seating deeply enough

This is a common problem.  There is a short shaft that the front of the
shift rod engages, just forward of the shift lever socket.  This shaft is
kinda weak and is probably bent down slightly.  Just straighten the shaft,
(or it's bracket, probably), and lube everything so it will shift easily.
You can get to the bracket from the bottom.
