Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition opposed to points &amp; condenser

The 009 is not a stock Distributor...the original dis that came in your bus 
was probably (90% sure) a single or dual vacuum advance distributor.  The 009 
was used in the 60's for 1200cc engines...I f you have one ina bus, your 
underpowerd.  009 has 28-30 degrees advance...vacuum advance on mine goes off 
the scale (betwee 40-50 degrees)..youll just be able to access the power 
thats already in your engine.  I  have a new 009 that is a spare only, kinda 
llike a spare tire...itll get you there, but youll want to change it to the 
original as soon as possible,  Im also running a Webber/Holly 2bl that has 
the appropriate access to the right vacuum hookup.
Aloha,
Jeff Raven
