Subject: Re: [T2] Horn wiring

Steve,

Power is supplied to one side of the horn and ground is supplied to the 
other side thru the horn button.

Measure voltage form either side to ground...no voltage means
exactly that....you have no power coming *to* the horn.

Trace wire that should have power on it back to the fuse box.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; I am spending the day trying to get my horn rewired until this winter when I can redo my wiring.  I'm not getting any power from the existing wire (no spark) so I thought I'd just run a separate wire and did so, and still no spark.  Do I have a short or what.  The fuse box is just hanging and is not in a bracket, would this make a difference?  Should I do the Muir short test with the battery ground cable?  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
