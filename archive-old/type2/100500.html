Subject: Gift Giving - Happy Holidays!

Happy Holidays!

I think it's time to start the trinket giving this year, yes?

I have a Westy cabinet handle - dark gray - to the first DIGEST mode listee 
that responds. Send a &quot;copy/paste&quot; of your digest along with the email, oh, 
and your address, and it's yers!
