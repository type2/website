Subject: Re: Dual Port - What does that mean?

The dual port heads were introduced in the 1967 model year in the Type 3s.
That's why your '71 Bus heads have a 311 part number. Some of us Type 3
fans wonder why VW stuck with the single port, single carb configuration
in the Bus for so long.

&gt; In 1971 Volkswagen
&gt; introduced an engine with the same single carburetor and the same inverted
&gt; &quot;T&quot; manifold but in a concession to &quot;new fangled&quot; the ends *divided* and
&gt; each cylinder got its own intake port!  These engines are by custom
&gt; refered to as &quot;dual port&quot; for the two intake ports on each head.
