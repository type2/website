&gt;     I have changed the plugs, points (now Pertronix) wires, cap, rotor,
&gt;AFM, Cold Start Valve, injector seals, coil, all small vacuum lines, Head
&gt;sensor.  The timing is right at 7.5 BTDC.  The FI system has been tested via
&gt;the Bentley method 3 times.  I have checked the grounds, continuity of the
&gt;FI harness.  In spite of all this, it still will not idle &amp; run right

Examine the vacuum sources pertaining to achieving the proper signal for the AFM.
These would be the gaskets at the throttle valve , the intake manifold boots to the runners,
and also at the heads.
