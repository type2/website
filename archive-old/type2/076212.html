Subject: Bodywork Done!

I have to take a minute to thank a few Listmembers who were kind enough to 
share their knowledge with me.  On Super Sunday yet!

I couldn't budge the track covering panel under the left rear window.  And I 
had to get this sucker out before the Bus goes to the paint shop.  

Pete suggested using a 2x4 under the panel and rapping it with a rubber 
hammer.  Craig thought soaking the screws and plate would be a good idea.  
Greg suggested using a 12&quot; legth of wood and moving it around to tap the 
panel free.  Tony suggested using PB Blaster.

So, gentlemen, I used all your suggestions.  I wedged a putty knife between 
the rubber seal and the cover and spayed PB Blaster down into the plate where 
the panel sits.  I let that sit for a few minutes.  I used a 12&quot; length of 
2x4 under the panel and rapped it with a rubber hammer and moved it around a 
bit.  I had that puppy out in a few well placed whacks.

Pete, Craig, Greg, and Tony you are the guys who make this List such a great 
resource.  Thanks for your input.

Mike
