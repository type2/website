Subject: [T2] E park Light /wireing?

My 76 westy hightop conversion e brake light on dash comes on now with the lights on but it goes off if i hit the brake pedal.....
   
  That sounds like a short somewheres but i cant find a wire nowhere touching...?
   
  Did i miss the right place to look?
   
  ideas....? i know i also need to rebleed my brakes possibly also is what a friend told me ... i just havent gotten to that... and when i seen today that the Parking  lights had to be on before the little round dash ebrake light came on.... and then i could push brake pedal and the light would go off...??  i didnt realize this when he and i talked.
   
   
   
  thanks
  chai
