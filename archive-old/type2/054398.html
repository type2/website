 I'm seeking the answers to two puzzling questions and also wish to publish
 my mistakes so that others may benefit.  Last weekend I did a complete
 tune-up on &quot;Emily&quot;...took the stock distributor completely out so that I
 could get at that ridiculous screw that holds the condensor plug on.
Gapped
 the points, lined everything up correctly (I think) and put the distributor
 back in, made sure the dwell was correct, and timed the engine.  The timing
 mark was steady at 7.5 deg. but I noticed that the distributor cap wouldn't
 seat correctly and touching it changed the timing slightly.  Well, to make
a
 short story long, I had put the cap on backwards and when I popped the cap
 off there were little plastic shavings on the rotor that had been gouged
out
 of the cap.  I flipped the cap around and switched the wires around and
when
 I went to re-time the engine the mark jumped around a little and the engine
 runs like crap.  It must also be running hotter than normal since I've
 noticed a little oil usage over short distances.  How would you
troubleshoot
 this situation?  The first step is to get another cap and rotor but I don't
 think that explains the difference in performance.  Also, why must the
 engine always be rotated in the clockwise direction with the generator nut?
 I admit I rotated it a few degrees counterclockwise before I read that
 statement.

 Thanks as always,
