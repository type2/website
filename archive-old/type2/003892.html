    Thought some Ohio listees might be interested in the Spring Swap/Sale at Jim's Custom VW, 219 State Route 7 near Columbiana, Ohio on Sat. April 7th.  There were some good Bus deals there last year.  My one Buddy picked up a '64 Standard and a very solid '66 Sliding Door Standard Splitty, that's right a &quot;Sliding Door Splitty&quot;, both for $600.  The contact info from the Tri-State VW Club, the event sponsor, is below.

See you down the road...
