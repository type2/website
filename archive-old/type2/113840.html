&gt;OK, so let's say that you do want to run an inverter in your camper for Christmas lights, CD player, lava lamp. You know, just the necessities. How much is too much to be draining off the battery overnight?

Just about any A/C load on an inverter will drain your battery overnight.  For a rough estimate, take the watts and divide by 10 to get amps drained from your battery.  For instance, a 100-watt lava lamp would draw approximately 10 amps.  That will drain most batteries in a few hours. 

&gt;I guess what I'm trying to figure is what size inverter would be safe to use, how to connect (silver socket with adapter?) and how to monitor battery usage?

300 watt inverters are plentiful and cheap but they draw a little too much peak current to use in a silver socket.  About the largest inverter that would be safe for a silver socket would be ~150 watts.

Battery monitors - that's a bit tricky.  You should watch voltage and not drain the battery completely.  If it is a 50 amp-hour battery and you have been drawing 10 amps from it for 3 hours, you are nearly done.  If voltage at the battery drops below 12 volts, you are also nearly done.
