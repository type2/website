&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt; My '71 has very loose steering.  I have about 45 degrees of free play.

Many people attack the steering box when there are other problems that are
easier to fix.  Check the drag link joints and the swing lever bushings
before blaming the steering box.  Get someone in the bus to swing the
wheel back and forth while you look for play in the parts.  The last time
I had a play in the system it was the drag link.
