Hi all,
     In case anyone in the general vicinity wants an aircooledT1 or 2, 
we've got a '73 Super Beetle and a '70 Transporter FS. Neither of them 
are worth traveling to TX for IMHO, but for someone local they might make 
decent drivers. Neither is show quality, I don't think either is worth 
restoring to show quality either, but they're both in decent mechanical 
shape. Asking $1500 ea, but that's negotiable, we don't really expect to 
get that much. 

     The bug is Orange, interior is in OK condition. Engine is good, but 
will need to be replaced eventually. I'd expect another year or two of 
use, if kept care of. Upgraded with alternator. Got the usual pesky 25 
year old vehicle problems. Nothing major, just little annoyances. Good 
daily driver. Bought a &quot;real&quot; car with AC and everything now that we have 
a baby, so the bug has to go.

     The bus is my baby, which I kind of hate to let go, but it's time. 
Mechanically, it's in quite good shape, esthetically it's ugly as 
hell-still looks like it did on the Inuvik run, if any of y'all remember 
the pictures. Good daily driver, hauler, etc. Body is pretty heavily 
bondoed, done by the dreaded PO. I've put in a solid DP 1600, Hoover's 
ballyhooed CDI ignition, alternator, CV joints, tranny, even got most of 
the AC unit installed. Kinda lagged on that after it got real hot this 
summer-didn't want to go outside and work on it. ;-) Got all the parts 
though. All that's needed is to install the compressor, and hook up the 
lines to the overhead unit. So, mechanically it's pretty much worth the 
asking price in parts alone. 

     Just so y'all don't worry, we're not bailing out of the aircooled 
world. The reason they both have to go is that we've got a line on a 
sweet '78 Westy, which the proceeds from these 2 will purchase. Need a 
cleaner bus now that we've got the kid. Ahh, the joys of parenthood.  I 
could post some web pix if requested, and there's a couple of old ones in 
my Inuvik reports, &lt;http://www.hintz_dot_org/trip/&gt;. Anyway, if anyone's 
interested, drop me an email.


Peace,
