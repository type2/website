Subject: Front to back heater tube

Well, mabye back-to-front heater tube. 

I am in the middle to 'detailing' the bottom of my '71 bus.
('Detailing refers to the process whereing you use a screwdriver
to chisel off road grime, storing it in your eye for safe keeping.)

One project is the heater tube, back to front. The middle section
is held togehter with roofing tar and clothes hangers. So, I am 
going to replace it with some 3 inch aluminum flex hose. But, there
is one point where the hose goes over the tortion tubes,and
gets real thin and flat. Should I a) squash some aluminum tube
to follow the same path, or b) send the aluminum tube BETWEEN
the tortion tubes, ignoring the original path?

Second question: Those people using bilge blowers to increase 
airflow: Did you have to cut the metal tube forward of the 
shifter to install the blower, or did you replace a piece
further aft?

Third question: Rear heater pipes, under the back seat. Do they
both go APART to turn on, TOGETHER to turn on, both LEFT, or
both RIGHT? I cant feel air unless the engine is revving, and
I am the only person. Cant hit the gas, and feel the vent
at the same time.

All of these are philosophical questions for now, I am in the process
of moving to a house with a real driveway! No more working with
my legs sticking out into the busy street. Should be in my the
new year! Yay! Still no garage, though. Grumble...
