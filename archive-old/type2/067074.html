I've no idea how many of you ever see a DB&amp;HVW magazine or how
many of you, while reading it, have seen the 1/2 page open letter
to VW from Eric Meyer of Simple Shoes (R) It is worth noting, and
worth a thanks to Mr. Meyer and worth repeating here in case VWUS
people didn't see it in DB&amp;HVWs:

Hey Volkswagen look... a consumer!

I know I'm just a stupid shoemaker but I'm also a proud owner and
consumer...you sort of forgot about people like me.  You never
sho up at any of my favorite VW events.  I go to dozen of VW
shows and I belong to lots of big huge national VW clubs but I
never see any of your new products.  You should support those
kinds of things... Automobile marketing is about supporting your
grass roots, through promotions, racing, shows, clubs etc. It is
also through national ad campaigns bud don't let the sheer size
of a market fool you.  You need a rifle...not a shotgun.  Your
marketing and your product have been homogenized... Your are a
unique company...and could still regain that old &quot;part of the
family&quot; feeling you used to have.  Come back to your people and
we will love you again.  Re-educate your dealer network.  Tell
your dealers that they each have to spend some miniscule amount
of their sales income on local promotions and events.  We don't
want a bicycle... we want an enthusiastic dealer that honestly
likes his product...who is helpful, who participates...not one
who could just as easily sell us one of his other brands...we
want enthusiasm and loyalty.  ALong with that renewed enthusiasm
add unique product.  Give your product values that VW stands
for..the basic simplicity, the standard quality with no frills.
You have an opportunity to re-energize VW but it is not just
being another car company... You are the original company with a
soul but, now, even Saturn is beating you at your own game.  With
your launch of the New Beetle you have a wonderful timing
opportunity.  So stop &quot;looking for a few drivers&quot; to find you...
you go out and get them.  Skip the stupid slogans and ad
campaigns...we love you for what you represent...just be that. By
the way...that ad for Jerry Garcia was perfect...personal, cute,
unique, it really touched a target audience...not a
demographically important one but a psychographically important
one.  I'm not a Deadhead but it made me respect you none the
less.  That one ad was better than the _entire_ year long
Farfignugen campaign.

Let's see a return to that same old VW soul that America knows
and loves.  Or at least a public explanation (in an ad in this
enthusiast magazine even?) of your honest thoughts on the future.
We all really want to help you be successful..so what's the deal?
Together we can make VW rock again.
