Subject: Re: [T2] Head Bolt Tightening '78 2.0L

Hi Ralph, I would do a compression test first, if one
of the cylendars is low the best bet is to pull the
engine to find out what is wrong, it's hard to get to
the head with the engine in, and so easy with it out.
(I'll for sure catch a blasting for this but I am set
up to pull engines) Phil
