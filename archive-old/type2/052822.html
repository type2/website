Subject: camper stuff

Greetings, gurus!

I am in the process of buying a 1974 Type 2
camper and hope you all
might give much-needed advice. 

The engine serial number begins with AW meaning,
according to the library, it's an 1800cc
dual-carb job. (I'm puzzled
though because I see only one carb. Were there
single carbs in the AW
series?) I found the note: &quot;109 CID&quot; which I'm
assuming means 109 cubic
inches. It's not fuel-injected so it must be a
Type 2 engine--not Type
4, right? Does it have hydraulic lifters and , if
not, how often would I
need to adjust the valves? How many horsepower
did this engine have and
would it be too much to ask to pull 2 adults and
some household goods
2500 miles? Any superficial things to look for in
evaluating the remaining life in
the engine?

The owner thinks the engine has a problem, maybe
major. He's fairly
unmechanical (like I'm a genius?) and only knows
that after running the
engine for 45 minutes with no problem, he turned
it off, came back a few
minutes later and found a fair bit of &quot;oil and
gas&quot; under the car. But I
checked the oil and it seems more-or-less up to
the dipstick marks. Any
idea what might have happened and if it's serious
(blown seal, gasket? I
was thinking maybe an oil-cooler hose but can't
find the oil cooler to
check the hoses).

My plan is to drive the beast to Mexico and have
work done there. Anyone
know if the Mexican VW engines fit US-sold
campers? How reliable are
they? Would it be possible to put it in a bigger
engine without
extensive modifications? Heard how much they are
if purchased near the
factory outside Mexico City?

Finally, the camper's got a bit of rust, of
course. It's nothing I
couldn't live with until I could have the
Mexicans do some body work for
me down there but I did spot rust on one of the
cross-joints on the
driver's side. Could this be fixed? How dangerous
would this be to
drive? How big a project am I looking at here?
Can I expect to live to
see the fruit of my efforts or should I make
plans now to pass it on to my
great-grandchildren???
