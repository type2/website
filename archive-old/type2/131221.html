Subject: RE: [T2] Type 4 motor, engine stand question...

     I am working on exactly the same thing right now.  I want to get a 
starting stand set-up.  As far as I know aren't the bolt pattern and 
dimensions the same for the type1 (upright) and type2 (pancake) engines?  I 
know the starter gear and maybe the bushing would have to be changed each 
time you wanted to switch engine or flywheel types, which would probably be 
a minor PITA, but that's my plan right now.
     Anyway, my girlfriend works at a machine shop so I kind of have an 
inside scoop :-)  I gave her an aluminum tranny case from a type1 that had a 
wicked crack in the front part but near the nose cone, but the bell housing 
was fine.  She is (today in fact) cutting it flat just in front of the bell 
housing on their big band saw, and welding an aluminum plate where she cut 
it about the size of the bell housing so I have something I can drill and 
bolt one of those cheap American engine stands to (ASCII FUN!):

Bell housing      Plate      Engine stand plate
|\_               |          |___
| _|              |          |___
|/                |          |
Cut &amp; welded to-&gt; bolted to-&gt;

     Hopefully I'll be able to just use the adjustable slide thingies that 
come on it already and bolt those right to the aluminum plate they are 
welding on for me.  Then I'll clearance the plate to make room for a starter 
which might leave me only three of four corners to bolt the tranny bell 
housing to the engine stand with, but that should still be okay.
     Then I plan to weld in a battery box on one side between the wheel and 
the upright piece, and a small box to put a 1 gal. fuel can in on the other 
side.  Add a push button starter, maybe a gauge panel, several alligator 
clips, and I should have a starting stand!  If all goes as I expect it will 
cost me the ~$35 I spent on the cheap stand, a little effort, and some 
miscellany such as the push button, wires, fuel line, gas can, etc. :-))

     I'll take pictures as I go!  It will either all work like a champ or 
end up as an utter failure.  Either way I'll learn a lesson!
