Subject: Re: air conditioning

There happens to be an ongoing installation of AC in one of the popular VW
based magazines. They are actually doing comparisons between old compressors
vs new, figuring out set-ups and such. It would be worthwhile to check it
out. I believe the magazine name has &quot;Trends&quot; in the title, but I'm not
gonna name names or anything.

If I recall somewhat correctly, you are MUCH, as in A LOT better off with a
newer compressor unit. They use a fraction of the horsepower the old ones
use, so you can be cool, and drive up a hill...at the same time!!!
Also, make friends with an HVAC guy, chances are he can save you alot of
money on your hosing, and offer some tech tips.

Also, the &quot;Road Cow&quot; has a ceiling mounted AC unit where a roof rack once
lived. I believe the Road Cow has a few other mods though, and this may
affect the performance of the unit.


Good luck, and remember, you're already cooler than other drivers because
you're in a bus!
