Subject: [T2] Yoko Y356 tyre - UK availability?

After several nights of reading the archives, I decided to go purchase the
above highly recommended tyres.
...after phoning several UK Yokohama retailers, I find it isn't available
here in the UK. :(  Neither is my second choice, the Michelin Agilis C!

I wondered if any UK Type2 subscribers have used Avon AV4's?

TIA,

Phil.
