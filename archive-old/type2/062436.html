&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Today Christy (my girlfriend) and I went to Manassas for the annual
&gt; bug-out.  It turned out to be very cool.  Lots of bugs, lots of ghias, lots of
&gt; type IIIs, one 412 (wow, I had never seen one of those before, looked
&gt; like a big squareback).  Also, many buses, westys, and Vanagons.

Wow, I haven't seen a 412 in years... not since I worked in the local VW 
bodyshop. They had one of them in the shop that had broken loose from 
its tiedowns while aboard ship. It came across the ocean (landed in 
Seattle or Portland OR) rolling back against its stops, then rolling 
forward, to be stopped by a bulkhead. VW of A sold their cars, as I 
understand it, FOB your destination, but wasn't responsible for any 
damage enroute.

If I recall, the car was damaged to its totalled value (about $8000 on a 
12 or $14000 car). It sat in our shop for several months, then was 
repaired... and sold as new. The front fenders were pulled out, bondoed, 
and the front end repainted... just one of the many instances where I 
became greatly discouraged with the dealings of our local dealership.

The paint on these cars was something you'd expect to see in an auto 
show. Long before clear coats became popular, VW was using them on their 
best cars. The finish consisted of a color-match primer, an undercoat 
(silver), the color coat, and a pearlessence top coat (clear). 

While picking up some parts from the dealer (for my parent's van), I 
made the mistake of bumping one of these cars. Our Dodge PU wasn't 
scratched, but a 1/4&quot; wide piece of chrome fell off the side of the VW. 
There was not body damage, except a half inch scratch in the paint, 
caused by the chrome. This cost us about as much as most shops were 
charging to repaint an entire VW beetle. After dealing w/ their body 
shop, I know they just popped on another piece of chrome ($26 retail) 
and put the car back on the lot.

BTW, what color was this 412? I was rather fond of the turquois color 
(although they didn't call it that). That paint finish was something to 
behold!
