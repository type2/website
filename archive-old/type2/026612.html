I've had some problem with removing the bakelite stand the fuel pump pushrod fit in...even with the engine out an split. I hope it comes out easily for Shawn.

I was going to suggest that Shawn could leave the old pump in there and reroute through an electric pump, but then I started thinking about that pushrod, already mushroomed, continuing to interact with the engine. Eventually it's going to offer up some of its metal to the engine. That's enough to score bearings and cause a self-destruct. So I guess the electric fuel pump by-pass would only be a &quot;get me home/keep my volks alive for now&quot; tactic.

Thanks! Joe
