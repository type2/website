Subject: '74 Fuel Pump Rebuild?

    Does anyone have a source for a rebuild kit for an 17/1800 mechanical 
fuel pump rebuild kit? My FLAPS had the part listed, but not available. 
Failed to get the part number; duh. In a search of the archives, I only found 
one mention, and he was in the UK. Also I wonder if it's necessary to depress 
the plunger during reassembly as with the upright style pump?
                            TIA, Rob '73 Westy
