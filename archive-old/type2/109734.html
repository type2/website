Subject: Wires???

I just bought a 78 bus (2.0L FI) and I have found two different set of wires
that are just hanging there.  Can somebody please help me identify what they
are???

One is coming out of the bottom of the throttle body/air distribution box area
on the engine.  I can just feel where it goes into the bottom of the throttle
body and the wire runs to the right side of the engine where there is a hook
up that has three little straight prongs on it.

The next set of 2 wires is directly underneith the bus (drivers side foot
panel area) behind the bumper.  These look like they have been cut at one time
and they are just hanging in thin air.

Thanks,
B-rad
