&gt;The Chilton's manual for the Bus is pretty much toilet paper.  I've never
&gt;found Chiltons manuals to be any good.  The Haynes manual is pretty good but
&gt;the big daddy of the manuals is the Official Factory Repair Manual which is
&gt;put out by Bentley publishers.  Using that in conjunction with the Haynes is
&gt;what you need.

Chilton's for aircooled VW's are a joke BUT if you have a late model car 
and get one of their big thick green books it is WONDEFUL.

Yes, doesn't apply to old VW's.
