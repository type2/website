&gt; that is a great picture!!!!!!!!

&gt; I'd say look at the scale- some parts of that bug are under 0*C- so think
&gt; that it's taken on a cold day (night).  and the scale doesnot go above 40*C.
&gt; maybe it hadn't got completely warmed up yet.  Think its more interesting to
&gt; compare what gets warm and what doesn't.

Or is the scale referenced to the &quot;reference&quot; point on the coil?  Seems
like kind of a odd thing to use for a reference point, though.
