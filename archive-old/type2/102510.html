&gt;Those of you who have these set ups, so you run your brake vacuum off of one manifold or both?  

One.  One cylinder in fact.

&gt;another q.    I hook up a vacuum gauge inline to my brake booster to determine if I have a leak in the hoses or diaphram and the vacuum gauge needle was bouncing very fast between 5 and 20 (hg).  both at idle and as I brought up the rpm's.  The vacuum is currently pulling only from one cylinder (#1).  That is where I have it tapped.  What does the fluttering needle indicate?

I have heard it said that it indicates a leaky valve.  Pure heresay, I don't know for sure.  One thing I do know is that my engine has always done it to some degree (VDO 2-1/8&quot; gauge).  My V-8 Mustang (vac gauge pulls from all cylinders) does not flutter even a tiny little bit (AutoMeter 2-5/8&quot; gauge).  I wonder if it's internally damped?  I should run a long hose between vehicles and find out.

Please post if you find any good info about the fluttering vac readings.

Thanks,

-David
