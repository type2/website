&gt;My best guess was either the spring plate bushings or the diagonal arm

Offhand, I can't think of anything else under there that could account for it
aside from possibly the shocks.

Assuming that you replaced the bushings:  What were the replacements?
Rubber or urethane?  If urethane, did you use the (supplied) grease?  If
rubber, did you liberally apply baby powder?  Clarification, man, clarification.
