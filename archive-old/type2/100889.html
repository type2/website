Subject: Re: [T2] Mechanical Ignition Switch - Rekey

&gt; On a late bay (1978), are there any instructions/sites that give info on how

&gt; that I can get to the wafers to re-key the 'cylinder'??

it is such a PITA that I have always used the ignition key as the standard
and switched around all the other wafers to rekey to match the
ignition.  of course this doesn't work if the ignition key is lost or the
ignition switch is the problem.  I do not know the URL but it is in the
library I think
