Thanks to all the people who responded to my query -- either by BWO the list 
or direct e-mail.  I went to a VW show this weekend (Circle Yer Wagens by the 
Appalachian VW Association).  It was bigger and better than ever.  Kudos to 
the folks that worked so hard to make it go!  The weather couldn't have been 
nicer.

Anyway, I found a new (used) front clip (ONE little rust hole at the bottom 
of the windshield sill) which I got for pennies on the dollar, and a highly 
reputable body shop way back in the holler down the street from the maximum 
security state prison (I'm not kidding, folks).  I'll let you know how it 
turns out.  I hope to make it to the High Country Bus Festival in Boone, NC 
at the end of July.  See you there.
