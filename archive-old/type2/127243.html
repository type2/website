Subject: t1 -v- t4 thermostat on t4 engine

I need to re-establish my cooling system, and keeping costs contained
is just good sense. Using the wrong parts, of course, doesn't contain
costs in the long run, so I look to you all. I'm running down the
flaps, cable, bracket etc, but I have questions about a thermostat.
ACN is offering a type4 thermostat. They also offer 2 different type1
thermostats and describe how to retrofit one of the thermostats to
operate in a type4 engine. The type4 thermostat is $75. The type1
thermostat is $25. The type4 thermostat will open at 85C degrees. The
type1 thermostat that they say can retrofit will open between 80C and
85C.
So, here's my question: if the type1 thermostat will open at nearly the
same temperature, why should I spend $50 more? I fully admit I'm new at
this, but is there something I'm missing (be kind)? Does the type1
thermostat travel as far as the type4 between full closed and full
open? Is anyone running a modified type1 thermostat in their type4
engine? Any issues I need to be aware of (need to monitor the
connections more, flaps don't move as quickly or as far, etc)? Any
insight would be welcome as I want the cooling system to make the bus
run better, not overheat because I made the wrong $50 decision.
Thanks, folks.
