&gt;Folks -
&gt;couple of qeustions. I have a '78 with a torn fuel filler neck. I bought a 
&gt;stock, non restricting replacement, #211201119, but it turns out that's not 

That's the replacement that most busses have except for the CA. Instead they have what's affectionately known as the bird beak:

The regular neck looks like this, and the replacement is the same:

&gt;what I currently have on the bus. I think it has an inner and outer sleeve 
&gt;that fit over the metal fuel filler pipe, and the neck does taper down to a 
&gt;smaller diameter hole with a metal ring in it. What kind of neck does a '78 
&gt;normally have? Any one familar with this, have a part # and instrx on how to 
&gt;replace? I tried just pulling it out, but I didn't try really hard once I 
&gt;realised the replacement part I'd bought didn't match.

How are you removing it? It's a tight fit and often needs to be cut off, a new one put on the pipe and the pipe fed into the filler opening...
