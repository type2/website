Subject: wtb. combi camper (TRUE STORY)(f)

        I just thought I'd relate this story to the list since it brought
a laugh and a little embarasment into my life.
        A couple of months ago I was flipping through the automotive 
classifieds in the local newspaper when I came across the following ad.
        
          wtb. combi camper.  old enough to be cheep, new enough to 
          not have much rust.  contact Mary.

        I decided to call Mary that evening.  Even though I would probably
be of little help I figured what the hey, at least I can introduce her to
the list.  us V.W. types have to stick together.
        I called and asked her what she was looking for in the camper, 
she mentioned that the canvas had to be in good shape and it had to look 
nice.  We talked pop tops and other equipment for a few minutes and I 
suggested that she might want a Westy.  She admitted that she had never 
heard of a Westy but would take my advice into concideration.  I also 
mentioned the list and a local group of enthusiasts she might want to 
contact in her search.  She sounded very surprised that there were 
organizations formed around these campers.   I was beginning to realize 
that somthing was very wrong with this conversation.  Misspelled Kombi, 
never heard of a westy, thought older ones were cheeper, amazed at the 
formation of clubs.  Hmmmm, either her world was completely devoid of any 
v.w. knowlege or we were just completely talking past each other.  I was 
intrigued however that she knew she wanted a combi so I asked if she had 
ever owned a v.w.  At that she sounded extremely confused.  she answered 
no and went on to ask why I wanted to know.  Well, the kombi is a 
volkswagen and.....
  No it isn't.  a combi camper is a brand name of pop up trailer.  I am 
looking for a 4 to 6 person trailer that I can take my grand kids camping 
in. 
  To my complete amazement and embarasment, we had just had an extensive 
conversation on two completely irrelivant topics, each thinking that the 
other was talking about somthing else. 
  I apologized and we talked about combi's and kombi's for a while before 
hanging up with a good laugh.

moral:  not everyones spelling is as bad as mine.
