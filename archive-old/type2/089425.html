Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

This is getting off topic, but the reason that Halon is no longer available
relates to the CFCs and the Ozone layer. Just as airconditioners have had to
change over to different gasses, so have extinguisher systems. IF you can
find a source for Halon gas, you can legally re-charge a Halon system, but
you can't install Halon systems anymore (FM200 is the best replacement), CO2
extinguishers are still fine, but you don't use CO2 for the dump systems
like Halon was used for. (Had to do this in an exam a couple of months back
;^)

&gt; Halon and CO2 bottle systems  are still put into commercial areas  that
&gt; have the proper setups for them.  Basically you leave  the area slam the
&gt; door behind you  and then hit the button that i usually right outside
&gt; the door.   In the air force a lot of our generator rooms and computer
&gt; centers were set up with those systems.  Both are large areas with
&gt; usually only a couple people on duty mostly just to  monitor  systems.
&gt; Witnessed a dump on a generator room.  The sound of those (about 8)   5
&gt; foot tall bottles dumping  was deafening.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I read somewhere (I wish I could remember where now) that halon

&gt; &gt;&gt; have. It seems like all things that work really well end up being
&gt; &gt;&gt; outlawed for some reason or another.

&gt; &gt; It was my understanding that it was a safety hazard that got these
&gt; &gt; pulled from the marketplace.  In fact, many industrial applications of
&gt; &gt; halon are still in use.  They require oxygen to be nearby for anyone
&gt; &gt; exposed to the gas.  It (being heavier than o2) and sinks into the
&gt; &gt; lungs, causing the victim(s) to suffocate.  I think people were using
&gt; &gt; the extinguishers improperly and killing themselves.
