Subject: Re Bus Depot service-my experience (++) 

OK, gotta jump in here in Ron Salmon's defense- I went to return a
muffler to BD 10 mo after I got it for a 78(long story, but the upshot
is Ron sent me a non crossover muffler that was an oval, off to the side
one, and when I mentioned mine was a full tube that fit under the heat
shield nicely, he said that style was a Pacesetter and he was expecting
them to send a better one soon NOT made in Mexico, and so I waited- and
waited).  I credit him with being very helpful, he could have said
that's what they offered then, too bad.  He actually tries to find you
the best available.  While there at BD they had a power outage (BIG
thunderstorm), and in the confusion, I left with what I thought was all
I wanted, and had mentioned some stuff they had not in stock.  They
COULD have sent me off with just the muffler exchange.  Without
computers, they figured the total, took my credit info and said they
were applying the list discount, gave a receipt, and off I went.  Later,
I realized I had forgotten the 10 pak of oil filters, and called them on
this, and to my surprise, they soon sent the filters, the other stuff
they were out of stock on, and a credit to my card because they had
forgotten the list discount. They could have &quot;forgotten&quot; that last fact.
No shipping charge!  Very nice muffler, BTW, made in USA, the EGR pipe
is not crimped off, fits right to the heater box pipe ends.  So folks,
look at the big picture first, and settle differences before you send to
the list.  Yes, I could have complained to the list that this muffler
looked like a Beetle knockoff, but dealt with Ron first.
