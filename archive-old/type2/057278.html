Subject: SWM seeks SWF for VW romance, Was Re: Females and Buses

At last! A break (sort-of) from the razor's-edge topic of recent
threads....
	No, this isn't the place for personal ads, but it is *still*
Friday...almost, and I think this link is WAY too relevant!
http://www4.ncsu_dot_edu/eos/users/r/rapalmer/www/kathystory.html
	Richard Palmer really lays it down... scary and dark-like. A good
story, if you haven't read it yet.
	Anyways.... SWM, 27, 158 lbs, average build, 5' 11&quot;, &quot;trippy&quot; (I've
been told) blue eyes, brown hair with a mind of its own, '65 EZ Camper,
'70 Westy, '66 BasketCase Edition Westy, 6-yr. old 55 lb. pet dog-Max-a
good dog!, 2 yrs wrecker driving experience: (&quot;you're old enough to do
this?&quot;,&quot;Gee, I was expecting a big burly tow truck driver&quot;: actual
quotes from two customers, one in a Chevy and one in a Freightliner!), 3
semesters from getting a BA in Spanish (currently in school), Eagle
Scout, 10-15 Grateful Dead shows, sometimes on the hermit/recluse side
of things, a smoker but gonna quit soon (honest!), capable of MIG and
stick-welding, 2 rainbow gatherings, 3 or 4 Phish shows-looong ago, a
pretty-much-complete set of tools I've bought &amp; made for working on
Buses, an avid backpacker, spontaneous, yes-I am religious and it isn't
only about adjusting valves, vegetarian but'll try to go vegan soon,
capable of many domestic tasks-including sewing, cooking (I make a mean
mac &amp; cheese or the wild Oriental Ramen Noodles &amp; peanut butter-Thai
style!), and cleanup, not good at making beds, can tie several cool
knots, enjoy Scrabble (tm), Chess, not big on lowered Buses or &quot;kewl&quot;
chrome but *would* get over it for the right woman, good at
sandblasting, worthless at body filler, good on the more primitive
(early) bus electrics, horrible with M-codes, low tolerance for
fermented beverages and so I don't consume much, don't like wine unless
it's Boone's Farm, enjoy the English and Spanish languages and twisting
them even more so, can talk on the CB with a semi-believable southern
accent, have a 2&quot; VW symbol tattooed on the skin near my right bicep,
scar on left ankle from '91 when using an axe while wearing birkenstocks
(don't do it), peaceable, babble sometimes, like all-night road trips in
bus, like bus trip reports on the List, like strong coffee, believe
it...I ramble sometimes, large sense of humor, like Althea-TLEO-Sugaree
and all that,  ..............

seeking same (yeah, right... better make that &quot;similar&quot;...) in a SWF for
wonderful VW adventures and travels involving aircooled VW buses. The
usual quiet evenings, dinners and movies are great, too. Wanting to
relocate to Arizona, the Southwest-in-general or Oregon from here,
Tennessee...

I've overshot the deadline :p, but the presses must go on :)
