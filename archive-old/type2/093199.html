Subject: Re: [T2] 12V HEATERS

--=====================_2581146==_.ALT

To answer the 12Volt portion of the question: NO, won't work.

This is a common topic year after year. The OEM design that uses the heater 
boxes is a good one but requires a draft free vehicle, tight piping system 
for the heated air, tight exhaust, all the rubber seals in place, and all 
the tin present.

With a few hours of inspection each fall season you should make good clean 
heat all winter. Again - most of our busses are suffering from a couple of 
decades of neglect so things are rusted, missing or &quot;re-designed&quot; by 
previous owners.

I'd suggest a good battery operated CO meter to make sure you are safe and 
consider an aux blower based on a $17 bilge blower available at any boat 
shop (every town has a shop that caters to the fishing folks).

Use this blower to push air through the heater boxes versus not sucking 
through the boxes which could allow exhaust fumes into the system (sucking 
outside air through leaks which might include exhaust gases versus blowing 
air into the system where leaks will allow a bit of heated air to leak out 
of the system which is safer).

Also these little blowers are all plastic and won't deal with very hot air. 
Their box has an upper temp limit of about 160 degrees printed on them - 
can't remember the temp limit exactly.

Also most of the late bay fuel injected buses have lost their double walled 
elbow pipes (outer layer has rusted away leaving only the inner layer) 
which will cut your heater's capacity seriously. I have driven a bus in 
cold weather with these pipes intact and a year later when these pipes' 
outer layer had rusted away. It was the difference between hot and warm 
heat. Either weld a new outer layer on these pipes or switch to '72-'74 
style heater boxes.

Again make the system work 100% and then add a blower if you like.
