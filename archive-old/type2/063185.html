I read in Tom Wilson's rebuilding book that the Type 1 and type 3 cases
were magnesium while the type 4 &amp; late bus cases are aluminum.  He
was noting that since the type 4s are made of aluminum, they don't crack
like the magnesium ones and last much longer as a result.  He called the
type 4 case &quot;bulletproof&quot;

&gt;What I fail to understand is where the aluminium oxide comes from.  I 
&gt;always heard that the VW cases were magnesium, not aluminum.  Or
are  &gt;they an alloy of both.  I know they burn like mag.

I'd heard recently that the cases were made of an alloy of the two 
(magnesium &amp; aluminum) that VW called &quot;Elektron&quot;. Must be mostly 
magnesium cause I've seen Bradley's special &quot;wood&quot; that he burns in 
campfires whilst on CCC trips. Bright stuff that wood 'o his!
