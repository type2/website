&gt; I agree with Al on this one, it's one of those, would be nice but...  
&gt; I've had a '78 with about 175k never done, many vanagons and buses
&gt; around 150k, never done.  I know Dolan has had a set of rear bearings
&gt; sitting in his basement he meant to put on something like 5 years ago,
&gt; never done.

Well, one of the break-downs on this trip was that the driver's side rear
wheel bearing *did* go out.  As John says, VW wheel bearings seem to last
almost forever, so it was at the bottom of my to-do list, but those
bearings are going in to the spare bearing carriers I picked up in
California.  In all my years, tho, this is the first wheel bearing failure
I have encountered.

Given the amount of work tha the rears represent, and despite VW's
recommendations, I think that &quot;replace on failure&quot; is more appropriate
than regular maintainance.  I don't know how long it was bad, but I went
2000 miles between the first sign of vibration and replacement.  YMMV, but
that's a fair piece of road!

Lastly, the rear outer is a straight roller bearing, not a tapered one, so
you have to remove it to clean and regrease it anyway at which point, you
pretty much have to have a rplacement on hand in case it turns out to be
fried.  Even if it's fine, once you reach the point of having two
acceptable clean bearings in hand, which do you install?  The new one, of
course!
