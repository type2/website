Hiya Ben,

I just went through the exact same symptoms with my 1970 Bus.  For what it's 
worth, the trouble was NOT in the tumblers (the mechanical side of the lock).  
Rather, the electrical portion of the ignition lock decided to give up the 
ghost.

Whatever the actual cause might be in your case, you are getting a message of 
the &quot;loud and clear variety&quot; to pull the ignition switch housing and 
rehabilitate all three sections (mechanical, electrical, and steering lock) of your 
ignition lock.  Once you get it out, it's a pretty straightforward job.

A couple of hints.......clean out the parts in brake cleaner.  You know, that 
nasty spray can stuff.  You'll be amazed at what comes out.  And once you 
have the parts all cleaned out do NOT (as in NEVER) mix lubricants.  They'll just 
clog up the works.  Rather, find yourself some Tri-Flow and stick with that 
(as in religiously).

Mike
