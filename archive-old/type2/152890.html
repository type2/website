&gt; 1.  timesert and redrilling and tapping both will require the engine be
&gt; pulled, or can the bottom come off so all the little metal chunks can be
&gt; removed?
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  it's obvoiusly been leak free with the helicoil fix in place, so why
&gt; not go with another helicoil if it saves me from having to pay to have
&gt; the engine dropped or whatever a timesert fix would require?
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  as far as rubber plugs go are these called expansion plugs?  freeze
&gt; plugs?  i can't seem to find much searching the local auto parts store
&gt; websites.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  ok.  i have to ask.  what the heck is a FLAPS?

Hey Dan   1   no you dont have to pull the motor to install a helicoil or 
timesert   If you do rethread just flush the case with kerosene or such  also 
grease the flutes on the tap to catch any shavings   2  shouldnt be a problem to 
re heilcoil  timesert might be more perment  3 I wouldnt use the rubber plugs 
unless a dire starit situation , hell a wooden plug would work almost as well. 
4   FLAPS  friendly local auto parts store   later  Mark Dearing
