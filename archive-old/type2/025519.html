After some trying and studying the archives I am asking for help. Any tricks
to seperate the filler from the tank?

Also thanks for the help re: the intake manifolds and air distribution box.
A combo of placing the box correctly and a little bending ( a long handled
screw driver with the handle fitting in the tubes just right) it is now on.

Finally, with a 79 can I look at the valves of the #1 cylinder to determine
that I am at TDC when installing the distributer? Both valves would be
closed - I could see gaps at the rockers (like when adjusting valves). Am I
correct or way off here?????
 
If children are not learning then we should change how we are teaching them.
