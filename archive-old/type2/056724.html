Subject: Re: replacing my brake servo...

Hi

Just to clarify, there are two hoses on the brake servo, one on the
canister that goes to the intake manifold to get vacuum for the boost,
and another one on the rod. 

Here's what Pat and Karl said:

&gt; The front hose is just a vent to atmospheric pressure, so that the diaphragm
&gt; can move from the suction applied to the rear side.  I think the hose just goes
&gt; into the frame rail, to protect it from road grime.

&gt; It's for 'clean' air on the back side of the diaphragm. You cannot have
&gt; a sealed unit. You need an open chamber in order for the diaphragm to
&gt; move. In a passenger car the back side of the booster is inside the
&gt; vehicle. On the bus it is hanging out in the elements for all the dirt,
&gt; water, and mud to collect in it. 

Thanks to all who replied
