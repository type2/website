I believe the Bentley shows the W7DTC as correct for the early WasserBoxer 
system. In proper operating conditions they give 20,000 miles before the 
electrode erodes into a triangle. I don't think their cost is justified for 
earlier T-IV motors and they won't run as clean on a lower output ignition 
system so you won't increase useful life over the stock Supers anyway. As 
well, the gap on the DTC is not spec for the T-IV and it is not 
adjustable.  Save money, use stock.
