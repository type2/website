I own a '79 with the under-floor gasoline heater and air conditioning.  Unfortunately, I was never the owner of this vehicle when the engine was assembled!  Does anyone out there know how the air conditioning is supposed to go together?  It was a dealer add-on (I understand that all bus AC was), so the Bentley manual doesn't cover it.  

I am subscribing to the list (again!) so you can post back to there.  Thanks!

Also, I am considering a camper-top transplant.  If I move in that direction, I will be sharing the experience here.
