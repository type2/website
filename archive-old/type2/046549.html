Subject: [T2] 72 Westy color  L90D pastel white or L567 ivory?

we dragged my friends 72 poptop Westy over to the paint shop today

but there is no paint code sticker on it, so what color would it be ?

the Wolfsburg west site gives 2 whites   L90D pastel white or L567 ivory?

anyone have a paint code tag on there Westy or know for sure the color code ?
