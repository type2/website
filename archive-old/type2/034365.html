Subject: Heater box parts

Hello list.
After looking at the price of new parts for the heater boxes on my 73 bus I
am resorting to asking the list if anyone has any spares they aren't using.
What I am mainly looking for is the heater control boxes. The part with the
flap to control air flow. I have a gas heater that heats the cabin pretty
good, but does not do enough to keep the windshield clear.
Any help would be appreciated.
