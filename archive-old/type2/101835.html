Subject: wont go into 3-4 78 bus

Ray, List:

It's funny, this is about the 5th person who's had this problem since I had it last week.

Lost 3,4,R. Mechanic said &quot;hockey stick transmission bushing&quot;. Put it on the lift, 3hrs labor &amp; 5$ part,       no tranny or engine drop, shifting is better than ever.

He also replaced my shift coupling, so everything under there, except the 2 or three shift rod bushings is new.

I bought a 78 ... it had no 3,4, or reverse It does 
fine in 1,2 when you shift into 3rd it goes into 1st and 4th goes to 2nd. Im thinking the linkage may be screwed up or something ... can I buy that plate 
under the shifter. Any ideas?
