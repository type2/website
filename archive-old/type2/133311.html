&gt; Thanks for the links on the euro-controls.  They look pretty crazy, but
&gt; neat.  I've got a set of regular, automatic trans. handcontrols on  my '03
&gt; Ford van and a set of portables for rent-a-wrecks, so it's just the manual
&gt; trans. controls that have peeked my interest.

I have used my portables on manual tranny 4wd trucks in 3rd world
countries, only needed 4-5 arms.....  uh, who is steering????
