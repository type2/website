Subject: Needing a VW mechanic....

Hi guys!  I live in the Winston-Salem, NC area and had been working on my 78 
Westy myself, but now working 2 jobs, don't have time to finish it.  All I 
need done is: 1)  timing, 2) replace tins, 3) replace rear seal which I have 
and have gotten the fan housing off.  Other than that, it's a matter of just 
hooking up the wiring to the coil and stuff like that.  

I'm the one who had the significant other who told me I didn't need the 
cooling tins, but now he's gone (boo hoo), although he wasn't much help 
anyway.

If anyone lives in this area, who knows VW's, I'd be interested in talking to 
them about getting me up and running again.

Thanks.

Barefoot Connie
