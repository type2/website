   Get one of those grabber things with the little fingers inside the end, can't
really describe it better than that, but it works by pushing on a plunger deal
that extends the fingers out the other end of a speedometer cable-like doohickey.

   Alternative is one of those telescoping magnets on a stick, which won't stick
to the head since they are aluminum, though the shroud might cause some
difficulty.
   Both devices are available at any good FLAPS, Sears, Walmart, your neighbor's
toolbox?

Good luck;
