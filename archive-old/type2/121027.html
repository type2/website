Subject: when does the spark plug fire?

On a type4 engine does the spark plug fire on every TDC stroke (every 
360 degrees of crank rotation), or on the TDC of the compression stroke 
(every 720 degrees of crank rotation)?

Or even better, is the distributor timed to the crank or the cam?  My 
guess is cam, because otherwise the valve adjustment procedure using the 
distributor marks would be incorrect.

I know, I know.. I could just put the dizzy in the slot on the engine 
I'm rebuilding and give the crank a few spins, but I thought I'd post 
the question because it's cold out in the garage ;)

thanks!
Mike
