Subject: FS in Fresno, Calif.

In todays Fresno Bee:

64 VW panel, rare, nice, needs work [strange how 'nice' and 'needs work' are
next to each other], $3200 OBO  559-877-7888/559-868-3561

65 VW bus, runs but needs work [I guess it's not 'nice'?], $1000, complete.
559-277-2112

74 VW camper bus, pop top, runs xint, $1200  559-222-8691

Now you know as much as I do...... I can go look at any of them.
