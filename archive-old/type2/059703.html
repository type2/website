Subject: generator alignment with pulley wheel

Greetings once again....

Yep, it's one of those weeks in the VW cycle where trouble is the norm,
and reliability is the exception.  Knowing that will change is reassuring
but it certainly doesn't do much to cure the frustration of the moment:)

Quick question.  Is there a way to adjust the generator so that the
generator pulley wheel is on the same plane as the engine pulley wheel?
On both my 65 sedan and my 71 bus, the generator pulley is either too far
forward (fif, sedan) or too far backward (rir, bus).  This causes the belt
to be under extra tension, and in the case of the sedan, to roll up and
out of the V notch in the pulley wheel.  And this is after tightening to
the correct tension.

I've tried to undo the holdown strap on the sedan, but it wouldn't budge
to the front or the rear of the car.

What needs to happen for these pulleys to be on the same plane?  Or is it
natural for the pulleys to be offset a bit.  Each generator pulley is off
by at least 1/2 inch.

And in the sedan, the belt often rubs against the fuel pump, which I know
isn't good.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

Tom
