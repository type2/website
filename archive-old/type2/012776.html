&gt; &gt; steel (I thought it was the torque converter, but I need to check on that)

Sorry, the final drive section of an Auto is cast iron, not Aluminum. I have
had several of these, currently have an 85 with Auto. I even shipped an Auto
from Tacoma to Colorado, the final drive was Cast Iron, very heavy. Now, the
gear box section is aluminum.
