I don't have experience with setting up an electric fuel pump on a Type 2,
but in marine applications the Coast Guard specifies a cutoff switch that is
triggered by a loss of oil pressure.

It's not as simple as it sounds, because there has to be a special bypass
circuit to energize the fuel pump for engine start.  After the startup
sequence, when the engine stops and oil pressure drops the power to the fuel
pump is cut off.

This is intended to prevent an electric fuel pump from continuing to operate
if the engine stops with the ignition still on, which might happen as the
result of an accidental grounding, collision, etc.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  There has to be a way to wire the pump so that it will shut off when the
engine stops.  &lt;&lt;
