Thanks to the folks who answered my oil query. As I expected there was no
concensus. I couldn't make up my mind today at the FLAPS, so I compromised
with Castrol synthetic blend 20W50. The full syntho only came in 10W30 and
5W50 from Castrol, at least in this store, and neither of those seemed
right.  So for now I am going with the blend and see if it does me any good.
By the way, the Mobil syntho came in a 0W30 grade. 0W???? What kind of
engine would use a 0 weight?

Thanks again for the help. Any more opinions are still gratefully accepted.
