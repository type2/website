&gt;Hey Everyone!
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas on this one? :-).  When I turn the &quot;Fan&quot; knob to the left to test 
&gt;out the vent system, a noise comes from the front that sounds like a 
&gt;airplane taking off.

I have just the fan and no A/C and mine is loud especally on the fast setting.

On another note, I had trouble turning the fan switch at one point because the switch would rotate with the knob.  I took the switch out and noticed that there was a preferred way of orienting it.
