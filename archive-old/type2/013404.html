&gt;Between cold and fully warmed-up, my bus goes through a stage where 
&gt;the engine oscillates (vroom-put put, etc) but I cannot find the 
&gt;source.  It is a type4 FI, 2.0.  Any ideas?

What you describe is called &quot;lean hunting&quot;.  The brain leans the fuel mixture 
out too much, causing the engine to almost die then it overcompensates by 
richening it too much which causes the idle to go higher. 

I would venture to guess that this condition only occurs within the first 3-5 
minutes when your engine is cold?  Typically it is the head temp sensor that 
causes this (OHMs drop too low too fast).  But replacing the sensor may not fix 
the problem.  I finally put a 150 OHM resistor inline between my head temp 
sensor and the FI wiring harness and that took care of it.  But I'm not an L-
jet expert - all my experience is with D-jet.  Maybe the L-jet has some better 
way to be adjusted?
