Subject: New dual carbs. Linkage binding.

Ok, I'm in the process of setting up some dual weber ICT's on my 1700. I got the kit from aircooled_dot_net. The hexbar linkage appears to be just a smidgeon too long. It fits, but ever so barely. There is one bracket on each carb which is the socket for the ball on each end of the linkage. Each socket has a nylon bushing. With the hexbar in its shortest position, there is so much pressure against the nylon bushing that it's causing the throttle to stick really bad. It won't close all the way without me pushing it shut with a bit of pressure. Yes, I am using the thinner space-saving jam-nuts.  
 
Should I: a: grind the bushings down a little on each bracket?
b: Grind the hex bar down, ever-so-slightly?
c: Remove the jam nut from one side of the linkage which would make it 1/8&quot; shorter?
d: Just replace the throttle springs with some that are really, really TIGHT?
e: Grind down each jam nut until they are even thinner than they were originally?
 
You can see the carbs near the bottom of page 10 at www_dot_cardomain_dot_com/id/deathead777
You can also see my nearly finished interior on page 9.
Thanks alot, list.                                             -Paul Deatherage
