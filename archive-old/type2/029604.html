Subject: 30/30 PICT idle problem (and solution)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10010071733260.15664-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

When I installed my new Mexican engine, I also bought a new 30/31 carb and
adapter from Ronnie.  I was very impressed by the carb, as it worked very
well as bolted on with _no_ adjustments!  One push of the gas pedal before
starting (to set the fast idle cam), take foot off of pedal, turn key and
engine fires up and idles nicely!

Lately, however, the idle when the engine is warm has become increasing ly
worse, so today I decided to take the carb apart and see what there is to
see.

Can of carb spray in hand, I stripped the thing down.  I made a drawing as
I went along (a couple of the pilot jets are different sizes and
interchangeable).

The culprit seems to be the &quot;GF65&quot; pilot jet that lies on the right side
of the carburator to the rear of the &quot;GF50&quot; jet.  It had a tiny wad of
fibers (where would fibers come from?) on its inlet side.  

I cleaned all
the jets and blasted the passages with the spray carb cleaner and blew
them out with compressed air.

I reassembled the carb, filling the float bowl halfway with gas before
screwing the cover back on so that the engine would fire immediately.

I replaced the fuel filter, although I doubt that the filter would pass
the fibers that clogged the jet.  There was a bit of fine dust in the
bottom of the float bowl.  I'd really like to find an _effective_ in-line
filter!

Fired it up and it ran fine right off the bat.  Checked timing and found
it to be a bit too far advanced, so I backed it off a couple of degrees.
Dwell was within specs.  Reset the idle with the big idle screw and
adjusted the little idle screw for maximum idle speed.  Reset the idle
back to 850 and everything is running fine again!

This is the first time I've had a -3 carb that actually tuned up easily.
Perhaps that comes from being new and tight.

George
