Subject: Junkyard Report: Leon's in Culpeper,Va

Hello Everyone,
  This is a public service announcement for listee's in the Virginia area. Leons Auto Parts in Culpeper, Va. Called them a few days ago, guy told me he had a dozen or so late 70's buses in his yard. Got there Sat. morning about 8:15. First thingI was given was a very confusing map of the yard, then shown a board with 4 digit numbers of location of the buses in the yard, or forest, I should say. I've never seen a junkyard like this one. Very heavily wooded, with roads cut through the place, very rough roads. Most,90%, of the vehicles were jammed deep in the woods, very hard to see some of them. Nearly every bus I found was picked clean. Some of them were impossible to get to without a machete, which one guy I passed was carrying one, he'd obviously been there before. Most of the buses were a good haul from the front office, so even if I had found what I was looking for, it would have been a major PITA carrying it back. Found only two noteworthy buses, one a mid-fifties panel de!
livery van, had faded letters on the side &quot;Culpeper Cleaners and Laundry&quot; and &quot;Call 9044&quot;,
a four digit telephone number!! It was just a shell, and the cab floor was completely rusted away. The other was a 77 to 79 Bus that had suffered a fire. The entire front end was intact and in perfect condition. It had the windshield,wipers,bumper,headlights w/chrome trim rings,turn signals,etc. If anyone is looking for entire front clip, this is as good as you'll find. It did'nt even show any rust around the windshield. If you still decide to go to this place, I would strongly recommend a machete, plenty of insect repellent, maybe a snake bite kit would'nt be a bad idea, and a friend if your after something big/heavy, this place is probably best visited in colder weather, when the overgrowth and insects would'nt be a problem. None that I was able to get to had engines or trans. By the way, don't get lost in this place ( I began to wonder if I'd find some skeletons the deeper I got) because the info sheet says they'll charge you $50.00 to release your car if you return to the !
office after closing time (12 noon on Saturdays) Happy hunting!  Jeff
