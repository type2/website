That will also be helpful.  Glen is capable, however he doesn't have the

If someone would help that would be great and I can afford to give someone a

Relay, recent mechanical notes from previous owner indicate that the start
has been replaced before and that the previous owner had the same problem.

i thought the question was, &quot;is there someone in LA that can help, because 
i am many miles away otherwise i would do it myself?&quot; is this not correct?

sorry but i had to make that observation....
