Hey there Shawn,

My guess is that the flap in the AFM could be jammed shut. Did the
bus backfire when it stalled on friday ??

When the key is turned (starter cranking) the fuel pump gets power
from the starter (start mode). Let go off key, and the flap in the
AFM is *surposed* to switch power to the pump (run mode). If the flap
is stuck, no power to the pump, no fuel, no go.

If the flap is stuck, then you'd get the symptoms you describe. To
check it, remove the air filter and check that the flap moves freely.
If it doesn't then that's the problem. I got the one on my 78 unstuck
once by using a high tech device (a stick from a nearby tree).

Just something else to check....
