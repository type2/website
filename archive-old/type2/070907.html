Boy does this hit close to home! Our Westy was bought to both rebuild and to 
camp in. My 3 yr old has decided the bus is 'his bus' and keeps pestering me 
to paint it white and blue. 
Even at a young age he asks to help daddy when I work on the bus, loves to go 
to parts stores and is always asking when are we going hiking and camping.
When I was a kid we had no money so camping was in the chevy station wagon. 
When I got older the first car was a dune buggy my dad and I built from a 
decrepit VW pan. Thing was, as a kid I didn't know money was tight, I only 
knew that we were camping and having fun.
&lt;up on soap box&gt;
We have opportunities here. We get to be the ones that teach our kids and not 
their friends, the TV, Nintendo and yes even the web. So yes we get to 
imprint a little of us and maybe impart a few values and a little self 
sufficiency at the same time.
My job is not to be my sons friend, its to prepare him for the world and make 
him a good human being.
&lt;down off box&gt;
Our involvement with this hobby is the perfect vehicle,he learns to fix 
things for himself (God think how old they'll be when he's old enough to 
drive) and he gets to take the fruit of his labors and enjoy the outdoors. 
And maybe I'll have taught him to respect and enjoy both.BTW he's decided the 
poptop cot is his bed.
Mark must really have hit a nerve as I reread this ranting ; )
