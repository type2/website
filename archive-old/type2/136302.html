Subject: Re: [T2] Heater just stopped working?

The in-line fuse of which you speak is like 2 inches
forward (in the direction of the front passengers
seat) of the engine compartment overhead-mounted
electric motor, and is easily seen when looking
downwards from the top engine compartment access hole.
 Look into the in-line holder for a blown fuse.  Then
look for bad contact on the heater controls.  Beyond
that, an electrical test light and the schematics in
the Bentley manual....  On some models, the back-up
lights had an in-line fuse on the left of the engine
in the engine compartment.  Don't confuse that fuse
for the in-line fuse for the blower motor, sir.
     
Oh, and the Bosch-type fuses used in our old vehicles
have a knack for corroding after some years.  A fuse
that is not blown may still not have continuity (may
not be carrying current).  Either rotate the fuse in
the fuse box a revolution or two, or lightly
sand-paper the ends of in-line fuses and in-line fuse
contacts lightly before reinstalling.
     
IF the in-line blower motor is blown, you replace it,
and it blows again, then look to a blower motor
in-need of replacement.
     
I presume you already visibly confirmed the fan blower
is not running (enging running, &amp; heater levers both
fully down).  But in the unlikely event the fan blower
IS running, then perhaps one of the blower down tubes
is loose or disconnected.  
     
Bad season for heater to konk-out.  :-(
