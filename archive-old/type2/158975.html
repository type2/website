Subject: Need source for charcoal filter hoses

Listee's,

It's time to replace the charcoal filter hoses on my 71. The charcoal 
filter has one hose going to the right side of the fan shroud, one to 
the oil bath air filter and one coming thru the firewall from the gas 
tank. (there is also another hose from the oil filler to the air 
filter). It looks like they are all the same size. The tube on the side 
of the fan shroud that the hose slips over measures .508 in. or about 13 
mm. What is a source for a good quality hose for this application? - 
especially the hose from the gas tank which has to tolerate raw gas fumes.

Sincere Thanks,
Bill Moon
