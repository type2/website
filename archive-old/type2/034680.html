&gt; Thanks for all the ideas and tips on my suddenly weenie '78 2 liter.

This is fuel injection, Right???

&gt; to prevent it staying on.  This engine will start perfectly on one turn
&gt; at 10 below zero.  It now starts very hard when hot (reminds me of my
&gt; old 914 in the summer). Its now running a little more roughly at mid
&gt; to &quot;high&quot; rpm.
&gt; 
&gt; Next phase of inquiry:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Cold start valve (it does seem to be running rich)???

wouldn't bother, if it starts that easy when cold, it is working.

&gt; 2.  Failing fuel pump (that new filter did help some)??

Fuel injection has the High Presure fuel pump   35PSI I think

&gt; 3.  Fuel pressure regulator??

this could be a problem but hard to check,  the fact that it works at idle
lends me to think it isn't so


the warm hard start problem is a clue, just can't remember what it is,
will go outside and get my FI trouble shooting manual from my van,
although I think it is also in the Library.  it has a great flow chart for
trouble shooting

&gt; the old girl laying in the snow at these temps!

been there done that, your more than right!
