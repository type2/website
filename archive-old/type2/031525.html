Yeah it still is moving, Westward

&gt; Where is this thing going to end up anyways?!  Maybe the History Channel 
&gt; can do a documentary on it...8)

my understanding was that it was going to try and be ended up at the VW
museum?!?!?!
 via Australia, NZ, Europe and anywhere inbetween that it could be figured
out how to get it to, now getting it to and from the Southern Hemisphere
could be a real trick!
