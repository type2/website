Subject: [T2] I need a switch

Hi Everybody,
   First of all, happy holiday to you, whichever holiday you call your own.  
   I'm looking for the proper switch to use with a gas heater.  I've just 
acquired a BN2 that I'm going to adapt to my 71 westy.  I'd like to have a 
the right switch to use.  From the wiring schematic, it seems to be a 
lighted SPST switch.  The light should come on with the switch pulled out to 
the on position.  I'd love for it to have the proper center label too.  Am I 
asking too much?  I'm sure someone must have an extra that they'd be willing 
to part with for a price.
