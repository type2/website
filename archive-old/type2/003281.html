I reread my post and I did make it sound like a broken/missing throttle
return spring/accelerator cable.   ..BUT, the spring is intact and the cable
was replaced yesterday.

Also for the curious, the bus was not parked more than 3 months when i
purchased it. It was parked because the PO thought the clutch was broke. It
also did run once right after I purchased it, and we drove it up to the gas
station just fine, but the accelerator cable broke there, and my friend
decided we should try pulling out the wiring harness without labling
anything. (BIG MISTAKE), I'm still ticked at him about that.

I think the problem is definitely a vacuum leak, because I still don't have
all the vacuum hoses hooked back up. I have the Haynes manual and the Muir
book, and I can't find a reference (hose diagram that's like looking at the
engine) on where all those hoses go. I'm pretty sure I have the big hoses
hooked up right, but there's a couple skinny ones i'm not sure about. One
comes from the throttle body ( ! ) and splits. The other comes from the back
of the fuel return doohicky on the right side of the engine and splits. The
one from the throttle body is currently connected to nipple on the back of
the air intake and the second split is hanging free. The one connected to
the fuel return is currently connected to the side of the intake manifold
and the diaphragm mounted on the front of the engine compartment. It's
probably all wrong, please help!

Also, where does the distributor vacuum advance hose connect?? right now
it's connected to the tube that runs across the top rear of the engine
compartment. That's probably wrong too.

Thanks in advance for any insight, and thanks to all the volks who replied.

Peace!
