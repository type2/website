Subject: Westy Propane Tank

My new Westy, a '78 deluxe, has a rusted out propane tank (the 4# size)
and I need a new (or used, but not rusty one).  Can anyone help?  I've
looked through several &quot;parts&quot; catalogs and can't find one.  The local
RV dealer can get me an '81 up for about $350, which is too much. 
Thanks in advance for any info!
