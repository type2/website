On the subject.....

I heard these new Mexican 1600cc long blocks are now coming with Cast
Crankshafts?  I remember that cracking/breaking of Cast Cranks were a big
problem in the early proto-type VW engines.  They went to Forged Cranks and
thus eliminated the problem...and have used them up until recently.

I know a lot of reputable shops will not sell these new VW Brasil/Mexico Cast
cranks.  Therefore why can VW be using them?  Has something been done to the
engine cases to eliminate Crankshaft stress?  Thus eliminating the need for a
forged Crankshaft?

If they are indeed using Cast cranks now, what kind of problems could be on
the horizon with these engines?  I wonder what Mr. Hoover, or Boston Bob
thinks on this matter?  Fellas??
