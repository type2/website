Subject: smooth throttle

I replaced my hard throttle body gasket with a new one and while I was there
I cleaned and lubed the return spring and linkages. I also cleaned all of
the gunk out of the throttle body itself including the idle screw threads.
Now the o-ring around the idle screw is nice and tight. I also blew a little
cleaning fluid into the ported vacuum advance nipple.

The throttle response is so nice and the idle is much smoother now. I didn't
have to take any slack out of the throttle cable but you should do that as
well while you are there.
