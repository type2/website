Hello List!!

  Well, I thought I was going up to the BBA next weekend, but now it looks
as if I have to drop the engine again. Three weeks ago, I dropped the motor
because of an oil leak and a failed attempt to transplant a 2L in. While I
had the motor out, put in all new seals and replaced the push rod tubes. 

  After installing the pushrod tubes, I reinstalled the rocker arms and did
the valve adjustment ala Haynes. Put the motor back in and started it right
up with no problems. After driving it to work for two days, I started
hearing a tac-tac sound out of the left head and readjusted the valves
again. The exhaust valve on #4 was real tight but got it adjusted and put
everything together. The next day as I was comming home from work the loud
tapping sound reappeared, then I lost all compression from #4, then the
tapping came back along with compression.

  I've read the archives, and from what I have read, I don't think I'm
going to be a real happy camper!! The question I have is..Wouldn't a valve
that was tight indicate a streach valve? Or could it be a bent/stuck valve??
