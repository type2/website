If anyone heading to +ACI-Everybus 2001+ACI- through Ashville taking I26 to Hwy74?
Well I have a favor to ask, If you could stay on I26 just a little longer
and pull into Landrum, SC First Exit in SC I'd like to have a door prize I
picked up  and deliver it to Chris for me.  It's a 1964 23window Revell
plastic model kit.  And It looks like I won't be able to make it and waited
too long to mail it.

Lunch or what ever is on me if you could help me out on this,  min. amount
of time this should add to a trip is perhaps 20min. total.

TIA
