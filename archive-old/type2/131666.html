Subject: Re: [T2] Weber Progressive setup Question

&gt;From: &quot;Lawrence J. Bell&quot; I also have a Weber progressive (32/36 DFEV).  
&gt;Mine is on a 1976 2.0
&gt;Liter which should act similarly except that you actually have better
&gt;heads for an engine with carburetors.  Mine works really well coming
&gt;off idle and at low RPM.  I even get fair gas milage (17 or 18).  The
&gt;big difference is that I use a cheap Bosch 009.  I know everyone on the
&gt;list thinks it's junk but it works well for this application.
&gt;
&gt;The reason for it's popularity, aside from being cheap, is that it's
&gt;advance mechanism is completely centrifugal. It only has about 20
&gt;degrees of advance so  it's maximum advance will only be about 27 or 28
&gt;degrees (7.5 + 20) but that is sufficient with a stock cam.  Another
&gt;advantage is that the distributor is fully advanced at fairly low RPM
&gt;giving it good performance in city traffic.

&gt;As I said, many on the list are very vocal about the virtues of vacuum
&gt;advance mechanisms but I have a feeling you will find the venerable 009
&gt;a good solution.  They only cost about fifty dollars so it's probably
&gt;worth a try.

This is how mine was setup, too. Not for long going back to the FI w/Vac. 
Adv. 205P. Only Vacuum was between the Brake Booster anf Intake Manifold. 
But it worked fine.

TravelOn,
