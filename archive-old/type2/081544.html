Subject: Shift Trouble

I have a shifting problem ion my bus and I'm hoping that some of you tranny
masters can help. My daily driver is a 74/1800/weber progressive/manual
transmission. When I first bought it about a year ago it *occasionally* had
trouble going into 2nd gear. I made some adjustments to the shift plate and
it has been good for over 10,000 miles.

About two months ago I replaced the shift link on the nose of the
transmission, the shift rod bushings, and geased everything up real well. I
also installed one of those 'shift travel reduction' kits and a new shift
plate. Well, I never could get the thing adjusted right, like it would go
into reverse without pushing down no matter how I adjusted it. It also felt
very *sloppy* in general, so I took out the reduction kit and put the old
shift plate back in. It has been great for about a month.

As of today it it randomly nearly impossible to shift into 2nd. Three or
four times through the gears it will be fine, then next time I can hit every
gear except for 2nd. Adjusting the shift plate seemed to help but then when
pulling into the driveway it wouldn't go into 2nd again. When I do get it
into 2nd it holds and pulls just fine, no grinding while shifting or
running. It just suddenly feels like the slot for 2nd is missing. I made
another adjustment to the shift plate in the driveway and it seems OK, but
it feels sloppy again.

Anybody have any suggestions for fixing this, or at least what's causing it?
PLEASE don't say it's the transmission! I just managed to put aside enough
money for guages and some other things and I'd hate to have to spend it on a
tranny.

Sorry for the length and thanks in advance for any help.

Dave
