Subject: [T2] Anyone need factory VW diagrams?

Hey Gang,

Just wanted to let everyone know that I can get print outs of VW microfiche 
drawings for you .  I'd love to have a web site devoted to these images but 
don't have the time to spend uploading the pics.  So, if you are not near a 
dealer and need to see something drop me a line.  Don't know how long this 
opportunity will last.
