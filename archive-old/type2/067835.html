Dumb? NOT
Actually, risking flame myself here, that's brilliant!  I suggested 
to the thermo student studying bus heat improvements that a radiant 
heater might be a good idea.  Place the oil cooler on the FLOOR under 
the driver's feet with an aluminum plate on top. This would provide 
the radiant heat exactly where one needs it.  A small fan could be 
used to circulate some air through the fins if the radiant heat loss 
isn't enough to cool the oil.  One doesn't need to heat the entire 
bus volume to be effective for the driver, just have the heat START 
in the drivers area.

&gt; What if a person installed an external oil cooler on the inside of the bus?
&gt; Would it provide any significant heat once it warmed up? Like a
&gt; radiator-type heater through which steam was piped.
