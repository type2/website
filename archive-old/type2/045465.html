Subject: [T2] those &quot;bug me&quot; videos, how much type2 applications there?

Alright its friday....

So, I saw these 'bug me' videos that show you pretty much everything from 
start to finish on keeping your bug going, what I was wondering is if im in 
some series need on an engine schooling, would these prove to be helpful to 
me?

Mines FI, and im pretty sure they work on just the carb'd machines in the 
videos, but would this be a good learning lesson on maintaining, 
dismantling, etc? or am I better off with the trial and error with my trusty 
manual by my side?

I want to learn, but alas have no father figure or other air cooled buddy to 
get the skills from.

Thanks!
