&gt; &gt;put my spare coil in, replaced the pertronix with points, and changed out
&gt; &gt;the rev limiting rotor for a plain rotor.
&gt;
&gt; What was the spec for the primary resistance of the MSD coil? 0.7 Ohms with any additional ballast resistors?

can't find that anywhere in the specs' was running with a 0.8 resistor in
series but only allowed 10 volts to coil. wired exactly as spec,ed by MSD

&gt; The stock coil is about 3 ohms and what Pertronix recommends for use with the Ignitor. Small resistances can generate high current levels seen at Pertronix module.

got it running now and it sounds real nice and dwell/timing are within
spec's but it still has no power to speak of.   wonder if accel linkage is
moved or stretching ??? just doesn't feel like I'm getting it all... get
my wife later to just sit in the seat and push the pedal while I check.

mystified because it is intermittent
