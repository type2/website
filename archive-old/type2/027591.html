Subject: Re: [T2] misadventures of a vw mechanic wannabe

Must be written somewhere - &quot;You own a bus, you drink gas.&quot; Had the same 
thing happen to me a few years ago while trying to get one started for a 
friend of mine.

After dumping what seemed like a full tank of gas on my head, chest and 
driveway. My buddy leaned down - cigarette in hand - and asked if everything 
was alright. Never in my life have I moved so fast....

&gt;some days, I feel like im getting somewhere, and with my manual by my side 
&gt;I
&gt;can do anything.
&gt;that is, until I don't have my manual by my side, and try to do something I
&gt;assume can only be just as easy as other projects I have taken on.
&gt;The project : replace fuel filter
&gt;The mistake : not reading my manual first
&gt;The outcome : lots of gas all over the place
&gt;I really hate to admit it, but damn this was a dumb, and rather dangerous
&gt;move on my part. I am trying to get ready for my trip to the grand canyon
&gt;from san fran, so I went to change the points/condenser/rotor/oil/oil
&gt;filter - I set the timing, and decided to change the fuel filter since I 
&gt;had
&gt;an extra one and some spare time, after all it couldn't be that hard, or
&gt;take much time.
&gt;I crawled under the bus, found where the old one was and pulled off the
&gt;hose. damnit, the CLAMPS, the CLAMPS!!! ahhhh, grab bucket, place under 
&gt;bus,
&gt;contemplate if the gas will continue to pour out, or just stop when however
&gt;much is in the hose comes through. I realized it was going to continue, so 
&gt;I
&gt;wrapped a towel around my face to help with the fumes, found the hose
&gt;spraying gas, and bent it in half. I tied a rag around it to keep it
&gt;pinched, and grabbed the garden hose. I doused the gas that had spilled 
&gt;onto
&gt;the ground with water, hoping to some higher power that nothing would 
&gt;ignite
&gt;it. I decided to play it safe (sure, now!) and call the FD. They came and
&gt;just decided there wasn't really that much, and hosed the rest of it away
&gt;for me, instead of using any chemicals to spread around on it. I watched
&gt;from the side, my head hung in shame. I now reeked of gas, and had half a
&gt;bucket of it that I don't know what to do with. How do you dispose of
&gt;gasoline properly? I don't think I want to use it, since the bucket had
&gt;little dust and stuff sitting in it when I put it under the bus. I'll 
&gt;figure
&gt;something out, for now, its covered and placed out of the way.
&gt;For future reference, what would have been a good clamping devise? I 
&gt;locking
&gt;pliers perhaps?
&gt;I will never ever make that mistake again.
&gt;My Lesson : RTFM (read the freaking manual)
