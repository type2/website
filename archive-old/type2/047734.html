Subject: [T2] New owner: 1973 VW Camper

Hi all,
Just bought a 1973 VW Camper over the weekend (high roof configuration).  It
has a 1.8L engine which needs some TLC.  Previous owner bought it in B.C.
this summer and drove it back to Ottawa.  Body is very good on it, and
everything on the bottom looks quite solid.  I'll be going over it front to
back during the next couple of days, inventorying things that will need to
be done to it to get it back in full roadworthy shape, in time for next
summer's camping season.  My intent is to take it camping with the kids
around Ottawa.  If it works out well, perhaps I'll think about longer treks
some day.
Glad to be part of this wonderful community.  You can probably look forward
to some questions of mine over the next few weeks as I sort out my to-do
list (I'll scan the archives first, because chances are that the answers to
my questions are probably in there anyway).
Hope to see you on the road some day soon...
  --Robert (1973 Camper - 250,000 miles - I think!)
