Subject: Litchfield show
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Litchfield show was canceled due to the weather, what a bummer!  I drove 200 
miles on Saturday and spent a night at the Days Inn and then the show is 
canceled.
Anybody else out there make the trek?
Supposedly they are going to reschedule for August or September. I wonder tif 
that will be possible?
