Subject: Re: [T2] A few questions...

I use a set of ramps to pull my engine. It gives me tons of room to pull 
my engine .  I have a cart I put the engine on and when I am ready to 
lift the motor into place I slid the jack  under  the cart. I then lift 
engine and cart with no problem. If your bus is not running jack up one 
side of the bus and slide the ramp under the tire and then do the other 
side the same way. I may have a picture of my bus up on the ramps in the 
garage. Let  me look around and I'll post  you a link.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Come to think of it, when I removed the previous engine, I didn't actually
&gt;jack the bus up, I just lowered the motor and (after pulling the single carb off)
&gt;pushed the bus out of the shop (I may have had to lift a little to clear the intake,
&gt;I can't remember...)   
&gt;
&gt;For installation, I thought I'd jack the bus up a little to give me some more room to work.  
&gt;I wasn't sure if the bus needed to be jacked up evenly from a center point.  From the
&gt;responses I'm getting, it sounds like I should jack up 1 side, insert the jack-stand and
&gt;then do the other side.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
