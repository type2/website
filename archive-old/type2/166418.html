Subject: Re: [T2] is the SVDA still the best?

I remember when the megasquirt was first coming up
here on the list a few years back.

I imagine it is quite advanced now.

The engine im working on i think may have deeper
issues that just lack of suitable ignition and
carbueration solutions.

Runs hot and won't do more than 45mph.

Could be the timing i guess. I know its advanced but i
haven't put a light on it yet.

Ongoing...

Thanks guys.

George - there is an NPR program that credits a George
Lyle as...i think a technical engineer. Is that you?

Thanks again, 
Clark

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The only thing we can agree on here is not to
&gt; agree!  :)
&gt; 
&gt; You know, the funny thing was that I *never* thought
&gt; I'd install an 009! 
&gt;   However, it's much easier to modify than the SVDA
&gt; - plus I could care 
&gt; less if I broke it in the process ;)  I'm super
&gt; excited to get spark 
&gt; control, though.  That's gonna be hot!
