Keith,
 Let me be the first to offer you an idea for getting started with your bus.
If you don't have one already,  buy the *Bentley* Official Service Manuel
68-79 I use it everyday, including Sundays.

As for rust, come on!  It's a war, and the rust soldiers aren't sleeping.
The mighty list has strategies to help you with the battle though.

Welcome aboard

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hello list,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My name is Keith Martin and I'm new here.
&gt; &gt; I just bought a 78 bus for $350 two days ago. It was an automatic that
&gt; &gt; has been converted to a standard with a 1600cc upright engine in it. It
&gt; &gt; has it's fair share of rust, being up here in NH and Canada before that.
&gt; &gt; Having owned a 73 beetle, 63 Baja Bug, and 69 Ghia before, i know a
&gt; &gt; little about working on VWs..... but this is my first bus, so i need
some
&gt; &gt; help.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My goal is to have a functional bus that i can take on camping trips and
&gt; &gt; to music festivals. It has just the regular transporter seats right now,
&gt; &gt; but my friend has the cabinets and folding bed from an early 70's westy
&gt; &gt; that we are going to install.
&gt; &gt; It has a solid frame, but quite a bit of surface rust on the bottom and
a
&gt; &gt; few rot holes. I am on a limited budget and have no welding capabilities
&gt; &gt; i want to know how i can stop the rot and fill in the holes.
&gt; &gt; My plan was to sand all the rust and rot and coat it with POR-15, then
&gt; &gt; pop-rivet sheet metal and cover it with bondo. I know i will never have
&gt; &gt; show-winning bus and that isn't what i want.
&gt; &gt; Will this stop the rust?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also.. the PO told me the brake booster servo has a vacuum leak, so he
&gt; &gt; cut and plugged the vacuum line from the engine... i know i need a new
&gt; &gt; vacuum line, but i don't know much about the braking system. It stops
&gt; &gt; when you push really hard on the brake pedal.... how would i go about
&gt; &gt; fixing it?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you in advance for any advice,
&gt; &gt; Peace,
&gt; &gt; Keith
