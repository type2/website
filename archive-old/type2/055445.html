Subject: Running a little funny (ha, ha)

Hello all, I just changed my oil on my 1978 bus all by myself and am
very proud.  First time my husband had to help me but not this time! 
Anyway, my lovely bus is running a little funny, as in peculiar funny,
not ha,ha funny.  When I start it up first thing in the morning or after
it has been sitting a while it will usually die again immediately.  If I
engage the key but don't turn it over for a little bit prior to actually
starting it this will sometimes not happen, and of course if I give it a
lot of gas while starting it it does not happen.  It also runs a little
rough, as if it is kind of thinking about stalling, at idle.  My
mechanic who heartily endorses my doing my own work has suggested it
could be the cold start valve.  Does this sound like a plausible
explanation?  How do I tell if this is actually it?  Sorry if these are
lame questions, but as you can tell I am just learning.  Thanks much,
Beth and the 1978 Hippychickmobile in NJ
