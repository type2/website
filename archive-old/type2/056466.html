&gt;I asked him about possibly installing an oil temp gauge so I could
&gt;monitor, etc. He laughed &amp; told me I shouldn't bother, that it would only
&gt;&quot;scare me&quot;

&gt;got angry.

It's true though! Joe Fournier put an oil temp in his sump and from then on
he was always watching that guage and now he drives like an old lady
(&lt;--sexism  &lt;--ageism  &lt;--sarcasm &lt;--get the rope!). I gather the Berg ones
have an audible ALARM that goes off when your temp gets above 230 or so. If
you have guessed that Berg is waiting to sell external oil coolers to
frightened VW owners, you are very astute. 8)

If I got one it would probably shoot up to 280 and then I'd have to change
my lifestyle or something. Bah. Who needs it. When I break down I like it
to be SPECTACULAR. 8)
