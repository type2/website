Subject: RE: baton passing

And to think I was worried about the weather being a factor when Chad and I
drive half way to Seattle to pick up the baton!
It might be winter when we get it, NEXT winter!
I can't imagine what the box(es) will have in it/them by the time it reaches
Montana.
Patiently waiting....
