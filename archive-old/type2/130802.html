Subject: Re: [T2] can I paint my bus like this?????

Hi Mike,

HVLP = High Volume Low Pressure

Tremclad is a regional equivalent to Rustoleum. An enamel  paint widely 
available (in Canada) with some rust-restoration properties.

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; Mikel,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Home Depot has an HVLP paint system for a bit more than that, and you
&gt;&gt; will be much happier than with the Wagner sprayer. As for me, I am 
&gt;&gt; using
&gt;&gt; Tremclad and a roller to paint my bus.
