Subject: Re: [T2] Help with Master Cylinder replacement

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I just purchased a new (Brazilian) Master Cylinder for my '79 Transporter. I'
&gt; just it hooked back up to the vacuum servo and have the reservoir in place.
&gt;
&gt; My problem is in trying to hook back up the brake lines to the cylinder. The
&gt; couplings on the brake lines don't seem to want to screw into the master
&gt; cylinder at all.
&gt;
&gt; Now, the couplings don't appear to be thread-stripped so my question is are the
&gt; threadings universal? Or do they vary from year to year (or model to model).

Not that I know of, but stranger things have happened.  Measurement is
your best bet!

I've found that brake lines don't like to go in unless everything is
perfectly aligned, both in terms of position and angle.  I wiggle things
around and flex the line slightly until the threads grab, and then
(important!) make sure that I can turn the fitting in by hand before I put
a wrench on it.
