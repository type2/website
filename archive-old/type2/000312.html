Something else to consider might be the oil breather gasket(s). Due to
positive crank case pressure the oil could leak out and be pulled into the
fan housing spraying a fine film of oil inside the housing. The oil then is
passed into the HE's and blue smoke appears. Little droplets of oil should
be notable on the back of the bus after driving, since some of the oil will
be blown through the little hole in the bottom center of the fan housing.
When you stop the engine the residual oil would then leak past the fan
housing since negative pressure isn't created by a turning fan. Come to
think of it the last part of the equation also works for the rear main seal.
Just a thought...

BTW you could drive a hundred miles, blue smoke and all and still not be
able to see much if any change in oil level. It doesn't take much at all to
leave a lasting impression if it goes throug the system as explained...

&gt;&gt; dear list,  I am currently trying to get my '79 westfalia up and running.
&gt;
&gt;SO my question is if not the oil cooler seals, the dipstick &quot;booty&quot;, or
&gt;&gt; the oil cooler (we watched it as we ran the engine NO leak visible), what
&gt;&gt; could be causing a leak at the back end of the engine?  This is
&gt;a recent and
&gt;&gt; sudden development.  No leaks or OIL anywhere prior to this
&gt;&gt; development......HHHMMMMMM          thanks tom
&gt;
&gt;The only other source could be the crankshaft seal. Sitting unused
&gt;for a period can distort an old hard seal.
