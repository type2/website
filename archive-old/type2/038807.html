&gt;In my 72 Westy Campmobile, the small handle on the drawer/cabinet above the

I bought a set of these from Bus Depot that I cannot use.  They were 
described as being grey, which I assumed was the grey used in the late 
1967 through 1971 Westfalias.  What I got is more of an Ivory color 
that is correct for 1972 &amp; 1973 Westfalia only.  1974-1979 handles 
were black.

If anyone needs any of these for a 1972 or 1973 Westy, I would love to 
sell them for what I paid for them and I will pay the postage.  They 
are doing me no good sitting in a bag on my shelf.
