LOL!  We have sure gotten to be a bunch of paranoid folks!&lt;grin&gt;

Ok, my final say on this thread...a cell phone &quot;embeded&quot; somewhere safe
that calls you when the bus is(take your pick,one or more):

Touched
Moved
door opened
started
shifted

Oh...and BTW it would have one of those new GPS funtions built in that 
also gives you it's co-ordinates when you call it back and it answers....

*then* you know what is going on....

So, for about $400 + monthly cell costs, I can build one for anyone that 
wants it....&lt;VBG&gt;....

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; When ever I leave the bus at a trail head or somewhere where its in danger
&gt; &gt; of being messed with I always take the ground strap off and hide it in the
&gt; &gt; bus this way The bus isnt going anywhere.

&gt; Fine idea, but most pro thieves use tow trucks.  Now a hefty chain from
