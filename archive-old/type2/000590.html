&gt; All american / canadian years were water cooled but the original brazilian
fox had a
&gt; 1300cc then a 1600cc aircooled in it.

A bit of a Friday (off-) topic but I'll make it more or less bus related.

I'd never heard of an aircooled Fox. But the origin of the Fox is not
Brazilian. As far as I know this is how VW came to go for water rather than
air and hence how our buses went from aircooled Porsche designed boxers to
the current in-line watercooled engines:

Back in the early seventies VW's marketshare started dropping mainly because
their offerings like the Beetles and the other aircooled cars where now
rather outdated. The 411/412 should have taken over but as you all know this
was a failure (saleswise, but it gave us the more reliable Type 4 engine).

This was the moment when VW acquired AUDI/NSU and incorporated the products
of these companies into the VW brand.
The VW K70 was an original NSU design (watercooled), not a big succes.
However Audi had just developed a small car, the Audi 50, which was just
badge-engineered into the VW Polo (Fox for you) and sold quite well. I'm not
sure whether the Rabbit (Golf here) was also based on an existing Audi
model. I believe the Passat was heavily based on the then existing Audi 80.
Anyway, all the watercooled VW's incorporate a lot of Audi engineering.
That's still the case as all current VW and Audi models are based on the
same 'platforms' (as well as most Seats and Skodas plus the Ford Galaxy(!).

Since most of the new  Audi's have VW counterparts (A2 - Lupo / A3 - Golf /
A4 - Passat) I wonder whether we may ever see an Audi version of the Eurovan
(T4)? Maybe when the new version comes out (Transporter 5, slated for
introduction in 2001/2000)?
