Subject: Re: [T2] Wide five rims?  What width

&gt;Look at the size stamped in the rim. 5.5J14
Bugs were 5&quot; wide.

Thanks.  I found it and they say 5JK14.  Bug
rims?  I thought bug rims were narrower,like
maybe 4 inches, early bus rims were 4.5, and late
bus rims were 5 wide, at least in the early &quot;Wide
Five&quot; pattern wheels.
