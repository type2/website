Subject: Re: [T2] will it go faster this way?

I think it comes from childhood and our first expeiences with 
speed. If you leaned forward on your bike you were more 
aerodynamic and indeed did go faster.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt;Hey everyone!   Happy Friday!!!
&gt;
&gt;Time for Fridays crazy question...
&gt;Why is it that when you see someone driving a bus down the 
highway at full speed,  they are always leaning so far 
forward that their head is almost hitting the windshield?  
When I used to drive my 67 deluxe down the highway in 
California, I found myself doing the same thing!  Surely the 
seat is far enough forward in a bus to be able to &quot;sit back 
and enjoy the ride.&quot;  I think bus owners deep down inside 
believe that if you lean far enough forward, your own body 
weight will somehow make you go faster!  Try this theory out 
on the highway sometime.  When you find yourself starting to 
lean, are you saying &quot;Come on Bessie, you can do it!&quot;? Once 
again, questions, comments and stories welcome.
