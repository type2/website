Getting the bus ready for the first camping trip.  Checking out stove/fridge/sink/etc to figure out how everything works, and I'll be damned but I don't have the key for the fresh water inlet.  Anybody have any ideas short of drilling it out?  If I do have to drill it out, is there an easy way?  Usually, I like to try the hard way first, but I'm a little short on time.  Also, who has these little goodies?
Oh, and if anybody knows what is special about a wolfsburg edition, Im curious.  Took off the bra for first time, saw two emblems...whaddayaknow!
Thanks in advance
