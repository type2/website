Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Modern Brake Switch

Hi Adam,

Good post, very informative.

But personally I can't see a deficiency in the original switch design.

Why is it a problem if the switch doesn't come on until pressure builds in
the master cylinder?? A bus isn't going to start to slow down until this
pressure builds. That's when the signal is needed.

The deficiency here is not in the design of the bus, it's with the driver of
the vehicle following. There are very few things one can do to a bus to
rectify the problem in someone else's vehicle. Sending an early and
potentially false signal is not going to smarten up a tailgater, it will
make things worse as they try to second-guess you.

Personally, I'd sooner rig a &quot;James Bond&quot; style oil sprayer to deter
tailgaiters than to modify my brake lighting system. YMMV.

Happy trails,

&gt; The way the witch works on 'modern' brakes:
&gt; The switch is a &quot;on&quot; when not depressed, &quot;off&quot; when pressed.
&gt; A little mounting bracket holds said switch against the pedal arm,
&gt; Which in modern vehicles is above the pedal, thus under the dash. (in a bus
&gt; situation, I figure you're gonna have to put it under the floor).
&gt; Push the pedal, the arm leaves the switch, lights &quot;on&quot;.
&gt; It's a really simple circut.
&gt; Now, a warning, anything to do with messing with brake lights is dangerous
&gt; business. One trick we did with my dads race car is we wired in a warning
&gt; light on the dash that warned him when he was &quot;riding&quot; the brakes, but it
&gt; also meant he knew when the lights were on.
&gt; If I was re-wiring my brake lights, I would consider a small LED to do this
&gt; same function. I'd sleep better for sure...but that's just me.
