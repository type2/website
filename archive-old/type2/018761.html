hey all...
I went to Bugfest 99 in WI yesterday and i must say I was impressed.
There weren't a ton of V-dubs....but enough of them.  I think I saw more
modified ones than anything else.  But one guy with a splitty had wooden
bumpers that he had had for 15 years.  They were beautiful!  Another guy
with a splitty had a wood-burning stove in his bus....he basically lived
in the thing.  It was very cool though!  There were many busses for sale
too.  We met a couple of people with '73 and '75 westies....they were
very cool! them and the busses!  After we got to talking, we went to
camp at Bong Recreational Area.  Yes that is the name of the
park....look on the map of southern wisconsin...its there.  anyways...we
went camping and had a fire and listened to their band, and made
burgers, listened to a TON of Grateful Dead bootlegs and just had a
great time.  The one guy had a screen for the back cargo hatch for when
its up...to keep the bugs out.  He had an extra one so he gave it to me
in exchange for booking his band for some shows.  Did the cargo hatch
size change from 71 to 75 at all??  It seems to work nicely, but I have
yet to install the buttons that clip it on onto my bus.  Are these rare
at all?  I don't think they are, but I haven't seen many of them...
What kind of buttons (snaps) should I use for this?  I just need to put
them on the cargo hatch area of my bus as the screen already has them
on.  Should I put some sort of seal (o-ring?) under them when I screw
them on?  Where can I get these snaps that screw in?  or if I could find
some that would glue on rrreeeaaalllyyy good...

well....were any of you at MOFOCO's Bugfest 99 in Union Grove
yesterday??  I think I may have gotten on TV! yay!  wouldn't be the
first time...

There was a 75? 74?  bus that was drag racing there against some
souped-up camaro there!  it was just for laughs and EVERYONE was
cheering him on!  It had 300,000+ miles on it too and still went very
nicely!  by the end of the 1/4 mile he was doing over 60...or was it 1/8
mile??  I don't remember...but his acceleration was still GREAT along
with everything else...except the rust on the body...
anyways...
enough rambling...

-71 hardtop westy

oh yeah....on my westy interior...the tag says &quot;SO 63&quot; then after that
it says &quot;19 67&quot;  what does this mean??  the &quot;67&quot; part might not be
right, but its 60-something....the last number is kind of corroded....
thanks!
