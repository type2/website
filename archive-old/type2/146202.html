Subject: Re: [T2] One version of why we are &quot;orphans&quot; of VW

&gt; Fortunately, Philly is home to a law firm that has its own VW-only

&gt; confidently expect a full buy-back.

My wife's co-worker had a Touareg that was constantly in the  
dealership for little things including CEL. Eventually she became  
tired of the visits and insisted on a new vehicle but the dealership  
fought her over it.

She contacted a lemon lawyer, they bought back the vehicle and she  
bought a new vehicle from another marque.

When Consumer Reports does their reliability surveys, the best cars  
almost universally come out of Japan and the worst from USA/Germany.

My wife's Acura will be 10 years old next March. We had to visit the  
dealer ZERO times during the 4 year warranty period. During the last  
six we've been there 3 times (muffler, cv joint, EVAP valve). The  
last one was even replaced under a warranty extension because it was  
emissions related. It still gets the 32mpg; the oil consumption has  
gone from zero for the first 7 years to mild/moderate.

My expectation for our next daily driver have been set so high I  
can't imagine going with a non-Japanese made vehicle when we  
eventually retire this one. Given the high price of cars these days,  
it's shocking what problems you inherit with your $40k investment.
