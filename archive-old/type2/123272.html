Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Oil on Concrete Garage Floor

Barry,

10 million ways to do this...

Go to google and enter      garage floor oil cleaner

My personal favorite is 409 sprayed and wiped....Dawn has some
new stuff that I bought, but haven't tried on my floor yet, but their
commercials for it on greasy cookware are incredible.

Anything that will emulsify or absorb(like kitty litter)the oil/grease is 
good.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I have tried scrubbing one of the oil spills on my hands and knees with hot 
&gt; water and Tide , but there is still enough oil on this first spot to be too 
&gt; slippery to walk on.
