Subject: Fuel Injection woes


Has anyone experience of reversing the two multi connector plugs that attach
to the fuel injector relay?  My son seems to have reversed them.  On
appearance the two plugs are physically identical, white, and about 1 inch
square.  Although the female receptacles appear to be laid out the same, the
male terminals under the f.i.. relay are different in number.  The number of
wires going into each plug are different also.  If the plugs are reversed,
is damage to the relay possible?  Thanks for your experiences.  The other
suggestion I have heard is that the ground wires to the terminals on the
left side of the air inlet neck might be missing, although I don't think it
was necessary to undo any when the engine came out, but my memory could well
be faulty.
