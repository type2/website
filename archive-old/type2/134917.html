Subject: Re: [T2] 73-79 Rim size?

Actually what I getting at, not trying to fit a 15&quot;.  I'm putting a Bay beam
in my Split with 79 Disc brakes.  I'd rather run 14&quot; rims, but the split
window 14&quot; rims don't look like they will clear the rotors even with the
adapters (to bring it back from 5x100 to 5x205).
I've seen some nice 15&quot; bay rims on the market, mainly like the BRM's from
the west coast and England for a Bay bus.  it must be the offset of the Bay
rims that allow 14&quot; rims to clear the rotors.  I could run the Bays all the
way around, the rear is a IRS using Bay housings and arms.  Right now it has
the wide 5 from a 70, but I have the complete housing and hubs from the 79 I
bought.

&gt; TONS of this info in the archives...
&gt;
&gt; 14&quot; for all baywindow busses. Starting in 1971 I think they went from the
&quot;Wide-5&quot; lug pattern to a 5x112mm pattern.
&gt;
&gt; Because your next question &lt;grin!&gt; will be where can you get 15&quot; wheels or
whatelse fits - look at Mercedes (fits with right offset),
Audi/Eurovan/Passat (dubious offset), Vanagon (good - but don't think VW
sold 15&quot; wheels, just aluminum 14&quot; wheels).
&gt;
&gt; I have a set of 15&quot; Mercedes BBS rims I got from eBarf for a good price.
15&quot; rims are not popular on Mercedes so these are not desireable to those
folks, they want 16&quot; and 17&quot; rims.
&gt;
&gt; www.gowesty_dot_com has some options, and several of the online tire suppliers
(i.e. Tire Rack, Discount Tires) will sell you Mercedes rims. Just don't
tell them what you are going to put them on... They don't want the liability
when you put these rims on something they don't agree with. Check the
Mercedes specs, some that these wheels fits are as heavy or heavier than our
vans. I think they will be fine.
