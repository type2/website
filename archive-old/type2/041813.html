Subject: 1600 CC Oil strainer

Just changed oil  for the third time on my new engine.The first time I used a 
kit given to me by the shop that installed my engine.This time I used a 
gasket/washer kit and strainer  that I bought at a local foreign car shop, or 
at least I attempted to. Gaskets fit fine, but I couldn't get the strainer to 
go on go without really banging on it which I didn't do. When I took it back 
off I held it &quot;back to back&quot; against the one I was taking off, I found that 
the six holes didn't quite match up. I probably could have forced it on, but 
my past hobby (sailboats) taught me that forcing anything is usually asking 
for trouble. I was worried that making the holes bigger, might make an 
already prone to dripping situation worse, even with two gaskets. I also 
noticed that the mesh strainer was not nearly as fine, and that concerned me 
to. I just cleaned the old one (it wasn't really dirty), and put it bak on 
with the new gaskets. My question is this. Did I likely get some after market 
cheapie? And if so should I avoid these things and how can I make sure I'm 
getting the best quality I can get when buying things for my new bus? I guess 
it could have been my imagination, and I'm new at this stuff, but I was 
suspicious of the quality, especially when it didn't quite fit.
