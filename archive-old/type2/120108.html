Here's the whole NGK coding scheme for a BPR5ES/A plug that comes stock
in new mexican engines:

The B is the thread diameter, always B for AC VWs

The &quot;P&quot; is the letter that means &quot;projected&quot;  It can be omitted if the
plug is standard reach.

The &quot;R&quot; indicates a resistor plug.  It can be omitted for a standard
plug.

The number is the heat range.  Higher numbers are colder.

The &quot;E&quot; is the reach.  If you have 1/2 inch reach plugs you want &quot;H&quot;, if
you have 3/4 inch reach plugs you want &quot;E&quot;.

The &quot;S&quot; indicates a standard center electrode.  This is what you want.

The &quot;/A&quot; indicates a special electrode design.  This is what comes in the
new Mexican engines, but I can't find out what is special about the VW
design.
