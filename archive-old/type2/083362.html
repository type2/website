Subject: Westy rack


was written***************************************
I want to put a rack on top of my '78 Westy to haul a
canoe, or lumber occasionally. Any ideas?
Richard
'78 Westy 'Elvis'

I put a rack on top of my pop top (79 Westy) using
Yakima 'side loaders' and a standard Yakima roof rack
system. With this setup I can put just about anything
on the roof including a Thule top box that we use for
the longer road trips top carry the gear up top and
not inside. With a canoe attachment that Yakima sells,
it would be no problem to carry a canoe on top.
You can see photos of my westy with the top box at my
photo site:
