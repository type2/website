Yeah, I like that one too. Trying on big brother's sunglasses. (He thinks
he's in The Matrix or something. LoL!)

My wife was talking on the phone to her aunt tonight. Pretty funny listening
to her talk herself into loving the bus again, during the course of a 10
minute conversation! Starts out: &quot;Yeah, it's old and seems to break all the
time...&quot; Then, &quot;Well, 99% of the time Don can fix it in just a few minutes.&quot;
Finally, &quot;Yeah, I love that bus. It's just so perfect for trips!&quot;
