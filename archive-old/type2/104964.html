Color doesn't matter specificly.  It's standard though for fuses to come
color-coded.  White, Red, Blue, Yellow.  It's very important that you only
replace a fuse that should be 8 amp with a fuse that is 8 amp.  These
colors have often faded by the time we get'm but they should be
distinguishable.

If you have two blue fuses where you should instead have one white fuse
and one blue fuse you need to correct this!!  These fuses are there to
help prevent electrical shorts from causing damage.

According to the standard:
Yellow = 5 amp
White = 8 amp
Red = 16 amp
Blue = 25 amp

Our fuses are ceramic or plastic with a strip of metal running from end to
end.
