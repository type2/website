Subject: RE: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

	Dudes/Dudy-ettes:

	John Rogers: Doncha know asbestos suit wearing can cause
mesothelioma?

	Ron Salmon &amp; Others: As for those of you passing things with yer
busses, I &quot;think&quot; if you squeeze the fox hard enough, he might just pass a
gas station!

	I can't stop ROTFLMAO as I was reading this thread - Happy Friday to
all!

	Aye-yi-yi... still wiping off the tears, with some 20/20 Hindsight
brand tissues.
