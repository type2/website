Subject: Re: [T2] Door buzzer idea

Richard,

You could go back to the original wiring (which buzzes when the door is
open) and add a different buzzer for when the lights are on and the engine
is off.  See:

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/037922.html

(Adding a small piezoelectric buzzer to the headlight switch with minimal
(none!) hacking into the wiring.)

A very elegant, easy and inexpensive way to avoid those
&quot;I-left-my-lights-on-and-needa-jump&quot; blues.  8^)

This works great.  Thanks to Barry B.

Subject: [T2] Door buzzer idea


&gt; I've had the door buzzer relay removed since last July because it was
&gt; driving me nuts. Last week I locked my keys in the bus which probably
would
&gt; have been avoided by the buzz. Today I left the lights and an almost
didn't
&gt; have enough battery left to turn the engine over.
&gt;
&gt; It got me thinking that it would be handy to re-use the buzzer as a
warning
&gt; for the lights.
