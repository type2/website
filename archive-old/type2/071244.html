Please excuse me for jumping into this thread but I had to through out
my
2 cents worth.  It sounds like you need to back the choke off a bit.
Last
winter (if you can say we have a winter here in TX) when it got cold I
cranked
up the choke so that it would idle fast when it was cold.  This worked
while
it was idling but when I went to drive it, it would just sputter and act
like
someone kept turning off the gas.  The problem was actually that I was
flooding it out until it warmed up enough for the choke to open up and
allow more air in. HTH

disclaimer:  I have no idea if this pertains to your problem.......

You can do that? Hm. You know, I thought it was odd, that mine
_absolutely
won't move_  until it warms up for at least 5-7 minutes. It will sputter
and die until it's thoroughly warmed up. I know there's something wrong
with it, but I don't know what... :(
