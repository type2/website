&gt;&gt; there seems to be a lot of talk about the rarity of buses.  I live in
&gt;&gt; Seattle, and you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a bus here.  They
&gt;&gt; are everywhere.  I have three on my block alone.  I see aobut 20-25 of them a
&gt;&gt; day, not counting Vanagons (which seem rarer).  Maybe we just have a glut
&gt;&gt; and I should keep quiet about it or risk losing them all :)

&gt;How many are splitties, though? It would be good to know there is an 
&gt;abundance of these somewhere. I'm guessing there aren't 50 of 
&gt;these vans left in Eugene/Springfield... or they are VERY well hidden. 
&gt;You see one about every 2 weeks.

Here in Indiana, where rust runs rampant, you RARELY see a splittie. In
fact, I can't remember the last time I saw one!
