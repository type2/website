&gt; Thanks all for the replies on troubleshooting options. After
&gt; I finish this major project that brings in the income that
&gt; makes me able to afford this addiction of mine (VWs - I'm
&gt; sure you understand :-), I'll advise what I find... and I'm
&gt; sure I'll have more questions, as this is my first FI
&gt; engine.
&gt; 
&gt; I appreciate your voices of experience and encouragement to
&gt; keep a cool head (pun intended) in the process of
&gt; resurrecting this old girl.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
