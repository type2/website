Subject: Re: [T2] Book Timing or Mechanics Advice Timing????

Your mechanic is smoking crack... and you're engine will soon be
smoking, too.

Time your distributor according to what MODEL ENGINE you have, not the
distributor.

However, if you've got an aftermarket distributor, you probably want
your total max advance to go no higher than what a stock distributor on 
that engine would time to.

make sense?

&gt; I finally got the correct distributor with two vacuum hoses for my
&gt; '73 manual transmission with CB engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Haynes says at idle time it 10 ATDC for automatic,  5 ATDC for
&gt; manual.  The library says 10 ATDC for a CB engine. The mechanic says
&gt; time it at 38 BTDC at high idle.
&gt; 
&gt; 38 BTDC gives great power but pings at low RPM.  5 ATDC gives less
&gt; ping at low RPM with a slight loss of power.  10 ATDC pings verrrrry
&gt; slightly at low RPM but with less power again.
