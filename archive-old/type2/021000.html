Re the donut tire, I got one of these from a junkyard bus and used it
(1) on the roof rack while I had a home made bike rack up front (2) put
it on the front tire mount with its homemade cover when I got the bike
rack for the rear.  Looked cool up front and the smaller size allowed
more cooling air throught the vent scoop usually blocked about 40% by
the stock tire.  However, it was a nuisance to blow up- tended to offset
itself in a wierd way unless you sat on it as it inflated; cracked
unsafely at the severe fold bends, and was no fun to deflate.  I can see
why the Westfalia full rear bed option with the donut tire hiding in the
rear closet only lasted 2 years (73-74?).  I ended up keeping a full
size tire on the rack, with the rear sticking up on the edge of the
rack.  Then it went on the front.  The stock place in the 78 cabinet was
cut flush and hinged to form a cavity for all my tools kept in Sears 22&quot;
truck tool boxes, perfect length.  MB 78 Westy
