Subject: Re: [T2] '71 has a wierd glitch

Here's my guess. Fuel pump can't keep up &amp; the bowl is getting low.
What happens when you realease the throttle then press it again it the
accel pump is given an extra chance to push a little more gas.

&gt; miles: With the engine pretty well loaded, like climbing a slight hill in 
&gt; top gear, accelerator 1/2 to 3/4 of the way down, the engine momentarily 
&gt; cuts out. No noise, no funkiness, just a sharp, momentary drop in power, 
&gt; which causes the bus to lurch briefly until I let up on the accelerator.
