Subject: mysterioso electrics-`76 type4

The List:

It all started on the way back from Ted Finemean's  in Cinncinnati after
helping Dan wrench in his new Beetlemex dual port (a beauty, but another
story altogether). Picture this: crusing down I75 into the onramp for
I74 and home when...everything electrical goes, lights engine radio, the
works( btw it's around 2am at this point) f****** pitch black, no
shoulder, big trucks!! then BAM! the engine backfires on the loaded up
gas and everything is  operational again !!! This is  very unerving.

At this point I am loathe to stop  and check out whtever the hell is
going on and manage to get home with no further near death experiences,
and now need to sort this out. Here's what I know:

* idiot lights may or may not come on - it's like this : turn on key -no
idiot lights,no nothin. Sit quietly, touch nothing, wiggle NO wires,
don't do a damn thing and *CLICK* everthing pops on - sometimes... this
may take a minute or it may take an hour!! WUWT!

*all fuses are good

*all underdash wires entact and clean

* starter won't kick - I have 12v to the bolt terminal, but nuthin else.
The starter is a bosch rebuild less than a year old - tests good out of
the bus.

* battery good - tests 12.6v with multimenter

Now obviously I have an intermittent short - but I stumped finding the
thing.
What I need from you folks is input, tell me how you deal with
electrical gremlins, tips, procedures,voodoo, whatever,  give me your
collective knowlege! Pmail to me or post it if it's good. Thanks in
advance, I know you'll come through.
