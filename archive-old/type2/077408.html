&gt; Looks like snow in the Truckee/Reno area. I know
&gt; several list members are familiar with that
&gt; troublesome moutain stretch.

If the snow if flying, or even if it is threatening, stay nice and warm at
home!

In a day or two the weather will be beautiful and the roads dry.  A few
years back I made the mistake of trying to beat a storm over the Sierras.
Starting from LA, I had to chain up and unchain _4_ times in 200 miles
before I got to Independence and gave up for the night.  The next morning
the sky was crystal blue and the roads quickly dried.

That taught me a lesson.  It's better to be at home wishing you were on
the road than to be on the road wishing you had stayed at home!
