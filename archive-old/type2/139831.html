I have to agree that you should get the window fixed, if for no other
reason than to prevent folks from easily vandalizing it.  that way if
something happens it is &quot;breaking and entering&quot;

&gt; paint it, so I'll be interested if anyone has used
&gt; Maaco, what the results were, the $$$ cost for paint,
&gt; and whether they really do try and hose you for prep
&gt; charges (although I know that prep is the most
&gt; important part if you want it to come out decently) so
&gt; your comments and suggestions are most welcome..

yes they hose you for the prep.   my take on getting it painted,  find a
place where you won't be bothered, some unused parking lot on a Sunday
etc.    get a dozen rattle cans some tape and some newspaper,  tape it up
and paint it with quick dry paint from a can and when done, sit down have
lunch (don't forget a mask and clean up supplies) and a soda...then start
carefully taking off the masking and put it into a trash bag.  it may not
be #1 but it will at least be uniform and will help stop the rust a
little. try not to jerk the neighbors chain by painting it shocking pink
or anything...it could take a nice long day, help from a friend with
another vehicle that can go get what you forgot would be usefull otherwise
borrow a bike or something just in case.

Good luck

Bob
