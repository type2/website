Subject: Re:Help identifying a part

Hi Jason,

Yes, I agree someone has added a hard start relay to the system.
Specifically, that appears to be a F*RD starter solenoid of the
70's-80's vintage.  This is not to be confused with beloved Bosch hard
start relay so ubiquitous on our busses but it will certainly fit the
bill, if wired correctly.

Peace,
Bill

Can someone identify the electrical part on the lower-left of this
photo?

On the right of the photo is the starter/solenoid, and this picture was
taken with my feet sticking out from under the right side of the Bus.

Thanks!
