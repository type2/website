I'm off tomorrow to find the sun (and some parts and to pick up my new
tranny).

I'm going to Anaheim to pick up my tranny from Rancho and then over 
to Phoenix to find some sunshine and leach off my brother for a few 
days.  My question, is there some FLAPS in either of these places or 
in between where I could finds some misc Type 2 and vanagon parts 
like rear motor mounts etc at a reasonable price?

Thanks for your help
