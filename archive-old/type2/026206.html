	&gt;&gt;If you adjust them clockwise you have to overcome the buildup of
pressure 
	&gt;&gt;(compression) in each stroke. &lt;&lt;

	Another newbie question:  Is is normal practice to look at your
plugs every 
	oil change and valve adjustment?  If so, having the plugs out will
let the 
	air escape and then no compression.  Still learning...

As far as I'm concerned the only good reasons for taking the spark plugs out
are: its time to replace them; you are playing with your carburation and
need to find how clean you're burning; or if you question your compression.
I'm a believer in, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;  Just do regular
maintenance to keep it that way.  I've had a spark plug strip out 100 miles
from home (P/O cross threaded it) and don't like to tempt fate by taking
plugs out just because.
