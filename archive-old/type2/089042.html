Subject: Re: [T2] airflow sensor on a 77 Westy

How much higher?

What part number is on the cover? Original was 0 280 200 018.
This was superceded by 0 280 200 020 in 78. The 020 replaced the 018 and will
work on mid 76 and 77.
And sometimes covers get switched.....

&gt; Recently I checked the flow sensor on my 77 Westy, and the resistance
&gt; values came up a little higher then the range of specs in the Bently
&gt; Manual.  Is this OK or is the sensor bad.  Also the flow sensor is a
&gt; rebuild (originally a Bosh) and the part number doesn't match what the
&gt; Bently manual has.  Is this possibly a problem?
&gt;
&gt; thanks
&gt;
&gt; Andy
