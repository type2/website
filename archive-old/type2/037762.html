Subject: red light and severed wire

Last fall I was driving along when the red light on my speedometer(1965)
went on.  I stopped, checked everything, and found that the red wire from
the generator to the voltage regulator was severed at the v.r. end.  There
was a little overheating in the wire but not enough to burn through.  My
battery was also on its last month.
My question is this:
Are there any other components that might have been adversely affected by
the aforementioned situation?  For example: coil, generator, voltage
regulator??

On a different note, are there any good resources out there on tuning a
carburetor?  I have a Solex H30/31Pict.

Any help would be gratefully appreciated!
Thanks,
Cevin
