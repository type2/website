Subject: re Full Flow filters for upright engine 

i use a ph8 on my 1600 dp no probs, although i didnt have to drill into 
anything, CB performance sells an oil pump that bolts right onto the engine, 
it fits perfectly in between the engine mustache bar, and the oil pump,  i 
think the name of the pump is &quot;maxxi&quot; i forget now, but i was happy not to 
have to drill.  peace .. scott 71 vesty
