Subject: [T2] Reassembly...

Hi all -

Motor goes in TODAY!  I 'spose some, citing Muir's sage advice regarding 
keeping track while dismantling, may have 'tsk tsk-ed' when I queried about 
vacuum hoses.  Well, unfortunately, I had an &quot;Ace mechanic&quot; who was going to 
work on the van.  His initiative &amp; motivation carried him far enough to take 
off:  AFM, air intake distributor, intake pipes, &amp; all hoses.  This was over 
the course of 2 1/2 weeks.   When the pungent smoke cleared, he was taken 
off the case.  This work is something I had wanted to do, but lacked the 
space/time/knowledge.  I then found time by quitting my j-o-b, &amp; opted to 
put in a rebuild myself.  This is all being done in a driveway at a house 
where I'm not staying.  Enough rambling...

Anyhow, a few specific hose questions:  1) where do all the teensy-weensy 
hoses from a) distributor, b) throttle housing, c) intake air distributor 
go? 2) what hose hooks up to the left (FIF)/EGR/cold start valve side of the 
air intake distributor?

I've scoured the archives, but am coming up empty.  I did find a link to an 
FI site where I can see/fill in some spots that are on the borders of the FI 
photos.

Thank you,

Mark, '80 Westy, &quot;Freedom Enterprise&quot;
