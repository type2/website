Subject: Window removals

How do you remove a window or glass in a Bay / Vanagon when the window
has an exposed edge??

Attach a large vice grip pliers to the window edge, Tighten and PULL
the vice grips towards you.      (replacement is the opposite of
removal!!  -  Tony of NJ would probably use a rock or hammer, but vice
grips are really easier!!!)

How do you remove, in one piece, the front door vent window GLASS.
Just the glass??  In 30 seconds or less..... (no cheating with the
vice grips....)

Insert a thin flat blade screwdriver's blade between the chrome
'channel' and the edge of the glass, at the top point of the
channel/glass, but at the BASE of the channel, and make a space
between the glass and the chrome.  You can move the chrome channel
piece up and away from the glass quite a bit, and then grab the glass
at the top, near the screwdriver and pull the glass out.  If the glass
is really stuck, another item can be used between the air space of the
vent glass and the chrome channel to coax the glass out.

One or two times, and you can almost to it in one breath..
Ray,  I am with you.....
