Hi Shannon
I'm not sure of the name, think it's maybe Graco, but it's a booster seat that
the 
child sits on and an arm comes down on the childs lap.Can only be used with
lap
belts. Seen it alot in childrens second hand stores but I'm sure its available
new.
Got a 3yr old so I'm right behind you.
Your right, some don't understand, unless your driving a Volvo with everywhich
way
airbags you must be a bad parent. 'course they might learn to drive, sorry
hurt myself
