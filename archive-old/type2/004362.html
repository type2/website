&gt; Ok   In my bus (and in the picture on the link I attached) there is a slot
&gt; at the bottom of the fridge for something to slide in to. On the super
&gt; original 72 in my link (which is on VWplanet classifieds right now
&gt; www.thesamba_dot_com ) there IS a big tray there as if a vegetable crisper or
&gt; something. http://www.72camper_dot_com/3936.jpg
&gt; If this tray is not original what are the slots for? A rack? It sure looks
&gt; original.
&gt; I do have the metal basket at the top and a drip tray that has a tube that
&gt; goes to the grey water tube, whick also shows up in the above link.
&gt; There are actually a bunch of slots in my fridge and it still has the
&gt; Campmobile sticker on it so I know its original. Any help is appreciatted
&gt; and I still want the tray if its original or whatever was!!

I have drip trays and I have the ice racks. That is all that came originally
in the cooler.
That 'tray' in the picture has to be from something else.

&gt; &gt; There is a plastic coated tray to hold ice.  There is a drip pan that
&gt; &gt; goes under the ice tray.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Rob;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Are you sure that tray is an original part?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I spent several years traveling and camping in an identical '72
&gt; &gt; &gt;Campmobile,
&gt; &gt; &gt;right down to the color, and I don't remember such a tray.  My buddy
&gt; &gt; &gt;was the
&gt; &gt; &gt;original owner of the bus, and he bought it off the showroom floor.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I've owned both a '68 and a '70 Campmobile since 1978.  I was/am the
&gt; &gt; &gt;2nd
&gt; &gt; &gt;owner of both, and neither bus has that tray.  I don't believe it
&gt; &gt; &gt;shows up
&gt; &gt; &gt;in the Westfalia Campmobile manual, either.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;FWIW.....

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  The second thing I need is the tray that goes in the bottom of my
&gt; &gt; &gt;fridge.  &lt;&lt;
