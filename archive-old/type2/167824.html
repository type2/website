Subject: Re: [T2] 40+MPG? Water injection??

&gt;  &gt;I was just reading about this Water Injection stuff and it really seems
&gt;interesting. Adding water and alcohol to the fuel and air mix cools down
&gt;the cylinder and BOOSTS the octane while to increase overall fuel
&gt;efficiency... I have GOT to be missing a critical component of why this
&gt;concept is flawed, because I cannot understand why this concept was not
&gt;widely adopted by more auto manufacturers&gt;&gt;&gt;

	You seem to be assuming that the auto mfrs are rational. 
Better face the fact that the history of commercial technology is not 
merely littered with irrationalities but dominated by them.

&gt;
&gt;You don't ave enough compression or ponies to make the bus fly with an
&gt;water / alcohol injection system.
&gt;
&gt;All's the water will do is prevent pre-ignition, and maybe clean the
&gt;carbon outa your valve train.

	It will do those.  Even for a low-CR engine that is worthwhile. 

&gt;
&gt;It won't do anything to benifit a low compression engine.

	I'm happy to tell you this is incorrect.  Even low-comp, 
low-revving engines do benefit from WI  --  see e.g the report from 
The Silver Snail in my article 
http://www.dave-cushman_dot_net/misc/mannject.html
.
	Actually the first engines with WI, a century ago, had CR 
down around 4:1 and benefitted if only from improved cooling (an 
effect us airhowler fans should not ignore).

	In an age of outrageous hype, WI sounds too good to be true. 
But it isn't.
