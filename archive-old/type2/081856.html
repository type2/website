Subject: Lights go dim

My bus is running pretty strong after the newly installed engine,

but now the alt light comes on dimly when idling/driving and lights go dim
and then bright and my stereo (connected directly to the battery) flickers
and even goes off. It doesn't seem to matter whether I gun the engine, etc.

I replaced the voltage regulator and coil. The alternator is a new Bosch
rebuilt (from a FLAPS) put on with the engine swap and the belt is tight.
The battery is a real nice Optima red top and is only a few months old.

Any ideas what to look for or what could be causing this. I haven't added
anything electrical recently. I don't have a volt meter or anything except a
test light.

Also how unsafe is it for me to drive the bus like this? Its my only
transportation, and at the least I would need to go get any new parts in it.

Thanks!!
