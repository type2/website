Subject: [T2] Setting Total Advance Without Degree Wheel

Hello everyone--

Thanks to all who helped with my Generator Light problem--it took a little 
fumbling with the wires and it stopped lighting up---Have a question about 
Total Advance. I have a 71 stock 1600 DP with a 009 Distributor and I want to 
set my total advance--How can I do this without a Degree Wheel--I believe it 
is supposed to be set at 27 Degrees for my engine---any thoughts? thanks--
