Adam:

Sounds like a shift rod bushing problem.  On most busses, at least 1, if not all, the bushings are gone.  If you replace them, the shifter tightens up dramatically.  Also, if you want a shorter throw on the shifter, try a short shift kit, which will cost under $10 and about an hour or 2 to install.  Make sure you get the metal short shift kit, as opposed to the plastic one.
