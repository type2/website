&gt; Hey Y'all, I was wondering what the census is on battery sizes?  I only have
&gt; one, and it was 400 Cold Cranking Amps, the new one is 525 CCA.  Is this too

think of it as a big barrel with a spigot on it.

the size of the spigot is the amount of power you draw off.
the size of the faucet that fills the barrel back up is the chargeing
system
and the size of the battery is how many gallons the battery will hold.

CCA is a measure of the size of the Battery. and it does not matter as
long as the spigot doesn't change (voltage regulator) controls how much
goes in,  rest just doesn't get pumped (or made by alt).  the draw of the
equipment up to the amp limit is the amount that will come out the spigot.

so having a battery with more CCA really doesn't have an effect on how
much goes in how fast or how much can come out, only how much it can hold.

(obviously the example is very simplified, but you get the idea)

me I have two 1,000CCA batteries in my van.  I ski and when I go out on
the mountain at 10 below I want her to START! and part of that is the
ability to crank, and a cold engine wants more.
