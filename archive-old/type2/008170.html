Can anybody tell me how the heater controls work on an 83 Vanagon? (other
&gt; than very poorly)

&gt; What I think I've figured out so far is that the top slider directs air
&gt; either to the windshield (Defroster/Defoggers), the heater (below radio) or
&gt; to the cabln heat duct behind the driver.
&gt; 
You are correct here.  The top slider determines which vents you get hot air from.  The basic choices are:  front footwell vents and walk-through floor vent; front footwell vents only; and defrost vents (on top of dashboard and at right and left edges of dashboard on top) only.  This goes from left to right if I remember correctly.



&gt; The next slider is for the temperature and controls the flapper valves.
&gt; 
Exactly.  

&gt; The third slider is called a main flap control and I have no clue about its
&gt; function.
&gt; 
This controls the fresh air flaps.  This slider determines whether the fresh air intake flaps are open or closed.  Fresh air comes out through the two vents on each side of the dash, below the instrument panel on the driver's side and above the glovebox on the passenger side.  Only fresh air comes from these vents.


&gt; The fourth slider look as though it directs air to the vents along the roof
&gt; line in the passenger area.
&gt; 
That's exactly what it does.  It basically controls whether fresh air is allowed to pass into the rear roof area.  If you have a Westy, there are only roof vents on the passenger side.  Regular vans have them on both sides.  The air is ducted from the front of the van through the front doors, up the insides of the B-pillars and into the roof ducts.


&gt; Is this right or am I off on this. Does the fan switch have anything to do
&gt; with heated air at all? 

No.  The electric blower fan is only for moving fresh air.

or is all hot (warm) air pushed along solely by the
&gt; engine fan.

You've got it.
