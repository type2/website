purchasing a
&gt; Carver P4 propane heater, p-mail me for pricing and information.

Has anyone installed a Carver heater in a non-camper bus?  I'd like to
put one in my 7-passenger, but can't really think of where I would
mount the unit.  I wouldn't mind adding the propane tank if I could
get good heat!

OTOH, should I be looking for a gas heater?
