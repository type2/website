Subject: 78 westy sink drain 

I have a 78 westy in process of restoration
and am not sure of the best way to remove the
sink/stove cabinet for access to the floor.
The sink drain has a threaded cap fitting at the
outlet, and empties directly over and very close to
an a/c condenser, between two 12v. fans (all original).
What were they thinking?? I assume the cap is to
keep mice out, it seems to have no other function.

It appears I will have to sawzall the drain tube
at this lower fitting in order to remove the cabinet,
and may not have enough length left to glue it back on.
Has anyone else had this dilemna? (and solved it :)?

Has anyone ever fitted a gray-water tank for the drain?
This westy also has the central mounted gas heater,
so there's not a lot of room left under there.
Dave
