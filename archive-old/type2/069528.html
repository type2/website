Subject: valve adjustment proceedure

OK... so what's the reasoning for rotating the engine backward
(counterclockwise) instead of foreward (clockwise) when adjusting the valves?
Simply to make it easier (4,3,2,1), or is there some kind of REAL reason?

Form follows function. Why else would wheels be round?
