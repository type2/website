Keeping  $30 in your wallet in case of emergency makes more sense to  
me than  carrying a spare coil.



hey Guys  yes on one hand and No on the other.  I seem to always  have a 
bunch of spare parts laying around so carring a spare coil doesn't cost  me a 
thing, The best thing about having it is that you won't be stranded on the  side 
of the road ,wondering where to get another coil ,having to hitchike a ride  
,leaving the wife and kids in the bus while doing so and you won't have to deal  
with some dummy behind a counter at one of these cheap FLAPS that doesn't 
know  anything and ends up selling you the wrong coil.   I have a bag that  
contains a coil, fan belt, gen pulley, , valve cover gaskets, electric fuel  pump, 
fuel lines with clamps,and a   Dizzy already set and tested.  I  just transfer 
it to the bus that I will be using that weekend, just stick it in  the engine 
compartment along with my extra oil.  . seems to work for  me.  later  mark 
dearing
