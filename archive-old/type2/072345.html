Subject: Shock Bolt

Hey List,

A rattle in the passenger rear end of my 71 riviera revealed the 
lower shock bolt missing, and the shock just hanging there by the 
upper bolt.

Where would I find a replacement?  Size, gauge, length...A trip to 
the hardware store?

Do people use loctite or any other method to keep this from happening?

Please reply to me directly, I am on digest....

Thanks!

Wes Kennedy
Bamf, 71 Riv.
