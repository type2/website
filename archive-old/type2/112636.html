&gt;I've had the door buzzer relay removed since last July because it was

You can often push-start, w/manual transmission and a low battery.
I've discovered that the Bosch EFI needs at least 11V to maintain
an idle.  So once it gets push-started, don't loiter around.

&gt;It got me thinking that it would be handy to re-use the buzzer as a warning
&gt;for the lights.    ...

I have been thinking to include such a buzzer in the low oil
pressure 'dummy light' circuit.  When the light is shining, the
buzzer sounds.
