Subject: double relay?
Message-ID: &lt;44886175.252b91e3_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

   Once again i checked over all my connections. They are all tight, and 
clean. I do have the wires to the coil and am getting power through them. All 
my grounds are secure. I still dont have any power to my injetors. The double 
relay is what im told to troublesoot, but i'm not sure that i even know where 
to locate that. I've kinda figured it to be that little box screwed to the 
wall with two plastic harnesses plugged into it. One harness must be removed 
to remove the engine, and the other one (the one on the left), can stay in.  
So with the ignition on, i get power to the thicker red wire that goes in to 
the left side, but nothing where it comes out on the other side. I figure 
that this is whats needed to get the constant power to the injectors. (About 
10,000 miles ago when my starter died, i was push starting and heard a 
grinding/buzzing noise coming from this, but it has been fine since then.) 
  
  I removed the engine to replace my pistons about two weeks ago. It was 
running great at the time i pulled it even though there was a hole in the 
side of one of my pistons. I couldnt beleive it when i saw what had happened. 
I was only leaking a little oil, and wanted to clean it up in order to regain 
my addmitance to the driveway. To my surprise, i needed a new set of pistons. 
I drove on the bad ones from Arizona, to Florida, and up to Pa., where i am 
now. 
 Thanks Sean, and Paul, and everybody that has suggested any possibilities 
for your generous help.
