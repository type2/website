Subject: Engine trade offer in Ohio??

Happy Friday All!
Anyone interested in trading me a complete running
1500 or 1600 T1 engine for a complete running 1700
dual carbed T4 engine??  I have this 1700 it has good
compression on all 4 cylinders, starts right up and
idles nicely and sounds good.  However, it struggles
when under a load (bus in motion in higher gears)  I
suspect that it is carb or distributor related
(according to the numbers on the dizzy, it is
INCORRECT for this engine).  There is also an oil leak
that seems to coming from the area near the oil
dipstick tube, although I cannot tell exactly because
it is hidden by the engine hanger bar. I have no real
experience working on a T4 engine, all my experience
is with upright motors. I know fundamentally they are
not that different, but I like the upright motors! 
Anyway, I believe this would be a good engine if you
can troubleshoot this Carburetor\dizzy problem.  I
currently live near Akron Ohio and could travel up to
a couple of hours to do a swap. I will also include a
cool VW-inspired custom built chopper-stylr bicycle
for a good trade deal, see it here:

Let me know if anybody is interested!
PEACE! John Baker
