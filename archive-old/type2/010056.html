hey yah good idea,
-wooden horn cover
-wooden shift stick knob
-wooden keys for the wooden door locks
-wooden windsheild(great idea heh! there are so many +'s to having a wood 
windsheild; don't have to worry about chips, or spider web cracks,great for 
keeping the sun out of your eyes on a sunny day,you can paint it any color 
you want, but most important of all you get that outdoorsy look,yah know 
kinda ranger rick like.who ever there is one draw back to having a wooden 
windsheild, and it is if you where to get in an accident and you ended up 
going through the wooden windsheild you might get a whole lot of bad slivers 
in your face, yah thats the only draw back i can think of of having a wooden 
windsheild)

-and while your at it make some wooden tires( i recomend cedar, because it 
has a relativly soft texture and fibre but also excellent durability).

all this talk of making vehicles out of organic material makes me think 
about one the cheech and chong movies when they have a van made out of 
marijana.just a mental note and a little humor for all you out there who are 
too old to have any.(and for all the hard asses out there too)
good luck dude,
