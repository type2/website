okay, this is going to be a dumb question from a newbie. now that you are 
prepared :)
my brake pedal goes to the floor...no braking power. i asked the vw guru 
around this area what i should look at first...he said that it was either 
brake pads...shoes...or i think he said the master cylinder....how do i 
determine what exactly need to be replaced without going crazy...spending all 
my money and getting everything
i don't want to fix what isn't broken 
thanks in advance
peace
