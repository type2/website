I just got off the phone with AVP. I ordered my rebuilt engine.

I have the stock 1700 in my 72 now, and I have heard of the benefits of =
upgrading to the 2000 and wanted to, but I just couldn't afford it. I =
noticed the 1800 was only a little more so I figured I could at least do =
that.=20

Well the pistons, etc. are on nationwide backorder for the 1800, so they =
gave me a deal on the 2000. You only have to pay the $1100 initial price =
and they are waiving the core price, which is $400!! Also they are =
running a deal on the hydraulic lifters at $100 for the kit instead of =
the normal $150. So even with shipping all the way to me in NC I only =
pay $1320. Not bad for the 2000 and hydraulic lifters! If you were =
thinking of buying one now is the time!

I only have one question..she asked me if I was going to keep my =
mechanicl fuel pump (stock on the 72) or if I was going with the =
electric one which I guess came on the fuel injected models. I told her =
mechanical. Is that the best thing for this engine? I am going to use =
dual weber carbs.

Thanks for any input!
