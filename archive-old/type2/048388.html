 &quot;MIKE CASH&quot; &lt;vw1977_at_juno_dot_com&gt; shouts out thusly:

&gt; WHAT WOULD CAUSE A BUS TO COME OUT OF FOURTH GEAR? THE SHIFTER CAN BE
&gt; TIED BACK AND IT WILL STAY IN. THIS IS IN A 68.

Sorry to say, Mike, but the clock is ticking and you will need a rebuilt
transmission, or a good used one.
