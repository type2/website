Re-Greetings, List!

  Glad to be back in the folds! Some years ago I was on the orig. vanagon list
which has since, apparently, branched off into this more specific type2 group.
That's great!
  Ramona rests, and neither of us like that.
  Here's what's happening, and I am perplexed.
  New battery, new top-end rebuilt, relatively good starter, same-o on the
regulator. So here's the rub; I hop in and go to start 'er, both red lights
shine bright at the first turn of the key, she starts and sounds great, she
idles and warms and I cut her off (old tags for now; no drag around the
block). Then I wait maybe 10 seconds and try her again. Her reds do not even
come on some times, and if they do they go dim and I get nothing. Click,
click,click, NADA. Making me nuts.
  I need opinions on this. Starter? Short? (hope not; I'm no good at shorts.)
Solenoid? Fuses? Wha'?? Ideas on where to start??
  AND...I am about to invest some bread back into Ramona, and need to have
both her rear quarters replaced, as well as some reconstruction to her runners
(rotted out), and w/ the rear quarters, her battery tray, both right and left,
need replacing.
  I live in the Bay Area (CA), and am hoping some of you might be able to rec.
a good, reasonable body shop/ Veedub-Lover for hire. I am willing to do
much/most of the mechanical work myself, but need advice and professional help
with her sagging body. 'Mona craves the road again, as do I.
  Any help on both the starting problem and the body fixin' will be lovingly
appreciated by the both of us*
