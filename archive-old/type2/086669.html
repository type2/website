Subject: Re: [T2] 78' Westy Stool Wanted


The orange one you mention is this one of the vinyl covered earlier models?
Perhaps you can advise me of just what the right kind of money might be. I
am coming to the realization that this piece is tough to find.

I am also looking for the leg for my rear table, and the bracket that
screws into the bottom of the table to accept the leg. Go Westy wants
$59.00 for the leg and $24.95 for the bracket. Frankly thats rediculous. I
bought the table for $10. I suppose if it comes to it I'll get some tubing
and use my tubing bender and make the damn leg myself. They want $170.00
for the whole table w/leg. Hell I've bought whole cars for that much...

I don't mean to sound cheap. I have no problem paying top dollar for stuff
that is either high quality or rare as hen's teeth.

Hello Theodore  I have one of these stools that I'm using in my vanagon
right now. The right kind of money might get me to sell, have no plastic
trash can. I also have an Orange  camping stool that I will sell for $65.00
