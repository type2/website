Subject: Re: oh no! Parts Place on the list!!!!

&gt;Right now we have one full time
&gt;representaive and two part timers.  I often find myself running out of the
&gt;sales department to pick up the customer service line to help out...

and...

&gt;Our customer
&gt;service is understaffed and overworked, but this is still not an excuse
&gt;for them to be rude.

Of course not.  In fact, it's not an excuse for anything.  It's not the
customer's problem that your company (or Bus Boys) can't or won't hire
enough staff to keep the business running smoothly.

I've listened to a lot of &quot;companies&quot; whine and moan about being
understaffed and overworked, and I've worked for companies that are run
that way.  What I've learned is that these companies aren't that way by
accident.  Someone is trying to extract maximum profit at the expense of
customer service.  If that someone wants to run their business that way,
fine (this is supposed to be a free country) but don't expect me to shop
there.

I should point out that my criticism isn't necessarily directed at this
particular Parts Place rep - he may just work for the person who is really
to blame.

p.s. There's an old saying that goes, &quot;Excuses are like a**holes&quot;
(everybody has one).
