&gt; I believe the aux fan is wired in with the voltage regulator so that it
&gt; will not run unless the alternator is charging.  Therefore it should never
&gt; run with the engine off even if the key is on.  Someone please correct me
&gt; if I'm wrong.

David,
Depends on the year, as we found out :-)

'72 to around '77 was wired as you describe.  Somewhere around '77 they
changed it so that even if the engine is not running, if you turn the key on
and move the heater lever to max the aux. blower will start.
