Subject: Re: [T2] Tire shop apes broke my bus (long)

&gt; Sorry that happened to you. Although I have not had anyone brake the

BTDT, feel your pain

NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE drives my bus, anywhere, anytime, anyhow


and NO ONE touches my bus without me hovering over their shoulder.

&gt; Over the years I have learned to stay with the bus no matter how long
&gt; it takes and insist that they do not tourque the wheels down after
&gt; doing tire work. Every time I tell them to do it at 85 to 90 lbs they
&gt; want to argue about that not being safe. I have them roll it out to
&gt; the lot and I do it myself per spec and put the hub caps on myself.

yup I hand them my lug wrench and insist they put the lug nuts on with
that, I tell em, if they put them on with it I can get em off with it.

the place I have used recently insists that EVERY tire on every vehicle be
put on with a toque wrench, they wouldn't tighten my tires down until they
checked the spec in my (just so happens to be with me) Bentley

&gt; You are a much nicer person then I am. If I found my bus f'd up like
&gt; yours I would have caused a scene that shut the shop down as soon the

for sure,,,,...my next phone call might have been to my lawyer

&gt; AM started playing dumb and told me that I needed to find out who did
&gt; it. Good for you staying cooling a finding a solution to the problem.

yeah don't know how you do it...

Bob
