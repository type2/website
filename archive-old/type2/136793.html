You are, of course, 100% correct.  I also agree completely with your 
assessment of the legislature (and I extend it to the governor).

The point I was trying to make is that these are things I should do 
anyway, and once I do them I won't really have to worry about the new 
restrictions, because my Bus will run clean enough to pass them.
