&gt; Stephen White and I have had a e mail or two about the different ways
&gt; you could receive a Westfalia from 68 to at least 72, my year. Since
&gt; mine has no pop top I have always called it a weekender, it has the full
&gt; camper set up other wise. This is what Steven wrote:
&gt;
&gt;  I still think there were 3 basic westies available at that time
&gt; frame...
&gt;
&gt; 1) weekender - full width back seat no cabinet, no jumpseat
&gt; 2) hardtop - regular backseat with cabinet &amp; jumpseat
&gt; 3) poptop - same as 2 but with pop-up roof
&gt;
&gt; but i could be wrong... thogh i have seen all 3 in person and definitely
&gt;
&gt; they were stock and not modified.
&gt;
&gt; So.... could someone shed some light on the different ways you could
&gt; request a westie and what each version was refereed to?
&gt;
&gt; Thank ya so much.
