Subject: Re: [T2] fuel gauge sending unit


I am not sure about this problem, but a few weeks ago there was a post
about adjusting the guage. Someone mentioned doing something to the guage
to get it to read completely full when the tank was full. My guage never
goes quite to full when I fill up and when it reads empty it takes around
12 gallons to fill it up. Isnt the tank around 16 gallons total capacity?
Would the person who posted that guage fix earlier please refresh me.

Hey folks, on my 74 SC, the fuel gauge registers accurately when the tank
is full and down about 6-8 gallons...when it gets to between 1/2 and 3/4
full, the gauge very rapidly (like within 5-10 miles) falls down to
completely empty.  Does that sound like the gauge or a faulty sending
unit?  None of the manuals tell how to check for &quot;partial&quot; performance of
the gauge.  Thanks, greg
