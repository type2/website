G. Simmons sends:

&gt; Jeremy, this is a traditional way of shrinking metal.  It is not quite so
&gt; slapdash.  You heat a small spot in the center of the stretch until dull
&gt; red, then quench, then work in circles outward.  I'll confess I have not
&gt; mastered this, but good metal guys tell me this is the way to do it.

Strip the part down to bare metal before you try heat shrinking it. You're
going to screw up the paint anyway, but you'll miss the &quot;dull red&quot; stage you
need the metal at if you don't start with clean metal.

Quick tip for those of y'all trying to weld sheet metal with oxyacetylene:
skip the gas rod they sell at the welding store and get a roll of thin GMAW
wire. It takes more heat to melt 1/8&quot; rod than it does to melt a hole
through your Bus.
