&gt; Firstly, I ran the engine for about 5 minutes to let it warm up and
&gt; thin the oil out, and then removed the plug and went on to my other
&gt; project to give it plenty of time to drain.  I'd say it had 30 minutes
&gt; or so to drain.

That's a really really really long time...

&gt; Now, Bentley claims &quot;7.4 US pints&quot; for an engine with oil filter.  By
&gt; my calculation, that is just a tad over 3.5 quarts.

Right.
 
&gt; Muir, on the other hand, claims 3 quarts for an engine with oil filter.

Also right!

&gt; My observation is different than both.  I put about .5 quart into the
&gt; filter before installing it (no reason other than this is simply the
&gt; way my dad taught me to do it when I was a kid).  I then put 2 quarts
&gt; into the case via the filler neck.
&gt; 
&gt; So now I pull the dipstick, wipe it clean, dip it again, and it reads a
&gt; bit (like maybe 3/16''-1/4'') over the &quot;full&quot; mark.  &quot;Uh, what gives?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, I'll give the oil a little time to settle in the sump (which, of
&gt; course, should be totally unnecessary since you're filling directly
&gt; into the sump, right?), and head off for lunch.  Come back about 40
&gt; minutes later, check again, still over the &quot;full&quot; mark.

Sounds like you overfilled it. Everyone is so eager to get it to read
exactly at the full mark they usually blow it. I've done it too.

The amount of oil required depends on how much of the old oil is stuck to
the interior of the engine, in the passageways, etc.  A clean crankcase
required 4 qt. of oil, 3.5 qt. is the spec and having to add less at oil
change time is more typical.

Ever since discovering that I've only put in 3 qt., examined the stick and
decided to pour in more afterwards. The amount of oil the between the two
marks translates into 1/2 quart.

&gt; So, I'm a little confused.  Can someone help me out, here?  Itt can't
&gt; really be overfull, can it?  If it is, can I siphon the excess oil out
&gt; of the filler neck using a small hand pump?

If it's really overfull then you can remove the drain plug and quickly put
it back. The oil will stop flowing out even before you thread the plug so
you don't have to worry about it all coming out unless the oil is too hot.
You should wait until it's cool...
