Subject: Re: [T2] pinched oil filler vent tube

Just as Jason described, this is called a &quot;Road Draft Boot&quot;.  It covers the
bottom end of the tube and had a slit cut into the pointed bottom.  In
California, the CARB (Smog Guys) called it a PCV Valve.  When California was
requiring the annual smog test for Buses up to 71 and Bugs up to 74, it was
part of the visual check list - if it was missing, you didn't pass (even if
the sniff test was good).

VW Part # 311 115 541

It is not unusual to have a drop or two of oil from there, but not a
constant drip.  If excessive oil appears there, you may be a victim of
potential excessive blow-by.

&gt; &gt; I'm helping a friend track down an oil leak on a stock 1600 engine. As I
&gt; &gt; was lying underneath just having a look, I noticed that the oil filler
&gt; &gt; vent tube is pinched closed at the bottom. Not like any I've ever seen.

&gt; Are you sure it it actually part of the metal pipe? Stock engines are
&gt; &quot;supposed&quot; to have a little rubber end that is crimped so that extra
&gt; engine pressure is allowed to escape the case, but it should not suck in
&gt; any bad things from outside. This might be what it is.
