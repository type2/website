Subject: Re: [T2] Bus for sale

From: &quot;Mark L. Hineline&quot; &lt;hineline_at_ocotillofield_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Reason #1: Every bus owner has had the experience of having someone
&gt; come up to them in front of a gas station/convenience store on the
&gt; highway, or in a campground, all moony-eyed, saying either that they've
&gt; always wanted to have one of these (that is, your bus) or they had one
&gt; once upon a time.  You can be the moony-eyed guy or you can be the guy
&gt; with the bus. Which would you rather be.

Every other one (the last two, in fact) want to buy the bus on the spot.
Had one guy leave his card under the wiper.

Love the looks and comments from other drivers.
