Hi Volks,

thanks to everyone who inquired about the Golf/Rabbit/Vanagon Diesel 
engine conversion to the Loaf.  Due to the larger than expected 
interest I'm making this a general post (and also in the hope that 
bigkitty gets a digest cranked out before I leave from work... ;-)

I'll gather information over the weekend or so, and post detailed 
information early next week.  What I can say now is: that the 
conversion utilizes the rear end of a Vanagon Diesel transmission on 
the existing Loaf tranny; that cutting and welding are required, but 
not excessively; that the radiators are cooled by electric fans 
which too are located in the engine compartment; and that the 
conversion ought to be possible with gas (petrol) inline four VW 
engines as well, as far as I know.  At least I've seen a Vanagon 
Crewcab with an 1.8 litre Golf GTI engine done by him.  I *assume* 
that 5 cyl conversions should be possible too.

Detailed conversion how-tos are available from my friend, albeit 
not for free.  The price of one is another part of the information 
I'll post next week.  I'm not sure if Vanagon Diesel tranny parts are 
available in the US; I'll inquire about the price of used ones here 
in Germany anyway, in case we need to export them.

Thanks again, and have a nice weekend!

Yours,
    Erik.
