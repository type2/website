Subject: Re: [T2] front end problem

&gt;problem is when I went out Wed last to a place I use regularly to get the
&gt;front end aligned, (Hunter electronic, even had the spec's in the computer
&gt;for her)  They could not get the left front all the way to spec, very
&gt;close only off by 1' but that was as far as the eccentric would go.
&gt;I checked out all of the reused components and everthing was to spec...so
&gt;this has got me really scratching my head.

One degree negative is OK ( i like more ).
A rudimentary check can be achieved with a two-foot level,
vehicle on level ground, place level against rim and measure the
amount from the rim out to the level, 1/4 &quot; is about a degree of camber.
I doubt if you have the tools to check for a bent spindle.
