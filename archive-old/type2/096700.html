Another twist on that...Car guys/gals who give you VW parts from their old
Bus or Bug that have been sitting in the back of their garage for years with
a smile and the statement, &quot;This'll fit your's, right?&quot; Of course, since it's 
a
box of Bug wheel bolts, one sun visor, a broken horn ring, a Delco starter, 
and one muffler clamp size 2 1/2 inch you know it won't but take the box
anyway 'cause you know they mean well...;-)
