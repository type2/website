Subject: towing? (the newbie speaks... again)

First, thanks very much to all who emailed me with
advice on my first Westie purchase.  I have decided to
delay the purchase of the 73 bus I mentioned in my
inital post and check out the bus that was referenced
for sale in Dallas.  Should I be able to find time
totmorrow to do so (I am in the Air Force and am
currently at Sheppard AFB for tech school -- we are
locked down and restricted to our dorms during all
this terrorist mess), would it be safe to tow a bus
rear-wheels-down for 100 miles or so w/o disconnecting
the drive axles?  

Thanks again for all the kind advice -- I wish I could
mail all of you who replied personally, but my screwy
schedule at the moment forbids it.  Thanks very much
though, and thanks in advance for any advice you'll be
able to provide on this towing topic!

Chris Cougill
prospective Westie owner
