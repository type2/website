Subject: MofocoRama; clean 73 Westy auto FS

I attended the first MofocoRama at Mofoco in Milwaukee on Saturday. Even
though the weather was cool and overcast, it seemed like a decent turnout.
I saw only one other bus in the area, but they were leaving when we were
arriving.

The Mofoco folks had some of their stuff on sale. There was a tiny swap
area. Both of these areas could be improved for next year.

What I found most interesting were the vehicles for sale (I wanted to tour
their manufacturing plant, but by the time we got to that end of the
complex, the SO [i.e., starving other; wife] wanted to have lunch [we had
lunch at Miss Katie's Diner, where Pres. Clinton and Helmut Kohl had lunch
when they met in Milwaukee-a great, simple place with excellent food and
reasonable prices]).

A 73 Westy with automatic transmission was being offered by a guy from the
area. It has about 90k miles on it, only a little light surface rust on the
bottom of the pan, having been garaged in winter (it has WI collector
plates, which means it can't be driven in the months with snow on the
ground, which in Wisconsin mean several weeks in July and August :)).
Otherwise the bus was in almost perfect original shape. The bus has been
maintained very carefully. Everything was stock (except curtains), as it
came off the assembly line. The trans was rebuilt in 1989. I had never seen
a completely intact Westy before, so it was very interesting. He's looking
for $6800 firm for it. If there's interest, I can post the information from
his ad to the list.

Mofoco also had a collection of VWs for sale. There was a decent-looking 80
vanagon for $1595 (little rust, a few minor dents). They also had a really
trashed 73 Westy for $25 (poptop looked sound, though) (caption: &quot;This bus
has seen one too many Dead concerts&quot;). There was also a 66 Beetle with a
ton of spare parts in it. The engine needs to be installed (it's where the
back seats should be), the interior looked trashed, but the body has no
rust. The SO (i.e., sensible other; wife) at first said no way, but the
idea of a rescue mission is becoming more attractive to her (she wants a
Beetle).

We actually had a pretty good time at this, which was our first VW event.
We'd go again. I can only imagine how great it would be to attend the
gatherings many of you have written about.
