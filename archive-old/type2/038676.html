Subject: Drill guides instead of EZ Outs

Tony in N.J. wrote about drill guides to remove stubborn fasteners. I have two
versions of Portalign drill guides a plastic one and one cast from aluminum.
The plastic one is useless!! don't waste your money. The aluminum one works
very well.

I have also come up with a couple of &quot;tricks&quot; for Portaligns:
1) I have two springs on the guide rods to keep the base extended, this helps
to line   up where you want the hole by keeping the bit off the work.
2) If you can clamp the base to what your drilling it will be easier. Just be
careful not to distort the base or the drill won't slide.

Please Wear Safety Glasses!
