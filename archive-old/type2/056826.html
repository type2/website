Happy Friday Listees,

I'm fixin to use POR-15 on floor pans, etc.  The can says to put plastic wrap
between the can and lid or the lid won't come off a second time.  How bad a 
problem is this?

I know it's not the best, but I'm going to patch some rust with fiber glass,
and
paint anything I can reach with POR-15.  Anybody tried it?  Has anyone tried 
using it for rust under the front and read window seals?

I realize these are half a*s fixes, but cutting and welding at this time is
simply
not an option.  Would appreciate any advice/experience.
