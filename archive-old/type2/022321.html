=====================================&gt;
Did you take a moment to look at the nut that holds the wiper onto the 
drive shaft?
you know; that acorn nut just under the window on the outside of the bus.

Sometimes that acorn nut which has a smooth bottom on it, will come 
loose; especially if the person who might have worked on the wiper some 
time back did not use a star type lock washer under the nut.
