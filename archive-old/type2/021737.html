Subject: 80 Vanagon Camper - Raleigh NC - best offer

Hey all,

2nd post of this message

I was on this list from 95 till last fall.  In Nov. my computer died &amp; I
just replaced it w/ another.

I have a vanagon that I need to let go of.  Julia &amp; I are expecting in
Nov, &amp; so that she can be a stay at home mom, we're cutting loose some
stuff.

1980 VW Camper
Good body – usual stuff – dinged sliding door / dented bumper
Good seats / beds top &amp; bottom – no kitchennete (has been removed)
Great project / personalized camper
Needs work – Has a 73 engine in it &amp; a trans.  3 flat tires
Clean Title

Best offer by 8/25 – must take possession &amp; move by 8/25
(or pay extra storage fee _at_ storage facility where the van is located)

Story:
I have a 76 westy deluxe that I have done almost everything mechanical
to.  My wife &amp; I took it across country 10 years ago (Before I knew a
lot about the bus).

My brother in law &amp; I bought the 80 vanagon ~ 4 years ago.  It has been
sitting in his yard (1st 3 yrs) &amp; then in a storage yard for the past
year.  Kids/work/ &amp; house projects have gotten in the way.

When we got the van it had already been sitting for a year.  The
previous owner was the original owner.  They had driven it going to
Highland game events.  The original engine developed a problem (they
could not elaborate - I think they might have left an oil rag in the
engoine compartment &amp; it got into the fan) &amp; so their nephew put in a 73

engine (best I can tell from the # on the case).  I have succesfully
started it on a few occasions (3 yrs ago) but did not drive it.  The
engine will need to be replaced (or the tin/fan modified) because of the

location of the oil dipstick.  On the vanagons, the dipstick came out of

the top of the case.  On the 70's bus, the Type4 engine had the dipstick

exiting from near the bottom of the engine (on the oiler filler tube).

It will need a good deal of work - but nothing impossible, or too
expensive relative to the purchase price.  To move the van you will need
to have new tires put on the rims.   I recomend getting
the light truck tires.  I have yokahama's on my 76 &amp; like them a lot.)

reply w/ any questions, etc.

Are you planning on putting her back on the road?

thanks
michael


Price Range: Right now it is at a case of imports.  I wanted to recoup
the storage fees for the past 8 months (8*40=320) But more than that, I
want someone to get it who will put it on the road &amp; have some fun in
it.  I don't plan on doing an &quot;auction&quot; but it would be nice to recoup
some $.  Otherwise, the imports will be nice ;-)  I'll keep everyone up
on who's offered what.  It is located in SW Raleigh if you want to see
it.
