Dear Chad &amp; Jen, &amp; List -

I would guess you have DC going through the winding in the coil.
How this could happen, I don't know. One possibility is that
points are closed and the ignition was left on.  There could also
be a short somewhere. If the coil was grounding internally, I
doubt if it would run the engine.

Check for possible grounds on the primary side of the coil, from
both terminals to the case of the coil.

burning hot, the engine
&gt; was cooled down but not the coil.  What can be possble problems?
Could it be
&gt; grounding out somewhere?
