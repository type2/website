Subject: Cleaning/painting Fan Shroud
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I was watching the tread on cleaning parts by cooking them using TSP. I was 
wandering if there is a different method for us without a huge cooking pot. I 
am cleaning and painting tin to put engine back together. I would like to get 
the fan shroud as close to new looking as possible. Since that is the first 
thing you see in the engine compartment I would like it to look nice. It is 
very dingy and stained. Is it possible to use a wire wheel or something.

Is painting an option and if so what kind (would like to look orig)

This is a Type 4 2.l

Thanks
Waldo
