&gt; This time I calim for help my westy has a strange behaviour up hills, after a

&gt; very step or long hill the bus fail to dead. As soon I change the position
&gt; avery works well.

Without any information about what year, what type of engine, etc, etc I 
can only make a couple of suggestions/questions.

It could very well be fuel starvation, have you checked your fuel 
filters? An incline will usually cause the engine to use more energy to 
move it up the hill, at least as long as the laws of physics still are 
in effect ;)

Could the engine be overheating, causeing pinging and general loss of 
power? Do you smell any different odors from the engine being ultra hot?

It could be a clogged fuel tank outlet. give us a bit more info and what 
you have investigated.
