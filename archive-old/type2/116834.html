Subject: Re: [T2] '71 intermittent problem

&gt;My '71 intermittently sputters and dies (as if it were running out of gas) 
&gt;while freeway driving.&gt;

My Thing did the exact same thing and the culprit was a dirty fuel filter 
caused by a rusty gas tank, when's the last time you've changed that? Also 
your fuel pump may be going out, check to see if it's leaking.
