Subject: oil leak main seal can i drive far?



thanks for the help.
i think i will pull it repair the seal and a few other things this weekend 
and try to make it to Josh Rogers IV (soon to be called Oklahoma Bus Bash 
2002)Keystone State Park, OK
September 13-15



[...]Iwould pull it out and change the seal, it only
takes a couple hours and it'll be worth it

    &gt; so i want to go camping this weekend, my 71 (type1
&gt;eng.)bus has a leaking main seal. it seems to leak the most when i first 
&gt;turn it off. &gt; &gt;
&gt;
