Subject: Re: [T2] Propane Catalytic Heat - Drawback

Try &quot;heating&quot; your bus with it all closed up using the stove.

Will look like it has rained in there - everything is covered with a layer 
of condensation.

And no, don't use the stove with everything closed up.

See ya.

&gt; From what I understand, a byproduct of the combustion of propane is water 
&gt; vapor.  It seems to me that the water vapor I released inside my bus 
&gt; condensed on my tools (and who knows what else inside; inside doors, etc) 
&gt; as things cooled.  While the catalytic element makes the combustion safe 
&gt; for us to breathe, the water is still there.  Has anyone else seen 
&gt; condensation inside their bus from using one of these heaters?  I thought 
&gt; I'd bring it up since it seems to me I've noticed several list members 
&gt; using these heaters.
