&lt;&lt; There's an aspect of this thread that I am not tracking. Everything 
that's being said makes sense if you are driving your bus, and you're 
at fault (or if coverage for uninsured motorists kicks in). But what if 
you are not at fault. What do arrangements with one's own insurance 
company have to do with settlements from the other driver's insurer?

Mark &gt;&gt;

Possibly; because unless you have &quot;declared/agreed value&quot; with your
own insurance company, there's a chance that the other guy's insur-
ance will only pay you what &quot;they&quot; decide is the value of your Bus...
If the Bus is severely damaged, the insurance company will fight to
only pay you the value of the vehicle, not the total cost to repair it.
This makes sense in some cases, to prevent someone from buying
a clunker, disabling the stoplights and slamming on the brakes to
cause somebody else to rear end them...And collecting a check to
repair the clunker (and the inevitable pain and suffering from whip-
lash, of course...;-(
In a worst case scenario, if you have declared value policy on your
Bus, you might have to claim on your insurance to get your Bus re-
paired properly and fully...And let your insurance fight it out with
the other guy's to recover their costs...
Another thing to consider is the ownership of the Bus if it is con-
sidered a &quot;total&quot;...Who gets to keep the wreck? Some insurance
policies want the corpse so it doesn't turn up in another accident
and be the basis of a claim or have the title and VIN appear on a
stolen vehicle... ;-(
In England, every car has a log book that goes with the vehicle that
includes all the repairs etc. to the vehicle...Not a bad thing to have
on your Bus if you've spent big bucks rebuilding and restoring yours...
