Ok, This is Where I have to make a Comment.
Sesame Street is Good for the yuthful minds of todays society. No Violence,
sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll, or the Damned Bevis and Butthead Crap. I will
admit to watching it, and i enjoyed it. It teaches the fundimentals of
reding, writing, and arithmatic (something yur grandparents would say, i kn=
ow).
So, get off yur Cyber-Asses and ADD yur NAME to the LIST.
