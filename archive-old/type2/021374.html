Melissa, - I work with epoxy a lot, even to plastic- the secret is to
increase the surface area the glue gripsw, and like a dentist filling a
cavity, the epoxy must hold in a wsay as to not easily pull apart even
if the substrate won't actuallyt stick.
You can fix the gear if it's just the center- using a dremyl tool and a
fine bit (looksw like a tooth drill) , scratch up the gear center all
around the shaft, or score it with a sharpened nail.  I ground the
center of a washer down so it just fits tight over the shaft.  Score it
also.  I epoxied the center of the shaft to the gear and also to the
washer/shaft (washer was laid over it-and the washer acts as a means to
spread the stress the epoxy holds.  That motor is still in the 71 bus I
retired in 1985 due to rust out.
