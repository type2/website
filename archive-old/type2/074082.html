&gt; Joe said
&gt; &gt; Biggest PITA was that, with no space behind the ring eyes, you're _just_
&gt; barely gripping it and the ring tends to pop off at the exact moment it
&gt; looks like it will come
&gt; &gt; out.  Thus the screwdrivers.
&gt; Amen brother..... Just did that last weekend..  The correct tool will take
&gt; minutes of time of the installation and cut down the frustration factor.
But
&gt; if not definitely have a few small screwdrivers to help pry..

I took an old pair of needle nose pliers and filed the inside of the tips a
bit so there was a flat area to grab the snap ring.  Works like a charm.
