Blane.

I don't know whether the air-filter, air preheater significantly shortens 
the engine warm-up period, but it can contribute to improved fuel economy 
during cold weather and certainly helps to inhibit carburettor icing!

In Europe, the 1972-79 VW Type 2s, were also fitted with the sheet metal 
duct of which you speak. I have one spare for sale, but unless you are 
unable to obtain one lacally, it would probably be prohibitively expensive, 
to send it by parcel post, from Great Britain.

Regards.
