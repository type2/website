Subject: fs 68-79 side tent/camper stuff

Hello list. I have a near perfect side tent for sale. 68-79 westy acc. It is as nice of one as I have ever come across. It has all poles and tie downs,stakes. I do not have the original tent bag. It is a solid 9.5 out of a 10. I want 600.00 for it and I think it`s worth every penny. it is located in Delware. You pay shipping.I also have lots of other camper stuff. Too much to list.Complete interiorfrom a74 westy,Two stools,,jalosie windows.etc.. I can deliver to Everybus. Thanks, Dave Parsons
