Subject: RE: 78 Bay Max Tow Weight

VW supplied two different hitches (in Germany): one rated at 800 kg (no
trailer brakes) and 1200 kg (with trailer brakes) with a max tongue weight
of 50 kg. These hitches are mounted with three bolts - the two bumper
bracket bolts and a third one in line with the bumper ones.

A more heavy duty one is rated at 1500 kg (or 1800?) - but still 800 kg w/o
trailer brakes - with a max tongue weight of 75 kg. These hitches have an
additional &quot;ear&quot; that extends from the bottom mounting bracket to an
additional captive nut in the side of the frame.

Any manual trans late bay (including the 1600 DP) qualifies for the 1200 kg
capacity, higher capacity came with additional requirements. Not sure what
these were, but most likely type 4 engine and the heavy duty rear torsion
bars (used in panels and campers, optional equipment on buses). Automatic
trans buses are rated next to nothing - 800 kg with trailer brakes or so.
Most likely reason is the lack of a trans cooler.

All of these figures are based on a maximum speed of 80 km/h (50 mph) while
towing a trailer.

Now that is the theory. Based on my experience, anything up to 1800 kg is
fair game with a 2 L engine. We just came back from Everybus with a car in
tow: MGB on a tow dolly - total weight about about 1300 kg, no trailer
brakes and stopping distance was still fine. And this does not mean to
travel at low speeds - we cruised at 65-80 mph. The bus has enough power
(and mine has some extra) to handle more, but handling becomes suboptimal
(tendency to fish-tail) if you try to haul more - the bus is simply not
heavy enough to counter-balance more trailer weight.

I have used bays with a 1600 DP, stock 2L, and modified 2L for hauling.
Obviously, more power is always better, but stock is sufficient.
