Listees,

I wrote about the driver's side of my bus being caved-in yesterday.  I'm
concerned about being shafted by the insurance company.  No one has 
let me know how to contact Das Bulli or other suppliers.

The good advice I've received is to get appraisals before going to the company
appraiser.  I believe he's going to price it out to have the dents pulled and 
20 lbs of bondo applied.  That's not gonna get it.

Again, if anyone has any ideas about how to save my bus, _PLEASE_
send me some advice.  This whole situation sucks big time.
