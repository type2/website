 The reason they can't pull one off the shelf to tell you Richard, is that
their parts are next door in a Mega huge warehouse complex that services
more than just their business. It is a sign of the times, they are connected
to the warehouse via computer, then they place your order, and the drones in
the warehouse pull it and pack it. They also supply some type of
perfume/???? businesses, because quite often if you smell your orders from
CIP they have a &quot;scented&quot; smell to them!! I've been there and seen the
operation in Langley, BC, which BTW is the real site of CIP. I've never
visited the Blaine operation.

I've always received what I've expect in terms of quality and description

except once.

 

What I don't like about CIP is that if you call and ask who makes part X

they have no idea and rarely will pull one from the shelf to inform you.

 

I still think it's a good business.
