Subject: RE: [T2] Gathering group to help engine drop  (Troy's bus)

Ahh BTW the tranny seal can be a bear to get out. I fabricated a hook out
of a flat screwdriver to do mine. there must be a proper tool for this.
My problem was there is no working room between the shaft and the seal to
grab on to.



&gt; 	I have the seals already (From Busted Bus, thanks Joe!).  Here
&gt; is the list of parts that I already have.  I am going to do the both the
&gt; seals for the engine and tranny while  at the same time.  Any
&gt; suggestions to other items that I should have are welcome.  Thanks
