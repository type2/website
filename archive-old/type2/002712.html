Not to make your life more confusing, but if you have a mechanicaly sound
engine and a bad body, what are the chances of looking around (you're in
CA?)  for a &quot;rust free&quot; body with a blown engine, swapping engines and then
having one good and one parts bus?  As you will know from this list, having
a &quot;parts bus&quot;  is a long tradition....8^)


Good luck.
