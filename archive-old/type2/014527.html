Subject: Adapting engine rebuild stand for running in ?

Hi, Listers,

I've got one of those floor stands (Harbor Freight, et.al.) which has a 
rotating trunnion with 4 articulated arms to hold the engine. Each arm has a 
&quot;bushing&quot; on the end to take an engine mounting bolt.

I was unable to get the basic T4 engine to fit for rebuilding, so I did that 
work on the workbench.

I'm now ready to do the initial running in, and would like to do that out of 
the bus, thereby making the post-runin checkout easier. Has anyone used one 
of these stands with the bellhousing and starter? What mods or fixtures did 
you have to make to fit?

I've got a parts bus which will supply the oil and temp gages for the run-in 
panel. I expect that I can find a cheap tach at the FLAPS. Fuel will come 
from a gravity feed can (twin carb setup) and I've hooked up a lawnmower 
cable for the throttle actuator. Any other gadgets that would be useful?

Will the stock tin give sufficient cooling when the engine isn't sealed in 
the engine bay? I have fans that I could play on the engine, but I don't know 
where to aim them where they wouldn't negate the work the tin is supposed to 
be doing. Experienced suggestions are much appreciated.
