Hi Lee,

I was in your boat back in 2000. I found a clean shell in NH through  
the type2 list and towed it 700 miles home for a complete interior  
and driveline refit. I am still driving it today, though it is  
getting a little bubbly around the edges.

Installing an auto tranny into a manual bus would be a PITA; the  
linkage is completely different. I would look for an auto chassis to  
transplant into, or consider learning to shift a manual. The manual  
tranny gets better gas milage, anyway. Auto tranny buses aren't all  
that much more rare than standards, although produced in lower  
numbers they seem to have a better survival rate.

Bringing in a rust-free chassis is almost always cheaper than doing  
major rust repair.  WHERE ARE YOU LOCATED??? The supply of rust-free  
chassis varies widely by location.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; So, do I need to find a body that is made for the auto shifter or  
&gt; are all of the bodies built the same?  Will my shifter fit into the  
&gt; same place as the clutch?  If so, is it worth trying to find an  
&gt; auto body?  They seem pretty rare...
