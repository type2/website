Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Bus Front Face

Hello-

Let me clarify.  I *just* learned that the part I need is called a &quot;nose
panel&quot;.  And yes, I need the whole thing.

In terms of the year, I have a '69 Westie.  I realize that 68-71 is very
different from earlier models, but thought I'd mention my (potential)
desire for a retro-fit nose panel and see what reaction I'd get.

I do wonder if the outer dimensions and mounting style of earlier years is
the same and/or similar?  If so, I have a very capable body guy on tap who
could most likely &quot;make it work&quot;.  How's that for over-confidence and
stupidity?

-David

&gt;&gt; I have a project bus in need of a new front &quot;face&quot;.

&gt; I think I can make a
&gt; '66 through '71 piece work, but obviously want
&gt; something dent and rust free.&lt;&lt;

What do yiou mean by &quot;face&quot; do you mean the entire
front nose panel?  If so, 66 and 71 are very different
animals.  66 and 67 would be the same, however 68-71
would be VERY different. What year is your bus?

Peace, John Baker
