Subject: Simple(!) Horn Question

I'm trying to make my horn work.  I understand the basic concepts =
involved here, especially with regard to the horn button completing a =
ground circuit.  If I get under the bus beneath the steering box, I see =
the wire that completes the ground circuit when you push the button, but =
I can't seem to figure out where this wire is supposed to connect to.  =
There is a female spade terminal on the wire, where does it connect?
