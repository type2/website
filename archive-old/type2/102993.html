&gt; Aren't these symptoms due to the no longer made filler neck tube being
&gt; worn/cracked ?

The tube between the tank and the downtube is NLA but you can cut your own
replacement from 1' piece found at NAPA.

The filler neck where the gas cap goes is now available again as a
reproduction item for about $25. Try West Cost Metric and other online
vendors. Don't be fooled by the Audi logo: it's a reproduction item. If you
did find an original I would check the rubber to see if it had hardened and
become prone to tearing.
