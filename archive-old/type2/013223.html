&gt; I thought that maybe that connecting the (-) and (+) to the coil would give

&gt; turned on, there is power (~11V), even when the engine isn't running....so 
&gt; that knocks down my idea of connecting to the coil.

I really don't think this avenue of thought will get you where you want
to be. the only thing that happens only when the engine is running and
not any other times is the ignition system (i.e. spark/coil/dist). The
idea of a centrifugal switch comes to mind, but I see that only being a
real problem. (bus won't start because pump won't turn on, because
engine isn't running, because pump won't turn on). 

I would just use the signal from the coil as the control voltage. How
often will you have the ignition switch to the run position and not have
the engine running.
&gt; 
&gt; So, question to you.... If you have/are running an electrical fuel pump with 
&gt; a dual carb system, AND have it set up to shut off when the engine shuts off, 
&gt; how did you do it???? and what relay(s) did you use??
another point is that you are relying on previous pressure to make sure
there is fuel in the carb. what if there is none? no fuel &amp; since it
only runs when the engine runs, I see a problem here also. Go with the
coil.
