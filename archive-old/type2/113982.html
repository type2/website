&gt;I thought torque was related to bore size (Harley Davidson = large bore = large torque.  Same for farm tractors)

&gt;How come 2.0 has such a large increase in torque from a 1.8 with a small increase in bore??

The answer is that torque does not really depend upon bore or stroke.  Torque is more-or-less proportional to displacement and the 2.0 has more displacement.  Displacement is the highest-order factor in torque production.  The design of the intake tract is also very important.  Bore vs. stroke has a relatively minor impact on the amount of torque produced, although it is important in terms of where in the rpm range peak torque is produced.
