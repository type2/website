&gt;&gt;But VW did do it.  My bus originally had a cardboard tube that went from 
&gt;&gt;the preheat box (basically the air inlet ahead of the air filter) up along 
&gt;&gt;the side of the engine compartment and into the vent area.  This I assume 
&gt;&gt;to avoid ingesting the somewhat preheated air that surrounds a hot motor.  
&gt;&gt;Never seen one in person but I did see a picture of it in one of the 
&gt;&gt;manuals when I looked close. &lt;&lt;

Hey David, yeah I remember you mentioning this before.  Fresh air duct to 
your carb.  But what about to the fan inlet?  Can you seal the fan to a 
fresh air duct?  I seems like it would help a lot.  The only problem I see 
is that there's not 6 inches of space in front of an upright fan so you'd 
have to flatten the 6&quot; duct back there.  So my question remains: is this 
enough air?
