Subject: Re: [T2] Whining bearing

Hi Leon,

Does it make more or less noise when the clutch is in? Does the 
vibration/noise stop when you put a hand on the shifter?

I had a front shifter linkage bushing drop out on my bus, and it 
sounded pretty  nasty. If your wheels aren't sloppy you might want to 
look at the shifter. Another possible culprit could be the brakes.. you 
might have a pad or shoe dragging.

Happy trails,

&gt; I got a kombi which I drive on dirt roads in Kenya. Now the thing is I 
&gt; gotta a whine which I think is a wheel bearing on the front end. It 
&gt; gently vibrates through the floor as well. But I can't get which side 
&gt; it is. If I jack it up all the wheels (I checked the back as well just 
&gt; to be on the safe side) feel firm, no wobble at all top to bottem. So 
&gt; is there any way I can find which one it is without pulling them apart 
&gt; and looking to see if I have any ball bearings looking rough?
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions?
