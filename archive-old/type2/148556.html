Subject: Re: [T2] sockets: regular versus impact

&gt;I broke my 19mm socket trying to coax lug bolts off the wheels of a

&gt;I would like to buy just this individual socket. My favorite catalog 
&gt;has sections for regular sockets and other sections for impact 
&gt;sockets.
&gt;What is the difference?

The basic difference is that the finish on an impact socket won't chip like chrome will on a regular socket. Not a factor for a ratchet but it becomes one when you drive it with an air powered impact gun.
