Greetings Steve -

I put a 1976 tranny (4.57) in my 1969 Westy / 71 Dual Port 1915.

With 185/75*14 tires, the calculator says I'm running 3250rpm _at_ 60mph (.88
4th).

The higher ratio (4.57 vs. 5.375) in gears 1 thru 3 are a pleasure to use in
the city, and I think a stock 1600 should be able to pull the larger gap
between gears (1.26 3rd = 58mph _at_ 4500rpm). On the highway, the 1915 does
okay,
but I think a stocker will have some trouble.

Not to worry!! You can get some lower profile tires to effectively lower
your gearing, if you find the 1600 laboring too much where you drive (I live
in Tujunga, CA - a hilly, windy area).
Hope this helps -

Mike Visket



&gt; i have acquired a 78 transaxle but havent quite decided if the 1600 dp can
&gt; handle the extra tall gearing or not...

&gt; so, if anyone has any input i'd certainly appreciate it. (i think i've
&gt; decided to go ahead and try it and see what happens...)
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Steve
