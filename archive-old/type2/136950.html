Subject: &quot;Remanufactured by Bosch&quot; Alternator

My alternator is bad on my 74 Westy.  After pulling it, it has a
&quot;Remanufactured by Bosch&quot; sticker on the side.  I read here that any
alternator rebuilt by Bosch has a lifetime warranty.  I was wondering if
that is indeed true, and if it is, where and how do I get it replaced?

Any and all help is most appreciated.
