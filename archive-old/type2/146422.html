Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS Q?

I've never seen any, although I offered to do some back when AIRS was
first starting up.
On a side note, I do have plenty of the Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team
stickers left. The ACS&amp;RT predates AIRS by about 3 years, but is
completely informal...the people starting AIRS had a different vision, and
went ahead separately.
For info on the ACS&amp;RT stickers, check out the site:
http://teamspatula_dot_com/searchandrescue.html
&gt; I was looking all over the AIRS site, and was wondering if there is
&gt; any kind of decal that we can get that would show our bus as an AIRS
&gt; member?
&gt; If not, shall I make some and sell them?  They'd be pretty cheap, I'm
&gt; sure I can do them for less than $2 each.
