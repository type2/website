Subject: Dizzy/Ignition questions

I just ponied up the dough for a SVDA distributor from Aircooled_dot_net:
http://www.aircooled_dot_net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=IGD0001&amp;cartid=

I did this I'm tired of dealing with the 009/34PICT-3 combo on my upright 
engine now (bad idle, flat spots, etc.). I wanted to get the better advance 
characteristics of the mechanical and vacuum combination. Now I see that on 
the btlmex website they have an entire electronic ignition conversion kit 
for only a little bit more:

http://www.btlmex_dot_com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID=212

So my question is, did I buy the wrong thing? Anybody have experience with 
the electronic conversion kit? I wish I had seen this sooner, I'd have just 
spent the extra $20 or so for this instead of just the better points 
distributor. Does this have a good advance curve, or does that even apply to 
an electronic ignition? Since this is computer controlled will it just 
always find the best time to spark?

Thanks!
