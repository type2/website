Subject: Fall Equinox Festival - Brandywine Md- MANY BUSSES

 I thought I'd let you all know that this Friday the 20th through Sunday the
22nd a music festival will be at Wilmers Park in Brandywine Maryland.  A
few bands that I can think of off hand are Blue Miracle and Everything. I
usually attend two or three Wilmers Park funktions a year and the crowd
is very well behaved and the busses are pleantiful.  Usually a couple
Splits and also some Sportsmobiles.  If any members would like to attend
this and get together let me know.  Weather says sunny and 70's this
weekend.
