Could it possibly be that the alternator belt is loose and slipping?  This
would cause a lower voltage output. Or maybe its just time for a new
alternator?

Here is the old stand-by... check all your grounds.

&gt; Now if I could just run down why the alternator light comes on dim when
the
&gt; running lights are on, and gets a bit brighter when the headlights are
&gt; turned on (and a bit brighter still when flicking over to the high beams).
&gt; When the lights are on and I use the turn signals (the new t/s switch is
&gt; very nice), the light pulsates in time with the blinkers.
&gt;
&gt; But they do all work!
