My '71 Camper is missing the right wiper.  I noticed in RMM that they =
have different ones listed for mine and newer Bays.  What's the =
difference and can I get one of the other (cheaper) ones to work?  I'd =
like to stay stock, but it won't really matter by the time I get done =
with this baby!  :)

Have a good one,
Eric
