Subject: Follow-up: won't start...again. what else could it be?

Since most of my friends can't understand why I'm so excited, I had to post
a follow-up to people that can understand.....my bus lives!!!  I was sure
the battery was good, but I kept getting answers from the list that it might
be the battery.  With the help of an article in the library I was able to
determine that my battery was 4 years old, and likely not kept up well
during that time.  So I got myself a new battery (old was 500cca, new is
650cca), installed it, and my bus lives again!!  yippee!!!

I owe you a big thanks for your informative advice, helpful encouragement,
and general coolness.  You guys (and gals!) rock :)

'73 bus, &quot;Sundance&quot;
Portland, OR

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Problem:  1973 bus won't start.  the dash lights dim when key is turned to
start, but nothing else happens

Scenario when the problem started:  driving along enjoying myself, generator
light comes on, I make it home and turn off the bus.  tried to restart right
away and it gave me that slow turnover sound that you get when the battery
is dying.  tried again, even slower turnover sound. tried again, nothing.

History:  I had this same problem a couple months ago.  Took it to the shop
where they replaced the ignition switch after which it started up better
than ever.  When it was at the shop they tested the battery, starter, and
alternator....all tested good.
