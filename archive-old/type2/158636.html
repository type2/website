Subject: [T2] cranks but wont run

sorry everyone,
  where are my manners?  what would be the first thing that you guys would
check on a 78 FI bay if it would crank and then die directly after 2
seconds.  The Engine will turn over and crank but willnot run at idle.  it
will not even run at full throttle.  just for a second or two then dead.
what should i check first?
