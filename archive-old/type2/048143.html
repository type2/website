Subject: [T2] Euro vs. US delivery buses

More than three years ago I bought a copy of &quot;Origianl VW Bus.&quot; I have read
it countless times and often study the pictures for obscure details. I just
recently noticed that the 1978 Kombi that is so prominantly featured in the
1968 to 1979 section does not have engine compartment access hatch in the
rear luggage area that was added for the 1973 model year.

Since most European type2s were delivered with upright motors (1600 except
for the 1300 offered in Italy) was the extra hatch not offered on those
models? Was it possoble to special order a type2 for US delivery with a 1600
and if so did it have the hatch?
