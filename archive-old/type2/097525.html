Subject: Re: [T2] headlight chrome ring question

&gt;I have two different kinds of chrome headlight rings on my 78 and need to
know which is the correct one.

The passenger side is metal with a hella part number 11-941-175A
The drivers side is plastic with a KOA? part number of 211-941-177&lt;

I have a friend who has a 79 Deluxe and both of his rings are plastic with
the same part number as yours.
