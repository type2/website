List:

I have a '73 with a single Weber carb and a generic (AC Delco) electric fuel
pump that makes really loud banging noises when I sit in traffic for long
periods...as soon as I am moving again, it quiets down quickly. Any theories
or suggestions appreciated. Am also looking for sliding side windows used on
late 70's busses...am willing to pay to pack and ship, but local (New
Jersey) would be best.

Thanks,
Rod
