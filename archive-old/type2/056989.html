Subject: commuting in the bus?

How many of you out there commute any distance in your Bus?

I'm in something of a bind:  I still owe about $5000 on a car which now
needs $1700 worth of work.  As I don't have $1700 to spend, I had decided
to part with my dear old Bus and use the cash to get my car fixed.  (The
car is a '91 Honda Civic 4wd wagon.)

Last night I went up to Irondeqoit to show the Bus to somebody.  I haven't
been driving it recently due to some doubt about the validity of the
license plates and the lack of an inspection sticker, but I decided to risk
it since the plate tags are still current.  During the drive home, I
thought about it a lot and decided that I just can't bring myself to sell
the Bus.  I had wanted one since I was 4 years old (our neighbors had one),
bought it with my first paycheck from my first job after graduating from
college, and bought the Honda so that I could have a reliable car and
wouldn't have to put the bus through the abuse of a daily commute.  Now
here I was thinking about selling the Bus to get the stupid car fixed!?

As you may have guessed, I reconsidered during the drive home.  Since I
can't afford to pick up anything else right now, I'm going to keep making
payments on the car but take it off the road and transfer the plates and
the liability portion of my insurance to the bus.

Herein lies my question:  Am I foolish to commute in a Bus?  Can a vehicle
manufactured three months after I was born still take me back and forth to
work every day?

It's a '74 (carb) with some unknown number of miles on it.  (Could be
118,000.  Could be 218,000.  Could be 4,918,000. :) )It's in good shape
overall, runs pretty well, and has never left me stranded.  (Unlike the
&amp;#_at_$ Honda.)

I commute every day from Scottsville to Rochester (just under 15mi each
way.).  The commute is pretty easy - no real backups unless there's a train
coming through, and 45-60mph for all but the last mile or so.

I currently use about 1/2 quart of oil between (1500 mile) changes.  Once
or twice a week I get a little &quot;half backfire&quot; (more of a sputter) when the
engine is still warming up.  If I'm going to drive it in the winter, I will
need to come up with ductwork for the heater.  (The heater boxes are new,
but there's nothing connecting them to the front of the bus.)  The body
already has some rust, though I've become a firm believer in the ability of
&quot;Extend&quot; to stop the rust from progressing any further.  It had some major
body work before I bought it.  It's not pretty, but it's solid underneath.

Until now, I've only been putting about 2500 miles/year on the Bus.  As my
only car, it will probably get between 10,000 and 20,000, depending how
much I drive.

I have a good relationship with a trustworthy mechanic, so anything that's
beyond me can get taken care of as long as the price tag doesn't get over a
couple hundred bucks in any one month.  I'm assuming I can probably find
the heater components and put them in myself.

So, whaddya think?  Am I dumb to commute this far in my tRusty bus?
