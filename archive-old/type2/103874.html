Subject: Re: [T2] 1974 van dies when warm

Hey there-

I am new to Volkswagens, but this sounds like a problem that I had once with
a motorcycle that confounded both me, and a number of mechanics for months.
In the end, it turned out that the problem was varnish, and general
gumminess in the fuel tank that would slowly get sucked up into the tank
filter, and choke off the fuel supply. I would let it sit for a few minutes,
(the kak would fall back to the bottom of the tank), and it would start
again. We thought at the time that it had to do with the engine being warm,
but actually it was simply a question of time. The engine would only run for
about 10-15 minutes before the fuel supply was finally cut off by the
sludge. This would also explain why your carbs are dry when it quits, but
the carbs and fuel pump work fine at first.

I also have a '74, and would be very interested to hear from some of our
resident experts on how best to access the fuel tank, as my fuel gauge
sender is on strike, and I would live to give my tank, and it's prefilter (I
assume there is one) a good cleaning.

Cheers,
Matthew

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; We have a 1974 van, with dual Solex carburators, that dies when it gets
warm and won't start again until the engine cools down.  This happens when
idling or after driving for a while, stopping for 5 minutes and then trying
to start out again. We recently replaced,
&gt; spark plugs, rotor, cap, wires, points, adjusted the valves, timing and
rebuilt the carburators.  So, now it starts off and runs nice until it is
warm and then it starts losing RPM's and finally quits.
&gt;
&gt; After it dies, if I look down the throat of the carburator and pull on the
throttle, no gas shoots into the carburator.
