Subject: pedestal mats don't fit!

 Hello List,
   Just got a pair of seat pedestal mats for my 76' Westy from WCM and
noticed that the passenger side mat that wraps around the back of the
pedestal does not fit properly.  Anyone else have this problem?  It
seems to be several inches short at the top so I am thinking about
sending them back, unless this is the best replacement I can get.  Is
there is anyone out there that knows where I can get the right size or a
good way to make due with what they have sent me?
Thanks,
Phillip Freund
76' Westy
