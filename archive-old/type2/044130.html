&gt;well, since i didn't get any responses to my last post, i'll try again.,
&gt;i am getting a squeak from my front right wheel when
&gt;coasting, or driving in 1st or 2nd gear.
&gt;i'm guessing it's a wheel bearing, but i could use  2nd opinion. it
&gt;seems to stop when i hit the brake. it also takes a bit of driving to
&gt;get it to happen.
That year is indeed prone to wheel bearing noises, but it's usually more
like a grinding noise, often starting when you turn the wheels at low
speeds (ie parking).  A squeak is more likely to be brakes.  Does it go
away when you brake?  Dust on the pads will make a squeek.
