Subject: Re: [T2] The leaks never end,

&gt; So my question to you all is this, what do you think could be leaking
&gt; in there that would cause oil to get sprayed around the fan and out the
&gt; flaps ? Checking the oil I don't seem to have lost a tone of oil but
&gt; there is certainly a fair bit in there and its getting sprayed all
&gt; over.
&gt; Thoughts ? Tips ? What would your first check be ?

I'm going to assume you have a 1700, 1800, or 2000 engine. If this is the 
case you may have a leaking rear main seal. Not too hard to replace. Remove 
the three bolts that hold the fan on the crankshaft hub and the fan comes 
right off. If the seal is leaking you will probly see a nice spray pattern 
on the back of the fan. to remove the hub, remove the bolt in the center of 
the hub. I usualy hold the head of a wrench or some other suitable steel 
behind the bolt holes of the fan hub. Insert the three bolts in the bolt 
holes of the hub. Tighten them by hand until they contact the wrench and 
push the wrench against the block. then tighten each nut a little at a time. 
Maybe 1/8 turn each until the hub comes loose. I don't recommend using a 
puller that has a bolt in the center to tighten. The bolt often works its 
way into the bolt hole in the center of the crank and dammages the threads. 
NOT GOOD!

If you have to replace the seal don't forget too order the O-ring that goes 
behind the hub.

Hope this helps
Tom

P.S.
next time tell us what year or at least the size of engine. You will probly 
get more responces.
