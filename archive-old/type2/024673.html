Thanks to all who replied - tapping on the double relay does make the fuel
pump turn off and stay off when there's no key in the car, which is nice.
So...  can I fix a double relay or do I need to get a new one?  Also, the
fuel pump (due to running for days on end, I suspect) is now making funny
wheezing noises like the bushings/bearings are shot.  Can a fuel pump be
rebuilt?  If so where do I get the parts?  A new one seems very expensive.

TIA,
Niall
