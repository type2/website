&gt; &gt; Somebody was asking for one of these recently. I found two over the

&gt; &gt; behind. I fish 'em out with my fingernail. And I'm always looking for
&gt; &gt; more.
&gt;
&gt; I wonder if these springs are specific to certain timing curves?  I
&gt; would't be surprised if this were true seeing how there are different
&gt; curves specified in the bentley manual.

Mike,

I *believe* that this spring is the same for all T4 aplications, at least,
if not for all VW applications. It sits between the drive gear and the
distributor drive dog. It presses the drive gear down and the dog up.  
Its function is to keep the drive gear engaged in the cam shaft and the
drive dog and shaft up in the distributor case.  The only way it would
affect timing is if it were missing, in which case the drive gear could
ride up on the cam as you accelerated, changing the dwell and absolute
timing.  It would not affect the curve (or relative timing) at all, so I
doubt there are different springs for different dists.
