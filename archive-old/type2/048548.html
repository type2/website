&gt;I wanted to ask you how in the world you're getting 23 mpg out of 
&gt;Casper? The most I can muster out of our 76 Westy, Kermit, is about 18 
&gt;mpg. Kermit's running a 2 L. fuel injected ATK remanufacture that has 
&gt;about 1200 miles on it. Any advice you care to throw my way would be 
&gt;really appreciated.

&gt;Also, if you ever make it up to Colorado, look us up. We're on the

&gt;Thanks for the great entertainment and info on your site.

Hi George,
Well, getting the good MPG has been a real effort of love, work, and 
re-work on this end.
The engines I have are stock 1600 SP and they both have vacuum advance 
distributors with Hall sensors installed as opposed to points.
I certainly do not want to run the engines too lean in our Texas heat, 
and I don't want to blow the pistons apart with way early ignition timing.

As for the timing settings, which seems to have been a very real 
ingredient to getting the best MPG performance, I am afraid I have to 
be a bit nebulous as to exactly what the spark advances are under full 
RPM engine load(s).

HOWEVER.................
I just bought a &quot;tune-up&quot; set so as to allow me to accurately record 
RPM, dwell, advances, etc.
I will hook this whizbang tune-up set to both buses over the 
Thanksgiving weekend to accurately record exactly what is happening as 
far as timing vs, the function of engine RPM.

I plan to post to the list after gathering all this info.

Right now
I have managed to determine, from road experience trial and error, that 
Casper runs best when &quot;static&quot; timed _at_ 7.5 degrees BTDC for a realized 
performance of 23 MPG, very easy starting, and good power/acceleration.

I have also come to determine that NewBus &quot;appears&quot; to be happy when 
timed to zero degrees TDC (original OEM spec) using a static light.
NewBus gives 24 MPG, starts somewhat harder than Casper, and has a bit 
less power at takeoff.
This might be expected, given the lessened early on advance setting.

Now then, what is the individual bus firing advance under full RPM load?
That is what I want to know for both buses, and will post this answer 
later.
That is, after all, a very main ingredient to getting best performance.

I suspect that the buses have fairly close values of running advance, 
and the static value, as read, does not have a linear correlation with 
what is actually going on under full RPM running load for the two buses.
