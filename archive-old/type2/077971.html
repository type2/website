Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus....HELP!

Here are my observations from my small-time (5 75 watt panel) solar system:

First, the best and cheapest batteries are reconditioned 6v golf cart
batteries.  Look for used battery places.  These will take repeated
drainings to 20% of their charge without early retirement.  I have 8, which
I bought for $30 a piece at a used battery store.  The internals are all
new, so they work great.  You can probably live with two, wired in series,
for 12v.

Second, there's lots of 12v appliances, including portable tv/vcrs that run
on either 12 or 120.  Also 12v electric blankets, blenders, refrigerators,
etc.  Remember that the more juice you draw the faster those batteries will
go down.  The more batteries, the longer you can go.  Look into hooking the
batteries into the bus' charging system.

Third, solar panels are pretty expensive.  My 75 watt panels cost about $300
each, and they charge at just under 5 amps, during the 4 or 5 brightest
hours of the day.  You'll also need a charge controller if you set up a
solar system.  These run between$50 and $300, depending on how many amps it
handles.

I really like my solar stuff, but it takes a lot of tinkering, is rather
expensive, and doesn't generate practical amounts of electricity without a
pretty good investment.

Why not find somewhere with an electric hookup and use an electric oil
radiator heater?  Watch TV until it gets cool and then turn the heater back
on.

Regards,

Grant
