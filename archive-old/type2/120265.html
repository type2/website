Subject: Re: [T2] brake line fittings anti-sieze

I use regular anti-sieze on these steel line fittings, being _very_
careful to keep the stuff on the threads only.

The brake lines are sealed by the crimp in the line itself, so the brake
fluid never touches the threads.  I will be very happy if I ever have to
take those things apart again.

George
