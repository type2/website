Subject: Comparing 1600SP to 1600DP

In response to conversations about a notable power difference between the 
1600SP's &amp; DP's, I agree!

My '69 is much sluggish.  When I'm driving the '71, it's like a sports car.  
Better braking, too, with the slave cylinder (power brakes) and front discs.

I wonder if the '71's came with a tranny geared &quot;taller&quot;.  Could that 
account for a more robust power band?

Overall, I enjoy driving both.  I get slightly better gas mileage in the '69 
- about 17/22 compared with 15/20.  Both engines use a .009.
