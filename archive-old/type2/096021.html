Subject: Springs camping in North FL, USA

Folks, I've reserved a campsite at O'Leno State Park for Fri-Sun, July 12-14, for a weekend of hanging out on the Santa Fe / Ichetucknee and
various nearby springs.  This &quot;event&quot; is meant to follow in the tradition of the irregular Love Bug campout some of you have participated in before.

There's no real plan, just a two-nighter in the vicinity of some excellent springs.  If you're a canoe/kayak/tubing/snorkeling/scuba person, you'll find 
plenty to do.  If you're a sit around-and-do-nothing afficionado, you won't be bored either.

Florida's state parks now allow you to reserve specific campsites either online or by telephone.  My site is #18 in the Magnolia Camping Area in the 
park (there are two loops - this is the one closer to the river).  It's about $20/night for one with electricity -- handy if you want to bring a fan or two.  My 
experience is that while this is peak muggy/buggy season here, spending plenty of time in the cold springwater and having a fan in your tent makes it 
pretty tolerable.

There are two ways to make your reservation:

1. Call 1-800 326-3521.

2. If you're even a little web-savvy, go to http://www_dot_dep.state.fl_dot_us/parks/district2/oleno/index.asp and  click the &quot;ReserveAmerica&quot; link, which
takes you to a website where you can browse available sites and make your reservation online (you have to  create a free user account there first, it's
simple).

Hope you can make it!  If you would, drop me a line if you decide to join us so I can get a rough idea of who to expect.
