I've seen Fabreez advertized, it supposed to remove odors.
Personally I think I'd take the seats out and scrub them down real good
with soap and water, mabey carpet shampoo.
I'd let them dry in the sun for a few days, if you currently are having
sunny days.
I recovered a pair of really nasty front seats and I sprayed them down
with Ez-off oven cleaner to remove the caked on human sweat and oils. It
took two applications and a fair amount of brushing but they came out
real nice.
