    In my continuing saga to simplify my life and garage, I've got an 8 track 
player for sale. This was represented as working when it came to me in a 
parts deal. Its an Audiovox w/am-fm, even got the wiring diagram still on it. 
I have not tried it, but I only want $35 bucks or interesting trades. I'm in 
SoCal
