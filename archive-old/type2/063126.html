Subject: Ideas on a noisy diff?

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I sent this last week about the same time the link died for a few days,
&gt;so I didn't get any digests for a while and I dont know if it actually
&gt;made it to the list. So apologies if this is a duplicate: 
&gt;
&gt;Ive recently had the transmission re-done on my '65 kombi by a
&gt;reputable shop here in Sydney. It now works like a dream, no more
&gt;popping out of gear, crunching of gears etc.etc. BUT - it's come back
&gt;from the shop quite noisy.
&gt;
&gt;It always had a whine at the end of 3rd and all of 4th, but it's worse
&gt;now. I'm pretty sure it's the crown/pinion which they didn't replace.
&gt;When I asked the guy he said that he noticed they weren't in the right
&gt;position before so he &quot;fixed it&quot; - whatever that means. The other thing
&gt;is that it now leaks transmission oil from the side plates of the diff
&gt;ONLY UNDER LOAD. Don't know what to make of that, probably warped side
&gt;plates.
&gt;
&gt;Not having played with transmissions much, is it possible to replace
&gt;the crown/pinion without having to remove the tranny - like just take
&gt;the wheel/axles/side plates off? (at the same time replacing the warped
&gt;side plates). Has anyone come across warped side plates before that
&gt;would cause the leaking under load?
&gt;
&gt;Or, should I just turn the radio up more?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Steve Junor
