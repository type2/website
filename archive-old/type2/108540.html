&gt; Not the plastic jobbies mind you but the big steel ones.  Heavy 30 gal
tanks...

{thinks a minute...}

30-gallons?  That's roughly twice the size of the fuel tank in my bus... I'd
have a heart attack walking from the pump to the street...

{grin}

You probably mean 5-gallons.  I've had one for years and it's tougher built
than some of the civilian versions available.  Just be sure to get the
screw-on spout.  When we finally have a trailer for G I'm thinking of
mounting the can on the front of the trailer instead of on the bus.

It's probably not a good idea, but I removed the screen in the end of the
spout to get the gas to flow faster.  Just keep the can very clean.
