Barry,
I can't help as much as I'd like to, as I'm stuck at home waiting for my
surgeon to schedule a long overdue back surgery. But, out in my barn I have
two dual carb motors, an EA (1.7L), and a CB(1.8L). I picked these units up
as &quot;extras&quot; wheeling &amp; dealing in  VWs over the years. They are both pretty
much complete, but I never heared either run &amp; have no idea why they were
pulled in the first place. If a way could be found to get  the parts to
David, I'll give him  anything he needs to get his bus running. I am
located in Lynchburg Va. 
                                                                           
                               Ron Komoroski
                                                                           
                               '73 Westy w/penthouse poptop (The Pumpkin)
