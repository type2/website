Subject: Call me a wimp, but I want my air conditioning to work!

Hey fellow listees!  Before I start my tale of Bus woe, let me say that
Everybus was just the best; the weather and the people couldn't have
been nicer, and I even got a bunch of cool artwork done on my bus for
free by Danielle and Abi, thanks so much!  Ok, here is the problem.  My
78 bus has the original factory a/c, which worked fine last summer until
the belt broke.  I have the bus in the shop right now getting some
engine seals replaced and I had asked them to please put on a new belt. 
The owner of the shop calls me yesterday and tells me that in order to
put a new belt on he basically has to rip the whole engine apart and it
will take something like 30 hours of labor and cost LOTS of money and
that he is not doing it.  My question is: is replacing this belt really
that hard?  This guy is not my regular mech but he, like my regular
mech, is a VW specialist and I know so little about the workings of my
bus that I need some advice.  I am just about the sweatiest person I
know and I really need a/c, especially with my two little kids driving
me crazy all summer.  Of course, my love for my bus outweighs my need
for coolness so I plan to keep driving it no matter what the outcome,
but if anyone can give me a hand I would appreciate it.  Thanks!  Beth
in NJ and Prudence he 78 bus.
