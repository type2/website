Subject: RE: [T2] Transmission Mail Order?

I've heard great stuff about Rancho Performance, and have also used
Transaxle Performance with great results.
freeway flyers have either r and P changes 4th gear changes.
Splits often go for a 3.88 R and P for more top speed, but on a heavy
camper, especially a stock motor, you drive each gear further, and often
find 3rd for every hill.. Choose your gearing carefully based on the bus and
engine combo, and where you live.

Hello Listees,

It's been another bad news day :-(

The tranny is officially shot in my '74 Bus.

Wondering if you guys could reccomend a  good mail order tranny or should I
go
for the local rebuild at $695?

Also, what is the opinion on Freeway Flyer vs. Stock?

Thanks,

Tom
