&gt; True, now that they are 27 years old+. However, I'm sure back in 1975
the drums on my '75 Westy came off pretty easily. Actually my statement
was based on what I was told by a tire shop years ago. American made cars
(at least Chevys, anyway) have a flat speed nut on the rear drums, and if
you put custom wheels on you must remove it otherwise the custom wheel
will be out of balance-I know this from experience. The tire shop told me
the only purpose for these speed nuts was to keep the drom from falling
&gt;off when changing a tire. VW just did it a little differently.    Jeff

Aaah, grasshoppah, now or later you learn folly of listening
too much to tire shop sages...

Think about it.  When changing tires the drums are always vertical and
supported by the studs and brake shoes.  The only way they are coming off
is if they are pulled off (probably with a considerable tug).  I have
never heard of a brake drum falling off of a car in this situation.

However, when the wheel hub assembly (or entire rear axle assembly, in the
case of a Chevy) is being handled in the factory it is quite likely that
the drum will be pointed straight down, wherein gravity will definitely
remove it, which might damage something, at the least a worker's toes.
