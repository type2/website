&gt;Well I called Boston Bob and he is very helpful. Being a master of these
&gt;engines he explained that my single weber carb is killing my engine.

Well, that's his opinion.  Mine is that just about any carb/carbs will 
shorten the life of an engine when compared to FI, some more than 
others.  If the single Weber isn't driven in temps below 50 degrees f, I 
don't see it being much worse than any other carb, but icing will kill you 
(I mean your engine) with the single Weber, as has been discussed on the 
list before.


&gt;One thing I have had 2 people tell me is that I should look for some Delorto
&gt;dual carbs. Does anyone have these?

Yes.  They are nice carbs and if parts were readily available, I would 
recommend them.  BUT, parts are extremely scarce and there are just not 
many of them out there so all else being equal I would go with the Webers 
so you will have a larger support base (parts, tuning advice) to draw 
from.  You WILL have to tune them!   John _at_aircooled_dot_net has some very 
informative tech articles describing carbs and tuning issues on his web site.

&gt;I would have to go with the dual weber
&gt;carbs otherwise. There is also fuel injection. Can I put fuel injection on a
&gt;73? (boy I bet that is gonna bring a lot of emails)

Sure.  Jack Stafford did it and I know a few others have also.  My '73 will 
have fuel injection eventually.  You need to have ALL of the parts though, 
including different gas tank, fuel pump, wiring harness, distributor, 
etc..  You will also have to do some custom work when installing parts that 
weren't there before, such as the brain, airbox, and misc. bits that attach 
to the firewall.
