Subject: need help with voltage regulator!! (red light on)
Message-Id: &lt;4.2.0.58.19991021083513.00c06680_at_jittlov.qualcomm_dot_com&gt;

I did the dumbest thing in the world last week. I connected my battery 
backwards in my 77 westy.  After that the alternator light would stay on 
even when the ignition was off and the key was out:(  I was told I at least 
fried my alternator and maybe even my regulator.  I just got finished 
replacing the alternator with a remanufactured Bosh one and the light is 
still on.  Now I am trying to replace my external regulator for my 55 amp 
alternator and I can't find one.  Can some body please give me the part 
number of the external regulator that is mounted on the fire wall.  Also, 
why do the parts guys keep saying &quot;are you sure you don't have an internal 
regulator&quot;

Thanks for any help,
harry
