Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] RE: [VB]fuel sys mod

I haven't scoped out under a late bay tank, but what I have seen it that the 
tank has a threaded protrusion at the outlet.   a fuel sock goes in there, 
then a spout, a gasket, secured with a aluminium threaded nut type thing with a 
hole for the out spout to stick through.   this is shown in my bay bus parts 
list, which I think was updated through April 72 (has pancake stuff, but no FI 
stuff).  Perhaps yours has dirt on it?

To put on a fuel tap like the 61 &amp; earliers it has a special nut that has 
threads opposite directions.. so on end threads to the tank, the other to the tap 
when you turn the nut.    

I believe the threads are the same on the split and bay tanks.

&gt;Okay. Noticed last night my late baywindow doesn't have a threaded 
&gt;tap. Just welded (?) to the bottom of the tank. Short rubber hose to 
&gt;the valve?
&gt;Ciao!

hmmmmmm - mine had a small fitting which the nipple was ATTACHED to. 
actually, passed through, but the point is that there was a piece you 
could screw off, replace that nipple with the BD fuel tap.  possible 
that vw went to something else later; karl, you da king, did they 
change this?
