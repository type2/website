&quot;Original VW Multigrade 15W-40 Motor Oil. It is especially made for
Volkswagen engines and passes the high quality norms established by
Volkswagen. It is the only oil that is authorized for use in your
Volkswagen in order not to lose your warranty. It is designed to protect
your engine for up to 15,000 Kms. or one year on new vehicles.&quot;

 I pointed this out a few months ago when we were at this.
