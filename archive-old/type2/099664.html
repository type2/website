Subject: Re: [T2]  help!

&gt; &gt;He can't find a place to store it and may have to sell it. It's a
&gt; &gt;great bus but he has some time constraints to deal with here. He's
&gt; &gt;coming out to Denver Friday for 3 weeks so has to find a place to
&gt; &gt;store the bus tomorrow (Thursday). The tags and insurance have
&gt; &gt;expired so he'll have to have it towed somewhere I guess.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry if this sounds harsh, but isn't the obvious thing to get the insurance
&gt;and tags current and put some air in the tires?  There are some
&gt;responsibilities associated in owning any vehicle and these are pretty basic
&gt;ones.

Then just park it on campus. Check with Campus Police to make sure that a 
current tagged vehicle is okay there during the holidays. I know our school 
doesn't mind.

Alternatives include renting a space outside of a storage unit place 
(inside the fence) or inside a storage unit.

Back in 1995 in the Norfolk, VA area right across from the Little Creek 
Amphib base I rented a place to keep my partially complete '65 Beetle for 
$65 a month. MUCH cheaper than the impound lot...
