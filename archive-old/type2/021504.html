Unfortunately, think the only way to test it is on a bench with some
kind of metered airflow.  I've tried to find specs but nobody has them,
or is willing to share them..

I messed with mine ALOT but I could never really get it right.. I
finally swapped out a working one..

later,
Mike

&gt; I was wondering if there is a way to determine if an AFM is adjusted
&gt; properly - ie is the big coil spring set correctly?  Is there a
&gt; specification for how much torque it should take to open the flap all the
&gt; way or some such thing?  I suspect that the spring on one that I have is too
&gt; tight.  I'm wondering because I have an almost brand new rebuilt AFM that
&gt; runs my engine very lean (great for smog tests), but can't be adjusted to my
&gt; or my mechanic's comfort level (with gas analyzer) using the idle adjust
&gt; screw.  I'm using another AFM right now and trying to get this 'bad' AFM in
&gt; working order to use as a spare on an upcoming xcountry trip.  Any
&gt; suggestions?

&gt; 
&gt; P.S.  My wife used to complain that the bus was difficult to drive in the
&gt; wind - I thought she was just whining until I replaced the steering box and
&gt; steering damper - Thanks Bus Depot for selling me the parts to make my bus a
&gt; pleasure to drive on the highway, and my wife happy.
&gt; P.P.S.  If you see oil and crud on your steering box - check to see if it
&gt; still has oil inside it.  The one I took out was covered in greasy sludge
&gt; and dry as a bone inside.  I wonder why my steering was so tough.
&gt; P.P.P.S  Sorry if I am babbling - excited about upcoming trip.
