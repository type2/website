&gt; 
&gt; Where you live: State, city, and a nearest big city (to help me locate
&gt; you on a map!)

New York State, City of Brooklyn, the 'hood being Bed-Stuy. The nearest
big city? Well, I know there's a town across the Brooklyn Bridge, but
I'm not sure it has a name ;)

&gt; What is you van: year, model

'71 Westy. Primer red. Rust spots. Mangled front bumper. Can't miss it. 

&gt; What is your name:

Anton Elmquist

&gt; What is the name of your van:

Millie.

&gt; What is the URL for your home page: (if you have some)

http://www.spacelab_dot_net/~anton    

I just put up some pics of the Westy and my crumpled '64 Beetle...

&gt; &gt; Do you think I can answer how old are you?? Or it's not appropriate?? :-O
&gt; Tell me!

I am... I always forget this one. I was born in '68, so that makes me...
28? Right. I'm 28 years old.
 
&gt; And give me your suggestion!!

It'd be great to have a map up on the Web with little thumbtacks for all
of us that you could press to get to our homepages! Tacky, yes. But
funny ?!
