Hi, 

&gt; Anybody try one of these things on a STOCK vacuum
&gt; advance dizzy?

 Yup. Using one now. Been in for nearly a year (15,000 miles) with
a Tiger 581 for the last 9 months (12,000).
 It's great: no more futzing with points every few weeks! The only
thing I noticed was that since I never have to take the dizzy cap
off I forgot to lube the advance plate, so had some hesitation recently
in stop-go traffic: a squirt of DWF fixed that.

 I _think_ there are two versions of the Pertronix with slightly 
different mountings for stock &amp; 009 dizzys. Mine fitted right in
with no problem.

 Hoover says you don't need the Pertronix if you get the Tiger (the
CDI stops the points burning), and it also gives you a fatter spark.
 You might want to consider getting the Tiger first. I only got the
Pertronix because it was available in the UK and I was fed up with 
the points. The Tiger came later when I decided I couldn't find a UK
source for a cheap CDI.

Cheers,
	W.
