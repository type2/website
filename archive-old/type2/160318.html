&gt; I am totally addicted to that place. Every once in a while, I'll hop on the
&gt; website and order like 15 different things that will come out to like $100
&gt; bucks. Of course, it always takes near a month to get, but it's like
&gt; Christmas every time. Sure, it's all crap and it's all made in China, but
&gt; where else can you buy a 55lb Anvil for like $12 bucks?

As a FORMER member of AARP (American Association
of Anvil Producers), I'd just like to say, &quot;Thanks&quot;, for
helping to send my job to China... ;-(
