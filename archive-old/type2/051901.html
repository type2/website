Subject: [T2] BA-6 heater

Hello, we picked up a 78 westy a few weeks ago, and the van is in great
shape  80,454 miles, except NO HEAT What keeps happening is that it
blows fuse #9 when trying to start the BA-6 heater. Could someone please

explain the process in which the heater should start. With the engine
running and both levers down, once I turn the heater switch about 15-20
seconds later fuse #9 blows, the only other thing that seems to take
place is that a relay clicks over.

Thanks

Colin
