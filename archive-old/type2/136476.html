Subject: Re: [T2] once upon a pre-owned tuna can

Not everyone can afford either the time or money
required to keep a T2 afloat.   I readily acknowledge
that.  Someone with fewer time resources, or fewer
money resources, or someone who is attempting to build
a family....these are reasons for a Bus to Mitsubishi
move.  The T2 to Mitsubishi move is good for a person
whose life priorities differ from my own.
     
I have named my bus the not-so-appreciative term
&quot;M.P.&quot; which stands-for Money-Pit.  At this point in
my life, I choose to lavish my extra time and money on
fixing-up a pre-owned tuna can.  But I also
acknowledge, quite clearly, that the T2 is not my
primary vehicle.  It is not at all dependable.     It
is difficult to steer.  It is cold and dank to drive. 
It is cold-blooded and blalky at start-up.  There are
perpetually things to fix or tinker-with.  And from a
dependability stand-point, thank the maker for AAA and
tow trucks.  If you want a point-and-shoot vehicle,
then the Volvo's and Mitsubishi's and ......   fill
that bill.
    
But for a small population segment, the aura of T2
ownership is, is... I guess I can't put it in writing.
 Can one say I &quot;love&quot; my T2?  Is that appropriate? 
Accurate?
