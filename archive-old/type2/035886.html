&gt; 	I previously posted a (stupid?) question about my recent rebuild of my BN4

??? not sure if mine is a BA-4 on BN-4 will have to check before I start
throwing responses out, I think it is a BA-4 because it originally came
from a 412.

however to jump in, the fuel pump is the item that shuts off if anything
is not working properly, so check 

.  plug on blower motor
.  wire to fuel pump ground
.  thermo safety prob into heat chamber
.  also if you have the timer delay switch, it can sometimes have an
effect
.  check the hi temp safety fuse, if it blows the fuel pump shuts off

&gt; 	My problem is that I turn it on and get all systems go but fuel pump, which 
&gt; I can jump with a wire from the switch wire to the relay - very dangerous, 
&gt; but effective. Any similar experiences?

when I need to check out my system I clamp the fuel line so no fuel can
get through while I work on it.  but you can hear the pump run and all the
other parts can be tested but it won't actually fire.

good luck, was just up to Vermont in mine last week and when I pulled into
Rutland the bank sign said -15 and I had just finally zipped up the jacket
I was wearing....still had no gloves on though....they DO work!
