&gt; Hi JT,
&gt; 
&gt; I tried goo-gone to remove the adhesive that glued
&gt; the rubber covers  
&gt; to the front wheel wells. It wasn't helpful. A good
&gt; strong arm and a  
&gt; scraper will work wonders, followed by a repaint to
&gt; protect any newly  
&gt; exposed metal.

Depending of what you want to get off, next time I
would suggest Goof-Off. You can find in the paint dept
of you local Lowe's of Home Despot. Goo Gone is good
stuff, but it's a little sissy compared to Goof-Off.

That stuff is an awesome remover - just be careful
with it.

Greatness is the unconscious ability to act in ways that result in a smile and a thank you.
