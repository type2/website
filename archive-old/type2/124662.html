&gt;....get a good quality fire extinguser and put that in your bus tooo!....

I've been wondering about this for a while, where is the &quot;best&quot; or not so
best place to have mount your fire extinguisher?????

I have three fire extinguishers 2 mounted and one &quot;stashed&quot; the big one I
have mounted like this: (thanks for the Idea Don T.)
http://www.donimages_dot_com/1973bus/interior-before1.jpg?????...

And a not so big one mounted in the &quot;stock westie&quot; spot on the base of the
backseat/bed.

Is it worth mounting one in the rear cargo section, on the cabinet over the
spare tire well??? Would you be able to get to it in case of an engine
&quot;issue&quot;???

Come on folks lets hear some thoughts on this!!!!!!!!
