This isn't particularly unusual.  Our 1970 has a similar error ratio of about 
7 to 5.

You can easily calibrate your speedometer so you'll know exactly how fast 
you're actually traveling.  It's a lengthy discussion, and it's in the 
archives, so check there first.

If you're unable to retrieve that procedure, contact me off-List.

Hi -

I took my '73 bus on a small roadtrip this weekend to Wisconsin, which for the 
most part went ok.  The problem: my speedometer said I was doing around 70 
m.p.h. when I was really doing about 50m.p.h.  What the heck does that mean!?  
I guess it's always been that way, but I had NO clue it was so far off.  
Please help.

Thanks -
Michelle
