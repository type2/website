Subject: Record for Oil Changes?

hey now,

tommorrow i will be draining the oil once again so that i can try and fix
the leak around the oil temp sender. this will the third time in 5 days. is
this a record? i've got really clean oil to. Really really clean oil. i'm
going to buy another oil pan so that i can reuse the oil i put in last friday.
this shouldn't be a problem should it? also....i'm wondering if i can use some
sort of teflon sealer or silicone or something around the unit itself.
opinions?

jonathan
