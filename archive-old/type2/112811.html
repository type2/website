Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filter

I'm just curious how a line would blow off?  The fuel pressure regulator
would prevent extrodinarily high pressures in the system.  Plus, part of
the fuel pressure is being bled off by the fuel being used by the
engine...

I really have no idea what this thread was about, but it just sounded
kinda wierd so I thought I'd chime in ;)

&gt; clogged filter the one of fuel lines that are CLAMPED blows of because
&gt; of the high pressure generated by the pump.
