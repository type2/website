&gt; Where is the positive - red - plus battery post in your bay window VW.?

&gt; If the battery is on the right side, is the positive battery post toward the 
&gt; front, or toward the rear of the bus?

toward the rear of the bus, the positive is right beside the tailight
housing.

&gt; Q2:  To what, or to where does your battery ground wire connect.  On my '78, 
&gt; since my negative ground post is toward the front of the bus, the ground 
&gt; wire is bolted to the body, just under the ECU brain connector.  I don't 
&gt; know if this is original.

mine is an automatic and it is grounded to the front transmission mountt.

don't know if that is stock
