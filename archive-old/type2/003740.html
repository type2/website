&gt;hi volks,
&gt;    sorry to bother y'all but as we all know the site is down and i must
&gt;finish my rebuild this week.
&gt;Question: What do i use to etch the tin before painting (acid of some sort)
&gt;and is this really necessary? If it's clean bare metal does it need to be
&gt;etched?


I just use the wire brush on the grinder followed by sandblasting for the
tight spots.  Prime with PPG DP 90, and either leave it like that (semigloss
black) or CLV 9000 gloss black top coat.  Obviously, you can use different
DP numbers to prime for other colors.  I have never had any trouble getting
DP to stick to clean metal.  At least here in hot dry SoCal, the need to
etch is largely superstition.

Regards,

Grant
