Subject: carb bushings

A '71 westy with a 1776 engine was given to me as a present two years ago.
I think it has been on the road 6 months out of the 24 that I've owned it.
Part of this is due to the lack of time that plagues so many of us.  The
other part, however, is due to continuing problems getting a 1776 with dual
Kadrons  to work correctly.

Since September,  it has been on the test stand in the garage while I have
been doing a split-the-case rebuild.  Last week, I felt that it was finally
ready to reinstall in the bus  when I decided to search for vacuum leaks.
I dripped ethanol over every joint and, sure enough, the rpm shot up when I
reached the throttle plate on one of the Kadrons.  This drip test seems to
indicate that the throttle shaft needs to be rebushed.  The effect is quite
reproducible.

A year ago,  I was set back about a month for the same problem.  That time,
I found a source of just the throttle plate assemblies.  Now even these
&quot;new&quot; ones seem to be leaking.

In addition to my venting here,  I do have a few questions:
        1. Has anyone experienced continuing intake leaks through these shafts?
        2. If I find a shop to rebush these, can I count on the fix lasting
more than a few months?
        3.  Could my symptoms be caused by something other than the shaft
bushing.

Thanks, Jack
