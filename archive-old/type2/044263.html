&gt;I need some advice.  My '77 FI bucks as if missing when I drive with the

&gt;revs up fine and I can hold it at half throttle and it doesn't miss.  It
&gt;only bucks when the motor is under a load.  
Can't be fuel, or it wouldn't rev at all.  Gotta be electrics.  Somethings
breaking down under load. Probably timing, but might be a plug.  Get
another plug, and replace one at a time, testing each time under load.
