Hi Andy,

It is possible to import seals from the USA, but why dont you just go to
a
supplier in Germany. Even in Italy must be some vendors selling your
window
seals.

Just take a look around Europe before you go to the USA. I think it will
be
cheaper on this side of the ocean.

Aircooled greetings,

&gt; Just a question I am interested in...
&gt;
&gt; How do the glass stays on the windows? Is it just pressure on the
rubber
&gt; seal? If I need to change a window glass (or seal), do I just have to
&gt; pull hard and then push very strong to have it back in? Is there any
&gt; special tool I need?
&gt;
&gt; I wanted to change all seals on my '76 bus (many are bit cracked), but
&gt; here in Italy there's no easy way; so I thought I could purchase seals
&gt; cheaper from USA (bus depot) and then do the work myself.
&gt;
&gt; Is it possible?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt; A.
