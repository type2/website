I was playing around in the type2 archives and I found this post from
Hoover.  Reposting it under the circumstances will probably piss him
off, but it does bear repeating. It's something that we all should remember.

&gt; To All:
&gt;
&gt; Didja hear the one about the blind guys and the elephant?  Seems they went to
&gt; the circus and somebody decides to 'show' them an elephant.  The elephant must
&gt; have been a friendly soul because it allowed the blind guys to feel it all
&gt; over.
&gt;
&gt; After the circus was over the blind guys are in a bar telling their friends
&gt; about the elephant, which lead to a furious argument.  One blind guy insists
&gt; elephants are like snakes, because he happened to feel its trunk.  Another
&gt; blind guy swore elephants were like trees, because he happened to feel one of
&gt; its legs.  Another guy thought elephants were like enormous bats, having felt
&gt; one of the elephant's ears, and so on.
&gt;
&gt; A lot of messages on this Mailing List contain opinions with which I disagree.
&gt; If I have direct, personal experience to the contrary I may offer a different
&gt; opinion, especially if the matter is safety-related.  Otherwise, I don't,
&gt; because there's a strong liklihood my 'direct, personal experience'  was
&gt; nothing more than feeling the elephant's tail.  The other guy may be talking
&gt; through his hat but in most cases his opinion is just as valid as mine...
&gt; except he may have been feeling the elephant's trunk.
&gt;
&gt; Volkswagens... or anything else, for that matter, are elephants.  And all
&gt; humans are blind, in one way or another.
&gt;
&gt; The best advice I can offer is this:  Think for yourself.  Go find your own
&gt; elephant.  Feel it up.
