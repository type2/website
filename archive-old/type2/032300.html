I need help :'(

I installed my FI 1800cc in my '74 westy and can't get it to
start. I think that my problem is in the fuel system. I am definatly
getting spark at the plugs (pulled one plug out to see a little white
spark.... shouldn't it be blue?). I think the fault lies in either the
double relay, the wiring, or the fuel pump. So this is what I did. I wired
it up the right way. Nothing. suspected the wiring system to be faulty so
I wired the pump directly to the ignition switch .... when the key is
turned I can
feel/hear the pump click. But no whirrr, hum, or vibration. I think i can
hear
gas move through the lines, but maybe thats just my optimistic
imagination.  I seem to remember the pump
in my other bus hum and vibrate when operating. I'm doubtful that the
relay is shot, it worked when I
pulled it from my other bus, along with the entire FI system aside from
the fuel pump. Should the pump hum when it gets power? Is it supposed to
click? I can't really smell any gas in the engine compartment, no matter
how much I turn the starter, and I did a lot today, until the battery
died. I am just about ready to throw this whole FI system out the window
and go with those nice dual Weber 34ICT's I have on my type 3 engine in
the basement. But the whole intent of this project was to have a FI bus. 
Please help me help the FI :)


thanks,
Eddie Goodwin
