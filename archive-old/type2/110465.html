    I have done Yahoo, Altavista, MSN, Lycos, Type2 archive, The Samba, and
a few other places with not much exact luck. Either its about ppl who
already had it installed and no info on where purchased (I know, check to
see if there is a e-mail and ask, and hence why I am starting with the
masses before going door to door asking). I have searched for diamond plate,
chrome, chrome diamond plate, anti-fatigue plate, steel plate, flooring,
cabinets. &gt;&gt;

Try:

If not, try a place local to you that repairs trailers...
Not the Winnebago kind, the 40 footers...
