Man it's an awful sound, too.

&gt; I've never quite figured out how that thing is supposed to
&gt; help, but it must have a purpose or VW wouldn't have put it there in the
&gt; first place.

I spent about half an hour trying to figure out how it should work one
day, but came up with nothing.  I've no clue.  Anyone out there who does?

&gt; If anybody out there knows the secret to
&gt; keeping these roofs in place, please share it with the rest of us!!!

Here's the setup I got on my 73, due to a PO.  It's not stock, but it
works, so I'm not complaining.

Instead of the stock hold-down handles on the inside, I've got heavy
duty springs.  When unextended, the springs are about 3-4 inches.  I
hook them onto brackets that are where the handles used to be.  I think
the brackets on the poptop are actually leftover from the stock handles,
but I'm not sure.  The springs are tough to stretch, but they pull the
poptop down really snug against the roof.

The PO also had a latch in the front, but I removed it to clean it, and
have never put it back on.  It didn't seem to help much, but one which
does might be an answer?

The other non-stock feature of my poptop is the seal.  I don't know how
well a stock seal fits, but mine is that foam weatherstripping you can
buy at the hardware store, all along the inside lip.  It's really thick,
so it makes a good seal, which I think helps prevent updrafts from
shifting the roof around.

I'd like to make all of these modifications a bit more classy someday,
but for now they work.

&gt; The worst part about the roof lifting up a bit while driving is all the cold
&gt; air that comes in from up there!

I once met a guy who put a heavy duty quilted blanket up inside the
openning.  I haven't tried it, but it might prevent drafts and reduce
the noise levels somewhat.

Just a few thoughts,
