Subject: Does PCV valve have any moving parts?

Hi Volks,

The saga of my oil leak in the '78 Westfalia continues. To recount: It seems
like I've got positive crankcase pressure that blows my dipstick up a little
at high RPM. Then oil splashes out of the dipstick tube, runs into my fan and
gets slung all over everywhere. But my compression is 130+ psi all around, so
I doubt my rings are worn and causing blowby, so how to fix this? My once
immaculate engine is now really oily and getting pretty dirty. :-(

The archives and e-mails from helpful listees have led me to inspect my PCV
valve. If plugged up, this could impede crankcase ventilation and cause my
problem. So I pull it all off. There's a little, loaf-shaped metal box on top
of the engine in the rear, just ahead of the fan housing. It sits on an
apparently intact cork gasket and is held on a box-shaped pedestal that leads
into the crankcase and is held in place by a wire clip. It is hollow and
empty, oily but unobstructed.

Atop that is a plastic part (VW part # 39 000 60 917 MHO, Bosch part # 022 115
303 A) held down by two 10mm nuts. Crankcase fumes enter it from a round hole
in the bottom, pass through a baffle, and go sideways out a tube into the
crankcase ventilation hose that returns them to the air intake. I think this
part is the PCV valve. The name seems like a misnomer since mine has no moving
parts and appears to be more of a baffle and oil trap than an valve. I cleaned
it up and I can blow through it pretty clearly. There is a constriction in
there that limits flow to a channel about 2mm in diameter. The top of the part
is disk shaped, like it might contain a diaphragm, but there is none inside as
far as I can tell. There is a plastic shaft in the center of the hole into the
unit from below.This shaft has a rough, oblique face, as if maybe it were the
broken off stub of something larger. Or maybe not. Is something supposed to be
protruding from the hole in the bottom of the unit, or is this just a guide
for oil drips to fall from?

My questions to the group: 
1- Is this the PCV valve?
2- If the passage is clear, is there anything else that could be wrong with
this thing? It looks pretty bombproof to me. 
3- The Bus Depot doesn't seem to have this part. Neither does FLAPS. Who sells
these? How much might one pay?
4- Could I be leaking badly through/ under the cork gasket? It looks intact, but...


This oil leak is really vexing me. Thanks for any and all suggestions.
