Subject: Re: [T2] Best Spark Plugs for my 76 2.0L FI

Glad you ranted on about this --Shake the carbon out from betwen your
ears and read on--

Changing your one way mind is like talking to a brick.

You run the Splitfires you read all about--I'm busy.

And I am not really interested in what the guys from Chrysler/ Benz/
Freightshaker have to say--they are on the same one way street your mind
is on.

I believe nothing I read--Test,test, test--Dr. Quackinbush---that's how
conclusions are drawn.

Now--I'll elaborate on how I came to
These findings--as well as a bunch of other folks in this area at the
time.

Back in 1968 I was working as a technician at a BSA Triumph, Bultaco,
Bridgestone dealer--and in the winter we also sold snowmobiles, which
back in the early days--there was all kinds of off brands--Snowbird was
the name of them--they ran JLO, Hirth,( made in Deutschland) two stroke
engines, which just happen to come equipt with Champion plugs--and the
engines didn't have any kind of oil injection-meaning regardless where
the throttle was at--it got a full load of oil--idling or WFO--and the
plugs continually fouled--and hence the engines quit running an a
regular basis--which made for very unhappy customer's.
Ok--one fine winter day--the NGK tech shows up, introducing a new spark
plug--
Gold platinum tipped plugs--yea right--

I figure--let bust this guys balls--with these Kraut two stroke
engines--and watch him cringe--

The engines ran--and at idle as well as WFO for 4 times as long-without
failing--
Hmm---interesting.

Triumph as well as BSA's came with a plug you probably in your shallow
life never even heard of--KLG's--

the std plug was an FE 80--one heat range hotter was an FE 100--and they
were OK--but also fouled easy--especially if the seat's in the carbs,
were not set properly from the Meridian Plant in the Motherland--which
happened often--they were peened in the bowl's--.

So as an experiment we ran the NGK platinum tipped plugs--and they did
not foul.

So from that point on--ALL the plugs when ALL the bikes got set up--ALL
got the plugs changed to NGK platinum tipped plugs.

We took on Yamaha, when Bridgestone failed--and they ALL came with NGK
plugs from the factory--hey--what does Yamaha know--they are just
dummies--right DR, Doom?

Since my introduction to the platinum lugs back in 68--I have run them
in;
378 motorcycles I've owned---(you want the band names years and models
Dr. Quakenbush--fine--wait there --I'll send them to ya later.)
432 automobiles I've owned and driven--from Amphicars to Zundaps .
And they all had gold tipped plugs with no plug related failures--as a
Champion or cheap run of the mill Bosch would do--fail.
 ( Champion and Bob Bosch are in the same family I believe )
6 boats of different sizes and engines--but all automotive type
inboard's--they ran the NGK platinum tipped plugs--.

I don't know where you are coming from here DOc--but you must be running
out of toilet paper in yout outhouse and just happen to read some of
your wiping material --
I read read nothing--no time--
I get to the bottom of the issue and have found that the NGK gold
platnium tipped plugs ( all one heat range hotter than stock) work
excellent--and have used them in every vehicla I own--including the 6 I
have now--
My K-75 BMW,BMW 325IS, Triumph T-100-R, 85 Vanbagon GL, 87 Vanagon
Westy, and last but not the least my 74 Westy--no plug failures, and run
them twice as lomg as standard plugs with no fouling, hot spots, or
whatever else you have claimed to have veiwed.

Keep reading the garbage that MOPAR isuues--good toilet paper material.

I disagree.
The platinum tip plugs will have a preponderance of running cleaner for
a longer period of time Tim, with a longer electrode life.
Mercedes testing proves otherwise. You are repeating ad hype. It's the
only way you can justify your wisdom in knowing better than those who
know so much more than you, you aren't a pimple on their arse. You got
magnets on your fuel lines, too??? All the hype says they will improve
your combustion. Put them on there then give us your testimony
justifying your wisdom.
As long as the plug is within the proper heat range, it will not cause
one iota of a problem---
And I don't care if the element was made out of Titanium--the heat range
is what is   most important---
Spark energy meaning nothing???? Spark duration??
last twice as long as the standard---run of the mill plugs, and run
cleaner for longer.
Amazing, you conclude exactly what the hype says. What a genius.
I have also found NGK gold plantnium tipped plugs to be superior to the
overpriced Bosch plugs anyday.
But this is my findings---
Bet Mercedes spent $100,000 or more getting their data, and likely
representing millions of miles of stress. But they are only one whimper
of a voice proving the hype is hype. You are the target of wizbang
marketing and the reason it works. I mean, a mountain of claims and
testimonials just has to be better than a one page conclusion of
qualified engineers based upon a big stack of real experimental data.
I'm the rare bird. I'll follow a thimble full of engineers opinions base
upon real testing and data before casting into an ocean of layman
indoctrined by sales marketing agendas.
And this subject is another go no where--personal preference subject
like tire's, toilet paper, and jello--run what you have found to work
the best, regardless what Benz has to say---
Yes, if you ignore the engineers, you can pick and chose among
testimonies with no real experiment, no real data.
Go ahead and put AP plugs in your T-IV. Just hold them next to the CC's
and tell me if you see any differences, like half an inch shorter reach.
Watch out for over torque as you will have 1/3 the number of threads in
play. And if you ever try to put the stock long reach plugs back in,
what happens when the lower threads hit the carbon build up. Suggest you
buy the Split Fire plugs.
