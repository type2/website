In this case I'd try rigging the hoist's boom as close to horizontal as
possible, and as high as possible inside the back of the bus.  Then I'd rig
a compact hoist to the boom, with it's hook supporting soft nylon slings
around the engine.  The engine would be lowered using the compact hoist,
_not_ the boom.  The boom would just provide a &quot;skyhook&quot; for the compact
hoist.

[ If you think this is a hassle, you should see what it takes to pull the
engine(s) from a largish power cruiser :-) ]

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  On a 74-up, where the Bus has both a rear hatch and a top lid, now
that's a
different story.  You'd need enough chain on the crane that the crane's boom
has to touch, or come real close to, the ceiling of the Bus.  By the time
the
engine's on the floor, the crane boom would still be above the rim of the
cargo door.  &lt;&lt;
