&gt;         I may have a solution to your problem. Mount a tow hitch on both front and
&gt; rear bumper. Then mount an electric winch on a piece of tube with a fitting
&gt; for the tow hitch (don't know what that part is called in english).

Receiver!
       BTW, why are the vanagons so lousy in deep snow compared to the breadloaf?

Vanagons have more weight on the front wheels, partly the same reason they are more
stable in crosswinds! More like 40-60 front- rear instead of 35-65 or something. I've
noticed it too. I usually throw in 4 bags of water softener salt in the rear, that's
320lbs (145kg). makes it work okay. Just dump them into the water softener come April!
