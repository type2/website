Subject: RE: [T2] RE: tired--Vredestein vs. Hankook RA08

&gt; The (non-winter) Comtracs on my bus in 185R14C are stamped
&gt; with a maximum load rating of 1874 lbs, load index 102, Load
&gt; Range D.  The Hankooks have the same markings.  I don't
&gt; really see a downside either!!


Interesting. I took the specs I quoted directly off of Vredestein's spec
sheet. But the ones on the sidewall itself would be the most accurate, of
course. Actually this is the second time that I've found a disparity between
the Vredestein technical spec sheet and the tire itself (both slightly in
the tire's favor). Either they need a better proof-reader, or the guy who
wrote the spec sheets was being a little overcautious!
