wow, that is weird...the exact same thing happened to my 71 westy when i 
first got it....the regulator was messed up so the red gen light wasn't 
functioning....i thought, well the belt is brand new..so i can probably make 
a safe quick trip fo new orleans to lafayette to party.....about half way 
there i just happened to notice that the rear end was on fire.....man, i 
grabbed the fire extinquisher, and opened the back.....of course the 
extinquisher had lost its charge....so...i took off most of my clothes and 
proceded to smother out the fire...much to the amusement of 
passers-by......well, after spending $90 to get towed back by a guy who 
cruised the highway looking for broken-down suckers....i checked out the 
motor..what happened was the belt had broken, and after a couple of minutes 
the head melted on #3 spark plug hole and blew out the plug..that is where 
the fire was from...fortunately the fuel line didn't melt or it would have 
been terminal....i rebuilt the motor and it cruises great now...that was 
like ten years ago....so anyways...be sure both the gen and oil light are 
both working...or don't drive it...!!!!
