Subject: '76 Westy Weekender

Does anyone out there have information re: what elements were &quot;stock&quot; on a '76 Westy w/Weekender package? I am purchasing a partially converted Transporter and would like to finish the conversion project with ALL the &quot;stock&quot; elements and parts. The body is in excellent shape w/ a 2L pancake engine that runs good. It'll make a good project. Also, does anyone have any drawings or illustrations or know where I might obtain some of a '76 Weekender interior? Thanks a bunch in advance.
