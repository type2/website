Subject: Re: Rear Wheel bearings

DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT AN EXPERT, this is only my personal experience:
When replacing rear bearings, if you tighten the castle nut BY HAND (and
don't know IF it is the &quot;necessary pounds of pressure&quot;), even standing on
the cheater bar, make sure to retighten every month or so until it
doesn't tighten any more. You may think it is as tight as it can go, but
as you drive, the bearings may compress into place and the castle nut may
need to be cinched down some more or else it may eat up those brand new
bearings... ask me how I know... If you have the resources to tighten it
down and KNOW it is the proper #s of pressure, good for you, but I didn't
and now I have to do it all over again, less than a year later.

Oh, and the advice to replace brakes and all while you are there... good
advice. I did that and it was worth it. It is more of a PITA to tear it
apart again later to do that, than do it now while you are already in
there replacing the bearings. Also, I suggest replacing the CV boots
since you have to remove them to get the spindle out, anyway. Boot kit
runs about $10-15 each, comes with grease and new clamps and it will save
you from having to do it again later if it tears. (this adds up fast,
doesn't it? lol)

 Bentley says precise torque is  essential.
&gt; What's the scoop on this job?
