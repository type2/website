Subject: Horn woes 2

ok so i think i maybe just rewired it wrong here is my impression of what it 
should be.  The black and yellow hot wire goes straight from the horn to the 
fuse box. The brown wire is supposed to be in two part one running from the 
horn button to a nut underneath, and the other brown running from the horn 
to some unknown to me spot on the column. Correct this please if im wrong, 
but if its right please tell me where the horn brown is supposed to connect 
to. At the moment i have it wired black and yellow to fuse, and one brown 
from the horn to the horn button
