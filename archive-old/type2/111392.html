Subject: 77 Riviera for sale in central NC area

since i just purchased a 69 Single Cab, the 77 Riviera has got to go.  i
don't really want to part with it, but right now i just can't afford to
keep 2 busses on the road.

the good news:
-brand new set of Yokohama 356 Load Range D tires (less than 500 mi. on them)
-i have (not installed) the following parts to go with the bus:
        2 new front brake rotors
        new brake pads
        new brake flexi-lines for front
        steering damper
        front brake hardware kit
-new ignition switch installed by professional mechanic.
-same mechanic as above replace an exhaust stud in the driver's side
        cylinder head.
-all fuel lines replaced.
-interior is unique - has 50/50 folding rear bed/seat.
-pop-top &amp; canvas in great shape


the bad:
-nose damage on passenger side.
-body needs attention in a couple of areas.
-some rust around windows.
-windshield leak needs attention.
-needs front brake work, for which i have all parts.
-muffler will need to be replaced soon.

i have about $1700 in this bus, including the not-yet-installed parts. 
make me an offer! i also have a few other parts lying around
that i could throw in to sweeten the deal.

i can send pictures, but currently i have limited access to my email.

for inquiries, please call me at 919-466-9472. i am in the Raleigh, NC area.

thanks,

Joel Wilson
