Dear Richard,
Here in Texas, (I'm in Kerrville, 60 miles NW of San Antonio), I use 30 wt
Castrol spring, fall and winter, and change to 40 wt Castrol in the (hot)
summer.
Hope this helps,

Tom

&gt; I'm putting the engine in this weekend and I'd appreciate hearing directly
&gt; from anyone with a recommendation of which weight oil to use here in Texas
&gt; (don't want to start a huge thread on the topic). Also what weight gear
oil
&gt; is recommended for a manual transmission? -- Richard 78 Westfalia Owner
&gt;
&gt; New engine HD30.  For break in at least.
&gt; &gt;From there you can switch to 20-50 or stay straight 30 or 40 (if it is
&gt; really hot in the summer).
&gt;
&gt; I tend to stay HD30 all year now in Georgia.  My reason being that the
heat
&gt; in the heads is enough to break multi viscosity oil down to a straight
&gt; weight quickly anyway.  So might as well leave out the extra stabilizers
and
&gt; just go straight weight.  Make sure the oil has an API &quot;SL&quot; rating (over
the
&gt; cheaper oils having &quot;SJ&quot;) since it is the latest and greatest.  Granted in
&gt; the owners manual the factory grade at the time of manufacture was like
&gt; &quot;SG&quot;, so oil does evolve over time.
&gt;
&gt; As for the tranny GL-4 for ALL VW bus manuals.  Do not get GL-5!  Only in
&gt; the automatic was GL-5 used.
&gt;
&gt; Lots of past threads on this, hit the archives for a weeks worth of
reading.
