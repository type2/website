&gt; I recently bought what seemed like such a great deal...  a 1978 bus (Champagne edition) in questionable shape, great engine, no rust, etc...  Unfortunately, the transmission seems to be blown.  I'm up in the wilds of New England, where we don't have California's unlimited number of used VW's.  My question is, which years used the same type of transmission as the one I already have?  I can't afford to get one mail order (Bill Gates couldn't afford some of these prices!) so my choices are limited to what's available within the junkyards in my state.


how far up into New england,  there is supposed to be a large VW yard in
the Albany area.  also a little further South in Maryland there is a guy
with a lot of VW vans and stuff, he is coming to Boston in the near future
to visit family (think he lurks on this list occasionally) who may be
convinced to bring one up to you
