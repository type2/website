Subject: Re: [T2] Idiot lights and other assorted questions

&gt; I would think the system shouldn't lose pressure that quickly but I
&gt; figured I would ask the
&gt; experts since the light does seem to work just fine and comes on in the
&gt; first position if shes been sitting a while.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know how quickly the oil system should depressurize?
&gt;

Mine takes no more than 10-15 seconds for the light to come on after
shutdown, and it's a pretty tight engine (new, not rebuilt, in 2002).  I'd
expect that it's a heat-related failure if the light still doesn't come on
after it's been sitting for many minutes.  Marginal electrical connections
tend to get worse when they're hot, so I think it's a bad connection to the
wire at the sender, or, failing that, a bad sender.

I could be wrong.  Your engine is not identical to mine.
