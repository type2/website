&gt; On the return trip to Tacoma his humongous 1985 Ford 4WD diesel pickup,

&gt; non-repairable.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Bottom line:  The long-block ALONE cost $7,000.00!!!  This was a nearly 
&gt; complete engine, lacking just the alternator and AC pump.  Out the door with a 
&gt; factory 24 month - 24,000 mile warranty he squeaked in at just under 
&gt; $8,000.00.

&gt; Proof positive that old Type 2s really are an economical mode of

&lt;putting on his best yiddish accent&gt; So this is news??????  :-))))

Whenever anyone says to me that they are considering a new car, I ask if
they are averaging more than $3600 in repair costs over the last year.
Figure your *minimum* new car payments at $300/month and multiply by 12.

At the same time, tho, I ask anyone who says to me &quot;GEE... I always wanted
to own one of those!&quot; whether they have ever changed their own oil.  Old
type 2's are still cheap to own and sevice, T1 or T4 engined, but both are
high maintainace vehicles.  If you can and will maintain it yourself, it
is very cheap to own, but if you're going to pay someone to do it for you
(your local mechanic), be rich, or be broke!!!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
