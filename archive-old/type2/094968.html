Subject: High Country Bus Festival: Buddah's Trip Report

What a wonderful weekend of Buses in the mountains.  There were over 150
buses that made the trek to Boone..........and I thank all of you.
Chris S. took the time to paste a few picture together to give us a
panoramic view of the entire campground on saturday afternoon........to see 
those panoramic pics:

The weather this year could not have been more perfect for the festival, in 
other words no rain.  I got up to the campground on tuesday earlier that 
week and it was raining pretty hard...........I was worried, but glad for it 
all to fall then as opposed to the weekend.

The local newspaper the Watauga Democrat printed a story on the front page 
of their Friday paper about the impending arrival of Buses in the area.  
While the author choose to call BUSES &quot;bugs&quot; and misquote camping cost 
info,, the article is not that bad.......and congratulations to David Woods 
from Salem, VA who got a picture of his bus on the front page!  here is a 
link to that article:

Royce Keithly was the first bus (besides me) there on Wednesday followed by 
Jim and Sharon Houston. Jim and Sharon had left their home in Florida back 
in June and made a cross country trek prior to comming to HCBF! Let's not 
forget Mel Wilson who joined them on this trek!

The Tennessee Mechnized arrived early on Thursday........and never again
will I ever attempt to win the award for best campsite. It wasnt so much
the wall to wall carpeting, the recliners or even the 
couchs...........butwhen they installed a celing fan I realized I could 
never compete.  What a super set-up, much nicer than what I have at home 
:-).  Thanks to all of the TN mechanized for helping to set-up and run the 
FMBC breakfast burritos!  a few more buses arrived on thursday night just in 
time for our last rain shower of the weekend.

Friday AM the sun came out and stayed out!  Buses were flowing into the
campground all day.  We all took it easy, got camp set-up, visited with old 
friends and made some new ones.  Friday night we were entertained with 
Kareokee in the &quot;BOOD-WAH&quot; lounge. Thanks to all the kids who lined up to 
sing...............(the adults were less anxious Kathy Jacobs and myself 
were the only crooners who were old enough to drive!)
Special thanks to Mad Uncle Dave who brought us a HUGE wood pile, we were 
able to have a big fire on friday and saturday night.

Saturday morning the FMBC burritos were served and once again, there was
more than enough food to fill everyone's belly!  YUMMY!!!!  Later that
morning Steve Dolan and Marc Derring hosted a techincal class covering many 
aspects of bus maintnence.......... lots was learned by all who attended. 
Lynn Blankenship and Debbie Jarrett hosted some kids activitied that morning 
as well. There was fun to be had by all!

Later that afternoon the live musical stylings of BESSIE MAE's DREAM took 
the stage; they are a jam band from Charlotte, NC.  THey played from about 
4:30 until 7:30.  Special thanks to Steve Waldoch who brought a 50 foot 
inflatable dancing man which he inflated on top of his beautiful splitty 
camper.  (click below too see a pic of the inflatable dancing man)

Saturday night we had out Hot Wing Cook-Off and Pot-Luck dinner -
congratulations to Frank Biffath who won the Wing Cook off!

Then it was time for the VW Family Feud - Blistered Dawson flew in from
California to host the game show.  This was a lot of fun, thanks to
everyone who helped to run the game show.  I am very busy right now, but
sometime soon I will post the survey results to the List.

The RAFFLE was a successes as well, we were able to raise $145 for the Type 
2 list with the prize raffle and there was $164 raised for the Full Moon Bus 
Club in the 50/50 raffle...............I am sorry that I forgot their name, 
but someone won $164 (the other half of the 50/50 raffle)

The People's Choice Awards were then given out.  As they say in Hollywood;
.........and the winner is...........unfortunately, I &quot;lost&quot; the index card 
with the names on it,  actually I had a roving band of groopies that were 
falling all over each other to get the index cards, and I think one of them 
might have gotten the card. I tried to remember those that won, and fell 
short.......

-  Best Group Campsite:  Tennessee Mechanized
-  &quot;Drool Award&quot;:  Richard &quot;Dicko&quot; Austin -  tye-dyed hightop
-  Most in need of RUSTeration
-  Best Individual Campsite
-  Trailer Queen - Kurt Hucks  99 EVC with tow behind pop-up trailer
-  Homeland Security Award (bus most likely to get pulled by the cops)

We also had a ton of door prizes for the adults and the kids, thanks to all 
who donated!

Saturday Night ended with LIVE BLUEGRASS from local pickers &quot;Lost Ridge&quot; As 
they were playing the entire field was lit up......the case burning had 
begun........all hail the case !!

Sunday morning we set-out on the caravan at 10:30, we had 60+ buses in the 
carabus along the blue ridge parkway.  We end the ride at a Price Park a 
local picnic and gathering spot.  As we pulled in there was an outdoor 
church service taking place, the preacher was dancing around with his arms 
in the air just a preaching'....(his back was to us) but his entire 
congregation was seated on the ground and picnic tables to where they had no 
choice but to look at us........you could see their dilemma, they wanted to 
jump up and run over to the buses, but they tried very hard to keep their 
eyes on their preacher.....he ended his service shortly after our arrival in 
the park.

From Price Park a group of us 20+ buses went into Boone for a wonderful 
lunch at the Mellow Mushroom......the rest of the folks headed home from the 
park.

Sorry for the confusion on the award winners,  they each received very nice 
hand made trophies:  valve covers from a junkyard were sandblasted to bare 
metal and had buses painted onto them!

There are a lot of people whom I need to thank and I HOPE I don't forget
anyone: Rob Henley(raffle), Ian James(the Feud), Tom Cates(the Feud), Jay 
Blankenship(the Feud), Jennifer Murphy(EVERYTHING), Mad Uncle
Dave(EVERYTHING), Cliff Styles(sound), Dicko(EVERYTHING), Kurt
Hucks(breakfast), Wild Bill(Raffle), Steve Dolan and Marc Derring(tech
class), Frank Biffath(fire guru), Eric Best(door prizes) ......I could not 
have pulled this weekend off -- or kept my sanity without ALL of your help.

Thanks again to everyone who helped to make this years festival such a 
wonderful weekend!

- Buddah
