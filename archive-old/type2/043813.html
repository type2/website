Subject: [T2] I've given in ..... Bus for sale (longish)

Rather than spend thousands of guilders to convert a loaf to diesel
operation (running real diesel or Mac Donalds waste) I went out and bought a
1996 diesel VW-bus yesterday (we call them T4 - 4th generation Transporter,
you guys call them Eurovan).

I really love my air-cooleds and am still fond of my '81 diesel Vanagon but
the urge to have a really reliable car made me go ahead and get a fairly new
one. When driving my older cars I always have this question in the back of
my mind: &quot;What is going to fail next?&quot;. The vanagon was my daily driver and
never left me stranded but it required more maintenance than I liked. New
transmission, new engine, new water-pipes, new rotors etc etc.
I'm still keeping it (it's a camper) but not as the work horse anymore. The
aircooleds are purely for fun and are only allowed to play outside when it's
not raining.

Since I now am the owner of 5 buses I decided this is one too many. So with
pain in my heart I am going to sell one car. It's going to be the '78
automatic, 8 seater. I really have no purpose for it and it takes up
valuable storage space. Remember I live in Holland (Europe) so inquiries
from overseas do not really make sense (or you must be very determined). But
to whet your appetite you can look at it on

BTW. I could have opted for one of those modern cars that all the other
'normal' people seem to like so much. But I figured I'd stay in style and
buy another bus. The 1.9 D (non-turbo) has a whopping 60 hp (yes that's
right only sixty horses) so the culture-shock is not too big. I must say I
was impressed. It's quiet, yet the engine is less than 3 feet away from the
driver. I got it up to about 85 mph (140 kmh) without too much of an effort.
Having a 5 speed gearbox probably helps in all this.
