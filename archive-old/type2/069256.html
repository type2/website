&gt; I just paid $32.50 to fill my 40 lb tank with a 75/25% CO2 Argon mix.  Is
&gt; this about the going rate?

I paid less than $25 for my 40 lb tank, a neat size tank BTW for anyone 
looking not useless like a 20 but a lot shorter than a 60, keeps from
tipping.  This price was like 6 months ago and I got their shop price,
it was the Argon/CO2 mix.
