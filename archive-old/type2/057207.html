Quoth Mike Gensler:
 &quot;First Make sure you have a paint mark on the pulley at #3 TDC (180
degrees from #1).  Then check your timing at 3000 rpm with your strobe
timing light attached to the #1 plug wire and using the #1 mark.  Make a
note of your total advance. Now hook the timing light to the #3 wire and
check your timing there. If it is the same, no retard.  If it's less
advanced then your #3 is being retarded.&quot;

Trying to compare timing advance differences at &quot;maximum&quot; advance (rpm's)
isn't too accurate when looking at less than 3 degrees (built into the
cam)- you can check this easily at idle, since the ONLY varable then is
when you move the timing pickup from #1 wire to #3- and see the retard
easily.  Oddly, I've seen this retard built into distributors for engines
obviously designed with doghouse oil coolers and I think even on type 4's!
