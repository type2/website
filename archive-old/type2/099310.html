Subject: Re: Hillman Fastener

&gt; Any other tips re: stores with great selections of metric hardware is also
&gt; appreciated.

Over the last 3 years the South Bay has lost at least 3 really good hardware
stores as Home Depot and OSH have ramped up their efforts to break each other.
There is hope though.  Mr Metric at 960 N. 10th in San Jose should be able to
provide you with anything you need.  Their number is 286-8816.
