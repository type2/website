&gt;   I am working on getting a 1971 bay. I have a friend who owned a couple

I've owned several buses, including a 71.

&gt; of them, and hes expressed his wisdom and experience to myself and my
&gt; wife. My wife is no longer comfortable with my getting the bus.
&gt; So I am figuring that there are a few points of his that I need to refute.
&gt; I am going to list them below, and I would like other opinions about these
&gt; points of contention.
&gt;
&gt; - You have to replace the engine every 50,000 miles

my 71 engine went 112,000 miles mostly abused miles the rebuild would have
cost about $800
&gt;
&gt; - There are 2 .50 cent gaskets that when they go bad, all the oil leaks
&gt; out quickly.

yes, but in 30 years of driving I've never had a valve cover gasket fail.
at least not enough to lose any amount of oil that would damage the engine
in a week or so

&gt; - Throttle linkage gets stuck on full easily.

any linkage can get stuck if it is not maintained, the only one I ever had
get stuck was in the off position and it wasn't on my 71
&gt;
&gt; - Fuel line gets cut by firewall. this one I am aware of, I am wondering
&gt; what the best fix is for it, and can it be done with the engine in.

easy fix,  and it can be done with engine in.

&gt; - The Skid plate under the front end is impossible to put back in place.

wish I had known that,, I have taken mine off and put it back on hundreds
of times over the years, and other than keeping stuff all the linkages and
cold draft off your feet it doesn't do anything critical

&gt; If anyone can help me cover these points so that I can ease my partners
&gt; mind, I would appreciate it. As I am new to the bus arena, I want to make
&gt; sure I have my facts straight.

well having a partner I know that I am only happy when they are happy so
they either have to agree or you will never really enjoy your bus.

my 78 now has 322,000 miles on it and I plan on keeping it runninng as
long as possible, and it helped me meet my wife so what can I say

good luck
Bob
