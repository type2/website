Subject: Re: [T2] 79 Bus Rear End Noise - 2nd Post

Hi Jason,

I saw the original post but was too busy to get on it.....  I have seen 
this on a bus before.

Check your motor mounts, you want to check on the two rubber blocks 
that bolt the mustache bar to the block. They aren't easy to see as 
they are in front of the fan shroud, but when they break they will lead 
to this sort of behavior as the engine flops around. They're a PITA to 
replace, but at least they aren't expensive.

Put a jack under the engine, and watch the mounts as you lift the 
engine. Don't lift too far, or you could wreck the mounts even if they 
are good.

This is why you should never lift the bus from a jack placed under the 
motor

Happy trails,

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I posted this message over the weekend, but didn't get any responses.  
&gt; Hopefully this one will generate more helpful advice.
&gt;
&gt; Here's the deal:  My 1979 Westy has been making a noise at the 
&gt; driver's side rear wheel.  Over flat ground it goes 
&gt; rumble-rumble-squeak-squeak, but over bumps it makes a clunk each time 
&gt; the wheel hits something.  I have replaced the wheel bearings and both 
&gt; CVs on that side, and have no play in the wheel when I jack it up and 
&gt; wiggle it.  I checked the suspension components, and they are all 
&gt; tight.  In addition, I checked the transmission mounting points, and 
&gt; they are all tight as well.
