Subject: RE: [T2] TYPE 2=Truck?????

&gt; I am curious to know if the type 2  was marketed
&gt; as a &quot;truck&quot; or as &quot;car&quot; when introduced to the US
&gt; market.


Volkswagen marketed it as a &quot;station wagon&quot; in the U.S. to skirt the 25%
import tariff on imported trucks (which was levied in 1963 due to a trade
dispute over chicken exports) . That tariff (still referred to as the
&quot;chicken tax&quot;) exists to this day, thanks to aggressive U.S. automotive
industry lobbying.  Japanese companies skirted it by importing their trucks
as &quot;components&quot; and doing the final assembly (i.e. bolting the bed to the
chassis) in the U.S.. But Volkswagen didn't have a U.S. facility to do this
in (other than their short-lived Rabbit plant in Westmoreland, PA), hence no
single-cabs and crew-cabs since 1971.
