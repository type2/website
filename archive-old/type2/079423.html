Hi Dave,
Who knows why buses are so popular?
All of the reasons I originally used to justify buying
one to my wife have been contradicted.
Buses chew fuel compared to modern cars &amp; you're
right...they are draughty &amp; tend to be vehicles of
finite acceleration.
It still doesn't change the fact though that my wife's
happiest moments are with me when we travel in our bus
&amp; those times when we owned a camper &amp; slept in it.
Many people when they find out that I own a bus sigh
like remembering their best childhood memories(in fact
many are:-) and they look fondly upon pics on my
website and are always interested in taking a ride.
Buses are a breath of fresh air out of the motoring
past when it wasn't important where you were going or
how fast you got there &amp; that the most important thing
was to chill out &amp; enjoy the ride.
I'm proud to preserve that legacy &amp; there's nothing
better on a sunny Sunday afternoon than piling into
the bus &amp; heading out onto the open road.
:-)
Cheers &amp; keep bussing,
Andrew Wood

&gt; I had a chance today to discover just how attached I
&gt; have become to my 74 Bus in the few short months
&gt; that I have been 'daily-driving' her.
&gt; 
&gt; For the past couple of days I have been driving the
&gt; company truck, an F-250 pickup. It has a fairly good
&gt; ride, plenty of power, cruise control, scads of heat
&gt; and/or air conditioning, and a really nice Alpine
&gt; sound system. I've been zipping around town and made
&gt; a few 100 mile round trip runs to our other plant,
&gt; all in relative comfort and ease.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I got into my bus this afternoon to head home
&gt; for the weekend. The sun was bright but the temps
&gt; were in the low 50's with a cold wind biting out of
&gt; the northwest. I climbed in and started her up,
&gt; nursing the pedal until the engine smoothed out. I
&gt; crackled up and down the radio dial, finally
&gt; settling for a local pop station that would come in
&gt; fairly clearly.  As I drove through town on my home
&gt; home, catching every red light, I realized that I
&gt; was more comfortable in my cold, drafty,
&gt; underpowered bus than  I ever had been while driving
&gt; the truck. Or any other vehicle I've ever owned.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't be alone in this, can I? I know I can't be
&gt; since all of you are on this list with me. What is
&gt; it about these vehicles that gives them such power
&gt; over us? By modern standards they fall short in
&gt; nearly ever catagory, yet we choose them over all
&gt; others.  Why? I get asked this question all the time
&gt; but so far I haven't come up with an answer that
&gt; satisfies me, or them.
&gt; 
&gt; I do know one thing. For me, it isn't so much the
&gt; road less traveled, it's the vehicle less traveled
&gt; in that holds the appeal.
&gt; 
&gt; Just rambling,
&gt; Dave
