I need to replace the extractor on my 71 Bus (1776cc) and am considering
getting another Gene Berg exhaust and doing the welded flange treatment,
then ceramic coating the whole thing.  I'd like to hear from anyone who has
successfully installed the lower flange kit and how you made clearance for
the rear mount. It looks to me like an extension pipe will need to be welded
in on the right side exchanger anyway.  My first Berg exhaust was
professionally chrome plated but the plating only lasted a couple years.  It
did however fit better than the Thunderbird I replaced it with that has now
gone south.  I am open to any alternatives on a &quot;quality&quot; exhaust system...I
want the next one to last and be absolutely leak free.

Also if anyone has experience with Performance Coatings or can recommend a
reputable company to ceramic coat the exhaust (NW possibly?) that would be
appreciated.

Thanks much,

Steve Trembley
