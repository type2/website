Subject: Regulator 71 bus

Hello,

Anyone have info on how to tell if the regulator is working properly.  My
bus continually has trouble sustaining a charge and starting even though I
replaced the starter a couple of months ago.  The Battery is new but I am
not sure if the generator is working either.

Any help would be appreciated.
