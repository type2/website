Subject: 'rescue' of Joel's double cab

        Richard Palmer,
        I'm jealous, I freely admit it, but I can't credit your 
buying Joel's double-cab '68 as a rescue, or much of a search. 
If you want credit for search and rescue, you've got to find and save 
something at risk. 
        There still IS some romance to finding and maintaining old
vehicles, but the world of old vehicle collectors and maintainers
is full of people buying and selling amongst each other. I really
wanted there to be an Aircooled Search And Rescue Team too. Oh well.

        Bill
