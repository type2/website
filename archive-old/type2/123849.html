Subject: Quick help needed with wipers

I thought I was in for a new wiper motor when my wipers started slowing down 
and finally stopped. Turned out all I had to do was lubricate shafts where 
they come through the body and all the joints on the mechanism. Works like 
new now!

John

&gt; I can't get my arms up under the dashboard to see if the 12v is making
it to the motor, but everything &quot;looks&quot; like it's good. Can a motor
just sieze up?
