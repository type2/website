Subject: [T2] child's cot

Listees,

Just wanted to let the list know that I have 3 child's cots for sale.  Two are for the 68 Westfalias (i.e. round black poles measuring 56 1/4 inches).  The other one is for 69-73 Westfalia (i.e. stamped galvanized poles measuring 56 1/4 inches).  Asking $60 each plus shipping OBO.

Also, I'm looking for a child's cot that will fit 74-75 Westfalia (i.e. solid stamped galvanized poles measuring 57 1/4 inches).  After purchasing 3 wrong child's cots, I think I've learned my lesson on determining that it's the correct one before sending money :-(
