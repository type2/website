Subject: 3 scoop m-code?

Not really unless there really was.  I drive 'em and leave the esoterica to 
the purists.  If you're a purist, don't read this!

Today was do stuff on the Burrit Express day.  I fixed the hold down strap 
for the Dormobile top that broke at Full Moon in Joon.  Used a chunk of 
leather from my 'distressed' jacket the puppy tried to eat.  Sewed it to the 
remainder of the broke strap and bolted it on in.  Ain't real British 
leather since the jacket was Hecho en Mexico but it'll do.  Replaced the tin 
pan vent cover with the reporo from Sue Dolvin.  It fitted well except the 
bolts to the prop were too far apart.  Nothing some silicone and a drill 
couldn't fix.

I've been pondering the oil cooler situation for a while and decided the 
remote will get it's own air supply.  I snagged a couple scoops from 
Snoopy's donorbus and stared at them for a month.  The time came when I 
decided to either do it or toss them.  Don't like tossing good material.  
Cut holes in my bus and stuck another scoop on.

The process can be roughly followed by going to

I'll run it like it is for now and watch the temperature to and from the 
Phish show this weekend.  I'll let you know how the extra scoop interacts 
with the cooling system.

&quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;
