but Muir's conclusions were based on what? I never saw a labratory
section in the idiots book :) I hadn't thought to bring in the extra
variable of non-detergent oils. The original question was simply a
brand change &amp; a quick skim through Muir doesn't say anything about
changing brand, just don't follow an engine that has been running
non-detergent oil w/ detergent oil.

Which makes me wonder, where can you get non-detergent oil from
anyway, nowadays? An old book of mine says that API letter SA &amp; CA are
the only classifications what have no detergents added. Anyone know?
