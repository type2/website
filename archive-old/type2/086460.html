Subject: Fw: [T2] '78 Deluxe Westy-$16000- Worth it?

The real question is again one of usage. If it is to be a driver or show
car.
If all of you were to sit down and do the math, and include your personal
labor as well as what you have invested in parts and professional mechanics,
you might find $16,000 is not so far out there.

&gt; &gt;I have a buddy who has located a '78 Deluxe Westy, Dakota Beige, 14500
&gt; &gt;miles, all original, no wear whatsoever, and is contemplating buying
&gt; &gt;it.  I have seen this vehicle and it is in almost showroom
&gt; &gt;condition.  However, the price is $16000 firm.  The camper has been kept
&gt; &gt;in a climate controlled garage and I have no doubt this is one of the
&gt; &gt;nicest campers in the US.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I feel $16000 is a really high price for something like this, even
&gt; &gt;considering the condition.  What is the consensus on something like
&gt; &gt;this?  Is he nuts to pay that much for it? He is really thinking about
&gt; &gt;forking over the cash for it, but I'm wondering if buying something in
&gt; &gt;lesser condition for $10000 less wouldn't be a better investment.

&gt; Have you ever seen one this nice for sale??? How much did they want??? If
&gt; it's not worth $16,000 to someone, it won't sell. If it is, it will. Any
&gt; original rubber on a 24 year old car can fail as soon as put back on the
&gt; road. If the brake fluid is black, you know issues will be there. If it's
&gt; clean, pay the price for such a rarity. You are likely never to see
another
&gt; 24 year old vehicle with evidence of adequate continuous maintenance since
&gt; new.
&gt;
&gt; Condition of the CV's can tell a tale. They are all date stamped. Are they
&gt; stamped a few months prior to the chassis date?? They're originals. Are
the
&gt; boots originals, and do they appear serviceable, no cracks, still supple,
&gt; not swollen??? BIG points for rarity again. The environment has been good
&gt; for the rubber.
&gt;
&gt; Regardless, when considering paying a premium for a premium vehicle, a
&gt; knowledgeable inspection is required. It wouldn't suprize me at all if
some
&gt; cash flush Yuppie didn't think 1/3 the price of a new Euro Westy would
suit
&gt; him just fine and buy it.
