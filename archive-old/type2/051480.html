I would guess that this is an LT35 or other VW LT. You did not say what
country you are in, but I guess maybe the US. The VW LTs were not imported
to the US, so you will not see many of them, just those that have strayed in
somehow. This is just a guess from you description.

Saw a bus yesterday.  Had a grill like a vanagon, but this wasn't like any
vanagon I'd ever seen before.  I dunno, maybe more boxy than a vanagon, if
that makes any sense.  Had a very low riding pop top, had all of the RV
fixture type stuff on driver's side. (Left side for you in GB)   Looked kind
of odd, everything on the bus was white, except for the black grill.  Met it
on the fly, but was on a two lane rd, and we both were travelling under 40.
Had to have been brand new, or freshly repainted, this thing was WHITE.
