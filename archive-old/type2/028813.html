&gt; I have new, original equipment German mirrors for $24.95 each.
&gt; They don't  rust out quickly as the Mexican ones do.
&gt;
&gt; I have had a set of these on my '71 for several years now and Ron's right.
&gt; No rust.  However the plastic beading between the glass and the metal is
&gt; cracking from the UV exposure.  I;ll have to find a replacement bead
&gt; material or simply silicone the glass into place.


A bead of silicone works well. The fact that you've had the mirrors for
several years without rust is what makes these German ones special - the
Mexican ones tend to start rusting within  months, _and_ the beading cracks
as well.
