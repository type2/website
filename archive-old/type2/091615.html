Subject: Re: [T2] Some painting thoughts

John,

While the Omni is less expensive than the Delstar, it also lasts half as
long, and you use twice as much as you would using the higher priced
paints.
It is basiclly a straight old enamel, in line with Dupont's Dulux.
Not a good UV resistant paint.
I use Omni to paint the beds of dump truck's, just to be able to get a
correct match for the PPG Concept ( high solids ) I applied to the
cabs--
It milks out in about a year--the cabs I get 6 --7 years out of the
paint.
( they are mostly all red which is terrible for color retention )

 The coverage was horrid.  Omni is half the price of the real Delstar.
