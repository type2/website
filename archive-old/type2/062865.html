When I was with netcom, I had a shell script that would take their message,
as well as some large uue's, and slam them back down their throat.  You know
you've done well when you mail from a different account, and get a message
&quot;this site temporily closed due to mail bombing.&quot;  Now THATS satisfaction!
I've considered doing the same with our new T1 at work...
