Subject: Re: [T2] Match any VW Color? 72 Westy color  L90D pastel white or L567 ivory?

Hi Volks,

The ivory color by the way is elfenbein.  I had the
lid from a VW spray can and wondered if Loews could
scan it and match the paint (the people at Home Depot
had told me how impossible this was).  Anyway, I found
a confident paint mixer at Loews who wasn't sure he
could scan it but would give it a try.  The result was
a quart of perfectly matching oil based paint for
about $4.  I told the Paint guy I was impressed.  He
said he was impressed as well because he wasn't sure
the gloss and lettering on the spray can cap would let
nim scan it correctly.  When I touch up small areas
with a brush, the color virtually disappears into the
original color (mine's a 1980 Westy).  Now if only I
can take that Loews formula and have them make me a
bunch of spray paint cans.

&gt; &gt;&gt; One more thing about the colors. You can really
&gt; tell Pastell White and
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ivory appart. Pastell White really IS white,
&gt; Ivory is much more yellow,
&gt; &gt;&gt; something like a newspaper that has been in the
&gt; sun too long.
