Subject: [T2] T2] Re: [VB] What's in your garage?

I'm willing to bet that the description below is very similar to alot of
bus owners:

&lt;snip&gt; small beer fridge, TV, stereo, computer, a small parts/projects work
table,
telescopes, a turntable and my 700+ LPs.
&lt;snip&gt;
'63 Sundial with completed first stage body work and base color, The tires
are on cradles which allow me to push the bus around to make more room to
work on a particular area. The engine is on a workbench, surrounded by my
MiG welder, air tools and a 5 HP compressor and a roll around Craftsman
tool
chest.
&lt;snip&gt;
the bus and the tools are out in the 12'x24' shop and covered parking/work
area with the
drill press, bench grinders, torch welder, anvil, big ass vise, bus doors,
windows and all the camper interior.
&lt;snip&gt;


I'm fortunate enough to have one of the SF houses where the garage is the
length of the house. Otherwise, the bus would still be in the same shape it
was last year.
My additions to the above list:
Table saw, various motorcycles parts, scattered camping equipment, posters
that my better half would be caught dead with (hey, it was art back in
college, I got older, my taste didn't) Spare engine, interior parts the the
bus that will be put in once I get through sound proofing it.

Next!
