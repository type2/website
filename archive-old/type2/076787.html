Subject: Re: [T2] weber carbs, fuel pump, etc.

Hi Keith,
I run the ICT 34's on a 1700 and they are great, though I wish they had
chokes for those first 5 minutes after start-up. I also run a Bugpack fuel
pump and I was told it puts around 5psi. I have a pressure regulator on the
line and keep it at 3.5psi. Seems to work for me.

&gt; Here goes.  I bought a bus (75) w/ a siezed 1800 in it.  It had dual
webers
&gt; (ict 34s) on it. They appear to be brand new.  So anyways. i bought a used
&gt; 2.0 L from my buddy to replace the 1.8  Put it in, put the webers on  it.
&gt; runs like a champ.  Heres what scares me.  I bought Bob Tomlinson's Weber
&gt; tech manual last week at a vw show.  Seems like a sweet book for those who
&gt; are considering a weber book.  In there he talks about the ICTs being
kinda
&gt; like bare-bones webers and doesn't have a lot of good things to say about
&gt; them. He says they're for 1.3,1.5,1.6 L uprights.  Is anyone running these
&gt; carbs on a pancake 2.0L and is this ok??? If so are there any special
&gt; adjustments i need to make???  I haven't syncronized these carbs yet and
&gt; plan to do so tommorrow,  they seem to run awesome in the little driving
&gt; i've done (still no sticker).  I haven't had it at real high rpms yet.
&gt; There was a lot of popping when i first popped 'm on there but adjusting
&gt; them took all of the popping away.  They seem to be fine.  Anyone have
&gt; useful experience?
&gt;
&gt; Part 2-  The fuel Pump.
&gt; I have a generic electronic in-line fuel pump hooked up now.  It has
nothing
&gt; written on it.  I have no idea what it is/ how much pressure it's putting
&gt; out.  I also do not have a pressure regulator hooked up yet.  I plan to
&gt; replace the pump w/ a rotory pump when i get the bread, but am wondering
if
&gt; this is cool for now.  The book says 3.5 to 4.0 psi, i have no clue what
i'm
&gt; pumping through now.  What are the consequences for pumping w/ too much
&gt; pressure if this is the case?.
&gt; thanx a bunch
&gt;
&gt; Increase the peace
&gt;
