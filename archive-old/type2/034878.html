Subject: Re: sliding door rust

Sorry it took so long to get this info out but I was watching the Redskins give up
a 13 point lead and then drowning my sorrows.

The name of the auto body shop is Dannys Automotive 4961 South 10th St Arlington
Va.
It is just off Colunbia Pike behind a 7-11 on a little dead end road. His phone
number is
703-671-2427.

I'm looking at my bill and it says installed customers right side rocker panel
with sliding rail for sliding door, repair major rust hole to accept rocker panel
and paint door and adjoining panels. total 532.00

If anyone wants more info about the guy (Danny) p-mail me

Sharon
