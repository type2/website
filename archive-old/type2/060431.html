Subject: gas stink

Stop - you're going to burn that bus down! Quit moving it until you fix
some stuff.

My '78 had a similar problem that would stay away as long as I did not fill
up past 1/2. Of course I travel alot so that wasn't an option. 

You must pull the gas tank and check the filler neck hose - the one that
leads from the gas cap to the tank. On my bus there is rubber joint beteen
the outer wall (gas cap) and a metal tube that leads to the tank then right
before it goes into the tank it goes through another rubbe tube section.
Gas really eats them up bad. I bought new rubber from RMMW. My vent tubes
were pretty rotten and literally decintergrated when I pulled the tank.
Really scared me. 

My brother in law's buddy drove a Westy that burst into flaes one day
becuase of this. He didn't notice the fire until the heat was felt on the
back of his neck. Burned a hole right into the pavement.

So if you like your life, fix this thing. If you don't like your bus and
want to chance this potential fire ball situation - give it to me :)

Take care and let me know if I can help.
