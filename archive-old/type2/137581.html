Subject: Re: [T2] Meditation on bus ownership

 &gt; 3. A bus is not inherently undependable as many people think they are.
 &gt; It's quite the reverse. Properly maintained and driven, there is no
 &gt; reason a bus should break down. Ever. The trick is to get a bus to that
 &gt; state of tune and keep it there. That's what is most important ...
 &gt;

I agree. The biggest problem I am having though is catching up with the 
last 30 years of lack of proper maintenance! There seems to be no end of 
items that have not been maintained or poorly/incorrectly maintained by the 
dreaded POs. The latest has been the leaky rear wheel cylinder that took 
hacking off 2 wheel nuts to get to.

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
