&gt;&gt;No, roughly 20k on 1 set, 15k on another set, and 55k on the latest set.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmmm.

I know what you're thinking, but really, none of those heads had evidence
of heat-related problems.  I removed them all for other reasons.

&gt;&gt;Come to think of it, the very first set of heads I had on the
&gt;&gt;bus experienced a catastrophic failure (exhaust valve snapped in two) but I
&gt;&gt;had the EGR *connected* when that happened.  Go figure?
&gt;
&gt;I guess. Your cooling fan was running as well, we can blame the fan if we
&gt;want to. 8) 

Yeah.  :)  I don't really think that EGR caused the valve to break and I
hope that nobody else thought so either.

&gt;It's impossible to prove this stuff, at least with obsolete
&gt;cars, all you can get is theory on the one hand and anecdotes on the other.
&gt;But we spend so much effort trying to run cooler, then somebody invents a
&gt;device that lowers combustion temps substantially AND reduces emissions AND
&gt;improves mileage, with no side effects, and everybody thinks it doesn't
&gt;matter if you disconnect it.

On the other hand, cars ran fine without it for many years before, the
plumbing is nightmarish, the filter costs a ridiculous amount of money, and
I don't even know if you can get the muffler with the EGR port on it
anymore - can you?  I like my bus a whole lot better without EGR, and to
anyone who will taunt me about increased emissions,  No I don't care enough
to put up with the expense and trouble of EGR which will decrease my
emissions to only 150x that of a modern car instead of 200x.  Not worth it,
sorry.  Some day when more important things are all taken care of I will
install a catalytic converter which will decrease emissions to maybe 5
times that of a modern car.  Now THAT's an improvement.

Wierd thing - an engine I recently acquired has an EGR fitting welded into
one of the heat exchanger pipes up near the head.  I've never seen that
before - has anyone else?  

&gt;But woe be unto him who doesn't have an engine compartment seal.

Burn them at the stake!  :)  There is such a wide range of &quot;beliefs&quot; on
this list it's a miracle we can get along at all.  I know I contribute to
that problem but I'm trying to improve.
