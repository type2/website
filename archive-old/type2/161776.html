Subject: RE: [T2] Wife's demands

 Subject: [T2] Wife's demands&gt; &gt; Since we are on the subject, I'm forced to
admit that my '68 single cab&gt; resto project has to go
- restore with Maaco&gt; quality,trick it with premium paint, 4&quot; lowering, mags,
funky engine etc. or go fully stock
I generally know from the outset which direction I want to go with a vehicle.
If the sc is a good resto candidate (body condition is everything, mechanical
is the fun stuff once the body and paint are done) then I might suggest trying
to trade for a running bay that you can play with.  Whatever you decide, I'd
hate to think of a bus person without a bus.
