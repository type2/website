&gt; I replaced the sending unit on my 77 westy with the use of dremel cutting

&gt; that 74. My sending unit was center front (by the back seat). I made a larger
&gt; hole then I wanted
&gt; bw

I don't know why everyone is cutting holes, it is tight but I have
swapped out senders doing nothing more than removing my air cleaner/AFM
assembly...remove fire wall and lay on top of engine comp working thru
access hatch...tiny fingers helps and some good German profanity helps but
not required.  first time took maybe two hours after that less than an
hour
