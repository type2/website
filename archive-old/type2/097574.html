Subject: Re: [T2] refirbishing EGR filter, One question

Hey David:

I found a good used EGR filter for my &quot;new&quot; Westfalia and I've been
considering how to &quot;refurb&quot; it.  I had considered cutting into the box
portion of the EGR with a Dremel cut-off wheel, filling the box with copper
wool, and then repairing the hole I made with a small section of sheet
metal, muffler putty and muffler bandage.  But your method has the advantage
of not making the EGR look like Frankenstein's monster.  I assume you cut
the scouring pad into long thin strips that could be inserted in the end of
the pipe and then pushed into the box with a pencil, dowel, or the like?

Subject: [T2] refirbishing EGR filter, One question


&gt; Hello list,
&gt;
&gt; I bought a used EGR filter recently and decided to
&gt; refirbish it. First, I unpluged the inside of both
&gt; pipes that lead from the box. I could easily blow
&gt; through it then. I then took some copper scouring pads
&gt; and pulled them apart. I used scisors to cut the light
&gt; copper &quot;chainmale&quot; into small enough sections to
&gt; insert in the filter. I put a total of 3 scouring pads
&gt; inside the filter. I can still blow through the filter
&gt; with ease but this brings me to my question. What is
&gt; to keep the small particles of the scouring pad from
&gt; being sucked into the engine? Will this pose a
&gt; problem?  I am going to use an air nozzle to blow
&gt; through the filter to try and remove any loose tiny
&gt; particles but is this somthing to be conserned about?
&gt; I plan to change my oil once a month obsessively. Will
&gt; this help? I just don't want to install somthing that
&gt; could considerly lower the life of my rebuild. Any
&gt; thoughts would be appreciated!
