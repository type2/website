Subject: 911 bus: the long story

Or how a wacky dream becomes reality... Of course, I didn't do the project
all by myself, but enrolled the help of various people, shops, and firms
along the way. I'll mention them in the text.

I got the engine and inspiration from Wm. Kennedy, a former vanagon
listmember who did the same 2.2 liter 911 conversion on an early vanagon,
hence proving that such a thing is possible. (Search 1994-96 vanagon
archives for his posts regarding the conversion.) He later upgraded to a
2.7 liter engine and again to a 3.0. I bought the 2.2 from him, as well as
an oil tank. Bill seems like a level-headed and rational person and that
perhaps, more than anything else, convinced me that committing my time and
money to such a project did not *necessarily* mean I was crossing the line
to insanity.

My bus is (or at least was?) fairly nice and with a properly rebuilt type4
engine it would have been comparable to busses I've seen go for $4,000+. It
was clear to me from the beginning that cutting up the bus for the
conversion had the potential to ruin it, especially if the work was done
sloppily. The 911 is a dry-sump engine which draws its oil from a separate
tank. Making room for the oil tank is the first big step of the conversion
after pulling the old engine and psychologically it's the hardest. And so
it was with a heavy heart that I rented a sawz-all (sp.?) and cut off the
air filter support bracket, then a large hole in the right battery tray,
and cut out most of the sheetmetal that was hiding the fuel filler hose and
conceiling the FI ECU.

When it comes to the transmission, one faces two choices: use a 915 tranny
(Porsche 5-speed) or use the VW tranny. The 915 option is undoubtedly the
better one, but budget constraints had me keep the VW one. Hence, instead
of changing the halfshafts, I needed a special flywheel. The custom
flywheel came from K.E.P., a Southern Californian company that makes engine
to tranny adapters. It's basically a VW flywheel for the '76+ 091
bellhousing (and 228mm clutch and pressure plate), but with the 6-bolt
pattern for the early 911 crankshaft. I also bought their stage I pressure
plate to help deal with the bigger torque.

Note: My bus is a '75 with the 215mm clutch found in '74 and '75 models
only, but KEP only makes adapters for either the 200mm clutch or the 228mm
clutch. I could have gone either way, but figuring that VW increased clutch
size as their engine gained power, I decided to go with the more expensive
228mm clutch and flywheel option. The &quot;228&quot; flywheel actually has the same
diameter as the &quot;200&quot; or the &quot;215&quot;, but it is thicker, hence does not fit
'75 and earlier bellhousings. Swapping bellhousings turned out to be very
easy, but with the different bellhousing, I also needed a different
starter. (Marginal note: although the 091 was also used on vanagons,
vanagon starters do not fit. Only '76-'79 starters will do.) Karl von
Salzen sent me the starter for free! (Thanks, Karl!)

After shortening the tranny driveshaft by about 1/2&quot; with an angle-grinder,
the engine was mated to the tranny. With the help of a friend, the
assembled drivetrain was put into place and the bellhousing attached to the
transmission carrier. The rear of the engine was supported by the
floorjack, while waiting for a custom rear crossbar.

The rear engine crossbar (actually a plate) was fabricated by Rick Babor
(Mangobus_at_aol_dot_com) in St. Louis, Missouri. I couldn't have completed the
project without his help: he's clever AND he knows how to weld, a required
combination you're unlikely to find just by browsing the Yellow Pages. He
also brought a friend along who happened to be an engineer and together we
came up with a design that is both solid (at least according to the
engineer and I do trust him) and easy to implement. Instead of trying to
follow the type4 crossbar model, we opted for a design similar to the way
the engine is supported in a 911, basically suspended from above. Rick took
the original Porsche crossbar and made it longer so as to span the bus's
engine bay. The ends of the crossbar rest on the stock Porsche rubber
mounts which, together with custom spacers, sit on the corner shelves (the
one just right of the left battery tray and the other just left of the
right battery tray). The spacers are necessary to keep the rubber mounts
&quot;floating&quot;. Pictures help: see

The engine was finally firmly attached in the engine bay, but not yet
running, about a short week before my family and I were to move from St.
Louis to Montreal. The bus came along, of course: it went onto a flatbed
trailer and was pulled with the U-Haul. We left a suburban house with a
carport and a small garage to live in a downtown apartment with no place
for large toys; I left behind a life as a graduate student with time but no
money to find a life with no time, but some money. With neither place nor
time to tinker, I decided to pay someone else to finish the job for me. I
took the bus to Yannick Galipeau, who lives an hour east of Montreal.
Yannick is a self-taught mechanic who just opened a shop dedicated to VW
busses. He's also a listmember of &quot;les wests d'laut bord d'la gate&quot;, the
French-language version of the type2 list, and that's how I knew him. I
told him he could do the work on a time-available basis, assuming a new
shop would have a lot of that. Unfortunately I assumed wrong and it wasn't
until 3 months later that he actually found some time to allocate to my
project. I took a few days off over the last month and drove out to work
with him on the bus.

With Yannick's help, we did the electrical work and installed fuel pump and
fuel lines. Yannick hooked up the accelerator cable, attached the exhaust
sytem, and hooked up the oil lines (a hydraulics shop made a new oil return
hose for us). Because the original air filter setup is too tall to fit in
the engine compartment, I bought a new K&amp;N air filter setup from Steven at
Stomski Racing (Jstomski_at_aol_dot_com). [Steven also provided me with various
used Porsche parts, such as the rubber motormounts --they normally cost
$100 each new!-- and the fuel pump. He's friendly, helpful, and thorough
and his prices are fair, although this is a relative concept, parts in the
Porsche world seem to be five times that of their VW equivalent, if not
more. I'm not sure I ever told Steven that his parts ended up as
transplants into a lower lifeform... :) ] Anyway, the K&amp;N system was a
straightforward installation.

Yesterday, finally, I worked on the ignition system, which requires a
CDIgnition. I got the one from Universal Corp. that was recommended by Bob
Hoover. After getting that hooked up, cleaning the points, finding TDC and
installing the distributor accordingly, and last but not least getting the
sparkplug wires hooked up in the correct firing order, the engine finally
came to life.

To finish, here's the cost to date. I'm not including shipping cost for
parts. Neither am I including Yannick's labor since this is work I farmed
out for lack of time, not ability. My own time spent wasn't labor, but
pleasure, hence is valued at $0.

1971 2.2 liter 911T engine:     $1,000   (November '95)
(expect to pay more, say from $1,500 for a used 2.2 up to $4,000 for a used 3.0)
oil tank                        $   50   (Nov. '95)
KEP flywheel                    $  290   (Nov. '96)
KEP 2000 lbs, 9&quot; pressure plate $  140   (&quot;    &quot;  )
VW clutch disk                  $   75   (&quot;    &quot;  )
used bellhousing                $   25
starter                         $    0
rubber motormounts and AN bolts $   50   (May '98)
fuel pump                       $   55   (May '98)
crossbar and spacers            $   70   (June '98)
(Rick should have charged me 4 times that! A metal worker from Calif who'd
done such a conversion before wanted $400 for his support plate.)
K&amp;N air filter kit              $  135   (Oct. '98)
oil return line                 $   75   (Oct. '98)

Grand Total so far is about $2,000. Forseeable estimated future expenses are for
a custom exhaust                $  250
heater boxes                    $  500
a Bosch distributor (used)      $  200 (tune-up parts for the stock Marelli
dizzy are no longer made)


This ended up being a long account, but I'd like to conclude by stressing
the fact that this was not a particularly difficult job. The required level
of technical skills is moderate: if you have learned to adjust your valves
and have helped a friend pull an engine, then you're ready. The more
difficult segments of the job can be farmed out, but you'll need time to
find the right person. Being a member of your local VW club can be a
considerable help. Time is a fairly good substitute for money, too: the
project can take a week and $10,000 (take your bus to Dieter Wanderer or
your vanagon to MSDS, for example) or take a year and cost less than
$2-3,000. Feel free to e-mail me with any questions
