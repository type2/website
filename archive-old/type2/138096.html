Subject: Re: GoWesty

I have had a few things done at GoWesty and have had only positive  
experiences.
they Serviced and got my Dometic Refrigerator going last summer.
Yesterday I drove down to Los Osos from the Bay Area and they put in a new  
propane tank and while they were at it replaced my alternator.
 
I think I agree that they are not the cheapest, but they certainly know all  
about every kind of late model VW bus.
 
I was sorely  tempted to buy a set of wheels and tyres there, they  have a 
special on 15 inch wheels with load range C tyres for $999 a set, but  insanity 
prevailed.
