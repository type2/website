Dear Rodney,

This problem was described by some helpful soul a month or so ago
(SAVE THE LOAFS!)
I just fixed this on my 78 Westy.
It's your vapor recovery line on the driver's side.
Above the aux. battery, behind the curved metal that is the bottom of your
spare tire wheelwell in the closet there is a place where two solid gas lines
are connected by a 2&quot; long piece of rubber gas line. Feel up there and find 
where the gas line comes down ouyt of the ventilation tower on the driver's 
side. Follow it with your hand. On my bus, I can just see the rubber hose if
I squat down and peek in the rear hatch, chin at or below bumper level, looking
as far up and back there as I can.

Replace that hose and you'll be fine. I used hose clamps just to be sure, 
although they're hard to tighten up there (I used a shorty screwdriver and 
cussed some).
 
Evidently when you fill up full, some gas gets out of there.

Good luck,
Surfer Bob
