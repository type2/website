Subject: Re: [T2] wanted: watercooled engine for 1973 Bay bus

Hello list,I just recieved an email from Vincent Molenaar regarding
diesels in VW Buses. It seems my memory has failed me, the diesel was
used in Vanagons (1980-on) and Bays in Brazil (1980-1985) and NOT in the
European Bays. The diesels were all watercooled, sorry about the
mis-information, Timo.
