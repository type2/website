Subject: Removing Drum Backplate

Thanks in advance.

'71, am replacing hand brake cable, wheel cylinder, and shoes. The hand 
brake cable seems to be permanently stuck in the backplate so I'm trying to 
remove the backplate in order to get the old hand brake cable off.

The wheel cylinder is off and the two 17's are off the bottom. Below the 17s 
is a thick pin and is the only thing holding the backplate on??  The Bentley 
shows it in the pic but doesn't give it's name or mention it in the 
backplate removal procedure.

I've WD40'd it really well and have tried a hammer and punch on it and it 
doesn't budge at all.  Are there any suggestions for getting either the 
backplate off or the hand brake cable off the backplate?

Thanks again,
Daniel
