  Is a '78 a &quot;good year&quot; for busses.  I am taking a ride to look at
it with her on Thurs.  Any insight would be appreciated...


Hey there Mike,

I'd just like to say &quot;buy it, buy it, buy it&quot; but that wouldn't be
fair :-)

I own a 78 (now a parts donor) and a 79, both westies. The 78 is
considered by some to be the best of the type4 engined baywindows,
because of the hydraulic lifter (no more routine valve adjustments)
2.0L motor. (If it still has the original motor). I like the interior
layout of the late model bays, too. The 71 westy is also considered a
good year (best of the 1600 motor buses, IMHO). If you know Vanagons,
you know the best years for them, and some things to look out for are
similiar. 

You didn't say where the bus is located, so I can't really say if the
price is fair, but up here in New England, that's seems to be the
going rate (give or take), for a rust free, good running motor,
decent condition late baywindow Westy. At that price the bus should
need no or very little work. It should be a complete &quot;driver&quot;.

Things to look out for:

Karl Bloss's Summary of VW Transporters
http://www.enter_dot_net/~bloss/vw/vwsumm.html

The Bus Depot's Westfalia Camper info and Buyer's Guide
http://busdepot_dot_com/campers.htm

For a Buyers checklist goto:

The 78 westies came with different equipment depending on if it's
either a deluxe or a standard model westy, so if things are missing
(childs cot, camping stool, etc.) then those facts (and the buses
overall condition) can be used to &quot;negotiate&quot; a final price. If you
have any other questions, feel free to pmail me. 

Hope this info helps,
