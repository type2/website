Subject: re, dash gauges

 Hi, I only got the tach,  from Canadian Tire because I figured I could 
cheap out on that. The other gauges I got from California Imports.  I'll 
include the links.

  The oil pressure gauge is an electronic one so that I only had to run 
a wire all the way to the front. The oil temperature gauge only goes up 
to 300 degrees. As this is the temperature of the oil, not the heads, 
300 degrees is good because I believe that anything over 230 degrees, or 
so, is too hot.On days of 40* C, on the highway, my engine only gets up 
225*F ( and the roads have a lot of long hills in B.C.)
  I like these gauges because they look good in the dash, are easy to 
read,simple to install and when I'm on a road trip I like to keep a 
constant lookout on how the engine is performing.
  Any wiring  that had to be done I ran the wires underneath the van 
using existing conduits wring harnesses or whatever was there to keep it 
neat and out of harms way.
  HAPPY CRUISING!

&gt; &gt; So far, I can't access their product listings and search for the same 
&gt; &gt; gauge you mentioned. I tried searching for similar generic gauges, and 
&gt; &gt; found one with an upper limit of 300 degrees.  I'd be happier with a 
&gt; &gt; top limit of 400 degrees, or at least 350.
