Subject: Re: [T2] valve adjust after rocker removal?

Dave and Roland,

If I am not mistaken, only the '75 transaxles have five ribs.  The 
74 transaxles have only three ribs but are geared identically and 
are interchangeable.  Had one of those sitting in my garage until 
just recently.

I know all the books say that the gear ratio change occurred in 
mid '73 but in my experience all '73 model year transaxles have 
had the 5.375 final drive and all of the '74s have had the 4.86.

The '72 - '73 transaxles are geared considerably lower in 1,2 and 
3 but only slightly lower in 4th.

Thus, my recommendation for your friend, Roland is to find a 
replacement transaxle from the following years in order of 
preference:  '75 (stronger case), '74, 72-73 (if he doesn't mind 
the lower ratios).  They will all interchange.

-David

&gt;
&gt;&gt;..... a friend is needing a replacement manual transmission for 
his '74.
&gt;&gt;What range of year model donor vans would be compatible with 
his? And if he
&gt;&gt;finds one at a wrecking yard, what are the the things you can do 
to evaluate
&gt;&gt;it, if any?
&gt;
&gt;The match is 73 1/2 to 75, count five ribs on the top of the case.
&gt;Drain it into a clean white bucket. If you find gear chunks,
&gt;( use a telescope magnet ) or if the gear oil looks like
&gt;metallic paint ( brass shine ), reject it. Metal fuzz on the drain
&gt;plug is normal.
