Subject: Texas shows???Oklahoma????

Hey all,
  As it turns out I am going to miss the Spring
Meet at Puyallup this year. I will have to be in
Texas.(Dang Military!!!) So I was wondering if
there were going to be any VW shows in Texas
during 24 April-6 May? I will be in Wichita
Falls, but will drive for a Show.
  Or even in Oklahoma?????
