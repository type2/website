Subject: Re: [T2] 1978, window crank failed

Weird, as I just did this today on my 68. Got a new regulator from BD 
and just popped it into the driver's side door by leveraging the window 
channel (forward part by the wing) outward with a small pry bar while 
quickly slipping the regulator in through the small gap I created 
between the interior and exterior sheet metal of the door. In my year, 
the toughest part is just up and left of the crank where the two sides 
of the door come together for a couple of inches. Don't forget to 
remove the bolt here. I accessed everything via the large interior gap 
under the interior door panel. The hardest part of everything was 
replacing the plastic sheeting (cut and glued) to the frame before 
reinstalling the panel. I did it with the window in by holding it in 
place all the way up with a large bar clamp. Took about 25 minutes all 
told.
  hope that helps.

&gt;    couple hours ago I wound down the drivers window and it wouldn't go
&gt; back up.  some investigation reveals it is obviously internal.
&gt;
&gt; Bentley isn't very informative but it looks like a PITA to fix
&gt;  so
&gt; anyone who has done this, how difficult??
&gt; is the driver side and passenger side the same (I have a pass side 
&gt; door)
&gt; if not are they avaliable.  &quot;Bus Depot&quot; new or &quot;BustedBus&quot; used?
&gt;
&gt; any help is appreciated, would you believe in 25+ years of owning buses
&gt; I've never had one of these fail.
&gt;
