&gt; Hello,
&gt; I am i the process of getting all the parts together to replace the
&gt; exhuast and heater boxes on my 78 Westy.
&gt; I am going to put on heater boxes from a 72-74. I have the boxes and the
&gt; exhaust new from the Bus Depot.
&gt; I went with VW boxes and the stainless muffler. I am wondering what else
&gt; I will need to complete the conversion.
&gt; I am also looking for some personel experience tips on how to do this.
&gt; Once again list thanks.

Bill:
To do a first class job, you need the front lower cylinder  tin from a 72-74
or better yet from a 79, the underneath covers for the cylinders, and the two
rear heat exchanger hangers (the right one of which also is the alternator
adjusting bracket)
Seems like one time I did it I just welded something onto the end of the
alternator bracket. The 72-74 right lower cylinder tin has a hole to transfer
some warmed cooling air back up to the carbs through the air cleaner. Your 78
has injection so obviously does not need the warm air for the carbs. The 79
piece is exactly what you need. If you find a 72-74 piece, you should weld up
the hole.
