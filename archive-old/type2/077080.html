Subject: [T2] South Carolina, local bus deposit

Hello all,

  Here in central South Carolina I know a man who has several split windo=
w and &quot;newer&quot; buses that he would sell or part out.  He is very upright a=
nd honest.  He also has a billion bugs.  If anyone is interested.  He tol=
d me it was fine to give folks his name and number.  =20

  This man has been collecting bugs, things, pick-ups, buses, basically w=
hatever VW put out.  For decades.  He rebuilds and restores.  Attends sho=
ws too.  You will not find a nicer or more knowledgeable fella.  When he =
works on anything he does it right and makes it perfect as humanly possib=
le.

  It rather amusing to be taken on a tour of his domain.  Some of the veh=
icles have been there so long they have trees growing through them!

  I hope I have not over-stepped my bounds by posting this information.  =
But he may have something that someone else cannot find!
