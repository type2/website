Subject: It's fixed!!  (was &quot;Help!!! My Bus Broke Down&quot;)

Thanks to all who replied.  The bus is fixed and back into the garage at
home.  I called the parts store and managed to pick up the clutch cable 10
minutes before they closed.  It was an hour and a half job but I spent half
the time trying to get the nut off the end of the cable.  I lost half my day
but I try to look on the bright side:  I now a little more about my bus then
I did this morning.
Thanks again,

Phillip Freund
