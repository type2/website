Subject: Re: Starting Problem
Date: Tue, 17 Nov 1998 21:47:54 -0600

&gt;Today I went out to start my 79 Westy, and when I turned the key, no
start. 
&gt;Nothing else out of the ordinary occurred to indicate that the starter
might
&gt;be bad, ie: the starter did not click, nor did the dash lights dim like it
was
&gt;trying to kick over the starter. 

David --
I had a similar thing happen on a recent long roadtrip.  No start, no
clicking, no unusual symptoms, all electrical stuff fine.  Remembering
recent list readings, I got underneath and gently (but firmly) tapped on
the starter several times with a hammer.  When I got back in and turned the
key, she fired right up.  Worth a try, I guess.
