Oh Boy, a tire thread!  :)

You will get a lot of opinions on this topic!  Here's mine:

Your '72 has a relatively fragile worm-and-peg steering box, so you want
to avoid any tire that would increase steering effort, namely wider
sections.

The stock size is 185R14C, the &quot;C&quot; indicating a &quot;commercial&quot; load rating.

You can also use 185R14 load range C or load range D.

Do not use plain 185R14 tires.  These are for passenger cars, and they
will be overloaded by a bus.  When in doubt, look at the &quot;maximum load&quot;
marked on the sidewall.  1514 pounds is the minimum for a bus.  Always
check this!

Do not use any tire with a section number (/75, /70, etc.) in the size.
You want the default 80% section height.

Be very careful of tire vendors.  They often do not care about the needs
of your VW and will simply try to sell you something off the shelf.  One
common ploy is to tell you that the 185R14 is &quot;superceded&quot; by the
195/75R14, which it isn't!  The &quot;experts&quot; at the tire store won't know as
much as you do by the time you finish this post!

That being said, you can find several good tires in the proper 185R14
size.  Bridgestone RD603Vs are available in 185R14 load range C or D at
all Firestone outlets and many others.  There is also a new Continental
Vanco 8 in 185R14C.  I use the Bridgestones and they are very good, but
not M+S rated.  The Continentals are apparently M+S rated.

Hope this helps.

George
