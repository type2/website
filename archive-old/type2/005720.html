Subject: Re: [T2] Side window stuck

Piece of cake.
Unbolt window and let glass sit on bottom of door.
Pull down the U channel weather strip from up top at the vent window.
Remove the phillips head screw in the U holding the top of the vent window in.
Remove the bolt at the bottom of the channel.
Pull vent window assembly out of door, pivoting out from top.
Raise assembly up about 6''.
Remove 2 bolts holding gear drive to door.
Window regulator falls out.
Takes about 8 minutes to R + R the regulator, including R + R the door panel.

&gt; John,
&gt; This was the hardest part for me as well.  Again, let me say that the
&gt; Bentley manual was right on for how to do this.
&gt; I was getting pissed for about an hour.  Just had to use a bit more
&gt; muscle.  A little grease wouldn't hurt.  I think I used a screwdriver to
&gt; push the window guide back (be sure not to push on the flimsy retaining
&gt; clip) with one hand, and worked the regulator cable piece down with the
&gt; other.  Once I got it started, I used both hand to yank it out.
&gt; Not much in that area to damage.
&gt; Good luck.

&gt; &gt;How did you got the dammed thing out of the door ??
&gt; It is stuck behind the window guide channel which I can't remove
&gt; (I have taken out the screw holding the channel)
