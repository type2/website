Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder rebuild questions (i forgot something!)

You said:
&gt;&gt;The neighborhood we live in gives us problems if they see a car
disabled. They threatened to have the van towed when I was replacing the
gas tank.&lt;&lt;

If possible!!! Kick their ass, those damn snobbish bourgeois with
their BMW and Mercedes. I cannot believe that people still  think like
that when they see a beautiful piece of art like a VW Westy.

Long live our old gas polluting smoking Bus (he he he)

Cheers, Ben
