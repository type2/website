Subject: Re: [T2] vehicle inspection on long island

&gt; Steve,
First of all Flushing is in Queens. I know it is on Long Island but it 
is a borough of NYC. So you can forget about towing anything and 
avoiding city traffic.
Second of all the NYC law about towing vehicles is pretty strict. So 
you must have a tow bar and brake lights for the rear of the Bus if you 
plan to tow it. OR you can have a licensed NYC towing outfit tow it 
past the reaches of the city.
I live not too far from there and would be happy to check it out if you 
aren't in a hurry ( I am out of town for two weeks).
Good Luck
