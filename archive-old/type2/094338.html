Subject: Re: [T2] Espar Gas Heaters, how many BTU's is enough? Group
	purchase?

The dealer installed South Wind heaters put out 20,000 BTU, are easy to work
on and install, can be purchased for under $200 at swap meets or from Ebay
and all tuneup parts are still being made!!

&gt; I am pretty sure the BA6 puts out 12,000 or 15,000 BTU's but
&gt; I was trying to decide if that was overkill for the van.
&gt; Which one should I get?
 
&gt; The B3LC costs $1945 CAD puts out 12,000 BTU's using .11 US
&gt; gallons per hour drawing 3.0 amps.
