Subject: Re: [T2] Wanted: Bus Towbar

Bob:
You are quite correct, the final drives are VERY different. The only parts that
are the same are the CV's and their bolts and possibly the flanges that they bolt
to.
I think it would be okay to tow an automatic intact IF you had the engine running
and in neutral. This would keep the bands, clutch packs and bearings lubricated.
I'd really want to have a remote oil lite in the towing vehicle. This might be
practical for a short tow, but for a longer time, it would seem to make more sense
to take out the axles. Let me tell you, though, taking out 24 CV joint bolts in
bad conditions in unfamiliar territory is no cuppa tea! (BTDT) It's quite another
thing with an impact and a lift! Of the 20 or so autos that I currently own
(counting parts cars), I think only 2 are automatics.

69 double cab, 79 Ford cube van, 75 chevy 4x4  (2 of these 3 are automatic- guess
which is my favorite!)

&gt;     The manual tranny is a one piece casting with a bolt on bell

&gt; final drive is interchangable.  even the half shafts are a different
&gt; length.
