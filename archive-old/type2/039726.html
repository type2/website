Subject: Re: The Ultimate! A Cupholder which doubles as an E-brake

I have a full roll of Duct tape on the floor for my cup holder. Just one
more thing to add to the long list of uses for duct tape.
But if you use it for anything else and the roll gets small...it kinda loses
it's usefulness as a cup holder.
