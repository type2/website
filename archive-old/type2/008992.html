78 VW bus for sale in SE CT - $1500 OBO.

Body in good condition - no holes - originally from 
west coast (only been east for 5 years - has sat covered 
for last year).  Currently not running appears to have a problem 
with FI - engine turns over.  Tranny rebuilt in 1994.  Comes
with tow bar.  Pictures available on request.
