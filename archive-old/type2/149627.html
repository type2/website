Subject: Re: [T2] oil cooler

Phil,
It sound like you have used these sandwich adapter plates. I'm curious about 
clearance for the hose fittings on the bus engine. Do you use a 90 degree 
fitting to point the hoses straight down? What do you consider as the best 
route to get the hoses to the cooler using one of these adapters?

Bus-ted minds want to know

&gt;   Tom CIP has the kit or you can
&gt; buy just the adaptor plate and build your own set up.
&gt; Getting the kit saves getting the runaround trying to
&gt; get all the parts and the cost is about the same, have
&gt; done it both ways. Phil
