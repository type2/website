Subject: Engine Problems after Tune Up Update 3

Well,

I finally got around today and bought the vacuum caps at my local FLAPS  on
plugged
the two inlets in the manifold. While I was doing that I decided to check
again all the joints
of the manifold and found one of the boots loose. I put it in the right
place and voil`, the
bus is back alive...  Thanks to all for your kind help. It surely would
have taken me way more
time to find the fault by myself... It's incredible the havoc a little
manifold leak can cause in your engine...

Since I was already in the engine compartment and it wasn't raining this
afternoon I decided to
change the fuel lines (and put clamps on them) and the in-line fuel filter
change, as well as clean the fuel
filters.... The problem now is that fuel is not getting to the carburetor.
Fuel is getting to the pump but is not
coming out of it. Do I have to prime the fuel pump in order for it to work?

Thanks in advance for your help. Regards,

Rogelio
