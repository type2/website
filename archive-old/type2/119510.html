Subject: Dead Battery

Ok,, twice now, great day for a drive in the Bus,, and it won't start!

The ambition blind sided me, I don't know where it came from,,  I could
have left that battery DEAD till spring.

But I found myself trouble shooting the problem, tools in my hands!

Ok, I had to step back and Think!

What do I normally tell people with a &quot;drain&quot; on the battery?
Check the radio,,
Check the interior light,
is the fridge on?...
It is usually the last thing you installed.... that is the radio in this
case..

hmmm,,
Charged the battery.

I took off the neg battery cable, and put a test light between it and ground.
The lamp light, dim and pulsing,,, strange...

Ok,, time to pull the fuses,, one at a time
then the light went out!

Ah, circuit #9... the diagram says key buzzer and rear dome light.

Then I discovered that *I* had installed radio memory preset to circuit #9
which became radio positive when I robbed the relay this summer.

I disconnected the radio, and no more battery drain!

Seems like something isn't right,, It is a Toyota CD player.. simple
stuff, power , ground, and speakers
There is no preset memory connection.... or auto ant. or anything,,,, but
it is drawing about 0.080 amps in the off position.


Soon, I will get another relay to put back where I removed it from this
summer then that radio will be OFF when the key is not in the ignition!

I might have to ask for a CD player for christmas! :-)
