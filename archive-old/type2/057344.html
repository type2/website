Subject: Bob Hoover

I would like to add my voice to those who are saddened by Bob Hoover's
decision to take his sermons offline. Although Bob clearly has the right to
do what he wants with his own information, I too will miss the ability to
access his wisdom through the web.

For those whose selfish and boorish actions brought about this decision on
Bob's part, I hope you more carefully consider what you post in the future.
If you wouldn't say it in person, if you might regret saying it tomorrow or
next week or next ..., if you're angry, maybe you shouldn't post. Calm
down, think it through.... Be part of the solution, not part of the problem.

I began reading this list (actually, its grandfather) just as Bob was
posting the Grendel saga. It was largely his account of his struggles to
get that bus going that inspired me to have the confidence to own and take
care of our bus. I hope that his honest, blunt, persistent, expert,
careful, concerned, systematic, and prudent-risk-taking spirit continues in
the advice and attitudes of those on this list.

I regret that those of us (and I definitely include myself in this
category) who appreciated Bob's invaluable contributions did not do a
better job of supporting Bob before it came to this.

As this list and its ancillaries are so valuable, it amazes me that anyone
would do anything to reduce that value.

Sadly,
