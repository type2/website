Subject: tire covers

This seems so simple, yet I guess I have failed to look in the right areas.
I want a tire cover that has the VW logo on it for my spare (on nose of my
75 westy).  I could have it custom made, but there has to be a cheaper
alternative.  Any suggestions of sources (prefer online resource)?  Thanks
