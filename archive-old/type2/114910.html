Subject: Re: [T2] firing sequene cj/cu ingene/valves

Sabro,

Hi and welcome to the list. Not to worry about your pronunciation or spelling, we'll figure you out!


&gt;can anybody tell me if de sequens of ignition of the &gt;cylinders with a cu ingene is the same as a cj 2 &gt;liter ingene,

Both air-cooled right? 1-4-3-2

&gt;the cu ingene i gonna build in 
&gt;next week has hydralic lifters thus this mean i &gt;don,t need to adjust the valve clearens?

You should adjust them per the bently at first, ask the list for the procedure if you don't have it. Check the type2_dot_com library too.

You can leave them alone pretty much after that.
(flame suit on!)
 
&gt;thanx and greetings from a stormy rainy amsterdam

you're welcome Sabro, Amsterdam, mmmmmmmmmmmmm

later,

Billy
Visalia, California, USA
