Subject: RE: [T2] standard ECU in an automatic bus?

&gt;Greetings all, what are the consequeces of using an ECU from a bus with
&gt;standard transmission on a bus with automatic transmission? 

I liked Karl's answer to the question about auto ECUs verses manual ECUs
because I run a complete 78 federal-standard-FI system on my 76 automatic
bus.  I tried a couple of different years of ECUs and couldn't tell a
difference, but I have never tried an ECU from an auto bus.  My bus had dual
Dellortos, but I replaced those with the 78 system that I purchased complete
for $35 (what a deal).  

&gt; Will an ECU
&gt;from a 76 FI bus work with the rest of FI components from a 78 FI bus?  

I'm not certain, but you definitely need to research this more.  I think
(which means I'm not certain, but I'm relatively sure) that the 75 and 76
fuel injection systems had a switch on the thottle body that triggered full
rich, all out, petro squirting, flame thowing, tires squealing, FULL
THROTTLE AHEAD.  This switch had a little roller on it and the throttle
linkage would actually depress this switch when the gas pedal was pressed
all the way to the floor.  The switch had a wire(s) that ran to the ECU that
would tell the ECU that you really meant business and you wanted to go like
a bat out of hell.  I'm positive the 78 system does NOT have this switch.
In 78 the ECU calculates and adjusts the injectors for full rich by some
method without the throttle switch.  I think this switch was dropped
beginning in 77.  In your case, you have an ECU from 76 that needs a wire
from the trottle switch, but you have a 78 throttle and wiring harness that
does not have what the 76 ECU wants.  To make a long story short....it won't
work.  It may run, it may not.  I don't know.  I don't think it will run
correctly even if it runs at all and I'm relatively certain you will never
get all that flame throwing and tire squealing full throttle action that I
know you gotta have.  Many parts of the 75-up FI systems are identical and
interchangeable, but I think you will have a problem this particular item.
Good luck.
