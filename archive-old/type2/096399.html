Subject: Re: [T2] timing question

The distributor reference page is great!  This morning I pulled out my
flashlight and dentist mirror and got my dizzy model #: 0237 022 025.

According to the chart, this is a distributor for a &quot;Vanagon 1983-1984 *
1900 Digijet&quot;.  It is supposed to be timed at 5ATDC.  Is this the wrong
part for my '79 CA bus?  Is that why I had to monkey with the timing to
get it to run decently at all?

&gt; My question is: why is 7.5deg BTDC best for my vehicle?  Bentley and the
&gt; sticker on the engine compartment lid both say 5ATDC...  Sure enough, the
&gt; bus runs great at 7.5.  How is anyone without a gas analyzer supposed to
&gt; know what timing setting is best?  I always thought I'd be fine if I went
&gt; by the book.  Also, is this likely to change ever?  Can I always set the
&gt; timing at 7.5BTDC from now on?

&gt; I figure you already know this info from the URL above: the federal
&gt; and CA models seem to have different timing settings for 1979.
&gt;
&gt; The answer to your question may reveal itself if you identify for
&gt; ignition parts by number and determine if you have a federal parts in
&gt; your CA bus.
