&gt; Can someone check my calculations?
&gt;
&gt; Situation:
&gt; Stock '79 Westy,
&gt;
&gt; Stock 2.0L engine.  Brand new AMC heads/valves.  Using a buret, I
&gt; accurately measured head volume at 57.5cc.

That's in the ballpark of heads I've measured.

&gt; Using a depth gauge and
&gt; micrometer, I measured/calculated compressed volume inside cylinder
&gt; (not head) at 28.06cc.

Not sure is that figure was taken with or without the 1.14mm shim.  But,
assuming it was figured with the shim in place, that seems awfully large.
That works out to a deck height of about .160&quot;, which is way larger than
anything I've encounterd.

&gt; Not knowing the volume of the piston dish, I
&gt; calculated the volume of the dish to be 15.58cc from diameter and depth
&gt; (6mm) measurements. (Does anyone know the quoted volume for the piston
&gt; dish? )

I've heard various figures in the 14cc - 15cc range.  I've must admit I've
never accurately measured an actual dish, though I should have, but have
used 15cc in my various calcs.


&gt; I measured the stroke to be 70.75 mm.  I measured the bore to
&gt; be 93.97 mm.  I measured the shim at the base of the cylinder to be
&gt; 1.14mm.  NO HEAD GASKET/SHIM.

I must admit I've always used the &quot;stock&quot; figures for bore and stroke
because I have no way to accurately measure stroke.


&gt; From my calculations, I get the
&gt; following values:
&gt; Cylinder and head uncompressed volume (total volume):  576.24cc

Head      57.50
Deck      28.06 (assumed barrell shim in place)
Dish       15.58
Swept 492.726  (stock figures)
          ---------
          593.866

&gt; Cylinder and head compressed volume:  85.56cc

Head      57.50
Deck      28.06 (assumed barrell shim in place)
Dish       15.58
           --------
            101.14

&gt; Compression ratio: 6.73 : 1

593.866/101.14 = 5.87

&gt; This CR seems a little low to me.  Would this be adequate for a stock
&gt; bus?   Do I need to flycut the heads?


That deck height just seems too large.
