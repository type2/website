SHUT THE ENGINE OFF NOW!!!!!!!!!

&gt; The bad news is that the tranny dipstick is dry, and the torque

running a torque convertor or auto tranny while dry is to assure
destruction!!!!!

&gt; first 1.5 quarts of ATF I could lay hands on into it but it's still 

DEXTRON ONLY!

&gt; very loud. ( The fact that the P.O. had lots of empty ATF cans in the 
&gt; bus should not be ignored). I have already observed steady dripping 
&gt; from the torque converter when the engine is running.

remember it is only 400cc between the low and full marks and to check an
auto tranny with engine runnning, hold brake shift from
P-R-N-D-2-1-2-D-N-R-P  stopping for a few seconds in each position, then
put in N, check dip stick at this point

&gt; Not having fully read the Bentley's auto tranny chapter yet, are there 
&gt; any  specific items I should be looking out for??  Frankly, the 
&gt; illustrations in that chapter scare the &amp;^%$ out of me.

FILL THE TRANNY!!!!!!

ignore the tranny illustration, it is designed to scare the *&amp;_at_# out of
you.  read the rest, ignore the rebuild section
