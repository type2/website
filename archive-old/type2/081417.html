Subject: Re: [T2] More Corvair Bus Troubles W.V. (Transmission)

The belt broke and the battery went dead at the same time it overheated
since the alternator wasn't running, get it?  It was 3am and I had to leave
it there and was not able to fully ascertain what was going on.

&gt; &gt; the engine going again.  I had thought it siezed but it did not - the
&gt; &gt; battery just went dead.  Good thing it was night and I had the
&gt;
&gt; Ummm... Glen, if you mistook a dead battery for a seized engine, maybe you
&gt; aren't the guy to deal with a Corvair conversion. I know I wouldn't
attempt
&gt; such a task. Even thouhg my father's first new car was a Corvair and I'd
&gt; have more help than I wanted, there's a reason you don't see many of these
&gt; on the road.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; headlights on or it would have toasted it before the battery died.
&gt;
&gt; Hmmmm... If the battery is dead and the engine is running - except for
&gt; smelling weird stuff from the battery, there is no way to tell. If your
&gt; headlights were dimming as you drove then your battery is fine. You need
to
&gt; check your generator/alternator/whatever GM put on the Nadermobile...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; has acted up.  It is stuck in 1st and the shifter moves into 1, 3, and
&gt; &gt; neutral but it stays in first no matter what, unless I push the clutch
&gt;
&gt; Linkage! Linkage! Linkage! you've got at least four feet more linkage in
the
&gt; bus than the Corvair originally had - and even then any linkage can suffer
&gt; bigtime from minor problems. New bushings, adjusting the linkage, etc,
will
&gt; probably fix all your problems.
