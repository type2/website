Subject: Is new fuel line the right stuff?

Ordered some new fuel line for my 80 Westy. It's supposed to be the high
pressure fuel injected stuff. Its been years since I've seen the original
looking externally braided stuff so I'm not remembering what this should look
like. The markings on the hose are &quot;COHLINE 21220600-22-5X12.5-NBR-25/03 DIN
73379-B&quot; I cant be sure all the numbers are correct, it's hard to read this
stuff printed on the cloth braid. Measured the inside diameter and compared to
some internally re-enforced line I got for my 75 a while ago, same
dimensions.

Does anyone have experience with this brand or part number? Is this the right
stuff? Any tips on keeping the braid from fraying? Thinking about a touch of
clear fingernail polish.

Every day on my way home from work I see what was a beautiful Dark Blue Super
Beatle. Now its two tone; dark blue and soot black. The leaking fuel hose
strikes again! I don't want this paint scheme for my Westy.

I got the hose from one of the most reputable parts dealer on the list, So
it's probly the right stuff but I am cautious.

Tom
