For once, I disagree with you, David. This is my intuition:  An oil that
transfers more heat also &quot;pumps&quot; more heat out of the engine, hence leaves
the engine cooler overall. If the engine is cooler, so is the oil in the
sump. Hence the seeming paradox that an oil that absorbs more heat should
in fact be cooler. I think I'll give this Kendall stuff a try.
