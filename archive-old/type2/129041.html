Subject: Re: [T2] Stripped Spark Plug Hole on 1.8

  &gt;&gt;...When I was finish I checked the inside of the cylinder i'd
&gt;&gt;repaired for any metal files. Using a magnet I was able to remove the
&gt;&gt;few that didn't get blow out. 
&gt; 
Then George said:
&gt; Glad the repair worked out for you!
&gt; BTW, where did you find that aluminum magnet?  :)

Oops had a memory hick-up, I'd remembered using a magnet but i forgot 
that it didn't work :) doh. What I did use was the vacuum again. Here is 
what I did. First I attached a bendable drinking straw to the vacuum 
tube using duct tape to seal the tube to the straw. With the vacuum tube 
stuck into the vacuum &quot;suck&quot; port :) i stuck the straw down into the 
spark plug hole and vacuumed away till it was all clean. I also vaguely 
remember using the eraser on the end of pencil too, that and a flexible 
metal rod with some tape to help clean anything the vacuum missed.
Hope that helps

Alex
