Subject: Gel Battery

Hi,

I have a 1972 VW Camper with a 1979 Interior.  I Have a dual batter setup, with a starting battery from volkswagen, and a cheap deep cycle battery.  Both batteries are getting weak.  I am considering replacing them with Optima batteries.  

Will Optima batteries fit, if so which model?  

Can I put a Optima Starting and Deep Cycle in parallel? Will they charge ok? I have battery relay in there now, so the starting battery won't be drained when camping.

I checked the archives, so I am sorry if this question has been asked before.  Any advice would be appreciated.
