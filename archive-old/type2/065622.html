Subject: Re: It's too hot in here

&gt;         I am worried about how much heat I am getting from the engine.  The
&gt; heating tube at the front of the van under the dash gets very hot and the
&gt; lino on the floor by the rear heat duct has turned brown as if it is burnt.
&gt;         Am I supposed to get this much heat?  I have noticed the engine is
&gt; still warm an hour after driving.

Just say a little prayer of thanksgiving and be happy you have _ANY_ 
heat!  :)

I think this is the first time I've heard of someone having a bus 
that's too hot!  My '57 does NOT fall into that category--even with 
Mr. Heater (propane) running!
