Subject: Broke down travelling artist in SC

hello all,

Our good friend and fellow bus brother is stranded just south of columbia in
Orangeburg, SC. Sounds to us like he may have blown the motor trying to get
back to florida. We are going to pick him up, and take him to our house in
the Charlotte area to pick up another motor, but he needs a safe VW friendly
parking place. The hotel he is at, doesnt seem all to pleased to have a
painted up 67 broken down unattended. Plus, hes understandably worried about
leaving his &quot;other half&quot; all alone and vunerable.

I will be in contact with him today, if someone could call me here and let
me know if you can bus-sit for a day until we can do the motor grab and
switch, that would be AWSOME!

fellow Volkswoman, wife of BRM,
passat drivin' (yes I'm water spoiled )
