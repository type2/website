Yeah, you'll either need a wb02 or a exhaust gas analyzer.  If you go to 
a smog shop (I'm assuming you live in a state that does smog), they can 
look at the values of where a bus is supposed to be (preferably at load) 
and then adjust.  Then after that's dialed in, adjust the idle screw.

Or, if you get a WB02 sensor, you can adjust it yourself.  I have to 
say, a wb02 is one of the handiest tools ever.  If you have a laptop, 
pick up the LC-1 from innovate motorsports.  It makes tuning your car so 
much easier as you can instantly see the state of your engine.

NBo2 sensors won't tell you anything useful unless you have an ECU that 
can make use of it..
