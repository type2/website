Richard's advice might make sense if the next GEX &quot;event&quot; were a 
decisive, catastrophic failure. But there's a chance that you'll have 
low compression on one side or the other. It might be rings. It might 
be valves. Or you might develop a leak in the oil cooler. If you fix 
each of these each time they pop up, you'll spend a fortune maintaining 
this engine and still never have anything dependable.
