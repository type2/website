Hello all,  I need to get some things straight.  I have a 1971 AD twin port
engine in my
bus and am about to get stuck-in to some overheating prevention.  As I
understand it,
the two flexible hoses from the fan housing to the floor of the engine bay
are purely
to pass air through the heat exchangers and into the cab, as such they play a
relatively small role in cooling the engine.  The longer hose on the right
confuses me a little, is this regulated by the thermostat? letting warm air
back around when engine is cold?  If this is the case then the largest volume
of fan air must be blown under the engine into the space around it created
by the lower tinware. Is there a designated outlet for all this cooling air?

o.k so imagine now that you unclamped one of the two similar hoses from its
position
on the floor of the engine bay.  If you were to look down this short pipe,
you are
basically staring into the small box that is fixed to the muffler, exhaust gas
flows
through here yes? When I look down that short pipe I can see a small tube
coming
from the engine and terminating (open ended) inside the small box.  Doesnt
this mean that exhaust gas is then mixing freely with the air that is then
blown through the heat exchanger? instead of being taken directly into the
muffler. Should the small tube from the engine continue towards and seal to
the muffler? thus allowing the air intended for my the cab to blow around the
tube and on into the heat exchanger.  

This is worrying me, big time.  The small box that we are collectively
looking
downwards into is also completely loose, held in place only by the now removed
hose
and its position relative to other bits of tinware.  I cant use the heating
for fumes and
had assumed a heat exchanger had corroded but this seems a more likely cause.
Both small boxes at either end of the muffler are in the same condition.  

So, am I completely wrong about general air flow? 
     should the muffler and small boxes be a one piece unit?
       will I make it to work today with the window closed?

thanks for sitting through this,  all help much appreciated.  Adam
