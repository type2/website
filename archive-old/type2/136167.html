Subject: '71 &quot;Clunk&quot; in steering

I'm starting to hear a &quot;clunk&quot; when my Bus's steering wheel is turned hard to
the left.  The sound occurs only when lots of effort is required to turn the
wheel *and* it's been turned far to the right prior to being turned to the
left -- e.g. when parallel-parking in a very tight spot.

This problem manifested itself immediately prior to my departure on the 1,200+
mile return trip from L.A. to Blaine, WA.  I had someone turn the wheel back
and forth with me laying down under the Bus.  It didn't look like any of the
various arms, tie-rods, linkages, etc were even slightly loose.  The sound
seemed to be coming from something concealed way up front, right near where
the steering column reaches the floor.

Is there a common wear item somewhere in there that's likely to need
replacing?  Can it be repaired by a mere mortal?  The problem is clearly in
its infancy, and it doesn't seem likely to get anyone killed anytime soon.
I'd like to understand it and repair it long before that becomes a
possibility.

Any and all pointers welcome.

Many thanks,

- Miles
