Well, I was starting on the camper this morning (my first real look at it),
and I noticed that most of the wiring in the engine compartment was
spliced, frayed, or not connected at all. While contemplating what it will
take to rewire everything, I started wondering whether all the fuel
injectors were wired properly at least. 

Then something struck me: no fuel injectors! Just 2 carbs. What? Then it
occured to me to check the VIN to see what year it actually is. Serves me
right to take the PO's word for it. I am the proud owner of a 1972 camper
van. 

Looking at this wiring diagram... I have quite a fun time ahead of me!
