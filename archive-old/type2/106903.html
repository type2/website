Subject: VDO Gauge Pod

Greetings List -

So, I found some quite decent VDO Oil Temp, Oil Pressure, and Volt gauges at 
the boneyard. Oh, and I found a glovebox lid that was in really nice 
condition.

$2.50/ea for the VDOs
$1.50 for the glovebox lid

A 2&quot; holesaw and a little elbow grease later:

Check out the (no duh..) VDO pics. The wiring harness goes out the standard 
cutout for the glovebox hinge. I was surprised at how much schtuff still fit 
in the glovebox, too.

Mike &amp; Itch
