Subject: Re: [T2] Quality Bus clip drawings

&gt;&gt; Sorry for this marginal content, but does anyone know
&gt;&gt; where I can find some good line drawings of VW buses
&gt;&gt; online? I am working on a t-shirt design for a local
&gt;&gt; bus event and I need some good drawings.

Here's the space station:

BTW, I'd be willing to buy a six-pack of quality brew for any artistically
inclined folks who would be interested in drawing a bunch of busses (all
years) that can be copy-lefted. I guess we'd have to avoid putting the 'VW'
symbol on the busses. I'm thinking of a collection of line drawings, pencil or
what have you. Both realistic and stylized. Colored and not (try to make the
lines solid, though, so those of use lacking in Photoshop skills can use
paintbucket fills to color!
