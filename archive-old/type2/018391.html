Subject: Pacesetter Extractor?
Message-ID: &lt;375BEEBB.8F524649_at_harmon.bml_dot_usouthal_dot_edu&gt;

      Anyone have any input on the Pacesetter Extractor that Bus Depot
sells? I can't see what it looks like - is it the same form as the other
extractor he sells?? That is, standard extractor, not like the two
muffler extractor piece of junk I got from RMMW that is now failing for
the second time??
     I've heard good reports on S&amp; S extractors, but no prices, and
their web page is not informative and they don't answer email very
quickly.
