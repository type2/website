&gt; I do not trust the filed &quot;v's&quot; on my pulley and the paint marks are gone.
&gt; Can someone tell me how I'd go about finding TDC assuming the pulley has
NO
&gt; markings on it whatsoever.  I want to find tdc and file a notch at zero,
&gt; then file another at 7.5btdc.


Remove either valve cover. Turn the engine in the direction of rotation.
Make SURE it is in the direction of rotation! Watch the rocker arms move on
the forward cylinder of either side. As you turn the engine you will see the
exhaust open [front rocker], exhaust close, intake immediately open, intake
close, then for a long time neither move. Keep turning til the exhaust opens
again. Just as it closes, STOP. At this point the intake should just start
to move. You want both rocker arms to be at a neutral point. Now go look at
you timing mark. That is zero, top dead center.
