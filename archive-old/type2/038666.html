Subject: Re: EFI sputtering

&gt; Problem with 77 Westy with EFI...
&gt; After driving down the highway for about the 20 minutes my engine starts
&gt; sputtering eventually cuts out.

Fuel Filter.

If I wait 10 minutes or so it will run fine,
&gt; but in maybe another 10 minutes it sputters and eventually dies an ugly
&gt; death.

Fuel Filter.

It starts subtly with a few misses and gets more and more harsh. Kind
&gt; of like running out of gas.

Fuel Filter.

&gt;
&gt; The amount of time the engine runs is directly proportional to the amount
of
&gt; ride time I get until the sputtering starts.

Fuel Filter.

Any ideas?

Nope.

&gt; PS My tire guys happily swapped out the light truck tyres he installed for
&gt; some C rated cooper tires, he has not installed them yet, but I appreciate
&gt; all of the advice.
&gt;

Hurray!!
