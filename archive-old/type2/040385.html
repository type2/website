Hi Bob...

Sorry to hear about the fire, but at least you saved the bus!

I redid the harness in a couple bugs, but never a bus.  One, like yours, was 
a meltdown.  The worst part was that the melted insulation melted all over 
where the wires ran, and not only made pulling out the old wires nearlty 
impossible, but made rerunning the new wires in almost as bad!

The way I did them (both) was to hook a length of thin (3/16&quot;) nylon line to 
one of the wires, and pull it through, like a chaser so when I pulled the old 
wire, I had a &quot;snake&quot; to repull the new wires.  I wrapped the &quot;motor and 
signal&quot; end around and around like a mummy, wrapped all that in tape so it 
was smooth, and *gently* pulled it back through the channel.  The firecase 
bug was the worst, because the insulation kept catching the tape and rope and 
wires, so I'd have to back it out and start over again.  The main thing is be 
gentle, take your time, and realize this could take up the better part of a 
day.  You *don't* want to lose the line - trying to retrace the original 
channel, at least on the bugs, is a holy nightmare according to a friend who 
did hers the &quot;hard way&quot; and almost sold her car over it.

I got the line at a hiking goods store (REI or somesuch).  It also worked 
good as a tiedown for the top of the bus!
