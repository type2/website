Subject: [T2] interchange (66) vintage

I have the 66 that I'm gonna go start on this weekend.  First question is 
this.  I am going to use a later model motor a 1300 from a bug year 72.  I 
know this motor will bolt right in but the starter and flywheel are 6 volt.  
Will the 6 volt pressure plate and clutch kit mount up to the newer case?  I 
am still up in arms about keeping it 6 volt or converting so any feedback pro 
or con would be appreciated.  I need to get this bus on the road and then 
pass a German inspection so it will be a few months.  But it will be all 
worthwhile.  Also any more info on the sliding door would be appreciated.  
Not much info on parts or accessories that I've seen.
PEACE OUT
Rick
