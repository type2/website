&gt; &gt; Yokohama 185R14D tires with a heavy layer of dust on them.  $78 each and

Yep.

&gt;BUT get these puppies on the pebbles, and you might as well get out and
&gt;walk.  Gravel, sand, mud, wet grass, loose dirt...they SUCK.  I'd had to
&gt;adjust my road-choice preferences...

Doh.

&gt;DONT get the 356 if you like off-pavement travel more them on-pavement
&gt;travel. I carry my comealong these days..

Hmmm... well the archives agree with you - I saw a couple of references to 
it being a highway tread pattern.  Which might not be so terrible if it 
wasn't also so small!  Or maybe it would.

&gt;If the Trailhandler has adequate load specs (is a C enough for that
&gt;highroof? but I know that finding a AT tire in D is near impossible now
&gt;that the 370 is gone....) I'd go for it.

The BFGs were load range C, but they were large and extremely heavy duty 
tires.  Compared to the Yoko 356Ds they are like an F150 vs. a Toyota 
Tacoma.  :)  Okay, I'm now leaning heavily towards the Trailhandler 
27x8.5x14s.  Someone stop me!  Gotta call them soon.
