For any of you who have read of, but not found your FI idle adjustment
screw, I have put a picture (with circles and arrows, but no paragraph on
the back) at:

This will be incorporated into a parts locator page at a later date.
Jarrett Kupcinski volunteered and is attempting to HTMLize the first
of my overexposures as we speak :-)  Thank you Jarrett!
