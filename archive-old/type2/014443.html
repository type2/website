Subject: manuals?  &amp; whose parts catalogs to order

Hello everyone,

I am going to pick up my 71 hardtop Westie on Saturday
in Dallas; I am REALLY excited!  In anticipation, I
wondered whether a) anyone had a Bentley &amp;/or Haynes
manual they'd part with for a reasonable amount before
I order them through the bookstore, and b) whose
catalogs I should order to flip through.

I have contacted BustedBus and found that their
catalog is avilable online; they seem like nice folks.
 

I believe I will be needing rear wheel cylinders and
brake shoes, some front steering linkage bits (ball
joints etc...), and aftermarket gauges in the near
future.  

Thanks!

Chris
