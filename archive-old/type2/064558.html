Gentlefolk,

You must remember how power brakes work.  As you press on the brake pedal,
you are, in addition to pushing the piston into the master cylinder
directly, opening a valve that lets the engine suck some air out of one
side of the chamber in the booster.  The normal air pressure on the other
side of the the chamber moves a  diaphram attached to piston pushrod that
then assists you in pushing that piston into the master cylinder and adds
the energy of the whole (well, OK, I'm exagerating a bit, but it *is*
Friday) atmosphere to your braking effort.   It is a sort of deliberate
vacuum leak.  If there are any holes in the diaphram, that is an
additional vacuum leak beyond the design.  Your booster will still work,
albeit less well, but as you push on the brakes you will have a
*significant* effect on your air fuel mix.

One guage I seldom hear mentioned on this list, that I think of as being
more than a little important, is the ol' vacuum guage.  To check your
brake booster, you would want to hook the vacuum guage into the intake air
circuit somewhere near the intake manifold. There are a number of things
that the guage reading will immediately tell you, but for now, let's stick
to the power brake booster.  When you step on the brakes the vac should
drop momentarily, but come right back up.  If it goes down and stays down
'til you let off the brakes, start looking for a new booster, as yours is
leaking.
