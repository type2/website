&gt; &gt;Considering what today's prices must have gotten to it seems like it

&gt; Not a chance that I was going to fly out their and drive it back. I considered
&gt; it for a minute, but then my senses came back to me. It is one thing to spend
&gt; $800 on getting it here, but plane tickets, hotels, 4 days of driving in a
&gt; vehicle that I did not know. That could have been very costly. I knew nothing
&gt; about buses back then and still don't know much. If anything had broken, I
&gt; would have been screwed and stranded.

I remember when I was driving my new-to-me bus home 400 miles from Reno to
SoCal.  I basically just kicked the tires and lit the fires!  I did have
a little safety factor along, in the form of my Dad driving behind in his
Chevy just in case something fell off.

Other than a rather wonky steering box, everything went smoothly.  I was
surprised at the peppy performance of the bus, cruising easily at 65 at
half throttle.

After an hour or so, my Dad comes on the radio and asks if we can
please drive a bit faster than 50MPH.  That was my first introduction to
the rather optomistic qualities of vintage VW speedometers!

Would I have done it solo?  Probably, but that was a trip that I knew very
well, with nowhere that was more than one AAA tow from an aircooled VW
garage.  It was a lot more comfy with another vehicle along.
