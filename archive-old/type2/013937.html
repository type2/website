Subject: Re: blower motor

moving the lever all the way down completes the ckt for the
relay in the engine bay. If the booster motor was stock for
your year that is... there should be a contact at the end
of the lever range with a wire (spade connection).
  This activates the relay that hangs from the roof of the
engine bay off to the right side of the blower fan. Check
an make sure the wire is still connected to the the spade
connector on the lever slide.... if so make sure that the
metal lever arm is making contact with the contact which
looks kinda like a rounded lump of solder.
