Subject: gas station attendants

In responding to my subject &quot;gas leak, 78, NEED ADVICE&quot;, one person
asked if I had topped up the tank.  The short answer is yes, but
there's half a story here that's almost worth telling, so if you're
bored...  [I'm not--I'm working.  Feverishly typing at my keyboard.
Looking busy...]

I live in NJ, and in NJ all gas stations are Full Serve, similar to
Oregon.  You're not supposed to pump your own gas.  I think they raise
'em stupid in NJ or something, because I also hear tell of people who
call their Condo managers when they have a leaky faucet in their
bathroom.  But I digress...

I pull up to the pump, attendant walks over, and I give him the key to
my gas cap.  He goes and futzes for a minute.  Comes back to the
passenger side window, motions back toward the gas cap, and shrugs his
shoulders.

I get out, go around, and remove the gas cap.  By this time, the guy
has walked away.  So I reach to get the fill hose to start putting gas
in the tank.  The guy hurries back over and takes the nozzle out of my
hand and sort of shoos me away.

Then, because of the big vapor recovery hood on the fill nozzle, he
can't get the nozzle to push in the fill neck far enough to turn the
pump on.  So he motions me back over to hold the nozzle, and he
wanders away again.  When the pump shuts off, he hurries back, takes
the nozzle away from me again, tops off the tank, and hangs the nozzle
back on the pump.

Finally, he motions for me to go ahead and put the gas cap back on.  I
do, then walk back to the front of the bus to get my wallet.  When I
come back and hand him the money, he says to me, &quot;I have the same kind
of gas cap on my car.&quot;

HUH?????
