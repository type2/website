Subject: Engine type confusion
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Ok, listees, here's another newbie thing for ya:

I was recently given a '71 Campmobile that was stuffed
full of parts, including 3 engines. Unfortunately,
none of them were installed or running.
The one I decided to use had originally come from a
Beetle, I think - prefix number begins w/AH. That's
73-74 according to the Wilson book, right?
Here's where it gets confusing:
The case has been drilled and correctly tapped for the
rear bus crossmember - fits, I checked. Bolts right up
to the bus. However, I'm at a loss as to shrouding. I
know some of it is the same, but I appear to be
missing a couple of pieces, including the one that
attaches to the front of the doghouse and seals to the
firewall. Also, I think I'm missing the airflaps that
the list seems to agree should ALWAYS be present.
So, what are the differences here? Can I use Beetle
sheet metal, or are there special bus pieces/pieces
for this year of bus?
Related Q: what type of Bosch dizzy does this year
engine use (assuming that I'm right and it is a
73-74)?
TIA,
Thomas
