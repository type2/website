&gt;  I need the URL for Just Kampers. THis is the UK firm that sells all the
&gt;  right tools at a reasonable cost (17 mm socket for 3/8&quot; drive, 46 mm socket
&gt;  for 3/8&quot; drive, 6 mm for CV bolts) and I would like to order from them...
&gt;  but cant locate them with Yahoo,webcrawler,etc. I know they have a website
&gt;  because I have visited them before... but can't seem to find them now. 
&gt;  

[...]

www.justkampers.co_dot_uk

This is a company that I can recomend - always give good service etc, and sale
stuff
that is often claimed to be no longer availlable

Good luck
Bob
