Subject: FW: [T2] tyre life

Yeah, but that is only true if you own a Vauxhall lorry. :)

Seriously, that is what team Discovery's mechanic does with the teams'
bicycle tire tubes. Their mechanic stores them in an old wine cellar. Lance
Armstrong won all his tours on tubes no less than 2 years old!

I think I'll use new tires so I can use the warranty. Besides it would freak
my wife out if I told her, &quot;Honey, I just put on the 5 year old basement
tires! Let's do a roadtrip! Load up the kids!&quot;.
