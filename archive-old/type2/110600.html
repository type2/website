Subject: Re: [T2] lenth of stock A/C belt for 78 westy

&gt; The one I cut off of my 78 Champagne Edition last year is marked
&gt;
&gt; Dayco 15465  and is a little over 46 1/4&quot; long about 1176mm.

belt numbers almost always have the size  coded in the part number
15465  46.5 inches  convert 1181mm
