&gt;A lot of inquiries on non VW rv parking have been coming in from list

&gt;
&gt;Crazy horse Camp-grounds (show site) has full RV hook-ups available, when
&gt;entering the camp-ground for BBB V just tell them you are coming to BBB V
&gt;and they will park you at the closet full hook-up to the show site. If you
&gt;don't need full hook-ups, there will be RV parking near the stage, next to
&gt;the show site. We have room for at least 400 plus buses and there should be
&gt;no problem with close in RV parking.
