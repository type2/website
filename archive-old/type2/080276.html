Subject: Driving with the Sliding door Open

A buddy of mine was driving his '78 in Daytona Beach
spring break '96 (which just happened to be bike
week), and while cruising the main strip with the
slider open, some drunk biker pulled out in front of
them, and promptly fell over.  My buddy locked up the
brakes, the bus slid sideways (counterclockwise) and a
big (10&quot; diameter) metal ashtray flew out of the open
door and hit the guy in the head.  Luckily he was
alright, and no one flew out of the bus.
