Subject: Re: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

I'm sorta on the other side of the road here. It kind of bugs me when I get 
lumped in with the hippies just because I drive a VW bus. There is nothing 
hippie about it. It has a nice exterior, no wild colors, no wild stickers, 
and no a single bumper sticker proclaiming anything.

Are all the Europeans that drive these things hippies? No. Are all the 
Africans that drive these things hippies? No.

Frankly as interesting as the 60's apparently were (I was born in 1970 and 
missed it) I don't long to be in the 60's or relive the 60's. I have no 
problem with the music or the fashion - I like some of both. Never had any 
desire to try drugs though I won't tell anybody they shouldn't - as long as 
they stay off the damn roads when they are high...

Frankly me and mine are just a happy bunch that like to travel and camp and 
sight-see and be outside. I don't have anything against any hippie types 
but I'm not trying to be one of them or like them. Not going to drop out of 
anything or change the world. I'm just quietly living with my little 
family. If some notice and choose to operate like me then that's okay too.

Doing more with less money, seeking to be off the grid in the next 5 years 
and owe nobody for nothing (including our house), and save some serious 
cash so I can retire early 'cause Social Insecurity ain't going to be there 
to save anybody's ass - folks! I have little interest in a life time of 
working myself to death to buy more of the American Dream... Spend 
carefully!!! Save money!!! Break the over-consumption cycle....
