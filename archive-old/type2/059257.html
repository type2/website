Hi,

&gt;                 ... Driving off
&gt; without a proper warmup with *any* car, especially in cold weather, is a
&gt; no-no.

 Have to disagree with you there. I don't know
how cold it gets in WI so I'm happy to accept
that your advice is appropriate for your situation
but I would advise those of us who live in
temperate climes to ignore John Muir's advice
and follow VW's instead: &quot;Except in the coldest
of weather drive off immediately&quot; (driving 
gently until the engine warms up). Apart from the
convenience, the engine warms up faster
under (light) load, and also the gearbox oil gets
warmed up gently too.

&gt;       Well, I went back to FI, which is indeed much superior, but Solex sure
&gt; as heck aren't superior to Webers. It's the other way around.

 Hmm, I have seen lots of messages on the 
bus lists from people having problems setting up 
carbs- often &quot;Weber progressives&quot; or some
such. I don't know whether these problems
are caused by other factors (eg switching to
an 009 dizzy at the same time) or by poor
wrenching, but I certainly have the impression
that swapping to Webers isn't a trivial win-win
proposition.

 No offence meant, just MHO...

Cheers,
                W.
