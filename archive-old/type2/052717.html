Subject: Re: [T2] driving with louvers open = BAD

YES!! there is a big problem with this, it ruins the opening mechanism and will
make the windows unusable , they will not close tight and when trying to open
them the gears will start slipping.. a big problem with old cars is most people
don't have the owners manuals anymore, especially westy manuals, the manuals
tell you not do this and why and i know the result from first hand experience
(wish i'd found a manual sooner :)
as the parts for the jalousie (sp?) are not available outside of junkyards
(eagerly corrected on this ) its a good idea to do as the manufacturer
recommends to preserve them, as  i know, it stinks to have a non functional
window that won't seal up tight or open all the way.
hope i save some people (and buses) some future frustration
