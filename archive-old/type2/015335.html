High,

&gt; gather information on a 1972
&gt;&gt;westy that I might be able to acquire.  someone who was looking at it said
&gt; the only thing wrong with it was the
&gt;&gt;engine.

And via what method of inspection did he determine this??? You'll have to
verify that statement on any vehicle that is 27 years old.

&gt;The bus is in good shape just looking at it on the surface. 

Beware of the facade. Underneath are a lot of expensive parts.
Walk away from rust. Let me say it again. Walk away from rust.
Unless you want a keeper and your going to go all the way with
a compete disassembly, panel replacement and all.

Ask to see the existing documentation. The reciepts should lead the inspection
because they tell you where to look for quality of repair and German rather
than Pakistani parts. Are the shops on the reciepts well known for good
results??? Or is it &quot;Dave's Harley and Ford Repair &amp; Sometimes VW&quot;?

&gt;The guy that was looking at it said the owners wanted $500.00 for it. Is
&gt;this a fair price for that year bus with a bad motor? 

Depends upon whether you want a keeper? If they gave it to you for nothing
and it took $3000 in motor, brakes and dozens of other parts to make it
safe and reliable, would you be happy?? What if it cost $5000 added? 
Still happy?? It could cost that much to get it fully sorted just for
mechanicals, nothing spent yet for esthetics. What is your expectation
and budget?????

Also could someone
&gt;give me an idea on the price of a complete brake job, thetas parts only
&gt;because I can do the job myself.

German or Brazillian. They are two different worlds with two different prices.
Guess which ones meet specs. Check with Bus Boys or others.

Also what does a Tranny go for for that
&gt;year in case this one is bad?

Just ordered one from a reliable independant rebulider and I'm selling
it for $700 exchange plus shipping. Course, that's with new German bearings
dog teeth, syncros and seals. You can get cheaper.

One thing fer sur to check is the carburators. Are they worn out originals??
Check to see if Ron still has new German carbs available. Push and pull at
the throttle shafts. If they move very much at all they will be very
annoying and almost impossable to hold a balanced adjustment or dependable
idle. If we got aftermarket carb or carbs goin on, it could be trash or they
might be danged decent. More data needed.

Check those CV joints and boots. Bus Depot has em fer $50 each. A real bargain
for genuine new Lobro joint kits complete. Everyone who plans on keeping their
van indefinatly should by at least one full set for the shelf. These are the
little opportunities than can help keep the cost per mile down over the
long haul.

It takes me about 2 hours to do a basic inspection designed to identify all
due or overdue maintenance required and mechanical repair that is needed
to make it (1.) Safe and (2.) Dependable, at least until the next 
inspection. Cost to fix everything could be a from a few hundred dollars to
5 large
with motor, carbs, transmission, brakes, CV's and a new set of tires, and
that's
mechanical parts only, no labor. And them ain't the only parts on there,
don't ya know. But they are the spendier ones.

With a lunched motor, knock off about 45 minutes. But wait, do they just THINK
the motor is toast???? Or is it obvious, like a rod through the case???
I have seen people call a motor shot when all it needed was a few basic
maintenance
parts. I have also seen people call a motor &quot;just rebuilt&quot; and you have
fire happenin' before you make it home.   Before purchase, verify or assume
the worst.


&gt;&gt;Thanks again.
