&gt;It takes a lot of tugging and banging

Um, sorry, but this may not be true. I watched
a windshield guy install one in my '71 Westy
while it sat in my drive way. He said the biggest
problem is when people fix rust on the metal sill.
Often times people build up bondo too high which
makes installation difficult. Once it resulted in a
broken windshield the customer had to pay for
because of sheet metal poor repairs.

I made sure my repairs were back to 
the original plane of the sill, and watched
as the tech pulled the cord as he sealed it.
He was using some muscle on the cord but no 
banging at all. When he was done he ran
a bead of silicon around the outside inner
lip of the seal. Good to go and no leaks.

For what its worth, when I pulled my windshield
out, I used a brand new cold chisel. I simply
&quot;shaved&quot; off the seal on the Front. Chisels are
~real~ sharp when new and are beefy enough 
to handle the hard rubber. Then it was a 
simple matter of lifting it off. I know everyone
says its a 2 person job but I found it pretty easy
if you wear gloves and are careful. And, since I
live alone it narrowed my choices a little.
