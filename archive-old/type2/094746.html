Subject: Neat light addition but disables door light:


I took a spare westy camp light I had and mounted it where the VW light 
would be in the front (above driver and passanger). It looks real nice there 
and provides that extra bit of light. Note how the 67 and earlier busses had 
a real nice bright lite there. Now I have it too. 3 bulbs are real nice.

In the back I am mounting two reading lights. I like that too.

Of course the door causing the light to turn on doesnt work anymore, oh 
well. Its a westy and thats ok by me.

On another note I got so tempted the other day....I found a 300 watt 
inverter with 600 watts peak for $30. Wow thats tempting. I dont know what I 
would plug in, but having the electric outlet in the westy hooked up for 
power at all times is tempting....
