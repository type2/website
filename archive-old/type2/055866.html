Subject: '54 RHD progress - frame almost done!

I have now all but 2 small sections of the frame done, and those 2 are more
patches than anything.  Up to this point, I entirely replaced the frame
from 8&quot; forward of the cargo floor all the way back to the curved tube that
goes under the transmission, or roughly 90% of it.

For my next project, I get to decide between the long panel on the driver's
side (which I've already started) or the rear right corner, or the nose.
Any other areas will depend on these being done first.
