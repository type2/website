Subject: Re: [T2] stuck during break pad replacement job continued

I've had it happen on a 4wheel disc brake GM following the 'correct'
procedure. Went out and bought a big ass clamp instead. But, unless I'm in a
hurry, or its a car I've worked on before, I pull the piston and clean and
replace the seal or O ring and bore, but no even when canted in the bore
I've not found any damage. &quot;But&quot; experiance has taught me to stop when
something gets stuck so as not to do damage. On re-reading I think I would
have suggested the same thing as vwbus and crack the bleeder valve, the
little crud can gum things up.

&gt; Both Chuck and vwbus make excellent points I had not thought of.
&gt;
&gt; You may have the piston canted in the bore.  If you do, and the caliper is
&gt; off, just drop the caliper and old pads back into position on the wheel
&gt; and stomp the brakes once or twice.  That will straighten it back out!
&gt;
&gt; If this is true, tho, I would worry about the surface of the bore being
&gt; marred by the piston edge digging into it.  This has never  happened to
&gt; me, which is why I didn't think about it, but if it did, I would seriously
&gt; consider replacing the calipers, as that one is probably going to leak
&gt; pretty bad around the piston/bore.
&gt;
&gt; Chuck, has this happened to you?  Was it OK after you straightened the
&gt; piston out?
&gt;
&gt; What vwbus says is an excellent check for swelled brake lines.  If you
&gt; have real problems getting the piston back in with the bleeder closed, but
&gt; it goes in easily with the bleeder open, then the flex line is
&gt; clogged/dead.
