&lt;&lt; &gt;I like the idea of the wide bottomed, lidded mug.  That way it will fit
 &gt;nicely on the dashboard, within easy reach.  Plus, on those really cold
 &gt;days, it can double as a windscreen defogger/deicer!  Just make sure it's
 &gt;nice and hot.

 just put it down on the floor. &gt;&gt;
