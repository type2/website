Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line Routing and type

Richard has extensive fuel system line documentation on his website
(http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/FuelHoses.html). I picked up hose from
Bus Boys (http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bb13374.htm#11) and am leaving the
metal lines intact. I've added a package of brake line grommets to my
most recent Bus Depot order
(https://secured.webappcabaret_dot_com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=21161175110).
Ron also sells these onsey twosey.

Unless I had a compelling reason to replace a metal line, I don't think
I would.

&gt; When I replaced my '71 Bus's fuel line, if I recall correctly, I removed a
&gt; portion of the metal line which was nearly worn through, but retained a
&gt; straight run of metal line through the fan housing.  I'm pretty sure that I've
&gt; heard of people running the flexible line all the way, but I'm not sure
&gt; whether they use a different route.
