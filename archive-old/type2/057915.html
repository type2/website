Subject: Another Bus in Stillwater OK

By leaving out my address I committed and act that I find extremely
annoying. I sincerely apologize.

The 74 bus I got from Art Long is in Stillwater OK 60 miles North and
a little East of Oklahoma City.

It will be a couple of months before I am though with it. I will wait for
things to cool down some.
