Subject: Re: [T2] three questions


&gt; i have three questions that i am hoping i can get
&gt; answers to.
&gt;
&gt; all questions pertain to 76 Westy &quot;BustedBreadLoaf&quot;
&gt;
&gt; 1. my shifter grinds into 3rd. grinding noise seems to
&gt; be coming from floor beneath shifter, any ideas,
&gt; anyone. searched archives to no avail.

I believe your 3rd gear syncro is going south. The noise is coming from the
transaxle and telescoping up the shifter tube. Wait a little longer going to
3rd from 2nd.

&gt; 2. i have negative camber in the rear wheels of my
&gt; bus. how can i fix this. also searched archives on
&gt; this topic, nothing.

Look in the archives using the word 'sags' or 'sag'. Negative camber is caused
by the torsion bars loosing tension. Either adjust them or cheat by installing
coil-over shocks.

&gt; 3. finally in responding to a fellow listees question
&gt; i ended up with one of my own. in the Bentley Manual,
&gt; Section 5, Page 21 there is a blow up of the cooling
&gt; air system. the final four numbers 50 thru 54 all
&gt; refer to an &quot;extension shaft w/pulley&quot;. on the
&gt; following page Fig. 7-4  refers to an air pump of some
&gt; sort which seems to be related to the extension shaft.
&gt; what is this all about? can one still aquire these
&gt; items and if so, where?

Not on your bus. 72 to 74 only in USA. It drives the air injection pump. Turn
the page, figures 7-4 and 8-1. FI engines did not use it.


&gt; thanks in advance
