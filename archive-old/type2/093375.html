If you break off one of those clips, or if the clip(s) are not seated up 
into the start properly, it becomes a real pain.
Long story, but I learned this the hard way.

Also, put some anti-seize compound on the &quot;hub' of the star so it will 
continue to slide in and out freely as the need for brake adjustment 
becomes necessary.
