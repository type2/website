Subject: Re: [T2] It's Hopeless...There's Hope!

Hey Guys,

Thanks for the quick replies and encouragement.  I changed the condenser and
points back to the ones that came with the bus and guess what... it fired up
and sounds great! It was pouring rain so it's hard to tell what I fixed at
this point, I really wanted to try the new transmission (no taillights
installed yet, so I was afraid to drive it).
I feel a slight exhaust leak on the left heater box to muffler which is
disturbing b/c it's a brand new muffler and new seals...anyone had luck with
any type of sealant or wrap at this joint?
And, the oil cooler that I had taken so much time to remove and have tested
was still dripping a little oil.  I replaced the oil cooler seals and the
local VW shop hooked the oil cooler up to their tester and promised me it
was ok.  I'm hoping this oil was oil still in the grating from the previous
leak.
If it's nice tomorrow, I may degrease the bottom of the engine and check for
any leaks...though I promised my girlfriend I would take a break from the VW
until next week...

Thanks guys,

Tom


&gt; Hey Thomas,
&gt;
&gt; I've been there!!!! When I had my first bus I pretty much had my thumb in
my
&gt; butt for a while, and while you have much more experience than I had at
the
&gt; time,  it can get frustrating when things aren't going smoothly. But at
this
&gt; point you are so close you should keep chugging. Don't waste all your time
&gt; and devotion on some other guy who will change a few wires and get a great
&gt; deal on your bus!!!
&gt;
&gt; The green wire to the dizzy is just your condenser wire...new condensor is
&gt; only a few bucks. Change that and the points and see what happens. Might
&gt; fire right up. And
&gt; if it doesn't what I would suggest is taking a break for a few days or
even
&gt; a week. Do some other project and then come back to the bus with a clear
&gt; head. I found I got so wound up in my bus that I couldn't come up with new
&gt; ideas, etc. without backing up and starting fresh a few days later.
