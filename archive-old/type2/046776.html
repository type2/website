Subject: [T2] Circle-Ur-Wagons campout/show/swap meet

Crap..two good events in the mid-Atlantic this weekend: Octoberbus and CYW. 
I'll be attending CYW in Seviervile, Tn..as I grabbed some really great 
parts last year..cheap.

Have list sticker. Will be in white, 74 Westfakia $400 camper (over 52K now 
:), instead of my SC._dot_cause I froze last year.

Look me up (Old, very short hair..think G Gordon Liddy)..as I'll have a bit 
of homemade wine to share..er, if that were legal.

Show has vendors, huge swap, variety of shows, activities, and AVWA even 
provides 2 meals for the campers. You also get a 2 hour jumpstart on the 
swap meet Sat morning, before they open the gate for the herd.

See ya'

Marv Krupp..who can't even remember what parts he needs now...:(
