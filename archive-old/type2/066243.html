Subject: Rebuilt 1500 won't idle

I recently had the engine from the '67 Rusty rebuilt.  The block was line bored, new main bearings 
installed, case savers installed, new filter/pump added, etc.  In addition to that I just completed 
de-rusting my gas tank with some cool POR-15 stuff.  But, the damn thing won't idle!!!  I have a 
Solex 30 Pict 3 carb and recently rebuilt it.  Obviously I don't know what I'm doing.  But, it did 
idle before the motor was rebuilt so the carb may not be the trouble.

The guy that rebuilt the motor threw in a distributor.  I don't know the whole # but the last three 
digits are '085.'  Is this an earlier version of an '009?'  I have an 009 but the shaft is pretty 
worn out.  I tried using this distributor, the 009, mixing and matching caps/rotors with no 
discernable differences. -- Side note.  In another window I've been searching the vanagon archives 
and saw a message from wabbott where he describes the electromagnet cutoff.  Mine is installed but 
not hooked up.  What do I connect it to?  I have the automatic choke hooked up but don't really know 
how to adjust it.  Is the wire connected to the auto choke supposed to always carry +12V when the 
key is on?  Or is this wire supposed to go the cutoff. --

I need to have the bus running well enough by Sunday to move it to my new house.  I suppose I could 
limp it there but in addition to not idleing it isn't running that great.  Don't get me wrong, the 
rebuild is great, but the carb/ignition is hosed.

Whaddoido?

TIA,
Bob J.
