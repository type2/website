Subject: Re:What did I do wrong? (blowby-and my 250,000mi engine is due
  for rebuild!)

Don't I know- the 245,000 mi engine I have is 20 deg hotter than my 
daughter's 65 when we are both doing 55 mph- and when it is 85 out that 
can mean a dangerous 260+ when having to push even a slight hill. On the 
way to Knoebel's she followed me and little oil droplets were all over 
her front.  It uses a quart about every 100-200 mi depending on how fast 
you drive it.  Most of the loss is in the first 50 miles as it warms up 
and sends oil past old oil cooler seals or rear bearing seal.   Cold my 
oil pressure is still 0ver 150, but hot (250 deg) it runs at 15-18 (55 
mph) and idle pressure is about 2.5.  Even though it sounds and drives 
like a champ warmed up I know I am on the way to failing a bearing, as 
evidenced by the silvery flakes on the oil change screen.  I may be the 
only one in VW history who still has working heads but must rebuild due 
to a a tired bottom end!!!!   Must be how I drive- never floored it for 
more than 10 sec on hills, overev before shifting (trans never rebuilt 
also).

  One thing to remember is that hot oil is thinner and will leak more.
  A bad main bearing that moves will allow the engine to leak even with
  new main seal.
  Blowby will push oil out everywhere.
