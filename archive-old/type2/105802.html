&gt; I put a new VW dealer oil pressure switch in my bus last summer. I
&gt; still get oil all over the left side of the engine. Should the switch be
&gt; installed with teflon tape(I don't think so) and how tight do you crank them
&gt; in there? I know a guy who broke a big chunk of his engine off
&gt; overtightening one of those puppies...

Tom,

No teflon tape, as the switch needs to have electrical contact with the
motor. You could use some teflon thread sealant (permatex makes a good one)
which will seal but still allow metal to metal contact enough to ground the
switch.

What can and does happen is that people put a standard threaded (1/8-27)
switch in the hole at some point in life if the motor. This will sort-of fit
in the m10 x 1.0 hole, but it jeffs up the threads and then you can have
subsequent problems with the m10 switch threading in and sealing.

As for torque on the switch, I don't know. A proper switch should be able to
thread all the way in without doing any damage. If someone broke the case by
threading the switch in too far, they may have had the wrong one.
