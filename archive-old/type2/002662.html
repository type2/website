Subject: Master cylinder gone bad?  '68

Hi,

I posted a while back about losing half our brakes on our '68. The rear
brakes had all been redone (including the lines) but we had temporarily left
the front. After losing our brakes, we checked and saw that the front wheel
cylinders on the right front were wet so we replaced all of the front wheel
cylinders.

Well, the brakes are still &quot;funny&quot; and I was wondering if anyone had ever
experienced this. When I press on the brakes firmly, all seems fine... nice
and stiff. But if I slowly and gently press the brakes, I can almost get the
pedal to the floor and the brake warning light comes on. Doesn't really feel
&quot;spongy&quot; it just goes to the floor. If I keep pressing it seems to not
happen as easily but if I leave it for a few seconds and then try the 'slow
press' again, it goes to the floor. I looked through the archives and I
think I read of a couple of people experiencing something like this but I
couldn't find any definitive answers or conclusions.

We bled the brakes like crazy and used the MityVac pump. No change although
my guy says they actually seem worse to him. We do have stopping power right
now but I'm scared to drive it like this, even just around town. We ordered
a new master cylinder (ouch) and new hoses for the front (we have the lines
which we will also be replacing with this other stuff).

Does this sound like the master cylinder??


Thanks,
Jen :-)
