Subject: Re: [T2] Structural/Frame diagrams for Bay Bus/DC/SC?

There is a guy on eBay who regulalry sells frame Dimension 
chars. I know he had a vanagon chart a little while ago:

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1811805868

Who knows maybe he carries Bay charts too, or may know where 
to get one.

Also, I have a first ediion VWOA Vanagon manual (pre-bentley 
but the same format) that has a body section (section 50). 
That gives several key frame dimensions right to the 
milimetre. I think the part number for my book is W 42-020-
123-1 if you could find the Bay equivalent it would certainly 
help.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt;Subject: [T2] Structural/Frame diagrams for Bay Bus/DC/SC?  
&gt;To: &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Would anyone have any idea of where I could find/buy 
diagrams/sectional
&gt;drawings of '72 on Baywindows (Type2b) which show the 
framework/structural
&gt;members, and dimensions if possible (particularly Single Cab 
&amp; Double Cab
&gt;trucks, but anything would be a help)?
&gt;
&gt;I'm getting close(r) to actually starting my Bay truck 
project, and one
&gt;thing which will create a problem, is that I haven't been 
able to find any
&gt;diagrams which show the structural members of the later 
trucks. ( Grafting a
&gt;Single Cab Bed onto a Double Cab will need the addition of 
reinforcing
&gt;framework, and I'd REALLY like to start planning from 
diagrams, rather than
&gt;just chopping two in half, and then sorting out where the 
reinforcing
&gt;framework can go with a &quot;hands-on&quot; approach. )
&gt;
&gt;Any information and/or assistance would be GREATLY 
appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanking you in anticipation.
