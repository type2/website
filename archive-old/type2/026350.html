	I've used them on my 1600 with a set of baby Webers.  I have also
used them in my old '88 Fox, and there was a NOTICEABLE improvement.  I
really can't say anything about the air cooled though since the kit came
with the filters.

	Eron


Does anybody have any input on a K&amp;N filter?  I have used them before on
several v8's and have ALWAYS had positive results.  Does anyone use one on
2.0L?  What benefit/drawback?  Who has them?  I have seen them at BusBoys,
but their website always locks up my computer with the damn 3 stooges wav
file!  
Thanks
Mike
