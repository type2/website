Joe:

I believe Wilson has a picture of &quot;characteristic&quot; hydraulic camshaft 
wear, and I found exactly that on the two Vanagon camshafts I pulled from 
the two engines I'm rebuilding: the tip of the cam lobes start to get a 
rectangular &quot;notch.&quot;

I believe I read that once these start to wear in this manner the wear 
accelerates, so it's probably cam replacement time.

&gt; Anyway, like I said.._dot_camshaft wear: This engine has hydraulic lifters 
&gt; and I'll assume the appropriate camshaft. It's from a '77, I think, but 
&gt; I don't know for sure that the camshaft is correct for it. From what I 
&gt; can see (pre-case splitting), the camshaft appears to be a little dished 
&gt; just before the lobes. &gt; 
&gt; Comments, questions, concerns appreciated.
