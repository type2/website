Subject: Re: '79 fuel gauge

&gt;One of the POs has obviously replaced the sender in the tank.
&gt;Unfortunately, this was done the quick and dirty way by cutting
&gt;a hole above the fuel tank to gain access to the sender. Could
&gt;an incorrect sender cause this problem? (such as a 68-73).

Quick and dirty, yes.  Incredibly usefull, yes.  IMHO, there should have
been a little panel that unscrewed there to begin with.  I've had all
kinds of trials and tribulations with my gas sender, replacing it a few
times.  Considering the vagueness of most parts matching in Volkswagon,
the sometimes questionable quality of parts, and the importance of the
gas sender, I think a hole cut over it is one of the greatest additions
to a bus.
