Geez, sorry - I sent the first version in enriched text.  I'll try again.

Here's one:  while my engine's out and on the dolly, and I'm removing parts
(latest: heat exchangers) to replace or pretty up, what do you all recommend
to cover the holes (carb and exhaust ports, so far) while it waits for
another day?  Right now I've got a clean rag and a peanut butter jar cap
over the carb and the exhaust ports are stuffed with the plastic from a dry
cleaner bag.  I figure cloth might attract moisture into the exhaust ports.
At various times the garage swirls with sawdust, sandblasting sand, kerosene
and compressed air.  No fair telling me to hurry up and finish the engine
work, I would if I could.  Thanks.
