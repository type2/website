Well, Jim at Beetle Barn in Cambridge, Ohio, is buying my wrecked Riviera
for parts, so I guess my VW adventure is over with for now. Thanks everyone
for being a cool resource, and especially to those who wrote with advice
and sympathy after my accident. Especially Mike, who pointed me at Beetle
Barn, which seems like a super good place.

Here's hoping I see y'all again.

Best regards and happy bussing,
