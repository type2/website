Subject: checking a motor when out of the van

Hello all,Irecently pulled a 2.0 motor from a parts van that had been
sitting a few years- the P/O told me that it ran .My question is:how can
you tell what type of condition the motor is while it's out of the
vehicle? Also Isaw in the library a engine stand w/a starter and
bellhousing does anyone in the NJ area know of a shop where Icould take
the whole shebang and get it started? thanks for youre time. Matt C.
