&gt;howdy list!

&gt;my bus is a '77 with a 2.0L hyd. lifter FI engine.
&gt;
&gt;i checked my oil last night before heading home and was surprised to find
&gt;that it was higher than it was last time i checked it. i checked it again,
&gt;and a 3rd time, same thing. I smelled it: smells like gas. I felt it, feels
&gt;kinda thin.

If you normally use the vehicle for short runs, like 2 or 5 miles to work
and back daily, most of the running time is on the warm up/rich mixture,
and you will build up excess gas over the course of several weeks. If you
don't get the motor fully warm and keep it running for 20 minutes, the gas
will not vaporize and will build up over time.

A compression test comes first. If one injector is leaking excess fuel or a
poor spray pattern, it can lead to wear of the rings and cylinders and loss
of compression. The plug for such a cylinder would likely show black carbon.

If that's good then it could be the cold start injector leaking.

When setting base timing, make sure your at a low idle, not more than 800
rpm. Either the mechanical advance is sticking or your setting timing at
too high rpm and advance has started.
You should be able to grasp the rotor and twist it back and forth through
the advance limit. Sould be smooth and posative with repeatable range. If
it's sticking, squirt some lube down there under the plate till it's
slippery.
