Subject: Fw: [T2] Need a VW in San Jose, CA

&gt; &gt; How do people convince themselves that flying across country to buy a 30
&gt; year old vehicle to drive back sight unseen is a good idea?

I would agree that buying any car sight unseen would not be smart.But I
also bought a bus in San Diego and drove it home to Missouri(1800+miles).I
also had a fantastic helper(Don B) who lives in Oceanside who did a lot of
legwork and inspection and took tons of pictures which were emailed to
me.Plus he drove it several times.It also went to a vw shop for a tune-up
and check up.I also stopped at Richards(cant remember his last name) in
phoenix and picked up a tow bar so my brother could come rescue me if need
be.The owner of the Bus it turns out was an extremely honest fellow who gave
me a very detailed description and history of the bus.He was also using it
as his daily driver at the time.I bought my plane ticket a couple weeks in
advance of my trip date but made sure they were the refundable type just in
case the deal fell through.My Dad thought I was crazy until I showed him all
the emails from the owner and from Don detailing theinspection process,and
then he lightened up a little bit.
     While Im certainly no expert mechanic ,Ive been driving bugs for 14
years and know how to use a wrench if the need arises.My type IV FI bus is
certainly a different beast but I wasnt totally unprepared. I guess what Im
trying to say with all these run on sentances is that its not totally crazy
if you take a few precautions(those hippy dudes need to learn that word)I
did actually give them a couple bucks because I used to be young dumb and
unpredictable too and sometimes you just need a hand even if your in a
situation because of your own stupidity.
      I also must admit I would not even have considered attempting such a
purchase if it were not for friend Don in Oceanside.He was invaluable and I
wll allways remeber everything he did for me with great fondness.The guy is
a VW Hero.I guess what Im trying to say is I think your right,but if you can
find a way to get a vehicle checked out and you prepared to handle minor
problems on the way home its not quite as crazy.Just for the record I took
it real slow on the way home cause it was hotter than shit(it was august)
and I had no problems until a unbelievable storm in kansas,200 miles from
home, got water in the distibuter cap.After scratching my head for a bit and
getting soaked,I figured it out,cleaned out the cap and found the nearest
campground and stopped for the night.Ill also admit that I got very lucky
and even I didnt expect the tripp to go as smooth as it did.Later
