Subject: Removing Windows w/o Cutting....

Hi,

I decided to start my bus restoration today (thanks to all the people that 
have answered my previous posts, helped a lot!)
and after stripping the interior I decided to take out the glass. Now, some 
of the rubber on the bus is only couple years old
and in very good shape (WCM), so I wasn't thrilled about cutting it to 
remove the glass (I know rubber is cheap, but if you start
adding up a lot of cheaps you end up with a huge bill). After thinking a 
little bit how to do it withoutdamaging the glass nor the
rubber I decided to use the reverse of the installation process.

I inserted an extension cord (16ga 3 conductor, the orange type) around the 
perimeter of the window between the seal and the
window sill (this lifts the lip around the sill freeing the rubber), and 
then pushed the glass and rubber out (slowly and evenly around the window). 
I still needed a helper, though, to catch the glass!  The whole process 
took about 5 min per window.

Thought you might be interested. Regards,

Rogelio
