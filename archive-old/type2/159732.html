Subject: Best way to mount sliding windows

Ok, so I'm pretty much ready to install my sliding windows and I wanted 
to see if anyone has any thoughts about the best direction to mount the 
windows.  I've heard that you get better airflow if you mount them 
backwards (i.e. left on right, right on left) because of the location of 
the opening being right next to the person in the back of the car.

The only reason (that I know of) that I wouldn't want to do this is 
because now the slit between the windows is facing the wrong direction 
and would be &quot;catching&quot; the passing air, possibly allowing air to leak in.

Any thoughts?

Thanks!
Mike
