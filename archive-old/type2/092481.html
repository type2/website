Subject: Re: [T2] Spray-in Bed Liners

I was informed that a  local place that  does it for the trucking crowd,
1.  blasts it bare.
2.  puts down a binder layer/primer layer
3.  applies rhino
4.  extracts wallet

&gt; Chris,
&gt; I just went through the whole floor area center part of the van and
&gt; welded closed all of the holes put there by PO's and wire brushed and
&gt; rust converted any rust. Actually there was very little even surface
&gt; rust.  I get the idea that part of the installation process for
&gt; Rhino-lining is to have the area sand blasted first.  Does anyone know
&gt; for sure?
