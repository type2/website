&gt;  As near as I can summarize, oil temps need to go
&gt;  above 212F in order to drive out moisture,

Water can be &quot;driven&quot; out of oil at temps lower than 212F.  Ever noticed how 
hot water evaporates faster than cold water?  
Dino oil starts to break down at temps above 230F.  
The real issue, however, is head temperature.  It's the heads that crack.  
And it's the valves that break and burn.  And it's the valve seats that get 
pushed into the exhaust ports.
You watch your oil temperature because it's an indication of how hot the 
heads are getting.  And it's head problems that are the primary mode of 
failure in the air cooled VW engine.  You know, the old # 3 exhaust valve 
syndrome?
If it were just an oil issue it could be solved by putting a good synthetic 
oil in your engine.  Red Line for instance is good to 500 to 600 degrees F.  
The cylinder heads on the type 1 engine (and probably the type 4 also) are 
annealed at 350 F and are heated to 350 F to install the valve seats.
