Do all of you

&gt; know how many owners your Bus had?

I am the 4th.

&gt;She said that the

&gt; air-cooled engines dont last that long. She asked how many engines my

&gt;Bus has had?

One.

&gt; Am I nuts?

It has been my experience that a good number of people actually know these
things, but YMMV.
