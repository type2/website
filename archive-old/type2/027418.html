hey all,

i have a 1975 westy with a 2000cc engine, why is it that when i look for 
replacement parts in all the catalogs parts are listed as 1800cc 1974 to 
1975 or 2000cc 1976 to 1979.  Why does everyone act like there was not a 
2000cc in 1975????

And what do I look for when I need to, say, replace the pistons and 
cylinders/heads?

Again thanks for the help in advance.  Things just are a little confusing to 
me on my first rebuild.

Adam
