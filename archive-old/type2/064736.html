&gt; Octoberfest time up in Solvang, Ca. on the 5th. About 30 miles north of
&gt; Santa Barbara.
&gt;      One of the best shows and swap meet I've seen, a good time always
&gt; had by all.
&gt;       At Stevenson field on Hwy.246 between Buellton and Solvang.
&gt;  Solvang is a old Danish town with shops , windmills and a cobblestone
&gt; street.  Looks real good when you see all the old volkswagens along the
&gt; main street.
&gt;  More info. at the vintage volkswagen club Golden Gate web page. I don't
&gt; know the URL, but you could use a search engine like yahoo to find it.
