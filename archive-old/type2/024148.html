&gt;  I thought in Brazil they run almost all gas engines with a alcohol mixture.
&gt;  
&gt;  Given the experimentation with electric / propane / -- is there any
&gt;  advantage to running alcohol fuel instead of petrol/gasoline?  Besides the
&gt;  political benefits of staying out of middle east wars, is there any
&gt;  environmental benefit?
&gt;  
&gt;  I presume that are beloved Type1 engine is run in Brazil with alcohol --
&gt;  I've heard reference to this, but not seen a good discussion on it.
&gt;  
&gt;  Any technical information on the differences?  It is just normal carbs with
&gt;  some mods, or a completely different carb setup?
&gt;  
&gt;  Or, I could have all my facts wrong and this topic should die off :)

Hi Steve,

Yes you are right the Brazilian Type 1 engine runs on alcohol. The hand book
for my 98 T2 shows this to be a carbuetted engine. The emmissions control on
this engine is poor.

Those wishing to install a USA (even California) 1998 emmisions compliant
engine should look to the Mexican Type 1 engine. With it's feul enjection its
very clean and despite being a 1600 produces 64hp.

thats what I've got and I'm well pleased with it

Good luck.
Bob

P.S. To EVERYONE - Please do not post questions about importing Brazilian
busses to wherever you live to the list - if you live in the USA it's generaly
accepted that you cannot do so legaly; and if you live somewhere else we don't
know the answer.
