We have heard rumors that they very first type 4 motors used a different
push rod tube.  After doing some investigating it seems that they are no
longer available new. 

Thank you!

&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt;I need one side (4) early 1700 pushrod tubes p# 021 109 335 A w/
23,5mm 
&gt;  &gt;outer o-ring diameter rather than the commonly available superceded 
&gt;  &gt;021 109 335 C  w/ 25mm outer o-ring land diameter.
&gt;  
&gt;  ???  That's the first I've ever heard about that.  I can't find any
mention
&gt;  of it in my books either.  Were the holes in the heads where the tubes
go
&gt;  smaller?  Just curious for more info on this.
&gt; 
&gt; HMMM.. possibly why i have a small amount of p-tube seepage i have yet to

&gt; find an acceptable cure.  i also would appreciate some info on this
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
