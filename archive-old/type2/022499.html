Hi all, 

I'm helping a friend restore/rebuild the engine to his low kilometers 
december '61, '62 model year Bug. The case needed a line bore 
and we wanted to keep the original case to the car. Our German 
machinist took material off of the case halve sealing surfaces 
and machined all the bores back to stock specifications, including 
the oilpump and oil seal bores. We've had several cams in the 
case for trial fitting and found that we need a -3 cam with gear, 
a -4 might even be better but we haven't had a chance to try one yet. 

We want to assemble the engine in coming days and have called 
several places in the UK, Germany, Holland and Belgium in search 
for the missing nos cam in the correct size, nothing so far. We would 
greatly  appreciate any leads or help on finding a nos 40Hp cam with 
-3 or -4 gear, they are the same as cams for later engines. The 
partnumber for the -3 cam is 113 109 015 D. The minus 4 hasn't been 
listed in VW catalog material since '95 at least.

TIA

Brian
