      Yeah, I know, and I have heard of that happening -- but I've been
buying and selling on the net for about ten years now, and only had three or
four problems. I used to be very trusting, back in the days when very few
people had access without showing an ID, and used to just send people money
orders all the time, or a personal check if they'd take that. No more -- now,
unless it's a known, established business, I do it COD, or, if it's only a
small amount, just base it on vibes.
      I bought a &quot;PCMCIA memory card&quot; on two different occasions from two
different individuals which weren't what they were supposed to be, but asked
for my money back and got it. I bought a 2.88 floppy drive once which was
junk and the guy gave me my money back. Once I sent a money order to a
webpage that advertised &quot;same day shipping&quot; and after waiting two weeks,
started emailing them everyday about my order -- they didn't answer me until
I started posting &quot;RIPOFF&quot; notices to the misc.forsale newsgroups everyday
adbout them. Then they called me a faggot -- nice businessmen, but I got my
money back.
     So I started buying COD only, except as I stated above. It's the only
way I'd buy, say, a $1000 item from an individual. I've bought a $800 printer
that way, probably am soon going to buy a $1000-1500 video projector that
way. But I'll check the guy out first. Here's a link to a one place to check
people out:

    http://darkwing.uoregon_dot_edu/~wharmon/vndlinks.htm

  If it's a place like this list, for instance, check the archives -- anybody
bitchin' about the guy?
    One guy I bought a hardrive from advertised on the misc.forsale groups. I
liked the price, so I emailed him and asked him to send it COD. No, he
replied. I'll just send it to you (and this was a brand new 2gig when 2 gigs
were big) and you install it, check it out, and if you're happy with it, send
me a check, otherwise send it back. I freaked -- figured he had to be a con
artist, right? Nobody would be that dumb! But after thinking it over, I
couldn't  figure out how he could rip me off, so I said okay. It was a great
drive, still running without a hitch, must be close to 3 years now.
     I asked him how he could stay in business doing that -- he said he did
it on vibes.
Another thing -- if somebody sends you a box of rocks instead of the computer
you ordered and paid for COD -- he's just committed a federal felony, and it
isn't that hard to get charges pressed. Most people are just not that stupid.
Most of the scammers want you to send them money -- or your credit card
number.
