I recently looked for one of these, and so far I have
heard that they are not available, go to a junkyard,
and that they are &quot;obsolete&quot;.  So how does one go
about geting them?  Am I not looking in the right
places?  I'm looking for new, but a good shape used
one I could clean up would work.  If there is anywhere
I could look which I haven't, please let me know.  
Thanks
