&gt; Hello all, I'm having trouble disconnecting electrical connector from back

Marcus,

Look closely where the connector meets the AFM, you will see a thin wire
clip that holds the plug into place.  *Most* times, wiggling the plug is
enough to work it off, but if it does not come with a gentle wiggle, then
take a jewelers screwdriver and pop that wire clip out.  After 20+ years,
the plastic on those plugs gets brittle and if you pull real hard, you
will bust the plug :-(

I have made a simple gallery of what the clip looks like and put it at:

Basically what to look for and where to pry :-)
