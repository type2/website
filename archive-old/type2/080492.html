Subject: Re: [T2] steering coupler folks be aware!!!!

&gt;      I recently had to replace my steering coupler again after having
&gt; replaced it a little under a year ago.   Seems that the reproduction couplers
&gt; have very little reinforcing in them.  Reinforcing being that cord stuff.  I

This is a real pisser. I pulled the steering column out of a rotton 68 and
tries to just break off the 30+year old crusty coupler and had a devil of
a tiome as it was reinforced inside with STEEL BRAID. Even if all of the
rubber fell off youd still have some steering with that thing. I wonder if
a real VW replacement is still full of steel. Ron? This would be one place
to pay more for quality I would think.
