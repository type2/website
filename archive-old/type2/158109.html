Subject: Re: [T2] CHT Sensor on new 1600 heads

&gt; My install of new heads on my 1600 is complete and up and runnning. I
&gt; noticed the new heads each have holes tapped, presumable for a CHT
&gt; sensor(s). I understand this is probably for use on 1600 FI Beetles.
&gt; Where could I find sensors for these heads that I could use with a
&gt; standard temp guage such as the VDO guage? Sure would save some time
&gt; and effort in the future if I could make these heads last a long time.

A standard VDO CHT gauge expects a k-type thermocouple. You'd just  
need to terminate some thermocouple wiring to a suitable ring  
terminal and mount it to the sensor hole using a 10mm bolt.

Keep in mind that the temperature readings from that location are not  
in sync with the area around the spark plug where the thermocouples  
are usually placed. In order words, the temp readings you get won't  
be comparable to other engines that are using the spark plug terminal  
(99% of people).

That area of the head is also slow to respond to temperature changes.  
L-Jet mainly uses that location for warm up enrichment...
