&gt; FWIW an old guy dad used to work with (at AT&amp;T) in the 70's used to
bolt bits of Mg sacrificial annode (that AT&amp;T used to attach to their
underground cables for exactly the same purpose) to the frame and body of
his vehicles.  He was still driving a '50s Chevy pickup in the late 70's
long after it would have normally succumbed in salt laden WV.  We had
several of the annodes laying around the house and I always meant to try,
never had.  This is a purely passive thing but I don't know those active
systems JC Whitless and the others have pawned for years don't work.  VW
did this themselves to some extent with the little zinc annode plates
bolted between the front fenders and unibody of their FWD cars, I assume
they still do.  How bad they would rust without them is an unknown to me,
I have seen replacement fenders rust worse than factory when a body shop
ommitted them but probably also off shore sheet metal so who knows.  So
maybe/maybe not entire snake oil.  All corrosion is
&gt;  electro/galvanic/whatever in nature.  You can have a scarificial
annode for your waterboxer heads now days, and all hot water heaters have
them, will they help on a car body???

Only if the car body is immersed in a somewhat conducitive electrolyte
like water with a few impurities in it.

The sacrificial anode work by creating a weak sort of battery and then
sacrificing itself before the metal it is attached to starts to sacrifice
itself.  Without the electolyte it doesn't work.
