&gt;selling the bus or keeping it? Is this their first rebuild or their 
&gt;seventeenth? Did they have the engine built or buy a rebuild?
&gt;
&gt;If you will become familiar with the various systems comprising a bus and 
&gt;diagnose each system for strengths and weaknesses, you'll be far happier.

you will find you will learn plenty about *your* bus inside and out once
you *own* it Perry - regardless of how paranoid you are when considering
it's reliability before you make the purchase.

be patient, have fun and good luck - i mean it.
