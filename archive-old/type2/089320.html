&gt;The sound you describe may be caused by a loose tin screw being tossed around by the squirrel cage fan.

&gt; I heard it and when I asked about it the guy pointed out a hole in the muffler. You
&gt;could feel the exhaust coming through under pressure. There is also a slight
&gt;sound like a marble rolling around in a coffee can. &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;I would be interested in any thoughts on that little marble-y noise. I don't
&gt;think that this is normal, but then again doesn't sound like anything real
&gt;serious. Hmmm..   Jan B


Sounds like worn-out muffler bearings 8^)
