Pat,

VDO seem to be the gauges of choice for Volkswagens, partly because they 
will match all your other gauges and partly because of their quality.

You should be able to find a drain-plug, or dipstick sender for your 
engine.  If you have a type IV engine (which I don't think you have) you 
can put a sender in that flat plate with two screws which is on the later 
engines.

Whatever you do, don't put an oil temp sender at the top of the engine 
(in a T-fitting with the oil pressure sender) because there is no oil 
flow up there, so in effect you are getting a crankcase temperature reading.

They are easy to install, and so far I have had no trouble with any I put 
in.  Taking them out shouldn't be a big deal either, except for the 
above-mentioned plate-sender which needs to have a hole drilled for 
installation.

As for that person who gave you the &quot;advice&quot; about gauges.  Would he 
refuse to put a smoke detector in his house because it does not ventilate 
the air, or dowse the flames?  

Get my drift?  Gauges simply give you more information about the running 
of your engine so you can monitor changes/irregularites etc.  Better to 
have them than not.  As for the dipstick test for oil temp - Mickey Mouse!

Good Luck
