Subject: [T2]  Dizzy Help Update

Ok all,
  I removed the dizzy and found that the shaft had two small o rings. I
looked in Bentley and found that there should be a &quot;single O ring&quot;. So now I
know why its leaking oil and that I will never take the bus back to the shop
who fixed it. Now I was wondering where I can pick up one of these O rings?
Any info will not be turned away.

TIA

Brad




Volks,
  Here is what I have '79 2.0L FI with CALIF Emissions.

  I have a two part question: First does the Dizzy have a gasket/seal to the
case? (I think I am leaking oil around the shaft of the dizzy).

Second:
  If a seal/gasket does happen to be there, what is the sure fire way to
remove a dizzy. I have never pulled a dizzy so please make the procedure a
simple as possible.  I read the bently manuall and I think I can do it. Any
information will be greatly appreciated.

TIA
