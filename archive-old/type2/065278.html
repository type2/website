There is a marking on the tops of the valves that marks them as being 
sodium filled. This is important to shops that grind valves. Sodium 
filled valves cannot be ground, if memory serves. 

The valve stem is solid, but the head of the valve is hollow, and, as 
the name implies, is filled with sodium crystals. As the valve heats up, 
the crystal phase changes (correct me if the term is incorrect), and 
this helps keep the exhaust valve running cooler. The valve heads tend 
to expand more than solid heads, thus the slightly greater clearance.

This is not new technology. My dad's 1959 Ford trailer truck had filled 
valves, from the factory, in its big Lincoln engine. As I recall, these 
were filled with magnesium, though. More than once, while towing a 
mobile home up a grade, one of these valves snapped off. The result was 
like throwing a hand grenade into the engine. Once it sheared head bolts 
in the ensuing explosion.

When I was first learning to repair cars, our shop teacher told of 
horror stories of grinding these valves. Having your grinding equipment 
suddenly explode could ruin your whole day. Maybe someone can fill in 
the details about grinding sodium filled valves. They aren't explosive, 
are they?
