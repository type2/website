Subject: Re: type2 Digest 23 Mar 2002 10:00:00 -0000 Issue 790

&gt; have thought of it.  I, too, have not done it.  I am amazed that the
&gt; EXU does not have a ground directly to its case and from there to the
&gt; body, but the PC board is rather deliberately insulated from the case.

I was thinking of putting another ground on the engine in a more
convenient place, then jumpering that ground to the wires going to the
grounds behind the plenum.  I want a ground that I can keep clean easily.

I think the reason that the ECU is not directly grounded to the chassis is
to prevent &quot;excitement&quot; :) inside the box if the main ground strap fails
and a start is attempted.  Even the charging current from the alternator
would be pretty nasty for the circuit board if the &quot;electronic ground&quot; was
the only path.  VW's plan of grounding the box's circuits directly to the
engine and keeping it isolated from the chassis probably had some thinking
behind it.  I recommend keeping it that way.

similar topic. I was working on a MB 300D once where the battery negative
was a volt or so above the chassis potential when the engine was running.  
The vehicle had had a lot of electrical parts (alternator, battery,
starter) replaced by folks whose initial effort was always to jumper the
fuse. Traced the problem to a loose chassis-engine ground strap.  A very
expensive loose bolt.  Engine start current had been grounding through the
outer of one of the mechanical cables (throttle?, shutoff?) going to the
engine and the battery would run down over three or four days.
