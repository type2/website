Subject: Popped valve seat picture

http://picasaweb.google_dot_com/georgegundesen/VanagonEngineRebuildMkII

I thought people might want to see what a popped valve seat looks like 
and what damage it does.  I probably got away lucky as it merely gouged 
the piston a bit.  As I get inside the case I will look for any 
excessive pounding on the rod bearings due to the impact from the seat 
to the piston. Hopefully the damage will be visible if there is any.

As far as the head goes I'll have to speak with an expert to ascertain 
whether the damage from the seat can be welded and machined back to 
normal. Any experienced comments?

Note this was all on cylinder #4, not the 'normal' hot #3.

Should I get both heads checked out/redone again? I only had a few 
thousand miles on them before all this.  What are the chances other 
seats might do the same thing?  When the motor went south it was just 
started from cold, and 2 blocks from my house driving slowly.  The 
previous 3000 miles including back and forth over the continental divide 
was where the overheating occurred.
