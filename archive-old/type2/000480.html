&gt;I think I found the problem that's keeping my bus from
&gt;starting...but it's not fixed yet (never heard that from *me*
&gt;before, have you?)
&gt;
&gt;A while back, I replaced the plug to the cold start valve and I
&gt;think I mixed up some wires. The times it started for me would
&gt;have been times that I caused one of the wires on the
&gt;improperly-wired cold start valve to come loose. See?
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, now I've got to figure out which terminal on the cold
&gt;start valve connects to which terminal on the thermo time
&gt;switch...or does it matter?

Have you rewired your harness or are you talking about possibly mixing up
which wiring module goes to which device? I would start with Bentleys test
for the thermo time switch (10.4.3) to find out whether all components in
that area working properly. This would tell you if the If your tests
indicate that the thermal time switch is shot, look at the test for the Aux
Air Regulator and see if that matches what you seeing. It could be that the
AAR wiring module and the Cold Start Wiring Module are backwards, (on my 79
they are within two inches of each other). Theory of operation being that
the thermo time switch shuts down the flow of electricity to the cold start
valve after between 8 to 11 seconds depending on which thermal time switch
you have, but the AAR has electricity provided to it continutally. If you
were to switch those two modules (cold start and AAR) I would think that the
cold start valve would never stop shooting gas into the motor and the AAR
wouldn't close until the engine was very, very warm. This would make for one
sh**ty running motor.

&gt;More generally, when you're hooking up terminals to fuel injector
&gt;plugs, does the side of the injector that each terminal connects
&gt;to make a difference? I would think not, since it's like a switch
&gt;that's either on or off. Right?

An injector is actually a solenoid controled valve. Some solenoids are
polarity sensitive. Just to be certain before I answered I ran a test on a
spare injector; it makes no difference. But the modular connector should
only go on one way...

&gt;BTW, the running joke in my house is me running in swearing that
&gt;I've found the problem with the bus...my wife looks at me lovingly
&gt;and says &quot;Great, honey!&quot; The kids roll their eyes. Sometimes
&gt;Kristy asks me how much it's gonna cost. I may not be too bright,
&gt;but I'm persistent. :)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe
