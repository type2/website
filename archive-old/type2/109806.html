Subject: 74 Manual Trans fun and games

this can get to be boring pretty quick.....

I just installed a trans with 4.57 R&amp;P and I think it is too tall gear set?
I normally drive in flatland Southern Ontario Canada.... but venture to
Virgina, PA.. for a few days a year.
Would a 4.86 R&amp;P be better than a 4.57 ?


here is the story...
I started out with my Camper:

  1974 Vw Transporter Westfalia
1.8 liter carb engine,  calif.
3995 lbs empty
continental CR91   195R14 tires

[#1]
 002 trans  with 091 bellhousing  using 210mm clutch pressure plate
flywheel and a SR87 starter
5.375 -[43]ring and [8]pinion,    4th  0.82
I know that for sure as I have the trans apart, and can count the teeth
4th gear syncro wore out
This arrangement was topped out at 130kmph  or 80mph, downhill with a
tailwind on the day of least gravitation pull of the moon.


[#2]
I put in a Trans of unknown origin,, 002 trans with 002 bellhousing and
SR15 starter ,210mm clutch
and have driven it for over 150,000 kms
I just removed it,, and I know it has a 5.375 -[43]ring and [8]pinion,
I know it went down the road at 4000 rpm at 120km/hr  75mph
I don't really want to pull the gear cluster out to count 4th,,,,,

I was *sure* that I was up about 200 rpm, and down about 5mph with this
trans compared to #1
I can't rely on that as I didn't have a tach then,
Although, this arrangement was topped out at 150kmph  or 90mph
*repeatativly* on the 401 hwy going east down into the Don River ravine


[#3]
New Engine, 2.0 liter, hyd lifters
EFI with orange ECU 022.906.021S Bentley says is a 1977
 and AFM 022.906.301D  Bentley says is a 1977

I have just installed a 091 trans 6 ribs, with 002 belhousing  --shifter
linkage length issues.... see below
SR15 starter and 210 clutch
4.571 -(32)ring and (7)pinion,
travels down the road
3rd gear , 80kmph, 3600 rpm
4th gear, 80kmph, 2600 rpm
                90kmph, 2925 rpm
               100kmph, 3200rpm
               120kmph, 3800rpm &lt;my travelling speed! :-)
This seems to be top speed right at the moment,, flooored with a good
tailwind ,,, flat road,,, 120kmph
Lots or power in lower gears, pulls strong, quiet, and smooth,, but
doesn't seem to have the same top end
Would this be due to EFI limitations??

I wondering,, is this tooooo tall gearing,,,,
Those with a 1978 bus would be comparable, I think,,
I am contemplating putting in a trans with a 4.875  -[34]ring and [7]pinion
that is a 002 trans with 002 bellhousing, and 5 ribs
I think that the above will not have shifter linkage length issues,,



shifter linkage length issues.... seems the 091 trans is longer  in the
shifter &quot;hockey stick&quot; area than the 002,
this means the shifter is  too far back in the early body,
i.e, when installing a late bay trans , 091, into a 1974 -002 trans body,
the shifter is pulled back to the rear tooo far.

I remedied this by shifter adjustment, and a Straight stick shift, and
drilling a new &quot;dimple&quot; in the hockey stick, about 5mm closer to the trans
nose cone. this allows about 2mm clearance to remain between the shift
coupling, and the nose cone bushing when in 1st and 3rd

It pulls the shifter back into normal place.
