Subject: self retracting belts that fit a 79 Westy???

I scrounged through the wrecking yard today and couldn't find a self
retracting seatbelt that would fit into my 79 Westy. The ones from later
bugs(which are too short anyway)  and vanagons all have the belt mechanism
pointing straight up like this.

             belt
          comes out

      |                   |

      |             ---
      |   _____|   |
      |   |/_/_/_/   |        &lt;--- bolt goes in this way through steel mount
      |             |--|

Type2's have the seatbelt mount horizontally on the flat behind the seat.
The bug and vanagon mounts are on the side or vertical. The retractors will
not pull out when laid flat as they are designed to stop when not vertical.
Can I make 90 deg. adapters to mount the vanagon belts which ARE long
enough? This way I could use them in my Type2. Does anyone know of some
belts that are DIRECT BOLT INS??, so I don't have to make these adapters?
Thanks,
Courtney
