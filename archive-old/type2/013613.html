Don:

I'm slowly becoming a POR-15 &quot;expert&quot; , so I'll share what I've encountered so far.  First of all, you should check out the website, because they go into pretty good detail on how to use their products.  

http://www.por-15_dot_com/

Here are my thoughts:

I use the POR-15 silver on any rusted and pitted metal, because it has metal particles in it that are supposed to make it stronger than black POR-15.  I buy the 6-packs, as opposed to the larger individual containers, because the larger containers somehow never seal correctly after they're opened, and the stuff ends up drying out, and it's too expensive to waste like that.  It's a little more expensive for the 6-packs, but you waste far less product, so in the end, it's a much better deal.  I've also used the fibreglass cloth they sell, following their instructions, and it seems to work as well as advertised.  I had a small rusted through area on an interior wall, and now it can't be seen.  I used the 2-part epoxy they sell, as body filler on the hole I used the fibreglass cloth on, and also to repair my steering wheel.  It's great stuff.  Easy to work with, and cures very hard, yet sandable.  

If you want to use POR-15 as an undercoat, it needsd to be covered with a product called tie-coat primer.  Auto paints won't stick to POR-15, but if you use the tie-coat primer, you can then use any auto paint to paint your bus.  I plan on using POR-15 in this manner on much of my bus.  Since it goes on with a brush, you can do small sections at a time.

Things to be aware of:

The company says to use their metal prepping stuff before coating with POR-15.  I've used POR-15 both with and without the metal prep, and I haven't seen any difference in how the POR-15 bonds with the metal.  I think if you remove loose rust, and de-grease the surface well, that would be enough.  
Their Marine Clean is a nice environmentally-safe degreaser that works well.  I use a degreaser that I bought at a bicycle shop.  It is also safe, but is concentrated, so a can makes something like a gallon of degreaser, which I mix in a spray bottle.  I forget the name of the bicycle-shop stuff, but you can probably call a bike shop near you and see if they have anything like it.

Also, wear rubber gloves when using POR-15.  If you don't, you need to clean your skin immediately, or the paint will stay on for at least a week.  Their website sells rubber gloves, and also disposable brushes.  I hate cleaning brushes when paint thinner is involved, so I use disposable ones when I use POR-15.  The brushes they sell are actually about the best disposable brushes I've ever used, and a great deal, in my opinion.

Hope this helps.
