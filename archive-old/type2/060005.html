Subject: Re: Surface rust

I would like to leave a bit if info re: rust prep and the use of acid
products/conditioners.
I have run into 2 drawbacks that have caused me enough trouble to now use
converter type products instead.
1.  They need to be rinsed extremely thoroughly.  Any remaining acid in
cracks and crevices will, later on, cause problems in the final sprayed
finish.  Not what you want.
2.  The water rinse introduces another surface rust process to begin.
Extra work.
later
