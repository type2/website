Subject: [T2] hooking up a tachometer

Just want to make sure that I'm doing this right...

It measure the tach with a trusty tach/dwell meter,
you hook up the same way you hook up a dwell meter? 
That is, the positive to the little wire going to the
distributer and the negative/ground to ground?

Thanks,
Dano!
