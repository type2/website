&gt; By the way, (obligatory Bus content) did you know that the intake manifold
&gt; for an AS (mated up to a dual port 1600) is the same as the manifold used
on
&gt; a Bus (1600, of course) with vacuum assisted brakes?

It also uses a 211K?
I found one on a 71 bus this past  weekend. Didn't someone want one?
