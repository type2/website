Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof

I guess i should clarify too, the crank operation is shot, drain tubes may be
cleared, but i can always clear them. the metal sunroof will slide open and
closed, but to fully closed it I have to put little blocks under it for it to
fit in the hole, me and my dad made a vinal button down tarp to go over the
whole sunroof, (looks good by the way), might like to rig up some kind of
removable tent thing for the top, but i would like to make the crank work.

&gt; &gt; Hi, I'm new to this group, I have always had a VW but it's been a Baja
&gt; &gt; or a Bug, I now have a 70 Transporter with a bad sunroof. The cranking
&gt; &gt; mechanism was so bad an rusted that it came out in one piece, I would
&gt; &gt; also like to kind of make it into a camper, any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; A junkyard in your area may have a wrecked camper; unless it's been rolled
&gt; the fiberglass top should be okay, and since factory-made campers started
&gt; off life as sunroof Buses, you have a nice head start.
