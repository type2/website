I have to take a business trip this weekend and will be driving the '67 bus. Yesterday during lunch I began my tune procedure. I started with the brakes and that pretty much shot my lunch hour. When I got home from work I started the rest of the mechanicals. Everything went fine except I tried to get a little more life out of a valve cover gasket than it wanted to give :) Fixed it and took another victory lap.

On the way to work I stopped at the gas station by the office. While I was there I did a quick check of wheel temps and did the dipstick test. All was cool. I fired up the bus and pulled out and heard SuQEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK.WTF? I got faster as I sped up and slowed down with me as I pulled through the parking lot. Then it stopped. Then started again as I pulled into the office park. I did a few laps around the building and it came and went and came and went. 

I parked the bus, grabbed the roof rack and shook the bus thinking that it may be suspesion oriented but alas all was quiet. 

The sqeak is loud and seem to share frequency with the rotation of the wheels. Does not sound like a bearing and has no connection with turning or going straight. 

The only thing I can think of is my speedp cable often makes a lot of rackety chirping when it is cold(it is cold this morning). This is accompanied by a dancing speedo needle. I just have not gotten around to doing anything about. I have noticed that if I reach under the speedo housing and grab the cable the regular chirp stops. This morning I noticed the speedo needle dancing more wildly and at lower speeds then usual so I reached under the dash and wiggled the cable but there was no real change. Could the loud squeaking be the speedo cable? Did I set into motion a disastorous chain of events by messing with something that was not broken yet(this is normal for me :)?
