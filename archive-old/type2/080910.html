Subject: Re: [T2] urgent question/mot/apk

The switch is located at the transmission, and is turned out by the
transmission being put into reverse. You should be able to find it easily by
following the wires back from the backup lights to the transmission.

While it may be the switch that is faulty, it is more likely simply a loose
wire or connection that you should be able to fix easily.

Good luck.
