&gt; There is (was) a museum a couple of blocks away from the assembly plant in
&gt; Wolfsburg that had a bunch of old buses including a 1950 model.
&gt; 
&gt; I may skip the museum this time as I wasn't too impressed last year.

If you can make Berlin, go to the Transportation Museum. Much better than
the Wolfsburg one.

(While you're there, hit the Haus am Checkpoint Charlie, which is the Berlin
Wall escapees museum, and see the very, very small car that they managed to
sneak a full-sized East German out of the DDR in. They stuffed him behind
the back seat. I still don't know how.
