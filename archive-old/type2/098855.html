Subject: stock compression ratio

	Well apparently I am not using the frekin' web correctly today. I
can find all sorts of arguments on why I should run a high or low CR
for my 1979 2.0 Liter engine. What I cannot stumble across is what the
stock CR for this particular engine is actually. if anyone knows off
the top of their heads, I'd appreciate it.
