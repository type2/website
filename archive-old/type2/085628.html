Subject: Re: [T2] more 79 cali distributor

 
--My '79 cali times at 5 degrees ATDC, with hoses connected.

However, Karl is totally the man on this one. Karl, did you sell a beige 76 weekender w/ a '79 engine to a kid in fresno in about '91-92

&gt;My stock 78 fed dist doesn't have the retard either, but it's sitting in a
&gt;toolbox and the 79 CA is on the van without the retard connected.
&gt;
&gt;My questions are should the 79 CA dist be timed the same as the 78 fed dist
&gt;when the retard is not connected,
&gt;and should I disobey my mechanic and connect it and retime it?

&gt;Jeff,
&gt;
&gt;My 78 stock fed original does not have retard on the dist.
&gt;
&gt;I'm pretty sure that it is timed at about 7.5 degrees and does *not* have
&gt;an egr.
&gt;
&gt;Jeff, I think my total advance is about 40+ degrees...
&gt;
&gt;Hope that helps, dave
&gt;

&gt;&gt; OK more opinions requested here. To recap, 78 2L rebuilt with about 15K
&gt;on
&gt;&gt; it, stock FI, 140psi comp all around. I upgraded to a 79 Calif
&gt;distributor
&gt;&gt; electronic ignition setup. The coil is still the Bosch Blue but will be
&gt;&gt; replaced with a electronic ignition coil (what years Rabbit and Audi are
&gt;&gt; correct?).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The question is timing. My mechanic had me connect the vac advance and
&gt;cap
&gt;&gt; the retard. He then timed it to 8 BTDC at idle. It runs great.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; He said I didn't need the retard. When I pressed him on it he pointed out
&gt;&gt; that I didn't have my EGR connected and I had a 78 engine, cam and FI
&gt;&gt; brain. I shouldn't connect the retard with a setup like that since things
&gt;&gt; were different on the 79 Calif FI brain. A recent thread said that this
&gt;&gt; timing is pretty close when your not using the retard, tho I think it's a
&gt;&gt; little retarded. The correct timing with the retard vac connected is 5
&gt;&gt; ATDC. I haven't checked what my total advance is at 3600RPM, the specs
&gt;say
&gt;&gt; it should be 21-25 with this distributor.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Opinions? I don't have all the parts for the EGR which I really should
&gt;get
&gt;&gt; hooked up since it cools the engine, but is the 78 Fed engine/FI
&gt;different
&gt;&gt; enough from the 79 CA engine/FI that I should NOT connect the retard
&gt;&gt; vaccuum and reset the time to correct specs?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks
