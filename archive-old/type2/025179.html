I am a little disapoingted that I can't look this up on the archives,
but...what type of oils are people using? I live in Colorado and only drive
my bus on road trips, mostly in the mountains.  Any suggestions are
appreciated.  If you don't want to clog up the list, you can p-mail me.
Thanks- Rawls Moore
