Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Build (Difficulty Rating?)

Dave,
I'd considered doing a rebuild myself, with the Al 
case.  I've seen them as cheap as $285.  It's still on 
my list of &quot;possibles&quot;.

How high on the 'Difficulty Scale' is replacing the 
case?  I understand the process of gutting my engine 
and placing said guts in new case, but how hard is it 
really?


Later,
