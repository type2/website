Subject: Re: [T2] Exaust Leak

Steve,

Whoops!!!  Al is absolutely correct on both points and I left them out of
mine.  I'd change the order...

First, SAFETY GLASSES!!!  first and foremost!  and goggles are better...
there is always a lot of rust down there and you don't want an
opthalmoligist flicking at your eye with a steel needle, do you? (BTDT)

Second, heat. Al is better at this than I am, he has a proper torch (and
lovely assistant :-), so this works better for him, but a propane torch
will definitely improve things.  Red heat, then hit it with the socket
while it is hot as he said.

I've never used sealer, but it may well help... I will look into this for
next time.  And the brackets come under &quot;of course!&quot;  If they are not
there, you are certain to be back down there in a couple months.

Lastly, I just remembered, John and I found metric stainless nuts when we
installed my engine 2 years ago, and I gotta tell ya'... they are the
cat's meow on subsequent removals!  They won't help this time, but are
definitely worth looking for if you plan on keeping the bus.

                           Steve Dolan
