Subject: Re: [T2] license light - Karl?


[...]

&gt; Both show a switch in front, part # 111 955 511B that was used from 68 to
the
&gt; end of 74 [214 2300 000].
&gt; I know the front one has door jamb switches and a 3 position switch on the
&gt; light [door open on/off/on].
&gt;
&gt; The dash switch listed above has to be for the rear light. To turn it on
from
&gt; the front. I believe the rear light would need a 2 position switch on it for
&gt; the people in the back......
&gt; But this raises a question.... on my 67, I have a switch for the rear dome
&gt; light on the left side of the speedo pod. It turns the power on and off to
the
&gt; rear dome light. If I have it on, then the rear dome switch will turn the
&gt; light on and off. If I have it off, the rear dome switch is dead and the
light
&gt; stays off.
&gt; Does the 68-74 work this way also?  Or is it wired like a 3-way house light
&gt; circuit??  Inquiring minds want to know:)

I have another question that I neglected to include the first time.
The front door jamb switches, part # 113 947 561D, is the same as the one on
the sliding door starting in 69 [68 did not have it]. This is on buses, not
Westies.
How does this switch effect the operation of the rear dome light?
Does the jamb switch turn on the light only if the dome light switch, on the
light, is off?
Having a sliding door switch sounds like you would need a 3 position light in
the rear like in the front!
