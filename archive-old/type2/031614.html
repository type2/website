&gt; I do not want to venture too far into Canada, maybe a hundred  miles or a
&gt; little more, but looking for peace and quiet, maybe a little fishing for
&gt; Northern Pike, etc.   Any one with recommendations and/or personal
&gt; experiences would be helpful.

try Algonquin Provincial Park...I had a great time there some years ago
it was inexpensive and rather empty even in June...good fishing from what
I hear, I'm not into fishing.
