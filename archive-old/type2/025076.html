Whoa, hold on here a second. I felt compelled to add my .02 cents here. If
you're spraying this yourself, you need to be extremely careful if you're
adding a hardener to the paint. When I painted my Westy last year, I bought a
can of hardener to add to the paint ( Dupont acylic enamel ) After reading the
precautions on the can of hardener, I decided NOT to use it. It requires the
use of a respirator with an outside air source, a dust mask or even a canister
type respirator with filters is not enough. This is some serious sh*t here,
and I would'nt take it lightly. I want to see my 6 yr old daughter graduate
&gt;from high school, college, and get married someday, not spend the rest of my
days having someone wipe the drool from my chin. Read the labels carefully.
Just my thoughts.      Jeff S.
