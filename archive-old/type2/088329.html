Subject: Re: [T2] primer/body filler query

I've done the former and assumed the filler would act as a sealer.

    I've always applied filler over bare metal as well. I guess it =
depends on the type of filler. Bondo (brand name) soaks up water like a =
sponge, and would cause the metal underneath to rust. However, fillers =
like Claw Glass and Metal-2-Metal are waterproof. I've had very good =
luck with both these fillers. I've seen too many Bondo (again, brand =
name-Bondo became like &quot;Kleenex&quot;, a generic term for body fillers) fail =
within weeks/months. I love it when I'm asked if I used any Bondo in =
restoring my Westy- I can honestly say you won't find a speck of Bondo =
anywhere on it-filler, yes, Bondo, NO.
