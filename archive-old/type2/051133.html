Subject: [T2] Side window seal installation.(73 Westy)

      Hi All. I've been putting the bus back together since having pulled
the engine for a repaint of the engine compartment. I extended my intended
paint job to include the rear and aft sides of the bus as there was a little
corrosion under the window seals. I installed the quarter window (left hand
side of bus in the aft window frame and am now having a H#LL of a time
trying to get the large side glass in the body opening! I warmed the seal,
lubed the frame with spray silicone but it seems impossibly tight. I moved
back to the rear hatch and its glass installed with ease.
I was carefull not to build up the window frame area of the body(sill) ,
when doing the bodywork. I just ground out the corrosion and spot filled the
remaining pits. I've already cut the inner seal lip with the installing cord
from pulling so hard! Any other tips on this one?

Also when I removed the engine I was carefull to tag all wiring for ease of
reconnection. My mind tells me there was a plastic connector the goes to the
regulator on the R/H side of the firewall.I think I may have removed it and
am wondering if that is correct.

Thanks
