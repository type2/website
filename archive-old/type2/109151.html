 Subject: [T2] another trouble first engine pull
 
 
 &gt; Since i'd started taking the engine out alone yesterday (w.out trans.) I
&gt; decided to continue on that route today.  However, after receiving
&gt; guidance
&gt; from the list and getting all four (!) bolts out, I'm having trouble
&gt; disconnecting the engine from the trans
 
 &gt; So far I've disconnected the 4 bolts, electrical, the two hoses from the
&gt; heat boxes, the accel. cable, and taken everything unnecessary off inside
&gt; the engine bay.  Am I missing anything big?
 
 Remove the starter. You may have incorrectly identified the &quot;4th bolt&quot;.
If the starter is removed, then you found it. You also won't be happy 
when those scissors jacks fall over. Put a block between them to
catch the engine when they do.
