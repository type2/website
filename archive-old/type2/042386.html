My 78 Camper is named Tennessee Jed since we bought him in Tennessee from a
guy named Elvis (really). His plate is 10CJED. The previous 78 camper was
named Pepe, not sure why. My wife's 76 bug was named Fluffhead (and sported
an awful purple below the beltline paint job over the original gold). never
named our 66 split since I sold it before I put it on the road. I had a
friend that had a Sage Green 79 and he had a bright red cover on his front
mounted spare. It was called &quot;The Olive&quot;

As for your bus, my wife spent 6 months in Spain and made some local
friends, one of which had a small orange car they called &quot;naranja&quot;. I like
the suggestion of &quot;Clockwork&quot; myself. My wife would hate it as she greatly
disliked the movie...
