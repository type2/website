&gt; &gt; Paint th ebus a different color - I noticed a TREMENDOUS difference between
&gt; &gt; the temp inside the westy and the panel - and the westy had the windows
&gt; &gt; and doors open!
&gt; 
&gt; The roof color is important!  another way to stay cool in the summer is to
&gt; install a roof rack with a sheet of thin plywood on it to shade the top of
&gt; the bus.  This is worth about 10 degrees F over a bare white roof on my
&gt; '71 (with stock headliner)

also could put something on the roof usefull, like a canoe, bonus, also
get about 1/2 MPG better gas mileage
