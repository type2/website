&gt;&gt; You need a grade 10.9 bolt

&gt;list,

&gt;for what it is worth, i just put new cv boots on my VW thing and the kit
&gt;came with grade 12.9 bolts. not sure if this is standard as i was surprised
&gt;they were that hard. the only other grade 12.9 fasteners on a bus are the
&gt;head studs. the boot kits were german made by &quot;te-gu-fa&quot;.

The original bolts are 10.9 and that's all that's required to handle the torque from the stock engine. That size/style fastener is more commonly found in the 12.9 grade which is why your kit probably came with them.
