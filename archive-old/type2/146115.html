&gt; Interesting that a computer shop has these:

&gt; http://www.surpluscomputers_dot_com/store/main.aspx?p=ItemDetail&amp;item=TOL10292
&gt; 
&gt; Some other goodies for pretty cheap too.
&gt; 
&gt; 

My local Dollar Store has 'em in plastic for $.99...

Reminds me of a cartoon I recently saw:

Buncha Asian models cavorting around a car
and the caption read:
&quot;Drive the new CHINOLET...So cheap even if
your job has been off-shored you can afford one!&quot;
