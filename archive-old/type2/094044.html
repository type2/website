Subject: Re: [T2] the right tire cover

[...]
If it is the cover i am thinking of,,it is no longer made.  the company 
that made it got handed a big licensing fee bill and stopped 
production(VW enforcers at work).

&gt; Hi everyone.
&gt; I've been looking for a certain spare tire cover to put on my Westy but 
&gt; I'm
&gt; having trouble finding it.  I want a black cover with the VW logo on it.
&gt; Does anybody know where I can find this?
&gt; Thanks a bunch.
