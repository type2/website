Subject: Some Fun Thursday

(hope your sarcasm meeter's working..heh)

Thursday I jumped in the GWB to go to lunch. (I really hate not having
anyplace in walking distance.) I got a block away at an intersection and the
bus just died. Kaput. Tach stopped registering, even when cranking with the
starter. So I pretty much knew what happened.

Hit the hazards and jump out. Yeppers. The wire running from the carb
solenoids through my distribution block and to the + side of the coil was
fried. One of the solenoid connectors had somehow popped off and was
shorting against the solenoid body.

I mickey-moused the wires to get me back to the office. After work I went
out and rebuilt my wiring harness from the distribution block to the
solenoids and removed the melted insulation from the loom.

Not a big deal, took like 20 minutes. I carry wire and connectors in the
GWB. One thing I don't have yet is a fuse on that circuit, and I think I
need one. So...

How much current do those solenoids draw? I have a HyFire and tach pulling
off there as well but I have the specs on those somewhere. (Note that I do
have a 30a relay on that circuit so all my accessories aren't being pulled
through the ignition switch.) I'm thinking 8a should be plenty, but I really
want the fuse as close as possible, so if 5a will do it that's what I want.

Thoughts?
