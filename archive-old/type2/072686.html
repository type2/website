Subject: Thrust bearing case journal width?

I'm currently building a spare 2 L. engine for my 77 bus.  I bought a
factory rebuilt 1800 engine from a railroad auction a couple years ago and
sold off the crank, rods and heads.  In inspecting the case I find it has
been line bored.  I am having a crank I took out of a '78 turned.  I see
that I need to order over and under sized bearings but I need information
on the case's thrust bearing journal width to see if it is std or
different. The current width is .866 in.  Bentley doesn't show this spec.
Does anyone have any information on this?

Thanks
