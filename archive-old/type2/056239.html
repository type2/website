I went today and bought all four Vanagon &quot;Westys&quot; the toy store had left.  

Two(2) have been spoken for so I have two(2) left.  They are Ravell/Monogram
80's era air cooled Westys.  The models were manufactured/distributed from
Germany according to the info printed on the box.

They are $ 9.99 plus shipping (which I haven't found out yet... gotta' box 'em
and weigh 'em.)

Going.... going.....
