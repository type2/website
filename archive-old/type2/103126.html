Subject: Hey!  Parts Junkies!

Hiya All,

I'd really like to get the original VW parts number for the rear glass (yes, 
it has the defroster grid) for a 1970 Bus.  Or, just in case the numbers 
changed for some reason,  any year window with defroster grid which will fit 
the rear opening.  Can any of you parts gurus supply those numbers for me?

Mike
