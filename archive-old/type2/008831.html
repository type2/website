No nead for the flame suit!  

Hydraulic lifters were stock starting in the '78.  '77 and earlier had
solid lifters.

&gt; Maybe i'm asking fot it or showing my ignorance, but aren't most &quot;type 4, 2 litre engines&quot; hyd lift? How is it &quot;obviously...solid lift...&quot; could be only the U.S. If i'm just ignorant of this, you can hit me in the head with one of these solid lifters. ;]
