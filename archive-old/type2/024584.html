I have not done it, but you could use a wiper switch off a Bug or early
Bus(like my 71), they are mounted in the dash and there is a hole behind the
pad on your dash for such a switch. I think all pre-71 VWs had a dash
mounted switch for the wipers, at least the Bugs and Buses. Get a wiring
diagram from say a 70 or 71 and wire it the same way to the switch of the
same year. They even have the hose attachment so you can still use your
windsheild washers.

Looks like my wiper switch has grown tired and will not power the motor
unless
manually held to a position other than it's normal resting position. Has
anyone
used standard rocker type (or similar) switches to bypass the steering
column-mounted unit (which is also not cheap).

Thanks in advance,
