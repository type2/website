Subject: [T2] Vac Tester for Brake Booster

Volks,
  I just read how to test the brake booster. My question is where do I hook
up the vac tester on the motor. I have a '79 FI/2.0L w/Calif emissions.
Anyway heres the problem, I replaced both rear wheel brake cylinders, bleed
the whole brake system with new brake fluid. I been driving for a while now,
but one day I decided to pump the pedal 2 times and when I did I had real
strong braking power. I don't know if its hydraulic or vacuum. The system
appears to be working. I have to only pump twice to get more braking power.
The engine idles fine, so I am guessing that maybe I have a collapsed hose
somewhere or even the check valve is broke.  Any comments or suggestions
will be greatly appreciated.
