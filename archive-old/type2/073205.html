Subject: Re: VW Locally made tools book.


At one time somebody (can't remember who) was scanning the Locally Made
Tools book in order to burn it onto CD-ROM, thence to be published on the
web. He was emphatic about the fact that he was not going to make any
copies but that one. I remember the phrase &quot;no matter what the inducement&quot;,
maybe search the archive for that.
