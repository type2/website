&gt; 2.0 motor, with a/c is in pretty good shape. I want to transfer the
&gt; engine to my 73 Westy, but I can't remember if you have to modify the
&gt; tranny.

You will have to use the flywheel from the '73, because of the different
clutch/bellhousing size used on the '73 tranny versus the 76-up.  Otherwise
it will drop in.
