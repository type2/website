&lt;&lt;  I know I could just sell it and use the money to look
for a new vehicle, but I thought I'd try here first.  Help me get back into

Get more than just a trade for a VW...Put it on ebay, but use the English
phrase, &quot;shooting brake&quot; instead of station wagon...Get enough to buy
two Vanagons...:-)
