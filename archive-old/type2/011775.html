&gt; Here in Southern California people are pretty stuck up. Big Sport Utility Vehicles are 
&gt; the IN thing. The only VW bus that is admired is the pre-1967. If it is a 21 window bus
&gt; , it is worshipped. Anything newer than a 1967, its like &quot;Why would you drive that ugly
&gt;  thing??&quot; Only us, the true VW bus fanatics know why. People here on the freeways don't
&gt;  hesitate to flip you the finger if you get on the freeway slow, or if you go the poste
&gt; d speed limit. It is a small price to pay, but VW bus ownership is worth the little &quot;an
&gt; noyances&quot;.

I think saying that about &quot;Southern California&quot; is a bit of a generalization.
True, I did get comments at work:  &quot;You bought a bus?  Yeah, all I remember
about ours is that it broke down a lot.&quot; &quot;Rick, why did Tommy buy a bus?  
Because he lives in OB...&quot;  etc.

However, I have yet -- to the best of my knowledge -- to get flipped off, 
I haven't gotten too many comments, people seem to move out of the way when I cut
them off  -- the old, I signal to switch lanes, the first car speeds
up and passes me, the next car speeds up to try to pass me, I move over
because I'm bigger, dammit, and I *signalled* -- and other air cooled
folks generally wave.  All this in a '71 bay hardtop camper in San Diego.
Heck, Ocean Beach has so many buses (bays, splits, westies) that when I wanted
to buy a bus, I just went for a 2 hour walk with a piece of paper and 
a pencil and found 3 or 4 buses for sale!  So yeah, they may not worship
you (with a bay), but i certainly don't get hasseled.

or something.  while I'm responding to all this though, i suppose i'll respond
to the initial post:  I don't mind getting waved at, I have trouble not 
waving when I'm in my CRX instead of the bus, i regularly stop (always, to date)
if i see another air-cooled VW or water-cooled Camper broken down because 
I always have my tools with me in the bus, and, I guess I don't mind the  
attention from folks.  Then again, I wave and make faces at babies sitting in 
car seats in other cars to try to make them smile...

So yeah, I guess I could see getting annoyed if i were in a cranky 
mood or if people who were obviously non-vw-heads made peace signs, but
i guess I would say, to the fear of the community being diluted by
people who &quot;don't understand&quot;, that the only way to make them understand
is to continue being the cool VW-owner that you are.  Don't worry about
who they are and how annoying they might be, just take the time and
patience to show them what the community is about.  They'll come around
eventually...
