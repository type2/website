Subject: rubber gaskets, etc.

Gentlepersons-
                       I've used a few of this company's products and have 
been quite happy
with the results. They are Metro Moulded Parts, Inc. The web site is 
                       &lt;http://www.Metrommp_dot_com&gt;
and, although they don't have as many out and out VW gaskets and seals, they 
do have
rubber in stock sizes that can be cut to size. i.e. instead of trying to cut 
up old inner
tubes or whatever. They have an enormous selection of grommets, washers, etc. 
ac-
cording to size and application.
                       And...if all that's stopping you from towing your 
Horch to the car shows
with your Bus is the luggage rack pads...They got that too.
