Subject: BROKE DOWN:  starter wires  ???

Hi all,

I am broke down 600 miles from home.  1981 Automatic.  I have several
questions.


My van will not start - the starter goes, but nothing else.
1- I had a vw shop here (that seems to know aircooled vans somewhat well)
work on my van - they messed with a bunch of wires, and some jusr came off.
QUESTION:  How many wires should be connected to the tabs on the soleniod.
I see 2 in the bentley 1 from the ignition switch, and 1 going to the air
meter.  BUT the 1 going to the air meter is is a harness with another wire
with a 'sleeve'.  this second wire is actually 2 wires crimped into 1
sleeve and is NOT connected to anything.  I don't know where it goes -
should this be on the solenoid?

If anyone doesn't mind a phone call, I'd love to talk to someone
knowledgeable.  Please call at 540-951-3102.

FURTHER READING:
My van has been broke down for a few weeks with an intermittent stalling
problem.  I came down to VA to get my van - the shop told me I just needed
a wiring harness.  I brough the harness, but that wasn't the problem.

SO to make things worse Once I made it to a good place to work on the van I
started the van and started wiggling wires to see if I could find a loose
one.  I must have knocked the wires off the starter b/c they came off.  I
put the ignition switch wire back on, BUT it won't start.

As soon as I get someone to work the ignition switch I will start to
diagnose some problems.

Thanks all,
steve
