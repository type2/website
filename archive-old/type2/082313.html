&gt; I have a type 25, 2 litre air cooled with Solex carbs, which don't seem to 
&gt; work well.
&gt; 
&gt; A.  Has anyone got any wisdom for replacing them with Webers (either twin 
&gt; 40 or progressive)?
&gt; 
&gt; B.  Anyone got any wisdom on making them work better?  Idle is poor, hot 
&gt; starting poor, not very economical and not smooth around town - but OK 
&gt; cruising on a motorway.
&gt; 
&gt; I am in London - any local experts who could set them up or supply a 
&gt; service kit?
&gt; 
&gt; I have fitted 009 distributor (electronic ignition totally stuffed) - 
&gt; anyone know the optimum the contact gap setting, and how to keep it there?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

       I am sure lots of people will advise you to replace the 009 
distributor to something with a vacuum advance the general feeling seems to 
be that the advance curve for this distributor is not suited to this engine 
in this application(its only good for racing)and would explain why its not 
good around town. I think I would try a different distributor first not 
necessarily a T25 one. A rebuild kit can be had from just kampers for the 
solex carbs quite cheaply about twelve quid each. Note If you go for the 
webers the 009 will I think have to be used because the webers wont have a 
vacuum take of point. Try the total vw website for advice on someone who can 
be of more help with setting up your carbs locally. Petronix do an electronic 
conversion kit for both the standard type 2 distributor and the 009 but I 
don't think they are interchangeable. I hope this helps. yours Mel
