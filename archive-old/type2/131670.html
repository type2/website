Subject: Part # for Sealing Ring behind Fan Hub

I am looking for the Part # for the Small sealing ring that goes behind the 
Fan Hub. Small O-Ring like the one that goes inside the Flywheel / 
Flexplate. My local Imports Vendor said they don't list one there. My (now 
Blue) Bentley shows it there and I pulled one out. I would think there would 
be a number out there somewhere or an equivilent sized O-Ring that would 
work. Anbody know this one?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
