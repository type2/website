&gt; OK so I have an extra cot that fits in the front of a bay window.
&gt; There is a young lady in northern Minnesota that has a 1969 hardtop
&gt; camper and is interested in the cot but doesn't have the brackets
&gt; and isn't sure if her year came equipped with a front cot.  So did
&gt; all bay campers come equipped with a cot or do we need to install it
&gt; from scratch?

I took a look on thesamba in the manual section at the closest
campmobile docs. it says (this is a 70 not 69) that the Childrens
hammock w/ storage bag is std equipment. so if the 69 is the same as
the 70 and it is a westfalia camper bus it should either have the
mounts for the cot or holes where the mounts were. Its also possible
she doesn't actually have a genuine campmobile?
