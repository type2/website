Subject: Re: wiring - generator

actually, the old wire did that too, but then upon putting in a much larger 
one, it didn't show up for quite some time.  while i'm at it, i yanked my 
voltage regulator, by request from list members, and cleaned off the points 
or whatever you call them.  i've never heard of the company that made the 
vr.  all it says is:  F.D Product, F.D Japan, Furuhashi Auto Electric Parts 
Co. Ltd., DNW240/12-1, and stamped on the base is 12V.  should i just 
replace the regulator. i haven't had time to throw it back in yet to see if 
it worked.  maybe tomorrow if the girlfriend isn't too angry at me, i can 
get to do that.  TIA
