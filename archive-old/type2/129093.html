Subject: Re: [T2] why I drive a buses

Do you know about the hot springs along Rt 12 out of Missoula (beyond
Lolo)?...I bicycled across country in 1984 and really enjoyed camping
there. .Followed the Lochsa river towards Kooskia; they were on the left
side.  Really cool views of the evergreens along the river; reminds me
of Kyoto Japan.    In 95 we followed that route in our 78 Westy camper
and found the same hot springs.
