Subject: Re: [T2] Left rear shock....

Troy said:


Hey all, my Bentley is on the loose somewhere in my garage Muir didn't help
much.  This is in relation to a 78 Transporter we just picked up.  Since I
picked it up , I have noticed a knocking noise from the rear when going over
larger dips or bumps.  I got it up on jacks last night and found that the
bolt attaching the shock absorber did not seem to be in all the way.  I
tried to tighten in but its not wanting to go anywhere and I am afraid to
put too much pressure on it.  It's pretty scary though realizing how I was
driving it. Should I be able to really ratchet down on this or are there other items I
should look into?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The upper bolt is long. It goes thru the frame rail. In the fuel tank cavity, there are 2 weld nuts
[one on each side] for the upper shock bolts. Either the bolt threads are stripped (unlikely) or the weld nut
has a problem (highly likely). 1st I would try to remove the bolt and see if it is damaged.
If the threads are OK, them you have a problem. You need to remove the access panel across the gas tank to get
to the nut. You cannot replace the weld nut. You could possibly find a longer bolt and add a 2nd nut lock nut,
but 2 things are wrong with this:
1) if you want to change shocks later, you will need to remove the gas tank panel to get to the nut
2) the rear corner of the gas tank is about 1&quot; away, too long a bolt will puncture the tank....

Your other option is to remove the shock completely and drive the bus without it.
