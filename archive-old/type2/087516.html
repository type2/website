Subject: free tent?!

yesterday i was in my front yard splitting wood. woman from down the corner
rolls by to drop something off at the neighbor's. over the fence she asked
me if i wanted her cedar stump, and i was indifferent, but made mention
that her 78 westy  - sold to the vw shop for $150 - well, i'da bought for
that for more; that it was dearly de-parted and in line at the crush pile.
she said it was a hard luck thing. trees falling on her house from the wind
storm, too much to deal with, mortgage tightness. i told her if she needed
any help with anything to call me first.

today she returned with the westy's tent. apparently the vw shop feller
hadn't paid her in total, and she knew tents were valuable. she liked my
offer to help. however, it is missing the hardware!  where do i begin with
that?! psykt!! - steve
