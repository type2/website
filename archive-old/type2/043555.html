Subject: More wiring questions

Q1.  There's this black wire with a VW inline fuse running from the firewall
to nowhere on the drivers side of my 72 1700 engine.    It has a female
connector on the end and comes into the engine compartment with a few other
wires which go to the coil.  Any guesses where it should connect to?

Q2.  How does the fuel gauge work?  My gauge reads ok when the tanks full
(it shows it as being over 3/4) but when the tank gets down to around half
or less, the gauge jumps around, pegging both ends, frantically.  It doesn't
seem to do it as bad when the car is on but not running.  Thoughts?

Thanks for the help!
