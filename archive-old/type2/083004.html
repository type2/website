Subject: 1800 TypeIV w/dual solex carbs for sale

Hello,

I have an 1800 TypeIV engine with dual solex carbs for sale.  It was running
when I pulled it about a year ago.  I pulled it to install an engine I had
done a top-end rebuild.  I have three complete motors, and do not need them
all so this one is up for grabs.  It has been stored outside wrapped in a
tarp.  I need the space it is currently occupying, so the sooner the
better.  

I won't ship the whole engine, so it'll have to go to someone local who is
willing to stop by and get it.  I am in Portland, Oregon.

$75 OBO

Happy trails,
        brandy
