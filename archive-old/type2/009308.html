&gt; As most of you know, I am planning on travelling cross country in my
70
&gt; Westy. I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to mount a motocycle
to the
&gt; front or rear of my bus. I appreciate any and all replies :)
&gt; thank you

&lt;&lt;Look for the tire hanger mounts that bolt to the bumper.  They
consist of a
bracket that mounts to the bumper and an oval welded to the bracket. 
Once the
mounts are fastened to the bumper, you lift up one side of the motor
cycle at
a time and set it into the oval.  You may need to unbolt the handle
bars to
keep them from going through the rear window.  Strap the wheels to the
mounts
and strap the motor cycle to the bus.  Put some rubber or foam between
the
motor cycle and the bus [keeps the bus from hurting the motorcycle ;-)
]&gt;&gt;

This might work for a _very_ light motorcycle (like a moped), but I'd
think twice before putting anything heavier on bumper-mounts.

I used them for a 220-pound motorcycle on a Ch*vy van and bent the
Ch*vy bumper!
