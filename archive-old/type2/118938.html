Subject: Rust proofing/undercoating

So I'm thinking about taking my 78 to one of the rust proof places to get
that oily stuff sprayed underneath.  There are a few different shops around
that do that sort of thing.  There is a Krown place locally and a Rust Check
and I'm sure there are a couple of others.  Does anyone know of any reason
why one shops rust prevention oil chemical would be better than the others.

TIA
