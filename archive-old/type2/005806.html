&gt; If both are right hand, I believe
&gt; Mercedes split clamps will work on a Vanagon....they are half the
thickness
&gt; of bays.
&gt; I will check tomorrow.

I have good news and not so good news......
The good news: Yes, Mercedes split nuts will fit Vanagons with no problem.
They are part # 116 334 03 72. They fit 116, 123, 126, 140 body MB's...just
about all but the 107 from 72 up.
The not so good news: Mercedes is VERY proud of them.... they have a
suggested list price of $19 each!!!  And they do not come with the 5mm
headed allen bolt, that's extra...
But 116 and 123's are all over the wrecking yards here. I can get lots of
the split nuts if anyone wants a pair. Both sides are right hand thread like
a Vanagon, they won't work on the left side of a split or bay bus.
