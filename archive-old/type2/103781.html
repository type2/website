Subject: Re: [T2] [BP] What is this-Is it a compressor??

OK, OK, please don't send any one over here wearing white suits carrying
butterfly nets, but..............................and I know this is
wild......................Is it a two cycle engine?                 Like all
of us I have been looking at this and tiring to decide if its a Chinese mild
lock or some other warped trick or???????????????

     I don't have the answer, but only more questions:

1) I don't see any valve train!

2) Where is the exhaust system?

3) All of that electrical system, and no spark or glow plugs.

4) Where is the fuel system?

5) If there is combustion, where is the cooling system?


    Look closely at the base of #2 (on a real Volkswagen engine anyway), is
that an exhaust &quot;gap&quot; at the base facing toward the rear? About 150 years
ago I used to fly model air planes, and the engines were two cycle, with
glow plugs, and the exhaust would exit at the base of the cylinder. This
would explain some of it, but not all.

Well call me crazy, but at least I'''mm  nooot as think as yor durnk...

Please let me know where to pick up the prize money if I'm right.

Happy Friday!!!!!!!!!

&gt; Since it's Friday, I thought I'd challenge the list geniuses to try to
&gt; figure this picture out. It looks to me like a homemade compressor, but
why
&gt; would it be in a Bug? The more I look at it, the more confused I get. Look
&gt; at the electrical apparatus in there. It looks like too much work to be a
&gt; dummy, lots of wires etc.
