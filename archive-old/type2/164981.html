Subject: Re: [T2] Hill Climbing Temp

It is a 1977 Westfalia with a very accurate speedometer, which leads me to believe that my tires are the correct diameter, this matters a lot when it comes to torque.

I usually shift from 3rd to 4th at about 52-53mph when accelerating, like on a freeway onramp.

I think I could run up hills at 50 mph in 3rd but I like 45 better, it sounds like a tractor working hard but not like a VW getting driven to death.

I do not have a CHT gauge.

The reason I ask, and I should have asked about 50 in 4th versus 45 in 3rd to be more accurate, is because I only would assume that 3rd would be better because it is moving more air, but without having tried it with gauges how do I really know, I was hoping that somebody had data or could get it.

These speeds are based on 2 adults, 2 125 pound dogs, and 3 days worth of car camping gear, by myself I could cruise at 60 in 4th up the mountain with an occasional downshift to get me back to 55, it runs really well.

Thanks,
JM

&gt; It depends on... Incline, throttle position, year, transmission, 
&gt; engine, mods, etcetcetcetc. 
&gt; 
&gt; For example, in my 78, 4th at 1/2 throttle doing 45 wouldn't bother 
&gt; me. My 73 would have melted down under the same conditions.
