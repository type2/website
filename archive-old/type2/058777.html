Joe,

I have personally had  bad business dealings with Kevin.  I sent
him money for parts 18 months or so and after much chasing
and promises never received said parts or a refund........and
I believe this is why he is now a 'former' list member....

I am a reserved person and generally very careful about what I
say about others, believing in the maxim that if you can't say
anything good don't say anything at all.  Kevin seems like 
a really nice guy, but as I've said before I don't know about his 
business practices -  I am not sure
I would be spruiking his business on his behalf...
