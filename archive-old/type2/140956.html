Subject: Re: [T2] Changing axle

From Messa, Corbett:

 I have never changed an axle on a bus before. How much work is involved? I am looking to purchase the
complete axle from BD. Can someone give me some feedback on this. Bentley makes is sound pretty easy. Anything
I should know before I start? I have a 73.

Piece of cake...... IF you remember to clean out each Allen head bolt with an ice pick first.  If the Allen
socket is not all the way to the bottom, you will round off the bolt. Then it is vise-grip time.... real
Vise-Grip brand, not Chinese wanna-be's.

6 bolts on each end. Remove them and the half-moons under each 2 bolts.

Did I mention to clean out each bolt?
