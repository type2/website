Subject: Re: Typical bus weight

I rolled real slow over a scale (kind of an innocent path out of the
recycling yard - so as not to have to pay to be weighed), and it varied
between 3,300 and 3,400 pounds. This is with a '69 Westy with me (180
pounds) in it, and 3/4 tank of gas.

We all know that air is 14 psi per cubic inch at sea level, so if you let
all the air out of the tires, the net weight of the bus would be close to
145 pounds.
