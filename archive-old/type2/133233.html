&gt; Looks like the tranny in it is a 030.. and I guess it wasn't the best

&gt; The shop is going to look for a 010 and see what can be found. Does anyone
&gt; know of any that are around.. hopefully in canada? And what price we may
&gt; be looking at?

think $250-400 CDN for a good working 010, might luck out and get one
cheaper and anything over 400 better come with a good warranty
