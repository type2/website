72 bus..Well anything aircooled..I've seen corvairs and have owned a 80
vanagon with  a 911 six cylinder.....(had to cut out for the oil tank, tho)
Any type 4 engine will fit..but the shrouding, duct work, exhaust and fuel
systems will have to be worked out....to get the maximum power from like a 2.0
bus or 2.0 914 engine you will need to retain the fuel Injection system on the
motor...and that involves swaping tanks and mounting control units
etc.....Please remember no matter what VW unit you choose, you will not have a
road burner...your average Aerostar will suck the headlight out of your 72..I
drove a vanagon with a 3.5 liter Rover V-8 ( I have sick,*sick*, friends...)
and even at 185 HP it was just &quot;OK&quot;......
As an example..a 2.0 bus engine.._dot_using your heater boxes and mufler along
with the carbs and flywheel  it will bolt in..but you will have lost some of
the power of the 2.0 due to the restrictive carbs and exhaust....The Vangon
2.0 will fit but the heads require that you use the vanagon heater boxes which
reqire the vanagon shrouding wich may have to be modified to fit..etc......
Buick V6? hang the radiator on the front bumper? you dont *have* to cut it up
to do this....Rolls Royce Merlin or a Pratt&amp;Whitney PT-6 .....now *they* might
require some body mods....  ;-)
GIve us a choice and these folks can &quot;Yea&quot; or &quot;Nay&quot; it...
My personal choice would be a 1971 411 &quot;W&quot; series with the FI system..85 rock
and roll HP...
