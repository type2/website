Subject: Re: [T2] brake help needed!

Get a 1/2&quot; breaker bar and the correct size socket. I think it's a 19mm 
,but not sure on the size.
It's much safer for you and the bus. Those cross shaped lug wrenches are 
junk. You can't get safe leverage and they take up a lot of room.

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;Ok, I am finally getting around to doing my brakes and wouldnt you know it,
&gt;I cannot for the life of me
&gt;get any of the dang lugnuts to start loosening up. When I had this random
&gt;shop give me an estimate a month back, they must have just gone nuts with
&gt;the airpowered gun and they are essentially welded in place it seems.
&gt;
&gt;Should I run buy one of those cross shaped lugwrenches, so I get more
&gt;leverage and hopefully then will be able to bust them loose, or do I need to
&gt;wait till tuesday to find a shop someplace with an airgun where they can
&gt;break them free for me?
&gt;
&gt;Jeez, if I had a flat tire I would be screwed. Or maybe the shop was made
&gt;that I said I think I would rather just not have them do the work afterall.
&gt;
&gt;any thoughts on this are appreciatted.
