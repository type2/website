Subject: wanted: 69 brake fluid reservoir

i had a good one from the boneyard, and when i applied a liitle pressure it
cracked and crazed like a 30 year old piece of ... plastic. are these being
reproduced - don't see it in the catalogues? if anyone has a good spare,
i'd like to trade or buy it. i can swap a to-67 round one, or a 68 one year
only reservoir.  THANKS, steve
