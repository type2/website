Rob:

POR-15 paint won't seal actual holes, but they do have a floorboard repair kit that makes use of POR-15 paint, a special fibreglass cloth, and epoxy putty.  See the POR-15 website for more info and/or ordering.

&gt;Hello listees,
&gt;
&gt;I know that this has been discussed, but I probably wasn't paying enough 
&gt;attention at the time as I didn't know I had a problem.  
&gt;
&gt;I have a specific question and need some advise.  I went to get estimates on 
&gt;painting my 72 bay window bus and found that I have a rust hole in floor of 
&gt;the front passenger side of the bus.  It is where the floor starts to round 
&gt;up towards the seat and is rectangular in shape, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch wide 
&gt;and 5 inches long.  Will POR15 work for this type of rust?  If so, should it 
&gt;be put on the both sides of the floor?  I have some other rust areas about 
&gt;the same size, but the rust  has not gone completely though yet.  It will be 
&gt;about $300 for the 3 areas that need work if I have the bad sections cut out 
&gt;and new ones placed in.  POR15 sounds cheaper, easier and more rewarding if I 
&gt;do it myself.  Any help is always appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Rob :-)
