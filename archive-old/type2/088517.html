Subject: Re: [T2] removing generator

&gt; Before you disassemble anything, disconnect the battery ground strap,
hold the
&gt; pulley with a screwdriver, reach around in front of the shroud with a
36mm socket
&gt; and a 6&quot; extension on a ratchet and loosen the nut big nut.  If the
wrench is 
&gt; pointing straight up push it to the right side of the bus to loosen!
Reach in 
&gt; there and carefully unscrew the nut, keeping track of the washer and
shims behind 
&gt; it.  Put interference stop and figure it out, don't force anything!

Note that if the fan nut was torqued on too tightly in the first place,
this procedure might be completely impossible.  The first time I tried
to remove the fan nut on my bus's engine, I discovered that the
generator pulley (which, we recall, is trying to turn against the blade
of a large screwdriver) will most definitely break when you apply more
than 100 lb-ft of torque to the fan nut in an attempt to unscrew it.  I
then took the whole mess, broken pulley and all, into a machine shop and
watched them roll their eyes, then remove the nut effortlessly with an
air wrench.

As a complete novice, I have no idea how common this is.  Still, don't
be too surprised or disappointed if you can't get the fan nut loose with
a ratchet.  And don't be afraid to take it to the nearest garage with
five bucks to have someone take the nut off with an impact wrench.  It's
cheaper than a pulley.
