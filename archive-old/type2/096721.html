Subject: will a 79 2.0 go into a 75 bus

--part1_ba.2b3abe00.2a9fb33d_boundary

Hi Again the valve seat in the wifes 75 appears to have dropped.  I may have 
found a 100% complete 79 2.0.  However rememberr reading that the exhaust 
ports are different.  I read on aircooled_dot_net something about adapter or 
spacers 
Thanks
Ray 
ps anybody got a good used engine?
