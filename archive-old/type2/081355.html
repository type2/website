Subject: [T2] Kadron Rebuilding


&gt; I am about to embark on the rebuilding of my dual
&gt; kadron carbs on my 74 1.8. If there is anybidy who has
&gt; done this in the past who has any does and don'ts or
&gt; tips I would be most appreciative. Does anybody know 
&gt; of a manual for the kadrons, I would like to keep them
&gt; on for at least a year until I can afford to do the
&gt; engine rebuild and new carbs at the same time.
&gt; TIA
&gt; Tyler
