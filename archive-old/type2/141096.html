Subject: Re: [T2] air fuel ratio monitor

You can build your own for cheap. Use a O2 sensor (3 wire is best) and do a
quick scan of the internet for home made air/fuel plans. There are a no. of
plans for them. CB Performance sells one already put together for WAY
cheaper than that. Basically all they do is read the voltage coming off the
O2 sensor you've put in the downside of the exhaust system. As an O2 sensor
reads oxygen, it gives off a certain voltage. You can actually hook up a
sensitive voltage meter to one, and get your readings from there. There is a
scale of voltage readings that relates to air/fuel mixture if you do a
google search. I built one for my 160HP Type 1 2276, but haven't finished
the engine (lost interest), to see how it is.

&gt; It looks like it runs $300.. and the cable length will be a bit short for
a
&gt; bus..
