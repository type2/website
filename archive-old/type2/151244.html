Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS rescue---Engine runs fine, but dies when the
  engine is under load.

Hi Mike,

Sounds like it's possibly a fuel flow issue or an ignition problem.

It might help to set the valves (with the engine stone cold) and then  
test compression, just to confirm what's going on with the valves.  
Once the compression is known the other useful measurement is  
vacuum... you should see 15&amp;quot; at idle. If it's dropped a valve seat or  
burned a valve it will run fine on flats but poorly on hills, though  
the coughing and sputtering don't fit that possibility much.

Fuel flow will be hard to deal with, because I suspect some debris in  
the tank could be blocking the fuel outlet. A fuel pressure gauge  
will help determine if the problem is fuel related, someone needs to  
watch it as the bus goes up a hill. If the fuel pressure drops then  
you have your culprit. The fix for this is to remove the tank and  
shake out the debris. It's a PITA job, you either have to lower the  
engine or pull all the FI components in order to get the tank out.

It could also be the coil... I have had a coil that only failed under  
high load conditions. That's a 10-minute swap if you have a spare  
available.

Good luck with it,


Happy trails,

&amp;gt; Got an A.I.R.S. rescue here.  We're in north Seattle, about a mile

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; My bus is dead. Quick lowdown: 77 Westy with electronic ignition.  
&amp;gt; She'll
&amp;gt; start beautifully, idle beautifully, and drive just fine on the  
&amp;gt; flat or
&amp;gt; downhill but as soon as I'm driving up a hill, she misses, coughs, and
&amp;gt; eventually dies within 10-20 seconds. I can get her to keep going if I
&amp;gt; feather the clutch and gas, letting both on and off and so on, but
&amp;gt; eventually she dies no matter what.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
