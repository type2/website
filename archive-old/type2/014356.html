Subject: 69 overhead storage

On a 69 Westy, is there supposed to be an overhead
storage shelf as well as the cargo net or is the cargo
net the only storage? Either one or is the net just an
option to accompany the shelf? I have the net but no
shelf. What is the appropriate configuration? Thanks,

Doug
