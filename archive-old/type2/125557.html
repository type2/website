Subject: Another FI Trivia question

Hi Volks,

What's the &quot;baseline&quot; adjustment for the idle (Air Bypass) screw on a 
throttle body without a full throttle sensor switch?

I know that the usual setting for carbs is two turns back from all the 
way in. But  I was wondering if there's a similar starting point (so to 
speak) for the FI idle?


Happy trails,
