Adam,
at your local auto parts store for a few bucks you should find a little
gadget that looks alot like a spark plug but has a spring loaded clothespin
style clamp on it. If you get one of these pull the wire off whatever
cylinder you want to check hook up to the tester plug, clamp it to a good
ground preferably the block but I think the tin works too( make sure you can
see where the spark will be jumping). have a friend turn over the engine
while you watch. it works best to do this at night or inside with limited
light.so you can see it better.  You cando it with just the spark plug but
htis way is much easier

Lood Gluck,

  Mickey
