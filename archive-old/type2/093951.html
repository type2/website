Subject: Re: [T2] electric fuel pump.

[...]
The cheaper type pumps are not &quot;self priming&quot; and will need to be set 
below tank level.  With rotary type pumps it is critical that they dont 
try to pump air for very long. In fact the only self priming pump i 
have seen associated with a vw is the  pump on the gas heaters.

&gt; i have recently installed a rotary/electric fuel pump .. 3 1/2 lbs of 
&gt; fuel
&gt; pressure .. do these pumps suck gas from the fuel tank or do they use 
&gt; gravity
&gt; to get the gas and then pump it out to the carbs?  reason i ask is i 
&gt; mounted
&gt; the fuel pump in the top of my engine compartment.. should this be
&gt; acceptable? thanks for the help.. scott
