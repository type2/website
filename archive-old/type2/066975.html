    ME TOO!!   I assume that VW no longer has the European Delivery program
of old ( does anybody out there know for sure?)  I have heard that there's a
market in London where VW busses are sold every Sunday? or so for folks
wanting something to tour around Europe with,,,, then you can go back there
before leaving and sell the bus back to someone.... Has anyone out there had
any experience with this or know any more info. about it??       PINK
