Subject: Transmission Mail Order?

Hello Listees,

It's been another bad news day :-(

The tranny is officially shot in my '74 Bus.

Wondering if you guys could reccomend a  good mail order tranny or should I go
for the local rebuild at $695?

Also, what is the opinion on Freeway Flyer vs. Stock?

Thanks,

Tom
