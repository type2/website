Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck valves and promises

Thomas,
When the rotor is pointing at cylinder 2, it's actually cylinder 1
that's firing!  Then when it's pointing at 1, it's 2 that's firing; 3 is
3 and 4 is 4.  The 1 and 2 cables are flipped!

There is a groove marked on the metal distributor housing (with cap
removed) that indicates when the rotor is in position to fire cylinder 1
(doesn't necessarily indicate TDC because the distributor may be
turned).  That mark should be pointing to the back right (passenger) or
5 o'clock.

normal config:

3    ______     1
    /       \
   | 3     2 |
   | 4     1 |
    \_______/
4               2

or with a flipped drive dog:

3    ______     1
    /       \
   | 1     4 |
   | 2     3 |
    \_______/
4               2

               
Now, you may have a flipped drive dog, that would make your distributor
180 degrees off.  But not 90.  If it's 90, something's wrong.

Also make sure that your distributor is seated completely.  It should
lock in nicely, and when seated correctly, the rotor will have a little
bit of play but feel solid.  This &quot;play&quot; is actually the spring action
of the centrifugal advance.  I usually spin my rotor and push the
distributor down until I feel it lock in.  Then I push down on the
distributor casing to make sure it's seated nicely.

And if you're wondering, the drive dog will only fit in one way.

&gt; &gt; Make sure that you have the rotor pointing the correct direction when
&gt; &gt; you're adjusting the valves.  When it's in firing position one, the
&gt; &gt; rotor should be pointing out of the back of the engine compartment, to
&gt; &gt; the right.  If you're unsure if it's actually at TDC, just stick a long
&gt; &gt; screwdriver in cylinder 1 and feel the piston as it moves up and stops.
&gt; &gt; Then go adjust 1.
&gt; 
&gt; well, funny that.
&gt; 
&gt; so, I managed to free the valves (followup on that in a second), but
&gt; the engine is still running 180 degrees out!
&gt; 
&gt; scenario:  71 bus, 1600DP, vacuum advance dizzy (popped it back in as I figured
&gt;                                                         out the issue with it)
&gt; 
&gt; 1. confirmed TDC with screwdriver
&gt; 
&gt; 2. rotor points towards to 2:00 pm (towards the FRONT (FIF) of the bus and to the
&gt; right) at #1 -- doh!!!
&gt; 
&gt; so i guess I moved the dizzy drive shaft around 90 degrees somehow when
&gt; I was swapping dizzys, but how???
&gt; 
&gt; curious.
&gt; 
&gt; mike, thanks for going through (confirming) where the rotor would be
&gt; in terms of a clockface.  it really helped (as in, my predicament finally
&gt; sunk in).
&gt; 
&gt; ideas on how i broke this (and how i fix this) appreciated -- i'm off to hit
&gt; Muir and Bentley for a solution.
&gt; 
&gt; go go gadget type2 list!
