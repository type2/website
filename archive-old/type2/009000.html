Any suggestions on oil cooler mounting for 81 Vanagon

I bought an oil cooler (Kymco with thermostatically controlled fan) and
now ready to mount it - it is recommended that I use an adapter that
replaces the oil filter - the oil lines come out of this then feed into
an remote filter mount and then feeds into the oil cooler.   It is
recommended that the oil cooler be mounted above the transmission -
protected and the electric fan creates the necessary air flow.

Anyone out there who has mounted an oil cooler in an Vanagon? - it
appears that there are more places to mount the cooler or a remote filter
in a loaf.

Any suggestions for the remote filter location - my engine is out now, so
it's hard to recognise.
