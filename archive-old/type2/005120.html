Subject: Mountain passes in NC

Volks,
2 weeks ago I conquered Old Fort Mountain on I-40 in NC in my 81
vanagon............looked for a t-shirt stand at the top and definitely felt
like some sort of gold star should now be worn on my cap!  Took at at 45 MPH
in 3rd gear...........7 mile 6 % grade.............

I thought Saluda grade was bad on I-26 ( about a 3 mile 6 % grade) but Old
Fort puts it to shame!!!
