Subject: T4 thermostat and flaps

Hmmmmmmmmm
I have been looking my engine over and I am not sure if I
have a thermostat and flaps. I know where these are located on
a T1 engine but I am not sure where to look on a T4.
If my engine is with out themostat and/or flaps, can these
be replaced with the engine in the bus? 

On the Gas heater thread, i sure would love one, but $500-600
is quite a bit. Kathy has the Steward Warner and I have heard
others talk about the BN4, can anyone clue me on what the
advantages and disadvantages are associated with each brand?
Thanks...
