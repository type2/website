I agree, there has to be a better way to install the canvas.  If you look at 
the new EuroVan Weekender, or even the later Vanagons, the canvas can be 
installed from the bottom up.  Instead of the top being stapled first, the 
bottom is put in place and the top has a metal trim piece that covers up the 
staples.  If I ever put another canvas in my bus, I'm going to make my own 
trim so I can put it in this same way.
