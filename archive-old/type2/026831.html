Well, I just ordered from JustKampers.co_dot_uk, this morning, so it's kinda 
late now, but thanks anyways. I guess I'll find out. They didnt say if they 
were from Veng or not, but I didnt ask. If they don't fit well, I'll have to 
try to make them work, because it will be plenty of money to ship them back 
to England from the US. They did say they were stamped, so hopefully a floor 
will be hard to screw up. I wont be putting in bus seats, just camper seats 
and camper equipment, so Hopefully the fit won't be as critical, since alot 
will be covered.  I'll let you all know how they work so they next guy will 
have more heads up than I had. Thanks for all the info anyways.

Dave,
If you can get the Brazilian panels, I would say go for it.  I got a pair of 
Brazilian front wheel arches (doglegs) in '97.  They are well made and fit 
perfectly, unlike the Veng version that I bought first and had to send back 
because they were so poorly made, with ripples everywhere and ragged edges.  
It may be that the company that bought Veng are doing a better job, but I 
doubt it if they are using the same tooling and selling for the same price. 
The panels that Schofield makes are also very good, but I think he tends to 
make small repair sections and parts that are not available from VW. I can't 
comment on the parentage of the Just Kampers panels.
