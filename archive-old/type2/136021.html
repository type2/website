&gt; It turns out that the camshaft lobe for #1 and 3 was no longer eggshaped,

&gt; John assumes this was due to an overheating issue he had on the way to a 
&gt; campout, due to a misconnected vacum hose. They fixed it at the campout, 
&gt; but apparently the damage was already done.

I wonder if the lifters were ever swaped out or changed and somehow
managed to put a hardened lifter w/ a not so hard cam?
