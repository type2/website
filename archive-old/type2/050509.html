Subject: Acceleration woes

Dear listees,

  I have a 74 dual-carb bus which has developed a rather alarming problem over the last seven days. When the gas pedal is depressed the enging revs climb.... then fall off .. then climb again, with accompanying backfiring (very loudly), especially when in second gear. I first noticed this on the freeway last weekend when at a smooth 65mph there was a momentary loss of power as if someone had cut the throttle cable, although within a second or so the power returned. This situation has got progressively worse throughout the week, to the stage where even applying revs in neutral causes the engine to cough , splutter and backfire. This happens whether power is applied by the gas pedal or by myself turning the throttle bar in the engine compartment. The engine idles fine, however. 
  Today I performed a slightly overdue tune-up: oil change, valve clearances reset, timing was reset at 8 degrees before TDC as opposed to 10 degrees after (on the advice of a VW mechanic of great experience) and the  idle speed and carb mixtures were reset . The engine idles a little smoother now but as soon as the gas pedal is depressed the aforesaid symptoms are still there. I've come to the conclusion that the problem is fuel feed related, I've checked the fuel lines for blockage and they're clear, there is no crud in the filters, and the engine idles great so fuel is getting through OK and thus the mechanical fuel pump I've got is working (correct?). The archives have pointed me towards the accelerator pumps on the carbs (2/3 PDSIT which were rebuilt by a shop about 4000 miles ago), not an area I've dealt with before myself. Sooo....
  Can the accelerator pumps be adjusted and if so how? Have any of you with a twin carb bus had these symptoms, and if so then what was the solution? I'd like to solve this problem myself but I'm off on holiday on Friday and need to get the bus running well by then. All help is received with a smile.
