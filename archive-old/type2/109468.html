Subject: Re: [T2] Window molding insert

I bought new plastic moulding ~2 years ago. Not sure of the manufacturer
though.
To the best of my knowledge all window rubber moulding for Bay bus's (both
original and replacement) is plastic with aluminium foil inside for the
'chrome' effect.
All old Beetles and Bus's had the moulding as aluminium only. Easily damaged
and I don't think available anymore (never chased it though)
