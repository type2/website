Howdy all,

Anyone have a P22 'Basic' model Westfalia Vanagon?  This model has the
icebox (read: cooler) instead of fridge, no stove and a slightly different
layout than the deluxe inside.

I have a 1980 in which the PO had disconnected the camper accessory panel
(more on this later).  Now, on deluxes I've seen from the same year, the
accessory panel has a toggle switch that provides power to the panel and
sink pump.  Mine has no switch.  Not even a hole for a switch.  If I connect
the panel wiring, the power is on at all times, even without the key in the
ignition, which is why the PO had it disconnected.

I know that I could install a switch without too much sweat, but I wondered
if anyone could help me understand how this works.  I have no Camper manual
(PO didn't have it - anyone have one to sell?), and my Bentley only has the
wiring diagram for the deluxe configuration, so can anyone help me out?  I'd
like to keep it fairly stock.

Also, is there a stock replacement for the circuit breaker?  The toggle on
mine was gone when I bought it.
