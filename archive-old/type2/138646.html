Subject: Re: [T2] Prices for a valve job?

&gt;From: Mark Hineline

&gt;I submit that this is a rare occasion. I take advice from you guys very 
&gt;seriously. I could probably make a list of things a mile long that I have 
&gt;chosen to do because you recommended it. But you've got it wrong in this 
&gt;case.


Along with that advice they listed places where he could get an engine. Also 
you said yourself it would be wise to get to know the engine. He has 
limmitted mechanical skills, sounds more like they are not seasoned to the 
type IV, yet. But he could spend the same paying the extra for the needed 
tools he might not poses and buy a rebuilt engine from a reputable vendor 
and get away from the GEX. Live long, live happy.
