Hello Listers:

I hope all of you had a very nice Memorial Day, and that we all remembered why we observe this holiday (Americans, anyway).  

I have been in the process of building my first VW engine, a 1600 DP for my 71 bus.  The plan was to get it all ready, and install it this past weekend.  Everything went together pretty well, and I got to the point where the engine was done, and all that was left was putting on the tin pieces.  I put on the pulley tin, cylinder shrouds, and type 3 cool tins, problem-free.  I put on the thermostat bracket, bellows, and rod.  Now here come the problems.  I look at my brand new doghouse fan shroud, and there are no mounting holes for the thermostat flaps.  Major problem.  I also notice there are no holes for mounting the coil.  Not a huge problem, but quite inconvenient.  I move on to the rear apron tin.  The mounting holes for all the sheet metal screws just don't line up with the holes in the cylinder shrouds or the pulley tin.  Also, the shape isn't quite right.  Bottom line is, it won't fit.

I purchased these parts, along with most of the engine pieces from a place in Sunnyvale, CA, called Bugformance.  I know I could have gotten almost everything cheaper from the typical internet and mail-order sources, but I decided that since this was my first engine build, it would be better to buy from a local shop that seemed to know what it was doing, so I could ask questions when I ran into problems.  I sat down with the manager of this shop while he looked through the Bugpak catalog, and picked out all the tin pieces I needed, and ordered them.  When I called this morning to tell them the tin pieces didn't fit, all he could say was, that they use these pieces all the time with no fit problems, and that I'd have to bring the engine to them so they could see why the apron tin didn't fit.  As far as the doghouse not having mounting holes, he said that none of the after-market doghouses had holes for the thermostat flaps, and that they never put the thermostat system on engines they build at their shop.  He said they weren't really needed.  I told this manager that the reason I bought all my stuff from them was so I could get some advice and guidance from them, and I made it abundantly clear that this was my first engine build, and openly solicited advice from them throughout the building process.  He told me that they weren't in the mind-reading business, and couldn't answer questions I didn't ask.  Of course, this answer was highly unsatisfactory to me.  Now here's the best part:  I painted the tin pieces to match the color of my engine bay, so I can't return them.  I guess I should have looked at them more closely before I painted them, but this is a mistake I won't make again.  I also won't make the mistake of buying anything from Bugformance in Sunnyvale.  There's a Bugformance in San Jose, CA, that isn't affiliated with the shop in Sunnyvale, and I'll continue to buy stuff from the San Jose shop.

So, the bottom line is, does anyone out there have a doghouse fan shroud that will fit a 71 bus with 1600 DP?  Original, not aftermarket?  With mounting holes for the thermostat flaps and coil?

Thanks,

Jim Hood
