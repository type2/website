Subject: Re: [T2] 77 bus won't stay running and whisteles

&gt; you have to check for a vac line that is off.... probably the hose to the 
&gt; brake booster... or the large ones on the decel valve, or the S tube on the 
&gt; intake. 
&gt; 
&gt; when the back fire occurs,, the hose might pop off... this prevents damage 
&gt; to other components.. put it back on.. and your back in business.. 
&gt; 
&gt; if the backfire occures again... check to see why 

I put it back on and it is still running rough, it took 2 blocks to pop off again.

I haven't checked the timing yet, but I am wondering how easy it is for a little pop to turn the distributor, is this common?

Thanks
