Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Nuts - Copper Nuts are not copper!

&gt; One additional thing to consider with regard to the nut material for
&gt; exhaust:If you use the copper nuts, and they get rounded or just plain
&gt; stuck, they are by far the easiest to get off using a chisel.

The exhaust nuts vendors refer to as &quot;copper exhaust nuts&quot; are not made of
copper - they are copper plated steel. They are quite hard, will not round
off at all. The are self-locking which is important as the torque on these
is quite low.
