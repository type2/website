Subject: Re: [T2] Rust Bullet

Here is another rust preventative product you guys may want to check
out.

It's SEM Rustsheild.
I have used it on frames of Mack Trucks--pressure wash and paint.

It comes in a bunch of colors---and is an excellent high gloss rust
blocking spray paint.
Sprays on with the consistency of tar--and lays out glossy and smooth
when it dries.

The fleet of trucks I applied the stuff to the frames, still remain
glossy--and have no rust reacurring in 3 years so far.
Fills the rust pits really nice--and I'm really impressed with the long
term results--no rust whatsoever--

Pretty reasonable too---

Another product that seems to be bullet proof is made by Dupont--it's
not in the automotive division--but they can get it---

It's a spray epoxy industrial paint--that requires a catalyst---it dries
to a semi gloss finish-and you can hit this stuff with a sledge hammer
or chisel--try and file it off--it doesn't move one iota.

This would be excellent for the under carriage of any Bus or Van for
long term corrosion protection.
And it's cheap--like $39.00 per gallon--and the hardener is the same
price--cover's like crazy--and sticks like glue--

I use this stuff on low boy trailer's where machines have a tendency to
tear up the paint on the way onto the trailer--the paint doesn't move---

Just some more ideas---


Later,
