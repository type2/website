Subject: Newbie w/ Q about brake servo vacuum line

Hi all, I've been posting questions over at RAMVA for a few weeks. I 
recently acquired a 71 Type 2 with a new (3,000 mile) 1776 engine.  I've 
never worked on cars before, though I watched my dad tear apart and 
rebuild a couple MG TD's when I was a teenager (I'm 53).  I am an 
electrical engineer by trade.

I've been cleaning up the various messes the PO's have left on this car. 
One of the first things I did was have the centermount Weber carb 
removed and dual Kads installed. I pulled off an old A/C core from the 
bottom of the bus. I'm re-doing bad wiring, etc.

One thing I've discovered is that the vacuum line for the brake servo is 
apparently not connected at the engine end. The brakes are really good, 
so I'm not complaining, and it might be more trouble than it is worth to 
drill and tap and set things up for vacuum. If that's the case, I 'd 
like to tidy up the hose end in the engine compartment.

I'm curious about a little thingy on that line. I know that there is 
supposed to be a one-way valve on the line, but this thingy might not be 
that one-way valve.

I have posted a couple of pictures at

and if anyone recognizes the thing, please advise!

Thanks!

Mike  Elliott
