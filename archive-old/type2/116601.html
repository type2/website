Subject: RE: [T2] Mechanic In Vegas (Was in Mechanic In Long Beach)

&gt; After much scouring I have found another Ghia that suits our criteria
&gt; according to the seller and am looking for someone to provide me with an
&gt; unbiased opinion on the car. This car is located in Las Vegas. Any help
&gt; would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Glenn

This wouldnt happen to be a white '62 would it? I have a friend selling
hers.

There are a few shops here in Las Vegas.

Personally, I have taken my Bus to the Beetle Barn. They charge $63 to check
out the car (engine, brakes, etc). They take a while, since they are rather
busy. They are on the east side of town near the air force base.

There is also a small shop called the Pit Stop. It is hard to find but I
have heard good things from the local VW club. They are on Valley View Blvd,
near the Rio hotel (where I work).

Let me know if I can help anymore.
