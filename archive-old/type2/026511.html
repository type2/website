&gt;63 crewcab apart and i was checking out the gas tank area down 
&gt;there behind the passanger bench....ALOT of room down there! has 
&gt;anyone thought about putting a bigger tank down there? has 
&gt;anyone done it? 

My 58 single cab has a 15 gallon tank from a 68-71 bus.  Fits in there just
fine with plenty of room on all sides to spare.  You have to get/fabricate
some longer tie-down straps.
