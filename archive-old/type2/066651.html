Yep, started back in what like '66 or something?  Someone better
than me would know but seems like I might have read that splits
could even come with dual sliders late on (but I could be way way out

I've seen 4-5 in person not counting at shows, and one has been
listed for sale in HMN for a while.  Yet another incredible
90's Minivan invention though of course.  Oddly I've never seen
a Vanagon with them though they did of course exist, simply haven't
seen one myself.
