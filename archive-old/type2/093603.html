Subject: Re: [T2] died half way on trip

Personally i have never  known a mechanical fuel pump to go intermittant 
like your describing. I would look for blockage either in the tank or 
the lines.  There  also is  an explanation that might make your 
mysterious intermitant pump. Was the gas tank fuel level (relative to 
the fuel pump) different  on the two  different tries?  If  the level  
was higher than the pump then you on the try that works you may actually 
be just getting siphon activity and the pump may actually be bad.

&gt; 73 Bus, single carb ..mech. fuel pump.
&gt; Well it died in Indiana so I jumped a wire from the battery to the coil 
&gt; and it ran fine until I reached my friends house in Springfield 
&gt; Illinois. Well within 5 min. of it anyway. This time it would not 
&gt; start. So we unhooked the gas line before the fuel filter he watched 
&gt; well I turned the key. No Fuel.
&gt; again. No fuel.
&gt; We towed it to his place.
&gt; ried it again and fuel poured out.
&gt; So do fuel pumps work speradicly sometimes on there way out?
&gt; And where do I find a tool to remove those odd star shaped bolts that 
&gt; hold the pump on?
