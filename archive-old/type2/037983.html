Hey Joel,

I would take it to a professional installation shop.  Something like Circuit
City or Sound Advice.

I recently had a stereo/tape deck installed in the dash with several
speakers and a cd changer under the sofa.  They did a great job.  Very
professional.  Everything looks like it belongs there, sounds great, and is
guaranteed.

Darrin.
'74 Westy (Bess)

&gt; Bought a nice radio w/cassette at COSTCO for $60 with two speakers. It
&gt; was slightly larger than dash opening in my 70 van. I hand-filed bottom
&gt; of opening to remove an eighth inch or so and squared corners of
&gt; opening. Fits fine.

&gt; &gt; can anyone give me some info on installing an aftermarket radio in a '74
Westy? I would like to use the stock dash radio opening, however the opening
is a little small.  I need to make it wider &amp; taller.  I have tried using a
file, but that's just too slow.  Any ideas on the easiest way to get that
opening the size I want it without tearing up that nice original dash?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, I have seen the under-dash type radio holders advertised in lots
of places - but I have only seen these for bugs.   Is there a place that
sells them for buses? I guess my only other option would be installing the
radio in the glove box...any hints/ideas/tips are much appreciated.
