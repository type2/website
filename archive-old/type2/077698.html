Subject: Re: [T2] oil additive advice

ARoman4047_at_aol_dot_com sends:

&gt; Pretty sure Dupont went to court to have their name removed from at
&gt; least one of the snake oil ads

The story I read said DuPont was asked by the snake oil manufacturers to
sell them Teflon for use in the snake oil. DuPont said no, Teflon doesn't
belong in motor oil, we don't want your product damaging Teflon's good name,
no Teflon for you.

The snake oil manufacturers took DuPont to court. DuPont lost--once you sell
a product, you can't tell people what to do with it.
