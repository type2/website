Isaiah wrote &quot;It had become one (by means of total and complete
rustation) with the shifter base.  The PO must have gotten mad at it
some time or another too because my gearshift lever was
bent/twisted....&quot;

I just recently had one that came with the RMMW kit break on me; and I
wasn't even mad.  The metal looked like pot metal, where it cracked,
near the ball.  FWIW, RMMW honored their lifetime guarantee (two years
later).

&quot;Does anyone have a good shifter base/ stop plate/ lever/ spring that
they would sell??  It has to be free of major rust...
I know the kit is cheap...but better to use stuff off of another bus
than to buy brand new...its good for the karma!&quot;

I'd put my money on good used parts.
