 Hello everybody
 Is it possible to test a starter before installing
 it?

A: yes if it is a self-supporting auto trans/ auto
stick starter.

 Also, if I have a 79 bus with auto tranny. will a
 starter from another year with a manual tranny work?

A: NO, you HAVE to use a self-supporting starter on a
auto trans bus. You cannot use a manual trans starter.

You can use the self-supporting starter on 1.7 and 1.8
engines but you cannot use it on the 2.0 with the
228mm flywheel.
