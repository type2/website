Subject: [T2] VW Gas Fired Heaters-Was staying warm
Content-Disposition: inline

I have heard of these VW Aux gas fired heaters, but I was hearing that they are too dangerious.  Who knows how educated my source was on these items, but...  I would be interested in hearing more about these.

Where can I get one for my 77 T2, and how safe are they?  What am I looking to spend as well?

&gt;I have a 78 and put in a VW aux gas fired heater,  I stay warm, now
