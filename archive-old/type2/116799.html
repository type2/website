Subject: Re: [T2] DIY Paint

-What kind of paint did you use?
-Roller or Rattle Can?
-How much paint was required?
-Did you prime first?
-What about the poptop? Same stuff/technique?

I did the white first, cheap spray cans....and yea, sanded down all of the 
rust first and primed it before i painted it. if you have any rust at all, 
you want to get rid of it and prime it, otherwise rust will come back alot 
worse.

I did the blue this past weekend and used rustoleum from the Home Depot and 
put it on with brushes and it turned out great, you can hardley tell i used 
a brush, it only took a small container, i think it must have been a quart 
but i'm not sure.

I left my poptop alone, except for using X15 or whatever to clean it, if you 
are going to paint it, find paint that is meant for fiberglass.

I went the cheap route but the best way to do it is with a sprayer and 
professionial auto paint, but I didn't have the bucks to do that.
