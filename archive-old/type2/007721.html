&gt; Does anyone have a copy of How to rebuild VW by Tom WIlson that they

I have a feeling that Tom Wilson would be less than pleased with this!

It's one thing to reproduce an out-of-print book or manual.  It's
quite another thing to bootleg a book that can be had at the local
bookstore.

The pictures in the original book will be much nicer as well!
