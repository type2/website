Subject: Tinted rear and side glass for sale

Hi, All.

I had three pieces of glass made for my '79 (two rear sides w/o vent windows and rear hatch). They are 3/16, light smoke grey and tempered. I've already installed them and they fit perfectly and look great on my newly painted blue and white Kombi. 

The company I got them from called me up today and asked if I had already picked up my glass, and &quot;yes&quot;, says I, &quot;they are already installed.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; says she, &quot;there are three more pieces, apparently we ordered them twice by accident. Do you want them? You can have them at our cost, otherwise they'll be thrown out.&quot;

I thought someone else on the list could use them, so I'll go ahead and pick them and offer them up for sale. $175 for all three, plus shipping, if needed. I'm in Alameda, CA 94501.

They look great, not so dark you can't see through them, just a nice grey. Real classy. There is even an aftermarket window defroster for the rear available here

that I plan on installing on mine.

I also have an abundance of other pieces of flat glass (original) if anyone needs it. Some is tinted with that awful purple stuff... you'd have to scrape that off.
