Hello all,
Please kill this thread.  The list is for Bus content only.  If you have
difficulties with sending/receiving list mail, please notify the on-duty
admin at type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com.  Do NOT post that kind of thing to the
list.

All this information and more is contained in the charter you received
when you subscribed to the list.  In case you didn't save/read the
charter, Ken Hooper thoughtfully posts it to the list once a week for your
benefit.
