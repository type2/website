Subject: [T2]Push Rod Tubes Stuck, Help!
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi All,

I'm in the process of changing some push rod seals on my '72 Westy with a
1800 (pancake). I have everything out but I can't seem to get the push rod
tubes to budge! I don't want to damage the tubes. Any tricks or secrects
you could pass along to me for getting them out (I'm a woman so pure
strength won't work!)? I'd rather not have to go out and purchase a special
tool for this either. I'd like to get this job done so I can enjoy the rest
of the weekend! 

Thanks so much for your help.  I couldn't do all this without you all!
