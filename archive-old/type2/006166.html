Actually don't need..but would like to have a throttle positioner for my
bone-stock 71 SC (1600 DP). I'm not usually a resto-freak, but this vehicle
is so complete/original that I'd like to complete this system. It has the
altitude correction part..that mounts in left of eng bay. It may work.
Missing the part that mounts on the carb itself. Anyone have one lying
about?

Thanks, Marv Krupp
