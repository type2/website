&gt; I'm just getting tired of
&gt; changing them every year or so.  The Carters are

&gt; they make is the 4070 at 4 psi.  Too much?

Hey kevin  I am rying to figure this out  I have ran these pumps for years  
,one in my 67 bug going on 17 years , also one in my 66 westy with the FI case 
that has no place for a fuel pump for it seems like ever  never have one fail  
I have been using the Facets and purlator types.    If you do run the carter 
I would use a regulator with it.  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
