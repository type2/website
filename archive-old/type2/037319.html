Subject: Cyl Head Temp question (and a little Fri content)

I put a VDO Cyl head temp gauge in my bus a few weeks ago.  I had to lengthen 
the supplied sending unit wires about a foot to get the length I needed (and 
believe me, I routed it as directly as I could)
 The gauge reads a little over a hundred degrees when the bus has been idle 
for a few days in about 50 degree weather.  I'm figuring that it is reading 
about 75 degrees high.  (This is OK, I figure, because it's all relative 
anyway) 
Now for the question:
Can I expect that this 75 degree discrepancy holds all the way up the scale?  
That is, if it reads 125 degrees at 50 degrees, will it read 300 degrees at 
225, 400 degrees at 325, and so on?  Or will the difference between actual 
and indicated temperature get progressively smaller or larger?
The gauge reads between 350 and 400 degrees at highway speeds, but it hasn't 
gotten very warm here in West Virginia yet.
I checked the archives, but I couldn't find out much about this.

Also, (since it is Friday) I wonder if anyone in the South (Georgia, Florida, 
the Carolinas, Alabama, Arkansas, etc.) could refer me to a favorite salvage 
yard in their area that might have a not rusty 1971-1976 Pontiac wagon 
(Catalina, B'Ville, GranVille) that they would sell or part?  I'm looking for 
a good rear clip, among other things.  I'd buy a whole car if I need to. 
Or does anyone know where one of these big boys is parked in someones yard?
Can anybody help?
Sorry about the non-VW content, but I've been looking for these parts for a 
long time and I'm running out of options.  Besides, when it's finished, the 
big wagon is intended to transport non-rusty VWs from the south and west back 
up here to eager buggers and bussers (or is that busers?).
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Greg 
West Virginia
