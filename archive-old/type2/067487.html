A Puzzler that listies will KNOW!  If you didn't catch Car Talk this
morning, they'll have the Puzzler listed over on http://cartalk_dot_com. 

So, how many of you know *exactly* which three bolts were involved in the
flaming demise of a Beetle in this week's Puzzler?

Although they had their normal disparaging remarks on AC VWs, they did give
the Muir book some credit with enabling their &quot;mechanically challenged&quot;
friend to some quite extensive work on the Beetle...
