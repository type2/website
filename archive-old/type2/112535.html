Subject: Re:Starter?

The starter says 100% brand new (not reman) on the Bosch box and it did come 
with a new bushing. It also came with a new Hecho en Mexico stamp. But I was 
mainly concerned with the last letter being an &quot;N&quot; instead of an &quot;X&quot; as on the 
Advanced Auto parts website.
