&gt;  1. I use to think it was because of longer trips that this problem would

&gt; the other day.
&gt; I got in the Bus. Turned the key and not one sound. Nothing. So I rolled it
&gt; backwards downhill and pop started it. Drove it back up to the top, turned it
&gt; off, tried again and it started on it's own. What is up with that? whenever it
&gt; has done this in the past it is the same thing. And once it happens it might
&gt; be months before it does it again.

   Sounds like there's a burnt spot on the starter commutator (where the
brushes ride) and when the starter stops at that spot, it won't go. Or
else one of the brushes is sticking in its holder, keeping it up off the
commutator. Or the solinoid could be sticking. Same thing either way --
the vibration of the engine running moves the
commutator/brush/solinoid/whichever enough to let it work next time.
It's also possible that you have a loose connection somewhere, but I'd
bet that you need a new starter.
   One way to &quot;fix&quot; it if you are stopped somewhere without a hill is to
crawl under with a hammer and whack the solinoid and starter a few times
-- helps if someone else is turning the key at the same time. 
   One other similar scenario is if once and a while your same situation
happens, but you hear the starter &quot;whirring&quot; but the engine doesn't
crank, then either you have a missing tooth on the flywheel, or the
solinoid is too weak to push the Bendix mechanism (is is called a Bendix
on German starters? 8-&gt; ) into contact, or the Bendix itself is
sticking.
   Hey, it's easy enough to figure out -- pull the starter out and take
it apart. Sand down the commutator, clean all the little grooves with a
screwdriver tip, put in new brushes, and put a dab of grease in the
bushings at each end. Oh, yeah, that's another possibility -- the
bushing could be shot in your tranny, in which case the starter gets
cocked a little and won't go, but engine vibration gets it uncocked so
it works the next time.
