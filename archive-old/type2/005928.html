X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

[...]

This prompts me to once again give thanks for the simplicity and
_serviceability_ of our beloved Type 2s.  Despite their alleged shortcomings
and frailties, they can be repaired beside the road with simple tools and
[relatively] inexpensive spares.

Case in point:  I just the other day replaced a bad rear axle bearing on a
1983 AMC/Renault Alliance.  The bearing is a double-row _sealed_ roller
bearing.  Impossible to service or maintain, just wait 'til it dies and
replace the bearing.  The bearing is pressed into the drum/hub assembly, and
a machine shop press is necessary to R&amp;R the bearing.

To my further surprise and dismay the axle/hub nut is an aircraft-style
nylon lock nut, with no other provision for retaining/locking the nut on the
axle.  The factory specs call for this nut to be replaced after removal,
except the nut is an odd size and NLA.

Imagine having to deal with this bearing by the side of the road somewhere
in the wilds of N. America!  I'm now informed that VW uses a similar
arrangement on some of its watercooled vehicles.  Ah, progress.....

&gt;&gt;  Driving on a bad wheel bearing can be very costly (ask me how I know).
The bearing may really overheat and weld the race to the spindle (a HUGE
ordeal to replace).  &lt;&lt;
