Subject: RE: [T2] 68 rear drum - what will interchange

'68 were originally one year only because of the backing plate.  Dealers
were told to exchange these '68 only drums and backing plates when the
busses came in for service.  It wasn't a recall but the result was the same.
What you need to find out is if you have a '68 backing plate.  If you do
then you need a '68 only drum.  The problem as you might guess is that
because dealerships were doing this replacement for free by VW guidelines,
if you need '68 only drums they are hard to find.  You might need to do a
&quot;dealership&quot; switch with your backing plates.
