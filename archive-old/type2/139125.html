Subject: Re: [T2] Diagnose a Fuel Injection Pump wiring problem

&gt; Can anyone lay out the steps to diagnose a fuel injection pump not working.
&gt; I have already proven that the pump is GOOD!(I ran a temporary (+)and(-)
&gt; lead to it and it went on)

You could also see if it's drawing an appropriate amount of current: 2.5A -
3.5A

&gt;But with the key on and the cover off the AFM, I
&gt; should be able to hear the Fuel Injection pump go on and pressurize the
&gt; system, when I move the dial inside the AFM.  This does not happen.  So is
&gt; it a wiring issue? Fuse somewhere?

The double relay activates the pump via the AFM switch. Check those
connections.
