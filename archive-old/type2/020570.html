theoretically the vapor barrier should stop (or prevent to an extent anyway)
the foam from absorbing water, the foam also shouldn't be as bad as the
original fiberglass insulation as it is very dense, but it is a good point.
Neoprene sounds like a great material as an alternative as well separated.  i
also agree with your statement about the &quot;great stuff&quot; i used it very sparingly
only in a couple spots where the material between the braces and the sheet
metal had   AS with most things though there are significant trade off's here,
all this sound proofing is heavy and hurts gas mileage, and of course may be a
catalyst for rust.
 those pedestal rubber mats are hard to find in good shape..im on the lookout
for some decent ones myself
