Hi Tom,

I replaced my seat belts with retractable ones about 3 years ago and really 
like them. I purchased them from JC Whitney. The retractor bolted to the mount 
between the seat and door, the upper end bolted into the top mount. The inside 
mounts bolt right in as well. Took about and hour to install both sides.
