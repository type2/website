Subject: Re beadbreaker &amp; flying objects

Gee, reminds me of the time I visited a friend with a steep paved
driveway- Took along the plastic ramps with the waffle bottom (kinder to
asphalt)-Tried to level the Westy by driving onto the ramps and one
slipped out (coated asphalt) and shot across the road!  We cut pieces of
old carpet with the carpet upside down under the ramps and that worked. 
Me, I'd jack up the rear wheel by the lower shock mount, then let it
down onto the tire lying flat under it.

&gt; Warning, if the tire on the ground is not positioned properly and you
&gt; drive too fast, it will snap up and hit the side of the car.
&gt; Sometimes on difficult tires, I stood on the outside of the tire and
&gt; added a little leverage.  It was just enough to keep it from rising.
&gt; 
&gt; Picture someone doing this for the first time, not having the correct
&gt; placement or speed down, Bubba standing on the outside of the worked on
&gt; tire, when it flips up launching Bubba up and over the car and into the
&gt; neighbors next door swiming pool.
