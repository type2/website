Subject: .. A holley carb question

My 1700 (73 Sportsmobile) has a (single) Holley carb. 
Is the general sentiment for those the same as the
Weber?  
I was told by one guy that it was the same as on some
Pinto engines.  I've had trouble finding a filter and
ended up grinding the rubber off down to the metal of
the one I found to get it to fit.

I think I might be in need of a rebuild, so parts
references ande tips beyond holley_dot_com would be
appropriate. No motivation for FI or dual
conversion..or conversation..read the list.

Very little power after getting in gear, then after a
bit (3-6 seconds?...seems like an eternity ;-)) get
power gush and if I haven't lost enough speed can
accelerate. A friend described it as a &quot;flat spot&quot; and
suspected the carb. It has mostly sat for the last 5
years. New plugs/points/gas-line/etc. and timing by
local expert last fall before storage.
Seeing the recent dizzy discussion got me a bit
concerned it might be that. I sure hope not.

- Dean
