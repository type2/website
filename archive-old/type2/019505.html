Dear Matt,
	As I have asked the list for many answers to my sunroof questions,
so I now reply to you with hopefully a way to answer your questions about
the sunroof.  I am currently in the process of finally putting mine back
together after it has been out all winter.  Believe it or not, the roof has
not leaked a bit since I removed it and replaced it with a piece of thick
plastic!  Anyway, soon I will have the sunroof back and working better than
before.  There are two main areas with having a happy sunroof:
	1. Are the drains working, or are they clogged?
	2. Is the roof and cables lubricated properly?

1. There are four drains for the sunroof, which are designed to drain away
any water which accumulates in the sunroof so that it does not come
cascading down on the back of your neck when you make a quick stop at a stop
sign.  They are located at the four corners of the compartment.  Two at the
very front of the opening and two directly above the engine compartment
accessible through the rear engine air vents.  Both sets need to be
unclogged regularly, with a wire or a high pressure water jet.

2. There are two cables which control the sunroof, which slides along two
aluminum tracks.  Both cables need to be good and lubricated for it to work
properly.  One of the problems is that the cables can get damaged because
they are not lubricated enough.

One thing that will considerably improve the performance of your sunroof is
to remove all the hardware (Bentley gives good instructions) and clean
everything (and I mean everything, including 20 years of accumulated pine
needles, etc in the sunroof's cave), lubricate it and reinstall it.  It will
give you a chance to examine all the components to see why it is giving you
trouble.  Some of the places could be in the cables themselves:  Are they
kinked?  If so they will not slide easily.  Is the gear that pulls the
cables worn?  The bad news is that if you need new cables, the cables are
not manufactured anymore.  If you are lucky (and I was) someone on the list
may have some to sell.  But once the slider works, you will be glad of it.

BTW:  Insulation tape works great to seal the sunroof, with out the mess of
caulk.

Good luck,

	Peter
