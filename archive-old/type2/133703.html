Subject: RE: [T2] Westy Seating Question

&gt;	I am trying to figure out how many can sit in a Westy, And I am
&gt;trying to make up my mind on if you get more in a 74 - 75 westy, than a
&gt;68 - 73 and  76-79.

Don't forget to think about quality as well as quantity.  I have had my 1978 
Westfalia now for about 3 years, and have never once used the refrigerator, 
sink, or stove.  I dont even know if they work (well, I know the stove 
doesnt).  When we camp, we almost always use the Coleman 2 burner, a big 
jug of water with a spigot, and a cooler, especially when we camp where 
there are picnic tables.  That being said, the swivel front seat and the two 
fantastic beds are simply wonderful.  However, I have camped in two other 
busses (both early to mid 70s 1600cc busses, but I dont know the exact 
years) that had the drivers side rear facing seat, the booth style table, 
and a big rear seat, and those were the busses that people tended to hang 
out in.  The booth style seating seems to make people happy.  The '78 is 
more open, but the others were far more cozy.  Also there was a cabinet 
behind the passenger seat with the most useful little flip out table on the 
side of it.  Those were the interiors I was looking for when I bought my 
bus, but the power of the type 4 engine won me over in the end.  My dream 
bus has the booth interior, the swivel front seat, a 2165cc type 4 (or 
2270cc while Im dreaming) engine with a top access hatch, and the great 
late bay pop-top bed.  I guess I could convert, but you know, its not THAT 
big a deal.  Happy hunting, and if you learn to cut and weld well, it opens 
up a whole world of good cheap busses.

Later!
