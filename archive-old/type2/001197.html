I am well into my sound proofing my 71, 7 passanger bus. It once was a hard
top camper  and got converted back by the PO.

We (my son, daughter and I)  did the engine compartment first.  I sprayed
rubber undercoat (4 layers) first  the glued some bubble/foil insulation
throughout the engine compartment. Replaced the cardboard roof of the engine
compartment with sheet metal. And filled a bunch of spaces with Great Stuff.

The only thing that bothers me is the foil insulation.  I wonder about a
sheet coming unglued and getting stuck in the fan. Particularly the large
piece in te front of the engine compartment.

Next was the interior. I did and reccomend that you do the passanger
compartment first and the move on to the drivers section. Or vice versa.
Projects can get overwhelming. About the time I was getting pooped out, I
was finishing.

Here's a couple of ideas/thoughts/

1.  I got a deal on some heavy rubber door mats. (1.5 FT X 2 FT) for cost
($4.13)  I got 36 of them.  Glued them with contact cement to the roof Sides
and floor.  The headliner had been replaced  with panels that screwed out
making it alot easier.The panels are covered with vinyl no underpadding . I
don't know if the door mats are as good as Q pads  but I am happy with them.
BTW glue them smooth side to the inside of the bus.  It makes applying the
Kool PAtch easier.  I used Kool Patch, don't know if other roofing cement
would do as well or not. Did two coats all over the place.

Used a combination of bubble foil insulation and pink insulation in the
walls and roof.
(Retaining heat is not the problem in South Louisiana, but I put it in for
the sound deadener effect.)  On the pink insulation  I got R13  but it was
too thick  .  I had to seperate it.  Also I used the kind that had the paper
vapor barrier already on it.  Some of the seperated insulation was used in
the walls, and I plastic wrapped it after.

I used the NASA foil insulation on the floor (not the bubble stuff).

I then replaced the panels which had low pile looped carpet on them.  I was
origionally going to add felt pad and fabric covering for more of the sound
deadening, but decided against these.  I think the carpeted walls and floor
will do fine.   The carpet had felt and two layers of rolled roofing (tar
paper) already.  This went back on the floor and rear deck.

I filled all kinds of spaces with Great Stuff expanding foam.  This stuff is
a mess and potentially damaging.  It slightly dimpled the sliding door. I
squirted foam into the bracing of the door.  You can't tell how much has
come out.  If you don't do enough, it does no good. If you do too much it
can expand more then anticipated and have now where to go, there by bulging
the sheet metal of the door.

DAP makes a latex version of this stuff.  It does not over expand. It stays
the consistency of a marshmellow.  I cant say how effective it would be for
sound deading or if it being latex would it accelerate rust. I don;t know.

Well we had our semi final exam. WOW!  It makes a heck of a difference sound
wise. (Keep in mind I don't have air conditioning).  With the windows up at
highway speeds we get a constant low road noise. You really don't hear the
engine.  Shifting thru the gears you hear the engine higher whine, but it is
much deminished.

The big difference is from it being an empty tin can while under remodeling
to now.  If you have never ridden in a bus totally stripped  you ought to
try it and hear how tinny, rattly, loud it is.

We will cont on with the drivers area.  We probably will use the Q
pads/Dynopads for the doors and front due to the tighter work space.  Also
will finish with under coating. I will probaly use regular roofing cement( A
friend has a 5 gal bucket left from a roof job).

I am more of a style guy then mechanic. This is my best part.

I hope this may be of some use to some one.  More later when finished with
the whole project.

BTW  I appreciate this list.
