Subject: type2 CD &amp; misc...happy friday, everyone.

I've set aside some disk space to begin collecting non-copyrighted
material for a big type2 archive (possibly CD, possibly something else).
I'd be really interested in getting stuff from all of you to add to this.
How would people feel about:

- - all of the text (model number info, faqs, etc.) we can get
- - pictures of every possible kind of bus we can find
- - pictures of parts so we can tell what people are talking about
- - maybe we can get VW to let us scan in owner's manuals?
- - as much of the type2/vanagon stuff as we can get
- - anything else that seems like a good idea

At this point, the one thing I'm going to say is that the archive I
collect is going to be distributed on a not-for-profit basis.  This is
both by personal choice and by the fact that using our network connection
to support a for-profit venture is a no-no.  If there are big problems
with this, then somebody else can set up the archive.

*begin geek tech talk* 
The question of format also comes to mind.  There
are a ton of choices. At this point, I'm leaning toward straight-text for
information, jpegs for photos, and gifs for diagrams with HTML &amp; text
indexes.  That way anyone with basically any computer that can read a CD
or a tape (I can write 8mm, 1/4&quot; cart, 9-track, or QIC) can make use of it
and Arena/Mosaic/Netscape/Internet Explorer users can have all of the
pretty pictures right there with the text.
*end geek tech talk*

It just occurred to me that when I talk about my Bus to
non-mechanically-inclined computer people I get pretty much the same looks
that I get when I talk about computers to non-computer-inclined bus
people. :)

If you have stuff to contribute, you can do the following:

- - small items (less than 250k) can be mailed to me at:
        tgpt_at_pas.rochester_dot_edu          (internet)
        TGPT_at_URMUV1                     (bitnet, limit is 32k per message)

Note that some mailers restrict message size; you may not be able to mail
items larger than 32k.  Also note that you must UUEncode or Binhex binary
files (pictures, etc.) before mailing.  If you don't understand what this
means, you should probably get in touch with me before emailing a picture.

If you have larger items (or lots of smaller items), please send me a
message first and I'll set up a drop point for you to leave them at.

That's it for the archive-related stuff...

So, has anyone else noticed that there's something about busses that
prompts people to cut us off in traffic?  I don't mean just making the
lane change a little close, I mean pulling out in front of a vehicle
that's moving 45mph and then accelerating slowly, unable to hear the
stream of curses from the driver of the aforementioned bus as they lock up
a 24-year-old braking system, spill kool-aid all over themselves, and have
a generally un-mellow bus driving experience.  I mean, the thing is BRIGHT
FUCKING ORANGE!  *And* I always drive w/ my lights on.  *And* it's
probably about 7 feet tall!  *And* it's as old as I am.  You would think
that this combination of factors would prompt people to avoid pulling out
right in front of us.  This happened to me twice the other night in a 5
minute period (though the second time I had already spilled the kool-aid).
Perhaps I should fix my horn.  Perhaps I should look into that underbody
rocket launcher.  I realize that a lot of it has to do with the fact that
it's *far* too easy to get a driver's license in the U.S.; we don't need
cars with better safety equipment nearly as much as we need tougher
driving tests and people who actually know how to operate a motor vehicle
in traffic.

Ack.  I'm ranting.  I'm going to go now.
