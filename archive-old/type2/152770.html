and pour  it on your driveway (or other paved surface) until it evaporated...
not so  great for the environment, or for you personally if somebody walks
along  the sidewalk smoking a cigarette.

intentional testing has revealed that dropping a cigarette on spilled  
gasoline does not light the gas on fire.   You can even put out the  cigarette by 
pouring gasoline on it.  
 
You can burn old gas in a VW.  dilution (like 1 gal/tank) is good, as  old 
gas runs hot.   so save it till winter when you want the heat  better, do not 
pour it in when you are about to go on a long road trip with the  family, 3 
dogs, and stuff piled on the roof rack on a 100 degree  day. 
 
I prefer the round bodied carbs, as they are less finicky.   A  30-pict or 
28-pict seems happy for many troublefree miles.
 
  You can leave old gas in a 5 gallon bucket (w/lid) for parts  washing (use 
nitrile gloves).  eventually it will evaporate. 

 
keep an eye on the fuel filter for a while, carry spares... there always  
seem to be some particles left in a tank even after I flush it out.
