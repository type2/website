&gt; Well, I had the new torsion arms installed but I still have a slight  pop on right turn.  I know my steering box is history.   Steering has been loose for a while.  I'm a bit finacially  embarrased right now as I'm between jobs and I just spent a wad on the  arms,  clutch, and a few other things.  Does anyone have a  used one that might get me by for a while?  And will it just  unbolt from the bottom?  If so, I'll put it on myself.  I  don't have much of a place and few tools to do anything serious.   Thanks....KR

Don't give up on the steering box until you check the drag link and swing
lever.  I was convinced that my steering box was toast and it turned out
that the drag ling rod end was bad.  Pop, clunk. Pop, clunk...
