Hey Bob,
As far as I know there was only one white for the 70 Westy.  I'm not sure of 
the code # or name. Maybe lotus white or ivory.
I have used a generic touch-up paint in a little 1 oz. bottle with brush 
that is a pretty close match.  Made by Plasti-Kote Import Color, VW-Audi, 
#3300.  This was bought at a local Kragen Auto Parts. AKA  Checker or 
Schucks or Auto Zone in other locations.  I've seen other brands that look 
just as close as this one.

Since I had the bus painted a couple of years ago I've used a can of 
touch-up paint supplied by the shop.  This was a really cheapo paint and 
body job.  The new color was not perfect but again, pretty close. At least 
close enough for me.

Your New Bus looks really original from your pictures.  NICE!

&gt;OK,
&gt;All you fellows out there with 1970 Westy campers in the white color.
&gt;Was there more than one white ??
&gt;
&gt;What &quot;generic&quot; white off of the shelf paint (either bottle with little
&gt;dabber, or spray)  have you found and used successfully to cover up
&gt;dings and chips?
&gt;
&gt;If there is more than one white involved here, I guess I will need to
&gt;give you more info as to what white I think my buses have.
