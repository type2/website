Subject: Aux battery charging question

Hi Volks,

Riddle me this:

I have a '78 Westy champagne edition. The fridge was dead, so I pulled it 
out years ago to make room inside. I replaced the aux battery charging 
relay and hooked up the charging system again, since the PO had removed 
it. I kept a deep cycle battery as aux battery and used it occasionally 
to jump myself. I have thought of hooking it up to the bus's interior 
gadgets with a switch, but never have. I don't run a lot of energy hungry 
toys anyways, so there is little need. I recently left my lights on and 
needed to jump the main battery off the deep cycle aux battery, but the 
aux battery was dead. It's about 5 years old, so maybe it was time. Sears 
automotive tells me the battery is dead and needs replacing. The primary 
(2 years on a high end Sears Die Hard) was discharged, but fine.

But I wonder: the aux battery gets charged and charged and charged, but 
never discharged or used at all (2 jump starts in 5 years). Is this bad 
for a battery? If I replace it, will this regime kill my new battery in 
time as well? If you always charge, but never use a battery, will that 
cause any problems? Hydrogen emission, or plate degradation, or boiling 
over (I think this happened- I found what I take to be acid on the top 
and in the tray). 

What would be a good way to approach this situation? It's an automatic, so
push starting it is not an option. I'll certainly have an aux battery along
when I go to remote Baja spots, but I'm not planning any of those for the
forseeable future. I could disconnect it sometimes and let it slowly run
down, then hook up again and allow to recharge. It has been suggested that I
should not replace the battery and should just never forget and leave my
lights on, and that's a good idea, but not very reassuring in the long run.
I'd rather count on a &quot;safe fail&quot; system than try to accomplish a &quot;fail safe&quot;
protocol. 

Tell me about batteries, those who know.

Drive safely,
