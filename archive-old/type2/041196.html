Subject: Shock fitment problems?

   Hi volks,
   Wondering if anyone in the bus world has ran into this?
Went to the local Autozone to get front shocks for my 69 bus. After helping 
the kid look them up ( he had no clue what a type 2, or a transporter was) I 
went home with a pair. When it came time to replace them, I got the old ones 
off with no problem- but new ones would not bolt on.  Problem was this: Top 
goes right on over hardware- but bottom doesn't. The lower shock mounting 
&quot;stud&quot; is bigger in diameter than the steel &quot;sleeve&quot; in the end of the shock. 
    I took the shocks back to the store, explaining my problem. The counter 
guys tell me that I just have to remove the steel sleeve from the end of the 
shock- exposing just the rubber bushing. Does this sound right to anyone?  If 
it is right, any tips on removing the steel &quot;sleeve&quot; without killing the 
rubber bushing?  It appears that the sleeve is glued to the rubber bushings. 
Half the reason for replacing current shocks is because the rubber bushings 
are worn out. Or maybe I have the wrong shocks? 
    Thanx for any help.
