Hi Oh All Knowing Ones
Thanks for advise with regard to rear visibility from inside rear view
mirror but I still dont know how to remove it from my 83 Vanagon air
cooled! I want to add a spacer or repace the mirror so that I can see
something to the rear other than the road. It appears to be permanently
fastened somehow. no screws in sight. Also te antenna is loose and there
does not seem to be any access to tighten it from the inside other than
removing the whole inst. panel.
Please help Oh All Knowing Listees
Thanks, Jack.
