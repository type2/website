This month's VW Trends has an interesting ad... err... featured 
supplier, on page 12. West Coast Classics is going to start producing 
sleepers for the bug, Ghia, Squareback, and Bus. The one shown for the 
beetle looks like those from the &quot;tent&quot; page, listed just a few days 
ago.

Contact them at (714)871-1322, or http://www.classicvws_dot_com.

I looked. They have several dealerships in CA and one in AZ, where they 
buy up old VWs and restore them... and offer the same services for 
others.
