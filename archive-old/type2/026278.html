&gt; After purchasing it and spending 600 on the braking system, the
&gt; engine has
&gt; now seized on me !
&gt; 
&gt; Engine that has seized - Volkspares Gold engine, supposedly with
&gt; Unleaded
&gt; heads.

Yikes!  I hope you got a warranty with that.

&gt; The garage has basically said that it is cheaper to get a Rec-con
&gt; engine as
&gt; opposed to trying to repair the old engine.

Yes, but &quot;cheaper&quot; = &quot;not as good&quot;.  Cheap engines don't last as long.

&gt; If I'm going to spend most of my time on the Motorway, what would be
&gt; the
&gt; best replacement engine ?

Your best bet would be to rebuild it yourself (unless you have piles
of cash).  Not really difficult, just time consuming.  Then you will
*know* it's been built properly and is not going to seize on you.
There are lots of books around on the subject.
For optimum reliability, go with a stock engine.

&gt; I thought to go for the biggest i.e 2.0l but the garage has said that
&gt; anything with twin carbs is going to require a lot of tuning.

Much more expensive too and harder to get parts.  The stock carbs
aren't a problem once they're set up properly, provided they're not
worn out.

&gt; Is cruising at 75-80 mph an unrealistic goal for my Van ? If so what
&gt; speed
&gt; does every one else go at ? Is this foot to the floor ? :-&gt;

This is more like the *maximum* speed.  You will not do your van any
favours by going at this speed all the time.  Running at a good 10 mph
less will put a lot less strain on your engine and you will use a lot
less fuel (and stay below the speed limit).  If you really want to go
fast, get a newer vehicle.  Sorry if this sounds &quot;preachy&quot;, just use a
bit of common sense.  These type 2's are getting old and need to be
preserved.
