Subject: Stud Puller - old message

Last month, about mid - late May there was posted a link to metric stud 
pullers.  Sometime before may 19, 2004


The message is not yet in the archives, and it has dropped off the current 
reading list.

For me, can someone identify the site that had these metric stud pullers.

Thanks
