Subject: Re: [T2] Exploded air flow meter and my new parts bus

&gt; &gt; How in the hell can this happen to an AFM? It had been sitting for
&gt; &gt; 5 years, being started once in a while. Could a backfire cause that
&gt; &gt; kind of force?

Sure. I have seen it done too. No hose clamps on that one though, but 
it had been sprayed with a too liberal application of starter fluid. 
I got there too late to save it. Never believe that if a 2 second 
spray of starter fluid won't start the car that a 20 second dose of 
it will. It was like Hiroshima in the engine compartment. Luckily 
nothing else got burned.

Good idea on using welders panel clamps to get it to seal. I never 
thought it that.
