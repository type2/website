Subject: [WTB][Friday] Seeking Holiday Accessories

I need for my bus, in order of preference:

	--One pair caribou antlers, or
	--One pair elk antlers, or
	--One pair deer antlers but they better be impressive

These are to complement the big wreath and the lights.

Will consider overseas in the case of authentic caribou/reindeer antlers.
Can pay. Please help me brighten the holiday season for tens of thousands
of Memphians who are looking pretty grouchy and sallow lately.

Also seeking large quantity of red &amp; green LEDs.

I am not obsessed [which is precisely what all obsessed people say],
