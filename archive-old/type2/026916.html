Subject: Substitute Rear Seat Mounting Hardware?

Fellow lister Michael Benthin generously gifted me a spare 2 person middle 
passenger seat for my 75 bus which I plan to mount in the original position. 
  I haven't been able to find a source for the original mounting hardware 
but figure that someone out there has found the right 
plumbing/electrical/HVAC piece that does the job.  It's
the set of little hooked dogs which clamp the seat tubes down and receive a 
bolt from the underbelly.   Any suggestions?
