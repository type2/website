Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust leak

Alex,

One other thing you might want to try first (if you haven't already 
done it this way) is to start with all of the connection nuts just 
finger tight -- at the flanges at at the exhaust ports in the heads. 
Then tighten them all up progressive, a quarter turn at a time, using a 
diagonal pattern (driver's side ports, then passenger's side flange, 
then passenger's side ports, then drivers side flange) until everything 
is tight. New gaskets at the ports, of course.

Could be, however, that you're not getting enough torque with that 
shorty wrench!

Mark
