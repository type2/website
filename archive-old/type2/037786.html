Subject: Shuddering bus, wheels, wind

Hello!
     I am the 
so-proud-I-get-up-in-the-middle-ofthe-night-to-go-look-at-it new owner of 
a '78 transporter.  When I test drove it, I could scarcely believe how 
smooth and tight it felt.  I had previosly owned a '79 and remembered 
that finding gears was an iffy game involving much stirring, perfect 
timing, a little luck and not infrequent unhappy noises.  I have been 
enjoying shifting so smoothly so I noticed right away, then, when about a 
week ago it started shuddering going into gear, especially first.  The 
clutch actually did need some adjusting, had a little too much play, so I 
did that and that improved the situation, but did not cure it.  Being an 
idiot, I asked Muir and he said that either my flywheel is bent or there 
is a broken spring on the clutch pressure plate.  Does it seem unlikely 
that a flywheel would bend under normal driving conditions?  This thing 
was smooth as glass a week ago.  More to the point, since both 
possibilities involve pulling a beautifully running engine I wasn't 
planning on rebuilding for quite some time, is this something I need to 
deal with immediately or can I keep being very ginger with the clutch?  
Am I overlooking another possibility as the cause?
     An unrelated question: I've beem poking around and have seen very 
few resources for alloy wheels for my bus.  I don't often see buses with 
anything but stock wheels.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Suppliers? 
 Websites with photos of buses with aftermarket wheels I could get ideas 
from?  Pros and cons of those wheel adapters? 
     Finally, in response to the Santa Ana wind stories, my mother-in-law 
says that when she drove a VW 20 or 30 years ago in New York, some 
highways had special signs they would drag out on windy days specifically 
forbidding VW buses from getting on them!
