Subject: Subscription Info for Type 2 List?

Hi Volks!
Have been the proud owner of VWs for quite some time now.  Just noticed
someone had CC'ed some email to a Type 2, list (this was the address).
Could some kind soul forward subscription info to me?  I'm already on Air
Cooled VW.

peace,
     Jack

'74 Bus

PS - Will a '76 Bus tranny (has a 2.0 litre engine) fit in my '74????

PPS - Looking for the following for my baby (1974 Bus):

Emergency brake cables
Heater Cables
Front Spare Tire Mount (prefer the Aftermarket type that hold the tire AWAY
from the body)
Camper gear:  sink, fridge, stove, closets, shelves, etc . . .
Chrome Bumpers
Front seats
Door liners
Lug Nuts (yeah, they're not as easy to find as you might think)
