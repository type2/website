&gt;There is no radio in the dash now.....just a black hole......I was
&gt;wondering if any of the newer radio styles fit the bus. Where is the other
&gt;place to put speakers on a bus, since most radios come with a 4 speaker
&gt;connection. So, if I put 2 in the doors, where do I put the other 2?? In
&gt;the back area, a la Vanagon??

I do not know for sure, but I have been told it works on a Bug, the Pioneer
DEH 1100 will fit the dash without cutting. It slips in from behind and you
discard the outer chassis. I have one I am mounting in my Bug, and as I
remember the hole is the same on all VWs from the 60's to the 70's. These
are not a pull-out type, they just mount permenent. As for the speakers, you
can mount them in the doors, under the dash, in an overhead console, or
where ever. The rears can be mounted in the same ways, I have seen some
mounted in side panels in the rear of a non-camper, and in overhead storage
in campers.
