Congrats Wade,

Its a strange &quot;copyright&quot; world out there!  Founder Walter Taylor left the 
Taylor winery in NY and started a new label named &quot;Bully Hill&quot;.  He was 
prevented by his old company from having his own last name appear anywhere on 
the labels of his new company, even as as part of his signature!
