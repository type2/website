&gt; I agree with your courtesy lesson except for the turning off of lights

&gt;From what I've observed, some truckers can turn off their tail lights 
independently from their headlights, so it's easy for them.  Haven't 
seen anyone use flashers as a thank-you.  A brief amount of darkness, 
for me is acceptable in return for a favor.
