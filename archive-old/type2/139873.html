Subject: Re: [T2] Starter/Bus Depot

Volks

  I know this is a rerun but can't help but say how great those guys at
Bus Depot are,  Monday (a holiday) my starter failed,  I called em about
6PM and ordered a Bosch Rebuilt starter for an auto tranny bus. not
exactly a Stock item usually.  asked for expidited delivery.  WED!! it was
sitting on my doorsill.  (they promised Fri)  WOW!

got it in this morning (in 22degree weather) and it seems to work
perfectly bus started right up when I got it in, about an hour work in the
snow...

one little irony, the core charge and what it will cost me to return the
core is about the same,.....but that is the shippers fault not Bus Depot

Thanks guys
Bob
