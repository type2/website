Subject: Head Bolt Tightening '78 2.0L

Hi All,        
        I have a noise from the left head that soungs like an exhaust
leak. I just replaced the muffler and pipes so I think I have a loose
head or a bad valve seat? I searched the archives for a procedure to
check the torque on the heads while the motor is in the vehicle, but
couldn't find one.Can this be done without pulling the motor. Is there a
procedure for this? Thanks in advance for all answers and advice.
        Merry Christmas to all.     

        Thanks
        Ralph 78 westy
