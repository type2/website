Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for brake caliper

Hal, what about rotor clearance etc?  I've been researching some of the
European's solutions to this problem.  They seem to have more options
available, at least according to a book I bought last spring.  Sorry -- I'm
moving, the book is packed away, I don't recall the name although I wrote of
it here at the time.  A 4 piston or even plain old ventilated rotor would be
a huge step up.  Last time I took the Bus down to Pine Creek in north
central Pennsy, the front brakes were smoking on the incline.

&gt;now god knows what can be found in the aftermarket world.

I went looking a few months ago, just for gits&amp;shiggles, and
what's available in the aftermarket world for the disc brake
Bays is (apparently) nothing.

OTOH, I was &quot;messing around&quot; at the junkyard and found that
early-to-mid '80s BMW 7 series has a 4-piston caliper that
could bolt to the late Bus spindle if the mounting holes were
opened up.
