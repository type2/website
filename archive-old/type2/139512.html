&gt; &gt; And Todd, Bay's first appeared in 1968 so unless
&gt; &gt; someone had just picked up a brand-spanking-new 1969 Bus all of the

&gt; 
&gt; No no!, the first modelyear is 1968, so they started
&gt; production in august 1967! It is the year with all
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &lt;Woodstock was August 15, 16, 17 -- the 1969 model
&gt; &gt; year started August 1st&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; So I guess they must have been all 1968 models. I
&gt; don't see how a 1969 model could be there in time,
&gt; there must be at least a month in between runing from
&gt; the assembly line to being delivered to the customer.

Oops, you are (almost) correct. You got in a hurry and finished up by
saying the exact same (wrong) thing that I did after correcting my
model-year mistake.

The Buses at Woodstock would have been '68 *AND* '69 models built from
August 1st 1967 to July 31st 1968 ('68 models) and August 1st 1968 to July
31st 1969 ('69 models).

For a '70 model to have been in the states it would have to have been
pre-ordered and shipped from the factory on the first day of production
August 1st 1970. Transit by ship would have taken nearly 2 weeks to get it
delivered to the port in New York. 

New models shipped from overseas normally don't hit the US until
mid-September, about 6 weeks after start of production.
