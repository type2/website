Hi all:

I recently bought a 79 bus.

I have been having difficulty removing one of the rear axle nuts. I have
tried heat, to no avail, and so far I have bent two separate 3/4 inch
breaker bars.

I have been thinking of chiseling the nut off. Before I do that I
thought I'd see whether someone knows a trick.

Thanks

Rob Mead
