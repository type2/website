&gt; &gt;Sorry to be dense, but could someone explain this to me?  I thought
&gt; &gt;backfiring was caused when a cylinder detonates at some time it's not
&gt; &gt;supposed to, like well before TDC, or on the exhaust stroke.  Usually
&gt; &gt;related more to incorrect timing, connection of the distributor wires,
&gt; &gt;etc.  How does the exhaust system affect backfiring at all?
&gt; 
&gt; It can also be caused by an air leak near the exhaust port... cold air
&gt; getting sucked back into the cylinder.  Very bad...
&gt; 

Or from what I understand, fresh air from the leak (which could be 
almost anywhere in the exhaust system) mixes with unburned fuel and 
hot gasses and KABOOM!!  There is a richer mixture going through the 
engine when you decelerate which leads to more unburned fuel exiting 
the cylinders.
