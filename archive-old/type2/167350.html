Subject: Re: SQUEAL after Rebuilt Trans installed. What??

&gt; There is a short loud squeal at times.  It is loud, one or 2 seconds, and 
&gt; not grinding. It is entirely predictable and, wouldn't you know it, never 
&gt; happens when I return to the shop;  I left it overnight so he could start 
&gt; from cold. His assessment is that it is a whistle and he takes no 
&gt; responsibility. IMO,  no way is it a whistle -- I don't think he heard 
&gt; what I hear. 
&gt;

LOL.. I guess he didn't install the whistle eh? 

Was a NEW pilot bearing installed?
If not,, that is my guess... and if you keep driving it till the pilot 
bearing seizes on the input shaft,,, you won't be able to change gears 
properly,, and you will have a bugger of a time getting the engine off the 
trans to put a new one in. 

The pilot bearing is in the center of the flywheel on the engine. 

hope that helps
