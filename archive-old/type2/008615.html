I am trying to troubleshoot a strong small of gas which comes when I fill
my tank over 2/3 full.    As far as I can tell, there is no direct leak
from the tank or filler hose.

Do I have to pull the engine to check this fully?

I own a 72 Type II.

Any help would be appreciated.  Private messages ok as well.
