Subject: Re: [T2] Set screws in heads


&gt;&gt; M10 x 1.00 pitch. It's nearly impossible to find anything in that
&gt;&gt; size.
&gt;
&gt; If you dont plan on reinstalling the smog equipment, you could
&gt; probably get away with retapping with whatever you find handy.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps tap them with an apropriate NPT tap and install a pipe plug
&gt; into the holes?

Cool. Ironically, I ran in Ace Hardware for some bolts for another
application (it's closer than the bolt specialty place I was at before)
and they had a M10 1.00 tap. I'll give it a try or I may tap it out to
M10 1.25 or 1.50 so I can use a longer bolt. My problem is that the set
screws are short (about 1&quot; long) and slotted. It's almost impossible to
get a feel for the threading with a common screwdriver inserted 4&quot; into
the block. A 120mm M10 x 1.25 would work nicely. The 1.00 pitch bolts
are harder to find in those lengths.

Fortunately, I know it's not a big issue but I do want my bus running
quiet again. I got the exhaust all straightened out just to find this
issue had returned...
