&gt; A friend of mine just bought a pretty nice bus.
&gt; When I found out about it, after the fact, is when I found out the engine

my deepest condolences
&gt; 
&gt; Well, anyway, my first inspection of the bus was when I told him to:
&gt; Change the oil (30W) every 300 miles of the first 1500 miles,
&gt; Then go to a 1,000 mile change twice before
&gt; Settling into a regular 2,000 change cycle.

and start saving for a new engine

might suggest he try synthetic after break in

&gt; The engine has very few (approx. 1,000) miles on it.
