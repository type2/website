Subject: Fw: dual hose dist.

 [...]


 &gt; O.K. this has got me real confused. I have a 74 and run the dual vacuum
 &gt; dist. and the book said to time it at 10ATDC. It said to do this with
both
 &gt; hoses on. Whats all this about 7.5 BTDC and 5 ATDC. Mine even has a
little
 &gt; red dot to line up with at the 10.


 Since you have a 74, it is a 1700 with manual trans or a 1800 Fed version
 with manual trans, then you must be using the 021 905 205N distributor.
This
 dist. has 16-18 degrees of vacuum retard in it. That is why you time it at
 idle with both vacuum lines on at 10 after. The retard side should have
 vacuum at idle.
 If you had a 73 with a 021 905 205F, it would have 11-14 degrees retard and
 time at 5 after.
 If you had a 74 with auto trans you would have a 021 905 205S, it would
have
 11-13 degrees retard and time at 5 after.
 If you notice, there is 5 degrees difference in total vaciim retard between
 your dist. with 10 degree after initial timing and the other 2 distributors
with 5  degree after initial timing.
 That is where the difference is in initial timing.
I would verify that your distributor has the correct vacuum unit on it
before setting the timing at 10 after. I would set it at 7.5 before with the
retard vacuum hose disconnected and plugged and the engine at idle. Then
reconnect retard vacuum. Now see where your timing is. If it is at 5 after,
you have the wrong vacuum unit. Setting your timing at 10 after would cause
it to be sluggish and hesitate. In this case I would either always set it at
5 after or look for the correct vac. unit. Finding the correct one and it
being good may not happen :)
 All 3 distributors have identical centrifugal advance specs. 9-14 _at_ 2000
and
 21-25 _at_ 3400.
 If you time any of these distributors correctly at idle w/vacuum on the
 retard side and then disconnect vacuum, the timing would advance to 7.5
 before on each one. The same timing as a late 76-78 and Fed 79 using the
021
 905 205P/022 905 205S distributors.
 I hope this doesn't confuse anyone.
