&gt;Ah.  11mm would be the nut that secures the rear brake drum on 72-79 
buses
&gt;(maybe 71's also?).  AFAIK that's the only 11mm on a bus.  

Well and obviously all the hard brake line fittings as well.  But I 
agree with Mike that seems the only bolt that size.  Rocker nuts as 
well on the T4, 11mm being the size for an M7 bolt or nut.

&gt;There was some speculation on 14mm too.  I can't remember, but either 
my bus
&gt;or my 914 has 14mm lock nuts on the valves.  Since they're both 74 914 
2.0
&gt;motors you'd think they'd be the same...

Yep, the 10mm screw lock down nuts are 14mm, as are oddly enough back 
to brakes the other side of all the brake unions, the rubber hose ends 
are 14mm.

In an continued attempt to be pains I'll say that the EV has a whole 
bunch of bizzare typically unused metric nut sizes, like 18 (not so 
uncommon), 16 (I don't own one something english fit), and a whole host 
of other ones that sometimes I swear are actually english.  Who knows.
