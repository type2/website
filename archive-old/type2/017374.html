Subject: Re: best bus

I have owned (or own) a '65 21-window, '71 non-pop Camper, '74 Westy,
'76 Westy, '77 Sunroof, '78 Auto Westy &amp; '79 Auto Westy.

I will have to say that the '71 was the best. Great styling (taillights,
bumpers, turn signals, gauge cluster), dual-port 1600 (easy to work on &amp;
remove) and was just damn fun to drive...

My vote is to the 1971 VW Bus or Camper.
