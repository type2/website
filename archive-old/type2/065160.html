&gt;Subject: FI help needed

&gt;I put a rebuilt engine in my '80 Vanagon and still haven't been able to get
&gt;it started.  When I turn the key it starts for a second and then dies, every
&gt;time.  I've checked and double checked all connections and fittings and all
&gt;looks OK.  I suspect the fuel injection.  

&gt;In my experimenting today I found that if I try to start the engine with the
&gt;Control Unit disconnected, the engine starts and then dies just like when
&gt;it's connected.  Could my Control Unit be shot?  Anyone know of a way to
&gt;check out the Control Unit?  Please don't say &quot;replace it and see if it
&gt;works&quot;.  I'm not sure where to look next!
 Your van is running on the cold start valve, which is on when cranking, and
basically separate from your FI. Also your fuel pump is also running 
when cranking. Probably also when key in 'on' position, or the van would run
a little while in teh 'on' position. (See step 4.)

1.Disconnect one injector, and hook a 12v test lamp across the connector (wiring
harness side). Crank engine. Does the lamp flicker? If so, your
FI system is basically working.

2.If not, the connect the ballast resistor side of this connector through lamp 
to ground. YOu may need an buzzer/ohomete to figure out which goes to the 
ballast 
resistors which in a 76 are above the double relay on teh left side firewall.
Does it light when cranking? 
Yes: Double relay/ Ballast resistors/ injector power  OK.
No: The 12v power source to the injectors is bad. This goes through the double
relay, and ballast resistors. Check connection from coil to FI system (on a 
76 this is the same wire as the backup light fuse.
You can pry the cover off the double relay, and hold one of these relays
closed while trying to start van. It will be the one not closing on cranking.
The other controls the fuel pump. I think it is the right hand one?
Don't let the double relay scare you. It is just two relays, two diode, and
a resistor. I was told it contained complicated unrepairable electronics:-0
Not so!

3.If you get light in above test, try hooking the other wire on the connector
through the test lamp to +12v. This is testing to see if Control Unit is
trying to fire the injectors by grounding this wire periodically.
If you don't get flashes, then you have connection, ECU problems, or 
something else like the head temp sensor, or god knows what.

4. There is a switch in the air flow sensor that controls fuel pump operation.
If you disconnect the wires, and measure resistance on the air flow sensor.
One pair of contacts should go to zero when engine is being cranked. Check you 
wiring diagram for which pins. are teh switch.

Good Luck
Been there last Saturday;-)
