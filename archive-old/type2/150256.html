He said he would put new exhaust valves in, check the other valves and guides.
He said he would clean them up and would check that all the springs were
within spec. The guy said he has been in business for 40 years and he loves
working on VW heads. A general reconditioning is what he defined his work with
the heads as.

Max,

Rods sound right, but $60 for heads sound really really cheap.

What are they doing to them for $60?

Not to screw up a good deal on the heads if it is good, but what *are*
they doing to them?

Cheers, dave

&gt; BUS CONTENT: My case is headed out to the machine shop to be align-bored
and
&gt; to have the end thrust cut. The crank will be polished, is that necessary?
The
&gt; shop recommends I buy a set of refurbished rods for $50 rather than do the
&gt; work on my rods such as sizing, aligning, and putting one bushing in. Seems
a
&gt; little crazy to me. My heads are being done at another place for a total of
&gt; $60. Does anything seem out of the ordinary or is a ok?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks all,
