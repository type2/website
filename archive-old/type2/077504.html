Subject: Re: [T2] heat and noise in a vw bus

Jeff,
Glad to hear your insulation project went well(no pun intended).  One
question; wwhat kind if insulation did you use underneath the back seat/bed?
 I have a deluxe wagon, so there's no bed.  My intent is to block SOME
of the engine noise. Does the 3M undercoating go on OK?

Thanks,

Simon Ramirez Jr.

&gt; I just finished before Labor Day a total resto on my '77, including
&gt; a
&gt; complete repaint in another color. Since I wanted to change colors
&gt; completely, I thoroughly gutted it ( I should mention it is a Westy).
&gt; After
&gt; a thorough cleaning of the shell and then the repaint, I sprayed the
&gt; interior side walls with 3M rubberized undercoating, then applied a
&gt; self
&gt; adhesive foil faced insulation between the ribs on the side walls.
&gt; Then the
&gt; original insulation went back in, then the interior. The result is
&gt; a bus
&gt; that is almost too quiet! I can't hear the engine as well as I am used
&gt; to. I
&gt; can carry on a conversation with a back seat passenger without yelling.
&gt; My
&gt; heating system is intact and in fairly good shape, the only addition
&gt; being a
&gt; blower added up front, and it works very well. My door seals are new,
&gt; and
&gt; the front grill vents seal when closed. All this adds up to a bus that
&gt; is
&gt; warmer and quieter than I ever dreamed possible.
