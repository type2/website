Subject: Installing new door seals

Hi all, I was looking thru the archives and couldn't find any good info here.
I recieved my new front door seal from the Bus Depot yesterday. What would
anybody recommend for removing the old sealant/rubber. Yeah a rasor can be
used for the parts of the seal that ran flush with the door, but what about
the impossible to get stuff in the U channel?

Also, should 3M weatherstip adhesive do the trick? I also got two new felt
channels for the roll up windows on both sides. I suspect I'll have the
same problem in removing the goo.

Suggestions? Just go for it? It always seem I default to the latter :-)

TIA
