Subject: Re: [T2] Heating

Thanks for all the comments......

I think it is best to go for the Eberspacher heater? It seems to me
that it will work simply and doesn't have all the hastle of the
exchangers, fans, ducting etc.

I would love to get the stock heating working, it would be a challenge
to get it all insulated etc but I think that I would have to check any
gaps/leaks after every engine drop.

Can anyone advise on any general maintenance required for the heater?

I have seen an ad on the Samba_dot_com, has anyone had any dealings with
this person/company?

&gt; The gas heater is great but the OEM system is good down to freezing temps IF
everything is present. I have a friend with a Riviera that makes great heat
down to freezing or did before the outer layer of the &quot;U&quot; tubes rotted off.
Lowered heater box output temps significantly and thus the interior temps.
&gt;
&gt; When it works right the OEM system isn't bad but most folks don't take the
time to fix it and like me don't realize that some of the details like the
outer skin to the U-tubes exists until much later.
