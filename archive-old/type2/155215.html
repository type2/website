Subject: Re: [T2] New VW Design Chief

&lt;&lt;I was just wondering how well our busses sold compared to other brands
in the day?&gt;&gt;

Comapred to Mopar, GM, and Ford?

Big Time Overpriced


&lt;&lt; And why VW doesn't think it's profitable to make campmobile-type
vehicles anymore. Have costs gotten so high that they've priced
themselves out of the market?&gt;&gt;

It's a real small maket base, and when you are trying to sell a specific
vehicle to a niche' market--you best be competitive.

I sure wouldn't be spending $75,000.00 for underpowered, undependable
Eurovan Westy.

Winnebago already has built them , and VW failed with them.

&lt;&lt; I don't think so.&gt;&gt;

I do.

&lt;&lt; Just look at RV prices these days.&gt;&gt;

Yea--look at the &quot;People's Car&quot; today.
They sure aren't priced for the people.

&lt;&lt; When I was in that nice campground in Gulf Shores, I had to laugh
that most of those vehicles cost over 100 times what I paid for mine.&gt;&gt;

Yea they did.
But they boght bew--you bought an used up sardine can.
They can actually walk around, have a full sized real refrigertor, a
dining room table to sit at while their watching the football game on
their big screen TV, can sit down on the pot as they read the  Sunday
paper , and tale an actually shower with hot water.

Ya only get what ya pay for,

&lt;&lt; And I slept just as good as they did.&gt;&gt;

And that's it---you slept in your Van.

I can sleep real good in the back of a station wagon.

&lt;&lt; Some of them were no doubt over $200K.&gt;&gt;

$200 plus, no doubt.

But look what they have--and look what you got.
Some folks have priorities--some don't.

&lt;&lt; I dare say there are more of our vehicles still running around than
similar vintage vans of any other brand.&gt;&gt;

Take a real good look.
There are an a bunch of mid 80's, early 90's Fords, Chevy's, and Dodges
still running around.

You aren't looking at what else is on the road cause you don't have one.

&lt;&lt; But did they really compete when they were new?&gt;&gt;

They had a really small portion of the Van market--not even enough to
count.

VW  failed because they didn't advertise or promote them.
Then when the word got out that they wern't reliable-that was the nail
in the coffin .
