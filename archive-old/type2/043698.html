&gt;Magnesium Porsche cases are very rare. The early 25 Hp
&gt;based Porsche cases were of course, some very early 911
&gt;or experimental cases were, and maybe some that were used
&gt;in race cars.

in fact, the opposite is true. the early sand-cast aluminum cases
and permanent mold aluminum cases of the 911 were phased out in
1968, the case itself was high-pressure cast magnesium, being a more
precise piece requiring less machining, and the case weighed in 22 lbs.
lighter than the sand-cast case. in 1969, porsche won an award for the
largest magnesium pressure die-casting ever made. other magnesium
pieces included chain housings and covers, valve covers, etc.,( which went
back to aluminum in 1977, these were pressure-cast aluminum-silicon alloy.)
the heads and cam towers continued to be made from aluminum.

in terms of vw case studs, this has little impact. perhaps it is the softening
of the case from overheating, more likely the problem comes from
the threads in the case being pulled a little each time the engine expands,
like the pulled stud case problem of the 911, the cures for which are of no
small concern, i am sure... the deep-stud solution and the fifth-stud solution
certainly help. i found G*X ( the ignominius dream merchants ) have a deep-
stud time-sert with a bottom in it to prevent leaks, but they won't sell it without
the engine. the dilavar stud worked wonders for the 911 engine, perhaps the
market for the vw wasn't strong enough to warrant the solution , since the
magnesium cases were phased out with the advent of the aluminum T4 case.
