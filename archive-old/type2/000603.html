That was quick considering it's Saterday-evening in Germany.

Don't get your hopes up yet. A month ago I e-mailed a simple question on my
new  Eurovan to Pons Automobiel Handel (PAH ismuch like VWoA the reps for VW
in Holland). I also got a quick reply asking for my snail mail address. Four
weeks later I got a short note in the letterbox that was 'useless and slow'
and I was no the wiser so I can start all over again. Next time I'll try
just phoning them.

In the whole discussion I cannot exclude that it's just the American legal
system (and the laywers that are on commission) that's driving all this. In
Europe this nonsense is virtually absent. I'm afraid however that in a few
years the situation over here will be much like yours today. As soon as our
lawyers smell money .....
