Subject: Re: [T2] altitude -advancing vs low octane gas found at 
  altitude

&gt; Obviously one can lower the octane at altitude or they wouldn't sell it that
way. B So you
&gt; buy regular gas at altitude B and have your timing advanced-this wouldn't
&gt; put you back to square one and risk detonation?

Whatever you do to compensate for a too-rich mixture at high elevation, it is
absolutely necessary to change it back before driving at lower altitudes or
switching to extra-low-octane gas.  As you've suggested, failing to undo the
changes would be a bad idea.  Running too lean or too advanced can cause
overheating, detonation, burned valves, thrown rods, non-rebuildable cores,
death, taxes, war, terrorism, Enron, and divorce.  If you run *really* lean
and use *way* too much advance, all of these things to will happen to you at
once, and you'll have a whole lot of explaining to do when you go in for your
interview with Saint Peter.

Just remember to be careful!
