Subject: Re: [T2] Timing and Dwell

Why would you disconnect the retard hose?  That would just keep the
engine from slowing down faster and if anything, keep idle high when you
come to a stop until you &quot;force&quot; it down using the clutch...

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Two things:
&gt; 
&gt; Dwell is inversly proportional to width of point gap.  Since dwell is the
&gt; degrees of distributor rotation while the points are closed, increasing the
&gt; point gap decreases the dwell.  If your dwell is at 44, decrease the point gap
&gt; to attain a dwell of 50.  Changing the gap also changes the timing and any point
&gt; gap change requires a timing adjustment.  Over time, the gap closes up due to
&gt; the rubbing block wearing.  If greased properly, the rubbing block should wear
&gt; very little.
&gt; 
&gt; Timing:  If you run a mechanical advance only distributor, total advance should
&gt; not exceed 31 - 32 degrees at 3500 rpm.  The 009 has a total of 10 degrees of
&gt; distributor advance which eguals 20 degrees at the crank.  The 050 has 14
&gt; degrees at the distributor and 28 at the crank.  Using the 050, you can time to
&gt; 3 or 4 degrees initial advance.  Easier starting and low speed operation.  In
&gt; the heavy bus, a lower initial setting gives better bottom end while the vacuum
&gt; advance gives a cleaner burn and increases milage while cruising.  If you have
&gt; the double vacuum distributor, pull and plug the retard hose (On the side of the
&gt; vacuum pot towards the dist. cap.)  Set the timing to 7.5 degrees.  The
&gt; mechanical distributors react only to engine RPM; the combination distributors
&gt; react to both speed and load.
&gt; 
&gt; Keep smiling,
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
