&lt;&lt;Isnt that JC Whitney now????&gt;&gt;

Bingo.

JC Whitney was always around.
It was the mail order end of  Warshawsky's.

There was a small sign on the north side of the building that said &quot;
Also JC Whitney&quot;--2 ft. x 4 ft, and 40 ft up in the air, written in red
paint on a white board.

What a nut house, and you had to take a BAR down there with you to by
parts on South State Street.( nonot a rolling tavern A Browning
Automatic Rifle)

Speaking od rifling--yuor vehicles contents automaticly got rifled while
you were shopping--and you had to pay to park in their lot across the
street.
If you arked on the street--the whole vehicle would be gone.

Very Interesting place.

They did have some neat stuff for VW's available.
