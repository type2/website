Alternatively you can try to install the left caliper on the right and
vice versa. I *think* they are symmetric for 71-72 but not positive.
Others please correct me.

Hi Barry &amp; Arnaud,

It sounds like the calipers were mounted in the reverse order(left caliper on the right side and vice versa). The locating bolt should be on the bottom and it is probably on the top. If you paid to have them installed, I would take it back and show the mechanic the Bentley. I would think that he should correct that for no charge. The caliper pistons will also have to be rotated 180 degrees (can be a pita) and the metal shims reversed. See Bentley. If you don't trust that the mechanic knows what he is doing, you would probably be better off with the Bentley and doing it yourself. 
(It would also be a great time to replace the rubber brake lines).
