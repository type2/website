Anybody else seen the new 1-800 call AT&amp;T commercial with the guitar freak who's
smashing all the windows from the sound wave vibrations? If you look close for a
split second ( no pun intended) right at the beginning you can see a velvet
green standard microbus in front of the garage the kid is practicing guitar in.
If you blink you'll miss it!
