Subject: 2nd battery usefullness? misc.

Alright Alright its WINTER!! I get the freaking point!!! SO Im freezing in
Chicago and Blue isnt as happy as he used to be. Only a few weeks to the
rebuild, he's just got to hang in there. So my mornings go like this......
cold seat, spare &quot;warm up&quot; key, foot on gas, give one good faith pump, turn
key, give several more good faith pumps.  Blue says &quot;wa WA wa WA wa WA&quot; foot
pump, foot pump &quot;Wa wa Wa wa WA WA WA WA wa WA wa WA WA WA WA
WAVROOOOMMM......&quot; and then he idles happily (somewhat) till Im ready to go.
Heres my question...
Would a new battery help this?(main batt not too old, 5 months actually)
Is the Aux battery of any use during this process? I remember once I left
Blues lights on for at least 24 hours and killed battery. When I turned the
key he went  &quot;click..&quot; like any &quot;normal&quot; vehicle would and then started
right up. I assumed he found no charge at the main and moved on to auxillary
if thats possible. So my question would be does or would this 2nd batt. aid
in hard start situations that I would consider replacing that one (wich is
who knows how old....) Also take into account my oil soaked 3rd cyl Sprk
plg. etc etc. Faithful starter till the cold. I know this is expected though
especially in a vehicle with a shady history as Blue has. I dont know how
many &quot;creative&quot; minds have had thier hands in him b4.
    My headlights continue to fail till warm up (along with wipers) although
now that the temp has dropped further they havnt come on at all. I DID jump
out the fuse although having trble with both of these items and to no avail.
The one thing they do have in common oddly enough is they both run to the
hazard relay in some way?(checking my HAYNES) I will check this out tommrw.
(although again, signals work fine..) Yet the relay is held together with a
rubberband (previously broke in two... :) I think I just found the prob. UG.
any thoughts on any of the above  I would appreciate it!!!!!!
Take care all!
STAY WARM!!!!
Steve
