&gt; Second notice that I will be visiting out west for the next two weeks.  I
&gt; will be flying to Las Vegas tomorrow, then to Los Angeles on Monday.  I
&gt; will be flying back to Las Vegas on the following Monday and home to DC on
&gt; 1/4.  I would dearly love it of someone arranged some kind of meet for
&gt; 12/28, perhaps in the Topanga Park?  Also if anyone wants to do something
&gt; in Las Vegas either this coming weekend or the weekend of 1/3-4 I woudl
&gt; love to meet any Vegas listies!

was in Las Vegas some months ago, and whilee I didn't take my bus there
were a few to be seen.  unfortunately I had a rental dodge, (with A/C) and
one day when there was nothing happening at the conference I was
attending, I drove to Death Valley - highly reccomended._dot_desolate beauty
is the only description,  on the way back I was on a two lane road and was
being passed,, glanced down and I was doing over 90mph!!! I slowed down,
(mandatory bus content) when you drive a bus long enough you only seem to
know how to drive with your peddle to the floor.....

enjoy the trip
