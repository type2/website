Subject: Single Cab Bench Seat - saved!

Ok, I've been informally chastised by type2 list subscribers for my 
intention to discard my old and tattered '60 single cab bench seat.  I 
had posted a similar note to the aircooled list a week ago and didn't 
get any replies and therefore thought that nobody would care if I threw 
the seat away.  
However, I've been taught a lesson and will keep the seat in the back 
of the truck (it has a covered wagon style canopy) until someone in the 
Los Angeles area claims it. I promise not to throw any VW parts away 
except old rocker cover gaskets.

Lessie '60 model 261 in Alhambra, CA; home of Alhambra Foundry, known 
the world over for Alhambra Foundry manhole covers .-)
