&gt;&gt; We are trying to find out just how much &quot;bang for the buck&quot; there is
&gt;&gt; when
&gt;&gt; vehicles are removed from the road, e.g., just how much air pollution
&gt;&gt; will be
&gt;&gt; stopped when this vehicle no longer functions?  This information is of
&gt;&gt; critical
&gt;&gt; importance because many people want to assign a dollar value to the
&gt;&gt; amount of
&gt;&gt; emissions that are reduced.  Clearly, if certain parts of the vehicle
&gt;&gt; are put
&gt;&gt; back into use (even if they don't pollute the air), it will directly
&gt;&gt; effect the
&gt;&gt; monetary value within this overall process.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For example, what is a &quot;fair market value&quot; for a scrapped car?  $500?
&gt;&gt; $750?
&gt;&gt; $200?  Unless that vehicle is 100% removed from the vehicle
&gt;population,
&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt; automatically have a &quot;sliding scale&quot; and the potential for some major
&gt;&gt; administrative headaches!
&gt;
&gt;Give me a break!  It's obvious that the real reason for not allowing
&gt;parting-out is to make sure that other vehicles are junked sooner for
&gt;lack of parts.

I didn't really understand that either. I can imagine a hypothetical case
where a person might sell the engine (let's say it's a very smoky engine)
out of a car, then volunteer to have the car scrapped. Somebody takes the
engine and brings a dormant junker back to life with it. In this case, you
have scrapped one car but in reality you have removed zero gross polluters
&gt;from the road.

But Mr. Pederson specifically is talking about parts &quot;even if they don't
pollute the air&quot;. I cannot see how a fender or a seat or something could
possibly skew his &quot;bang for the buck&quot; calculation, whatever the veracity of
that calculation might otherwise be, and it is probably very dubious.

And the possibility that there would be very many smoky engines passed
around seems remote. Seems to me that for purposes of a program like this,
&quot;vehicle&quot; could simply mean &quot;plate(s) with the VIN number on them&quot;, and it
really doesn't matter much what happens to the rest of the car. Unless of
course Mr. Lyle is correct and he usually is. =^ )
