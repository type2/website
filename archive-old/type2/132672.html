Subject: electrical detailing

Hi there!

I reinstalled the engine in my west (1700cc, 1974, Manual trans). I 
have figured out to plug the wires to have sparks, but there are many 
wires that are not plugged in and I can't figure out where to plug 
those!

Does anyone has pictures detailing engine bay wiring?

Thanks!

Marck
