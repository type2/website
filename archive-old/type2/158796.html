Subject: Re: [T2] bilge blower heater retrofit - was: Oil cooler as heat
   source inside van.

Hello all!

I just did this with my '78 westy. I had this set-up
on my '79 bus for over 3 years with no problems, then
I put a BA-6 gas heater in my '79. I have a BA-6 for
my '78 westy, but never anytime to put it in.

What I did was put the 3&quot; bilge blower under the front
pan, right under the front floor, so it is sucking the
air from the back to the front. But it is far enough
forward that it doesn't get to hot, but you do get
more air flow. My attwood blower says it is rated at
145 CFM. I bought my blowers off that auction site,
you know the one. I bought 2 with S/H was less then
buying 1 local. So I have an extra for my '75. Also I
went to Napa and bought a 3 speed switch, so I have
high, medium, and low speeds. 

Another thing I have done to the '78 westy was put
some dryer vent hose on my blower above the engine,
and cut a hole in the rear access door(I had an extra
from a parts bus, so in summer I can put it back to
stock.) for a recirculater.

So far It is working good. It keeps my windows clear,
But I don't know how it works for the rear passangers.
Because I never have passangers except my dog, but she
never complains.
