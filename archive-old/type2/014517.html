Subject: Fix that suicide cabinet on your westies

Please don't cut up these precious cabinets to make visible the 'blind
spots'.  Simply adjust BOTH of your side view mirrors:

For the driver's mirror, place your head next to the door glass and
adjust the mirror so that you just see the left side of the bus.  (You
may need to turn the window down, and place your head next to where the
door glass use to be!!)

For the passenger's mirror, place your head right between the front
seats at its normal level.  Just move your head 1.5 feet to the right.
Adjust the passenger side mirror so that you just see the right side of
the bus.

Now you can catch the blind spot areas.  Even works on other cars.

On my '78 Westy, I replaced my rear view mirror with a larger, early
model Vanagon rear view mirror. Now I can see out my right rear quarter
window (where the '73's cabinet is) without moving my head.  And I get a
better view on what's happening in the rear seat with my two kids.
