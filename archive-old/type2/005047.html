&gt;It is a total fabrication.  He was mad because I wouldn't let him stay.  We
&gt;were closed because we had no water because of broken pipes.  We had the
&gt;gate closed and secured.  He entered without asking.  There was no gun.  Bob

&gt;&gt;Mr. White-
&gt;&gt;Please explain the use of weapons as regards &quot; discourage tresspassing &quot;
&gt;&gt;in a family campground. Does your campground have any national affiliation?
&gt;&gt;Is there any policy regarding the use of firearms in a public facility ?
