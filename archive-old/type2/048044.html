Subject: [T2] Second annual Missouri Bus Fallout Nov. 3-5 2000 THIS WEEKEND!

Hello,

The Missouri Bus Fallout is this coming weekend! (sorry for the error on 
the date in the last posting, the campout is friday through sunday NOT
saturday through monday...) There will be no planned events, this is a
relaxing chance to enjoy fall foliage and chat about busses, life, the
universe, and everything.

the weather looks to be excellent according to weather_dot_com... partly
cloudy highs in the mid 60's lows in the mid 40's... forecast here:

http://www.weather_dot_com/weather/cities/us_mo_troy.html

directions and specifics can be found at:

http://zarf_dot_org/~jester/fallout.htm

For the web-less among you:
the campout will be just outside of Troy, MO

Basically, take whatever route works best for you to get to highway 61,
Highway 61 intersects with highway 70 about 1/2 hour west of saint louis
MO. once on 61 head north to troy and take the highway 47 exit, head
east. A few miles down the road take a left into the State park on Highway
147 (mapquest has the number wrong in their database...)  We should be
there by later Friday afternoon, to early friday evening. if you beat us
there, just set up and we will be along shortly! 

Camping is reasonably priced, $6 for standard, and $12 for electric.  They
will let people double and sometimes even triple up on campsites, so you
can get by pretty cheaply for the weekend with 2-3 busses on one site. 

This event was a lot of fun last year and we look forward to seeing
everyone again, and meeting new people as well. There has been plenty of
rain lately so there should be no fire-ban in effect, bring firewood and
we can get nice and toasty by the bonfire... (i'll bring some, but more is
always good.)

thank you,

Stephen White
