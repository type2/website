Dear Ken and the List,
While I never had the opportunity to meet Josh in person, he ALWAYS
responded to my posts and questions in the kindest, fairest way, even
when others may have been aggravated by me, and I feel so saddened by
this happening in such a needless way.  It's so strange, because I was
just thinking about him and several other listees that haven't posted
in awhile and wondering how he was doing.  I'll remember him as the
one who gently instructed me in the ways of the list, and to post
where I was from so people would all feel more close on the list.
Though he'll never know how I feel, I just needed to post this in
memory of his kind heart, and wish that he hadn't felt the need to
take his own life.  Ken, if you have access to the family, please add
me to the list of mourners. Peace be with Josh and his family.
With much sadness,
Michele Putman
