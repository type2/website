Al,

Rant away!  A month ago, a guy had a gas leak under his motorhome
(sorry, not a VW, but safety is for everybody!).  He pulled into
a hanger he had rented and closed it up.  He was using an incadesent
shop hand light (trouble light?), he found his leak, but he dropped
the light and broke the bulb.  It lit off the gas and burned the
whole building to the ground, killing him.

&gt; My ranting about this may be a bit tiresome, but if we never had to hear
&gt; about another list member being in the hospital with burns or dead like
&gt; that guy in the UK it will be worth it.
&gt; PLEASE CONSIDER WHAT CAN GO WRONG BEFORE WORKING WITH GASOLINE OR FIRE!!
