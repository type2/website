&gt; Check the archives.  There are several great posts on the geniusness of 
&gt; the VW cooling system and how all the parts work in unison.  I even 
&gt; transfered the small square tin pieces that attach to the middle of the 
&gt; head by tabs between the fins.  the thermostat rod passes right through
&gt; one on the passenger side.

These tin pieces are critical to the life of your engine!  What they do is
keep the flow of cooling air in the fins rather than letting it spill our
the bottom of the engine.  If they aren't present, the cylinders will
develop hot spots.
