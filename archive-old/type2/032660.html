Subject: Re: rear shock absorber removal

Robert,

Since I just replaced the rear shocks on my loaf, this scenario is still fresh
in my mind:  (assuming at least 74-79 is configured the same) The upper bolts
screw into integral threaded brackets that you can't see from the outside.  My
guess is that either the bolt or bracket is partially stripped - try pulling
the bolt out as far as it will go, then shim it tight between the bolt head and
body, back it out a little more, re-shim, back out, etc. until the threads bite
or the bolt is all the way out.  

Best o' luck to ya ..

&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt; I am attempting to replace the rear shocks on my '79 Bus and I've run
&gt; into a little problem.
&gt; 
&gt; The upper bolt attaching the right rear shock is turning loosely and
&gt; will not come out. I tried to find the other end of the bolt, figuring
&gt; there'd be a nut I could put a wrench on, but I haven't been able to
&gt; locate it. The bolt seems to go into the side of the wheel well
&gt; approximately where the gas tank is located. Does anyone know how to get
&gt; at the other end of the bolt? Do I have to take the gas tank out?
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, there may not be a nut on the end of the bolt, and the bolt
&gt; may instead turn into some portion of a body member which has given out.
&gt; If that is the case, does anyone know a work-around? Any advice will be
&gt; greatly appreciated.
