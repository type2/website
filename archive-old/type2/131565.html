Subject: RE: [T2] Tank Rust after firewall pull.

I was going to do the Muriatic acid, but I don't want to now if I will have 
to seal it right away, too. I was wondering about putting some type of 
lubricant or something in there until I replace it and fill it up with fuel. 
ie WD-40, marvel Mystery Oil, Sea Foam, Snake Oil.

&gt;From: &quot;Christopher M. Gause&quot; For the inside I read SOMEWHERE to use 
&gt;LYE(drano) and Water in the tank
&gt;(after plugging all holes) and putting in some sand, gravel, or chains
&gt;and rotating it around. The lye turns the rust into something else.
&gt;Might wanna check the archive for &quot;LYE&quot; or something.
