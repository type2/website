Subject: exhasut stud woes... any ideas?

------=_NextPart_000_000B_01C15A49.54698B00
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

rebuilding an 1800... it's on the floor now (took it off the bench to =
get the exhaust and clutch on and get ready to put it in) and as i put =
the exhaust header (75 - the one with the two part heat =
exchanger/header) on i noticed the studs were a bit off center but only =
a bit (rebuilt head from a great shop up here in seattle - northwest =
connecting rods if anyone needs good machine work done) the header went =
on with a little tapping - not even enough to damge the threads... =
BUT...

two of the studs were helicoiled... so i put a bolt on one of them =
(along with bolting the other three) and when i turned it in i started =
meeting a bit of resistance and then none at all and pulled the stud =
out... so i pulled the header back off and sure enough the helicoil had =
disintegrated into bits and peices (there's a couple peices of thread =
left on the stud even)...

so i'm thoroughly frustrated and had a couple questions...

first - i figure i've answered it already from reading through the =
archive but can you get a good seal with only three nuts/studs?

second - how hard is it to tap and insert a stud straight and do it =
right, and any advice for the process? i've done spark plugs, but =
they're relatively easy to keep straight and guided... i suppose there's =
no reason this should be different... regardless i'm hoping i can do it =
with the engine still together on the ground cause i just spent two days =
putting it all back together after a long rebuild and i'm in agony at =
the thought of taking the head back off to bring to NWCR

thanks!

bill
