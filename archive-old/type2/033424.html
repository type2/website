&gt;    Anyway, to the purpose of this posting-why are the bay busses so lowly
&gt;regarded by the rest of the VW enthusiasts?

This is true of all collectable marques. It is always the crowd with the 
distinctively older vehicles who organize and create the culture, simply 
because they get there first. Owners of ’49 MGTCs look their nose down at 
owners of ’53 TDs who look their noses down at owners of ’57 MGAs who 
look their noses down at owners of MGBs. And older MGBs are more sought 
out than later Bs.

The ultimate bus to own, from a collector’s point of view, is a barndoor, 
followed by a Westy SO-23. It’s all downhill from there. Look at our 
attitude toward oozers: would you want to belong to a club that let 
wasserboxers in?

Even if there were greater participation of baywindow owners in the 
collecting culture, the owners of 69s-71s would cop an attitude toward 
later bays. A 1700 would be worthier than an 1800, and a two liter would 
be beyond the pale. 

In some ways we are better off without all this silly snottiness.
