From: &quot;David Schwarze&quot; &lt;schwarze_at_mail.ev1_dot_net&gt;
&gt; First of all, it's difficult/impossible to tell that a bottle has been
refilled.  Just refrain from refilling the bottles while you're driving next
to police cars` 'kay?  :)

Well, it's been more than 2 decades since I ran into that situation, and
come to think of it, it may have been a complete ban on propane bottles
period through that one particular tunnel out west (from here) someplace.

My bad; probably lost the details on that experience a long with a few worn
out brain cells.
