Subject: Re: Bus for all seasons window stickers... 

&gt;  what other bus-for- all-seasons window stickers should we be 
&gt;  collecting, to keep all the bases covered?

Once upon a time...

In a late night conversation over a goodly amount of red wine, 
I recounted to a friend my fruitless longtime search for &quot;the 
one bumper sticker that says it all.&quot; I'd been looking for 
years and was still looking.
 
I had this half-baked notion that my whole world view could be
encapsulated in one poignant little slogan that I wouldn't mind 
letting every gun-toting California weirdo who ever got stuck behind 
me in traffic read. Something that might provoke thought 
but not vandalism, drive by shootings, or extra traffic tickets. 
Something a little flippant and challenging that wouldn't piss off the 
cops or help get my ass kicked in a parking lot.   

I figured if I was open to the possibility, I'd know this sticker 
when I saw it and just buy the mother. Maybe at a swapmeet. But I'd 
been looking for years and still nothing I'd seen appealed to me 
enough to wear. I'm pretty picky.

My friend poured more wine and ingenuously called my bluff with the
big question I'd never really addressed: &quot;So what would this sticker say?&quot;

It took me a couple of seconds to engage my mental gears. 
Then I blurted out, &quot;ONE MORE MUSICIAN FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY.&quot;

And, bless her soul, my friend made it for me with nice rub-on letters
and contact paper. I slapped it on my bumper in a parking lot in Utah during
a cross country move to begin a new life in another state.

I drove it around for 8 years. Once a puzzled woman asked me if it meant 
I was in favor of &quot;mixed marriages.&quot; I smiled and said, &quot;Um, not really.
But I am!&quot;  I'm thinking of making a new one to grace the bumper of my bus,
but I have a sense that a new slogan will occur to me soon. I'd probably
think of it sooner if I drank more red wine.

Mean people DO suck,

PS- Another bumper sticker has recently become a household 
expression my wife and I throw around a lot: GIRLS KICK ASS!
