&gt; Anyone out there rebuild steering boxes? Quite a chunk of change to
buy a new rebuild.

&gt; Mine has that horrible popping sound. and lots of play; haven't
messed with the adjusting screw, though can't account for what the
previous owner(s) did.

Rebuilds are expensive because the part the fails is the worm and peg,
and fabricating new worms and pegs requires a hefty investment in
machining and heat-treating.  Once the parts are in hand, the labor of
assembling the thing isn't much.  For this reason, it really isn't
practical to rebuild them yourself unless your worm-and-peg are good.
