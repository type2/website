Subject: Early BN4

Good morning everyone,
	I've spent the last month scouring the site for tech info on the early BN4 
that came with bus, (many, many thanks to Ron Van Ness and others for their 
postings - pure gold) I followed the articles carefully; I repaired, 
replaced and restored everything, and the belch test wheezed and coughed the 
old heater into action. I left it running for a half hour to be sure and 
tuned the mix - Can you imagine the joy of getting sweet heat from what once 
was a pile of wires and cracked gaskets? - But installed in the van, all 
hooked up, I get blower, spark, glow plug and regulator coil, but *no pump*. 
I was a bit cautious about leaving it going with nothing happening, so i 
shut it down and went carefull over all the possibilities. Should I wait a 
little longer?
Does the pump kick in after things have warmed up for a few minutes?
Is there anything else I have to attend to at the dash? Someone mentioned to 
me that his red heater cable knobs had to be be activated before his heater 
would work. Ever heard of that one?
	I'm pretty grateful for Ron's help, so if anyone over here in Vancouver 
wants heat (we'd rather have *dry*), I'd be glad to help them with it.
