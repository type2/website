Subject: SC Sighting 

Just watched Curious George with the family. 
Towards the end, The Man in the Yellow Hat gets into a VW (Clearly labeled)
that looks like a car in the SC style.  It was oddly shaped into a SC, but
it caught my eye.  He jumps it into a Cruise Ship's Swimming pool.
 
ps: It's a fun movie to take the kids to.  All the kids in the theater
laughed at all the right spots.  It was fun to listen to their comments
throughout the movie too.
