Subject: Re: [T2] Driving in the Snow

One of the best tips I ever got about driving a bus in the snow is... &quot;Act like
there are eggs underneath the pedals and you don't want to break them&quot;  Just go
real easy on the pedals...don't slam on the brakes or accelerator...  downshift
while braking if its really slick out.  Last year I drove about 100 miles in a
blizzard to go look at a Binz.... it was kind of scary...but worth it :-)
But keep in mind that I live in WI... and nothing closes until we get quite a
bit of snow...  from what I hear from other listees out in the western states...
if a couple inches of snow is had...people freak out and the town basically
shuts down.  I guess its just where you live....
