Subject: Re: [T2] Karl Von Salzen - that bad guy!

To chime in here: Most people on the list have had advice and help from
Karl, and the thanks and praise are deserved. He is also fun to be around at
the car shows, and is easy to talk to. And, not taking anything away from
Karl, there are MANY people on the list that do the same thing, giving
advice, giving up and/or selling parts, sometimes just for postage, mostly
at a good price, just to help out.
 As one of the list people said, when he sent me a free laminated wiring
diagram, and refused any money, &quot;Just do something nice for someone when you
can.&quot; That says a lot. Some good people in the world, and on our list.

&gt; you want it&quot; after telling me what part I actually needed
