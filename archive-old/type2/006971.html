Subject: New fuel injectors?



Our 1976 2000ccFI motor started loosing power and developed a rough idle. 
Pulling the #3 wire off the distributor made no difference in the way it ran, 
and the#4 seemed to make only a little change in the idling. New spark plugs 
made no difference, but then I replaced the fuel injectors with new ones and 
now she runs like a charm again!
All the fuel injectors were originals with 179,000 miles on them...
The question: Should the other two be replaced? Senior advisor says leave 
them alone, the engine runs fine as is. Gut feeling says get new ones for the 
other side too.
Experienced opinions please?
Thanks, Bucket
