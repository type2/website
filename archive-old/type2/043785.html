South Africa and Australia I don't know about.  According to what I see on
the web, all Austrailian loafs have Rover V8s. :)

I say:-

Hi All,

I wish this were true (The Australian Rover V8 myth ;) ) Because then I
could get a clutch that could cope for a reasonable price, but seriously
there are a LOT of converted buses down here, my Rover V8 included (230hp
4.4lt) but most of them are 3.8lt V6's based on the old skylark engine
except way more modern with fuel injection etc (Holden Commodore for those
who know what this is) trouble is it's a cast iron block so it's heavy
compared to my big cubed alloy blocked engine :)

Our registration laws are fairly precise and make it easy for someone to get
a modified bus on the road if they follow ALL of the rules.

If you wanna see some checkout my Wild VW site at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/motorcity/garage/1811 or my baja Bus site at

Cheers
Steve
