Subject: Re: [T2] Thanks, Re:Lack of Confidence in Van,

Well once you bring children into the story then yes - for me too - the 
worry factor goes way,way up! I know what you mean....

&gt;It also helps to know that there is a good chance I could drive the van
&gt;with the valve seat problem, even tho it would probably not be the first
&gt;choice, it still beats being stuck in the middle of nowhere with my
&gt;children, and having no options. Ever notice how the places where you
&gt;would most likely break down or be stuck are places without cell phone
&gt;coverage? :-) They ought to do something about that......

Replace those rubber hoses too - all of them - my other paranoia... &lt;grin&gt;

Have fun.
