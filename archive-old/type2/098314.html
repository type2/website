&gt; Well, it looks like the engine in my '72

&gt; I've been giving some thought to replacing it
&gt; with something that has a 
&gt; little more power. 

Most diesels here in amerikuh are 1.6 NAs and
they would not be a power improvement.  I don't
think we got the 1.6TD or 1.9NA.  1.9TDs and
1.9TDIs are available, but very costly when you
find one.
