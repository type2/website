I've used George's method several times.  It always works for me. 
One thing I always do so that I don't have to do it again on the same
adjuster is to thinly coat the star, bolt and cup that the star goes
in with high temperature grease.  There's supposed to be a special
lubricant for brakes but I've never tried it.  Use it sparingly.  You
don't want to have it drip on to the drums and shoes.

That thin coat of grease is real important if you used Liquid Wrench
to loosen the adjusters.  Liquid Wrench acts like a solvent and
removes all the surface oil ensuring that the adjuster will rust
tight if you don't coat the surfaces with a true lubricant.  Don't
use Liquid Wrench to loosen the stars without removing the drum and
lubricating the parts.  Big mistake.  BTDT.

&gt;Hey George.
&gt;I dont know about the others stars but the bolts on mine where 
&gt;frozen 
&gt;too, would not budge. Good idea tho.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Get a bolt longer than the adjusting bolt with the same thread.  
&gt;Take out
&gt;&gt;the adjusting bolt and stuff the hole full of grease.  Thread the 
&gt;long
&gt;&gt;bolt in and one of two things will likely happen:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;1. The hydraulic pressure in the grease will push the adjuster out.
&gt;&gt;2. The bolt will bottom and continued torqueing will push the 
&gt;adjuster
&gt;&gt;out.
