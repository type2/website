Subject: Bus People

There are some people who aren't going to like this, but oh well.  It's not
directed at any particular person, just some observations I've made
over the past few years.

My VW career is still fairly young.  I bought my first bug in '85, my first
bus in '93, and have only had 3 non-VW cars: an MG which lasted 1 day before
throwing a rod (a definite sign!) and two Porsche 911's.

&quot;Bus People&quot; are a class of &quot;VW People&quot;, which are derived from &quot;Car People&quot;
(constructor and destructor methods will be discussed in another article,
but are applicable)

There are two high-level types of &quot;car people&quot; - those who do it for fun, 
and those who do it for money.  They are not mutually exclusive, and if you 
were to construct a Yourdon diagram, each person's overlap area would be
somewhat different.   It doesn't matter if you're talking about Duesenbergs
or BMW Isettas, the relationships are the same.

To expand on this further:

* Some of your bus people just happen to be bus people because that's what
fate has thrust in front of them.  They needed a car that ran, they ended 
up with a bus.  Their cars are usually bone stock, original paint.  These
buses are sought after because of their general unmolested originality.

* Some of them are into the &quot;bus thing&quot; which generally is an adaptation of
the &quot;hippie thing&quot; which means driving around, having a good time, partying,
exploring, whatnot.  Their cars tend to have wild paintjobs, functional
mods (cut wheel wells, huge tires, external oil coolers) that ensure
reliability, with no regards to keeping it original.

* Some people are into the bus thing for the bus themselves.  They strive to
collect the buses for buses, to dissect, rebuild and gather as much
knowledge as they can.  These are the people who do the restorations,
decry anything that doesn't look stock, and pay $400 for ambulance fans.

* some people are into buses 'cause it's the latest fad.  Last week
they were into american muscle, next week it will be model t's.  They
have huge amounts of cash, and &quot;buy&quot; their restorations, or just buy
the nice restored cars outright.  They drive SUV's, and the VW's only
come out for a) shows, to be rolled onto a trailer; b) when the
magazine photographer shows up.  They buy the cars as an investment,
and something to show to their friends.  Who else would pay $40k for a
deluxe?

* Some people are into buses because they see a pecuniary opportunity.  They
scour the planet in search of stuff to sell.  Everything that leaves their
fingers must bring a profit, or it doesn't go.  They usually show up with
a late-model pickup loaded with expensive parts.  Everything they have
is made from solid unobtainium.   On the flip side, they have to buy
everything cheep-cheep so they can turn a profit.  I had one of these
guys tell me an early convertible engine lid was only worth $25
because of a couple dents in it.  A normal person probably would have
taken him at his word based on his reputation, but I knew better.

These types are not limited to buses.  There are people like these
in every automotive group, with the possible exception of Skoda,
which nobody likes (JK!)

Everyone has a mix of these traits, with the percentages varying from person
to person.  The percentages are not fixed, and they'll vary from time to
time, day to day.

So what's the problem?  Each of the bus &quot;archetypes&quot; has a certain amount
of resentment towards the others.  This creates an internal stuggle for 
some, and confrontation for others.  The hippy people aren't happy with
the people they think are gouging them for basic parts.  The resto people
cringe at seeing the hippy people cut up buses.  The resto people rail at
the seller people for charging an arm and a leg for the accesories they
want.

I don't know what anyone would have against the first group, but there's 
probably something.

One problem I'm seeing is that there are people who may think they're in
one group, but appear to everyone else to be in another.  This 
dichotomy may not rest well with the &quot;everyone else&quot;  For example, you 
have the &quot;yuppie&quot; types who buy a bus to play hippie on the weekends 
(much the same way that you have lawyers who buy harleys and dress up
in leather on Sunday afternoons).   I won't go into all of the other
permutations, but you can mix and match and come up with some yourselves.

With *bus* people, these differences are quite acute, because there
are a lot of stereotypes that go along with the archetypes.  Ok, that's
redundant.  By contrast, there never have been any poor, scrapped out,
Porsche people.    So you don't have one guy that others think is
&quot;posing&quot; since the social stratas and archetypes are not as far apart.

Another statement that I'll make, which will get me burned at the stake:

There's a fine line between business and pleasure.  One must always
be cognizant of which of these they are endeavoring in at a given time.
This applies to VW's, office entanglements, dealing with corporate recruiters,
just about anything where fun and money mix.   I've found that many 
will deliberately blur the line to their advantage, like the consulting 
company recruiter who wears the low cut blouse and takes you out to 
dinner hoping you'll lower your salary expectations.  These are also the 
same people who act the most offended when you don't play the game by their 
rules.
