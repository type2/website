Subject: Back from NY, 73 Euro Panel is home
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I got home this afternoon from my 1000+ mile trip to bring home my ebay bus, 
the '73 European panel.

The bus drove great and I had few problems.  All this considering the bus 
hasn't been driven for about 10 years.

I'll post more details later, but the Euro panel bus is a bit odd in 
comparison to my '74 US spec camper.  I have not looked over many '73 buses, 
let alone panel vans, but this one has a metal dash, different door handles, 
and a dual-port type1 motor, just to name a few of the differences.  It also 
still has the original euro headlights.  There are no side marker lights and 
the only thing I think was changed out was the speedometer.  It has a very 
cool tripmeter and the odometer reads into the over 100K digits.  Too bad 
neither works.  

Anyone know where I can get the dash clock and odometer fixed?

This bus needs lots of work.  The rockers are shot along with the doglegs.  I 
think it is well worth restoring, but it may take awhile to get it finished.  
At least for now I can drive it.
