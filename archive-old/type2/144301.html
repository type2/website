&gt; the engine a bit and away it went. I parked at my work and walked

&gt; outside is only about 85 so I don't think that it is my oil breaking
&gt; down. My oil drain plug looks dry so I am not sure where the drip is
&gt; coming from. This is a 1600dp in a 71 Westfalia. The entire engine

I don't suppose at some point recently you have adjusted your valves?
You could have not gotten one of the valve covers seated properly
causing a small oil leak. Whatever you do, before leaving check your
oil level, top it off, and make sure you have a lot of extra oil.
