    &gt;While driving the freeway to work this morning, the brake

    &gt;then would come back on again after driving a moment.
    &gt;Got to work ok, opened up Muir's book to find nothing
    &gt;regarding this problem (he mentions the warning light
    &gt;coming on while braking), any ideas?
    
Pat brought up the stuff about how the thing is SUPPOSED to work, 
but it could be (is in mine, anyway) that the warning light is FUBAR.
Mine will come on from time to time, and if I tap it, it will go out
again.  It was designed so that you could press the lamp and it would 
ground itself, testing the bulb. In mine, the spring is gone, so it 
just sits there in the socket and vibration will ground it out from 
time to time.

If it comes on while braking, that's another story...mine always goes
out as soon as the brakes are applied.
