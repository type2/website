Subject: splittie model sighting

Can't believe VW nostalgia has gone MAINSTREAM - while at a clothing chain
just for teen &amp; under girls called The Limited Too (check your local mall)-
they had bins of bug paraphernalia (pencils, keychains, springloaded
rolling models, etc). and SPLITTIE BUSES!  Not too shabby for $3.50-5.50-
they had a metal one with the 60's V paint job in front, but SLIDING cargo
door -did any actually have this?  For $5.00 the bugs had doors and hood
that opened.   Never would have believed it.
