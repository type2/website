Subject: 70 bus for sale

I saw and ad stating a 70 bus for sale. &quot;in storage 20 years&quot;???

Called today. Belonged to grandfather. Guy said &quot; I am 22 years old and was
in the garage since I was born&quot;. He has been driving it for a year. Anybody
have any interest?

 I am going to look this weekend, but just to see what it looks like (what I
tell my wifey).

46k. White over red.
