Subject: Windshield Wiper Tank/Hose Leak

upon charging up my windshield wiper tank in my '71 Westy after the
winter, I heard a leak and hiss from behind the kick panels - I dove in
there and found that the hose leading from the windshield wiper fluid tank
was cracked and broken, and in need of replacement. However, it leads up
under a maze of stuff in the dash and disappears... No diagrams or mention
in Bentley or Muir.

Is this an easy thing to do, replacing the hose? It looks like it isn't... 

thanks! 
Dan Curran
