&gt; Can anyone fill me in on my airconditioning? This has a large compressor? on
&gt; the drivers side of the engine compartment when you open the rear lid, and a
&gt; complex vent system attached under the main dash up front. There are 6 (I
&gt; believe) adjustable vents on this system with a min/off/max knob on the left
&gt; side, and a temp? knob to the right. It does not appear to be working, but
&gt; blows lots of air. :-) I didn't notice a belt to the compressor, how does
&gt; this thing work?

it doesn't !

OK, the belt to the compressor goes behind the belt to the alt, and runs
behind the air box, there is a small pulley behind the fanhub...it has got
to be the hardest belt to put on I have ever run across, it is also an odd
size if I recall....there should be a number of &quot;Radiator&quot; like things
under your bus, 3 if I remember, one under the front and two more on the
drivers side under the floor (at least on my 78) there should be some
heavy hoses connecting this all together.

the hoses are probably suspect and I would replace all of em, don't buy
new ones but have those ends put on new hose. much cheaper, find a truck
hydralic place they will do it...the clutch on the compressor is probably
bad, and the dryer has probably gotten too much air into it....also the
R-12 refrigerant that it used is no longer (legally) made in this country
so it is outragiously expensive now...
