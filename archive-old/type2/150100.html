Subject: RE: [T2] Steve Dolan is right again.  Was Fuel pump runs and
  runs

Andrew, I had a similar problem when I put in my new engine (rebuilt
2.0L FI in '76 Westy).  I had intermittent no-fuel-from-the-pump
conditions.  I would check the voltage at the pump when cranking, and it
was erratic - sometimes 0, and sometimes up to about 3 volts.  Finally
traced it back to the wiring harness plug (driver's side plug) on the
double relay - one of the contacts inside the plug was sliding down when
I would connect the plug to the relay.  It was one of the 88 contacts on
Richard's double relay page
(http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/DoubleRelay.html).  It was a red wire,
providing power to the pump during startup.  I used a small flat
screwdriver to push the contact (female blade-type) back up inside the
plug (while plug was connected) in order to make it slide onto the male
blade on the relay.  Got voltage to the pump, got fuel to the 3/4 rail
(had hose disconnected to test flow), hooked it up and bus started!

Might be something to check - just make sure all the female contacts
inside your plugs are connecting to the relay and not sliding down away
from it.

HTH!

Steve sugggested I check the ground circuits at both the pump / relay,
and the transmission ground strap.  I cleaned both and the bus still
wont start, probabably because no fuel pressure.  My next step is to
check for voltage at the pump itself and replace the wiring, and/or swap
out the pump (again).

Any suggestions?
