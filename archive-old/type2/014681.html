The cream colored stuff under the oil filler cap is 
Salad Dressing IE: Oil and water mixed.
If you driver short trips it builds up as the oil doesn't 
get hot enough to drive the moisture off.

Calibrating speedo. Have friend follow in another car.
Tell him  you will go 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 for a ways at each speed.
Have him mark down his readings of the constant speed sections.
Or you follow him, and mark what you read.
I've done this with my wife with her driving both other cars, and
all three speedos match pretty closely with each other. 

Cheers
