&gt; Anyone out there know a rough estimate of how much new ball joints will set

Depends :-)  

New ball joints (German) from Bus Depot are $16.95
(http://www.busdepot_dot_com, part number 211 405 371A)  You need 4, so figure
$68 for a set.  Then you need to remove the trailing arms, press the old
ball joints out and press the new ones in. Then reinstall the trailing
arms. So it can be as low as $68 plus a front-end alignment.

If you have not got a press, you can remove the arms and take them to a
machine shop, where they will do the press work for ~$100 *or* you can buy
rebuilt trailing arms from bus boys for $174.95 +$50 core
(http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbbjarms2.htm). This would make the cost about
$200 (varying with shipping and/or cost of the machinist).

Or you can pay someone to pull and put the trailing arms, which would
probably be in the $200-300 range, plus $200 for rebuilding the arms, for
a total cost of ~$400-500.

The more work you do, the less it costs, but you are trading time for
money (aren't we all? :-)
