Hi All,
    The spirit of a Merry Christmas to you all, even if it's not your
holiday.

A few messages back Tom asked...&quot;What are some of your favorite
electronic mods???  Keyless entry, lighting, sound/entertainment
systems...????&quot;....

    I know mine would be an electric window for the right side, front
door window.  Of course while I was at it I'd probably do the drivers
window just so they match.  An even better mod would be to find a way
that those windows could be manually and/or electrically operated!
