Subject: RE: [T2] This guy should be horse whipped......

Yeah, that one is pretty bad, but I have seen worse (like folks that paint
crappy flower child symbols all over their vans 35 years too late). Probably
a kid who lost interest and money and is trying to get what he/she put into
it. We all know that isn't possible so the reserve is this person's naoveti
kicking in.

It is unfortunate that the person who painted it did such a lousy job. If
the next owner is serious about it, he/she will have to do a lot of work to
get it back to its original color, which looks to be white. Painting over
the wiring harness, over spraying on the engine and frame and not taping the
door jambs is really not acceptable for any body professional, even Maaco.

The Westy interior belongs in a Westy. If you want a Weekender, buy one or
convert it right. Not to be an elitist artist, but that pattern matched with
red exterior and grey panels brings me to tears.

I agree, this is at most a $1500 bus with more than $3K to get it back to
normal. $5K if you are going to put it back to stock color because you would
need to clean up that horrendous paintjob.

But of course we are purists.

My hope is whoever buys this person's project; they will get it back on the
road where it belongs. At least it will be out of the hands of the
well-meaning previous owner...
