Subject: [T2] 71 Westy Stuff Needed

Looking for the following for my 71 Westy:

Icebox/sink cabinet unit - I have a functional unit from a 72, but the
finish doesn't match the rest of my cabinets, and a family of mice spent

alot of time in there before I reclaimed it from the donor bus, so it
smells like...... mice!  So what I really need is the wood parts only -
I could swap the sink, tank, plumbing etc in from the unit I already
have.

Rear bumper:  Needs to be straight - condition of paint and surface rust

are not important.

Interior light complete:  The thing in the back with 3 bulbs and 2
switches.

I live in the southeastern PA area, but wouldn't mind traveling a
reasonable distance to pick up the above.
