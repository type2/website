Subject: Re: [T2] 72 fuel line diagram

Paul, the tube just 'drains' into the hole in the lower cover plate.  It does not connect to anything and does not carry fuel.
Fuel lines go from tank to pump- then pump through breast plate to carbs via tee and possible regulator.

Anyhow, my question is this: After filling my tank for the first time, I
notcied that I had a significant fuel leak. When I got under the right side
of the bus, I noticed that one of the lines coming off of the fuel pump was
only about 4 inches long and not connected to anything. I hadn't noticed it
because it ran through that 1' by 1' metal cover plate. Any ideas what that
line should be connected to? Like I said, I'm so clueless with all of this
and you guys are my teachers. Also, does anybody have a detailed fuel line
diagram for a '72?
