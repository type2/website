Subject: What is a fair price 4 VW aux gas heater

Hey all,
A former neighbor is town for a day, he has an original VW gas heater.
It is located in the engine compartment, it is a type 4. It is round,
looks a bit like one of those propane blowers on the sidelines of
outdoor football games. He is willing to sell it to me, but I haven't a
clue what to offer him. Any idea of the value? Thanks,
Scoob
