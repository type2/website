Electrical is definitely my LEAST favorite thing to
work on, and I am certainly no expert (I don't even
play one on TV) But I am fairly confident in saying
that 12V at your steering column falls into the &quot;bad
thing&quot; category.  I just recently had a similiar
experiece in my 71. I noticed that the backing lights
and tail lights were staying on all the time, EVEN
WHEN I UNPLUGGED them! Weird, VERY weird!! Anyway,
what had happened was that the hot wire going to my
12V power outlet and my gas heater from my auxiliary
battery had a worn spot in the insulation that allowed
the electrified wire to touch the metal of the body,
thus giving the body a charge, since the metal
housings on the lights were touching the body, they
were actually powering up and burning from it!!
Anyway, my guess about your problem is that you have a
live wire, possibly from the ignition switch, that is
coming into contact with the column.  When you have a
bad iginition switch, my experince has shown that a
LOT of weird things can be the result, because so many
things receive power through this switch. The
headlight switch also sends power to a lot of
different things, so if either of these go wonky on
you, the the electrical gremlins can really multiply!!
