Subject: '82 Vanagon won't start..mystery solved???

With some help from a good mechanic friend I was able to get my Vanagon
started and it seems to run fine now.  By the time my friend Dan came along
I was ready to swap out the whole system for the FI system on my '80...and
put my carb system on the '80.  Dan was willing but wanted to go over all
the diagnostics with me first.  I had gone through the Bentley decision tree
Time after time and the diagnosis seemed to be faulty wire between the
double relay and the computer. or some such idea.  Dan seemed to find the
Bentley to be ambiguous and confusing, so he ran his own system of dianosis.
Eventually we decided that the double relay was suspect so I took the one
from the '80 and put it into the '82 and the '82 ran fine.  So it was the
relay which was bad after all but I had concluded the relays were fine based
on the tests in the book.  Oh well.....

Thanks to all for the suggestions...
