&gt; my new brake shoes did not come with that emergency brake lever thing

&gt; anyway) along with it, just to have all new hardware back there?

Christopher,

Drat! I knew I would forget something!  I'm sorry, Christopher. No, new
shoes never come with the lever attached to the shoe. If you are very
lucky, the replacement shoes will come with a rivet or C-clip for
attaching the lever to them.  There are three different systems for
attaching the lever to the shoe that I have seen and no doubt a fourth and
fifth I have not.

System #1 - Pin and Clip - The original system was a pin with a groove cut
in it and a C-clip that went in the groove.  You put the pin thru the
lever and shoe then put the C-clip in the groove and squeeze it shut with
a pair of pliers.  New C-clips are available at VW or from any VWFLAPS.  I
bought new pins at  VW 4-5 years ago.  Who knows if they still carry them,
but if they do, this is my favorite system.  Original and it works well.

System #2 - Rivet - This is the usual aftermarket system. To remove, use
a drill or angle grinder and lots of light/penetrating oil.  To assemble,
a large punch or phillips screwdriver.  Apply brute force as necessary.

System #3 - Nut and Bolt - At this late date, this is probably the most
common system, but my least favorite.  I think that the bolt spec is M8x15
with appropriate nut.  After you assemble this, tho... be sure and peen
over some threads on the bolt!  Nothing makes a  panic-worthy noise like
that nut coming loose inside your drum at 60mph!! (as me how I know :-(

If you have the time/patience, I would recommend going to a VW dealer and
asking if they have the pins and clips, else use a nut and bolt.

&gt; ugh, this has been one of those projects where all of the tools are not
&gt; where I need them, I don't have all the parts I thought I had, etc.

Is there any other kind?  and remember that swearing is mandatory!

&gt; i'll get this figured out, my patience just got a little razzled today
&gt; getting hung up on one step after the other, and needed to vent a little.
&gt; thanks for listening, im sure by now your thinking &quot;... been there a few
&gt; times..&quot;

Ohyeah! :-)
