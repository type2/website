Shawn:
something is shorting and it has to do with your driving. Perhaps the wires under the
floor by the master cylinder, perhaps under the dash. Something that shorts out when the
vehicle moves. I don't think late models run the brake lites through the turn signal
switch like the type 2's 56-71, but I could be wrong. (The turn signal switch was always
a trouble spot on those cause it would move and the wires break off.)
You should be able to SEE the spot where it is shorting. I'd check the master cylinder
first.  The rest of the wires aren't even hot without the brake switches closed, so if
the fuse blows WITHOUT the pedal depressed it has to be between the switches and the
fuse.

&gt; Replace brake light fuse, all brake lights work, including the e-brake lite on dash.
&gt;
&gt; Drive for 300 ft Without Applying The Brakes!  and the fuse pops.  You can hear it.
