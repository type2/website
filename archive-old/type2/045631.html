Subject: [T2] THE ULTIMATE *V W ONLY* TRANSMISSION- PROFESSIONALS

Listees,

As some of you may know, I recently cruised up the California coast in my 71
*with a  brand new engine and transmission that I had just  installed about
a month ago*.... I was  delivering an engine and other parts *excuse to
drive the bus* to a customer in  Northern California.  Well, half way
through my trip * near San Jose California*  started hearing some really
odd, * for a 71 bus* and fairly loud, intermittent whining noises coming
from the rear.  At first I thought it was the pilot bearing,  it wasn't a
heavy enough sound for the C Vs.. Then  I noticed it was only occurring in
4th gear.  Then it happened! Started popping out of 4th gear. while under
load.  Then it didn't matter under load, or not, couldn't use 4th. at all.
Cut short my trip and returned *using highway 1 and 101* avoiding the
interstate, with just 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gears only.  What a beautiful drive
it was through Big Sur. Thanks to Cal Trans for making so many turn outs for
allowing me to get out of way of the Subs and BMWs that were in a hurry to
have fun, fun, fun.... and Thanks to the really cool Monterey County Sheriff
who stopped me to offer help and advice, ah hum...

Called my transmission pro's today * RANCHO PERFORMANCE TRANSAXLES at:
800-30-4trans* spoke to the owner *SAM*.. I explained  what happened.  He
said, Bob, WHAT EVER WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY,  WE WILL  DO IT FOR YOU.  Well, I
was leaning toward having them put a 457 ring and pinion in, on one of my
next trany rebuilds to give me a little taller 4th gear.  He said, YOU GOT
IT..... What a Cool Company, making it right, giving me something extra for
my trouble, and, keeping a Happy customer.

Bob, Who's looking forward to soon having a really Phat trany for the Free
Bus
