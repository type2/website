Subject: Re: Squeak, squeak cure?

Well, I LOVE these kinds of discussions, nobody agrees with anybody 
else ! ! ! The replies to date:

&gt; I have tried spraying all kinds of stuff everywhere on the
&gt; suspension I can, and nothing has made a bit off difference.

&gt; You can take the bushings out and grease those pups.  Should fix the
&gt; problem for oh, a little while or so.  Probably better to replace them.
&gt; Polyurethane bushings squeak really bad (i.e. &quot;high performance&quot;
&gt; bushings).  Buy the stock rubber ones from the dealer.

&gt; I . . am leary of putting grease on rubber.
&gt; Some compositions will take it and quiet right down, others turn to
&gt; sticky black paste.  VW recommends talc for the rear bushing and that is
&gt; what I would try first on the fronts as well.

&gt; try a powdered graphite based lube, or a silicone spray.

&gt; I have squirted a little washing-up liquid onto such problems
&gt; and they have gone away - several times over the last 9 years.  They
&gt; started again last week so must try again..  

While buying fan belts for my Subaru last night I asked the mechanic 
his opinion, WD-40 was his answer.

Another sought after opinion suggested a penetrating oil.

Another suggested a silicone spray.  Hey two answers agree ! ! this 
must be the correct one ! ! =-)

The following is starting to gel in my wasteland of a mind:
Best substance would be dry to prevent *bringing* any dirt and 
crud into the joint.  Need way to draw dry stuff into joint though.
Easiest to apply would be a penetrating oil of some sort, but some 
questions remain on the long term effect on the rubber.
Still undecided.  Sounds like a discussion of politicians, everybody 
has a different opinion, some work out, some don't.  Some are 
slipperier than others, others turn to muck.
