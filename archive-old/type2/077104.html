Subject: Re: [T2] Kadron Vacuum Source - Weber &amp; Dellorto, etc

Dear Simon.

I managed to find the article at home. It's as follows :-

Dave Cormack, Installing Gene Berg's Kadron Carb Linkage, VW Trends, 
November 2000, pages 72 to 75.

The relevant caption, from Jon Chabot of Top Line Parts, is on page 74, 
which describes and illustrates where the two vacuum connection need to be.

California, CA 92806, USA

Tel. (USA) 714 630 8371

I imagine that it would be possible in principle, to add vaccuum connections 
to almost any carburettor; including the Weber or Dellorto.

Regards.

&gt;Thanks for the tip, I'll look it up on their website.

&gt; &gt; Dear Simon
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The issue of how to create vacuum connections for the stock ignition
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; distributor, on the 40mm, dual Kadron carburettors, was covered in
&gt; &gt; some
&gt; &gt; detail, in a past issue of VW trends, dating back a few years.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a copy of the article at home somewhere, but have no way of
&gt; &gt; sending a
&gt; &gt; copy by e-mail.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         Nigel A. Skeet
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Went and installed a pair of 40mm Kadron carbs on my 1600 dp, no 
&gt;vacuum!
&gt; &gt; Do
&gt; &gt; &gt;I need to tap the carbs for a vacuum port somewhere?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; YES YOU DO
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I need to know from someone that's done this before with these carbs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; YES, IN VW TRENDS MAGAZINE
