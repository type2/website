Subject: serious side window problem/help needed

Ok, I believe I have learned over the years when it is time to call the 
professionals.

I just finished my third attempt to put in my driverside center sliding 
window on my 78 bus.

Same result as the last two tries....incredibly tight and torn seal.
I am getting a serious bummer over this one....all my other windows went 
in just like they always have on lots of other vw's...no problem.

The passenger side sliding window was very tight, but it went in.
Windows were **well* marked coming out, so I know that they are going back 
in the same way they came out.

All seals are wolfsburg west seals with the groove for the chrome.

So I started measuring openings and fit.

The *inside* metal to metal measurement on the window is 14 9/16&quot;
vertically and the horizontal measurement is 41 1/4&quot;.  This is the part
that you could actually measure with the sliding window installed

The bus metal to metal openings are 41 11/16 horizontal and verticaly
15 1/4&quot;.  Measurement of the window with the seal on it shows that
Where the seal would have to go vertically is 15 1/8&quot;...ok, so I have 
1/8&quot; vertically that the metal opening is smaller than the window seal.

Horizontally, the bus metal to metal is 41 11/16&quot;....hmmmmmm...the inside 
of the seal(where the metal will be) is 41 14/16&quot;.....*wups*...I am *long*
3/16&quot; of what I have actually fitting!!!  No wonder the ^(^&amp;*()&amp;*( thing
won't go in!!

The metal on the bus looks normal to me....not extra wide or any thing 
else.  I could probably shave some out on each vertical upright, but 
not really enough to get 3/16 + 1/8 like I have vertically...

The window/rubber *does* fit on the outside opening of the window just 
fine...if you push, it just plops right in...it is lipping the rubber over
on the inside that it eating it.....especially in the corners.

Obviously, I have vinyl installed, so am not really wanting to grind on 
the metal, but *do* have a metal nibbler.  The problem is I really don't 
think I can nibble enough away from the front an rear to even get close.

Does anyone have any suggestions???  You folks with your windows out, can 
you veryify any of these measurements?

Extremely frustrated(and getting poorer every time), dave
