Subject: weberazation

From: Hal Sullivan &lt;tristessa_at_pon_dot_net&gt;


&quot;Most Busses were converted by &quot;backyard okie&quot;
mechanics &quot;

I dont understand FI, but I have a mechanic who does.

&quot;The single Weber progressive is a horrible conversion
for the 
T4-engined Busses. . .&quot;

That was my expierence. I hated that carberator.



 &quot;The &quot;best&quot;
carb conversion is dual carbs; my Westy's
&quot;Weberiziation&quot; was done with 
a pair of 34ICT 
one-barrels.&quot;

Thats what I have. What kind of gas milage do you get?
Im getting 16 in mixed driving, 18 on the freeway.
