&gt; Sooo... would a bad EEC valve be the reason someone put the BB in the vac

I have no idea how the saturation of the charcoal filter contributes to the
air fuel ratio. I haven't tried to measure it.

The EEC test is pretty simple: try to blow into the large hose at idle and
try it again at 2000rpm.
