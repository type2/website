Subject: how would you know if ? engine rebuild ?

Hi!  I have a 78 westy with an oil consuming engine.  I know I need to replace
the cylinders and heads. (why do just the rings?)  My question is how would
one make the decision between a full rebuild and just replacing the
cylinders/pistons/heads?  If I tear it all the way down (split the case,
replace bearings, grind the crank and cam, etc...) why not buy a rebuild
engine?  I am just looking for opinions ....
TIA
