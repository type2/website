Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for ignition switch contact for 78 westy

[...]
I just removed a switch from a 78,,, it doesn't have a vw number on it...it
says germany int.pat. MWO

it only has 5 terminals ,, as terminal P is missing,, and Terminal 1 looks
to be factory flush cut off.

I noticed the picture Karl linked to have terminal differences, but I think
they interchange..
this picture http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=171905865
has the P terminal,, and another term marked G ... and the terminal marked 1
on my switch is 0 on the above link,

I dunno if that helps .. but it may fit interchange with the other vehicles
that require all the terminals,,  I think in this case... there are extra
terminals not required on the bus. The wiring diag shows  term 30, 50, 15,
X, Su  ,,, no P or G or 1 or 0 required for a late bay bus...

&gt; Mike asked:
&gt;
&gt; It's getting more and more difficult to start the car (78 westy), so I'm
&gt; thinking that the plastic electric switch that hooks onto the bottom of
&gt; the keyed ignition switch is probably cracked and slowly dying.  Does
anyone
&gt; know the part number for this part?  They have a few on BD, but I just
want
&gt; to confirm that I'm getting the right one.
&gt;
&gt;  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; ETKA shows the part number to be 111 905 865 L from 2x4 2164 060 to the
end
&gt; of 79.
&gt;
&gt; Looking up that number on Bus Depot I get 88-92 Vanagon, 74-79 Bug, Ghia,
&gt; and Sb!   http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=111905865L
&gt; Strange!
&gt;
&gt; Looking by application, you get this one:
&gt; http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=171905865
&gt; and if you look at the list on the bottom of it, it lists the ones for the
&gt; 111 905 865L switch.
&gt;
&gt; Here is the 171 905 865 switch for $13.95:
&gt; http://bluekassel_dot_com/ignition1.htm
&gt;
&gt; Other than price and manufacturer, I have no idea what the difference
is....
&gt;
&gt; Here is the 111 905 865 L for $22:
