Subject: Broken/bent steering dampner on modified 68 bus...
Date: Thu, 24 May 2001 18:43:16 -0700
	charset=&quot;utf-7&quot;

Seeking the list wisdom,

Working on a very modified 68 bus today with custom wheels. As I was about
to adjust the brakes on the right front +ACo-after pulling the wheel+ACo- noticed
that the steering damper was just hanging there loose, bent , and pulled out
of the socket on the end toward the wheel.  It was still connected on the
end toward the center pin/relay lever.  The threaded bracket that is welded
to the axle beam is totally tweaked, and will have to be straightened in
order to bolt  the new steering damper back on.  Question:  Should I just
get it +ACo-the bracket+ACo-really hot with a torch, and try and straighten/bend it
back to allow the bolt to line up, or, will that compromise/weaken the
bracket.  Is there another, better way?
