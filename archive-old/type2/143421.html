&gt; Oh and the F_at_RD was traded for a 2002 Beetle for my wife.

hello  On the new beetle be sure to have the timing belt and Waterpump 
replaced at 60K  We are seeing a lot of the pumps fail  the impellar are made of 
plastic  if it breaks it will destroy the timing belt and then bend the valves in 
the head costing a good bit to fix   Later and have fun  Mark dearing  salem
