Subject: shifter adjustment

I just can't get my shifter adjusted right. It's always been to far 
forward and hits' the e-brake
handle. I replaced all the bushings last spring except the plastic guide 
bushing in the middle. I
did inspect it and it was fine, I regreased everything then also. I 
played with the
adjustment a little this summer,but ended up leaving it cause it worked. 
 How do I get this thing
adjusted.? Any tips?

Bill
