Subject: Won't idle

Anyone out there know why a supposedly rebuilt PICT 34 won't idle? I bought 
this carb from MOFOCO, tried to put it on my 73 bug, and only ended up 
frustrating the hell out of myself. Turn the screws in, out, up, down--makes 
no difference. The thing won't even pretend to want to idle. The carb I took 
off the car does idle, but has other problems, so I don't think it's my 
timing, valves, etc. I checked for vacuum leaks and found none. I also sent 
the carb back to MOFOCO, which I've recently learned from following this 
list, is not the place you want to buy carbs, engines, etc.  They tested it 
and said it was fine. Any help would be appreciated.
