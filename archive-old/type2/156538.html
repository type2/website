Subject: Re: [T2] Weird starter solenoid

&gt; I missed the original post and already deleted it
&gt; but on my 71 solenoid, the large stud type terminal
&gt; has the black lead from the battery, a red/white
&gt; lead going to the ignition switch, and a red lead
&gt; going to the voltage regulator. The other smaller
&gt; terminal is a twin spade terminal which has the
&gt; red/black lead from the ignition switch and another
&gt; red lead that disappears into a harness. According
&gt; to the Bentley schematic, this red lead goes to a
&gt; test connector which my bus no longer has or never
&gt; had to start with. Let us know what you find.

After reading Bill's message, I have a very slight
shadow of doubt about the colors I stated, but not
about how to solve your problem. If you hook your
continuity tester to the 3rd spade terminal on your
old solenoid, you'll see it is a direct connection to
the big starter terminal and is live when the starter
terminal is live - only. -BaH
