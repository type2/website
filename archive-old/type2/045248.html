OK, here's the story so far...

The plug on three was oily and I noticed that the gusset holding inlet
manifold pipe three to the central manifold body (one dual-choke
progressive carb if you remember) was torn, so pulled the carb and the
centre and left side parts of the inlet manifold to inspect inlet
proper.  Bad news, the inlet manifold and interior of inlet valve three
are coated with a mixture of gassy oil (my dipstick smells) and alu
paste.  Whoopee.  Plus the valve guide on inlet three is free to slide
up and down the valve stem.  A quick feel showed that all tappets on
that side were OK, apart from inlet three, which has no gap at all.

A friend is going to lend me a compression tester, but I can tell what
I'm going to get on three.

It hard to tell what's cause and what's effect - the gusset could have
torn, weakened the mixture, overheated the head and bollixed everything
else up.  Or the inlet could have started blowing back for whatever
reason and the resultant shaking could have torn the gusset.

Either way, this looks like an engine-out, doesn't it?

Chris.
