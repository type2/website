Subject: Re:Re: [T2] Front Beam Question (sorry, misunderstanding on my part)

I'm sorry, but what I was refering to was the front portion of the frame.  I thought that is what is called front beam.  the whole front bar that sits under the bus's nose is badly rusted.  Can this be replaced without taking the bus off the frame (if that is possible)?  I am wondering what is entailed in this type of repair.

sorry that I was so confusing,
Kyle


Thanks,
Kyle
