Subject: Re: [T2] locking 68-71 gas cap

Has anyone out there actually tested this theory?

&gt;
&gt;for those of you looking for locking gas caps for your
&gt;68-71 busses the vw thing locking gas caps should work
&gt;being that the regular gas caps off of the mid 60's
&gt;beetles, things and 68-71 busses all use the same
&gt;caps.  they are around 50$ new and can be bought from
&gt;any of the vw thing dealers.
