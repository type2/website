I'm glad some of you folks are awake this Monday morn, of course that is
who I meant........

  have been off most of last week and doing roundtuits around the house so
didn't get in much driving, also was unreal hot and humid so bus sat all
week, needed to move it Sat evening to get to something, started right up
but this 78 was making a horrible racket?!?!?!    Sunday decided to find
out what,  couldn't put my finger on anything so took a test drive, within
about 2-3 blocks it quieted down and ran fine.?????  only thing I can
think is the lifters (hyd) bled off while it sat just haven't had it
happen like that in ages...._dot_caught me off guard...but can't find anything
wrong (well besides the stuff I already know about) soooo, &quot;open the pod
bay doors hal!&quot;
