Subject: Help! Need relay for heater booster
Message-ID: &lt;19991009191143.22632.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Hi Airs:

I finally tracked down the trouble of my Eberspacher BA6, stock heater 
booster for 79 Westies. It is one of the relays (there is quite a few of 
them...). This one is installed just behind the driver side kick panel. It 
is a two part assembly, one, the relay proper of rectangular shape with ten 
(10) contacts, bearing VW part no: 211.963.135 (12V), GERMANY, with each 
contact letter-labeled in this order: D C F A E G D+ B H K, the F A D+ B and 
H contacts are smaller than the other ones; and two, an open aluminum 
encasing of rectangular shape protecting a ceramic heat resistor affixed to 
contacts G and K, the whole stamped-assembled with the relay proper.

Questions:

-any idea where this guy can be obtained in either new or used condition ?

-anyone having a spare one of these ? (doubtful, I know...)

-a mechanic suggested that these can sometimes be opened and cleaned if the 
coils are still in good condition. Any ideas on how this should be done 
(just prying the thing open looks like a job in itself); the relay looks in 
perfect condition except for some verdigris (copper oxydation) on contacts B 
H and K, seemingly coming from the inside of the relay...

-has anyone just bypassed this one with some other alternative ?

Thanks in advance for your answers and a special thanks to the  nice people 
who answered my questions about firing the BA6 after 11 years of unuse and 
the quality of the heater boxes sold by Cal Imports and related issues.

Frank.
