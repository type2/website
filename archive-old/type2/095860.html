Subject: Booster/stiff pedal (was Re: vac booster check valve)

&gt;From: H Steven Dolan &lt;dworkin_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

&gt;If you can leg press 500
&gt;pounds, you can probably live without it, but if not, it can be important.

I've seen this comment several places and I just don't get it.  I've been driving my '71 Westy without the booster for several years and yes, it certainly doesn't feel 
like power brakes, but it's not a big deal.  FWIW, I'm not ripped and buff, and my right leg is only marginally larger than my left one. :-)

Seriously, have you guys experienced dead-booster buses as being hard to brake?

(My daughter does say the pedal is a tough one, and I'd sure love to have a working booster, but they ain't cheap....)

Joe
