Subject: compression low

Has anyone had any luck taking their bus to a priest for an exorcism?  I 
think mine has some evil spirits hanging around that just wont go away...

I'll try to make it quick: replaced both heads in July.  Bus has been 
running crappy or not at all ever since.  Fixed a whole host of problems, 
most recently trying to plug all vacuum leaks.  After the rebuild, the 
compression was about 130psi all the way around (after a bit of 
tinkering).  Now, ~250 miles later, the compression readings look like: 
65/80/50/75.  Yikes!  I forgot to try the &quot;squirt some oil in&quot; trick 
(though I'm not sure what it would mean if this affected anything).  The 
engine has been running hot if I take it on any trip over, say, 15-20 
miles (oil temp typ 230deg+).  Thus, all driving has been short trips of 5 
miles or so.

Have I totaled my engine?  Should I first try retorquing the heads?  Evil 
spirits?  

On a side note (following the spirits thought)... when I dug out my 
compression tester from the the footlocker underneath the back seat, I 
found a mysterious Clymer manual which covers '61-'79 buses.  Weird!  I've 
never seen this in my life before, and there it was sitting on top of my 
usual pile of tools and parts.  The bus is always locked (not that that 
means much) and nobody I know admits to sticking it in...  Just freaky.  
Maybe it holds the key...
