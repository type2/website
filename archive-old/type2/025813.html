Hey John,

I just finished rebuilding my PDSIT 3/4 dual carbs on my 1972 1700cc bus
engine and I have learned a few things about them that I will share with
you.

It has taken me about a year to feel comfortable with these carbs.

I will give you a synopsis.

I learned a lot reading the archive, Bentley, and doing this rebuild.

I am going to assume that you have the same carbs.

There are essentially 3 carbs here.  There are two main carbs, one for each
side, and a idle circuit that provides idle for both.

Chokes

The chokes are electrically activated.

They are heaters that turn on when the ignition is switched on that cause a
coil to unwind as it heats.  As it unwinds, it opens the choke flapper.
There is a choke on each side.  They need to be adjusted.  They are adjusted
with a cold engine.  There are three screws that hold the choke coil
apparatus in place.  Simply loosen them and turn clockwise looking to the
front of the bus until the choke flapper closes.  It is a good idea to
actuate the throttle mechanism a few times to make sure that you do not over
adjust this.

In John Muir's &quot;How to keep your VW alive&quot; book, he recommends turning these
all the way the other way so that the chokes are always open and do not
function.  I drive this way Spring to Fall myself with no problems.  I fear
that one of the choke wires may fall off (one has broken off on mine
actually) then I will be driving a perpetually choked engine.  A few other
design features of these carbs are noteworthy.  One is that there is a
throttle speed control mechanism associated with the chokes.  It opens that
main throttle a tad when the choke is closed (engine cold).  And there is a
vacuum actuated thingy that opens the choke flapper a tad when the vacuum
level is high.  

I somewhat agree with John Muir that chokes are stupid and that the thing to
do is disable them.  There is a lot of associated complication with them on
these carbs that can be a problem.  If the vacuum activated choke flapper
opener thing is leaking, you will get problems like backfiring that comes
from vacuum leaks.  Also, it is not good to run a perpetually choked engine,
which can happen if the chokes are not working.  It is nicer in the cold to
have the chokes but I like to run without them in the warmer weather.

Idle

There is a mixture and idle speed adjustment in the idle circuit.  They are
located on the drivers side carb toward the front of the bus.  There is an
approximately 1/2&quot; intake tube between the two adjustment screws.  The
smaller screw is an adjustment for the idle mixture.  The larger screw is
the idle speed adjustment.

On the mixture screw, going in (righty-tighty=in, lefty loosey=out) leans
the mixture, coming out richens the mixture.  The larger screw, in slower,
out faster.

I adjust my mixture to give the best idle quality which roughly correspond
to the fastest idle (too lean=slower idle, too rich=slower idle, just
right=fastest idle) and set idle speed using the idle speed adjustment.

this should be done with the engine warmed up.

Volume Control

I still remain somewhat in the dark about what this does.  There is a needle
valve that is screw adjusted on the throttle body of each carb called the
volume control.  I read somewhere that is is used to make the idle more
stable.  It seems to let a little bit of air in after the throttle flapper.
It seems to be something like a mixture adjustment.  There is a procedure
for adjusting them in the Bentley service book.  I follow it basically, but
really I just listen to the exhaust sound as I adjust it for the best most
consistent sound.  I have a dual exhaust EMPI muffler and I can distinguish
the sound from each side.  There does seem to be some coupling between the
two as well.  

Maybe someone on the list can illuminate us about the volume control, what
it does and how best to adjust.

Electrical valves

There are three fuel shut off valves in the system, one for the idle
circuit, one for each carb.

On my bus, the PO snipped off the idle shut off poppet and this valve is
non-functional.  I am pretty sure that the others are working.  I may
replace them with G55 jets at some point, just to simplify things.  Once or
twice, one of these have rattled loose and the result was a lot of
backfiring.

Balance Pipe.

When I got my bus, the rubber connectors on the balance pipe were totally
rotten.  The balance pipe is a large vaccum line that is something like 3/8&quot;
id that goes between the intakes on each side.  If there is a leak here,
there will be trouble.  Make sure they are in good shape.

Accelerator pumps.

Each carb has an accelerator pump.  This is a little mechanism that squirts
about 1cc/throttle actuation of liquid fuel into the carb to give good
throttle response.  These are rubber diaphragm actuated.  I have had a
diaphragm leak and one put in backwards and therefore did not pump (I got
good gas mileage, though, maybe I should turn them both around backwards).

On my bus, I have the dual vacuum connections to the distribution.  I think
it is a 005 type.  The vacuum connections come from the left side carb.

Make sure that your fuel lines are in good shape and are well clamped so
that you will not have a fire.

Carburation really is not much of a mystery to me any more.  The jetting
takes care of most everything.  The chokes are the most complex part.

My understanding of the way that this works is this:

There is a bowl filled with fuel.  It has a float in it that actuates a
valve, when the bowl empties, the float goes down and lets in more fuel and
it fills up again.

The gravitational force of the fuel in the bowl, the Bernoulli principle
applied to the flow of air through the venturi that creates a vacuum, and
the air pressure into the bowl, which is controlled by the air jet, and the
size of the main jet controls the flow of fuel into the venturi.  There is a
flapper that adjusts the flow of everything into the engine and therefore
the engine speed.  Hard to explain without pictures, maybe I should put one
on my website.  But if everything is working as designed, all will be well.
At least it has been for me.

After I took these carbs out, rebuilt them, reinstalled them, the engine
started after 30 seconds of cranking (needed to refill the bowls).  It ran
great immediately.  That scared me to death.  I did the adjustments on the
idle circuit and the volume controls and I was on my way.  My bus only has
70K miles and the bushing on the throttle body were still in great shape.

&gt; 
&gt; Howdy all!  Happy Good Friday, Passover, and all those other religious things
&gt; which I don't celebrate (no offense to religion, just stating that I'm a
&gt; &quot;heathen&quot;.)  Anyway, I got this new 73 Westy last night and I want to adjust
&gt; the idle.  I have never had a bus with dual carbs, they have all been single
&gt; carb or F.I., so How do I accomplish this task on my dual carb Westy?  Is
&gt; there an idle adjust screw on each carb?  Please advise.
&gt; 
&gt;
