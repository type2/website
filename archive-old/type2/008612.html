         Duncan,   I live here in Oregon, and I can attest to the fact
that you have to watch those who fill your tanks.  Arco is usually one of
the least expensive gas stops so I use them regularly but, they changed
over a year or two ago to those filler nozzles that keep the gas fume
danger down.  In so doing they created a major problem for bus owners. 
They either have to really jam that nozzle down in, or else hold it while
the tank gets filled.  When I fill at Arco (only if I have to), I always
go back and engage the attendant in conversation, all the while keeping
an eye on his procedures.  Usually I tell him I'd be glad to hold the
nozzle and they don't seem to mind.  This way I'm in control of the
spill/overflow.  Since I live here, I can be in more control of where I
get gas, but for those passing through that's not the case.  Best bet is
to tell the attendant the nozzle won't stay put in the gas filler tube. 
They'll probably agree from experience and let you pump your own gas.  I
do this, and it works for me 95% of the time.  Or, I'll just cruise
through a gas station and eyeball the pump and look for the lack of the
big rubber attachment to the nozzle, like the old days.  
          Even though it's nice to not have to get out in the rain and
bad weather (usual Oregon fare), I still prefer gas stops out of state
where I can take my time, clean the windshield, and pump the gas my way.
         Sorry you had to experience that......I know that gas station,
and they're notorious for trying to do everything too fast, and no doubt
the pump didn't turn off because the nozzle got stuck in the filler tube.
 The other thing these style nozzles are good at is when it clicks off,
it sometimes falls out, then drags down your paint spilling gas on the
way down.  Ask me how I know......
