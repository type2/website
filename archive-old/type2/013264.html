I took a look at an 81 Westfalia today that was advertized for $5000.00
US Dollars.
The lady on the phone raved about how nice the unit was. I was really
curious.
I'd be willing to pay five grand for a show quality westy so I couldn't
let this one pass.
Here is my report.
#1 cylinder 58PSI
#2 cylinder 40PSI
#3 cylinder 00000000 PSI
#4 cylinder 40PSI
FI Wireloom burned out, alternator wire loom burned out.
AC wired direct to the battery, wires fried, belts greasy and worn almost
completely through.
Sliding door handle missing, holdback broken.
Front seats covered with sheepskin covers, they needed to be hidden.
No spare tire, 1 bent wheel. No hubcaps.
Rear bumper missing. Southern Mexico trailer hitch installed, bent pretty
good crushing the rear body panel.
Aftermarket exhaust, no emissions, no catalytic converter, no crossover
pipe. No chance of getting an inspection sticker.
Both front turn/park lights taped up and holding water.
Engine covered in fresh blown out oil top and bottom.
Star Wars plumbing for LP Gas regulator.
Refigerator had been removed more than once, was loose in the Sink, Stove
console. Console showed pry bar marks on both sides.
Holes both sides of pop-up canvas, pinched too many times.
Pop-up gaskets and seals stuck on with blue silicone.
Wrong spark plug wires (resistance set)
New Battery!
Very clean engine oil, could hardly see it on the stick.
Oversize oil drain plug installed.
K-MART oil filter.
Both front vent windows missing latches.
Both gas cylinders on rear hatch dead.
Oil filler cap missing.
Rubber grommet on dip stick missing.
Radio antena broken off at base.
Sun Visors in neutral position straight down and floppy.
Rear view mirror hazed over and back side of plastic broken out.
She said &quot;It won't start right now, the alternator is out&quot;
Last registered 1998, same inspection date.
I properly insulted her by offering a salvage price and wrote up a list
of repairs very similar to this report.
I told her I would estimate that it would cost between $2 and $3 grand to
make this vehicle worth owning, and dependable with a state inspection.
