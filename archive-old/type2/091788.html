Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pressure regualtor?  huh?

profuel is the brand of aftermarket fuel pressure regulator often sold 
with the aftermarket electronic fuel pumps for carburators.  Sounds like 
the lines may have been running close to heat sources that rotted them 
out.  With the mechanical pump in place this highly suggests that it was 
added on.

&gt;&gt; 73 bus? carbs? does it have a mechanical or electric fuel pump.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Sorry, I always forget that info.  73 bus/72 stock dual carb engine.
&gt; Electric FP.   Mechanical in place but nothing hooked up.
