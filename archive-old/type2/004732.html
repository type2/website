Hey everyone-
My wife and I have been discussing making this trip but don't think it is going to work logistically- jobs, a house, dogs, etc. etc.... but we do think that we could swing about 2 months of it.  Just making it as far as possible.  We were wondering if anyone else might be in the same &quot;bus&quot; and would like to discuss it?  Either through the list or pmail?
Thanks-
Jeff, Kristi &amp; Sierra
