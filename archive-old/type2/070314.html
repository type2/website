Subject: Tips &amp; Tricks for Exhaust Gaskets, was Type-IV heads

On Wed, 14 Aug 1996, David Schwarze described his procedure as:

&gt; &lt;snip&gt; True, they can
&gt; be difficult to install, but I am usually able to do it on the first try by
&gt; smearing some anti-sieze (why anti-sieze?  because it's the right
&gt; consistancy) on the gasket and sticking it to the top of the exhaust pipe,
&gt; then gently raising up the heater box, keeping it level.  Never failed me
&gt; yet.

David has the advantage of me, in that my procedure involves a second
person, but what I do is to locate the ring in its recess in the head.  If
I am real lucky, it is already a friction fit.  If not, I have one hand
hold the ring in position in its recess(two fingers is all that fits),
second hand holds the punch, and the third hand (I *told* you there were
two people involved) hits the punch and peens the edge of the head to the
ring.

The real reason for this post is however to describe how to get
recalcitrant headers off the studs.  Assuming it doesn't just drop off
after you have removed the nuts from the studs (or the bolts from the
heads{don't ask}), if you take a coat hanger, wire it thru a brick and
around the manifold, you can use it as a sort of slide hammer to get the
bugger off, sliding the hanger forward and back to pull it down evenly.
