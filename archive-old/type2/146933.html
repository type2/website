Subject: Engine removal

Dear list,

After years of avoidance, my first engine pull is going to happen. It is 
a well covered topic, but I have what I think is a new question. Do I 
have to support the engine under the sump plate as all the books say, or 
can I put supports on  either side of it (they would press against the 
ribbed part of the crackcase)? To be more precise, I have cut a 
foundation block so that two foot long pieces of 2 inch square timber 
will  just slide in like railroad tracks about 8 inches apart from the 
back of the vehicle. They are a snug fit, so when I let a little air out 
of the tires and push the van forward (I have a removable rear valance), 
I am hoping to leave the engine behind on a nice stable table. The 
crankcase looks strong enough to me, but I don't want to do this, crack 
the case, and then have everyone saying I should have known better.

Forgot to say, it is a type I motor (it's a UK 1973 1600 DP).

Stephen W
