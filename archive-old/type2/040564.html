Subject: Repainting Floors with Rust Proof Paint

Hello Everyone--Well I am currently preparing my 71 Campmobile for a 
rustproof, soundproofing job, and yes all is going to remain stock. I am 
following the &quot;Heat, Rust, Noise&quot; bit I found in the archives...But I was 
thinking maybe I should throw down some fresh rustproof paint on the flooring 
before following the procedure? There is no rust to be found....but you can 
never be to safe. Any thoughts on some good rustproof paint I can use..Thanks 
for the help...Adam
