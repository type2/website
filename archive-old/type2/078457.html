Subject: Water help

Now I own a 59, a 76, and a 75, but a buddy begged me to put in a water motor 
for him, in his 87.   Heres the catch the motor is still carberated so I'd 
assume that it may have to come off an older body style because all the 
american models were fuel injected I've heard.  I had to switch the water 
pumps and all the plumbing.  Now the problem is none of the wiring was 
labled.   I know someone out there has a manual on the wasser motor and I 
need to know where all the wires run, if anyone can help I would appreciate 
it.

Increase the Peace
