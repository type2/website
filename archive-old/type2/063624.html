Subject: Re: hand cleaner

Here's another idea. Worked as well as pumice type this morning to get pa=
int overspray off my hands. Squirt of Dawn dishwashing liquid, a shake of=
 baking powder for abrasive action, a very little bit of water. Works gre=
at, it's cheap, and it's a lot milder that pumice type cleaners. For just=
 grease, we just use Dawn. Other dishwashing liquids don't cut grease and=
 oil as well. Besides, we got the idea from a show about how they rescue =
animals from oil slicks. The first thing they do is to wash the oil off o=
f the animals. You ask what they use? Dawn. Yep, they tried lots of other=
 cleansers, but Dawn got the oil off without harming the animal.
