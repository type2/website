Subject: best location for oil temp sender (it's not the usual question)

First, thanks for all the answers re &quot;dynamic weight.&quot; Please forgive me
for not replying to individual messages this one time.

Still studying the 911 engine, I find that the oil temp sender is located
at the end of the main oil galley, i.e, after the oil cooler and before the
oil reaches the bearings. Since the VDO aftermarket oil temp senders for
VWs (oil sump plate or dipstick type) measure oil in the sump *before* it
reaches the oil cooler, it is no surprise that the range of acceptable
temperatures reported on the Porsche and on the type2 lists are
considerably different. I don't have the data in front of me, but 30-40F
difference sounds about right. Measuring the temp after the cooler seems to
offer much more useful information.

Unfortunately, finding a good place for a sender after the cooler is not
easy on the veedub engines. One possibility would be to mimic the 911 setup
and place a sender at the end of the oil galley, which for the VW is behind
the flywheel. I'm not sure if there would be enough room between case and
flywheel, though. On a dual pressure relief case, there may be another
option: replace the plug of the relief valve #2 (the one closest to the
flywheel) with a reducing adapter, then screw the temp sender into the
adapter. Since the #2 relief valve gives at only 28 psi, it is likely to
see a permanent flow of oil.

Btw, with two temp senders, one at the usual place before the cooler, the
other one after, one could get a better idea of the cooler's condition.

Just some thoughts...

Sami
