Stated here:

When i first surfed the site, i thought i was encountering a hot-rod VW b=
eetle
type; '...we don't sell parts, work on or acknowledge the existence of th=
e
horrible, evil type4 engine...'
But when i found the page above i thought &quot;hey - this cat knows what he's=

talking about&quot; - not that i didn't think that before i hit the type4 page=
=2E..

If this quote is true: &quot;The stock cylinder heads on type 4 engines were
subject to slight design flaws and need some attention to have longer liv=
es.
We have found the tricks needed to help these heads live long powerful
lives.&quot;
You have (i'm sure you're aware) a solid market in this group.

I've got three type4 shortblocks saying &quot;..go ahead..build another one.. =
do it
right this time...&quot;
It will run the Raby heads, provided me budget will allow.

Care to provide a ballpark quote on a set of stock round-port 1800/2L hea=
ds?
I'm sure we'd all like to know - i do understand if you prefer not to
broadcast this info.
