Subject: Opinion on head work

As I have previously mentioned I have in the final stages of my engine
rebuild.  I am trying to get my CR's as close as possible.  To do this I
need to remove 2CC's from the head volume in two chambers.

So I took my extra 2L head ( thanks to the list member who generously
gave it to me last year , I have forgotten your name) and tried to
remove 2CC from it.  I have what I think is some success.

However, I'd like someone who is familiar with this type of work to have
a look.  I have a jpeg of the work and I'd like to send it to a
knowledgeable person and get an opinion.  Anyone out there fit the bill?

Thanks
Brent
