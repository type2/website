&gt;I thought that too when I first laid eyes on Bluto (my '73 hightop) but now
&gt;I am really glad I got it instead of a poptop.  It has more (badly needed)
&gt;storage than a pop top, you can ALWAYS stand up in it, setting up camp is
&gt;faster (and you can sleep in rest stops without it being obvious), and it's

        Just a few weeks ago whilst perusing the selection of junked busses
at Austin VeeDub, I noted the existence of just such a creature. Upon
closer inspection I too noted the large amount of extra cargo space-which
meant something to me after Inuvik-and the myriad other advantages of which
you speak. Bringing me to the big question: How is the top secured to the
vehicle? I noted that the VIN of the bus was 221*-meaning it was not a
kombi but rather a standard station wagon when it left the factory. This
gave me hope as I have a 220* and I have often wondered what kind of
underbelly support was created for the poptop kombi-therfore not being on
my bus, therefore making a westy conversion sehr schwer. If it is feasible
I am interested in the possiblility of taking this top off the junked bus
and putting it on mine. Any thoughts?

Peace,
