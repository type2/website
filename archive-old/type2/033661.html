Subject: Re: desperate! need oil filler tube

how about an oil filler tube for a 82 diesel vanagon.  do not know part # or 
have even seen one, but just met a guy today that had a bucket under his van. 
 of course i had to ask &quot;what gives&quot; he told me his oil fill tube broke and 
he can't find one.  he does not have a computer so i told him that i would 
check the type2 and vanagon lists for him.  he said he would try to get a 
part # tonight and call me.

thanks!
