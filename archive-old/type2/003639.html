Hello list,

In planning a summer road trip from Austin, TX to Tempe, AZ, I solicit
advice from the list.  I have a perfectly running recently rebuilt 1600
upright dual port with a new oil cooler, 34pict carb and 009 dist pushing a
79 Westy without a temperature gauge.  My concerns are with keeping it cool,
should I stick to 55mph or am I paranoid and should go 70mph?  Does anyone
having experience with driving I10 through NM and AZ have something that I
should know (like is it better to drive at night)?  Would it be necessary to
get a temperature gauge?  Is a rich mixture a good way to keep it cool?  Or
will it have no problems?  Thanks!

Christopher

P.S.  My engine compartment is correctly sealed and with all the tin.
