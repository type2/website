Subject: what I've have been up to

Hello just thought I would share with the list what I have
been doing the past 2 weeks.

It all started with a noise
I removed the engine... well about a month agao I belive,
trying to figure out what was causing a loud tap from
the right side of my engine(by cyl #1&amp;2). Before removing
the engine I first replaced the hydralic lifters on that side
hoping a colapsed one was making the noise. That didnt work and
i tryed a few other things to diganose the noise, no luck!
So since I had no idea what it could be I decide it was time
to take the engine out.

After about 5hours my friend learned the names of all the tools
we used and the engine was lying behind the bus ;) No I didnt make
him do the work, but had him handing me the tools.
So I was pretty amazed, I did it!!! I got the engine out
and it went farly well, also no one was crushed alive! hahaa
So I then began the tear down process, first I had to get
the tin off this beast. Well that took awhile, most of the nuts
were rusted on very well. I also found a few surprise's under
the tin, 2 spark plugs, what looked like some part of a screw
driver, and a rubber spark plug wire boot.  Also found that the
fins on the oil cooler were REALLY dirty, that couldnt have
helped cool the oil that great! Also looked like someone
spilled some oil in the fan housing, that made for lots of
sticky fun!(by the way those do it your self auto wash places
with the pressure washers works good to clean the tin :)

So I got the cylinder heads off and found the problem.
The valve seats on cylinder #1 were both pounded down very
bad. So I take it to the machine shop and have them install
2 new valve seats, exhaust valve's and do a valve job.
If I had to do it again I problay would have bought a new
cylinder head from AVP. They installs the valve seats good
so that doesnt happend again I belive. O well I'll see how
long this holds....(crossing my fingers here kinda)
Any one out there do this instead of buying new?

So right now I am cleaning my cylinders and pistons.
I hate cleaning but I know its worth it. The PO set the timing
way of and I am fighting a battle against carbon, by the way
I've won so far! So tommarow I am planning on putting the cylinders
and cyl heads back on. Maybe my package from busdepot well
show up in the afternoon.

Something I forgot to menchin that both engine mounts
the rubber ones on the rear cross support were split. I couldnt
tell when the engine was in but it was obvious when the engine was out, one 
side complety came off. Thought the engine was shaking a
lot, but never saw any obvious damage to the mounts.
Well was I wrong! O well I'll have new ones on the way.

I also went to get my alternator tested because it seemed
by battery wasnt charing well. Tried a few auto stores
before I found one that could test it, others didnt have the
adapter to test it right. Forgot which auto chain it was.
I saw him test it and he showed my what its output was, 11.5volts
I think. He told me its sopposed to be in the green area on the indicator 
which was 13-14 volts if I remember right. So how come
my alternator light never came on??? the bulb works, any ideas?

well thats the end of my bus tails, sorry you guys! I know
you where on the edge of your chairs. yea right!

Well thanks for reading it all the way through, the 5 of
you that read it, hopefully you enjoyed it :)
Alex Wisniewski,

if no thats what I am going to name him.
