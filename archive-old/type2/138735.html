Subject: 80-83 Vanagon site search

Hey folks,
I'm still trying to find a web site about air cooled Vanagons. I expect to
receive the motor for my 80 Westy in a couple of weeks and I have a few
questions particular to the early Vanagons. I thought I took good notes when I
pulled the engine about a year ago, but I always seem to miss something!

My bigest question is regarding the orientation of the accordion shaped tubes
that go between the heat exchangers and the tubes atached to the bus. Seems I
cant remember wich end of the tubes go toard the heat exchangers. I do recall
the longer tube being on the passengers side and that I couldn't seem to get
them out til I pulled the engine. I have tried to compare to my 75 bus but
they are quite different.

Thanks in advance for any help you may have,
Tom
