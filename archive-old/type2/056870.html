Subject: Parts Buses in San Diego

Went by Ecology Auto Wrecking in Oceanside last Friday afternoon and
found the following:

3 late bay window buses with sunroofs.  Two perfect bodies, one with
rusty roof. (Ecology won't sell whole car - they will crush these
babies).  One has motor still there.

1 early bay window(early 68) with motor(dual port) and tranny and nice
body.
