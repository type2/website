Hello:

This is my first message ever to the thousands out there (I've been lurking
and reading for a few weeks now).

I have purchased a 78 Westfalia which I'm getting up to snuff at the local
community college automotive program at which I teach.  

While surfing the web I came accross a Volksplane which I surfed further (I'm
a pilot).  I ran across  one in Canada which I bought.  I plan to get it up to
snuff also (flying) and paint it to match my Westfalia and then trailer it
around and brag and gab alot.

My questions:  Do folks get into this VW craziness in ways like this?  Are
there any other VW pilots out there?  I am sampling the VW Wesfalia, bus world.

What do you think?  Mail me directly if you are flying folks.  This is a test!!
