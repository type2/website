Roy -

Then we must agree to disagree on this point, at least on the dusty, grimy
or oily part.  Dirt, which is not translucent, will of course block the
optical infared (I may have gone out on a limb here in the &quot;dirt&quot; dept).
But with several grimy VWs and a very grimy 72 Toyota Pickup, all of which I
used the XR700 in the past 30+ years experienced no aberrations in on and
off-road use.  On the other hand, a sand rail I had a 79 Calif Hall unit
installed on a Type 4 1700 over 15 years ago gave me nothing problems, what
with dust and grime in the distributor (even with one of those aftermarket
&quot;dust boots&quot; attached).  I switched it to a Federal 093 distributor,
installed an XR700 and had no running problems afterward.

But then again, it may have been just pure, dumb luck ;-)

&gt;  Ah, beg to differ here, but I think you have it backwards
&gt; here. Optically-triggered systems are fine unless the light source gets
&gt; dusty, dirty, oily or grimy - then the beam of light is affected negatively.
&gt; Hall-effect magnetic systems, on the other hand, are not affected by dust,
&gt; dirt, oil, grime and moisture.

&gt;
&gt; Ah, but it is NOT a &quot;Hall&quot; Ignition System.  Allison/Crane XR700 units
&gt; have been an infared-opto-trigger beam style for the past 30+ years.  The
&gt; beam is broken by the slots in the rotor disc installed on the distributor
&gt; shaft just below the ignition rotor.  The nice thing about the opto-trigger
&gt; beam is that dust/dirt does not usually affect it, unlike cheeper Hall
&gt; &quot;magnetic&quot; style ignitions.
&gt;
&gt; But it is still classified as an Electronic Ignition System.

&gt; &gt; Roy, I use the Crane 700 system and it has a large electronic box with a
&gt; &gt; heatsink on it. What kind of ignition is this classified as?? Seems like
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; lot of electronics for a Halls system?? Why bother with it rather than
&gt; &gt; just
&gt; &gt; use your 39 dollar system??
