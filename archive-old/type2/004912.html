I know this is not the end of the question, but the old Bus Boys catalog I
have says that the 021-903-655D is for the ALX75X alternator (35 amp).  They
show 022-903-655U as the number for the AL108X alternator (75 amp).

Even in this old catalog, they note that they only have the 022-903-655U in
a Used version (no new!).  They also don't list the pulley for the AL108X,
though you can get the alternator itself.  I really wanted to do this
conversion, too...

&gt; &gt; If this is the part number I think it is, I don't believe it is
&gt; &gt; discontinued. ...  Check with your dealer, for part # 021 903 655D
&gt; &gt; and if that's indeed the one you need, he should be able to get it for
you
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; about $16.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; List and Ron,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I just called my friendly local VW parts man and, sure enough, there
were
&gt; &gt; 10 of the #021 903 655D alternator cooling boots located in the
California
&gt; &gt; parts warehouse.  I ordered one and wanted to tell others that there are
&gt; &gt; actually some out there--$16.00 just like Ron said! Go get 'em...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; But did you also confirm the part number/application?  While I had been
told
&gt; by one customer that this was a 70 amp alternator boot, the original
poster
&gt; says that it may in fact be a 55 amp alternator boot (hence my suggestion
&gt; that you check with the dealer).
