Subject: '77 T2 Automatic Trans several questions.

Dear Type2 List:

I expect to post several questions over then coming weeks about my new
van.  This is number 1.

I got an essentially stock '77 camper van (not a westy, maybe an
Adventurewagen, has the Safare like always poped top (hightop?), see
http://www.eskimo_dot_com/~des/vw/daboat/snow.jpg for an outside view) for
$170 with a almost dead engine (0 compression in #3, more on that later).
The bus has an automatic transmission, which seems to work fine (shifts up
quickly and smoothly, could not tell if it kicked down correctly due to
poor state of the engine).  How should I regard the '77 automatic
transmission (I have every reason to believe that it is the original
engine and transmission)?

1) Do they have a generally good reputation?

2) How much do rebuilt ones cost relative to rebuilt manual transmissions?

3) Is there any routine maintenance aside from new ATF to perform?

4) Is a conversion to manual transmission simple or complex (assume I pull
a manual transmission, shift lever and clutch from a junk yard)?  Would
the computer also have to be changed?  Is that a smog legal thing to do in
California?

5) It may be leaking ATF, I think via the pan at the bottom of the
transmission, can I just unbolt that pan and change its gasket, or will
this get me into trouble?
