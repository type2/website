Subject: [T2] cold start trouble addendum
Date: Mon, 19 Mar 2001 09:48:34 -0600

I always forget to add something:  I unplugged the cold start valve to
eliminate those problems, it's not cold enough here to need it, it's
actually quite warm.  And the thing does the same thing after I let it sit
for a day - it'll only crank and won't start unless I get it going with the
cyl temp sensor disconnected then connect it back up.

Thanks!

&gt; Well, not really cold - I'm in Texas!  Background: my 77 FI van runs
great.
&gt; I installed a hot start relay and was testing it, starting up (good),
&gt; shutting down, starting up (good), shutting down, starting up - and it
just
&gt; cranked and cranked.  I went back and checked for a popped off hose -
none.
&gt; After a while I tried disconnected the cyl temp sensor and it started
right
&gt; up albeit smokey, so I hooked the sensor back up and it roars to life.
Runs
&gt; great, shut it down, starts right up.  Then I shut it down and let the
&gt; engine cool and it just cranks and cranks - same sinario.  I checked the
&gt; resistance of my cyl temp sensor (it's fairly new) - 4k ohms at probably
&gt; 60F.  What could be going on?  Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!!
