&gt;  I have been working on T1 engines for a while now. I just got my first
&gt;  bus with a pancake engine in it, a 72 Deluxe with a 1700 dual carb. How
&gt; in the hell do you get to the spark plugs without taking off tin? While
&gt; checking compression I dropped both rear most plugs (#2 &amp; #4) and can't
&gt; friggin get to them, they are inside the tin!

sounds about normal, to change em I use the spark plug socket that hads
some foam in it to hold the plug...and some extenders.   
 finding plugs in the tin is all too common one or two probably won't
cause problems but I fish em out with a probe that has a powerfull magnet
on the end, couple bucks at your FLAPS
