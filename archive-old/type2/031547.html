&gt; I think it's a bad plan to make any changes immediately before leaving on a

I have to agree, and I have run 100% synthetic since 1976 but the
principal of making a change before a major trip is a &quot;Sin&quot; we have
probably all have committed but it is still a bad idea

&gt; I'd personally NOT go with synthetic unless you're running extremely high oil
&gt; temperatures.
&gt; What I would do is use straight weight 40 in a good brand. Think about it, on a
&gt; cross country trip, you might put on 400-600 miles without cooling down.

well the great advantage of the synthetic is the high temp stability, it
will stay &quot;50&quot; no matter how hot (within reason) the engine gets for how
long.
