Subject: Re: Rear Engine T1--&gt;T2 Mount Adapter

&gt; The factory versions are rubber mounted I believe between the engine and
&gt; the steel bar. I know this is true with the T-IV engines, dunno for sure
&gt; about the T-I engines.

Also true for the T1 engine.

I'm almost positive that I've seen one vendor specify that these adapters
are recommended for *temporary* use only -- e.g. to shoehorn something
random into your Bus for a few weeks while you rebuild its &quot;real&quot; engine.
