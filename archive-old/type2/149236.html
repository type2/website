Subject: What's different baout a 1980 air cooled from a 76?

Someone off a different list (local camping group) has offered me a 1980
body when he heard what terrible shape my bus is in (mine is rusted through
on just about every panel). Now I'm wondering if my engine/tranny is
swappable into a 1980. Mines a 76 2.0L FI. His is a 1980 aircooled (that's
all I know of it) that he was going to part out. I found a couple pics
online, and they LOOK alike.
 Can anyone either tell me what the differences are, or point me to a
site/resource that can?
 Thanks
Chris
