Subject: [T2] Does clutch assembly change during 1971?

This has bitten me on the butt a couple of times with my 71 Westy.  The 
71 Clipper I had years ago (#2212044508) had the pressure plate with no 
center ring, flat ears on the TO bearing, and a sleeve over the mainshaft.

But my current 71 Westy has center ring on the plate, round ears on the 
TOB, and no sleeve.  VIN 2312222811, which is later than the above.

So either I have an earlier tranny, or something else?  Anyone know 
anything else about mid-year or model-based variations in clutch design 
around 71?
