Subject: Re: [T2] Painting muffler

 I bought the POR brand silver exhaust paint for 70 Westy and had similar 
results, despite a thorough cleaning with the stuff in the kit. It looked OK 
for maybe a week, then the blistering around the top exhaust flanges started 
. The muffler retained it's coating for a few months before the rust 
started....Next time, I guess  I'll have to  breakdown and get the ceramic 
coating : (   Scott, it may be worthwhile to mention that since your Bultaco 
is a 2 stroke, it's exhaust is much cooler than any VW engine so the paint 
you used will have a better chance of survival. The exhaust on my dirt bikes 
has always been easier to keep paint on than any automotive header system 
I've had.
