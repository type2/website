It's possible, but unlikely.  Now if the battery was flooding to
overflowing and diluting the electrolyte it would certainly harm the
battery, but this doesn't seem to be the case here.  Since rainwater is
distilled, it is just the thing for filling batteries!

It is likely that the battery has one or more weak cells, which would
explain the varience in fill.
