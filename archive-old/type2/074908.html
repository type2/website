There is only one good thing about your situation.
If you keep your rear window clean you'll see the oil loss there before
it shows up on your gauges or idiot light.
I believe that you could make a yoke/crossbar that spanned the strainer
opening inside and add a small amount of insurance but I don't see a fix
with splitting the case.

&gt; went out this morning to do a regular oil/filter change.  pulled the 
&gt; nut
&gt; off the strainer and drained the oil. looked ok, looked at strainer 
&gt; and
&gt; there were two good sized hunks  of metal, knew instantly what they 
&gt; were..
&gt;   they were curved and sort of triangular.  and had threads on the 
&gt; inside,
&gt; it was part of the boss that holds the oil strainer stud.....this is 
&gt; not a
&gt; fresh break, happened sometime in last 4 months since last oil 
&gt; change,
&gt; don't remember anything happening when I put the stainer back on 
&gt; then.
&gt; 
&gt;   checked it and sure enough the strainer will wiggle slightly...put 
&gt; it
&gt; back together and it torqued down nicely to spec.  refilled and run 
&gt; the
&gt; engine.  everything is normal, put cardboard under engine,  nadda 
&gt; not one
&gt; drop of oil in over an hour.
&gt; 
&gt;    I guess I know the answer but I have to ask...is there any way at 
&gt; all
&gt; to fix this without spliting the case????  this is a DAMN GEX case, 
&gt; last
&gt; remanant of the disaster I had with them years ago.....they are a 
&gt; curse.
&gt; 
&gt;   this is my 1.5 year old two liter rebuild, it is finally running 
&gt; really
&gt; sweet after lots of tweaking it up....got gauges and presure is up.  
&gt; guess
&gt; until ???   I am driving a time bomb, have AAA gold and guess I will 
&gt; get a
&gt; buzzer on my low oil presure switch to warn me when it 
&gt; fails.  10min/10days/10months/10years?????
