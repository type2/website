&lt;&lt; I have used the aftermarket part that is sold as a repair for broken
 accelerator cable ends.  It has a small set screw on one end that locks
 down on a cable and the opposite end is slender and solid...the slender
 end then slips into the barrel nut on the heater box and can be clamped
 down.  
 The only time this isn't usefull is when the heater cable is broken off at
 the point where it leaves the tube the heater cable exits.

Slightly different but still cable ends.  When I bought my bus the PO had put 
on a cable rather than wire clutch &quot;cable&quot;.  He had looped it through the 
hole in the clamp and then used a cable bracket, the kind you buy comerically 
in hardware stores, to fasten the cable onto itself.  The end going through 
the clamp was a loop.  It worked well, but I took it off and put on a stock 
type cable so I would know what I was working with but it is a thought if you 
aren't worried about looking original.
