Subject: Re: [T2] type2 mailing list source of spam?

 A pox on them and on those
&gt;&gt; stupid enough to respond to them.

And there is the crutch. Spam only exists because it pays, and pays well.
Which means there are a lot of _______ out there who respond to spam,
fueling the market. Maybe a new approach is required - make it illegal to
respond to internet solicitation. If the spam is illegal so should the
&quot;consumption&quot; of it. Isn't that the norm that both the producer and consumer
of illegal activity are held to task, because it effects far more people
than just themselves?
