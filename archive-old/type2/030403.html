I forgot in the last post to mention a couple things...

Given the level of frustration I was feeling, at one point, I decided that
I had better check to make sure I had not spent a week chasing down an
empty gas tank (sure the guage shows 1/4 tank, but it *is* a VW fuel guage
:-)  As a result, I went down and bought an FI fuel pressure guage.  Now,
when I got home and tried to hook it up, I discovered that the test guage
was set up for a schraeder valve (the standard US tire valve) or for a
special fitting on GM engines and that the pressure tap (located between
the #2 and #3 injector ports on the fuel ring) on my bus has a 7mm bolt
and no schraeder valve or way to hook the guage to the port.  At this
point I was frusterated enough to weld the damned things together but,
fortunately, I don't own a welding torch (not to mention the wisdom of
welding two gasoline filled lines :-)  Instead, I went back to the store
and bought a valve stem extender, used a foot of my stash of FI fuel hose
and a couple clamps and made an adapter.  The standard valve stem adapter
is a snug fit in the regular 8mm FI hose.  Also, because (if everything is
working) you will be getting at least 35psi of gasoline, you wanna clamp
the hose tight at both the test tap and at the valve extension.

Second, JC Whitney advertises an exhaust gas analyzer (EGA) in their most
recent catalog for ~$130US or $199 with a dwell/tach and voltmeter built
in. Because my dwell meter recently died, I decided on the full kit model.
The unit is made by Gunson in Britain and is much higher in quality than
the usual run of Whitney stuff (metal case, not plastic, etc.)  Anyone
have a general opinion of the quality to be expected from Gunson?  They
are new to me, but might be rather better known across the pond :-)

While I have not yet used the EGA feature, I did check the dwell using it
and it agrees with what I think it ought to be at.  (BTW, if you are
without a dwell meter, the any analog voltmeter (or digital if the refresh
rate is low) can be used to check dwell.  The formula is:

50 (the dwell you want)     x (the unknown voltage)
------------------------  = -----------------------------
90 (for a 4 cyl engine)     12 (the volts at the dist)  

or x = 6.66 volts.  Because the actual voltage at the dist is a bit
higher, I tend to aim for a reading closer to 7 to 7.5 volts.  But in an
emergency, anything from 6-8 will get you home.  Just in case.

and there was a third thing....  but I forget :-( oh, well, maybe later...
Going out to look for those %^(*&amp;^ ground wires. (and thanks again Steve)
