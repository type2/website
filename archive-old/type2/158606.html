Subject: fuel injection systems

      i have a 1978 vw transporter.  i know that it is fuel injected.  i
need to know what type of fuel injection system that i likely have in this
bus.  this will be my first attempt  at a fuel injected rig.  any advice you
can give me will be much appreciated.   the engine is the 2.0 liter or
2000cc which ever you prefer.  also my battery tray is rusted completely
though.  there is no tray there at all actually.  should i try and use the
other side of the bus where the second battery would have gone or should i
put it somewhere else.
       i just changed the fuel filter and when i removed the filter, fuel
only flowed from the engine side of the filter.   the filter was very, very
clogged.  should i assume that the fuel line from the tank is the same.
should i just replace the line or try and clean the tank then replace, or
clean the line.
       i live in northeast georgia ( athens) and if anyone is in the  area
and would like to help me get this old girl up and running, drop me a line
and we can make it happen.
