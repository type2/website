Hi,

a question for those in the know:

I'm in the process of installing an 911 engine into my '75 bus and
already cut the hole in the battery tray to fit the auxiliary oil
tank. I also had to cut some of the sheet metal where the ECU used to
be, so that the fuel filler neck is now visible from the engine
compartment. 

How important is it that I fabricate new sheet metal to completely
separate the engine compartment from the fuel filler neck/gas tank
area?

Thanks in advance :-)

Sami
