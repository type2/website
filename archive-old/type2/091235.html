Subject: Re: [T2] engine case crack?

Giles,

As Jim said, the best check for a crack in a T4 case is look for the rod.
Short of that, I have not seen a cracked case either.  Jim's suggestions
to check the drain and screen (and the cover for the temp sender) are good
ones.  OTOH, your leak might still be pushrod tubes or seals (rear, front,
or oil cooler).

*IF* the bus is level *AND* the oil is below full *THEN* the oil level in
the sump is below the inboard ends of the tubes.  If the bus is tilted at
all, tho, that is not the case.  And even if it is level, there is a
substantial amount of oil in the lifters on hydraulic lifter models or in
the oil passages on all models.  Also, the pushrod tube is *THE* low point
in the head.  If you have a leak on the outboard end of the tube, there
will be plenty of oil in the heads to leak out and make a puddle.

On the seals, they won't leak when the bus is off and level, but they may
have pumped out enough that the bus will drip for a week afterward.
Certainly the bell housing and fan shroud can hold a *lot* of oil.  They
are supposed to have drain holes, but those holes can clog (AMHIK :) and
slow the draining 'til it looks like a leak.

The first question is &quot;How big a puddle?&quot;  If you see a cup or less, it
could be pushrods, rear main, front main, cooler, or drains.  If it is
more like a quart and the bus is level both front-to-back and
side-to-side, then it is drains or screens. It is possible you may be the
first case of cracked block... not that it *can't* happen, just that it is
unlikely... check everything else first.

The second question is &quot;Where?&quot; clean the bottom of the case and the
pushrod tubes at a carwash that has a steam cleaner wand.  Drive it home,
put a couple sheets of newspaper under it weighted by bricks and wait for
the drips to appear.  Try to track them back to their source.
