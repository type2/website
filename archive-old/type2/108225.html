The more accurate way to test for a drain is to set your test meter to DC milliamps.
Connect it between the negative terminal and the negative post. Anything more than 100 ma will slowly drain
the battery. A dome light on is about 300 ma.....

A digital clock will show a 12v drain but only about 5 ma. That will take about a 3 months to make a fully
charged go completely flat.
