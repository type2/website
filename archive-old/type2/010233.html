SORRY! After spending the last year in Northern
Arizona, I can honestly say that I saw more severe
winter driving here than when I lived in Portland,
Or.!! For instance: the morning I woke up to 9&quot; of
snow on and around my bus, or &quot;monsoon season&quot; (yeah,
I laughed too, until I live through 2 of them) where
it RAINS *several* inches a day, often 4-5 times a
week from July to mid-September, often resulting in
flash-floods( some of them in town). I have photos of
all of this and will put them on my site soon.

Also, they don't &quot;sand&quot; the roads here....they
&quot;gravel&quot; them....it's Hell on a paint-job.

I *will* say that I see a *lot* more classic cars here
than anywhere else I've lived, but only in the summer;
in the winter, people pretty much drive their beaters,
I guess.
