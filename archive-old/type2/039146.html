Subject: Sliding door

Hello VW-ers,
	Well, the engine, electrical and bad CV boot (joint ok) have all been
brought back up to spec and are working very well.  Now the fun part starts.
That being the body work and pop-top change out.  I have some wierd after
market pop-top, that goes straight up like a Rivera, but doesn't have the
same hardware or anything.  Blech, I hate it. So, I am replacing it with a
beautiful Westy pop-top that I grabbed of a junk yard Westy.  That should be
fun.  I',m going to need a job, though, if I'm going to replace the canvas.
Sheesh how expensive this stuff is!
	Ok, like I said, I am going to start working on the body.  The more I get
into this, the more panels I find I'm going to need.  Pretty much the entire
bottom edge of this thing is rusted and needs to be replaced.  The most
tragic thing about it, though, is one day, while working on the bus, I
opened the sliding door, only to have the lower track collapse on me!  From
the rear of the track forward about six inches, it has just crumbled.
Looking closer, I find that it is mainly constructed of Bondo and
Bondo-cloth (I forget what it's called).
	I think i know what I am going to do, but I am looking for advice as to
what I should do to repair that.  The rocker panels are easy to get, but I
have been unable to find a door track anywhere.  I think I'm, just going to
have to find a good bus in a recycler and torch cut the track and weld it
into mine.  Any other suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
