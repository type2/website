&gt;    My old '71 used a homemade air recycler (cabin air was sent thru' the heat
&gt; exchangers over and over) it got hot in there...
&gt; I'm up for a system that could be used on later engines... ?-)

this all should be in the archives but.
  I have a recycle system on a BA-4 in my 78 bus.  the stock heating
system has been completely removed and I have installed.

.  air intake is under the dash.
.  VW Air Conditioner blower motor is used to cycle the air
.  two ducts from blower to under the bus
.  BA-4 is mounted transversely under the front on the old A/C evaporator
mount (or is that condenser, never could keep which is which straight)
.  the hot air from the BA-4 is ducted into the stock heat duct just
behind the front beam.
.  sperate controls are mounted on a panel filling the ash tray opening in
the dash.

still phutzing with getting the thermostat working to cycle it off and on.
I don't usually turn it on unless I really need it so it generally runs
constantly or pretty much so.
