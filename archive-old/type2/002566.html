Steel Wool and a little acetone.  I had tinting on my Bus, and it worked
wonders.  Had tinting on another car, and I called a tinting place to ask
how to remove it.  This was their suggestion.

&gt;Does anyone know what will get the glue off my front windows after I peeled
&gt;the purple tint off?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

&gt;
&gt;ps:  I left the tint on in the back..
