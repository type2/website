Subject: Re: [T2] Burning a quart of oil a day...

&gt; My bus burns a quart of oil every day.  I don't really want to rebuild the
&gt; engine but I know I need to.  Everyone tells me that rebuilding an engine is
&gt; really hard, and a lot of work.  Would it be more reasonable to put a new
&gt; engine in, that is newer and more powerful engine in or rebuild mine?

If it is really burning a quart iy must be so smokey as to be undriveable.
That would probably mean no rings or a hole in a piston or something
drastic and yes, a serious rebuild.
Is it possible that it is just leaking a quart a day?
If so you might want to clean it real good and look for the area of
leakage and go from there.
If its an older engine and very leaky you might want to give it a
dissassemble and refresh with new seals (kit is only like 10.00 + a few
for crank seal)  and check tolerances and torques while youve got it out
to help evaluate its condition..
