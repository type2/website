Subject: Seals, as on Bumper Splash Pans
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com

Listerinos,

Just a couple of days ago I asked the list about the possible whereabouts of 
bumper splash pan seals for 68-72 Busses.  No definite answers.  One 
respondent thought he might have purchased them from WCM or WW.  Another gave 
me a step-by-step for making my own.  And I received requests from others 
asking me to pass on any information I might find about these seals.
Well, I found them!  If you are looking for them call BFY at 714.639.4411 
(tech assistance) or 800.789.0900 (order desk).  Their parts number 
designation is 211 707 397C.  Cost is $8.00 for the pair.
I hope that helps somebody out there with their restoration.

Mike
