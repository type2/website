Subject: Coming to America

Hope this is okay as a Friday topic.
My wife and I live in England but keep our '82 Westy in Texas and spend a 
couple of months camping around North America almost every year. This year 
we're going up to Alaska and back, via New Mexico, Utah, N. Nevada, Oregon, 
Washington, back through California and Arizona. (Probably.) Avoiding 
Interstates.

Leaving 21 August and returning late October.

We'd be grateful to know about any VW-ish gatherings, formal or informal, 
which will be happening during this time along our route. Or anyone into 
socializing with passing wayfarers -- we're moderately interesting people to 
go out for a beer with, being an atheist+Christian, ex-Marxist + lifelong 
Conservative voter, sciencey book reader + artistic ex-farmers' wife, Texan 
+ Brit. (Reciprocal hospitality offered to List members visiting Britain.)

Thanks.

Doug Hainline
