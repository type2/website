&gt; 2 slip in Heater box repair tubes???  I've never heard about them. Do you
&gt; mean they are specifically used to fix up the rusty ends of stock heater
&gt; boxes at the muffler connection? If so, where can I get them? 
Yes, that is their intended use.

The intended use is as follows: 
measure the wide part of the slip in repair tube, and cut your heaterbox
off so that when this is slipped in it will have the same overall tube
length.

Slip in the repair section.

Weld it in place, and you are done...

I bought them at my VWFLAPS here in town, any VW shop should be able to
get them. Like $1 or $2 a piece if i remeber right.

take care,

Steve
