Subject: Re: [T2] Oil breather difference

Hi Eric,

The FI model just has to allow less air to pass because that is
additional air not measured by the AFM. If you have a lot of blow by,
that is not sufficient crankcase pressure relief. The older breather
was full open, using only baffles to prevent unnecessary oil passage
out of the crankcase. Even this can be too constrictive with excessive
blowby because the nipple at the carb is too small, hence the
recommendation by some to just disconnect the hose from the carb and
let it hang somewhere as in Chris' case.

John

 I have a fuel inj oil breather hooked to my weber prog - should I be looking
 for an earlier version - what is the difference ? Wondering after reading all
 the posts about oil coming out of the dip stick tube
