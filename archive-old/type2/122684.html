Subject: Re: [T2] help with fasteners, installing westy back seat

On Sun, 23 Nov 2003 14:05:49 -0700 
Tom was heard babbling something about [T2] help with fasteners, installing westy back seat:

&gt; Tried to tighten them. Turns out the hole is slightly too big! *&amp;%#$%&amp;! 
&gt; The threadsert does not fall through the hole, The lip is large enough 
&gt; to keep it in the hole but immediately underneath the lip is a knurled 
&gt; area that is supposed to bite into the sides of the hole to prevent the 
&gt; device from turning while you tighten it. It cant bite into the metal. I 
&gt; think small problem, I'll open the lid to get into the gas tank 
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone out there have any ideas to resolve my predicament? 
&gt; 
&gt; Frustratedly yours,
&gt; Tom

J-B Weld.

Mix it thick like putty. Plug the holes you drilled with it. Re-drill
tomorrow (remember, smaller drill bit). Use your inserts.
