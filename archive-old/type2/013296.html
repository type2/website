&gt;i have heard 2 different ways to rig the oil temp sender:
&gt;
&gt;1) drill a new hole through the block

Missy:

VDO makes an oil temp sender that takes the place of the plug for the oil-pressure relief valve that fits on the underside of the case near the pulley, on a type 1 motor.  This is a good location because it senses the temp of the oil that's headed to the main bearings.  I don't know if this is the same as a type4 motor.  If you're interested, I can look up the VDO part number tonight when I go home.  Also, VDO makes an oil pressure sender that fits where the stock VW pressure sender goes (again, on a type 1), that has 2 terminals on it.  One is for the pressure guage, and the other is for connecting to the stock idiot light.  I can get you that part number also.
