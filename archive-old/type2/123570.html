Subject: tranny part source

i am going to install a donor 091(76-79) in place of my 5 rib 002 (75).
before i do i'd like to peek inside the nose cone. does anyone know of a
source for nose cone gaskets only? last time my flaps kindly separated one
out of a kit, but that can't become a pattern.    - steve
