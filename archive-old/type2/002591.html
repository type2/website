IMHO, the transmission is the same, all you need is all tin to match the
upright engine. If you are going to re-build, I would go for a 1641 kit. Not
much more heat, lots more torque. If you use a flow exhaust &amp; manifold (e.g.
the 'extractor' manifold with a quiet-pack exhaust) you will get even more
torque &amp; power. You can burn valves etc quite easily though with these
engines. The above set-up means you don't thrash the engine as you have a
better power band &amp; heaps of torque.

However you _MUST_ re-jet to match the charitaristics of the modifications,
other-wise you will 'lean-out' the mix &amp; burn away the heads where the plug
enters the chamber. With the correct timing &amp; mixture this set-up pulls well
&amp; is as cool as stock (+/- 10deg). In fact cooler up hills!

&gt;this is EXACTLY  what i am looking for.!!!  somehow i need to find out what
is
&gt;needed to fit a beetle engine in my van, so i end up with a factory ( at
least
&gt;in your case) looking, operating vehicle.  the type iv motors are about 3
&gt;times as expensive to rebuild as a normal beetle motor.  if you have any
info
&gt;for me or where i can find info to do this please let me know ....i am
going
&gt;to post a note to the site.
