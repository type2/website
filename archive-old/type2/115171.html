&gt;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - sometimes -  but some &quot;eyes&quot; have 
&gt;really bad taste.

My reaction when I first saw the new Microbus was laughter.   Saying that 
its ugly might be an understatement.....................However......I've 
heard much worse statements made regarding baywindows busses, so its almost 
like throwing rocks in a glass house.   The same can be said about the &quot;New 
Beetles&quot; vs the real bugs.  Will I be first in line to buy 
one?........No.......Would I drive one?.......probably........

Actually my number one complaint is the TV screens mounted in the back of 
the seats.....but the TV debate is for another time and different forum....
