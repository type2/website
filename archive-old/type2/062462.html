Subject: re:78 FI cold start/idle 

&gt;Does this problem sound familiar to anyone: When I start my 78 FI bus,
&gt;it runs at higher RPM just for a few seconds, then starts to settle
&gt;down to idle (normal so far).  However, the RPMs just keep dropping
&gt;until the bus almost stalls.  It will usually catch &quot;just before the
&gt;last revolution&quot; and come back up to a normal idle, but sometimes it
&gt;does stall

Rodney: Sounds like a vacuum leak. Look for a hose off, or broken. 
       I had this, when the hose came of the Decel Valve, but because it 
      was a large hose, the engine was too lean to keep running. Yours is
     probable a smaller leak. 
    What I think is happening: Van starts with Cold Start valve adding extra
   fuel to go with the extra air caused by the leak. Van starts, and runs fast 
  with extra air, and gas. When cold start valve shuts down, now extra air
 makes idle mixture too lean causing it to almost stall. Any throttle 
adds enough air to swamp the air leak effect. However, you amy be runnig a bit
lean all the time.
