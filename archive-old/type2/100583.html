Subject: parting out 79ASI and 72 Westy

  The 79 is pretty well stripped now but the 72 just arrived and will be
parted and junked this week along with whats left of the 79.
  The 72 is complete minus steering column, clomplete westy interior in fair
condition even the sink cabinet. 2 crank out windows, etc. Sliding door
stuff all broken.

  If you need something including any sheet metal contact me
