Subject: Air Cooled parts- Last chance

I'm making a 320 mile trip this Saturday to scavenge 82 Air Cooled
Vanagon parts.
If you're need anything for 80-83 aircooled let me know.
The parts that are already spoken for are:
Tranny, Heater Boxes, Crossover pipe, rear bumper, engine, FI system.
Everything else is there and If I don't have to hold, clean it these
parts will be cheap.
Whatever I don't get: the owner is going to put on E-bay Sunday night.
Speak up now!
I'm not going to chase after parts a second time on this Vanagon.
