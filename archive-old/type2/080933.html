Subject: 2L Engine help please

------=_NextPart_000_000F_01C1DB47.2D48EF00
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Can anyone out there help me on the following:-

The 2L engine in my bus started &quot;ticking&quot; at high revs and eventually =
overheated. I've now taken off the cylinder head to reveal a mark in the =
piston crown caused by the exhaust valve!


I've noticed that there are no gaskets between the crankase and cylinder =
barrel and between the barrel and the cylinder head.
Should there be? If so I presume this is why the valve had been hitting =
the piston crown. - or could it be a weak valve spring as well?


I bought the engine after it had a dropped valve repaired.

Also I think it may have overheated because the flaps weren't working =
properly - would I be better off removing them as I wouldn't be putting =
many miles on the engine in the future?

thanks for any help, Dave, South Wales
