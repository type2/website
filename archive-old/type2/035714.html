i happen to have a cooler rack that has an open spot so you can put in a 
quart of milk, or other tall container.
seem to remember it not fitting into my cooler [found it whilst searching
for westy parts at a wrecker].
it's not near me [another state in storage] at present, however 
soon will be.
if this is an item of interest for anyone, please let me know.
i'm way strapped for $$ so i couldn't pay to ship it across town, but
it's useless to me.

on a side note...
a runon: i'm getting ready to swap suspensions from my '71 to
my '68. besides noticing the lug patterns are different,  while pulling 
the motor, found some kind of doohicky mounted on the left side of hte 
compartment. this was connected to the front of the carb by a vaccume
hose. my guess is vaccume assisted brakes [i hrd 'bout those my 
last '71 dint hvm].
also some other kind of big hose connecting to the bottom left of teh 
carb. this is the size of the charcoal cannister hose and has some kind of
one way air flow nugget in it. for sure vac ass. brakes i bet.

ok... so i gues the real question is... is this swap going to be complete
hell or impossible? i was beginning to think since i was keeping 
the wheels in tact, disconnecting the suspension from the frame
and swapping straight over that it be pretty straight forward.

oh well, comments, suggestions, criticisms and flames alike appreciated.

presently pulling the tranny int eh '71 to replace the t/o bearing and
go into the '68. also those knee level heat openings in the '71 are
going to be pumping heat out to me soon [why not just put them in the
first place, they piped heat there...].
