Jeff,
I'd measure or have measured the crank (and check the integrity of the crank keyway) and the diameter of the main bearing bores, so your positive you buy the correct main bearings, since it's been rebuilt once already, don't assume standard sizes. I'd pick up some brand new dowel pins and the use the vibration dampners that come in the gasket kit. Then I'd have the rods sent out to someplace like rimco to be rebushed and resized and balanced. After that, you should be ready for action!
