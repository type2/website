&gt; what's going on with your drums now? are they beyond
&gt; being turned?

Wow Steve that's some bet! Flying eyeballs being as rare as
they are! ;-) We took a look at them last year and figured
we could get away with another year on them. Our brake
drums are most likely original due to the low original
mileage we had when we got the bus.

Thanks to you and Al for the info!
