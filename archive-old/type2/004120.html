Hi Volks,
    20+ years and 2 jobs ago I had available to me a grease that was great
for cv joints.  We called it moly-d which I think short for molybidum
disulfide (? spelling) and was used to pack driveshaft couplings on an
S-62 helicopter.  It was black in color, very slippery, and had a fairly
solid consistency ( high wax content I think).  I was great in CV joints as
it would stay in place, continue to be slippery for as looooong time and
would not easily become contaminated.  I don't remember the mil spec or even
the manufacturer.  Does anyone know if this is a product that is  available
to the public in reasonably small quantities?  TIA.
