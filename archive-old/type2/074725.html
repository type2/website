Subject: Re: [Re: [Re: [T2] 71 beam to 68]]

OK - i found at least 4 articles that talk about this in favor of 68-70 b=
eams
being different from 70-71.

Sorry, it will NOT. NO WAY. The physical size is different between the 64=

and
larger70-79 beams. (It's gotta be in the archives, too, BTW, I've written=
 the
same thing at least 3 times previously.)
You'll need a 68 or 69 axle beam.
Having said that, most all the parts will interchange, but you will not w=
ant
to
put in both the torsion bars from a 70 or later. They are about 220 lbs
heavier
in front and the bars are considerably stiffer. I tried this on my 69 dou=

 the
stock type and am very pleased with the performance.

&gt; List,
&gt; I found a lot of information about axle beams in the archives.
&gt;
&gt; What i didn't find was a definitive answer to the question:
&gt; Will a beam from a 1971 bus swap straight to a 1968 bus with no
mods(someone
&gt; please say yes and mean it!);p

&gt; Danke for the straight answer.
&gt;
&gt; Have you done this swap? How was it?

No, but i've put a 71 beam on a 69 with '69 parts....the job itself is a
pain, but...

&gt; &gt; I'm talkin' bout the whole thing - all the way out to the rotors.
&gt;
&gt; Yes.
&gt;
&gt; You'll probably want to switch the rear brakes out with the 71 as well,=
 or
&gt; at least enough to let you use the drums...else you'll be carrying to
&gt; spare tires (differnt lug patterns)
