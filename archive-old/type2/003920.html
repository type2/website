Hi Volks........_dot_come out and hear the folk music stylings of Tom Paxton 

and John McCutcheon (and others) at the Shenandoah Valley Music Festival
and join us for the first, and hopefully not the last, Folk-N-Wagen
campout August 31-September 2nd in Orkney Springs, VA.

Here are the details:

When:  Labor Day Weekend (August 31 - September 2)
Where: We'll camp at the Orkney Springs Campground (walking distance to
folk concert!).

Why:  Because!

Other Details:

The folk concert is Saturday (September 1st) at 6 pm.  Tickets are $18
($8 for kids under 18).  The concert site is a pavilion with lawn
seating (bring chairs or blankets) and they do allow you to bring food
and drink in as well.  Check out the website at www.musicfest_dot_org for
other details.

Other activities:  In addition to hiking, biking, and other outdoorsy
stuff, there are plenty of antique shopping opportunities in the general
area.  Of course, there is always just hanging out and visiting!  On
Sunday, September 2nd, is the Bugout in Manassas, Virginia.  For those
interested in attending that show, it's about a 2 hour drive from the
campground.

Camping Info:  I've reserved the primitive/group area.  Restrooms and
showers are available!  The camp site is a nice, large open area that
will accommodate a good many vdubs.  In addition, there are sites in the 
woods around the perimeter of the open area that will be suitable for
groups of 3 or 4 busses.  Cost is $9 per camper, per night.  The sites
with hookups (these are apart from the primitive sites) are a few extra
bucks per night.

What Do You Need to Do:  Send me an email and let me know that you plan
to attend and how many nights of camping.  Anyone interested in the
sites with hookups should arrange those with the campground directly
(540) 856-2585.  Tell them you'll be there with the VW group.  If you
want to attend the concert, buy your tickets directly from the music
festival folks.  Again, go to www.musicfest_dot_org

Directions:  Orkney Springs, VA is near I-81 about 2.5 hours from Wash
DC.  Take the Mt. Jackson exit (#273).  Go east on Rt. 703, south on US
11; right on Rt. 263 and continue on approximately 12 miles to Orkney
Springs (it really is the end of the road....you'll see what I mean).

I'll send an email out later about other details.  I hope to see a good
many of you.  Contact me via email ( at busickr_at_erols_dot_com) if you have0
questions.
