Subject: turn signal

My turn signals when activated in either direction blink externally 
together. On my turn signal switch the borwn/white and the brown wires are 
both pulled off, from a previous owner. My guess was that those two being 
off had something to do with it, but whenever i try to connect either of the 
wires to the switch and then turn on the switch, it fries the fuse its on to 
the point of near fire. my bus is a 68, 10 fuses, I have all 8 amp fuses in 
1-9 and a 16 in 10.  PLease help
