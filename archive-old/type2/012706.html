&gt;&gt; I am a little disapoingted that I can't look this up on the archives,
&gt;&gt; but...what type of oils are people using? I live in Colorado and only drive
&gt;&gt; my bus on road trips, mostly in the mountains.  Any suggestions are
&gt;&gt; appreciated.  If you don't want to clog up the list, you can p-mail me.
&gt;&gt; Thanks- Rawls Moore
&gt;
&gt;Castrol GTX 10W30 for me. Good stuff.

I'll note as usual the manual recs 10W30 or 10W40 (well actually they
deleted the 10W40 rec from the Vanagon manual as you shouldn't use it
period) only up to about 50-55F.  If you are driving over that,
particularly in
mountains you want to use what VW told you to use.   20W50 in the summer
Castrol is a great choice, and I tend to diesel weight 15W40 in the winter
which is recced to about 70F but also down to cold.  To be honest the book
says those only to 75F or so and straight 40 weight beyond that, but I
figure a modern 20W50 is solid.

My opinions only.
