Subject: Overheating (long)

--part1_122.f996c54.29eb5801_boundary

I seem to be having a problem with overheating in my '72 Westy. 1700 engine 
with
Webber dbl bbl progressive and 050 dizzy (spare me the lectures - I plan on 
taking
care of the carb and the dizzy as soon as I can) I took her for a spin today 
of no more
than 20 - 30 minutes and it got so hot that the rear bumper was hot to the 
touch.
While I had it idling, I could put my hand under the right side of the engine 
and feel
hot air being blown out. It was a strong, steady stream of air that seemed to 
not be
associated with any kind of exhaust leak. It seems to be coming from above the
engine behind the piece of tin that goes on the bottom of the heat exchanger. 
Is this
normal? I checked it out after it had cooled down and the flaps are working 
fine (right
side wide open and left side down over the oil cooler when warm) and all the 
tin and
seals are in place. I don't have a temp gauge, but will be getting one 
tomorrow to find
out exactly how hot it is. I will also be putting the stock muffler back on 
to see if that
makes a difference. 

What could my overheating problem be? Could it be associated with my other
problem - high idle? The engine idles very high. I tried to take it down 
some, but it
seems to reach a point at which it either idles high, or not at all. 

The bus runs like a bat out of hell when going down the road, but I'm not 
driving it
until I get an oil temp gauge to see just exactly how hot it is running.
