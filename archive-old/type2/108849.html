Subject: Re: [T2] EMPI muffler installation

Thanks for all of the advice.

I've gotten some advice to not attach the bracket on the muffler to the ring
that fastens around one of the manifold (exhaust extractor?) pipes.  The old
muffler was attached in this manner.

Then again, I also got advice to use the ring... ah, well...

I'm still not thrilled with the hose clamp deal, so when I picked up some
galvanized bolts this afternoon I also picked up a slightly smaller
galvanized carriage bolt.  Some judicious cutting will allow the head to
slide into the slot on the muffler bracket.

Now I have two alternatives to consider.  I've been warned to make sure that
the muffler is firmly supported, and it appears that something other than a
hose clamp was intended for that bracket.  My guess is that the OEM bracket
fastened to a rubber connector that was in turn fastened to the clamp on the
extractor pipe.

Since the muffler is bolted at one end to the extractors, it seems to make
sense that it isn't going to hurt to anchor the bracket to the same piece of
extractor pipe.  The whole thing would then vibrate as one unit, right?

I'm going to fabricate the rubber piece and use it to attach the muffler, in
place of the hose clamp.  Using a hose clamp on metal that isn't round can
lead to loosening and failure anyway.  I've seen some broke by metal to
metal contact.

I'm not concerned at this time about the loss of the muffler due to rust or
wear.  When I can afford to install a completely new exhaust system, I'll do
it up as close to OEM as I can.

The trick for the present is to placate the landlord and neighbors. :O)
