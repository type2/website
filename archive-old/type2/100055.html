Subject: FS - 74-75 deluxe westy trash stool &amp; bently service manual

Clearing the garage since I've sold my last bay window. Items are listed w/
pics on The Samba:

------------------------------------------

74-75 deluxe westy stool / trash

Trash bin / stool for deluxe westy's, includes the impossible to find yellow
trash can, all hardware and straps (no shown in pics). Blue plaid cloth on
top in good condition and so is the wood veneer. Trash can in great
condition - no cracks or damage, however the original handle is missing.

Box has two things that make it less than a perfect 10: some slight marring
on the inside edge where the strap hardware attaches, and there is a small
hole in the bottom (about the size of a nickle), otherwise it's in perfect
shape.

------------------------------------------

68-79 bus Bently workshop manual

Good condition - hardly used. A couple smudges, but no rips, greasy
fingerprints or other damage. I sold the bus so now I don't need the manual.

------------------------------------------

I have a bunch of other parts, including westy interior stuff and FI engine
parts if anyone needs anything specific!
