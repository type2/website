Subject: RE: [T2] Can't get lug nuts off!

Heat the lugs with a torch. Sometimes that helps to break them free.
I've heard of people heating lugs with torches, then pressing a candle
against them. The idea is that the molten wax will wick into the
threads.

Also spray them repeatedly with PB Blaster

Be careful not to strip them. You might try taking them to a different
shop with some higher power lug wrenches.

I am having new tires installed at Costco and they can't get the Lug
Nuts off.  Said they had their torque wrench up to 330lbs and they would
not budge.  What happened?  did the drums overheat causing them to
freeze or something?  I busted 5 different lug wrenches with a 4 foot
cheater bar trying to get them off.  Any suggestions?
