I have found some people try this by cutting and brazing the smaller carb
mount on the top. I don't think its a good idea though.

Subject: [T2] Newbie with intake manifold question


Hi everyone, I am new to this list. My bus is '72
Westfalia. The question I have is this: Is there an
intake manifold that would allow the adaptation of a
single 2 bbl carb? has anyone out there had any
experience with such a setup and would you reccommend it
or not?
