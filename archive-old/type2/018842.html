To elaborate on an already-made suggestion:  the Muir book gives an enormous
amount of step-by-step.  It really is the first book you need.  The Bentley
manual is easier for me (still a beginner) than the Haynes; lots more
pictures and more clearly written.

One other point:  the archives are at www.type2_dot_com.  Many questions you'll
have, have been asked before.  Search the archives before asking here.
Watch your spelling when searching.  Computers are less than tolerant of
stupid human error... :-)

If the bus has no title you'll need to clear that up first.  That's been
discussed here already.
