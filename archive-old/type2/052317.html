Subject: [T2] Looking for the correct list

Howdy, I've been lurking here for a while. I need to know a list where I
can sell a 1970 camper. This list seems more like a troubleshooter list
and I wish I'd known about it
back when I did all my own small maintenance.
     What information will they want? I know I should list that it has
180,000 miles on it, has always been garaged and has complete
maintenance records from when I bought it.
All manuals are present. I haven't the foggiest idea of what the van is
worth. -Pete-
