Subject: Phoenis Aridzona, Emissions

When you bring your VW into Emissions, tell the driver NOT to put it into
4th gear. They only have to maintain a 30 MPH speed. If they up shift to 4th
gear your motor will load up. This is bad because after this test, they do
the idle  test. This will make it difficult to pass on idle. VWs are famous
for failing on idle. 3rd gear is all you need for 30MPH. !!!
