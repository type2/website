Subject: 79 BUS ELECTRONIC IGNITION 

Thanks Karl ! I will get back to you on that . The reasons that you listed
are why I want to change to electronic ignition . Also sustained high RPMs
breaks points down easily . I need to rebuild my motor , it has over 100,000
miles on it and it has developed an oil leak that is really bad at high
RPMs. In fact it will coat the back of the van if I drive it on the highway
for a long time . It's time to do it . I'm a good mechanic , infact I did it
professionally for 13 years BUT not on VWs . I love the thing though and it
will get the service it needs . I will keep in touch .
