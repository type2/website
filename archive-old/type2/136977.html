&gt; One total PITA will be curtains...  finding a source for the damned

&gt; even, even at $20-30/yard (think $2-300 for enough to make all the
&gt; curtains for a bus).  I *BELIEVE* this same material was used from 
&gt; '64-73,
&gt; so there should be a market!

I feel your pain... I ended up having to compromise on color and weave 
on my '76 Westy's curtains.  That German-army-olive-green color is 
~impossible to find.

Anyway, PLFVW sells splitty curtain sets made from fabric that is a 
VERY close match to the original:

...but they're not cheap... $700 for a set.
