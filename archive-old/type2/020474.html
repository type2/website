I used this to treat surface rust around my windows when I changed them
out. It's awesome stuff, but you need to realize that it's actually an
epoxy compound that you mix up and have to use within 4-6 hours before
it sets up on ya. It's also pretty pricey. Doing a whole roof with it
would be a pretty ambitious project, but it'd last forEVER! :-) And it's
very, very shiny.
