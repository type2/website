Subject: parts for sale

I still have a 78 tranny and 73 tranny for sale. Have a good 2.0l block and 
short block 1700 which needs the exhaust manifold bolt holes helicoiled but the 
motor only has 15000 miles. Have original step for slding door area, aluminum 
I think.  Make offer moving and need to sell. We are also in Buffalo NY so we 
would have to figure out how to get it wherever you might be.  Dylan
