Just an FYI, the guy specializes in Type I engines and for a while, he took
every opportunity to slam anyone thinking about Type IV motors.  Be careful
that the engine is built for a bus and not to race when he gets done.  The
archives of R.A.M.V.A (newsgroup) are FILLED with his comments.  What better
than to read for yourself.

&gt; I am looking at having Strictly German Autowerks in Portland, OR for a
&gt; 1679cc motor for my bus.  New case &amp; Heads, CW crank, etc.   Does anybody
&gt; have any experience with or insight on this company?
&gt;
&gt; Before I plunk down my money I'd love to hear some feedback!   I tried to
&gt; check the archive but didn't have any luck!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
