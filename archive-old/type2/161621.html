Subject: Progressive jetting

Hey All,
Can some one give me an idea of where I am as far as jetting on my 
progressive carb? I have pretty major hesitation starting away from a stop. 
Timing is good, 009 distributor, points are good. Idle is a bit rough but 
that may be another story. Anyhoo, back to the jets. primary idle is a 70, 
secondary is a 50. Once warmed up, power is good and lively (for a bus). Any 
ideas or opinions??
Thanks,
Jeff
