Subject: The 232,000mi bus lost a clutch cable!

Well, the 232,000 mi engine turneth yet, but yesterday evening about 12
mi from home I felt a pop in the clutch pedal at the McDonald's window
and the bus began to self move.  Killed the ignition, smiled sheepishly,
said &quot;Oops, just broke the clutch cable&quot;, and started it up in first,
lurching away at the same time.  It was too cold to shift just using rpm
matching and so I drove home at a very slow 12 mph in first gear!  Now
mind you, I changed the original cable at 150,000 mi and it was still
working; but this lasted only 80,000- and failed right at the junction
of the cable to the threads, twanging all but 2 &quot;subcables&quot;.  Has
quality gone downhill?  Does the LUK heavy duty release plate have too
much tension compared to the stock one?  Beats me, but today I got out
the spare...messing with grease is no fun in 20 deg weather and quit
after finally getting it down the tube.  I'll finish it next year (-8 
FROHES NEUES JAHR!
