Subject: carbs, beeps, lights, boats, pliugs, and a wookie

Hey list! I have a few unrelated questions.

1.  I have a moaning in my front end which is loud enough for me to rename
Klunk to &quot;The Blue Wookie&quot;.  At first I thought it may be a brake cylinder
locking up but now I am starting to think that all I need is a simple
bearing job. I did the rock-the-tire test and it is obvious they need to be
repacked, maybe even replaced. Could bad bearings cause a moan? It is most
noticeable at low speeds and while turning.  I also need to replace a couple
of ball joints, but I don't think they could cause a constant moan like I am
getting.

2.  I have a short somewhere that causes my horn to blow every once in a
while. I know its a short becuase I hear the teltale crackling of 12v when
it happens.  What else is on the same circuit as the horn, if anything? I
took off the cover to the steering column and all the wires look to be in
good shape. I couldn't see any fried wires and there are no shorts in the
pressure switch in the steering wheel. Any ideas?

3.  Were brights (headlights) not a standard thing on 80 Vanagons? After a
year I still haven't figured out if I should have them or not.

4. Has anyone experimented with jetting a 32/36 DFAV Weber with a type 4
engine?  I get really crappy mileage (15mpg avg.) and was wondering if maybe
it could be the jets.  Also, just to be sure, is the springed (SP) screw on
the bottom of the carb under the choke the mixture screw? I am almost
poitive it is but I need to be sure.

5.  I need to put a trailer hitch on the van to tow a boat but I can't for
the life of me figure where to attach one.  Where does everyone have their
hitches hitched?  Also what kinds work well and where would I get one? It is
just a small jon boat trailer so I dont need anything that can haul a ton.

6.  As I stated before I need to replace some ball joints (3 to be exact). I
also need an alignment. Which one should I do first, or does it matter?

7.  I live in Florida and was wondering if I should be using spark plugs
from a higher heat range? I get a little more carbon on the pulgs than I am
comfortable with and thought it could be the plugs' fault. I have a stock
coil, 205S (vac advance) dizzy, and a Pertonix unit.

I think thats about it (yeah right) :). Thanks a kagillion for your time.
