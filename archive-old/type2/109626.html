Subject: accel_dot_cable

My 72 that I just bought had the weirdest makeshift attachment for the
accelerator cable to the throttle lever.  There were three different springs
(one from the coil to the throttle lever, one from the top of the engine
compartment to the throttle lever and one from the back of the engine
compartment to the bar that connects the two carbs throttle levers) and these
springs were not doing a bit of good to help with giving the thing any gas.
Anyhow, I have to find out what I need to get this thing to work.  My Muir
manual doesn't give me a picture of what I should be looking for (it only give
a picture of pre-68) as far as a throttle pin or whatever it's called.  So,
I'm asking all of you, what should I be searching for to attach my accelerator
cable to the throttle lever?

Thanks gang.

Paul
