Subject: Yep, it's a PCV valve ... sort of

[talking to himself, it seems]

There's a little bit about this valve in the archives. Not a lot (it's 
established that the &quot;air breather valve&quot; is NLA). The list-recommended 
&quot;test&quot; is to blow through both ends. It should be easy one way, 
difficult the other say the archives.

Well, it should be easy one way and impossible the other. The way back 
into the case is supposed to be completely restricted, in case of a 
backfire. As for the &quot;blow&quot; test, I am dubious. There is a lot of gunk 
in these things, and I doubt they are as effective as they should be.

My working hypothesis as of this afternoon is that the space between 
the top of the valve and the thin rubber diaphragm is pressurized (or 
at least it was pressurized 25-30 years ago); pressure from exhaust 
gases overcomes the pressure inside this little bladder and allows the 
gas to pass into the restricted aperture. Don't know how this restricts 
backfire pressure.

An ineffective PCV valve can lead to oil leaks, which is just what we 
don't need more of. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if many pushrod 
tube seal leaks are actually caused by faulty PCV valves.

Seems to be that the fix for this is to turn the &quot;air breather valve&quot; 
into a relatively unrestricted elbow by boring out the end of the 
nozzle, then cleaning the whole thing out. After that, an aftermarket 
PCV needs to be installed in the hose leading to the boot between the 
AFM and the throttle. It probably makes sense to match the aftermarket 
PCV to the displacement of the engine while getting as close to the 
hose size as possible.

I'm willing to listen to other suggestions, though.
