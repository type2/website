Subject: Performance and/or Stainless Steel Exhaust for 72-74  and/or 79-83 vans

I need to replace my (non cat) exhaust system. The systems on 
72-74 buses are interchangable with those on air cooled 
Vanagons. SO I have a few options I am sure.

Does anyone sell a complete Stainless Steel one? Anyone on 
the list have a good experience with performance exhaust? I 
was looking at:

Thanks,
Chris
