Gray market also covers Canadian Forces overseas.  They have an even easier 
time then we US military folks.  I brought back a Ostermsan Speedster Beetle 
from Germany 3 years ago.  I had to change the head lights, Speedo, motor to 
a stock 1600.  This is where the M codes really come in handy to see if it is 
a German or European original
or an export.  Good luck and trust me I'm gonna try it next with a new bus 
out of England, yep I said new since they still make them brand spanken new.  
Costly but oh well.  There's no price on insanity.  Either way it's a keeper. 
 Good luck..
