Subject: VDO Tach DIP Switch Settings

Hello All,

I just got a VDO tach and a friend of mine told me he saw some traffic on problems with this on the list.  I've had some computer (operator?) problems which resulted in many lost files and non-receipt of mail.  My friend already deleted the message when I asked him.  Could whoever has the problem/solution please email me privately with what this was about?  FWIW I thought the instructions were pretty straight forward, but I don't want to fry my tach.

Thanks, and happy holidays,
