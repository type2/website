Subject: Re: [T2] 80 vanagon adventures

Steve:
Well, that makes mine different than either of them. It has the  BA-6 but no
fresh air  fans! and just the moulded parcel shelf instead of the glove box.
Where I'm headed with all this is that I'd like to install a  fresh air fan,
especially since an upcoming job is replacing one of the wiper transmissions,
which means taking out the dash and air distributor box anyway. I have access
to an 82 parts car.
I hope the whole air distributor box will just interchange.
BTW, what's up with this metal 80-only air intake you mentioned?

&gt;  One other thing I just thought of as I sit here at home
&gt; (too late, dammit)  is that I did not check the Westy for a gas heater
&gt; switch.  My '80 has both the fan and glove box but it does have the BA-6
&gt; as well.  It makes sense that to include the fan in a vehicle equipped
&gt; with a &quot;stationary heater.&quot;
