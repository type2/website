&gt;For me, 50hp is not enough.

????????????????

Is this really so much different from my 1600DP?

The only bus that I have ever driven that had an appreciable difference in
performance was a '78 2.0 f/i.  Not even the 1.8 had enough of a power
increase for me to notice it, so I really don't see the big improvement.
Apparently neither did VW, because they saw fit to install the 1600 up
into the Vanagon years.

I don't think I'll get rid of my bus just to be rid of a gland nut and
add 6 hp.
