&gt; 2.) Just what is a &quot;vapor lock&quot; anyways? I've never heard this term 
&gt; defined in any context.

Vapor lock is when the gasoline in your fuel lines gets so hot it boils.
The gasoline vapor fills the line and when it gets to the pump, the pump
stops pumping.  The diaphram pump on VW's is not set up to pump vapor and
it just won't.  So you &quot;run out of gas&quot;.  You then get to sit for 1/2 hr
or an hour while everything cools down belows the boiling point of
gasoline, the gasoline condenses and then the pump can pump the liquid
again.  The solution is to keep the gas lines away from hot things (like
the exhaust manifold).
