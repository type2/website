Subject: Re: [T2] ask no quarter..(altering tail lights)

Mitch,

If you were ever involved in an accident, regardless of who or what caused 
it, the other party could claim that you altered your tail lights, turn 
signals and brake lights thus deliberately reducing their visibility to other 
drivers and causing or contributing to the accident.

They could also claim that your modifications increased the damage done to 
either their vehicle or their persons and request a larger claim or lawsuit $ 
amount.

Even if your modification had no role in the cause or severity of the 
accident you give &quot;them&quot; something that could be used against you and thus 
drag things out even longer.
