Allen,

The plugs for those holes are at pretty nearly any VW FLAPS.  
Busdepot_dot_com and aircooled_dot_net should both have them on the net ( VW part
# 113 609 163).  And they ought to be there!  A fair amount of water can
get in thru those holes, and it definitely affects brake performance.  If
the wheel on one side gets wet and the other side does not (a curb-side
puddle, ferinstance), the dry side will brake much better and the bus will
veer next time you step on the brakes.  Not pretty.

On the e-brake cables, they can be easy, they were designed to be easy,
and when they were new, they probably were easy to replace, but 20+ years
of rust can make it the job from hell.  My major hangup is the nut and
bolt that hold the tube to the brake backing plate.  This is usually a
real bear to get off :-(  Other than that, it is no tougher than
replacing a clutch cable.

&gt; Hey Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; Was wondering if you knew anything about the covers that apparently cover
&gt; up the peep holes on the rear drum backing plate?  You know the ones that
&gt; allow you to check your shoe lining.
&gt; 
&gt; I saw it mentioned in this thread and realized that I don't have any and
&gt; was wondering if I should look into picking some up or finding a suitable
&gt; fix...  How much water do you think get's in there?
&gt; 
&gt; Also have you ever replaced e-brake cables?  Wondering how bad it is going
&gt; to be and if there were any secrets.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
