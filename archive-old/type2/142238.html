Subject: Re: [T2] Warning : What a bad clutch driven plate will do to 
  your bus

 &lt;&lt;I balance several engines per year and the PP always is way out of
whack,&gt;

This is a lot to say about whomever your buying the PP's from Scott.

I'd serioulsy consider locating a new supplier.

Anything spinning at any RPM can have a harmonic point of
vibration---absolutley.

If you guys were talking flywheels--without a doubt you are correct.

BUT--the PP doesn't have the mass to create that much of a harmonic
vibration as the , lets say, the flywheel or the harmonic balancer on
any engine.

Not enough weight on the spinning mass to create that big of a buzz.

Besides, when the clutch is locked up to the flywheel, the balanced
flywheel weight will overcome the small amount of inbalance the PP might
have.

And the VW engine doesn't spin that fast to even get into a buzzing area
of any RPM range anyhow--not for too long a time anyway.

The springs blowing out of the disc are really a non-issue too--

They are too close to the inside of the rotating mass to create any big
time vibrations. 

I'm gonna make some phone calls to the Chevy and Mopar freaks and see
what they have to say on this PP balancing issue.

They will think I'm looney for sure.

Gotta Go--
