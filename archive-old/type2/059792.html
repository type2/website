Gordon:

I'm not familiar enough with Oklahoma's geography to know how near or
far they are from Stillwater, but I've done [long distance] business
with:

 Wilson's Auto Salvage
 P. O. Box 180
 Lexington, OK 73051

 (800) 347-2847

They seem like fine folks who know buses.  I got an excellent axle beam
from them via UPS.
