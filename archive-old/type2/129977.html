Subject: Re: seating

When we moved to Spain we took our '71 deluxe with us. It did not have seat 
belts in it at the time for the middle seat. The rear were there from the 
factory. We had to go to a VW dealer to buy the middle seat belts in order 
to pass our inspection. The rule was that all possible seating positions 
must have seat belts. Not like we ever saw anyone actually use them, they 
were all riding 6 up on a moped!

My brother and I would fall asleep on the floor, one in the back and one in 
the front part of the rear area. That way we each had a heating duct and 
the engine and road noise could lull us to sleep.

&gt;My 71(I just sold) jump has the seatbelts but I do remember the our 68 had
&gt;no belts in the rear.  I also recall setting on the stool as a 14 year old &amp;
&gt;ending up with my face in the kick plate under the dash.  Facing the rear my
&gt;be the safest direction anyway.
