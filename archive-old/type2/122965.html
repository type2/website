Subject: Need a steering wheel, and some hinges.

Hey all,
Seeking one steering wheel for my 71' bay, in good condition at a decent 
price.  Also in need of new engine hatch hinges.  For some reason I 
destroyed my steering wheel with the wrong puller, and rust has claimed the 
latter.  Thanks thanks thanks.

Jamal Floate
