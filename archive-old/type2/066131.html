Subject: Re: '71 TRANS PROBLEM - STUCK IN GEAR

Scott,

Same thing happened to one of our vans a couple of years ago when our
daughter fought with the gearshift and got it stuck in fourth. The
thing NOT to do is try to force the tranny into gear, because you risk
breaking the bracket. 

Check the linkage first, but it really sounds like you broke the $15
bracket (available from the dealer only) that is located just inside
the nose of the tranny. The nose is on the front (FRONT is FRONT). It
is really fairly simple to replace, and if you are careful and use a
modest amount of Permatex 2, you won't have to replace the gasket,
though the gasket doesn't cost much.

Good luck.

Bob

&gt; Hey Volks!
&gt; 
&gt; Here's my problem --
&gt; 
&gt; Last night I met Maggie at an event where she was a speaker. It was at the Rio 
&gt; Hotel. I pulled my van in to the valet, got my ticket and went in. About 4 
&gt; hours later when I picked up the van the attendant says, with a sheepish grin, 
&gt; &quot;I couldn't get it out of first gear...&quot; Having messed with the shifter and 
&gt; knowing that if it's not adjusted right it can act pretty odd I pulled out and 
&gt; into a parking lot to check that expecting loose bolts. But as I pulled out 
&gt; the lever will _not_ move and it feels very strange. The reverse lock-out 
&gt; doesn't push down with the right feeling. And the bolts were tight and the 
&gt; shifter, when removed and put back in was OK. So, I went back to try to find 
&gt; someone who had a clue what happened --  but no one did. It was about 12:30 
&gt; when I finally got the van and me home courtesy of AAA.
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't had an opportunity to look at anything yet but thought I'd query the 
&gt; list to see if this stuck in gear trick has happened to anyone else and if so, 
&gt; what it was that they found wrong. What should I be looking for? What's the 
&gt; worst case? I've been through the linkage (replaced bushings where I could - 
&gt; 7-8 months ago) and just can't visualize where that might bind.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; -Scott
