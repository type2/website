&gt; &gt; Anybody familiar with the process to &quot;raise&quot; effaced serial numbers from a
&gt; &gt; body part (chassis, say)? Heat, machinist's ink?? I know law enforcement
&gt; &gt; bodies do this regularly, but I'm not aware of the process.

it's a metalurgical process that &quot;sees&quot; the metal stresses from the
stamping....check with your state police they might be able to give you a
lead on who does it locally.

&gt; Are you trying to transfer the numbers to a sheet of paper? You could just
&gt; make a rubbing--lay a sheet of paper over the serial number and rub over it
&gt; with a crayon/pencil/colored chalk.


that works great if someone hasn't tried to hide the numbers
