&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I got an email yesterday from VWOA. It was to informing me of the
&gt; &quot;Enthusiast Licensing Program&quot;. The email told me:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The Internet Licensing Program is a free program and offers VW Clubs
&gt; &gt; and Enthusiasts the opportunity to apply for a license to use
&gt; &gt; Volkswagen trademarks and service marks on the Internet and in
&gt; &gt; Internet domain names if certain conditions are met.
&gt;
&gt; But now this.... Is VW actually turning the ship in a new direction?
&gt;

I wonder if they managed to harass someone who had the means to call their
bluff?  After all, if a site isn't making money, defaming VW, or
&quot;diluting&quot; their trademark they really don't have a case.  All they
really have is the potential for litigating the site holder or club to
death.

By creating a registration process, VW gives the impression that a
registration is required, which legally it is not as long as you don't
profit, defame, or &quot;dilute&quot;.

George
