-Somebody in the list know about this problem or maybe already experienced it?



 
Roberto,
 
Are you talking about BIG hills during travel or just little small hills to get across town?  We had really bad problems with our timing when we drove from Seattle to Charleston and we had to go over the Rocky Mountains.  We thought it was a fuel issue, too, but as soon as we figured out that it was the timing, we fixed it and the problems went away. The feeling your bus will give you feels a lot like fuel starvation.  If you're just driving through town, though, I can't offer too much advice.  Try driving backwards??
