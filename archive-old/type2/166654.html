Subject: Re: [T2] Innovate LM-1 AFR Meter

&gt; I would beg to differ.  I currently have the LC-1 installed and use  
&gt; an inexpensive AFR 10-led meter that is made to read narrowband  
&gt; (0-1v) meters and it works great.

I installed one last month. It works just fine but it's more for the  
person who likes a wiring project in my opinion.

Once thing I thought was a little deceptive were the photos:

http://innovatemotorsports_dot_com/support/quickstart/LC-1_Quickstart.pdf

The quickstart guide shows 3 views of the same thing and they are  
careful to hide all the exposed wires that are actually part of the  
cable.

&gt; It's all the price of convenience - 200 for a LC-1 or 350 for a  
&gt; LM-1 that does essentially the same thing with a big meter.

The LM-1 also captures log info without the use of a laptop.

I built a project box for the LC-1 to give it some portability so I  
have an idea of which one I think is more convenient.

&gt; But if you're pretty technically savvy and would like a more custom  
&gt; installation while spending less $$$, I'd definitely recommend the  
&gt; LC-1 and a cheap-o AFR meter to install in your dash.

You mean $150 vs. a lot of wiring effort? That's all I'm saying: LM-1  
is plug and play: you have to pay for it but it's worth it.

If I had a Megasquirt, I'd go with the LC-1.
