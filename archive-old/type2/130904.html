Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Paint -it-yourselfers

I know its not quite the answer you were originally looking for, but I 
figured I'd throw it out there for those in a similar situation to me.
When I got my bus it looked like it had been spayed with house paint in the 
last year or two. They didn't do a very good job of sanding and it is very 
rough.  Now years later it is starting to rust (They probably just painted 
over surface rust that has spread now) and it looks filthy. I think it won't 
come clean because they used flat paint.  So I am in the process of 
repainting it. I went out and bought a small can of rust inhibiting auto 
primer. I'm sanding down all the rust and spot priming. (with a brush.)  
Then I'm going to wet sand everything.  Then I plan on cutting and rolling 
it with some exterior house paint.  If I find someone who can loan me a 
sprayer I'll probably use that.  But if I have any money to put into my bus 
it has to go into making it run better, and not look better.
While some may consider this blasphamy, It will keep it from rusting for a 
while and will look better than it does now.  So don't be discouraged if you 
can't afford a real good paint job. The important thing is to stop the rust.
Remember, chrome won't get you home.
Peace,
