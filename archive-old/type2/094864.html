Subject: RE: [T2] The new pertronix ignitor II, and the 009 problems



&gt;Eron, I think you are right.

Now if I could just get my wife to utter that phrase...

Hey Chris!  Great research!   The Crane XR1000 I use requires you to toss 
the Bosch(or brand of choice) coil out with the bathwater(points), and use a 
coil that will accept 12v directly.  I went with the 40kv Crane model, but I 
suppose you could use Accel, or MSD, etc. YPMV. I cannot stress enough what 
a difference this has made on my type 1 engine.  Now if it only had 
hydraulic lifters...

	Eron
