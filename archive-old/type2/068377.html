Subject: Juddering clutch: solved

Thank you to everyone who made suggestions about the juddering clutch on my
1982 bus. I bit the bullet and used my very good local mechanic to replace
the clutch. He had to get the flywheel skimmed because it had a completely
flaky surface - rough, scored and pitted. This was the culprit, and it
would have eaten the new clutch.
Now it runs very well; the pedal (hydraulic) is light and as smooth as
silk, and take up is largely smooth. Do you have to go easy on the clutch
at first to wear it in?
