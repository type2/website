&gt; On the subject of temp. senders, how difficult is it to remove the FI Head
&gt; temp sender?  I've never changed this, and have owned my bus since 1989.  I
&gt; am worried it is stuck in the head, and will booger the hole when I try to
&gt; get it out. Any tips??

The hole is very small and I didn't have a problem replacing my original
sender.

The hardest part is getting in there with a tool because I couldn't get it
out with my fingers. One of those 13mm ratcheting box end wrenches works
wonders.
