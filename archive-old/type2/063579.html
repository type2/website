Subject: VW 'Workshop' Get Together 9/22

hey now,

well, i'm doing work on the new '77 Westy..tenatively named Misha..on
sunday. richard has kindly agreed to come over and help with bleeding the
brakes and other fun things. i thought it would be cool to have a gathering
of local folks who would like get together and do various mechanical things,
drink a few brews and just talk vw.

i'll hopefully have a halfshaft off and will be inspecting the cv joints and
then repacking and reinstalling them. i've done it once and have limited
experience but if anyone wants to learn i'm willing to show. it can be
frustrating. i'll also be bleeding the brakes, doing valves, and may be
installing a starter. i also have gauges to install on the '74. i'm sure
others have stuff they need to do. there are things i'd like to learn and
perhaps we swap some knowledge.

if anyone is interested drop me an email and we'll see what happens. all
ya need is your bus/or other vw, some of your favorite brew/soda/bottled water/
whatever, tools, work clothes, and any needed parts.

i'll be doing the work even if no one shows up! :-)

take care,

jonathan
