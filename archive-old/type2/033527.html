Subject: Re: rebuild decided!

You may be able to get a shop to pull your engine and install your AVP
engine, but I'm guessing someone has put in a Type 3 or Porsche engine,
since your oil filler and dipstick are not standard. Can you get pictures
of your engine and put them on your website so someone can try to ID them
for you?

AVP may or may not be interested in taking your engine as a core. They're
going to want the kind they rebuild and if you have a Type 3 or
Porsche...well, I'm just not sure and neither will they be until they see
it. And you pay shipping both ways. It can get expensive if you don't know
what you're sending them. 

My advice is to post pictures ASAP and get some idea of what you have. If
it's a Porsche engine, you might be able to talk someone into doing the
engine swap in exchange for the engine itself. Of course, you might also be
in the situation where in addition to the engine you need a fuel system
(carb/FI), exhaust, heat exchangers, etc., driving the price of your engine
up to maybe over twice as much as you're planning to spend. The reason I
say this is because, no knowing what you have in there now, I don't know if
the parts you have will be compatible with a stock engine for your bus. Any
way to contact the PO and ask?

It looks like a nice camping bus, so I'm glad you're planning to bring it
back to life. The worst thing that could happen is that you jump into this
both feet first only to find after spending 1300 on a rebuild that you need
another 1300 in parts before you get it running....and with (I presume) the
clock already ticking on an engine warranty.

Whatever you have to put into it, it'll be worth it to you. You can't get
your family into a good running motor home for $2600 or $4000 or
$5000...and if you could, how would you afford gas for it? But you also
don't want to be blindsided by unexpected expenses. That's why many car
projects get abandoned mid-shift.

Good luck! Joe
