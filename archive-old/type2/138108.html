Well, the absence of sealant made no contribution to my engine problem. 
I can't remember who suggested doing without. It was someone on this 
list whose judgment I trusted (and who turned out to be right).

I don't think that sealants are snake oil, exactly. I do tend to think 
(a) that if the case parting surfaces have a problem, then sealant 
won't solve it, (b) case sealant, poorly applied, is far more likely to 
kill an engine (by closing or restricting oil returns), (c) applying it 
uniformly is probably an art, and (d) careful torquing of the case 
bolts is probably much more important.
