Subject: Re: HEAT:Combustion or Friction?

&gt;
&gt;Next time your van runs out of gas at the top of a very steep hill, put 'er in
&gt;4th and ride down the hill with the engine engaged (being turned by the
&gt;force of
&gt;gravity, not internal combustion). Think she'll get hot? I *don't* think so.
&gt;Might louse up something else, but it won't be from heat.

I'm confused...this paragraph seems to contradict the one I'm about to
comment on.


&gt;Which came first? The chicken or the egg? When you compress anything, air, for
&gt;example, it gets hot.

Actually, this not really true.  The thing compressed get's very cold, and
a lot of heat is given off (so the coils feel hot in the back of the frig,
but the freon, if you were to touch it, would be cold).  This is the way a
frig (ac) works-- the freon, as it expands after compression, sucks in heat
from the interior of the frig (room) and gets hot itself.



Now how this helps the arg of where all the heat comes from I know not.
Engines are not very efficient; most of the burned gas's energy is given
off as heat, not downward force.  And some of that force is lost to
friction (converted to heat).

But who cares?  Engines get hot.  Keep your tin airtight, and your oil
changed and topped off, and we won't have to worry until millions of years
hence when there's so much entropy that our existance is totally fractal.
