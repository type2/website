Subject: Re: [T2] I'm getting the busloops - straying from the topic

&quot;Ghia based on some college girls' complaint that it was &quot;too much of a PITA to put the top up and down.&quot;

PITA to put the top down? How much easier did this girl need? &lt;grin!&gt; You can do it from the driver's seat can't you? 

STAY AWAY from this type of girl... &lt;grin!&gt; 

I dated one once. Daddy took care of her TOO well and she was un-marry-able. Couldn't deal with the first few years of being young, married, and broke. I asked her if she could handle help me finish college (if we were married, I was fresh out of the Navy). A worried look came over her face, she wanted to be a stay at home wife. Asked her if she would help me BUILD (not buy) a nice house in 7-10 years. Another worried look, didn't go along with her country club dream. Finally asked her as I was leaving town to go to the college town I was living in if she wanted to go to lunch dutch b/c she was working and I was unemployeed having just completed an enlistment in the Navy (at a measly $14K a year) and I had to buy gas to get home and I wanted to eat with her. She freaked out and I said enough is enough. (After paying for a nice 2 week vacation in Italy a year prior, meals, trips, presents, etc.... We had dated off and on for a few years.)

I've driven a few power topped cars, but I prefer the manual top our Cabrio has since I've got to get out and put the boot on anyhow and less to break during a freak rain shower. Of course the exception would be the Saab I drove once with the power hardcover over the folded top. I could get used to that... &lt;grin!&gt; 

I'm happily married these days (7 years Nov) but it was easier to be a car nut (and suffer from busloop) when I was a single guy. I could eat Ramen noodles for a month to save up for some percieved automotive need like 4 disc brakes for my Beetle without debate or feeling like the family's needs are getting neglected... Luckily I married a WONDERFUL girl that tolerates and even supports my VW affliction as much as her good sense allows. Heck she even mourned selling our Kawasaki Concours way back when more than I did... I think I'll keep her. 

The house building starts next year... 2.5 acre wooded lot purchase in the next two weeks we hope.
