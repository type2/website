Subject: Help needed: Headlight wiring on 1975 bus

Hi Volks,

I have looked at the wiring diagrams at type2_dot_com but can't match up  
what I see there to reality. I am working on a 1975 westy.

There is a thick white wire coming out of the D/S headlight bucket  
that leads to the fuse box. The connector on this wire broke and the  
headlights are no longer working. If I connect this wire to a power  
source it lights up the D/S light only, regardless of the switch  
position. The light switch runs the parking lights ok but does not  
light up either headlight.

We are trying to get this bus ready for a 4-hour drive to BusFusion  
this weekend and I'd like to have the headlights working.

Thanks!
