Subject: 1979 Hot Air

Hi, All.

I've finally gotten the engine (mostly) in my '79 California. This 
engine came out of a donor, also a '79 cali model, so I should have two 
of everything, right? Well, I took all this apart last year, before I 
got a touch of cancer and had to put everything on hold. Now I can't 
remember a few details, and I need some help.

The '79 has pipes that carry the hot air that dumps out of the heater 
control boxes when the heat is shut off to the rear of the bus, and they 
look something like exhaust pipes, one for each side (wow! Duals!). 
Anyhow, the pipe is held onto the van with two bolts &amp; nuts into the 
bracket for the mustache bar, and extends up under the van toward the 
heater control but stops about 14&quot; short. Does anyone have any idea what 
goes between the pipe and the control? Some kind of flexible tubing? I 
don't remember taking anything off.

Additionally, I wound up with only two right side pipes. I'm looking for 
a left side one. Anybody got one?

Another perplexion. On the left side, the engine tin doesn't enclose the 
exhaust manifold. The first four pics on http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~airhedz/
illustrate what I'm taking about. Is this supposed to be open?

Thanks in advance for your comments.
