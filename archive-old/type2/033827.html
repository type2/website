Subject: Richard Kurtz

Oh my gosh. I didnt realize who he was. Richard is the guy I got my '71
single cab from and some parts. I know he sold the Thing awhile back to
someone in Jax. I tried to keep him up todate on the progress of the cab so
he knew it had a good home.

I just got an email from him a couple of weeks ago saying he was doing ok,
but in some pain because of the swelling.

I visited with Richard a few times these past couple of months. I wish I had
known him in his healthy days. He seemed like a very nice gentleman.

If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know. It only an hours
drive from my house.

David
