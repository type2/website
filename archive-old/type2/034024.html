&gt; &gt; I'm talking about the 90 degree bend at the top of the filler neck

&gt; This part is unavailable for now, having been discontinued by VW in
&gt; Germany
&gt; (who also supplied Motorworks, West Coast Metric, myself, and
&gt; everybody
&gt; else)...
&gt; ...I suspect that the problem will be solved

Since this seems to be a part that causes considerable trouble
(especially with &quot;modern&quot; gas nozzles), might it be better to make an
upgraded part.  How about a formed metal tube that can be attached with
short straight sections of hose on each end.

(The reason I thought of this is that Datsun went the other way and
replaced a good metal filler pipe with a rubber filler pipe without
changing the filler location.  The metal pipes were a prime wrecking
yard find after the &quot;improved&quot; rubber filler pipes started to fail.)
