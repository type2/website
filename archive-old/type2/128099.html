Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Tires  ?

If you have Les Schwab Tires near you, they have a Jupiter SV-820 in
the correct size (185R14) rated at 1875lbs. 809 rev's per mile, 25.7&quot;
diameter, if you're trying to figure out how well your new set will
work with your speedo. When I bought them (Pearl District Les Schwab),
the mgr said that he'd sold that tire onto 4 buses in the previous
couple of weeks. Other listees?
Personally, I like Les Schwab for their lifetime free rotation and road
side assistance for tire failures, free mounting, etc. No, I don't work
for them. I got a full set 2 months ago (plus a spare), and they have
treated me very well. Very little wander, good traction in rain, solid
over potholes, not very loud, firm ride (but not uncomfortably stiff),
corners well. The SV-820 is the same code as another listee found in
the &quot;Capitol&quot; name in the Bay Area. I don't know for sure if they're
the same tire, but they might be. In the Library, there's a whole
section dedicated to tires. I don't know how recently it was updated,
but that might be a good place to start your research.
Good Luck,
