Subject: RE:  No power and inconsistant idle

&gt; The problem is, I set my idle speed to 900 but it will not maintain 
&gt;after it warms up and then ranges from 600 to 1000 rpm.  When 
&gt;pressing the gas at idle the engine revs but when driving the bus 
&gt;just jurks and engine will not rev up.  I just put this rebuilt moter 

Sounds to me like an over-lean carburetor.  What type/size engine?
Modifications?  What carb(s) or FI?
