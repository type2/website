Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel injectors / pressure

From: &quot;Dave C. Bolen&quot;
&gt;NO!  You will burn the injectors...especially if you do it without the
&gt;resistors in line.

&gt;Apparently, you can make it happen pretty quickly too...anything more than
&gt;a few seconds and Poof!...ya let the magic smoke out.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anybody out there have a setup so they could bench test injectors? I was 
thinking of doing this myself, good thing I didn't try and &quot;let the magic 
smoke out&quot; of them. What is the voltage/amps that power the injectors? What 
is the pulse rate? I would like to be able to bench test some injectors 
before i go installing everything.
