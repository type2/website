Subject: stange lock

Hello wonderful people,
	Here is a strange item I hope someone has run into in the vast experience
of the list.
	On the nose of my new '73 westy, on the drivers side, just to the outside
of the headlight, there is a locking mechanism.  It is a simple key hole
that looks like it fits a smaller key, like a locking gas cap key.  When I
pull the front panel inside, the back of this lock looks like it has four
places to attach wiring, but there are no wires attached.  What could this
be?  Is is a primitive security system of some kind, maybe a battery
disconnect?  It really isn't all that important, but my curiosity is running
wild with this.  I am just imagining really cool James Bond type gadgets
popping up all over the bus if I actually got the key for this thing (hey, I
can dram, right?)

Thanks,

Daniel Cathey III
