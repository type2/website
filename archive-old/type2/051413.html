Subject: [T2] Bus Sighting

Saw a bus yesterday.  Had a grill like a vanagon, but this wasn't like any
vanagon I'd ever seen before.  I dunno, maybe more boxy than a vanagon, if
that makes any sense.  Had a very low riding pop top, had all of the RV
fixture type stuff on driver's side. (Left side for you in GB)   Looked kind
of odd, everything on the bus was white, except for the black grill.  Met it
on the fly, but was on a two lane rd, and we both were travelling under 40.
Had to have been brand new, or freshly repainted, this thing was WHITE.

                                                                Frank
