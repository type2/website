Subject: Thermostat

I don't believe the thermostat is working correctly on my '77 westy (2L FI
engine).  The little acordian thing is expanded its maximum amount all of the
time I believe (about 46 mm as in Bently).  When I put my engine back together
I connected the thermostat cable fairly tightly.  Could It be that I pulled the
thermostat out to its expanded state and locked it that way with the flaps
closed?  This would not allow the flaps to open.  Maybe the thermostat is
just dead?
Can I disconnect the themostat and replace it without removing much of the
engine and without much hassle?  

Also I may be missing two pieces of Cooling tin.  Bently show two pieces labled
Bottom left air duct and bottom right air duct on page 20 of the Engine and
clutch section or the manual for the 68-79 bus.  It appears that these
pieces may go below the heads and connects to the right and left front
air ducts, respectively.  I don't think I am confusing these pieces with
the tin that goes under the head above the push rod tubes.  I added these.
I have not seen this tin listed in the &quot;How to rebuild your air cooled VW
so does anyone know what I am talking about?  I believe that this tin would
obscure the view of the bottom of the heads and push rod tubes that are
now plainly visable on my bus.

Please help with both questions, I just rebuilt this thing and I want it 
to last a while.
thanks,
Brett
