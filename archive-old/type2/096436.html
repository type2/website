Subject: megasquirt/fi non fi user skip it!

Chris,

I have been on the MS list since about March, and yes, the folks there are
prettty serious about people reading the old archives.(RTFM).

I have a MSCS and have put electronic kits together since I was about 8, 
so it's not such a serious thing for me.  Yes, it will take some 
concentration to get it put together, but I don't think much more than a 
newbie rebuilding a t4 engine.

It's *not* going to be for everyone until someone does it on a t4 and 
tells the world.

My push for it is that I *want* the power provided by my t4 engine with 
the cam in it that says &quot;not recomended for FI&quot;...so I *can* be a power 
junkie too!&lt;grin&gt;

There *is* a guy on the list that is running megasquirt on his t4 engined 
bus!...maybe not well yet, but he is running.

My other push is to get rid of lots of parts off of my stock fi system.

No more resistor packs
No more afm
No more double relay
No more cold start injector

Uses stock head temp sensor
Uses stock injectors and intake manifolds
Uses stock throttle body

You can tune it with a laptop.
The code to do this is available on the net and free!

A lot of those guys on that list are doing really weird stuff that equates 
to drag racing and that is why they are building the fancy fuel rails and 
throttle body setups.  The ones that are in to this sort of thing say that
when they switched from afm type stuff to MS, the difference was just 
incredible!

Makes me wonder....$$$$$$$$ for fancy carbs or $150 for megasquirt.
IF those folks are going to megasquirt instead of carbs, whats' up with 
that!!

Chris, what you are doing with the Corvair stuff is somewhat beyond me!  I 
don't have a machine shop so it seems difficult....guess it's just what 
you *know* and are used to.

BTW, I quit doing vw stuff for a while(15yrs) cause I thought the 
stock fi was too complicated!  If I can take a 78 stock fi bus that has
sat for 8 years and follow the Bentley on the test procedure for fi and 
get it running, I figure anything is possible!!

And, I will let you all know how it works out!

Cheers, dave

&lt;some snipped for the quote nazis&gt;&gt;

&gt; First - I'm not telling you are stupid for considering Megasquirt. It works.
&gt; 
&gt; Second - I don't know what your personal electronics abilities are. You may 
&gt; be an electronics engineer. This isn't a flamejob that I am tossing at you.
&gt; 
&gt; Third - I figure you are like the rest of us, good under the hood, always 
&gt; eager to try something new and more power is a good thing.
&gt; 
&gt; However - there are alot of folks here that are brand new to tinkering. I 
&gt; don't know where you fit in the lineup so don't get your feelings hurt by 
&gt; my message. If you can get do this than teach me how too.  I just don't 
&gt; know if you know what you are in for with the Megasquirt system.
&gt; 
&gt; Subscribe to their list and see if you know what they are talking about. I 
&gt; warn you many of those folks don't tolerate stupid questions because they 
&gt; are working on &quot;heavy&quot; stuff. There really should be a beginner's list for 
&gt; Megasquirt. I joined, lurked, and watched a newbie jump out there and get 
&gt; hammered and so I lurked some more. I never could quite understand the 
&gt; whole picture so I unsubscribed.
&gt; 
&gt; Megasquirt as I understand it relies on mainly domestic sensors and fuel 
&gt; injection parts. In most - if not all - of the pics I've seen they have 
&gt; been using GM injection parts. MAP sensors, injectors, some of the 
&gt; ignition, whatever. The pics all look like GM. They also have a list called 
&gt; Megajolt where they are designing custom programmed ignition systems too.
&gt; 
&gt; I too have been giving the Megasquirt concept a critical eye and for many 
&gt; months subscribed to their list. The list is VERY technical with discussion 
&gt; of things I don't even have the slightest understanding about and I fancy 
&gt; myself to be a competent mechanic that can learn alot when I have too.
&gt; 
&gt; The brain box is alot of work - you have to assemble it and then program 
&gt; it. Of course you also have to adapt the fuel injection components to the 
&gt; VW engine as well. No small task.
&gt; 
&gt; The brain box is about $100-$150 each but then you have to have another 
&gt; couple hundred $$$ of parts to make it work and if you have to farm any of 
&gt; it out (like MIG welding bungs into a revised intake manifold) expect the 
&gt; money to climb quickly.
&gt; 
&gt; That buys alot of spare OEM VW brain boxes at swap meets. I have a couple 
&gt; stuck back.
&gt; 
&lt;snip&gt;&gt; 
&gt; For example I am still working towards a 110 HP Corvair transplant. More 
&gt; power, more torque, slightly more mpg. Like the Type IV it is a robust 
&gt; engine that lasts along time is treated right. A 110 HP engine is worth 
&gt; between 95 and 100 HP on modern gas and with modern HP ratings. It's a very 
&gt; good start. Much better than 67 Hamster Power. Will enable me to run a 
&gt; modern highway speeds - ~70 mph.
&gt; 
&gt; I am just starting the cleaning and refurbishing process of the engine. I 
&gt; do want fuel injection and have spoken and read quite a bit about adapting 
&gt; modern GM fuel injection systems from the very common 3.1 liter V-6 to the 
&gt; Corvair 2.7 liter. That is a modern multi-port system and should cost me a 
&gt; few hundred dollars but it will run right out of the box as it were right 
&gt; after I get home from the junkyard (riiiiight!).
&gt; 
&gt; Another popular time intensive project is adapting 2.0 Type IV pistons and 
&gt; cylinders to the Corvair to take the displacement to 3.1 liters. Requires 
&gt; some internal clearancing.
&gt; 
&gt; So my point is learn to fix what you've got (which isn't that bad nor that 
&gt; hard to repair even if the brain is cooked if you can build a Megasquirt 
&gt; system), or consider an existing junkyard fuel injection system.
&gt; 
&gt; Megasquirt doesn't guarantee you results - it does guarantee you the 
&gt; opportunity to tune a fuel injection system to your needs. If your needs 
&gt; are ordinary then an ordinary fuel injection system will do the job - 
&gt; vintage or modern. If your needs are extraordinary (racing, turbo, 8000 
&gt; rpm, etc.) or you really want to take the plunge then Megasquirt is for you.
&gt; 
&gt; If you go after building a Megasquirt then please keep us updated! Sounds 
&gt; like a really cool project and I would love to hear about the results.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember I am assuming that your abilities are average and you haven't got 
&gt; any experience with programming chips or building circuits. If I am wrong 
&gt; then I'm wrong. If I'm right - take the time to read their list for a 
&gt; while. When I first started reading the list I was ready and willing to 
&gt; send the money away right away for my kit....
&gt; 
&gt; On a side note I got to look over a CB Performance turbo kit the other 
&gt; afternoon. Neat setup. The fuel injection is standard GM though with a 
&gt; custom brain box (driver adjustable). Was strange to see the sensors 
&gt; without any serial numbers on them - guess that sends you back to them when 
&gt; you need a new MAP sensor or a new injector vs. a trip to the local FLAPS.
&gt; 
&gt; See ya.
