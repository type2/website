Subject: new family member

just received another member of my family on saturday. She is a blue 72 bus 
w/out a engine and trans. But hey the price was fair. I traded my 64 bug for 
it. The body is in ok shape for being a wisconsin bus. She came from green 
bay. It has some rust in the rockers which is normal. sliding door track is 
soild which is good sliding door will not be falling off like my first bus 
did.

 I feel just like Isaiah we will both be into Volkswagen for ever. The 72 bus 
is my 5th Volkswagen that i have owned. It is really nice to have a guy that 
lives close by and is the same age as you (18). Nothing wrong with older 
people though. Just like everyone else says I have learned so much from the 
people on this list.

I guess the main reason i posted this to the list is i am in need of parts 
for my new bus. Parts i need are:

engine hangers
engine 
trans
both axles
interior door panels

I will most likely have a longer list when i get more into this project but 
these are the parts i know at this time i am in need of.
another question i was offered a trans from a 79 bus will this trans work 
just fine in this bus. The same guy has a 1700 73 or 74 he beleives engine is 
now a 2.0 but anyways is the input shaft on the trans the right length? Also 
when ordering a clutch cable if i do get this trans would i order a 79 cable? 
I got many new cables with this bus such as clutch cable, heater cables left 
and right, and acclerator cables all for 72 only i beleive. Any help/parts 
anyone can give me would be great.
