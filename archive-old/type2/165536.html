&gt; Do the math twice, not the adjustment. Don't try to adjust the springs on
&gt; anything but a flat surface.

I will second this, but the _really_ important thing is that the bus be
perfectly level front-to-rear while adjusting.  With the entire bus on
jack stands, put a good carpenter's level on the floor of the bus just
inside the sliding door and adjust the stands to level the floor.  Some
squares of 1/8 masonite or plywood large enough to put under the jack
stands are helpful in making fine adjustments.
