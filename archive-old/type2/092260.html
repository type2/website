Yep,  I've got an EMPI on mine.  Pull up on a little ring and easy it
into reverse.  Cost about $99.00 at most ACVW FLAPS or on line sellers. 
Looks better than the wimpy little stick that comes standard.

It is a bit taller and if you are in first, it interferes with the
parking brake.

&gt; 1) Is there such a thing as a 'trigger' for reverse available for my 1978 Bus? (On my 1973 VW Beetle, I had a EMPI or Hurst; [I forget] stick shift; it had a trigger for reverse that made going into that gear so much easier)...
