You should be able to run it for about as long as a shrouded engine takes
to &quot;warm up&quot;.  Probably a minute or so.

&gt; The motor was stripped of it tin, fan housing, intake, exhaust and 
&gt; tinware. We want to test it and have a bell housing and a starter to 
&gt; bolt it to. We can score an intake manifold, carb and exhaust. We are 
&gt; considering trying to run it for a short period without the tin in 
&gt; place while on the stand. Can this be done safely and if so for how 
&gt; long? Seconds or minutes?
