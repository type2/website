Subject: [T2] a BIG thank you

HI Volks,
   Last weekend my wife Kathy and I went to Campers on Cape Cod and 
Transporterfest 2000.  Had a great time at both and want to thank those of 
you who had a part in organizing those events.  As usual there was a varied 
group of people all enjoying what we have in common, VW buses!
