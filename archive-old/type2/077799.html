stay away from GEX

if your shop is as good as you say, you could rebuild it yourself with the

&gt; I have a 78 Westy that I bought in the fall of 1977.  
&gt; 
&gt; My question is: what is the quality of these engines, or would it be worth
 &gt; 
&gt;  So, to summarize... I am looking for reports from satisfied customers
&gt; who have bought a rebuilt engine from some company. I would also
&gt; appreciate any reports from unsatisfied customers, as well.
