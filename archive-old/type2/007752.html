Subject: Re: [Re: First year for buses with air-conditioning??]
Mime-Version: 1.0

i have seen dealer a/c on busses as far back as 65' or so. i recall that there is a pic of split window bus on the samba_dot_com w/ factory air.

split window bus a/c is not particulary attractive imho. the unit sits  on the top of the back of the bus..

would thin that a/c would be quite a drain on an already hp challenged engine
