&gt;
&gt;options:
&gt;1- remark dipstick and hope it is  accurate...
&gt;2- get sump plate i removed drilled for VDO sender
&gt;3- buy predrilled sump plate like i had.
&gt;
&gt;#2 or #3 is what i wanna do.

You forgot #4 - cut an inch or so off the bottom of the dipstick.  It's
fast, easy, CHEAP, and it works.  You will notice that the dipstick is
plenty long to cut an inch off and still give proper high and low readings.
 I had the same problem when I went to the VDO sender and this is how I
solved it.  Don't worry, your dipstick will be accurate after you do this.
The dipstick is just hitting the sender - 914's had the dipstick in a
different spot so this was not a problem with them.

Notice the &quot;dipstick is hitting the sender&quot; line?  This is one of my pet
peeves.  Dipstick oil temperature senders will give the same readings as
sump plate oil temperature senders.  Why?  Because they are in the same
spot!  &quot;Dipstick hits sender&quot;.  It's true!

p.s. I've posted this information before - a check of the archives under
&quot;dipstick&quot;, &quot;sump plate&quot;, or something similar would probably have pulled
it up.
