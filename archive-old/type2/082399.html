Subject: engine removal (again)


With all this talk of engine &amp; tranny removal, I've decided to
remove them both together the next time (relatively soon.)  I
assume this will change the center of gravity and thus jack
placement, correct?  How much should I adjust for?  Also, any and all
tips on what else to disconnect are appreciated, never removed
my tranny before.

Thanks,

Rob
