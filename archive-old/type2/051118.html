I've been looking at a '72 Westy.  The dude has a drive-away tent in good
shape, but he is asking $600 extra for it.  Is this too much or about right?

Also- I've been trying to find a newer-model tent for the Westy, a modern
side tent or van tent.  I have yet to find anything other than the awnings
on gowesty_dot_com.  Any ideas???

Thanks,
Wade
