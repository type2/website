Hi all, just a line to say that our son Cameron was born today
the 24th of June _at_ 11:04am weighing 7.5lbs, After 30 hours
of labour. Unfortunatly he was not breathing for himself, so
has been put in intensive care, but we hope he will be OK in
a week or so. Denise lost a lot of blood (2 pints) &amp; is in a
poor way, but recovering.
