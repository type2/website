&gt;We want suggestions as to how much he should charge me
&gt;for the heads. Any input would be helpful, as neither
&gt;of us know what a pretty good used set of heads run
&gt;for these days. Please help us out....

If they are matched, uncut heads with no cracks, I would think somewhere in 
the $100 to $250 range would be fair.  Are the valve guides worn?  How many 
miles on the heads since the last rebuild?  Have the seats been modified to 
prevent dropping?  The answers could help pinpoint the price.
