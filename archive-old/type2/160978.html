Too bad the US is so stupid when it comes to diesel fuel.

&gt; Since 1983, manufacturers have paid more than $590 million in CAFE  
&gt; civil penalties. Most European
&gt; manufacturers regularly pay CAFE civil penalties ranging from less  
&gt; than $1 million to more than $20 million
&gt; annually. Asian and most of the big domestic manufacturers have  
&gt; never paid a civil penalty.

And how much does Ford pay on the million or so F-150s made each  
year? We all know the answer to that one.
