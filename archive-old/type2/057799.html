The crossover pipe for the '79 to '83 is available again, for $279 (which is
high, but beats the last dealer price of $600!!!).  It is now a single
piece, which goes from the heat exchangers to the cat.  The cat, muffler,
and tailpipe are all available fairly reasonably, so the most expensive part
is that crossover pipe.

Well, how much would the whole ball of wax be from heater box to tailpipe for
the 79 to 81 version?
