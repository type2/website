Subject: Revenge from the Slow Lane

Splitters:

Life in the split lane (read slow) has its share of pleasures but
also an occasional PITA when some jerk tails or passes too close.
Who hasn't imagined a bit of revenge aimed at the muscle-car,
engine-too-big-for-his-own-good type of driver.  We've written of
clouds of smoke and bumper stickers, and someone was listening.

What high-tech gadget does the in-your-face, on-your-bumper, kind
of driver buy to keep his/her bad habits off of his permanent
record?  The fuzz buster.  That marvel of widgets and gizzmos
designed to allow for juvenile behavior behind the wheel without
annoying ramifications from the local constabulary.

Browsing through a mail order catalog this morning I found some
soft and safe revenge.  Wouldn't you like to send him/her a
message from your flat-four, it *is* on the floor, split window
karmamobile?  Just tune into his/her frequency and speak a
language he/she understands.  Advertised in the catalog is a
handy little pseudofuzz radar transmitter, guaranteed to make
his/her fuzz buster &quot;Scream like a Banshee.&quot;

Yes!  No muss, no fuss, nothing illegal, a little bit of help for
our smokey friends who are busy searching for pot somewhere when
you really need them.  And the side benefit is that when you are
the target of an over-zealous search-and-destroy mission in your
bus, you can point to the transmitter as your law-abiding effort
to assist in the effort to reduce traffic perps!

At $70, it's a bit much, but an appealing idea.
