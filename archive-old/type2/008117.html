(This is my second post to the list - new bus owner :).

I just got a '76 Westy ('Deluxe' says the for sale sign in the window, but
I'm not really sure how to determine if it really is or not).  It's got the
factory installed air conditioner underneath the dash.  I'm wondering how it
works.  It looks like there's a radiator of some sort underneath the front,
behind the belly pan and in front of the beam.  I'd assume that it's part of
the AC.  I thought there was supposed to be a compressor belted to the
crankshaft, but there's no such thing in the engine compartment.  There are
two suspicious-looking fat hoses back there, though.  It looks like they
were cut off of whatever they connected to (they might be vapor recovery
hoses or somesuch, too - the engine compartment's a mess right at the
moment).

I'm wondering:  If there is supposed to be a compressor back there, and if
it's not there, is it worth finding one and installing it, or should I just
remove the AC?  That is, would it be more trouble to remove all the other
components or replace the compressor (and whatever other parts might be
missing...  eek.)  I mean, it'd be nice to have AC in the summer, but I've
never needed it before...

Also, there's a little insulated icebox (or) fridge type thing just to the
left of the rear seat, and there's an additional radiator/cooler type thing
beneath the cargo bay.  Can I assume that _that_ cooler is for the fridge,
and I therefore have a fridge, or is it an icebox and is the cooler for
something else?  (There's a 110AC male plug on the outside left of the van,
underneath a grey flip-up cover, which would cause me to believe that it's a
fridge, but then, the icebox/fridge thing opens from the top (not the front
like the Vanagon fridge) too, so I don't know...)

Additional tidbits, since it's friday:

I'm really happy about this bus - it's a westy with all sorts of cool
camper-like stuff, a fairly good body, it was cheap, and the engine is in
serious pain (it produces copious quantities of smoke from all around, leaks
oil everywhere, and makes the &quot;someone adjusted my valves without turning
the crankshaft&quot; sorts of noises).  Since I want a really reliable engine
(that's a known quantity, for once) I'll be doing my first rebuild in the
next few months, so I'm sure I'll have lots of questions.  :)

Getting it to my parents' house was interesting - the pushrod that connects
the accelerator pedal to that bracket that the cable goes into was missing,
so I had to, um, &quot;fabricate&quot; one from a tent stake I found underneath the
rear seat and some packing tape that had helpfully been left in the sink. 
It runs pretty well, considering the condition it's in.  I think it even
uses all 4 cylinders.  The windshield was so dirty that I had to drive it to
the gas station (keepers of the Squegee) with my head out the window.  Since
I'd driven a bus exactly once before, all I can say is that it's weird
sitting on the front wheels.
