&gt; What's in the EGR filter?

Mine was completely empty, except for rusty fragments. I believe new ones 
are full of steel wool or some such.

&gt; Does it filter carbon or is it full of carbon?

It filters carbon, i.e. soot, form the exhaust stream that is heading 
back to the intake manifold. And doesn't do a real good job of this as 
far as I can see, since the owner's manual calls for inspection and or 
replacement every 20K miles. These things crud up all the time.

Like I said, it's full of steel wool. Charcoal filters generally filter 
organic compounds. That is not the purpose of this device.

&gt; What's it for?

The whole system is supposed to reduce the combustion temperature in the 
cylinders, which makes for lower production of NOx emissions. It may 
actually accomplish this, but up 'til now no smog stations have been 
measuring NOx directly, so who knows? They just inspect that the system 
is functioning and call it good. But I understand new and more stringent 
smog tests may be in the offing? Many folks disconnect these systems 
between smog tests. VW didn't stay with these for too many years, so I 
don't suppose it worked that well.
