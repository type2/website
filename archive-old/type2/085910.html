Subject: RE: [T2] Engine won't start - ideas?

	If it's not compression, it's construction.  Perhaps a valve is closed, 
physically preventing you from turning the motor over(longshot).  Or perhaps 
there's fluid(fuel) in the cylinders?  Using the starter to turn the engine 
over, are the plugs removed?  Or are you removing them and then attempting 
to turn it over by hand?
