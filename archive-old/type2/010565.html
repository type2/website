Hello everyone,

I've been working on my '77 Westy lately trying eliminate the exhaust noise. 
  I noticed that two of my exhaust port studs had broken off. Bad news. I 
then managed to break off a third one while removing the exhaust system. 
More bad news.

I attepted the much lauded technique of &quot;torch and parafin&quot; of getting them 
out to no avail.  To cut this story down some and save some language, I 
ended up welding nuts to the portion of the studs that, thankfully, were 
still long enough to do so.  I then was able to remove them.  I don't know 
who else has used this technique but it saved my butt.

The point of this story, and there is one,  is that you can't just order up 
some replacement exhaust port studs and expect to finish the job. For some 
odd reason the studs are not the same diameter on both ends like earlier bug 
and bus studs. They are longer and are 9 mm on the end that goes into the 
head and 8 mm for the nut and are just over 55 mm long. (They are not the 
same as the oversize studs either, they are 10mm on one side and 8mm on the 
other, and too darn short anyway). I called all around to try and find 
replacements and could only get them from an official VW dealership.  They 
are a normal stock item.  So heres the nugget of this here tale: the VW 
number for such a stud is: N 014 684 1
And the cost? just over 6 bucks a piece! ouch. Having found them, I'll 
gladly pay it so I can get my Westy on the road before the weather gets too 
cold!

Take care, hope that saves someone else the confusion and headache I 
endured.  I can't believe Rock Mountain and other places like them don't 
carry them! Surely I'm not the only poor slob out here with busted studs!
