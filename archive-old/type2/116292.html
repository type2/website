Subject: Toyota Bus??

Hey guys,

	Now that I own a Bus.. I've been noticing other Volkswagens, etc.
I've only ever seen 3 other bays in the past 4 months since I've owned the
Bus. In any case, I've started noticing these Toyotas that look very close
to what a Vanagon looks like. Anyone know what I'm talking about? I don't
think I've ever seen a copy-cat car more than this in my entire life. They
EVEN tried to make it look like the engine was in the back (it isn't is
it?). They have the sliding windows on the side doors.. they even have a
grill that LOOKS like a Vanagon in the front. Every time I see one, I first
think it's a Vanagon and then realize it's a Toyota.
