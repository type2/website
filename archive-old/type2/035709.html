Subject: Status of list pics(thnx!)

Hi ALL,
    Round-a-bout bus content..............
        Thanks for sending me all the pics and links (I know theres more!!!
Weve got over 900 members and about 30 something pics!!!) If youve sent me a
pic or a link to your pic and its not up, Im having trouble with the
formatt. Either my system is saying its not a valid image file or it just
wont open at all after I post it? Any ideas?(all are already jpeg. or lifted
right from a site in jpg. formatt?) Well thats what Ill be doing today.
        Also after I gather as many as I can I think it would also be neat
(gee whiz!!) to find out at least what state we all live in(or country) pic
or no pic. It would be a good idea for new clubs to start and carabus to
local shows. (has this already been done yet?)Lemme know what ya think and
again THANKS FOR THE PICS! keep em
coming wether you have a web page or not and If you dont like the pic I
chose of your bus or want your current pic removed lemme know.
Take care all!!
Steve
