Subject: Gen, Accel cable yadda yadda..

What an afternoon.
Broke my accel cable the other day at work and wired it up temp meanwhile 
the gen light had been on a couple days and I had some issues still rith 
a carb i had swapped in....
So this afternoon I decide to start dealing w all.
First the red light. I had already tried swapping brushed and stuck a 
meter there and it wasn't charging. So I removed the connections and 
tested the open ckt voltage. surprise it works bad regulator so off to 
the local FLAPS and 20$ for  wells regulator (oh well) wired in and 
fixed  OK cool I was expecting that to be more trouble.
Get my accel cable greased and ready to go in and pull the broken one and 
hmmm it gets stuck about 6&quot; from the end of the tube. Well i feed the 
broken cable through and even a fish tape to see what the obstruction is 
never figure it out and try to shove the cable in again and no go. I get 
the idea that i can pull it through with the old wire so i crimp it over 
and loop it and of course it gets stuck which I expect so i get the end 
of the old wire and pull pull PULL its is hopelessly tight and then 
breaks off and when i try to pull the replacement cable back it breaks 
off as well. I finally ended up cutting about 8-12&quot; of the accel tube to 
get the bad spot. Im figuring I can just put a longish piece of fuel line 
or something similar to take up the spot from the now cut off tube to where 
the 
old missing bowden tube would have ended. once i clear the remnant of bad 
tube thats left that is. Lastly I fixed a disfunctional cutoff solenoid 
(old style from 30-1) The brass fitting screws off the front and inside a 
cruddy plunger and spring so sandpaper and cleaning it seems fine now.
DOH!
