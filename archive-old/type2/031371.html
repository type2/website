&gt; off?...lots of mice excrement and a mouse franticly trying to escape the 
&gt; engine compartment when I started it last.

check out your heat ducts especially the cooling exhaust ducts near the
muffler and exhaust manifold.  the mice build a nest in there and it can
get hot enough to catch fire..... (as me how I know!!!)
