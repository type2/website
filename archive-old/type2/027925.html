after sending out my last message i had a good meal and went back outside to 
do some more tinkering.  the first and only thing i did was check out temp 
sensor #2.  the connection was a little loose so i tightened it up and what 
do you know?  the engine ran smooth for the first time ever, the smoke 
pretty much cleared up, and the gas smell wasn't as strong.  plus i could 
actually adjust the idle with the screw.

but silly me, i had to take her for spin around the block.  how could you 
blame me?  after about two blocks everything was ok, although there wasn't 
much power.  after taking a right turn at a light the engine bogged down and 
felt like it was running on 2 cylinders or something, and i had it in second 
and was just sputtering along wondering what the hell was going on.  then 
this big backfire type bang happened, and i pulled over to the side of the 
road as the engine stalled.  all efforts to revive the engine after that 
were useless.
she won't start.  what the hell happened?  there was a nice little puddle of 
what appeared to be gas under the right hand side of the engine compartment, 
although it could have been oil too since my oil is really gassy.  the only 
problem is, i don't see where it is leaking from, or why it is happening, or 
if it has anything to do with the fact the the engine is all screwed 
up......

i am going insane.....

mark, '78 bus.
