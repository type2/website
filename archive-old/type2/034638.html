No, no.  this was an early 75, pre bulkhead removal and tranny change.
idlentical tranny as the 74, 73.  Same starter as erlier busses, bugs, etc
etc.  How do i know?:)  the bus sits in my moms back yard...

Same input shaft length.  Hell, you can actually use the bellhousing as
is, uf you use a late clutch..oh. i think i pulled the t/o fork though,
didnt i ken?  put the early bellhousing on, and use the old style clutch.


later...david
