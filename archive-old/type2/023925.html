HEy everbody,

Yeah I can;t thank you guys enough for helping me out with the starter
fluid.... the thing was I was out there last night trying to see what was
up... I cranked the engine and puropsely tried to flood the engine to see if
the pump was stuck.... sure enough, I oculdn't smell any gas coming from my
engine so I looked under the car to see where the pump was and I found both of
my wires unplugged with a little note on it that read &quot;Gotcha&quot; 
Weird man.....
Thanks again guys/gals for all your help... next time I have a problem I'll
try to give as much info as possible.... cheers!

Respectfully yours,
