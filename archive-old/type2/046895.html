&lt;&lt; For more than 4 years, I have been trying to elicit information from other 
VW Type 2 owners, about the nature and extent of problems with exhaust heat 
exchangers, from Dansk Autopart and other manufactures. It is my intention, 
to present this damning evidence to them, in order to try to pursuade them, 
to do something about these faults, so please send me as much information as 
possible. &gt;&gt;

My experience is that you need to replace both exchangers at the same time.  
The new exchangers are different than the old ones.  The exhaust ports are 
about 1/2&quot; higher, and if you only replace one side, your muffler won't match 
up.  Other than the exhaust ports, I have no other problems with the 
exchangers.  Of course, I may have a set from a different batch.
