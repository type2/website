Subject: soft brakes: at wit's end :(

Chronology:

Right Rear wheel hot, suspect emergency brake cable stuck.
Lift vehicle, wiggle, pull on cable. Brake finally loosens, not sure why,
though. Could be wiggling, could be time, or the moon's gravitational pull,
dunno.
Pull drum, but break (as in &quot;destroy) wheel cylinder (WC) in the process. :(
Check emergency brake cable movement: seems fine.
Buy new pair of WCs, new shoes, new hardware.
Replace WC, shoes, and hardware on RR. Bleed brake fluid. Pretty dark.
Adjust stars.

Soft, spongy brake pedal! Basically goes to the floor.
Rebleed, still not improvement.
Decide MC got bled to death. Replace MC. Problem persists.
Buy and use &quot;power&quot; bleeder, the kind that's powered by 30psi tire pressure.
Still no improvement.
Replace RR brake hose. Only marginal improvement.

Note: Pedal is firm when system is pressurized by &quot;power&quot; bleeder.

Help! :)

Sami
