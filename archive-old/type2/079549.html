Subject: advice?

Hello there~  

I have a 1972 Westy.  So, my problem:  This past August I was changing the oil and I decided (unfortunately) to clean the oil screen.  But when I tightened the bolt under the oil screen I (actually, my boyfriend) tightened it too far and we heard a loud sound...  so I read the John Muir book and it said that we probably destroyed the camshaft.  Anyway the engine developed an oil leak on the left side and the oil light began to flash on and off.  Basically, I figured that destroying the camshaft cracked my engine block.  =(

The engine was in pretty good shape before this...the guy (Vanagain in Millville, NJ--they're awesome!) who replaced the rear engine seal recently said that it looked like it had been rebuilt in the past.  

Another mechanic (he's not a VW mechanic...just a foreign car mechanic) I talked to said he can fix my bus &quot;on the side&quot; by getting a used engine block at a junk yard and taking my engine apart and putting the parts of my engine back into this new block.  My question for you all is this:  Is it just that simple?  Will the parts inside my engine fit properly in a different block?  Or would you recommend getting a totally different engine?  If so, where can I find a used engine, and how do I know if it's ok?  

I am a college student and I am on an EXTREMELY tight budjet.  =)  The bus is sitting in my grandmother's yard right now back in southern New Jersey, and I want to get the bus fixed within the next couple of months so I can drive it back to school (in Iowa) after Christmas break.

Please, if anybody has any good advice for me let me hear it!  Basically I need to know what I can do to fix this engine and have it run while spending the least amount of money possible.  =)  Advice please!!!

Hugs,
*~Suzanna~*
