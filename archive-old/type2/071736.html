&gt; The unit is made by Gunson in Britain and is much higher in quality than
&gt;  the usual run of Whitney stuff (metal case, not plastic, etc.)  Anyone
&gt;  have a general opinion of the quality to be expected from Gunson?  They
&gt;  are new to me, but might be rather better known across the pond :-)

I've got various 'tools' by gunson - things I'm not using all the time like a 
brake bleeding kit, timing light, rev/dwell counter. 

They market to the home mechanic rather than to garages so its not industrial 
stength stuff; but I've no complaints about quality of build and they always 
work when I want to use them (so far...).

They come with adequate instructions on how to use them too.

Good luck
