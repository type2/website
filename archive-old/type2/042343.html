Howdy All,
On friday I plan to attempt to start my '77 bus that has been setting unloved and unnattended for a year and a half. It's got a seventy-something pankake 1700. I'm putting the alternator back in, replacing and clamping the fuel hose and trying to see if the old holley-weber type carb can get it going. Any suggestions or warnings or encouragement will be gladly accepted.
Thanks in advance,

Jeff
