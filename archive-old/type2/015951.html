Volks,

I just got back from the chassis dyno.  Made 5 pulls which I will describe
in a second.  One of the pulls was with the A/C on so if you want to know
how much horsepower A/C takes, read this!  The differences from last time
are as follows:

Pulled 55k mile GEX heads (&quot;1800&quot; heads with 41mm intake valves, 52cc
chambers, unported) and replaced with rebuilt Mark Stephens heads (&quot;1700&quot;
heads with 39.5(?) intake valves, combustion chambers unshrouded and
polished then milled to 48cc).  Also replaced 28.5mm venturis with the
stock 26mm venturis, and replaced the 145 main jets with 137.5's.  Air
correction jets and idle jets stayed the same at 155 and 55 respectively.
Old peak hp was 56, new peak hp is 60, an approximately 7% gain.  Not as
much as I was hoping for, but noticeable nonetheless.

Pull #1 was with timing set to 4 BTDC (dual diaphragm distributor with both
hoses hooked up).  HP was 59, torque 89.

Pull #2 was the same except that I pulled the black plastic covers off of
the tops of the carbs.  Horsepower and torque were both down significantly
and the curve was very rough.  Last time I was at the dyno the same thing
happened and I thought it was simply running lean from the extra air.  This
time I put in the richest jets I had so it would not go lean and it still
runs badly with the covers off.  From this I conclude that it is an issue
of the airflow pattern going into the carbs.  Must not be smooth without
the covers.  Once again, it seems the VW engineers did their homework, and
even though the covers look restrictive they are necessary to smooth the
airflow into the carbs for good horsepower.

Pull #3 was with the covers back on and the A/C running.  Compared to pull
#1 I lost between 1.5 and 2 horsepower throughout the rev range.  Usually
closer to 1.5 horsepower.  Now you know.  :)  This is with the Sankyo
rotary compressor driven from the air pump drive pulley.  Peak hp on this
run was 57 and peak torque was 86.5.  

Pull #4 was with the timing retarded to 0 degrees (A/C back off).  I gained
1 horsepower and 1 lb/ft of torque over pull #1.  This was the best run of
the day, with peak numbers of 59.9hp at 4100 rpm and 89.8 lb/ft at 2900 rpm.

Pull #5 was with the timing retarded still farther to 4 degrees ATDC.  At
this setting I lost a little torque below 3500rpm but it was about the same
&gt;from there on up (went up to 5400 rpm).  Peak numbers were 59.8 hp and 88.3
torque.  I reset the timing back to 0 degrees and called it a day.

So, after all that work I gained a whopping 4 rear-wheel horsepower.
Doesn't sound like much, but I can feel the difference, and it's a nice
feeling.  The engine doesn't seem to be running significantly hotter with
the slightly higher compression, but I did hear a tiny bit of pinging once
when it was hot and the timing was at 4 BTDC.  Hopefully I won't hear it
anymore with the timing at 0 degrees.  The MSHP heads are nice but I don't
think their claims of being able to run higher compression with no
detonation are justified, at least not in my situation.  The old heads
never ever pinged, no matter how bad the gas or how much timing or how hot
the motor was.  I will just have to be a little more careful now... and
maybe I will drop the compression back next time the engine comes out.
Hope this all was as interesting to the rest of you as it was to me.
