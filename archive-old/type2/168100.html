&quot;I am in  significant need of a 4 speed transmission for a 1982 diesel 
vanagon.
The  candidate will need to be in usable condition but does not need to  
include
the  bellhousing. The closer the candidate is the North  Carolina the better.

Thanks
Chris&quot;



Hey Chris
      The only one I know about is in an 82 diesel  we sold Robert in 
Highpoint (was veggie werks). the vanagon was used as a goat  house after the engine 
broke the timing belt so the transmission should be just  what your looking 
for. 
 
Sorry I don't know how to get a hold of him, but if you go to the business  
section on the full moon bus club site I believe theres a phone # an  address.
 
hope this helps
