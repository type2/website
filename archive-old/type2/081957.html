Subject: EB 2002 Observations

THANK YOU!!!!!!

My family operates a campground in Ohio, and after 30 years of growing up
there, I have seen darn near most everything.  However I HAVE NEVER seen
anything like EB2002.  I have never encountered a group as large as 300
people, and yet the quietest bunch you would ever meet.

Chris, and the whole bunch, fantastic job!

I hope nobody minds the shameless self promotion at the end.

I hope to see some of you at Buses and Boats in Cincinnati next month.
