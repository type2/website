&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;    My 71 bus came from the PO with a Bocar 30pict-1 carb installed on a 
&gt; 1600DP engine.  The Bentley manual calls for a Solex 34pict-3.  I have the 
&gt; chance to buy a 34pict-3 in rebuildable condition for a good price.
&gt;    My question is, will I have any real world differences by doing this carb 
&gt; change?  Of course the -3 would be rebuilt first.

Stock is the 34, but the 30 works fine for this engine.  You might pick up
a bit of additioanl power, but it might not be noticable.  If you are
running an 009 distributor, the 34 will probably have a &quot;flat spot&quot; tyjhat
can be very annoying.

Be sure that the 34 is truly rebuildable.  If the throttle shafts are
loose, then they will have to be rebushed before the carb can be used.
