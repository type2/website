Subject: Bus rentals?

Hi List;
   My foggy memory seems to recall that there was a place in
Albuquerque, New Mexico that rented Westy's. Anybody know the name/phone
number/web site of the place?
   Thinking of flying out there in April and my Westy will not be on the
road by then (too many projects, too little time.)
