Subject: Disc brake caliper piston retainers?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.3.95.991020124446.5747A-100000_at_supernet_dot_net&gt;

My replacement pads didn't come with these metal plates that are supposed
to hold the cutout in the pistons at the correct angle (nor were they
there on disassembly).  FLAPS never heard of them.

I know there was some discussion about these recently, but -- where do you
get them?

Thanks,
Joe
