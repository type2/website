Subject: Body and Paint help in SE PA

Hi Volks,

My '70 westy is having all the rust work done and is going to be ready
for body and paint work.  The original plan fell through for the paint.
Can anyone in S.E. PA recommend someone to do the work?  I want to get
the bus done for Everybus, plus its my daily driver now.  Any help would
be appreciated.

Thanks,
Jamie Auch
