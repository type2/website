Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 CAMPER 2.0L 



&gt; This is more an oberservation really . I have a HAYNES manual and the
&gt; IDIOT'S GUIDE for VWs . My fuel injection system does NOT have a Throttle
&gt; Vavle Switch ( just another name for a THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR ) .

Actually not the same thing, the throttle valve switch on an L-Jet system is
just a simple binary switch that signals the ECU when the driver has applied
full throttle so the mixture can be enriched.

A throttle position sensor more commonly refers to the device on D-Jet
systems which is a variable resistor based on throttle position.  The L-Jet
system has no such device.

Not all the VW Bus L-Jet applications have a throttle valve switch.  I can't
remember if my '79 does or not but I don't think it does.  It varies by
year.

&gt;Both
&gt; books list two types , one is under the Throttle and one is on top of the
&gt; Throttle . Mine has none of the above , it does NOT have a place to mount
it
&gt; , in other words it has no screw holes for one to even be mounted in
either
&gt; position . Also there is NO connection for a Throttle Vavle Switch to the
&gt; Control Unit . I guess my question is , is there a book that is not so
&gt; generalized ? Certainly my van is not the only one produced like this . Is
&gt; there a book that is more specific than these Haynes manuals . I have been
a
&gt; professional mechanic for 13 years , usually we get Chilton's Manuals ,
&gt; NEVER Haynes . But I can't seem to find one for my Van . Any help on GOOD
&gt; manuals would be appreciated , thanks .

The Chilton's manual for the Bus is pretty much toilet paper.  I've never
found Chiltons manuals to be any good.  The Haynes manual is pretty good but
the big daddy of the manuals is the Official Factory Repair Manual which is
put out by Bentley publishers.  Using that in conjunction with the Haynes is
what you need.
