&gt;&gt;That does it! I want a set for the '73!  BusBoys, are you listening?  or
&gt;&gt;must I get a machine shop to carve up a set off an old barn door? :-0

&gt;but barndoors don t have over riders, except of couse, on the ambulances.
&gt; these had front overriders to make it easier to pull the buses up hill, or
&gt;with horse or oxen

It must be a European thing. You're in dire need of medical care, they send
a 25 hp ambulance. That's okay, if the mountain gets too steep we can
always pull the ambulance with a mule because we have overriders. Thank
you. That's very reassuring. ;)
