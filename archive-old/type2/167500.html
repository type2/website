&gt; what oil weight?  what are the ambient temps outside in the mornings?
&gt; i may have missed previous emails,  is the engine stock?  without
&gt; knowing the oil in the engine and temps i don't know if this normal.
&gt; of course i'm still a novice.  during the winter last year w/ temps
&gt; near freezing i don't recall seeing pressure quite that high.  might
&gt; have been close though.  i was running mobil 1 15w50 syn.

I run mobil 1 15w50 syn in my 78 2liter engine bus all the time and I get
70psi or so at start up and never seems to fall below 35psi sitting still
after a run on a hot day. and this is an engine with 100k on it.
