    Hi Everyone.

   Just got home from a week long adventure around Lake Huron. The Bus =
performed well for us although we did run down the aux battery so low =
using the electric cooler and phone charger that it wouldn't start for =
us 2 mornings. I'll have to pull the main battery and check for a bad =
cell or low water. My aux and main connect when I turn the key so I =
think the drained aux sucked down the main when trying to start. Never =
had this prob till this trip. Had to push start . Thankfully there was a =
couple bikers from New Mexico across from us to help push!One of them =
even gave me his folding chair as he was tired of carrying it on his =
bike!
   We crossed to the States at Port Huron and spent the first night at =
the KOA in Gaylord MI. Nice clean campground with a heated pool that the =
kids loved. The next day we drove to Mackinaw City and caught the ferry =
over to the island. I had bought a bike rack before we left so we took =
the 4 bikes along with us. Glad we did as rentals were very expen$ive! =
The second night we camped at Mackinaw Millcreek campground. Very busy =
and full of 40' motor homes with air and sat dishes! Also noticed many =
pickups loaded with gear and guns! It's a wonder there is any wildlife =
left in northern MI!  The 3rd day we drove north to The Soo and crossed =
the border after getting cheap booze and smokes! We found our favorite =
campground here on an Indian reservation. Not many there and situated in =
a grove of 100 ' White pines.
We got a site on the St Marys river with a fabulous view. This =
campground is highly recommended for a relaxing vacation. This is where =
the battery first died on us. We had gotten up early to catch the train =
to Agawa Canyon and when the bus didn't start we were going to call a =
cab. My daughter said&quot;Why don't you just push the bus!&quot; Yaa!  Memory =
blank. I didn't even think of it! =20
   After spending another night here we traveled on to Sudbury to see =
Science North then on to Northbay for the night. Small campground in =
town on the lake.
Went to sleep with little on and awoke to 10 C!  Drove around my old =
college town to show the family then headed south to Perry Sound. This =
town was packed with tourists so we stopped at the bank then on to 6 =
mile lake Provincial park. Our neighbours were staying the week there so =
we camped beside them for the night.
On south to my parents house in Gorrie, quick shower and swapped =
vehicles with my dad and drove to TO  to see a play Friday night. Back =
to Gorrie to get the kids on Sat, spent a night at friends then home =
today. I have 153 e-mails to read then I'm going to bed.=20
