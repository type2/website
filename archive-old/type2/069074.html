Well, after nearly two hours of coaxing and swearing in the bitter cold..
she fired up.
I don't know what did it...

I pulled the air cleaner apart... found a little ice in the air cleaner.
Spray some WD-40 down in the carb throat(what they hAy...it always worked
for those nasty lawnmower engines)
Wrapped hot (okay...major warm... i didn't want to crack anything) towels
around the manifolds.

Removed everything... gave up.. cause it wouldn't start...

Went inside...
Threw the charger onto the battery...

Came back out fifteen minutes later... turned it and turned it and nothing...
But she seemed to have a little more life...

Okay so what about these choke heaters or something of that nature? I turned
the key on and left it in the on position for about 3 minutes... cranked the
engine... and she stumbled to a start... Woah...more than a putt...

Second time she fired right up and settled into a normal idle..? 

Is something wrong here? What can I do to prevent it in the future...?
Methyl hydrate a good solution? Is something out of whack with my carbs? She
accelerates fine... Idles fine... so what gives OBI WAN?
