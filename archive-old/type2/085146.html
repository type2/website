I suspect that given a budget of about $20,000, a very reliable bus could
be rebuilt. Start out with the leastest rustest specimen you can find. A
back-up car would make it very easy, as one could wait for the best deal
on replacement parts instead of piecing it together. i.e. Do the whole front
end instead of just ball joints.
Start a replacement fund instead of monthly payments...Another plus...
A bus can only appreciate at this point...Think of the rebuild as building
equity...
