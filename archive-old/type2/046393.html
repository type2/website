Subject: [T2] What does &quot;new&quot; mean? was new vs old

Volks,

I think the distinction here is not new vs old, but rather new vs NOS.  In
restoring older cars, there is a distinction between a part that is of
recent production and one that was produced at the same time the car was,
or at least produced by the company that originally produced the car.

For example, you can buy a perfectly functional heater box from any number
of vendors that is made today by Dansk.  At the same time, there are still
a couple heater boxes out there that were made by VW for use as
replacement parts and never installed.  Both the VW and Dansk boxes are
&quot;new&quot;, but the VW box would also be NOS - New Old Stock. There is a
premium on NOS parts for a variety of reasons.  Sometimes they are
perceived to be better, sometimes they *are* better, and in any event, if
you are restoring your bus to showroom condition, then they are the
*correct* part.

We have a variety of people on the list.  Many are concerned with keeping
their buses running, getting them past inspection, etc. etc.  Others are
concerned with having their bus as close as possible to showroom
condition, with all the original parts and accesories in place.  Both are
correct, both are fine, and if anyone wants to get into it on the list, be
warned... I will get &quot;annoyed&quot; :-)

BTW, &quot;NOS&quot; has a very specific and exact meaning!  An NOS part is:

1) NEW - The part was never installed on any vehicle.  The usual evidence
of this is the presence of the manufacturers tag or original packaging.  
If it was installed, however briefly, then it is a used part.  It may be
an excellent used part, but used it is and always will be. This is a
*very* &quot;buyer beware&quot; area!!!

2) OLD - one that was produced contemporaneously with the vehicle that it
is made to fit.  A new carburetor from VW/Mexico is not NOS.

2) STOCK - Was produced by the vehicle manufacturer (or under contract to
the manufacturer).  That chrome big foot gas pedal will never be NOS :-)

There are ongoing disputes about the meaning of each of these terms and
the term NOS all over the place.  The question of whether a Bugpac part,
still in its shrink wrap since the '70s is or can be NOS is hotly debated.
