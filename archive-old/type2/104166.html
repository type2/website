Subject: Re: [T2] Cooked condensor

Chris,

When the points open the coil primary voltage spikes (~ 200 volt), rapidly 
drops off to a lower voltage (~40 volts) for around 1 milli sec and then 
falls of to the battery voltage. These voltages vary some from system to 
system.

The capacitor and coil form a series resonate circuit. The resonant 
frequency and pulse response are system design consideration as are the 
maximum voltage rating and the dwell duration.

The coil and capacitor should be matched for best operation.

You said it failed. If it shorted it could warm-up the coil but do little 
harm to the wiring.

Chuck


&gt;&gt;As I understand it a 12 volt condensor is a condensor is a
&gt;condensor. That is 1 size fits all as long as the wiring works and it is 12 
&gt;volts. Correct?
