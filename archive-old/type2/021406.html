Hi Tony,
   Regarding cutting impossible bolt heads-
   A local to me used tool place sells 1.5&quot; MADE IN USA cut off disks
that will fit Dremyl cut-off disk shanks.  The brand is ENKAY, Brooklyn,
NY, $5.39 for 5 disks or $4.19 for 3 with included shank.  I use fine
brass washers on each side of the disk when bolted to the shank- they
are strong, last well, but drop the tool or crimp it sideways in a tight
spot, you can break the fibers around the center of the shank.  For
tight spots, one can get a right angle adaptor.
     With old allen head bolts, I use allen tipped sockets, they seem
harder than wrenches, and you can put them in a flex handle- beat on the
end of the socket as you apply torque with a small pipe over the flex
handle.  Works well on the wheel side cv as you can rotate the wheel so
the axle is up out of the way.  On the trans side you have less room to
work above the cv.  MB
