Subject: FS:  Friend parting out '71 Westy

The front axle beam of my friend's '71 Westy just died a sudden, rusty 
death, and after poking at the bottom of his bus with a screwdriver, he has 
decided to part it out rather than put another axle beam in.  (This 
surprised me, as the bus has no visible rust, but he says he discovered 
some frame rot, hidden by undercoating that the previous owner had sprayed 
on some time ago.)
Anyway, here are the best points:
        Engine completely rebuilt 40k miles ago, all German parts, oversized 
pistons (1684cc displacement, or something like that?), really nice job.
Also brand new generator, German clutch, etc.  This would be a turnkey high 
performance upright engine for someone who needs it.
        Poptop canvas brand new (aftermarket version, heavy duty canvas, tan, 
with zippered flaps/screens on 3 sides, not just front); he just paid a lot 
for this and never even finished installing it, just stapled it to the top 
of the poptop.
        Camper interior in very good condition, basically everything is 
there.
        All body parts in good shape, transaxle used but works fine, all 
glass good, etc.         

        Jon put a lot of love and money into this bus, so there's a lot of 
good stuff on it. He'd sell it in pieces, or whole. He doesn't have e-mail, 
but if you e-mail me I'll pass it on, or call him at (215) 234-8687.
