Subject: RE: [T2] Deep Cycle Battery FAQ (and reefer fans)

You're right, and I'm going for the 65 AH battery. I just can't afford
more than that in my budget, so I'll have to make it do. On that level,
the difference in weight between the AGM and wet cell is something I can
live with, assuming the difference in cycle life is as great as they
indicate.

Yes! I forgot to ask you about the reefer fans. I just removed my
non-working coleman stove, so now I can plumb some air easily from the
stove vent, which is right next to the back of the reefer, to a fan back
there on the heat transfer coils. I believe you said you just used
computer fans on the back side, and I happen to have two left over from
a gaming machine I built last year. The 12V fuse block is right there,
so I can wire them up easily at either end of some heater duct. Would I
be better off pulling hot air out high or pushing fresh air in low? 

Re the internal fan, I looked at an RV center the other day and didn't
find one, although I did get a thermometer. I'll keep looking.

It's going to be an early start tomorrow, so I'm out.

&gt;The ACM battery I'm looking at
&gt;weighs about 50 lbs, but I can live with that. As you know, It's mainly
&gt;the reefer draw I'm looking at, at 4.5 amps/hr, plus stereo (no power
&gt;amp) and interior lights.

 From the weight of your battery I'm guessing it's no more than 50 
amp-hours.  That is 40 useable (80% DOD) which is about 8 hours for your

fridge and lights (assuming only a couple of hours of lights, and 
intermittent fridge).  So it will just barely last you through one night
if 
everything is working well.

&gt;I do have a built-in 10amp charger when hooked
&gt;up to shore power. And I also want to use it as a backup cranker. So
the
&gt;trade-off should be okay for my application, don't you think?

If the 8 hours off of shore power is enough for you, then yes I think it

should be okay.  Do get the fridge fan though, the small amount of 
circulation inside the fridge will make a huge difference and allow you
to 
turn the thermostat down a couple of notches.  I verified this by 
installing a digital thermometer inside my refrigerator (using the
outdoor 
wire) and watching it for days at a time under a wide range of 
conditions.  The fridge fan is a $1 part that you have to pay $20 for,
but 
it is absolutely essential in hot weather.

&gt;I would
&gt;also like to ask you about the life of the ACM vs the gel relative to
&gt;number of discharge cycles. What I've read indicates the ACMs have an
&gt;advantage in that respect, although I have no numbers. Could you give
us
&gt;your view?

Er, ummmm... :)  I'm afraid I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to Gel 
cells.  I have only owned a few small ones years ago, and I did not have

good luck with them, but then I was not as careful back then with things

like rate of charge and (most important, it seems) not allowing them to 
stay discharged for any length of time.  On the other hand, the Hawker
AGM 
batteries I have been playing with lately are wonderful.  38lbs, 42 
amp-hours, and one of them can start my car easily even with it's large,

high-compression V-8 and every electrical load turned on high.  I'm 
thinking seriously about mouting one of them between the frame rails 
underneath the bus as the primary starting battery and using the old 
battery tray to store a decent sized toolbox.  I'm going to mount
another 
one inside the space-saver spare in the back of the Mustang for better 
weight distribution.  It fits perfectly!  About 7x9x4&quot;.  After reading
that 
excellent FAQ you posted, it seems pretty clear that the author thinks
AGM 
technology is superior to Gel.  Based on that and my own small amount of

experience I don't see any reason to go with a Gel cell over AGM.
