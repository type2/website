Subject: [T2]Blowby out dipstick update

http://pg.photos.yahoo_dot_com/ph/standingbearz/album?.dir=dcd2
ok so to update what has happened since i finally got the engine torn apart(heads off)
(didnt  split case) where to go now..?
is it the rings or is it something else.?
to me the pistons are pretty burned looking but that could be normal i wasnt thinking it was?
do they look like they have been burning rich or lean&gt;? i was thinking rich by blackness?
either way from the pictures can you tell what was causeing the oil to shoot out the dipstick hole?
i checked the pistons over really well and didnt see any gashes or anything in the pistons just the tops of them are burned looking and really flakey with black deposits?
 
where or what should i be looking for here now that i have the heads off and such&gt;?
 
where to now?
peace and love
chris
