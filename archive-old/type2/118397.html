Subject: Re: [T2] Throwout bearing clip problems

Mark Dearing just mentioned using throwout bearing clips with a loop that
allows them to be safety wired on. Contact Mark for the address where he
gets them.

&lt; 2. How can i keep this from occuring again? I have had these clips fail on
me twice now (this last time was the most disaterous) and I fear i may be
doing something wrong on the install of these clips allowing/causing them to
fall off.

Any help is much appreciated.

thanks,

John&gt;
