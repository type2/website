Subject: Re: 091 Ring and Pinion ratios

Steve,
As far as I know you will have no problem fitting the 1600 ring and pinion in 
an 091 case.  There is another ring and pinion that isn't as low as a 1600 
but not as high as yours.  It fall right in between and is out of a 75 bus.  
It was a one year only item.  Sorry I don't have the exact ratios right now 
for you but I can get them if you need them.  Good luck.

Don
