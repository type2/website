&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry to hear it. I think your assessment is correct. Can't be fixed
&gt; &gt;&gt; without teardown. Might or might not last who knows how long. You just have

&gt; &gt;didn't have a case when I did the rebuild year and half ago, the case was
&gt; &gt;thourghly inspected but obviously missed this.....I put almost $2,500 into
&gt; &gt;this 1gram balance rebuild, mahle piston, new cam, etc, etc, etc  really
&gt; &gt;can't afford to do this every year or so.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, good news. Now you must throw good time/money after salvaging the
&gt; good time/money put in there. If you know the crank/case oversizes for your
&gt; stuff, get a rebuild case with the same overbore mains and put all your

std/std

&gt; down the longblock and replace the case and reassemble would per but a few
&gt; hours for a pro, a few more for a savy, carefull, DIY'er. Sounds like you

but of course the removal/reinstall/setup/tunning

here are my ideas/options.  input would be appreciated 

*  take my chances and drive it as it is

*  take just the one side of the case off and have the boss (re)welded
back on, then reassembly  (not removing any bearings etc)

*  Send it out to major rebuilder (Boston Bob etc)

*  Try to convince the guy who did this rebuild to do it over (he has
retired, my engine was one of his last)

*  Try to find a GOOD case and do a rebuild rebuild.

*  in all cases try to find a &quot;running&quot; spare engine to keep my bus on the
road while I work on the main engine.

some questions

*  can you reweld the boss back on?? (I have all the pieces)
*  some of the above are not DM but I am looking at cost/benefit also
*  take into consideration that I have a single car garage that has no
heat and electric is basically an extension cord from the house.  Living
in the mid atlantic is cold wet during winter.  Bus does not &quot;fit&quot; into
the garage, the bus remains on the parking pad in front of the door.  
*  to do the rebuild work I would have to buy a few tools,  engine stand,
new dial micrometer for sure, think I have everything else I would need.
*  TIME, time is money and in short supply right now.  I have a major
project at work that is going to keep me pretty busy now til mid summer.

I'm sure I'll think of some more &quot;issues&quot;

* * *
personally I'm leaning towards driving it as it is until I can get a spare
engine and the time/money to do it right, knowing full well this is a
risk.  I would not touch the bolt etc again, do oil changes etc via the
drain plug, and change the filter more often.  I do run synthetic lubes,
and would probably put a buzzer of some sort on the oil presure switch.  I
do have oil presure/temp gauges.  during this time I will start gathering
the parts I need to do it over (case etc)


coments???  (besides damning GEX to the lower reaches of the crusher)
