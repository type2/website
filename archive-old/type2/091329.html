Subject: Re: [T2] NADA on drugs!

Hate to say it but the value of a bus works 2 ways. this is the bad
end of the stick. We can't have a bus value that is high for insurance
and low for everything else. Many people have worked quite hard to get
the NADA to raise the worth of busses. This stems from people getting
stiffed by their insurance companies due to an extremely low ball
figure. If it really bothers you you could always move south to AL
where it's (or at least when i lived there) based on the bill of
sale :).
