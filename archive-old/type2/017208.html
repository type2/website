&gt; Well I logged in to post about a clunking sound coming from my '78 bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Started yesterday when I was pulling out of my garage. The bus felt like it
&gt; was glued down with one deep CLUNK. I thought it was water on the floor of
&gt; the garage frozen to the tire. No outstanding sounds all was happy in the
&gt; bus during the ride to work.
&gt; 
&gt; But then similar clunk when I left my parking space at the end of the day.
&gt; I was distracted and did not make much of it then. Bit of a clunking sound
&gt; during the drive home; faint and only lasted for a few blocks.
&gt; 
&gt; This mornings CLUNK could not bet ignored. Same feeling of a tire stuck to
&gt; the floor. Denise was driving and thinks it was the front right wheel. But
&gt; then it started to clunk, keeping time with our speed. Went around the
&gt; block and parked it in front of our house.
&gt; 
&gt; I will be opening it up tonight when I get home.
&gt; 
&gt; I will start looking for a loose brake caliper.
&gt; 
&gt; Anything else I should be looking for?
&gt; 
&gt; I also need to mention that I use my parking brake.

ACHTUNG:
Check your lug nut tightness right now. It could be a wheel falling off!
(Wanna know how I know?)
Last Sunday night I was following my wife in her Vanagon home at highway
speeds and suddenly witnessed a shower of sparks from the left rear and
as she eased off to the shoulder the wheel crossed over and bounced thru
the ditch. Toll one mangled rear quarter panel and one lost lug nut.(The
rest were still in the hubcap, a little worse, but still functional).
Seems my electrician's helper employee had installed the snow tires. The
other 15 lug nuts were loose too. My last words on the subject had been
&quot;Naw, it's just that CV joint that's been going out&quot; when she told me
that she thought a wheel was falling off.
