Subject: Re: I hate my exhaust!!!

Ok, I went back out to look now the exhaust has cooled down again. 

It was a real PITA to get the muffler back on the HEs when I
reassembled. I didn't think much about it...

The left side HE has been cut and rewelded several times at the J
tubes. That explains quite a bit... If they're pulling against each
other with the muffler in, there may be enough torque to open up one
of the exhaust to head seals.

I think I'm going to stop here until I can get a new left HE. I'd like
to replace everything, but I'm going to be scrambling to find $$ for
the single HE.

Anybody in SoCal have one they'd sell cheap? Like really cheap? Really
really cheap? Swap for a original headlight switch, maybe? ;-) 
(Sorry, that's all I have. sigh) Or even better, entire thing with
muffler? LoL!

BusDepot has new VW HE's for $150, but with shipping will still be
$200. BustedBus wants $150 each used, so same price and they're OOS at
the moment anyway. That's about $190 more than I can afford. Ok not
that bad, but you get the idea...
