Subject: 72' bus 1700 distributor and carb set up

OK, need some help guys....
I have been restoring this bus for my teenage son for some time now and I am
almost done. The engine has been changed from the dual carbs to a single
progressive Weber (model unknown) and a 009 distributor with electronic
ignition in it (all changes done before I got the thing). I have been
looking thru the achieves and can't seem to find and answer to a simple flat
spot question for this engine. I am finding out the 1700 is some what
different than all the others. Since the dual carbs are gone, what
distributor do I need to fix this. Does it need to be vacuum advanced? Is
the carb set up for a vacuum (don't remember a port for it off the top of my
head)? The t4 engine would have had a 005 in it with both advance and retard
from what the book of common wisdom said, and set at 5 degrees after TDC.
I have read that the centrifugal timing advance are different for the single
carb to the dual carb and the Weber vacuum is not set up for a vacuum
advance, is this true? Thought I would consult the experts!
 
Thanks, Tom
