Subject: Re: [T2] Canvas cleaning, Cot location

im not sure.  the 68 westy i took my cot out of had a
small leather pouch on the end of the cabinet.  i dont
think it stuck out that far, but enough to necessitate
that leather protector.  quirky little things these
westys are:)

&gt; There is a plastic

&gt; 71 different from a 69?
