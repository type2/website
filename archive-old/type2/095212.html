Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic clutch


&gt;
&gt;My other question is... Why?

My answer would have to be: &quot;Why not?&quot;

	Shying away from the convenience of a self-adjusting clutch setup seems as 
sensible to me as refraining from fuel-injection and pointless ignition.  I 
have owned more than a few vehicles with hydraulic clutches, and (as long as 
they are properly maintained, just like the brake hydraulics) have never 
suffered a leak, much less a catastrophe.  To each their own, I always say 
though.  If the 'upgrade' is too difficult, or seems unnecessary, don't 
undertake the process.  I don't know about you folks, but my wife is 5 foot 
3 and can barely provide the braking and clutch power necessary to control 
my '70.  Adding power-discs and a hydraulic clutch is a way to include my 
wife in the pleasure we all share while driving our vehicles.

	Eron
