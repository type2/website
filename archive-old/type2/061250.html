While traveling I use the little strap behind the rear seat, so that it
sits on the bed cushion, while in camp I put it in a Duluth Pack Liner
(this is a very thick heavy duty plastic bag used to line a Duluth Pack
backpack, available from http://www.piragis_dot_com ) and stick it under the
bus or in the luggage area on top.  The pack liner protects it against
rain.  If I am really tired and lazy, I just stick in between the
drivers seat and door.

&gt; On the back lower corner of the rear cupboard (next to the cushion) is a
&gt; strap...what does it attach to/hold in place??...it's hidden for the
&gt; most part by the cushion...

This is used to hold the &quot;cupboard/cubby top&quot; down so that it does not
rattle on rough roads.
