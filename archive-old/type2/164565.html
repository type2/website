Subject: RE: [T2] 6-rib transmission swap (longer)

No opinion is right or wrong, it is the combination of all that lends the
best advice.

Running a modified motor with a non-stock transmission; don't expect stock
results. Just be prepared for the downsides and the benefits! There are
always trade-offs in the mod game. :)

Happy Bussing,

&gt;However, I wouldn't recommend a 091 in a type 1 motor unless you are doing
&gt;the majority of your driving on a mostly flat freeway. The gearing is too
&gt;high for a 1776 to do any significant hills. My Double Cab has a
&gt;high-revving and high-horsepower 1914. It is still taxed and slow on big
&gt;hills due to the Type 1 motor's inherently lower usable torque in
comparison
&gt;to a Type 4 motor.

I know everyone has their opinion, no offense to Jon but I must beg to
differ on this one and insist that 1776/091 is an excellent combo for an
early bay IF SET UP RIGHT for HP/torque/revs.  It's still a bus; a
sub-2-Liter engine is going to be taxed in any case.  Single stock carb and
stock heads are not going to cut it.

For the past 3 years I have been running an 091/1776 combo in my 70 westy.
Daily flogging on the hectic freeways of Atlanta when I still lived there,
all over the appalachian mountains, around the high passes of Colorado, and
coast-to-coast at freeway speed.  Significant hills.  I'd say compared to
the stock 1600/stock trans it's lugging much less. . .

Specs on this motor are:
	-counterweighted crankshaft, dynamically balanced w/flywheel
	-big-valve 40/35.5 041 heads w/ported intake and exhaust
	-Dellorto DRLA36 dual carbs with match-ported manifolds
	-Engle 100 &quot;bus&quot; cam
	-8.0:1 CR
	-full-flow filter etc.

&gt;But, if you can live with it, you will see slightly better mileage numbers,
&gt;a little better shifting and slightly higher cylinder head temperatures.
The
&gt;temps are from having to lug the motor more and the fan turning slower and
&gt;lower RPM's.

Believe it or not, I have had NO head temp problems with this setup.  I have
a CHT gauge.  it runs cooler and smoother than anything else I have ever
run, at moderate RPM's keeping it in the power band.  I credit the efficient
heads, and &quot;quench&quot; theory on the moderately low deck height.  

Granted, it's set up rich and my MPG has been on the poor side.  Need to
re-jet for my current elevation of 6400 ft.  The OIL does get hot on
sustained climbs and/or ambient temps above 95 deg F.  I'm going to install
an RX7 oil cooler/thermostat for next summer's travels.  I'm not finished
experimenting, would like to try some 1.25 ratio rockers, and someday build
a 1914.

Just another data point for y'all, 2 more cents in the pot.  Yes, high po
engines need more maintenance, it's a slippery slope, and I've learned some
lessons the hard way.  such as the need for solid rocker shafts with HD
valve springs, etc. (if anyone remembers last summer's adventures).

best wishes to all.
