Subject: looking for Puyallup bus for sale..

I am looking for the owner of the bus that was for sale at the Puyallup show
this last weekend.  It is a 68-71 Westfalia and it was parked in the for sale
area beside the &quot;Jiffy&quot; panel bus.  It was on dolly I think and for sale for
$1850.  Unfortunately I didn't get his number so I am wondering if anyone knows
him or his phone number.  If so email me at &lt;PaulKlein_at_telus_dot_net&gt; or phone
me at 604 730 6820.  Thanks a whole lot!
Paul
