I have been in the same spot as you - little locally that's not full of rust
- and even the ones full of rust are over $2000. I am ending up buying a bus
out of the California high desert that is in need of a new engine (luckily
my old bus has a fresh one in it). $3000 + between $900 and $1400 for
shipping it to Virginia and it's mine!

I know that I am probably paying too much for this one, but it is worth it
to me and right now that's what is important. It's a Champagne Edition and
it has the features I am looking for, and it has NO RUST. It does have a
couple of dents, however and will need to have a little body work done when
it gets here.

The shipping is $$ gone, but how much would it cost to fly out there and
drive it back? I would rather do that then have it shipped, but I do not
have the time (and this bus doesn't have the engine) to make the trip.

Good luck finding your bus!

&gt; There was one in San Diego that initially sounded promising. It's
&gt; for sell for 3500. It's a '72 Westy also, but I'm now  told there's some
&gt; rust, and it's all the way across the country. I've done some checking and it
&gt; will cost $1605 to get it shipped to Mobile, Al. It's that or the cost of a
&gt; one way plane ticket and driving across country with a bus I don't know, and
&gt; No mechanical skills, which I think adds up to a dumb move. I would also have
&gt; almost as much money tied up, and the $1600 for shipping is just gone money,
&gt; you know?
