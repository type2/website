Subject: Re: [T2] replacement body panels

Hey Jon,

I think they only make panels for splitties, from what I can see. Also,
Brian is suggesting we use the body panel adhesive. He says they only weld
if it's structural. I know there's been opinions about this before, and it
would probably be fine for the rear corner, but I would think the doglegs
need to be welded.

Thoughts on this?

&gt; Hey Jon,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the note. I'm going to be working with him, and his shop is
&gt; about 200 yards from my office, so it makes it pretty easy to keep up on it.
&gt; He's a good body man, but hasn't done buses, so I'm trying to get as much
&gt; advice from the list as possible to help guide him. He is extremely open to
&gt; suggestions.
&gt;
&gt; Man, 15k! Wow. It must look great.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Ned,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Kelly at Metwiz_dot_com recommends using KlassicFab replacement panels.
&gt; &gt; There is
&gt; &gt; evidence they are of higher quality and design. This will help with the
&gt; &gt; body
&gt; &gt; work. Buses are not that difficult to repair the metal, but being
&gt; &gt; unibody,
&gt; &gt; expect more rust than you see.
