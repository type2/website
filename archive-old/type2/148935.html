Subject: Re: [T2] More KONI's Now Available!

&gt;in my case it is a daily driver, it is my only vehicle and I've had it for
&gt;13 years now and plan on keeping it as long as I can. so putting a few
&gt;bucks into is for me a good investment, other folks will have to make
&gt;other decisions, this goes not just for shocks but for everything you do
&gt;with your bus.

This is where it is at for me.  My bus is my daily driver as well and I want 
the best handling, safest bus I can.  That goes for the tires and brakes as 
well.  My bus might need some help in the body category, but underneath it is in 
brand new condition. And it has been said here before, you get what you pay 
for.
 
And, when a quality part no longer becomes available, that's it!  Have you 
tried to find a type 4 Wahler thermostat lately?  How about new, in the box 
Hella front turn signal lenses for '68-'72 bus? And the copy's just don't come 
close to the originals. I believe when an opportunity opens itself, you better 
jump on it.
