Subject: Temp 2 Sensor Stand-off

Vehicle:  78 VW Riviera Conv, 2.0L, nearly all stock
or correct parts except the Dizzy.
    
Background info:  The T2 sensor 100% failed before
Christmas, and I replaced it in Late December.  New
Sensor caused new problem.  Grrr.  New part is
BOS-0-280-130-012, which shows as correct for 78
2-liter bus.  Old sensor paper label is marked &quot;012A.&quot;
 Is there a Temp 2 sensor REVISION I should be using
instead?
    
Problem:  Replacement T2 temp sensor is not working
well.  Physically located near third cylinder.  
      
Symptoms:  Start-up cold, all well.  Uhhh, all well
for only about 15 seconds.  Then speed drops, caughing
starts.  When fully warm, all runs well.  But during
the warm-up between cold and hot, it loads-up, coughs,
chokes, has trouble holding an idle...I need to keep
the pedal depressed to keep the engine running.  And
all I changed was the T2 sensor.
    
What I think I know:  T2 sensor needs to be moved away
from head by an inch or two.  Still connected, but
stood-off from the head to slow heat transfer. The T2
sensor has M10-1 threads.  Vendor search....A1
Coupling, various auto parts stores, most don't have
metric fittings.  So I haven't been able to find a 1&quot;
or 3/4&quot; M10-1.0 fitting(measurement mis-match, 1&quot;
length, Metric threads, I know).  Internet search of
&quot;vw m10-1 tee&quot; produces too many results and don't
want to chance mail-ordering the wrong part.  Assuming
my diagnosis is correct.  :-o
   
Could a list member hasten my solution and reduce my
frustation?  Where?  How much?  Correct Diagnosis
above?  Seems like this was discussed in Nov or Dec
'04, but couldn't find from T2 archive.
