Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Wheel cylinders - Do Type3 fit Type 1??


I thought so as well.  REGARDLESS of whether you have front discs or not, it 
is the fact that your rear brakes need to allow the vehicle to roll without 
locking that is at issue.  Rear brake lock= uncontrollable.  On a bus, I 
believe they have a proportioning valve post circa '71.
