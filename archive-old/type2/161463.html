Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Not-a-new-bus

Funny enough, last night I watched THE definitive movie about the  
Free Software/GNU/Open Source movement.

&quot;Revolution OS.&quot; I highly recommend it.

I guess the largest problem with Open Source cars would be  
distributed manufacturing, though.

Figure out that piece, and the collective dream of a better/cheaper  
vehicle could become a reality.

Nonetheless...the VW platform seems to be about as close to Open  
Source as you can get.

Anton - Beetles and Buses and BSD, of my!

&gt; Open-source cars? The automakers like to make lots, and lots of  
&gt; money or they would be building cars like the original Beetle which

&gt; we would only be able to buy repair parts and repair services from  
&gt; the dealer.
