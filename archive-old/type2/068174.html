&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;        I'm trying to get my '74 Sportsmobile all adjusted for one final
&gt;trip before the winter storage begins, and am having some trouble.  It seems
&gt;that I have three different mixture adjustment screws, one on top of the
&gt;left carb, just left of the idle adjustment screw, one midway down on the
&gt;left side of the left carb, and one midway down on the right side of the
&gt;right carb.  I have Muir and Haynes to go by, but neither mentions the
&gt;proper adjustment for all three.  One said to adjust both of the side
&gt;mixture screws all the way in, and then back them each out 2 1/2 turns,
&gt;etc..., but never mentioned the third screw up by the idle screw.  I can't
&gt;afford a $299 UniSyn, so I'm just leaving the linkage alone, but would like
&gt;to take my best shot at getting the mixture right.  Any suggestions on how
&gt;to get all three screws in their proper positions?

The 2.5 turns on the two side screws is a good start.  Here's what I do:


First, check your plugs, wires, and points.  Set everything to specs.
Check for vacuum leaks.  Make sure your timing isn't too far off.  No point
fiddling with the carbs till this is done - it will be time wasted.

Now turn two side screws in then 2.5 turns out as described.  Start bus.
On left carb, turn in the side idle adjustment screw until the RPM starts
to drop.  Stop and back it out 1/2 turn.  Do the same on the other carb.
If these screws are misadjusted (too far in) it will cause the engine to
backfire during deceleration (my experience).

Now pull all four wires at the coil one at a time and make sure the RPM
drops an approximately equal amount for the left and right banks of
cylinders.  If so, you have the idle mixture set fairly well, and your idle
shutoff solenoids are working (ugh).  If you have a dead cylinder at idle
it's probably either the mixture screw overtightened or a bad shutoff
solenoid.

Now fiddle with the small adjustment screw on the top of the left carb.  On
my bus, it doesn't seem to make much difference where it is set, so I just
set it 2.5 turns out and leave it.  The bus runs fine.

One other thing I have found with the dual carbs:  it is VERY important
that the linkage is set to open them at the same time.  Tug slightly on the
accelerator cable where it attaches to the crossbar (don't grab any part of
the crossbar though!) and watch the stops on each carb.  Make sure that the
linkages are beginning to move at exactly the same time.  Also check that
the accelerator pumps are being actuated at the same time.  Adjust the
linkage if necessary.  For me, this almost always makes a HUGE difference
in driveability.  The carbs being slightly off makes your part throttle
acceleration suffer badly.

&gt;        Also one more problem, carb related.  When cold, the engine idles
&gt;nice and fast and smoothly, but after its warmed up, and I kick down the
&gt;choke, it idles too slowly and backfires (popcorn sound) alot.  I have
&gt;repeatedly set the idle to 900rpm, at operating temp, but it keeps returning
&gt;to the slow idle.  Is it possible that when my mixture is set correctly this
&gt;will straighten itself out, or is there something else amiss?

I had a similar problem where when warm it would idle slow.  Flooring the
throttle briefly usually brought back the high idle.

In my case it was the large solenoid that shuts off the air to the idle
circuit.  It's in the very front of the left carb, horizontal.  It was
sticking closed.  I have several of the solenoids and they ALL stick.  I
finally removed it, put a washer over it, and reinstalled it (so it's about
1/8&quot; farther out now).  No more slow idle.

Hope this helps,

- -David
