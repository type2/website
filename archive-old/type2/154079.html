Subject: Ahh!!! Not another vehicle!!!

Hey guys,

    This is VW related, not necessarily Bus related. I hope you guys don't
mind giving me a little bit of advice. I came across this 1970 VW Beetle
that's for sale about 15 miles from my house. The body looks to be in
excellent shape. There doesn't appear to be ANY rust outside, but there is
some slight rust at the very base of the door frame (not visible from the
outside, but visible from the inside). I have no problem welding, and since
it's not anything that's really visible, I'm not too concerned.

The engine is complete, but the guy says it doesn't run (doesn't list why).

I'm going to look at it this weekend. Anyway, I've never owned a Beetle
before... well, except for my wife's 04 Beetle Convertible, but I was
wondering if you guys have any advice you can give me when I go to take a look
at it. (IE: trouble spots, etc...)


Man, I really shouldn't have been looking. This is such an addiction. I am 95%
complete with my 73 Bus, the last thing I needed was to see this deal. I've
GOT to finish my Bus. (I get it registered this weekend!!!)



Thanks!

Todd
