Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Accident

I doubt very much that the bus' insurance company will go to court to fight 
for repair
costs on a bus that was being illegally driven (expired tags)  and was not 
carrying 
collision insurance.  The 2 insurance companies will decide to not pay the 
other drivers
repairs and the bus driver will be stuck for his own repair costs since he 
didn't have collision
insurance.   I may be wrong but thats my take on how things will probably 
shake out.....
