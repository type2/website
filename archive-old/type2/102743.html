Subject: Re: [T2] 68 rear drum - what will interchange

64-67 is a 615E......not interchangeable at all with the 615G.

I did a little more research on the 211 609 439D and 440D part numbers:
They are the backing plate part numbers.

&gt; Bus Boys says the G fits 68-70 but they throw in an exception:
&gt; &quot;211-501-615G Rear Drum, Bus/Pickup Late 68-70 (Fr VIN 2x8 104 707)&quot;
&gt; But they do not say what fits 2x8 000 001 to 2x8 104 706??

Looking up the backing plate number, it says 'to Ch. no. 210 2300 000' which is the end of 70. But it also
says ( to chassis number 218 109 823, see Workshop Bulletin B - 14/68)
So this means the 68's from 218 000 001 to 218 109 823 uses a different backing plate/drum?  This is 5100
buses later than Bus Boys footnote.

Anyone have Workshop Bulletin B - 14/68??

From: &quot;andy&quot;
&gt; This is very possible. A lot of changes were happening in the first few
&gt; months of 68 production. I wouldnt be surprised if seversl month only
&gt; brake parts are among them.
&gt; I feel like a lot of parts were holdovers from 67 that were in the process
&gt; of changing. So if a 615 doesnt fit maybe compare the drum to a 67 drum.
