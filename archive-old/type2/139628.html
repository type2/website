Subject: Re: [T2] 55 mph speed limit

Richard,

As someone mentioned last week....$$$$$$$$$$$$

As I may have mentioned last week on this thread, I believe the actual 
problem was that to meet emissions, they head temps had to be raised past 
the limits that vw had set in order to meet emissions.

The Porsche guys had a lot more money to work with and thought that their 
car *had* to be air cooled to be &quot;cool&quot;...or else weren't ready to go 
water cooled yet.

The Porsche engineers occasionally screw up big time as well.

Sometime around 1972 or so, we at VPC found ourselves rebuilding 911 turbo 
waste gates.  Seems that they failed at around 20,000 miles with almost
clockwork precision...even after rebuilding....Probably $500 labor to 
replace and $500 for the part....wonder how long a warranty was on a 911 
turbo?  and remember, this was in 1972 Dollars!

LOL!

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;Porsche managed to keep the 911 air cooled until the 1998 when the first 
&gt; &gt;water cooled 911 was produced.

&gt; I don't think one fully explains the other. How did a 
350HP 6-cyl pass emissions in 1997 when a 4-cyl bus couldn't in 1984?
