Subject: Spare tire mounting bracket

I was recently given a spare mount for the front of the bus.  I plan on
setting it so the tire actually sits on the bumper.

I was wondering what purpose the two holes with welded nuts are for.  I
figure that the cutout goes towards the bottom when the bracket's mounted,
putting the holes at the bottom of the bracket, but could not for the life
of me figure out what the two holes/nuts were for.  Does anyone know?
