Subject: Re: Shredded Hoses

Tonight I replaced the hoses that go from the fan shroud to the Heat
exchangers. When I did so I realized that they are just barely touching one of
the tubes on my aftermarket exhaust. I'm no genius, but that's a bit too much
heat for that coated cardboard tubing stuff to handle. So what would be the
best way to prevent this?? Fabricate some sort of metal tube that is down near
the exhaust and comes up through the tin, then hook my hose to that? Someone
mentioned that this is how the stock setup works. Please tell me if I'm on the
right track

Thanks,
Zach
