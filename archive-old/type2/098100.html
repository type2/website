Subject: Re: Removing Luggage Rack Pop Rivets

You just drill them out!  Pick a drill that is just barely bigger than
the through hole in the rivet and upsize if needed.  I did this when I
had the luggage rack removed.  Bought stainless oval head screws and
stainless nuts to replace the rivets, although re-riveting would be fine.
 Believe the screws size was 10-24 or simliar.  I plan to locktite on the
nuts since on since you cannot reach the nuts after the carrier is back
on the roof -  and with stainless steel you cannot count on rust - the
greatest locking compound of all time!

&gt;I want to replace my luggage rack tie downs, I have figgured 
out how to get the rack off, but now that its off I can't 
figure out how to get the pop vivets out. Any ideas?

Thanks,
Chris
