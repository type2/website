Ooh! I LUV going to junkyards! Does this make me part of the club (my
wanting to take my impending brake job to a mechanic notwithstanding)? I'd
like to thank those that offered advice, especially the snotty advice (you
know who you are ;-)). I may give it a shot; if everything goes well, it
might not be as hard as I made it out to be. Anyway, I keep telling myself
that riding my bike to work until I get the brakes fixed is good for me.
I'll let you all know how it turns out.

No one who has ever purchased over the counter at VW is going to laugh at
the bill for MT's new door hinge.  On the other hand, MT calls driving
from junkyard to junkyard a waste of time, which calls into question his
qualifications for aircooled vehicle ownership.
