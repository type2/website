&gt; Hi all-
&gt; Geez, didn't mean to start such a discussion!
&gt; Let me clarify my situation. I'm rebuilding a 1600 for my 71 Camper.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; I'm interested in building a reliable,
&gt; hopefully long-lived, stock displacement single carb engine.

Tom:
A really good plan, but a type 1 engine is altogether a different kettle of
fish, especially for changing to hydraulics. Easiest MIGHT be to get a Beetlemex
hydraulic short block (or the whole motor), but I'm not sure if the oil filter
will work with the mustache (rear mount) bar. With hydraulics, a full flow
filter is mandatory. It's a heck of a good idea anyway. Next idea would be to
send the crankcase to a machine shop that specialises in hydraulic lifter
conversions.
It'll likely need lineboring anyway, they all do.
