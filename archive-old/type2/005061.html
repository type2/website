A friend just had a local shop powder coat all 4 brake backing plates for a
Bus.  Is this a
fair/typical price?

&gt;&gt;  If you are going to have your rims powder coated the coater has to use a
powder primer.  Also make sure you have the wheels blasted with something
besides glass bead.  The wheel needs to be somewhat rough for the powder to
adhere to it well.  Your best bet may be to find a place that will do the
blasting so that they won't sit for a long time or be handled before they
are powder coated.
