&gt; I love it!!!  The most interesting meta-analysis is:
&gt; 
&gt; Readers &quot;Always or Sometimes&quot; Perform Maintenance on Own Vehicle.......91.0%
&gt; 
&gt; TOOL OWNERSHIP (Purchased or Plan to Purchase in the Next 12 Months.)
&gt; Automotive Hand Tools.........................87.8%
&gt; 
&gt; which means to me that 3.2% of VWT readers are chewing the nuts off with
&gt; their teeth! (that or 3.2% of VWT readers count &quot;filling the gas tank&quot; as
&gt; maintainance :-)

nah it means that 3.2% already own every tool known to man, (my wife
thinks I am one of them, but I know better)
