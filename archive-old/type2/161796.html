Hi Karl,

I live near Ashland, Oregon, about 3 to 4 hours from you.  There are  
bazillions of busses around here.  In Medford (12 miles away) there  
is an import parts store that specializes in air-cooled VWs, in  
Talent (3 miles away) there is a junk yard with a half dozen bay  
window busses and a bunch of bugs and Vanagons.  In Weed, California  
(about 40 miles south) there is a junk yard with a gaggle of bays,  
splitties, and bugs.

It might be a bit of a drive but the country is beautiful and the  
area has great live theater (Three theaters), live concerts (Britt  
festival) and lots of great restaurants.  Go ahead and move...you'll  
be glad you did.

Jeff
