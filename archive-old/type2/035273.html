Subject: Re: Throttle switch, or lack thereof [call for help]

I *think* they got rid of the throttle switch in later years, but I couldn't
swear by it.

...which brings me to the following call for help: If anyone has VW
Fuel-Injection troubleshooting manual(s) for the years '76 through '83,
please send a photocopy my way! The info would allow me to generalize the
online HTML FI troubleshooter at
http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/afc/afc.html

Thanks!

Sami
