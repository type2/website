Subject: Free Engines 

I have two engines that I would like to give away. One is from a 
1977 van. When I bought the van, I was told that it needed to be re-
built. I never had the time to do it, so I bought a used engine. The 
second  one eventually made some horrible valve-sounding noises. 
Thinking that the second engine was toast, I bought a third engine. 
When I pulled the head, it looked ok. Now I need to recover some 
room in my garage, so it's time for the engines to go. The '77 has 
solid lifters, the '78 has hydraulic. E-mail me &amp; let me know if you 
are interested.
