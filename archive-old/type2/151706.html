Richard,

Were these different than what goes on our buses?

If not, then see my post in the archives...and someone elses much earlier 
ones for the exact Wells part number to order from your FLAPS.

I waited about 3-4 days for mine...had the Bosch logo and exact correct 
stroke number on it...works great on the 78.  Looked &quot;just&quot; like the one 
in your picture, but doesn't come in a Bosch box.

I think I paid $9 or so + tax

Finally Gotcha!&lt;big grin&gt;

Cheers, dave

 They were the only source for these brand new low cost Bosch vacuum cans I located a few months ago:
