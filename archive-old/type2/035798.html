Subject: 71 bus for sale in nebraska

hey all, 
ive passed this bus time and time again for over a
year.   it is a 71 westy located in omaha nebraska,
(its on the air force base)  its white with some rust
in usual places only one spot through i beleive.   its
white with the westy interior consisting of sink,
fridge, pop top with upper cot, and westy middle
stool.   the interior is very clean and a couple boxes
of misc parts inside, front seats have a tear or two. 
its got an oil cooler on the side and looks to be the
1600 engine which is clean, not really oily or
anything.   not a bad bus at all.  the sign says $1500
or best offer, and to reiterate its been there over a
year so who knows how low the guy might go.   the
phone # is 402-293-8222.   i dont know who it is but i
figured maybe someone could use a westy, since no one
on base seems to want it.   where are all the hippy
airmen?:)   if you want to check it out call the guy
or drop me an email and we can meet up and ill drive
you on base(you need a sticker on your car)to check it
out.  hope someone wants this old girl.
peace,
shelby
