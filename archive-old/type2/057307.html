Subject: Type IV motor into a 71 Westy
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I remember seeing a posting for this but was not paying much attention. It
does sound like a better motor overall.

&gt;From what I can remember... the flywheel is the &quot;major&quot; item that must be
changed, or reworked. Is this the only thing ???

I may go with a slightly fattened Type IV with a set... or one carb... any
other imput would be helpful.
