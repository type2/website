&gt; Supposedly the prev owner drained/filled and I do believe him. This
&gt; could mean it wasn't properly topped off?

Maybe he got it from someone who ran it dry and it's finally showing the
symptoms of that &quot;plan for replacement in the next 12-18 months&quot; note I
added?

Maybe he didn't get the drain plug quite tight and it's been slow dripping
when it's running and warm so it's low now. Tranny's and engines generally
leak only when running and the oil is being forcibly moved
around/pressurized. Drips in your driveway are usually from places that oil
has blown and accumulated while driving rather than from the actual
interior of the engine/tranny. The location of the tranny drain plug means
that if it's leaking like that it may not accumulate anywhere to show a
drip when it's parked in your driveway.
