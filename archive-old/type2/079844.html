Subject: Re: [T2] water injection (was alternate fuels)

Around here, many of the old farm tractors had water injection on them from
the factory.  You could really tell a difference when the tractor was
pulling hard and you turned up the water a bit.

If you think about it, water (H2O) when broken down has two parts hydrogen
which burns very well and one part oxygen which helps support a flame or
burn, and with high combustion chamber temps, doesn't the water brake down
like it would under electrolisis (sp?)?


&gt;&gt;&gt; he has a water alcohol injection on the
&gt; intake, which does nothing they are claimed to increase gas mileage etc.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Water injection is used to curb detonation in high-compression race
&gt; engines.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been wondering what happened  ese tins.  When I was in my high
&gt; hormone years, say 20 years ago, you couldn't open a hot rod mag without
&gt; seeing half a dozen ads for water injection.  Now they're passe.  I wondered
&gt; if it was due to the availability of efi and computerized ignition.
&gt; 
&gt; Always seemed kind of odd to me that one would try to increase the
&gt; volumetric efficiency with a supercharger, only to have to take up half the
&gt; volume with water vapor, but I'm sure the numbers crunch out differently.
