I am getting conflicting and confusing answers which seem to be mostly
dependent on who has what to sell.  The simple question is ...

Without major modifications, (cutting and welding etc..) what motors can I
put into my 1972 camper bus.  Currently of course it has the stock 1700 CC
motor.  I plan to replace this or just rebuild it stronger in the next 3-6
months (trying to wait till the frost is gone from the pumpkin in MT) .

Here are the criteria  

As mentioned do not want to cut or weld anything that would detract from
stock appearance.
Interested in keeping this vehicle Air cooled 
Want the most horsepower and torque I can get while still keeping this
daily driver reliable.

I would think that anything from a pre vanagon bus would work but have been
told differently.

I think this list definitely is the last word in VW  type 2 answers and so
am looking forward to responses.
