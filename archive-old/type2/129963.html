Subject: Advice and/or part needed in PNW

Well, I kinda &quot;dropped&quot; my 2.0L T4 engine last night getting it off the 
stand.  Almost everything survived .. except the passenger-side heater
duct, the one from the heaterbox to the flapper next to the flywheel.

I'm new to the Portland area ..is there a junkyard with Busses in the 
area?  Or someplace that would have used Bus stuff?  The only yard
I've been to (so far) is the U-Pull-It on Foster and I almost &quot;fell over&quot; it
looking for someplace else.

Or, failing that, does anyone have a &quot;spare&quot; they could sell me?  This 
is the &quot;wrong&quot; time of year to worry about the heat, but I don't want 
to be out the cold in October fixing it .. BTDT.
