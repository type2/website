Subject: trade: heat exchangers '77
Message-ID: &lt;3739D8C1.84939000_at_cais_dot_com&gt;

I have:    Like new '77 heat exchanger (right side) which is 'welded' to
the crossover pipe.

I want:    Absolutely NEW heat exchanger (right side) which is NOT
'welded' to the crossover pipe.

I would like to trade my heat exchanger + crossover pipe + elbow
(detached - clean and solid) for a new non-mexico or brazilian heat
exchanger (right side, thank you).

Reason:  If I have to use my current heat exchanger (right side), I will
trash the crossover pipe.  I don't need this original styled setup.  I
am sure someone can use this '77 crossover pipe, and it probably cannot
be detached from the heat exchanger without damaging the crossover pipe.

The exhaust elbow is good.
