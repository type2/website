&gt; Not correct. It is 1974 and older starting 1/1/03. 1975 and older starting

Isn't it pre-1974?

&gt; The original SB42 was vetoed because of the 25 year drop-off. Kopp had to
&gt; rewrite it to 30 years
&gt; with a 5 year moratorium on 1973 year model vehicles to get it passed.

Below it says 30 years or older as of 1/1/03 which to me means a 1973
vehicle will have turned 30 on Jan 1st but 1974 will have to wait another
year.  If I'm wrong it's odd to me that it's called a 30 year exception.

Here is part of SB42:

This bill would, instead, exempt from those requirements any motor
vehicle manufactured prior to the 1974 model-year or, beginning
January 1, 2003, that is  30 or more model-years old.
