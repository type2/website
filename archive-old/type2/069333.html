Subject: FI fuel mixture adjustment?

Last question for friday. Is there the equivalent of a fuel mixture
adjustment on the Vnagon fuel injection system? Despite the fact that I am
very well tuned and the engine seems to run very well, my gas mileage is
still very poor, 12.5 to 13.5, even on highway conditions. That in
combination with a somewhat sooty tailpipe would ordinarily lead me to guess
that the mix is too rich but to my knowledge there is no adjustment screw or
the like on this thing. Am I right about this?

Does the C0 adjusting screw that I see in the Haynes relate to this?  If not,
what does it relate to?

Thanks,

Weston
