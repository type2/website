&gt;briefly. Using an ohm meter, I was able to get 0 resistance
&gt;between one wire and pin 9 of the ECU plug...which maps to pin 9
&gt;of the intake air sensor. The other wire shows 0 resistance to pin
&gt;12 of the ECU. Problem is, I can't figure out where/how to hook these up.

I am betting that what you have is a '76 harness.  I would also bet that 
you confused the #9 pin with the # 27. If not, those wires may be 
reversed in your main harness plug. Do you have continuity between #9 on 
the main plug and #9 on the AFM plug?

Wires to 12 and 27 on a '76 harness went to a switch on the throttle, 
which enriched the mixture at full throttle. On a '77, that work is done 
by the AFM and the wires are superfluous.
