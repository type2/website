&gt; Hiya RD,

&gt; So..............is VoA still running this program?  Or was it &quot;this is your
&gt; one and only chance&quot; kinda thing?

No, it was probably run so that VWoA could gather evidence that they
weren't poisoning the general populace with asbestos.  Now that they have
all the old parts they need it is over.  No problem for you, though as '70
heat exchangers don't have asbestos and that was the part being replaced.
