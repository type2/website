&gt;Really, whats an airbag compared to a chance to really connect with your

Yes a good connection with you VW is essential, like the time I almost
rearended a club member because we were following too close.  VW
brakes......what brakes??
I barely knicked his stinger pipe, put my knee through the emergency light
switch and cracked my head on the my safari window.  I say that's a connection. 

Or the time my friend was in Santa Cruz, CA and found a 23 window bus.  They
had no way of getting it back over the Santa Cruz mountains so they towed it
up to the summit and coasted it down to the bottom.  Funny thing is, it had
no motor and only an E-brake.  They just about got mowed over by a semi.
Gotta love your VW to put your life on the line like that.

Or the time, I only hand tightened the wheel to my girlfriend's oval.  Well
I got an interesting call in the middle of the day.  After the wheel came
off it rolled down the road and hit two cars.  

I would say that making that connection with the VW is essential part of
growing up, if of course you make it to adulthood and start actually fixing
all the problems with your VW that could get yourself killed.

Regards,
