&gt;This will work, but it will be messy, and it may release fluorocarbons
&gt;into the environment. Follow these instructions at your own risk.

&gt;Puncture the can with a sharp stick. Once the contents are no longer
&gt;under pressure the soft metal of the can will be a lot easier to
&gt;compress. Now use a blunt stick to smash the can flat until the
&gt;diameter is reduced enough to get the door open.

Why not unbolt the fridge / sink and move it out of the way?
