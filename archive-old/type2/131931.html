Subject: It just died -Update 2-

As mentioned previously the bus (1978 FI 2.0) just quit on the freeway. 
Since having it flatbedded home, I've changed the fuel filter, fuel pump, 
ignition coil, points, condenser, rotor, cap, plugs and wires. She still 
won't catch. I don't know what else to do. Any suggestions?
