Someone recently suggested we try bartering some parts on the list.  Because
I've received so much help with parts and info on this list, I thought I'd
reciprocate and offer some free or minor-cost items.  This is in partial
repayment to people like Karl von Salzen, who consistently supplies me with
at-cost parts, and Janyce Reiss, who, bless her heart, once sent me a free
steering
box.  Any item you request you pay shipping on, of course  And please don't
ask for something just to add to your stash - you should really NEED this
part now.

Free items:(These came as part of stashes with various vehicle buys last
year..lots more parts to come if this works out)
1.  Steering wheel in great shape PN 311 415 651 G.
2.  Sapphire XXV radio, probably needs some work, as it only gets 2 AM
stations, both religious :).  Facepiece is in great condition; out of a
cherry '71single cab
3. 2 Brand new chrome round EMPI style air cleaners with paper filters #
00-9076-0 (are these for a bug?)
4.  1984 camper supplement to Vanagon owners manual- a small booklet showing
how to use all the goodies. I pd $3 for it &quot;on spec&quot; :)
5.  0231174011 distributor, no points or cap, (dual vacuum).
6.  Older Bosch coil
7.  2 Good condition headlight rims

For Sale items: (I pd for these._dot_usually at quite a bit higher price) :(
1.  Bentley for 68-79, brand new, in the wrapper, $10
2.  2 headlights and headlight buckets PN 211941046. Buckets say &quot;Hella&quot;,
bulbs say GE. $5 each.
3.  Complete, excellent condition 009 distributor/ With
rotor/points/cap/condenser, etc.  $10
4.  Complete distributor 021905205P (single vacuum) $5

What I could use:

1. 2-part throttle-positioner for 70/71 1600 DP.
2. Both rear sidelights from the 74 era busses.
3. Reflectors behind doors of 68 era DC's.
4. Bows/tarps for both our DC and SC...crap..I can dream can't I?
