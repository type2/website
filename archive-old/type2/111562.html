Subject: Re: [T2] FI Idle mixture ?

Yes, lots of people.  They are called &quot;pedestrians&quot; or &quot;purchasers of
rebuilt engines.&quot; That is actually quite an overstatement, as the idle
mixture screw does not have much effect at other than idle and few people
spend enough time there to destroy an engine.  At the same time, it is
impossible to adjust properly without an exhaust gas analyzer.  Every shop
has one and any hlf-kindly mechanic will plug it in and twiddle the
adjustment screw for $25 or less IF THAT IS ALL IT NEEDS. The capital
letters are important. It is truly rare that there is a problem with the
idle mixture screw that is limited to the idle mixture screw.  Usually a
suspected problem with idle mixture is actually a problem with the
ignition, valves, or vacuum. If they are fine, then the problem is still
more likely with an injector.  Once the ignition is perfect, the valves
are perfect, the vacuum is tight and the injector flow patterns are
balanced THEN it is time to twiddle the idle mixture adjustment screw.

                             OOK!
