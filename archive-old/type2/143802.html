Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] Tune-up Freq with Bruck 205; Bosch Qual Decl

Good questions, Karl &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;.  
     
Q: How does the bus die?:  
A: What happens is the bus begins to cough and choke
during operation, and run poorly.  It degenerates with
the more miles I put onto it.  It always idles well,
but looses the ability to run dependably at freeway
speeds, and has little or no power going up hills.  My
maint records indicate a few as 6 or 7 tankfulls of
gas and the rough running sets in.  During a couple of
long weekends in April, the coughing and rough running
problem was onset WHILE ON THE TRIPs, requiring
Tune-ups remotely.
     
Q: Do I replace all of the parts?  
A:  No.  Cap, rotor, points, condensor, and spark
plugs correct the problem for another 1500 miles.  Now
I did try once changing only the cap and rotor, but
squeezed-out only about 100 miles.  I have determined
the most important component that needs to be replaced
are the spark plugs.  Bosch W7CC.
     
Q:  What is going wrong with the parts I'm
replacing. 
A:  The Cap/rotor shows significant accumulation of
green Cupric Oxide.  Based upon say, the 30,000 Mile
Tune-up Volvo cap condition, or the 100,000 Mile
Tune-up Chevrolet cap condition, the VW cap is well
on its way to oblivion in 1200 miles.  I still have
several failed caps and rotors, but no spark plugs. 
Can send photos.  Also, the Spark Plugs come out
looking virtually new.  They are not sooty, or brown
dusted, or different from cylinder to cylinder or
wet with oil or anything like that.  However replacing
the Spark Plugs Cap &amp; Rotor solves the problem.  !?
   
Q:  Was the 009 with Accu-Fire getting more miles? 
A:  Yes, at least 3 or 4 times the number of miles.  I
am at work and don't have the maintenance figures
in-front of me, but the 009 with Accu-Fire was being
tuned-up in the 5000 to 10,000 mile range (from
memory).
     
My Volvo gets tuned-up annually.  It's plugs, cap, &amp;
rotor get replaced annually, but are not in
replaceable condition; they are all new looking.  I
always use Bosch for the Volvo; high quality,
dependable, and the parts look good coming out of
the vehicle.  89 B230 LH-Jetronic.  The Volvo cap with
50,000 miles is in better condition than the VW Cap
with 1500 miles.
   
My bus had it's lower-end hand-rebuilt several years
ago.  I was not the owner at that time.  It has
perhaps 40,000 on the bottom end.  I have had 5
different pairs of heads however, as the first 4 pair
were being destroyed due to a large engine sheet metal
rust hole, which allowed the engine to aspirate hot
air.  But that problem has been solved, and the
current Portugese heads, purchased new from
www2.CIP1_dot_com have performed flawlessly. 
VWC-039-101-061-M.
    
I don't know if this is important, but while connected
to the dwell/rpm meter during tune-ups, the engine is
set to run at 950 RPM.  When I turn-on the heater
blower, the engine RPM drops to 865.  Every time, like
clockwork.  I do not have a hard-start relay wired-in,
but suspect that would solve the problem.
   
In the last 5 years, have replaced Air-Flow Sensor,
injectors, cold-start injector, fuel hoses, heads,
gaskets always are replaced, and the hydraulic
valves are stable, having been tightened 2 revolutions
after first touching.  Oil changes, air filter, fuel
filter are religiously changed.  New muffler.  New
Bosch Blue coil.  We have confirmed the coil is wired
correctly.  Even the fuel injection harness has been
replaced.  The replacement FI Harness was used, but
was replaced nonetheless.
   
I have never replaced the brain.
   
The air flaps were removed a couple of years ago, and
I haven't take the time or $$ to have them re-added. 
I.E. The engine has no thermostat.
    
I would consider a FI system upgrade to a California
model with use of an oxygen sensor.  The &quot;Oxygen
feed-back loop&quot; design is superior to my 78 system,
as the brain is allowed to tightly control the
mixture.

   
What are your thoughts?

&gt; &gt; Q1:  Why am I getting &lt; 1500 miles per tune-up
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  ...... is only getting only 1200 to 1500 miles
&gt; per
&gt; &gt; Tune-up.  A tune-up includes hardware cap / rotor
&gt; /
&gt; &gt; spark plugs / points.  Was using 009 before with
&gt; &gt; AccuFire, and got a couple of thousand miles per
&gt; &gt; tune-up.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Parts used:
&gt; &gt; Bruck (Germany) VWC-043-905-205
&gt; &gt; Spark Plugs BOS-W7CC.   Tried BOS-W8CC once, not a
&gt; &gt; big
&gt; &gt; diff.
&gt; &gt; Cap BOS-1-235-522-056
&gt; &gt; Rotor BOS-1-234-332-215
&gt; &gt; Points BOS-1-237-013-044
&gt; &gt; Cond BOS-1-237-330-220
&gt; &gt; Replaced the Bosch wires with a set of BOS-09171
&gt; &gt; late
&gt; &gt; last year (2004).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm trying to use quality stuff.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am a little puzzled.  Are you needing to replace
&gt; &gt; ALL those parts every 1200 to 1500 miles?!?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Exactly what is going wrong with them?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cap and rotor and plug wires on my 77 Westy have
&gt; &gt; over 200,000 miles on them. I change the Bosch
&gt; plugs
&gt; &gt; every 
&gt; &gt; 60K to 75K just because, and no, they are not
&gt; &gt; Platinums, just W8CC's. The only non stock
&gt; ignition
&gt; &gt; I run is 79 
&gt; &gt; Cal Bosch electronic ignition.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bosch ignition parts on Mercedes also go 200K to
&gt; &gt; 300K all the time.
