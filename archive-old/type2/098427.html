Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder head temp sensor

&gt; Greetings --
&gt;
&gt; To make a long story short, my cylinder head temp sensor threads on
&gt; the head are shot...

Yup, from the description, they are indeed shot.

There are two ways to deal with this, the right way and the quick way.

The right way:  find and install a 10x1.0 helicoil (good luck!) or have
the hole filled with weld, redrilled, and tapped.

The quick way: unless you have an original engine, check the mirror
location at the rear of cylinder #4.  Many rebuiders drill and tap that
hole for a CHT sender, since they cannot be sure which side a replacement
head will be used on.  If it is drilled and tapped, you can put the CHT
sender there.  It's not as good as putting it on #3, but it will work.

If it were me, I'd go with the quick way if it were available.  Check your
head.  You will also need a slight extension on the sire to it from the
harness, I believe.

If you want to take a bit more time, there is a second tin screw
location to the rear of the original location, but still near #3.  You can
also drill and tap that hole for the sender.  A better solution, but more
time/effort.

&gt; I am not 100% sure that the new(used) sensor is okay, because I get
&gt; very erratic readings from the ohmmeter, but I also think that it's
&gt; possible that it's not properly seated, because the readings fluctuate
&gt; when I touch the wire coming from the sensor....

Altho it sounds like your major problem is lack of contact, any used
sender is pretty much guaranteed to be bad.  For some reason, these seem
to go bad every couple years, at least for me.  Since we need to get
emissions checked here in VA every other year, I just replace mine before
I bring it in.  I would *not* recommend using other than a new sender.

&gt; When the engine is cold, it starts easily and idles a
&gt; little too fast.  As the engine warms during a drive
&gt; around the block, it begins to run very rough, idling
&gt; poorly, and then dies.  When the engine cools, it'll
&gt; start right back up.  It's not really a question of
&gt; what's causing the problem, it's what's the best way
&gt; to solve the problem without buying a new head just
&gt; for the temp sensor fitting.  Is it because steel
&gt; epoxy has poor heat and/or electrical conductivity and
&gt; is giving a false reading to the AFM?

Yup!  You need good contact and epoxy is a plastic.  *NOT* a good
conducter.  The symptoims you describe are classic for a bad sender *or*
bad contact.

&gt; About ten minutes after the engine got to a
&gt; temperature that exceeded the temp sensor (the engine
&gt; died), the reading on the sensor was 750 ohms.  The
&gt; sensor to the tough was very warm, but depending on
&gt; the ground, the reading fluctuated between 350 and 750
&gt; ohms.  Touching the wire that comes from the sensor
&gt; would swing it to infinity.

If you want to know, take the sender inside, heat up a pan of oil with a
candy theromometer in it and conduct your tests in a valid environment.
Iffy ground and maybe temps are making a hash of your readings, I am sorry
to say, and I can't tell you what is going on, tho I will stand by my
&quot;Toss it, buy a new one&quot; advice above.
