Subject: mystery wire?  

78 westy......  There is a wire attached to the front of the motor above the
tin on the passenger side. It goes through the case right behind the flywheel.
It has about 18&quot; of wire on it and a three pronged plug attached to the end.
What is this?  what does it do?  Can I remove it?

thanks

dan
