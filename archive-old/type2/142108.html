Subject: Warning : What a bad clutch driven plate will do to your bus

Just a couple of observations from a layman regarding the pressure plate. Firstly the 
driven plate is not rigidly located like the flywheel, so when your clutch is released 
there is nothing to stop it being slighly off center with the flywheel. So if my 
understanding is correct regarldess of how well balanced it is, once it's off center with 
the flywheel it will be out of balance anyway.
Secondly, my 2L manual was fully re-co'ed (engine + trans) ~40k miles ago including 
new PP and only did minor balancing myself (pistons &amp; rods) I left the rest. With my 
motor idling there is a faint but noticable vibration through the whole bus which 
disapears when the clutch is depressed. I assume this is unbalance from the pressure 
plate which stops spinning soon after the clutch is depressed. I doubt it's unbalance 
from the input shaft of the trans.
