Subject: Computer spark plugs

Hi group

Went to Autozone for a set of platinum spark plugs. They consulted their 
computer and came upn with the Bosch standard WR8CP and the Bosch Super W8CC 
kind. The counter lady said the super duty is for &quot;trailer towing&quot;
I don't tow trailers, but plan to do some mountain driving, will there be a 
benefit in getting the heavy duty kind, if so what's the advantage? Or the 
difference for that matter?
Archives do not clarify but add that Platinums have no advantage over OEM 
plugs.
What's a dummy to believe?
Please deconfuse me
