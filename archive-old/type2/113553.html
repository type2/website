&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, I change it myself.  It would be hard to justify 6000 mile 
&gt;&gt;&gt;intervals if you're being ripped off at $30 a pop.
&gt;&quot;Boy, talk about cheap. That's $15 for the lube, $5 for equipment 
&gt;financing, $5 for rent and utilities, and $5 for the mechanic and owner to 
&gt;share. What assholes they are to not go bankrupt so you won't call them 
&gt;rip offs. If you had a reasonable equipped shop to service T-II's 
&gt;properly, how much would you charge??? How much extra if the baby needs 
&gt;new shoes, too, over and above the business overhead???&quot;
&gt;
&gt;In the first place, they are not paying $15 for 5+ pints of gear oil.
&gt;If they are, they deserve to go out of business for stupidity.
&gt;
&gt;Second, the needs of their baby have nothing to do with the value of the 
&gt;product or service they are offering.
&gt;
&gt;Third, it is common practice to put up a big banner offering $12.95 oil 
&gt;changes,

Indeed, that's the come on. Then they find the bad shocks, which are 
actually 30 year old stock Boge's still in good order, and remove them and 
throw them away and sell the cheapest Monroe SUPER DUTY jobs that are crap 
and they make twice the margin on. Can you say SSCCCAAAAAMMMMMMMMM.


&gt;including 5 quarts of oil and a filter.  The same place will then charge 
&gt;$29.95 for a transmission oil change.  Excuse me for seeing 2.5 quarts of 
&gt;gear oil, no filter, and less labor, at more than twice the price, as a 
&gt;rip-off.

I agree, they rip you off. That's there job. Do you think that since they 
con you in with a loss leader that they are going to take a loss on all 
other &quot;services&quot; too?? If you do, you need a 2x4 between the ears. They are 
indoctrinated to sell the image of value without giving any value in fact. 
That's the point. They prey upon YOUR attitude with the loss leader 
service, and you bite. Otherwise, they would be bankrupt in a month. Damn 
them for ripping off the willing idiots and fools of the world. How big a 
stack of quicky lube invoices do you have in the glove box???? An &quot;80 
point&quot; checklist inspection at the quicky lube has nothing to do with a 
proper maintenance inspection. Go play computer games if you can't figure 
out reality.


&gt;Finally, I just threw $30 out there as an example.  Maybe they are 
&gt;charging $40, $50, or even $100 where you live.  Does it change the point 
&gt;I was making?

True, they prey upon the ignorance of car owner's, pump their egos, sell 
them a bill of goods, take a large margin on junk designed to be cheap, and 
are a successful charlatan businesses. Haven't you heard, in this 
relativistic society, it matters not how you get the money, it's THAT you 
get the money, however, that is the measure of success. It is no wonder 
that the king of charlatans got elected twice and claimed the successes of 
his priors as his, then left a mess for others to rectify.

It is the difference between values by logic, and values by assumption. 
Which do you think will result in more money in your pocket??? Act accordingly.

Reletively speaking on social values lost on the masses, which is you and 
everyone like you that see all your problems created and founded in others, 
and you are without sin, a hapless victim in your own mind.
