Subject: [T2] Sliding Door Curtain, 71 Westy

there is a rail attached to the
&gt; bus (not the window) above the window with little sliding plastic

There is also a strap at the B pillar to
&gt; secure the curtain when it is not in use.  There is also a small hook
&gt; on the cabinet that grabs a plastic ring that is sewn to the curtain
&gt; when the curtain is extended.

Man you are awesome.  I saw this earlier.  Your spec's are right on,
down to the little hook on the closet.  How many little plastic
pieces?   :)
I counted because I am trying to figure how to utilize them.  My idea,
grommets in the fabric, and maybe a small &quot;s&quot; hook wrapped around the
little plastic slider..  Problem, haven't found an &quot;s&quot; hook smaller than
3/4 &quot;.  I found some cool little grommets in the craft area of Wal
Mart.  I did see some little clips in the fishing tackle area, I
considered them.  Any more ideas?
Thanx again.  Its always a pleasure dealing with PROS!
