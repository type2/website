Subject: Re: [VB] Fool's Fest campout 

I totally agree!!!! when I was a kid we had a 62 bus... I could stand up in 
it and that was the coolest!!!   My family went camping a lot.   the beaches 
and mountains and deserts, and day trips in the spring to see the wildflowers in 
bloom on the hills like God painted them with watercolours.  Even after we 
traded in the bus for a old chevy station wagon, we went camping... to Baja with 
the heat turned up in the 55 chevy so the engine didn't overheat and we're 
hanging out the windows going over salt flats,  or towing the hobie cat to a 
lake in the Sierras, etc.

VW traveling and camping has to be one of the best things a parent can do
for their kids in my opinion.  A number of my best memories were of camping
and I hope Rachel will have these times to look back on too.  It is so
relaxing to be around friends while camping, much better than just going out
on your own.
