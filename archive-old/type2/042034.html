Subject: cooling system-type4

have a question about the cooling flaps and how
they work on a type4 engine.

I think the flaps are installed right but how they
work doesnt make much sense to me.
When I'am looking at the flaps from overhead with the
oil cooler on the left....
the right flap is down and the right flap is up.
When the thermostat expands the right flap opens
more and the left flap goes down covering up the
oil cooler(if its open all the way). Whats the
point of the oil cooler if no air is blowing through
it? I restalled everything the way it was when I
took it apart can anyone explain how the system works?

thanks
alex,
77 Riviera... 79'2L engine
