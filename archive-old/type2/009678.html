Subject: More cots!
Message-ID: &lt;19990603180532.16477.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

It's kinda fun having a day off in the middle of the week. I get to have 
first pick at the yards, instead of going on Saturday when it's crowded and 
picked over.

I found a complete 72 Westy. I grabbed the upper cot and the 
over-the-front-seat cot. It even had a complete 67 and back cot in it! 68-72 
cot bars are 56 1/4&quot; long and 3 sided. Split window cot bars are also 56 
1/4&quot; but they are round tubes painted black.
Sorry, all the grey handles were gone.
I also got the large white table that hangs on the drivers wall.

I still have a upper cot with no canvas...$10
Complete upper cot...$25
Front cot 68-72...$15
Front cot up to 67...$15
I also have 1 set of 73-75 bars [57 1/4&quot;, you could use them on 76-79 but 
you would have no where to store them]
The canvas is the same on all years. If someone wants the bars alone....$10  
or I can trade them for the 56 1/4&quot; bars and you would have a complete cot.
1 set of 56 1/4&quot; bars.....$10
Large white table....$15

I'm still in Fresno, Cal.  &amp; ups is extra :)
