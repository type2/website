Subject: Poptop canvas &amp; engines

Hey all,

I remember a long thread around christmas about PLFVW.  Does anyone have
current info to share?  I want to get a new 3 window cavas for my westy
this spring &amp; I would like to get some suggestions on recent experience.

Does Poptops make a good product?
anyone else??
Who is the source for tops out of RMMW, JC whitney, and Bus Depot??
Time is kind of an issue - I can order it immediately, but I need to get
it w/in 4 wks so that I will have time to put in in before a trip the
1st week of may.

2nd topic - I would like some recent experience info w/ AVP.  I am
planning on getting a 2liter hyd. long block from them.  I have searched
the archives for some info, but would like anything else.  I have
e-mailed to AVP, and a friend who owns a local VW shop sugggests them..
However, he also suggests that they put in a new camshaft and balance
the rods and pistons, which is not there standard procedure. An info /
suggestions / experience??

thanks
michael
