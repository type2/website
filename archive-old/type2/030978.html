&gt; boot. Engine is an oily mess headed for the engine bath. So I'm in the 
&gt; market for a new set of cylinders and pistons for my 1978 auto tranny 
&gt; 2.0 L Westy. 94mm, dished piston, part no. 029-198-075.
&gt; 
&gt; The Bus Depot sells Cofab parts. So does The Volks Cafe in Santa Cruz. So
&gt; do just about all the parts ads I see in the various VW mags. I'm told
&gt; Cofab is a Mahle factory in Brazil, run by Mahle and making heads to Mahle
&gt; specs. A local mechanic I have some confidence in tells me I should 
&gt; insist on only real german Mahle (or Kolbenschmidt, if I can get 'em) 

I heard all the same, finally found a set of Mahle pistons for the 2 liter
engine at &quot;Peek Performance&quot; in Seabrook MD.  They told me I got thier
last set as they were no longer avaliable.  I paid $350 for em. no regrets

&gt; Then there's price to consider: german Mahle $400-$480, Cofab $230-$270. 

a couple bucks maybe, that much tells you something

&gt; I want the best for my bus since I'm driving it for the long term and I 

same here, mines also a 78 with an Auto tranny

&gt; I want current opinions on how good current parts are. Should I spend the 
&gt; extra bucks for german Mahle cylinders and pistons? I'll gladly spend 
&gt; more for better quality, but don't want to burn needless cash.

my money went into the search and the Mahle's.  both my most trusted
mechanic friends, and the guy doing the bottom end for me all said &quot;Mahle&quot;
maybe I threw money away but I have no regrets on this one.
