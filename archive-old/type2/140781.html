Subject: Re: [T2] front brake trouble

100% for sure, you need to replace the brake flex hoses. They're plugged, 
plus the brakes need to be checked out too while replacing them.

I've got a '74 (discs on front). Whenever I brake,
there seems to be a definite pull to the right.
Yesterday (suddenly, never happened before), I jammed
the brakes fairly hard, not a panic stop, but I was
testing them a bit. The right front seemed to &quot;lock
up&quot;, squealing the tire. Did this twice. I'm not too
hep on brakes, so what would cause this behavior? What
should I be looking for?

While I'm posting, any suggestions (brand, size, etc.)
for an auxiliary batt setup? I've got the relay and
have a firm grasp on the wiring scheme. I would mostly
be running a laptop PC. thanks on both counts!
