Subject: Petronix Electronic Ignition

I'm installing an electronic Petronix ignition into my vacuum advance
distributor.  After I seat the magnetic sleeve onto the distributor shaft the
rotar doesn't fit into it's assigned slot.  Has anyone experienced this
condition?  I followed the instructions step by step.  I don't believe the
magnetic sleeve will seat further onto the distributor shaft?
