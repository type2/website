Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Shore Power&quot; to charge 2nd Battery

If you talk to the &quot;battery experts&quot; they will tell you it's not a good idea
to charge your camping battery with the engine.  The reason being after a
night of camping, your battery will be pretty well drained and the voltage
regulator will kick the alternator into high gear giving the battery a high
charge which can boil the battery pretty quick.

The best way to charge a low battery is slowly with a trickle charger.  The
Scamp that I pull with my '76 westy has an on board charger that can tell
when the battery is full so it doesn't overcharge.

The best way in my opinion would be to use a large solar panel on the roof
and charge on the go or while camping, I have seen this setup on a couple
westies and it works great.

&gt; So I have installed my Hella second battery relay and it works like a
&gt; charm, charging the battery while I drive sailboats, plug my
&gt; bus in and have the &quot;shore&quot; power charge my accessory battery when I
&gt; have access to a power outlet. Has anyone got any  experience or
&gt; thoughts on this ?
