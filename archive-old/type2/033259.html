Content-Disposition: inline

When I had my 71 apart, I checked the continuity of my rear defroster grid only
to confirm what I already knew, totally open. When you looked closely at the
traces, you could see where time and the sun had thinned or remover parts of the
grid. A quick call to the local VW parts supplier showed that there were two
rear glass pieces available, with the grid installed, in the entire US.
Price......$369!!! Ouch. At that point I decided that the glass looked pretty
good and it cleaned up really nice. What the heck, I decided to try to repaint
the grid lines. I did them one at a time and masked them off as carefully as I
could to maintain an equal spacing. Talk about a major PITA!!! Anyway, when I
was done, it came out looking pretty good. If you looked close, you could see
some feathering where the paint had crept under the tape, but all in all, not
bad. I did use the narrowest brush I could find and I tried to put on multiple
coats. I think one bottle of stuff did the whole thing, might have been two
(it's been a couple of years.) Don't know if it works yet but according to the
ohm meter I have good continuity across the grid now. If anyone knows what the
stock resistance is suppose to be, I guess I can compare and see how close it
came. Haven't got to try it out yet but, at best it works, at worst, it still
looks better than it did.
