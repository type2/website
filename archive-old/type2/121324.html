Subject: Re: [T2] aftermarket starter?

&gt;Hey all-
&gt;
&gt;I have a stock 77 bus that is starting to develop a worn out starter. 
&gt;Anyone have any practical experience with after market starters that claim 
&gt;to be much more robust (&quot;high troque&quot;)- than the original? Are there still 
&gt;original Bosch starter out there or are they reman?

Find an authorized Bosch supplier. The Bosch catalog for ReMan/NewMan 
rotating electric will show the stock and any alternate units for your 
application. Cross you fingers and hope it shows the SR17X as suitable for 
your year engine. It is listed for earlier T-IV motors and is the stock 
unit used in the Porsche 911. Otherwise, there are probably alternates with 
higher output listed.


&gt;The aftermarket one I am *considereing* is IMI or Tilton- they ain't cheep 
&gt;though!

No one in the after market makes a more robust starter at anything like the 
price of genuine article specifically manufactured to fit right.

&gt;My understanding is that the Bosch starters are kinda weak design-

What evidence do you have of Bosch weaknesses??? I can't tell you how many 
of them I have seen over 30 years old and still function nominal. Rarely do 
I replace one less than 20 years old. I've pulled a bunch of no-name remans 
that sure didn't have the appearance of being more than a few years old.
