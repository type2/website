No, I do know that Bob.  Weddle can modify a LockRight for $350 for the
late autobox ('75 or '76 onto Vanagon) but I've had drastically conflicting
reports from people I trust about whether you want a locker or not for
normal driving.  Noise and profound understeer if you punch it in the corner.
The ZF is less noise and less intrusive on handling but still shows
similar characteristics.  But with ground clearance and one of these for
normal foolishness should make a Bus/Van unstoppable.  Now for the
stuff Derek and the boys do, well sometimes you got to be 4WD.
