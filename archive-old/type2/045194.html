Bill -

Hi &amp; thanks, especially for the stop-in offer.  Well, went through OK (cut 
due North fm Dumas, TX), but through &quot;no man's land&quot; (Cimmaron strip?), 
stopped in Boise for breakfast _at_ Sheen's.

About that exhaust leak:  any pointers on where I can start?  I'm really 
quite clueless as to where the exhaust is entering in to the heating/vent 
system.  I know this exhaust isn't making its way above the tin &amp; into the 
cabin from the rear deck lid.  I can actually see smoke coming from my front 
vents, increases as I increase RPM (especially when stopped).  I don't think 
the smoke is the result of burning oil, but who knows?  I'm joyful/grateful 
to have the option of working on my Westy in the snow! - don't know how 
people live without it ;)

I'm gonna post this to the list, as well, see what folks think.  The point 
I'm at right now, I can't really afford to repl. the heat exchangers as a 
first step, although I have a feeling they're part of the problem.  Can you 
explain/know where I can find out about the exchanger's functionality?  I've 
a very vague idea, but that doesn't help me in my situation.  My gut feeling 
also tells me there may be a problem w/the heater flaps, but I don't imagine 
exhaust should even be making its way that far forward.

TIA &amp; keep cool,

Mark

congrats on making it home.

Get the exhaust leak fixed before you forget it. No fun working on it in the
future snow!
