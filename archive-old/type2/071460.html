Subject: New Westy Won't start
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

This morning my newly acquired '77 Westy started right up, no problem. Couple 
of hours later, after I had moved my Bug out of the garage, I went to move 
the Westy. It started, I drove about 15 feet, it died. Since then it will 
turn over, start sometimes and run for 3-4 seconds, then die. Occasionally it 
gives a muffled backfire. My old '76 had a carb, and this one is fuel 
injected (as the '76 should have been). What to check first? One other thing, 
the passenger side door is pretty eaten up with rust, but that didn't bother 
me too much because I have a good passenger door off a '76- jokes on me, VW 
changed the hinges from 76 to 77! Anyone want to trade a '77 pass. side door 
for one from a '76?   Thanks, Jeff S.
