&gt;does anyone know if the left side is left hand thread like splits and bays?
&gt;Or are both sides right hand thread? If both are right hand, I believe
&gt;Mercedes split clamps will work on a Vanagon....they are half the thickness

All vanagon spindles use the same right hand thread nut on both sides
as I've indicated.  The bay clamp does work, but as Karl notes sticks
out WAY to far to fit under stock hubs, and may not clamp effectively
as the part where it screws down isn't on a thread engaged portion.

Steve needs to quit whining and put the stock nuts on correctly already,
but this is a place where VW took a big step back as far as ease of
serviceability goes.
