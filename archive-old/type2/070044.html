Subject: hard starting when warm('71 westy)

howdy!
 I just got back online and bought that camper I've been eyeing, and
now as expected I have questions upon questions...Thanks in advance, 
let me know if you folks get tired of my dumb questions. :)
 I had to put another engine in her for now to get her moving, and I 
can't quite seem to iron all of the bugs. The major problem would be
this: I go to start up in the morning and all is well, half a crank
on the key and it fires up and idles smoothly, but after running for
a while and warming up, she won't start. If I let it sit for a while, 
then she'll fire up okay, but not immediately. The engine in question
is a 1500cc with a 30pict3 carb and a mechanical type distributor. (I 
plugged up the vacuum hoses from the carb. Hopefully well enough) I 
checked the valve adjustment this morning before running as when she 
gets warmed the engine tends to miss some but all seems good there. 
.006 all around. Also, the choke seems to be functioning properly. 
Those were my two best guesses. Any sugestions?

Thanks again,
Matt
