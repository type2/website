Subject: [T2] Neat stuff for the Cumberland RI VW Show

I'll be bring a truckload of Stuff to the swap at the RI show on Sunday
September 3rd..

Possibly a couple Bus Roof racks

Maybe a clean Panel cab divider

And a fair set of Hurst bumpers (front and rear)...

Most of this stuff will be on consignment from a LONG time collector who
is retiring to FL in a year or so...

Look for a big white Chevy 2500 with Mr. Bubbleheads in the rear window
(This is my &quot;Official A.I.R.S. tow vehicle&quot;)..

See ya'll there....
