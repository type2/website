Subject: Re: [T2] Fri--What is it with the dead?

G. Simmons sends:

&gt; So what is interesting about the greatful dead, and what is their connection
&gt; to busses?

Fan relations. There were, IMO, two people who really understood what it
takes to develop and maintain a fan base--Jerry Garcia and Dale Earnhardt.
Earnhardt is a subject for another time.

The Grateful Dead did everything right. They charged decent prices for their
concerts. They allowed people to set up little bazaars (where you could sell
anything EXCEPT Grateful Dead merchandise) right inside the gates. They
didn't shake people down for cameras and tape recorders--you could even plug
your tape recorder into the console for the very highest quality recordings.
Far from being &quot;free and open,&quot; it was all very shrewd marketing. Garcia
knew that people who traded Grateful Dead cassettes also bought Grateful
Dead albums. (I don't know what he would have thought of Napster. I'm not
sure he would have approved.) People who bought Dead music also bought Dead
clothes and Dead paraphernalia--both drug and other--and talked other people
into buying Dead stuff.
