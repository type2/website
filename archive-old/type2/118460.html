Had the problem as I did what you do on the Vanagon list. Replay and leave
the messageon. It's sometimes anoying when you see a gazillion replays to
the same message but thats life. People are sometimes to lazy to delete not
required repleys, but to get kicked out or the replay doesn't went through
because the admin stppodit and send the ame message back to you seems a bit
harsh. I once was kicked as I send a warning about e-bay fraud. Learned it
the hard way not to do this or warn the listees about a computer virus. For
sure we have to have rules, but rules are also made to bend them for some
( in MOP) reasons.
