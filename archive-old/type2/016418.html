     Your biggest probability for vacuum leaks is the brake servo hose. My '73
drove me nuts until I finally replaced most sections of it, *AND* put a good
strong hose clamp on the manifold end along with a bit of RTV on the inside. Try
pulling the servo hose and putting a cork in the manifold. Also test the one-way
valve in the hose. If plugging the manifold helps, don't forget that the servo
itself can leak.
