Subject: KILLER EGR

Sad to say the 1977 model year T2s are saddled with a  primitive  smog  
control system that unless it is very well maintained  can cause major 
engine damage.

A blocked or leaky EGR system  is the major culprit.

A blocked EGR system can not provide the cooling  inert gas needed to 
prevent  or reduce, that engine killer, combustion  chamber detonation. Some 
owners block the EGR but as a rule the EGR blocks itself after two or so 
years of use. Blocks of crud form in the filter, the valve, and the air 
distributor.

A leaky EGR system increases the air/fuel ratio  which  can also push the 
engine into combustion  chamber detonation.  The EGR valve seal tends to 
leak and the filter rusts out letting air in.

The tune up requirement that the exhaust gas into the catalytic converter 
contain  1% CO puts a tough  requirement on long term drift in  the fuel 
injection  system.  If it drifts lower than 0.5 %, combustion  chamber 
detonation is again a major problem. This is made even worse with a blocked  
or leaky EGR system.

In addition  by design the EGR valve blocks at idle to avoid rough idle.  It 
also blocks  at full throttle (where detonation  is most likely) to provide 
for an extra power boost at this throttle setting  (for passing?).

Developments such as lambda control, anti-knock detectors, and ECU timing 
advance control help keep later models out of these trouble even when 
running at low CO content.
