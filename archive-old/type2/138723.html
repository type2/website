Subject: RE: lost ignitiion key

Use of a dent puller will probably result in damage to the entire casting.  
I sure wouldn't go that way.  As others have mentioned, disassembly differs 
by year.  Assuming that your bus was a single-key model, as it was when new, 
pull another lock, get the code, and a key can be generated.  We'll be glad 
to help if you can give a bit more info.
