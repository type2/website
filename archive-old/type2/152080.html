&gt; Not trying to bash you just a few observations...

&gt; &quot;and sometimes better is not better,,,...for many of us who don't like the
&gt;  latest and greatest, or have slow connections, or maybe accessing from a
&gt;  PDA or cell phone.  fancy is not easier to use.  there really needs to be
&gt;  a basic button.  for text only and fast downloading...&quot;

yes, text sites are for more than cell phones, slow connections, rural
areas, older operating systems, adaptive equipment, a veriety of reasons,
enough for the gov to require it on all of their sites

&gt; had any luck with anything other then really basic mostly text sites that
&gt; are specifically designed for cellphones.
&gt;
&gt; Do other auto parts stores offer really basic / text only versions of their
&gt; websites?

yes
&gt;
&gt; If your stuck on the side of the road with an 3G internet browser cellphone
&gt; IMO your probably much better off just having BD's phone number in your
&gt; phonebook and calling them! Browsing the net on a phone is an exercise in
&gt; frustration. That's what laptop cellphone connection cords are for.

true, but at the cost of cellphone internet airtime, you want something
that loads super fast, and that is text
&gt;
&gt; &quot;so 99% of the time I make a long distance phone call to waste Ron's
&gt;  employee's time answering my questions and getting the right part.  but at
&gt;  least I get the part and I get it fast.  just as long as Ron remembers
&gt;  that his business is selling top line VW parts at fair prices I don't care
&gt;  what else he does...&quot;
&gt;
&gt; It's called customer service and making a sale, I doubt Ron considers that a
&gt; waste of his employees time. That's why he has a phone number after all. ;-)

and his employees are top notch, but time is money, I could look up and
know what I was calling for or if it were avaliable before hand and save
time.
