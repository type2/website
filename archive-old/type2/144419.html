Unfortunately, the current Oregon governor is planning to veto the
recently passed emissions legislation so he can pass
Califonia-duplicate legislation here. I guess he subscribes to the Maj.
Burns (M*A*S*H reference) philosophy of &quot;independent thinking is fine
as long as we all do it together&quot;. Apparently, there's some kind of
push to get the CA law into Washington as well. There goes the
neighborhood.

I'm parting out / selling the original '72 westy interior, now that the
'78 is in. Anyone interested in hardware, or the z-bed or whatever,
lemme know. Some of it is listed on theSamba, but I'll discount / take
a BO from a listee. least I can do for the advice you've all provided
over the last few years.
