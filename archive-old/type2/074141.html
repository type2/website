Subject: Re: Double Cab Canvas

Just to answer a lot of questions--Dawn, of Phoenix is NOT making this
product. If you have any complaints about Dawn--Please do not send them to
me--The people producing the canvas for my 1960DC, may have a point about
dealing with some VW people--Since I posted this--Now I'm getting e-mail
blasting me,and other VW People. I felt really good about finding a deal on
a canvas for my DC and passing it on to others--Now I have my doubts about
trying to help--
