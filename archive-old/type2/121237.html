Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Insurance , Company ?

If you have a Westy, I suggest you check out Good Sam, which insures
RV's using National General as their carrier-(Yes, A Westy is an RV)
I've good luck with them; they will cover all your cars-We have 2
busses, a Hyundai, an old Nissan Quest, and now, A Subaru Forester with
them... When we added our 18 yr old daughter as a driver the increase
was very reasonable.  And this is in NJ, where covertage is tough to
find.  We have only comprehensive on the busses, Hyundai, and Quest,
which covers deer accidents also!
