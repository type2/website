Adam et al:
    Since this has come up a couple of times today, I checked Muir's book
itself wherein it is written:  &quot;Unless you live at the bottom of a hill,
don't warm up the engine sitting in the driveway. When the engine is cold,
raw gas washes away oil in the cylinders. Moderate driving will warm it up
faster.&quot; Chapter XX, verse 7 (How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive Forever). I
know that Muir himself advocates a short warm up period before driving at
least twice in the book, but he also says things and advocates certain
procedures that are simply wrong and even detrimental to your vehicle as
well (I'm not a professional mechanic, but even I know that the notch on the
distributor is not where the #1 cylinder fires). I said it earlier and I'll
say it again, Muir is great at outlining step by step procedures and giving
dolts like myself the confidence to work on my own vehicle, but Bentley is
the official service manual for VW busses. Together the two books can get
you through just about any problem, but if there is conflicting information,
I always follow Bentley over Muir.
Just my opinion,

Subject: Oil Cooler Question??


&gt; Hello Everyone...I was reading Muir's book last night a he mentioned a
&gt; particular oil cooler (called Rveeco) that is suppose to cool 100% of the
&gt; oil..as opposed to the stock oil coolers that only cool 30-40%...Any
thoughts
&gt; on Muir's subtle bias on oil coolers? Also...what is the deal on Warming
up
&gt; the engine...I have been following Muir's 3 minute idle warm up...is it a
&gt; waste of time? Going to finally get at my Brakes and Master Cylinder this
&gt; coming weekend...Thanks for the help..Adam
