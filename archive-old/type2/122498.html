&gt;&gt; I have seen many fabulous floors installed into buses. I would like to put

Depending on the humidity in your area......I used 1/4&quot; CDX plywood as a
replacement floor piece when I was installing some industrial carpeting.
For a hardwood floor you would want a thinner sub-floor &amp; probably CDX type
or a more water resistant plywood, depending on the amount of humidity in
your area.  Check your local home depot, Lowe's or whatever is in your area.
You also want to screw it down nice &amp; tight.  Another thing I did was to not
completely cover the floor underneath the Z-seat therefore allowing an area
for moisture to escape.
Regardless of what you use you want it to resist warping to the utmost
degree.
Hope that helps
