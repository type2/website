&gt;The  big problem with troubleshooting skills is the ability to start
&gt;with basics. I  still remember training from many years  ago in a military 
&gt;tech school for electronics.  The first week of actual 
&gt;equipment  troubleshooting was  not spent with our equipment but  by 
&gt;looking at things like bicycles, pumps, basic  house lamps, and  then 
&gt;at  a huge electronic power distribution system with  multiple power
&gt;sources.  on  a lamp start with  the most basic item like is it plugged 
&gt;in? is there power where it  is plugged in?   If  no  power where plugged 
&gt;in why are you trying to  change the bulb?  It  is the same
&gt;with a car/plane/rocket etc.

I went through the Navy Electrician's school and spent a week or so on the 
electronics side of things. Military schools were pretty good I thought. 
Learned lots.

Anyone that wants some adventure (or like me is just spinning your tires in 
life) give 'em a try. Not my &quot;bag&quot; but glad I gave 'em a few years.

VW content: sure wish I had a good Westy when I was in the Navy. Would have 
been nice to have a rolling &quot;home away from home&quot; when I needed a break 
from all the crew cuts and Navy gray!!! Unfortunately I did not realize 
this until I was out for a few years. Bought our Westy and a few weeks 
later smacked myself on the forehead when it all dawned on me!!! &quot;I coulda 
had a Westfalia!!!&quot; I spent my time in the Navy/Italy tinkering with Beetles.

Commercial over.
