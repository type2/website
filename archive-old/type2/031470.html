&gt;   I have often thought it would be a great idea to install a fuel valve

yup, great!  I have em on my bus and changed the fuel filter Fri in about
10 minutes with nary a drop spilled.  two brass ball valves one on each
fuel line (FI) great for removing the engine or changing fuel filters,
also extra security when leaving parked in ???? area, one I can reach
without going under car...if you know exactly where to reach
