Subject: Weird feeling in the rear
Message-ID: &lt;dd5d5791.244675e2_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi Everyone :) 
	My problem is quite strange and I am wondering if anyone can help me. 
About a month ago I put new wheel cylinders adn shoes on the rear of my 70 
Campmobile. Ever since then I feel this weird like &quot;shimmy&quot; I feels like it 
is from the rear. It never did it before I did the rear brakes. Did I 
over/under tighten the big nut on the rear? Or did something else break or 
something? I am wondering If anyone ever experienced this problem before. 
Thanks for your help . 
By the way this was my first rear brake job on my VW. I have done thousands 
on GM products but am new to the wonderful world of VW. 
PEACE :)

Brendan
