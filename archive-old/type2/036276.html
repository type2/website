Subject: '72/'73 Questions

Got some questions about specifics of the '72 to '73 model year changes.

First, did the bumper/body change occur at the exact change of the model
year, and if so when was this?  (I assume at the change of VIN#'s?)

Next, did the front rotor/caliper change occur at exactly the same time?

If the changes sort of phased in, is there the possibility of '73 Bus with '72
bumpers or visa versa, a possibility of early '73 Bus with early rotors, etc.

Any experience with the matter appreciated.
