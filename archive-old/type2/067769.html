&gt; &gt;ack ack ack ack! parts place is on the list! ack ack ack! don't order from
&gt; &gt;them unless you got the time and patience to put up with messed up orders.
&gt; &gt;probably one of the worst vw parts places to deal with as far as customer
&gt; &gt;service and accuracy in filling orders.
&gt;   
&gt;         I've ordered from them with no significant screwups.  (they once
&gt; forgot the tensioner pulley for a diesel timing belt)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;guess what? i bounced my first check that week.
&gt; 
&gt;         That can be a real pisser, particullary when you have a good reason
&gt; to feel that it was someone elses fault.  A suggestion, talk to your bank
&gt; about setting the account so that if a check is overdrawn it automaticly
&gt; gets taken out of a saving account. (then if that fails they claim that they
&gt; will tack it on any existing loan, I'll bet that they pick the one with the
&gt; highest intrest!)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;i was polite during my many calls to parts place. but they didn't seem to care
&gt; &gt;about my buisiness there and customer service actually was rude a couple of
&gt; &gt;times. i'll never do buisiness with them again. a totally bad experience.
&gt; 
&gt;         They've been polite to me, I don't work there and I'm not going to
&gt; try to appologise for them thow.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;now, i understand that any buisiness can mess up an order. but the i'm not
&gt; 
&gt;         Very true, It's often easier to remember when things went wrong.
&gt; Lets also try to name people when things go right (I'm lax in this area too)
&gt; i.e. I've had good luck with Import Parts Center in Medford OR (the owner is
&gt; currently restoreing a diesel westy)(legal stuff).
&gt; 
&gt;         Mostly, lets try not to slam every vender that appears on the list,
&gt; or none will.  This dosen't mean don't be honst.  Just try not to vent
&gt; grudges years after the fact, vent it when it happens.  
&gt; 
&gt;         Agin, no relation to Parts Place.  I just want to see more vendors
&gt; (good, bed , or somewhere in between) on the list.  But when someone does
&gt; screw op BLAST 'EM but blast 'em THEN.  (none of this should apply to
&gt; the,&quot;should I order from ...&quot;post, if someone asks a question, tell them
&gt; everything, both good and bad)
