Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat question

You don't need to go sticking coat hangers up your engine.  Just watch the
little arm on the rod.  When your engine's cold, it should poit towards the
front of the bus.  As it warms, it should point straight up, or a little to
the rear.  Pull the accellerator cable after it has idled for a couple of
minutes and you will probably see it move.  From what you say, you probably
have a good thermostat.  If it were bad it would be loose even when cold.



&gt; With the engine hot push a thin wire (coathanger) up through the openings
&gt; in your oil cooler.


&gt; I seriously doubt that you have a good thermostat
