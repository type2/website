&gt; If you can find a one piece ANSA muffler replacement, I suggest that
&gt; route.


Short of finding an unused one at a flea market, you won't find the Ansa
extractor. Believe me, I've searched all over the country (and even parts of
Europe), and even offered Ansa themselves a sizeable order if they would
bring it back into production.  No go.  (Incidentally, it wouldn't have fit
an aircooled Vanagon anyway; it had triangular flanges, for '75-78 bus.)

Your best bet for quality and durability is my stainless steel exhaust
system, which runs $179 complete.  This will outlast anything else by a huge
margin. However, it will not accept a catalytic converter or an egr filter.
Fits '72-74 bus, '79 bus, and aircooled Vanagon.  (Fits' 75-78 if heat
exchangers are changed.)
