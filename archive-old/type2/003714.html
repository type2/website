As a result of the torrential rain and subsequent flooding in Houston caused
by Tropical Storm Allison, our 1976 Westy, Daisy, has been totaled by our
insurance company. This is just our little tribute to her.

She's graced our family with her presence for over three years. She *NEVER*
let us down, stranded us anywhere, or complained at all during this time.
She got my wife and I to Ohio and back to Houston with out so much as a
hiccup, joined us for a great time at Busses by the Arch a couple of years
ago, and drove countless long, hot, flat, boring miles here locally in
Houston.

She changed our lives forever. She showed us how to slow down and notice
things that we would otherwise miss on the highways and in life. She
introduced us to some great people, including this wonderful list. She put
smiles on our faces every time we looked at her. She made total strangers
smile and talk to us, telling us stories of their previous exploits in a bus
&quot;so many years ago&quot;. She helped make us an air-cooled family.

She never complained when she sat for weeks without being started. Instead,
she would just roar to life when I needed her to the most; like when our
squareback had a dead battery and I was late to work, or the time my &quot;new&quot;
rabbit convertible leaked so bad I couldn't drive it, or when the 412 had
the fuel pump go out, she would start the first time every time. So when I
ran outside at 2:30am on June 9th, as water was approaching her tailpipe, I
started her. Neither of us knew that as I drove her up my driveway as far as
I could, that this short drive would be our last. As we watched the water
keep rising, our attention turned from trying to save Daisy to trying to
save our cats, furniture, even my new lawnmower. Although the cats are safe
and sound, there wasn't even a chance for the furniture or the new mower.

As the water receded Saturday morning, I could get a better idea of what
happened to our baby. Water halfway up her taillights. Water inside. Water
everywhere. Debris everywhere. A total mess. Although our squareback got a
little water in the engine, and both the square and the 412 got about two
inches of water inside them, they both pulled through the flood okay. They
are both back on the road. But Daisy is still silent, waiting now for a tow
truck to take her away from us.

Insurance was fair to us, more than fair. In fact, I got exactly $2.32 less
for her than I paid for her three years ago. But you can't put a price for
the kind of enjoyment and loyalty that she provided my family and my
friends. So it is with great sorrow that we have to say goodbye to her.

Thank you, Daisy, for what you've done for us. We will always love you.

Thank you, list, for being here.
