Subject: Trip Report: Southbound

Hey now,
     We're southbound. It's 5 August and I'm at Stuart Crossing waiting on
the others. I went ahead to find a parts bus reputed to be here, but someone
towed it away a few days ago. Oh well.
     We headed out of Inuvik on the afternoon of the 3rd. Had a late start
after an interview and photo op. with the local paper, and hit the Dempster
again. Southbound was much nicer after it had dried up. We doodled along,
took pictures, chatted on the CB and generally lazed along. Ran into Jack
Bateman and crew just past Fort McPherson, as they headed north, and they
brought along some real cool Top of the World buttons. It was really neat to
meet another listmember... Towards Eagle Plains things started to look nasty
however. 20-25 knot crosswinds picked up and big black clouds loomed
threateningly ahead. So, Bob Hoover, Sue, Doug Freeman and myself decided to
push on to Dawson City-we didn't want to slog through the mud again. Bob and
Sue were running on little sleep, so they stopped at Enginer Campground, once
they were out of the mountains, and I passed out in the back of the bus while
dad took the rest of the leg into Dawson. We arrived at the Klondike
Campground at about 7am, and passed out. 
     Shortly thereafter, the Mad Bomber Squirrel started to cuss and throw
pine cones at our busses from the top of the trees. The Freemans got the
worst of it, as the things kept hitting on thier pop-top, but we got a few
clanks as well. The Mad Bomber kept it up for as long as we were there...
      The guide books list the Top of the World Highway (the Alaska part) as
poor road conditions, so after the ravages of the Dempster, Bob Hoover, Sue,
Pete &amp; Sally and myself decided to skip that leg, take it easy for a day at
Klondike, then get down to Whitehorse a day early. This also worked well for
Gary &amp; Corenne, as they had always intended to split from the group at this
point and head down to Grande Prarrie to visit with friends. So, all of us
are now enroute to Whitehorse. We stopped about an hour ago at the Partridge
Creek Farm again, and are going to have a big community salad and stew
tonight, with fresh veggies, and corn and beets cooked over the campfire...
Makes me hungry just to write about it. They also bought 2 Strawberry/Rhubarb
pies for dessert... Eat your hearts out folks...  ;-)
     These couple of days have really been great, as we have developed a
tighter sense of community. Stopping for a few days and having a smaller
group really makes it easier-with a big group it gets difficult to share the
same little fire, and everyone is always doing something different. But the
last two days we've had virtually everyone in the same spot, and it's been
very enjoyable. I think in the future when we do these things we should plan
for more lazy days, as they really get nice after a few weeks of driving...
     Things are starting to break apart now. We made our concentrated effort
for Inuvik, and now people are beginning to scatter. Our first loss was Dave,
who headed back to Alaska a day early from Inuvik. I will also soon be
parting from the group, as I must pick up Samantha at SEA-TAC on the 12th, so
the next few nights will be the last I spend with the group, and in less than
a week I will be reunited with Sam. It's been hard to be without her, but I
think she was happier this way. She doesn't care much for the hardships of an
early westy, having spent over a year touring Dead shows in a '74. Next time
we do this kind of thing I'd like to do it in a Synchro Vanagon Westy... I
know, dream on...   ;-)
      So I'm finally on the journey home. Many miles lie ahead, but each one
brings me closer to home. I'm ready.
Peace,
Eddie
