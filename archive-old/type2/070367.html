Okay. Maybe I should try a free-market approach.

Five dollars to the listy who can tell me where this plague is coming from.
As bad as it is in public, the server is catching 9 out of 10 of these and
bouncing them out again. Would one of you AOLers who has some sense go and
see whether we're being talked about in the VW folder, or whatever they
have there? Maybe I can get them to upload a proper instructions file.
