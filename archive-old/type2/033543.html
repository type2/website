Subject: Re: Seat upgrade

Ray, wish I could help you out with that question, but my experience is 
limited to ' 75 and up busses and vanagons. It would think that the seat 
tracks would be the same, but if not, it looks to me that you could modify 
the seat rails on the late vanagon seats to fit your ' 68 tracks, or alter 
the vanagon seats to accept the ' 68 rails and then slide ' em right in.
Sorry for the lack of useful info, Beckett
