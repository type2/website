Subject: Re: Water tanks 

This is good advice to save your water tank. Another step will save your 
water pump. Pour a little bit of non-toxic RV-water-system antifreeze in 
the bottom of the tank.

I found a few years ago my previously functioning water pump would not 
work in the spring. I drained the water tank in the fall but some water 
was left in the pump. It froze, bending and jamming the impeller blades 
in the pump.

I now pour about 250 ml (one cup) of non-toxic antifreeze in the tank. 
This saves the pump but leaves a bad taste in the tank from the 
antifreeze. This requires repeated flushing of the tank in the spring. 

Anybody have other suggestions for an anti-freeze that will not taint the 
tank?

&gt;We're finally getting some really cold weather, with lows tonight in some 
&gt;areas predicted to be below zero.  
&gt;
&gt;After you've checked the antifreeze in your Air-Cooled VW engine, don't 
&gt;forget to drain your camper's water tank.
&gt;
&gt;A frozen and split water tank, when it thaws out and melts all over the 
&gt;inside of your bus, is no fun at all.  Repairing them is difficult if not 
&gt;impossible, and replacements aren't available at your FLAPS.
