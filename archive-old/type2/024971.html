Hey,

My '68 project needs to go!

I had a few bites at 1000 and an
offer for the parts only for 500.

BUT I want it to stay together, or
at least all go to a good home.

So here is the deal:
1968 Deluxe Walkthrough for $350.

That includes $600+ worth of
NEW, in the box, Bus Depot
parts.  Spare trans and front
beam.  Spare window glass.  Good
front windshield.  Front emblem.
AC.  Lenses, lights, turn signals
are all there.  The inside spare
tire cover is even still with it.

No engine.

Will need bumper work.  Body freshly
painted and the paint has never seen
daylight.  NO rust!

The hitch?  You gotta come and get
the WHOLE thing.

There is a tow bar on the front set
up for a 1 7/8 ball and it tows great
at 60mph.

Come on guys, I have other projects
to start and it has got to go.

Joe
