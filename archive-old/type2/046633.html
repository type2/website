Subject: [T2] rear defogger repair question

While we are on the subject, I would like to know if one wanted to paint-in 
several lines (or all, for I fear the continuity is corroded out in many 
places) on the glass while it was in a horizontal configuration for ease of 
paint application, would one remove the glass from the hatch, the hatch from 
the hinges, or the hinges from the body with the least amount of effort and 
trouble reassembling it? I've also contemplated turning the van upside down, 
then opening the hatch, but that has its shortcomings....
