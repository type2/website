Subject: Re: How fast do you actually drive

Hello Listees,

I normally cruise my '69 Kombi 60-65 mph (actual corrected speed).  It
will easily cruise 70 which I sometimes do on shorter runs when the wind
isn't blowing too hard.  I am uncomfortable at higher speeds when it's
windy.  I have had the bus up to 80 and still accelerating.  It's just
too hard on my nerves and I worry about my engine at anything over 70.
It's more serene at 60-65.  BTW, my engine is stock displacement but
balanced with dual Kadrons, 009, extractor exhaust, 110 cam and
Pertronix.  Also have full flow oil filter.
