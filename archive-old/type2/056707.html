Middle of summer &amp; I'm worried about cold piddies(this little piddie
went to market...). I am considering getting a P4 propane furnace for
Geraldene('69 westy).  She didn't come with a propane tank so what I
need to know is the campmobile propane tanks the same though all years?
Does anyone have a better plan for a holding tank?  

thanks

Brad
