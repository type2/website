Gonna use this on a bus????  yer gonna need to check clearance on the 
top 
and probably get a low profile air cleaner assly.

Denny, got the Fischer, &quot;how to Hot Rod...&quot; book?  Read more about the 
proper manifold there....and how to set up dual port intake manifolds 
properly in order to make it run well!&quot;

Thanks Dave,
The links were educational.
Dual port.
Unsure re plenum.
Already using on a bus w lo pro cleaner. My heat riser tube is non repairable. I may just replace my heat riser tube if nothing ez shows up.

I'll keep my eye open for the Fisher, sounds relevant.
I'm not really trying to Hot Rod anything, came w bug spray and 009 25 years ago, works OK for me. I'm considering going back to stock, but now is not the time, I'm putting in a new Mexican longblock and don't want to make too many changes at one time, trouble shooting nightmare.

this.

wrong one looks like this

Right one looks like this
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=191732

I can't believe this guy is asking $200 for a holley 2110 and so 
everyone knows what these look like...
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=193915

This one is *not* a bug spray
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=183706

Hmmm...interesting...not one single dual port holley intake manifold on 
thesamba_dot_com
