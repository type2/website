Whilst I have never seen this in anyVW documentation, six years is sound
advice.  Steel reinforcement in the tyres will corrode over a period of time
due to ingress of moisture and delaminate inside the tyre carcass.  This
obviously leads to a weakness and potential catastrophic failure.  I have
investigated many tyre failures as part of my job and a cause on several
occasions has been internal failure of the tyre casing due to corroded steel
wires.  Trailer tyres are the worst, as people just forget about them.  If
the tread depth is OK it does *not* mean the tyre is safe.
One little tip that may be helpful is how to interpret the 'DOT' code
stamped on the vast majority of tyres.  We have our American cousins to
thank for this legislation and the code gives the week the tyre was
manufactured and the year.  Look for the letters DOT and in the same
sequence there will be a pressed oval containing a three number code.  There
may be some letters after the 'DOT' but you are looking for the numbers in
the oval.
For example if the oval mark after the letters DOT contains 378, this is a
tyre manufactured in the 37th week of 1998.  Only assumption is that you
will know the decade and it's not an '88 tyre!  Oh yes, it does happen.
Regards all, Bobby

Subject: old tires


&gt; Some time back there was a post asking about the advisability of running
on old
&gt; tires. My wife just bought a 1993 Eurovan and while reading through the
owner's
&gt; manual came across this warning from VW, &quot;Tires age even if they are not
being
&gt; used. Tires which are older than 6 years old should only be used in an
emergency
&gt; and then with caution.&quot;
