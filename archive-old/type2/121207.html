Subject: copper nuts for exhaust

Hi,  Awhile back I thought i had heard someone mention a source for the 
correct metric
copper nuts for the exhaust (M8X1.25) I having no luck finding a source. 
I think it was an online
bolt/nut store but none of these stores seem to sell copper nuts. I've 
looked at boltdepot_dot_com and
sent them an email but Ihaven't heard back yet.  Where have you bought 
these?

Alex
