Subject: compatible engines+trannys

    Hello List!  I would like to know if a 72 1.7 fit on my 74 tranny.  The 
engine the 74 bus came with is a 1.7 with no smog pump hole in the heads.  I 
would assume this is a 72 engine.  However the case number is CB 202 919, 
which I think is a later case.  It seems this engine was created in a 
previous rebuild. I see no reason why a 72 engine would not fit since the 
existing engine already has 72 specs.  I just want to make sure.  I have been 
searching books, archives and library for info on engine and tranny 
compatibility.  I have encountered many different ideas.  In Muir, There is a 
woeful story of a 75 tranny in a 78 bus causing a trashed tranny seal.  Tom 
Wilson seems to make no mention of engine + tranny compatibility.  In the 
library article on T4 swap considerations there is also no mention of engine 
+ tranny compatibility.  They simply say that any engine can be swapped with 
only minor modifications.  Bentley indicates a tranny change in august of 73. 
 The question remains, what engines go with what trannys?  Can anyone shed 
some light on this subject?  Maybe we could put together a table of engine to 
tranny compatibility for future reference.  Thanks for taking the time and 
energy to read this, Pete
