Subject: Vacuum Leak(s)

I have just reinstalled my engine after a trans swap, but I'm having idle
problems.  After adjusting the points gap, setting dwell, and timing, I
read in the archives that my problem is most likely a vacuum leak.  What is
the best way to detect where the leak is.  One source may be the cracked
vac. hoses inside the engine bay.  Is there a good source for replacement
vac. hose in all of the various sizes used by VW?

Thanks in advance.
