Subject: Rescue: Alabama Getaway

  Greetings fellow Air-Cooled rescuers! I'm briefing you all on this coming
weekend's daring rescue, which will lead me hundreds of miles across the
country to the deep, mysterious land of Alabama.
  As you may recall, last summer, several friends and I drove our busses across
this scenic countryside of ours, and in the process saw a lot of old VW's, in
various states of repair. Early in the trip, Uncle Joel was kind enough to put
us up for a couple nights while we used his nice, flat, paved driveway for
repair purposes.
  Besides his spiffy techno-Vanagon, Joel has a lovely '68 Crew Cab there as
well, which caught my eye. I've been wanting a Crew Cab for quite some time. I
had a '65 single cab for a while, but it was really lacking in interior space.
So, I needed a double. Actually, I had corresponded with Joel about his a
couple years ago, when I first joined the list, but it just didn't seem
feasible.
  Now, either because I've learned a lot more about busses, or else I've just
forgotten a lot about the laws of reality, we've worked out a plan for me to
get it.
  Basically, Tuscaloosa is a bit over 600 miles from Raleigh, which amounts to
a good day's driving. I've enlisted a fellow rescuer, and my trusty mechanical
tutor, Sean, and his '71 crew cab to go with me, and carry down my engine, and
tools and such.
 Unfortunately, when your plans depend on someone else, you're at their mercy.
Since Sean runs a shop for his business, he has customers to satisfy. While I'm
helping him out in the evenings, it's still up in the air as to when we leave.
Hopefully Thursday afternoon, but Friday at the worst.
  Special Agent Easterwood, along the way, has offered us the use of his
driveway, and a tour of his plentious bus collection along the way.
  Anyway, the plan is to get to Alabama, swap the engines, do the necessary
brake work, put in a battery, and high tail it back home, in time for work
Monday morning. Also, if there's time, there's a nice junkyard there that has a
pop-top that I want for my '67.
  So, I thought I'd brief you all before hand, so that if this turns into
another Grendel, you'll be ready for all the posts and such. Hopefully, though
, things will go pretty smoothly.
  On another happy note for the Air cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team, our shirts are
coming in from the printers. I've gotten some, and expect the rest in the next
day or so. They should all go out early next week. (I've put my special
administrative assistant on the case)
:)
So, stay tuned, and keep those fingers crossed for our first big rescue!
