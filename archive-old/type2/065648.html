&gt;Yo,
&gt;        I've got replace the rear wheel bearings on a guy's '70 Bus.  In the
&gt;catalogs, all I can find is an inner bearing.  Do they have outer bearings?
&gt;Does anyone know?  Does anyone care?  I would like to find out soon
&gt;because I have to pick up the bearings from JCW, but I'm not quite sure on
&gt;what to get.  Is it set up like a bug, or is it different?  Any info. would
&gt;be much appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;&quot;An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Quickie question
