&gt; Now your talking Karl--
&gt;
&gt; Pumkin Orange  Parcel Tray Netting--

Kewl!  The netting in mine is certainly faded, but I don't believe it
was ever pumpkin orange (may be!)

&gt; &lt;&lt;Ever do crochet or tatting? That is how you repair it.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Nope, but I knit----will that work?

Crocheting is a knot-tying technique.  It's doable with monofilament,
but that stuff has a lousy &quot;hand.&quot;

&gt; &lt;&lt; Not the Bus Depot plastic one, the Bus Boys copy:

&gt;
&gt; Right--this is why I was asking how in the heck he repaired the netting
&gt; with fishing monofiament line---
&gt; It's almost an impossibility--- ~: )

Like I said, monofilament is hard to handle.  I more or less &quot;sutured&quot;
the tears together.
