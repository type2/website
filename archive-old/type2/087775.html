Subject: Re: [T2] 74 bus fuel pump



&gt; Is there anyway to fix my existing fuel pump without having to replace it.
&gt; I have a 74 bus which seems to have a pretty pricy fuel pump.  Or can
&gt; someone tell me where to get one at a good price.

I would just fork over the cash the Bus Depot or a FLAPS wants for a new
pump. &quot;rebuilt&quot; pumps usually dont last that long and wind up with the
dreaded, &quot;VAPOR LOCK&quot;.
