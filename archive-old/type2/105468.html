&gt;I set my timing at 4 degrees BTDC at idle and 28 degrees BTDC at high rpms.

&gt;I have received a couple of emails suggesting a greater advance of 38 
&gt;degrees or 40 degrees BTDC.
&gt;
&gt;My Question:  suggestions/recommendations of best timing settings from 
&gt;those who are
&gt;experienced or have a set up similar to mine.

Well, I've got an 1898cc type1 engine with 6.9:1 CR, semi-hemi cut heads, 
dual Kadrons, a 009,
and a CDI.  I time it to 16 deg BTDC static, which works out to something 
like 36-38 deg?? at full advance.

In his Kadron instructions, Gene Berg said,

         Set the timing statically at 7 to 10 degrees, or with a strobe 
light to a total of 31 to 34 degrees
         before TDC as a starting point.  When 6.6 to 6.9 CR is used you 
may find that 2 to 4 more
         degrees will provide better power and gas mileage.

This is for use with a 009 distributor on a type1 engine.  I do not know 
the total advance of an 050,
or how/if a type4 engine would differ.
