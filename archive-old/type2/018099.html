Subject: Re: would 009 diz cause a '77 too run hotter than a stock diz?
Message-ID: &lt;37457C21.B1A8AD8A_at_harmon.bml_dot_usouthal_dot_edu&gt;

      You know, I just had a second thought on this -- are you running
FI or carbs? I've never run FI with a 009. I had a 050 (like the 009,
but better for buses) with my engine and a Weber, but when I put in FI,
I also switched to the stock dizzy, since that works much better for the
T4 engine, and especially for FI, which assumes it's there. I really
would recommend getting a stock dizzy anyway, for the T4 (although I
always used the 050 on my '69 upright engine, and preferred it
definitely) as the T4 really needs that extra 10 degrees or so of
advance that the 009/050 doesn't have. FI could maybe have a real
problem with that, and, in fact, it could be unburned fuel going into
the muffler and burning there which causes excess heat in that area.
      I'm cc this to the list, to get others input --
