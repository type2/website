Subject: engine conversation pieces

&quot;Make-up&quot; from last Fri!!
Old hydraulic lifters make good conversation pieces- I take out the
retainer circlip, remove the spring, and stick the piston in upside down
and challege people to get the piston out- negative air pressure holds it
in- trick is to get it past the side hole- you throw it down hard on a
carpet hole down, and it will force it beyond the hole and come out!
-same with CLEAN cv joints- try to reassemble them!
