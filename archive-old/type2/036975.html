Subject: Re: Power at RPM is lousy

Turns out it was the elbow that goes from the AFM to the auxiliary air
regulator. Cracked and miserable was this elbow. The hose that led to
it was really bad too. I had cleaned out the AFM and made sure that the
flap flapped and made all the connections snug. After that things ran
great for about 15 miles. Then the caughing and sputtering again so I
stopped at Kmart to buy some electrical tape to just get things under
control until I could get back home tonight. Well as soon as I touched
the hose from the AFM to the AAR the elbow cracked apart. So I muttered
some obcene words and tried to get the hose to stretch between the BIG
S and the AAR well then the hose crumbled in my hands so I cursed my
mother for bringing me into the world and vowed vengeance on my father
and proceeded to wrapp the whole thing in an elaborate network of tape
and clamps. It'll do until the vdub shops open tomorrow. Thanks all -
CLW

&gt; &gt; I have a 79 bus (CA edition) that suddenly has no power. What happens
&gt; &gt; is that when I am at low RPM every thing seems normal, when I try

&gt; &gt; accelerate fast it sputters and almost seems ready to die. It also
&gt; does
&gt; &gt; not seem consistent. Sometimes (rarely though) it seems to work regularly.
&gt; &gt; If I try to accelerate slowly I have no problem. If I put the hammer
&gt; 
&gt; check the plug on the AFM it sounds like it might be working loose.
&gt; ask me how I know?!
