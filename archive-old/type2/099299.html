Subject: GRrrrrrr... CD, AW (Engine code # confusion)

Hey, Nice day today! (-8F here, not nice at all...)
A few question if I may!
Well, i was cleaning my engine case last night at 2am!!! (don't ask) 
with a nice cold beer (well, maybe 3!) and after removing 2in thick of 
oil chunk, dirt and who knows what else is cooked on my spare case, I 
finally saw the case part # CD000920........ So I look in the Bentley 
......./$?&amp;/?(*%/ Grrrrrrrr....Automatic transmission, August 1972 
through July1973!!!! Well, that make sense, my 2 spare distributors (one 
is brand new) were automatic transmission distributor!!!
My bus is a 73 Westy with a CAN reman engine # 021 100 031BX, you can 
read: Exchange, May be used for engine code CD. Head # (forgot those!) 
are 1700cc. The tranny is a manual (STD 4 speed, of course!)

I am in the process (long one) of rebuilding my spare CD core!
 
Question:
-Any thought about the 021 100 031BX code made for Automatic tranny?
-CAN I USE MY AUTOMATIC CORE? On my manual tranny?
-What is the physical difference between a CD core an a CB core. (pilot 
bearing on crank)

Also, if I can take a few other minutes of your time:
I have my eyes on a used 2.0L complete engine, including complete 
exhaust!, intake.
Will my engine cooling thin, transmission, fan housing and other stuff 
will fit the 20.L block?
In other words, it is an easy swap if I keep all my existing engine 
thins, tranny.......
Many thanks, Ben
