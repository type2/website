Subject: pushrod seal replacement-LAST WORD

I've seen all sorts of suggestions on pushrod seal replacement (referring
to later FI engines with SPRING CLIPS between rockers and end of pushrod
tube.  ^The suggestiuon of expandable split dowel was good, but could dent
OUTWARDS the tube if too much expansion occurs?--- The summary on this:
1. LEAVE ENGINE IN- if out, KEEP IT LEVEL &amp; HIGH so you can get at tin
underneath ..easier if doing this when oil dropped for change....
2. Remove tin underneath to expose tubes; remove valve covers. Try slipping
a channel-lock plier over clip, use leverage against cover and pull down!
3. NOTE how spring clips hold tubes under rockers- practice putting them in
just as you saw them- flat edge of clips hold tube at BOTTOM &amp; shouldn't
seem to be inside tube!!
4. Remove rockers, pushrod tubes (keep in order!!)-keep engine level!  A
good time to check that accessible head nuts are torqued up.
5. From underneath, spray everything around tube with gumout; blow out the
crevices in head, case with compressed air.
6. Try rotating tubes with fingers- DON&quot;T USE VICE GRIPS!- if they turn,
you should be able to pull them thru head with the friction of your fingers
on CLEAN tube!
7. If they don't turn (stuck, especially if someone used sealer), try first
wrapping duct tape around clean tube so tape has a tail you can PULL on
towards head.  THEN you can try the expandable dowel trick- if still stuck,
put tubes on your list of parts to get and use the vicegrips!   I'd try
first spraing in a solvent like acetone to dissolve sealer.
8. Clean all head, case holes with gumout- I put gumout on rags, q-tips for
the part around the lifters; the head side you can spray right in there.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is best time to replace a hydraulic lifter- pull it out by magnet
or jamming a cut nail into end (or use mounting end of chainsaw file,
binding sideways, and pull.)
9. With nice ROUND used or new tubes, slide on the o-rings.
10. Gently slip the smaller end thru head hold, guide tube down to case-
some people put a small layer of silicone around placed ring just to
lubricate it, not so much to seal it.
11. Slip tube into both case and head hole until it is all the way in.
Rotating in a screwing motion may help, or tap on a small piece of dowel or
pipe with same OD as tube.
12. Return pushrods (can oil flow thru them?) and rockers; guide rods into
rocker holes as you crank down rocker nuts! Return clips, remembering where
they sit!
13. Adjust valves (I would) so rocker screw is just touching valve stem,
then Bentley says in three more turns; I use 1/2 full turns; this is
supposed to center adjustment in middle of lifter piston play. FUN!!
14. Run the car before replacing covering tin so you can check where any
leak is starting.
