Subject: update on my bus coming home

Hello type2 list family so wednesday i brought ny bus
home from from greenwich. As i was driving her home i
realizied how much i missed driving her. The engine
was so quite i guess i never realizied how bad my old
exhaust and old engine was till i was driving my new
setup. I can actually now i can  have a decent
conversation without yellowing or blasting my radio to
hear the music. Yesterday i decided to take her out of
the garage despite all the skush and stuff on the road
it was awesome driving her around town doing errands.
the holding temperature with the cold weather 120f
from the vdo temperature guage a new addition to my
bus which i am so happy now i have. After 50 more
miles my engine hits 300 miles then i do another oil
change just wanted to write in to report my bus coming
home. I would like to personnal thank everyone on this
list also Bob Donalds for the beautiful engine Freccia
brothers for installing the engine and all the
beautiful work my family for the support and time and
letting me borrow money to finish my bus thanks again
everyone have a safe holiday and drive safe 

ps I am thinking  of putting a wreath on the front of
my bus has anyone done this and how do i put it on
