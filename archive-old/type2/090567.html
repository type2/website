LONG MAY YOU RUN 
     ---------------- 
     We've been through some things together 
     With trunks of memories still to come 
     We found things to do in stormy weather 
     Long may you run.  
      
     Long may you run.  
     Long may you run. 
     Although these changes have come 
     With your chrome heart shining in the sun 
     Long may you run. 
      
     Well, it was back in Blind River in 1962 
     When I last saw you alive 
     But we missed that shift on the long decline 
     Long may you run. 
      
     Long may you run.  
     Long may you run. 
     Although these changes have come 
     With your chrome heart shining in the sun 
     Long may you run. 
      
     Maybe The Beach Boys have got you now 
     With those waves singing &quot;Caroline No&quot; 
     Rollin' down that empty ocean road 
     Gettin' to the surf on time. 
      
     Long may you run.  
     Long may you run. 
     Although these changes have come 
     With your chrome heart shining in the sun 
     Long may you run.

May all your roads be long, winding and relaxed.
