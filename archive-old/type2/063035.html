Subject: rarity of loafs, splitties, etc.

We have quite a few loafs running around here in E. TN, but not many junkers.  They seem to either live forever or disappear shortly after death.  I have been having the hardest time finding suitable parts for the '69.  The population of bricks and spaceshuttles has risen proportionally with the decline of the splittie and loaf population.  I personally know of only 3 splitties driven even sparsely in this area.  Our loaf population is showing signs of a rebound, however.  Though I am in the minority with the pre-72 vintage, I am happy to pass a '74 Kermit Green Westy on a daily basis.  

I wish we had a VW graveyard somewhere around here instead of the guy in Friendsville at Bill's Bug Parts that charges arms and legs for JUNK.   He wants $60 for a bug windshield with CHIPS IN IT.  He think's it's special because of some stupid tint that some teenager put on the top of it.  I didn't have the heart to laugh in his face.

We need VW parts in E. TN!!!!!!  Please, a source to emerge from the woods!
