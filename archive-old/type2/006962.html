I'm trying to pull the engine on my '78 2.0 FI and the engine just won't 
separate from the tranny.  The right-front engine bolt has to be the 
culprit.  I removed a 15mm bolt from just above the starter mounts - I 
thought from the Bentley pictures that this is the one, but Muir says 
that if it's not 17mm, it's the wrong one.  I've seen some messages in 
the archives that imply that I actually want to remove the upper mounting 
bolt for the starter, but this bolt isn't hex, it's round with one flat 
side.  I pulled the engine three years ago without any complications, I 
just don't remember what I did differently :(.  Anyone have an idea what 
my problem is - I'm about ready to put the bolts back in and drop the 
tranny with it so I can see what I'm doing, but I'm somewhat limited by 
help and jack resources.

Thanks,

Chris Grim
