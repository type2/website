Subject: Re: [T2] Replaced the clutch cable- WHY is it too long??

&gt;The bad news- I replaced the cable with a new one I've had in the Westy
&gt;a few years -got the cable hooked up in front, got it thru the Bowden

&gt;seems an inch too long (IE, when you pull the arm so the throwout
&gt;bearing just contacts the pressure plate, most all of the threads were
&gt;showing

All I can say is that every clutch cable I've used on my '73 (well, that's 
only two) was the same way.  I double-checked the part number too.  I guess 
it's no big deal since using every last thread seems to allow the proper 
adjustment, but it is tiring turning that wing nut off and on that far.
