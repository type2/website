I *love* this! Questions I know the answers to!

&gt;The &quot;air non return
&gt;flaps&quot; (the small metal flaps that used to go in-between the lower fan
&gt;ducts and the heat exchangers--according to Bentley diagram) are
&gt;missing.

Most of them are. There was a discussion a few days back about these things
(buried in the debate on negative vs. positive pressure in the engine
compartment). Photo at http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/exhaust2/P6300006.JPG

&gt;Also one of the heat exchanger clamps (above where a flap was)
&gt;is missing and is replaced with a muffler bandage.

Those are mostly missing, too. And I found out they hold those little flaps
on. Definite connection there, eh?

&gt;And 2). A &quot;heat
&gt;shied&quot; is missing on one of my exhaust pipes--at least I think that that
&gt;is what is missing.

I think you're talking about the covering for the heat exchanger. There's a
name for it, but I forget what it is just now. It's a pretty thin bit of
metal and rusts out pretty quickly.

&gt;My question is: Do I need these flaps (1) and &quot;heat shield&quot; (2)?

I have no idea how long mine were missing. I bought my bus and went from
California to Texas and back before I even knew to miss them, so IMO you
don't need them. I think you're ok on the heat exchanger, too -- that
covering was too thin to be much more than protection from the elements.
Others will elaborate, I'm sure.

&gt;Thanks in advance.  The archives have been an immense help to me so far.

I wish I could be more help, but 75-78 heater boxes are scarcer than the
proverbial hen's teeth at the junkyards here in SoCal.
