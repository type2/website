&gt; You are correct- 79 and later CA originals were all electronic ignition.
&gt; Sorta the same subject as Karl was getting at yesterday: Books are often
wrong!

&gt; You don't have to take out the distributor to determine whether it has
points.
&gt; If it has points, there is a single wire (usually green) coming from the
&gt; distributor and going to the coil. It's also prettty easy to pop off the
cap
&gt; and rotor and see what's there. Not much chance of making it worse!

I've taken the cap off (not that scared) and saw a solid metal plate, where
on friend's older vw's I've seen the points right away, that's what made me
wonder about electronic ignition. What is that solid plate?

Also, can anyone refer to a site with a good practical tune up procedure for
the later type 4, possibly even dealing with california models specifically
( the distributor is unique yes?. Muir doesn't quite get it here. Or maybe I
don't!

Thanks for your comments Al.
