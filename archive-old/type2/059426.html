Hi Volks,

I've got a &quot;new&quot; bus!  '71 camperized panel, quite ugly above 
(rusted through rain gutters, windshield seam, and one wheelarc, plus 
a bondoed nose) but NO RUST on frame at all, seems to have been dark 
blue originally but is now brownish-red with a white roof.  Without 
engine, front spare tire mount and camper interior (PO wants them 
back, fine with me), it cost DM 300 (ca. US$180).

Gonna weld shut the holes (including the hacked window hole on the 
left side), paint her in original colour (but leave the roof white), 
and put Uncle Gerbelmann to his deserved rest in the VW Bus Museum in 
Salzgitter.  No name surfaced yet, currently she's called &quot;Erik's 
POS&quot; and deservedly so... but she'll become a nicer one as time goes 
by.  And a '71 pick-up will join her come Spring.  (Everyone told me: 
don't get a 2nd bus, one is fine but pairs tend to multiply.  They 
sure do :-)

Gave me some MX code ideas too.  I'm collecting all the posted ones 
BTW, and will put 'em on the Web by Friday.  :-)  Any additions, 
p-mail please.

Yours,
    Erik.
