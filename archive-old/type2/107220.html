&gt; Now onto my next question. I have a distributor with a vacuum
&gt; advance and I think the vacuum is going. I talked to a couple of &quot;old
&gt; timers&quot; who told me to try to find another distributor with vacuum
&gt; advance and to stay away from the Bosch 009 version as I have dual
&gt; carbs. Is there a place where I can order one as my local parts store
&gt; doesn't carry anything (VW Related) besides the Bosch version (which
&gt; they have to order)?

aircooled_dot_net for their SVDA distributor.

&gt; My last question is hopefully a simple one too. I have looked at
&gt; Bus Boys, Bus Depot, and a few others VW related sights and I can't seem
&gt; to find a alternator with a higher output, seems like everyone just has
&gt; a stock replacement.

Usually expensive items for type I engines.
