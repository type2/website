Subject: RE: [T2] gas heater questions

I have two questions about heat. First, where can you get a B1C and how much 
do they cost? Second, Would my 74 bus have the control switch for the heat 
vent in the middle of the floor? It has always been on and I hven't seen a 
switch under my seat that would control it, it would be nice to end that 
extra heat up front.
