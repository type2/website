Subject: Junk Yards in Orange County, CA? (Was: Some more pics of my 73
  and Q about points grease.)

I'm not familiar with a good bus yard in OC. I go to Pick Your Part and
Ecology regularly. They rarely, if ever, have ACVW's. :(  But I go for parts
for the Volvo and the Fiero too.

Anybody want to steer me to a good one?

Also, any stores in OC that stock things like the engine tin seals? Today is
work on the bus day for me...

Thanks,
Don
