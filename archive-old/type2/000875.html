&gt; Hi,

&gt; Jim Hood writes:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; We're all familiar with the spare tire mounted on the front of a bus,
&gt; &gt; but has anyone mounted a spare on the back hatch
&gt;
&gt;  It's not unusual to see rear mounted spares here in the UK. I think
&gt; there were a couple of the local conversion companies that used to
&gt; do this as part of their standard camper setup to make more space
&gt; inside.
&gt;
&gt;  The weight of the wheel doesn't go onto the hatch, though, there's
&gt; a frame that attaches to the bumper (maybe with a hinge type
&gt; arrangement to swing it out of the way to access the hatch and
&gt; engine bay).
&gt;  I think I've seen a couple of different arrangements- some more
&gt; complex than others but I don't know if they were produced at
&gt; different times, with the design evolving, concurrently with
&gt; different prices/features or both.
&gt;
&gt;  I've had a hunt around for a picture of one, but not been able
&gt; to dig one up, sorry.
&gt;
&gt;  It's occurred to me in the past that you could get a complete
&gt; set of spare wheels by using the interior slot, a nose mount
&gt; a rear mount and the roofrack... Ideal for those
&gt; transcontinental trips. :-)
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;   W.
