Hi volks,

Thanks to the wisdom of several listees, our '78 Riviera is up and running again.

Bob (Big Orange Bus) now needs a new battery tray and the right, rear corner repaired (usual rust).

What can I expect to pay?  Does anyone have any references in the Portland area?  Also what can I expect to pay to have our bus painted its original color?

Thanks much!

Pete &amp; Tracy
