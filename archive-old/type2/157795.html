&gt; They do display mph, but be advised it may not be as accurate as your
&gt; speedometer.  GPS's work by taking the average of distance travelled per time, the
&gt; accurarcy of the your current speed is proportional to the the number of
&gt; satellites it is receiving at any given time. This accuracy can vary greatly in a
&gt; matter of seconds to minutes.

Back in the days of &quot;Selective Availability&quot; this was true, but these days
the speed readings are quite accurate, at least to two significant digits.
