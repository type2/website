re Michelins, all 4 of the Michelin Pilots on my daily driver are Made in
USA. They do have several different production locations and rubber plants
in the US, all their locations are listed on the Michelin website...

Hell I was well into my 30's before I even realized &quot;Michelin&quot; was a French
company! The name kind of made more sense to me after that. :-)

It never even occured to me the French could be so good at automotive parts
like tires. LOL
