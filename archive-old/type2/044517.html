Subject: Re: [T2] Inattention

dude I bought our 68 7 passenger for my wife as a mother's day present.  On
mom's day on the way to give it to her I smacked in to the back of another
car.  Less that 100 bucks to the ford tempo over 2000 to my resto project.
I bought a different shell instead. And Tuesday she will be ON THE ROAD  70
campmobile.


In fact in FLA Tampa bay I have a complete drivable 68 bus.  Driven daily
with the pass front bashed in.  Motor newer and strong as is tranny and the
rest.  Looking for $500.  OBO.  INT and engine in great shape.

&gt; 99% of all traffic accidents are caused by inattentention.
&gt;
&gt; So I just experienced a brief inattention and ran my bus into a bank on
&gt; the short drive to the store. Damn.
&gt;
&gt; It is a '76 Riviera. The front bumper is a little bent, the passenger
&gt; door is scraped and dented in, the rear tire is flat. She doesn't want
&gt; to idle well.
&gt;
&gt; The shift linkage is screwed, one notch off (automatic) tries to reverse
&gt; in park, neutral in R.. etc. Does this mean I tweaked the frame? I am so
&gt; bummed right now I can't describe it, it just happened.
&gt;
&gt; God. My baby, how could I do this. I am so pissed at myself.
