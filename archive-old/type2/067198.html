Hi All!
greetings from a very windswept aircooled Scotland!
I've only just joined the list and look forward to getting (and giving) a lot
of relevant info.
I have owned a 74 Beetle for 3 years now and have just bought my first van -
a 65 Devon which I bought for #500 (about $800) a month ago. I have given
myself up until next September to get her roadworthy and comfortable. The
main problems I must overcome in the meantime are:

1 - Stripping down the hidous quarter-inch thick layer of sand primer and
original blue paint down to bare metal and,
2 - Rewiring the whole van as the loom has been ripped out at some stage and
now has bits missing and finally
3 - finding enough spare parts as is necessary to complete the job!

basically, the interior is original (i.e. with Easicool fridge and Dudley
cooker) and the bodywork is very solid although there are a few holes here
and there i.e the battery tray and roof front airvent grill.

So here come my first set of questions for the 'board -
1 - How much would an equivalent van cost in the U.S. ?
2 - What's the best way to get the paint off ?
3 - How much is an original Devon interior worth ?
4 - Where can I get hold of a Wiring Diagram ? (I don't getting one from the
U.S. if necessary) and 
5 - Does anyone know where I can get a kind of &quot;plan&quot; of a bus showing
lengths, widths, floorspace etc as I'm going to design a new kind of interior
for her, money permitting?

Thank you all for your time and I look forward to becoming actively involved
in all the lists' activities.
Cheerio
