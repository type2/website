Oil temp will give you relative readings depending where they are placed on the
engine.  Higher or lower than normal is only an indication, and may be behind
the curve when your heads heat up.

The cylinder head temp is the most revealing (imho the most critical) and an
accurate guage can tell you a lot about what is going on.

Oil pressure is nice to know.

If you can, try to use an idiot light, or buzzer,  with each guage to attract
your attention in case you are watching that beautiful view when something goes
south.  Or, just paying attention to heavy traffic.
