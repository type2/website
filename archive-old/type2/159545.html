Subject: Re: [T2] Horn decided to start honking at the police today. :-)

Ah yest- reminds me of the time I was visiting Tony Roman in NJ and 
managed to get a rope or bungee caught around the steering wheel gap and 
the horn started to sound continuously- had to yank the horn wire.
Turns out it had bent one of those copper/brass leaves in half- simply 
bent it back.

quoth Busahaulic:
What I am referring to is
what you see after you remove the steering wheel.
There were thin copper slivers one time - IIRC they
were peeling off the underside of the steering wheel -
but I would have to disassemble again to trigger the
memory! Coulda been a different vehicle... Anyway,
once you get the steering wheel off (Loosen the nut a
bit, then rock the wheel hard until it pops loose) it
will then become quite clear.
