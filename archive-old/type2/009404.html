&gt; &gt;  I'm trying to install a stereo into my roommate's '71 bus.  I have
&gt; &gt;pounded, ground, and otherwise jammed the stereo into the dash, but
I am
&gt; &gt;having problems with the wiring.  Could someone tell me what I should
&gt; &gt;connect the &quot;Constant power&quot; and &quot;Ignition/power&quot; wires to?

Put female spade connectors on the wires and cut the length so that
they can go comfortably to the fuse block.

On a '71, the always-on wire goes to fuse #8, while the ignition/power
wire goes to #10, 11, or 12, which are all switched by the ignition.

You can connect the spade connectors to any empty male terminal on the
top of the fuse block that is in line with the desired fuse  It's a
bit of a stretch to reach some of these!

The ground wire can go to any convenient chassis ground.  I used the
mounting screw for the fuse block.

Of course, if your stereo is bigger than 25 watts or so, you will want
to run a dedicated wire from the battery.
