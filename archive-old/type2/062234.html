Mark,

Such surface cracking is normal in a high-time flywheel and is not cause for
worry.  The cracks are extremely shallow, extending only a few thousandths of
an inch.  When you have the flywheel resurfaced the layer of metal containing
the cracks will be removed.

However, there are cracks... and there are cracks.  Inspect the spigot hole
and dowel-pin holes very carefully.  ANY cracks in these areas are grounds
for scraping the flywheel.  Since your question says you are not familiar
with surface cracks on flywheels (often called 'checks' rather than cracks)
it would be wise to have the flywheel examined by an experienced automotive
machinest before it is resurfaced.
