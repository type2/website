Subject: Re: [T2] Are Bus Boys open this week?

&gt; I've been trying to get hold of Bus Boys this morning with no luck,  do's
&gt; any one know if there closed for the rest of the year?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks Doug...


We were scheduled to be open that week.  Snow and a power outage prevented
us from opening.

Thank You
