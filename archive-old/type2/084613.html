&gt;My friend and I had three sets of wheels powdercoated white for $40. We 
&gt;also had a huge pile of black parts - gas tank for my Beetle, propane tank 
&gt;for my Westy, the stone guard, etc done for another $40.

I never want to do it cheap. I want to do it smart. That means do it right 
at the lowest cost in time/money. This is an excellent example of something 
that fits the equation. Even better, powder coat is a very much more 
durable paint than anything this side of NASA. It takes a chisel and hammer 
and WORK to remove. It just laughs at gravel and sagebrush and such. At 
less than $4.00 per wheel, you couldn't do that with good enamel or 
anything like epoxy paint, both inferior. Current limitation with powder 
coat is they don't have near as many colors and tints, but new colors are 
being introduced all the time. You can't mix custom colors at the shop site.

You also have to be aware of tolerances. Mating surfaces that slip fit, 
like exhaust pipes, should be covered and not coated. If you do you will 
find out what I mean about the durability, because the paint thickness is 
considerable, and you will have to remove it to fit the parts together. 
Heavy abrasive cloth just rides on the surface. Hardened chisel and hammer 
is the only thing I found that would chip it off in little pieces.

&gt;A bit of hunting, sweat, and planning ........ can save you money.


It's the truth. Nothing like aforethought and nose to the grindstone to get 
good value from your efforts.
