Subject: cal/fed busses (was clutch)

 
--California busses varied in their exhaust systems from other busses, but I don't believe california/federal had any bearing on whether they were carbed or f.i. The cc's and fuel delivery systems were the same for any given bus of any given year (73, 1700, dual carbs/76, 2l, f.i.) etc.
