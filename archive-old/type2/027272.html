Hello listmembers,

I am ready to start soundproofing parts of my bus, however I remembered one 
little thing I might need to do first and that's clean up some of the rust, 
before I go and lay down rubber mats over the top of it. I'm guessing the 
rust will just keep getting worse under there, except I won't be paying 
attention to it till it gets really bad then.

So I am a total novice when it comes to : _____, so I started sanding down 
the rust a little. My question is, have I gone far enough, and what is the 
correct next step?

Once I have sanded it down far enough, its still bumpy, but not from the 
rust bubbled up paint, but where the little groove is where the rust ate 
away. Do I need to fill this in, before I primer it, or paint it? Or can I 
just primer what's there and slap my dynamat down over it?

Here is a picture (all pics are very small for very fast loading) of the 
passenger floor area where I sanded down the little spots already.

Here is an up close image of one of these areas, is this sanded down for 
enough?

Here is the drivers area.

And this is an up close of some of the worst rust on the drivers side.

And as long as im photo happy, here is what it looks like when some a-hole 
drives right over a pieve of broken tire rubber and it hits your nose right 
where the wipers are :

So, that's it. Once I get the drivers side sanded down and cleaned up, I 
guess I will be ready to primer and dynamat, but should I be filling in the 
holes where the rust was first?

Thanks for any info you can pass along,

Christopher
