I think it's over 6', but you probably can let enough air out of the tires
to get it under the door ;) Joe

Just don't let too much out--don't damage your tires. And don't pay for the
place on my say-so!

&gt;Hi everybody
&gt;
&gt;I have found a cheap place to store my van for the winter. A warm place in
&gt;the inside.
&gt;
&gt;But the height limit is 6 feet. Do you know what is the exactly height of
&gt;my van. It's a 76 westfalia WITHOUT pop-top.
&gt;
&gt;If you don't know, I can take the measurement. But if you have the
&gt;information, it can help me.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thank
