Subject: [T2] Paint question - Thanks

&gt;The general consensus seems to be either incompatible primer/paint combo,
&gt;i.e.. mixing acrylic and enamel (even if both are same brand) ; or oil, grease,
&gt;dirt, whatever under the paint.

&gt;So I re-sanded where I needed and tried again.  Using the same primer, which
&gt;I don't think was the problem, and a Krylon (instead of the Rust-o-leum) top
&gt;coat and this seems to have worked.  It's not perfect.  It's not a factory new
&gt;job.  But I can be happy with it.

Being happy with it is the most important thing.

Having said that, you are now the future DPO
of a bus that will require sandblasting to correct
the paint, which will  be defective soon enough,
due to poor adhesion and other problems. The
sanding scratches will appear soon as the paint
cures, if not there already. It's hard to explain to
somebody why a gallan of paint can cost hundreds
(when Krylon is only a buck a can :) is it rated 50mph?
