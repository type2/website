&gt; Maybe the bus held up well.  But it sounds like it would have been pretty

I know an old time body man who's had a shop for years and years...
He remembers cars from the fifties and sixties...The cars held up
pretty well, then, but the drivers didn't...
Most of those steering wheels were straight steel from the front end
to the horn button...;-(
I think it was the Tappet Bros. who pointed out that the driver's knees
were the crumple zone in a Bus... ;-(
