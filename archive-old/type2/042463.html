Subject: Re: mileage

my bus has 98K unless it has 198k, dosent matter to me cause i replaced 
everything that might fail, berrings alternator, starter brand new heater 
system. The milage dosent really matter if the condition is good. I.E. 48k 
porely taken care of miles might be the equivalent to 480k extriemly well 
cared for miles. Just a thought, although berings do wear out
