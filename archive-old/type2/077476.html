Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

I have a 70 westy camper, and it is called a 'sunroof camper' That is because 
they used the sunroof model to make westfalias. All you need to do is to find 
a sunroof bus of the 68-71 era in a junk yard and get the sunroof mechanism 
from it.
Have fun doing it.
