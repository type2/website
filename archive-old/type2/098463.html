&gt; &lt;&lt; If anyone didn't know, they used to send out 7 catalogs per year. this is
&gt; VERY EXPENSIVE, and have obviously reduced this waste to something
&gt; reasonable. I haven't gotten one in forever, who knows if they'll climb out
&gt; of their financial hole, but at least this is a good start.

I really think that that was a cause of their problems.  I don't recall
ever buying something from RMMW directly, and only one item was
drop-shipped from there by another vendor, yet they blasted me with a
bunch of catalogs.  The only companies that can get away with this are
companies that buy items for $5 wholesale and sell for $100 retail to
willing customers, like Victoria's &quot;Soft p*rn delivered to your mailbox
twice a week&quot; Secret.

By the time you have a bus for a year, you've found the vendors and having
them fight too much over customers isn't good for their health.
