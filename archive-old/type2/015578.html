&gt;How can we tell what size engine is in a vehicle?

The engine number stamped on the case begins with a one or two letter code.
The engine codes are in the back of the engine section in the Bentley. That
will tell you what it was when installed at the factory. That's what it
will be if someone hasn't changed things when rebuilding, like putting in a
stroked crank or larger pistons.
