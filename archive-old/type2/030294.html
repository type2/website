&gt; I am swapping in a new (used) swaybar and have new clamps and bushings (and

Yer welcome!  Don't throw it away when you are done, tho... it's the
&quot;Ginsu Vicegrip&quot;, IMHO.... It is perfect for removing the bearing cap on
the front hub and a million other tasks... I bought mine for the sway bar
and now-a-days, I use it and a pair of needle nose vice-grips for
*everything*!

&gt; What I don't have are new bolts for the sway bar itself.  Anybody know
&gt; the correct size/grade?

Alas, I don't know :-(
