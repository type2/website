&gt;I have a 1956 Single cab with chassis number 163319, the engine in it
&gt;presently has the following number on it D128023X Can anyone give me any info
&gt;as to what year and vehicle this motor belongs to if not original to this
&gt;truck? Many thanks - Tim in Minneapolis.
***************************************

According to VW's engine survey, this engine started out in life as a 1967
40HP (SAE) 1200 (European Beetle).  With the &quot;X&quot; designation, looks like
VW's rebuilt it at least once in it's lifetime.  It is of course, not
original for the 56 Truck, which used 36HP 1200's through May of 1959.
