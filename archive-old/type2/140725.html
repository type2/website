Subject: Re: [T2] can't remove shocks from torsion arm

I could try having the wife glare at it.
&gt;
&gt; Any advice?

NOW THAT'S FUNNY!!!

A plumbers propane torch will produce enough heat. Some of the metal sleeves
have a seam in them so you may be able to split it with a chisel. You could
try grinding it off. If you are trying to get it off with vise grips, don't
have the vise grips too tight because you are just clamping the sleeve
tighter to the stud.
