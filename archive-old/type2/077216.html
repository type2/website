&gt; While messing around in Mexico two weeks ago, I noticed literally hundreds

&gt; I don't know if these are Mexican local buses or imports from Brazil, but
&gt; one in 4 had a radiator....gasp. Gasoline engines. With a spot in the front
&gt; with a black plastic grill for a radiator. Stock. I actually wanted one.
&gt;
my understanding is that they use the Golf engine!
