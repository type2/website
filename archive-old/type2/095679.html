Subject: On a hunt for used 74 parts. (help me get to HCBF cont.)

I'd like to take my 74 to the upcoming High Country Bus Festival, but it 
needs a couple things before I could confidently drive it to the corner 
store, much less from MD to NC.

1) The piece of tin that goes right in behind (FIF) the cooling fan.  It's 
the closest piece to you, and right in the center if you are looking in the 
engine compartment from the rear deck lid.

2) Air cleaner(s).  My dual carbs are naked.  I think they are just the 
normal little round stock solex ones.  I use an oil bath kind on my typeI 
and I like that alot since it's re-usable and cheap (like me!).  Do they 
make those for the bus?

If your in MD we can save some shipping.  UGLY but useable and cheap is just 
fine by me, I am looking for function not form here for my people mover (for 
now).  I also don't have the foam seal that goes between engine and body.  
Can I live without it?  Can I just cut up an old matress or something?
