Ok, I am having second thoughts on whether I should have dropped my
engine while at EB.  Now I am using a quart every 100 +/- miles.  Ill be
on the freeway like I was today (taking my pregnant girl to the doctor),
and when I stop and park there is a steady stream of oil coming from
what looks like the seal between the tranny and engine.  I know I can't
go on much longer like this, even if I baby it.  Being that this is my
main vehicle, I do not want to drop this engine / engine-tranny by
myself.  I am not sure that I could get it done in one weekend.  Plus
never having done this before, there is so many little things that I do
not know and would not think about.  So, I am asking the list if there
is anyone that could help me do this engine drop.  This would have to be
done on the weekend as I am hard pressed to get much more time off of
work.  The bus is drivable and I can get it pretty much anywhere within
the surrounding area of Western North Carolina.  I would have to be able
to leave Sunday evening or eeeaaarrrrlllly Monday morning.  I have all
the seals and parts needed as I planned on doing this at EB.  I have
more money than I did then and could offer to pay at least something for
services provided.  I don't care if we do at my place or a shop.  I will
provide any food/housing/internet/etc if this was done at my place.
Thank you all for your great advice and help that you have provided.
 
In dispare..
