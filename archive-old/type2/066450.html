Subject: KYB gas shocks

Hey all:
Someone posted a week or so ago that the ride in their loaf was too stiff 
with the installation of KYB Gas A justs (or however it's spelled). Anyone 
else have a similar problem? Just ordered a set for my loaf, and in 
hindsight, am worried about jarring the fillings out of my teeth.
Bob
