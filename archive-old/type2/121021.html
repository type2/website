Subject: Re: [T2] finding #1 tdc firing position

Yeah, but the crank turns twice for every 1 turn of the cam.  So aren't
there two instances where the #1 rod are at TDC... and both of those are
not the #1 firing position.

My other engine dizzy is 180 off and I want to avoid that on this engine
;)


&gt; fall out while turning the motor upside-down during assembly. Later in the
&gt; assembly process you can remove the distributor and install the o-ring.
&gt; 
&gt; This method is foolproof.
