Subject: Re: [T2] Brake conversion (emergency brake, vacuum ?s)

&gt;  My other question is about the rubber
&gt; boot on the end of the servo.  There appears to be another vacuum line
&gt; hookup there.  Is this opening just to vent the system? Or should it be
&gt; routed into the other line?

That hose is just the vent side for clean air to enter. On a passenger car,
that side is vented to the interior of the car. On a bus, the booster is all
underneath exposed to the elements. So the vent line goes way up into the
body, where hopefully water and dirt will not enter. The booster has to be
open on the back side so the diapraghm can displace the area. If it was
sealed, the diapraghm could not move.
