&gt; How late of a bay is a &quot;late bay&quot;? My 1972 has these.


There's no fine line, but the division is around '71.  Early bays had type
1 engines, drum brakes, low turn signals in front, separate back-up
lights, and rounded intake vents.  Late bays had type 4 engines (in the
US), disc brakes, front turn signals on either side of the intake grill,
integrated back-up lights, and squarish intake vents.

AS you know, all of the changes did not occur in the same year.  My '71 is
mostly early bay, but it does have disc brakes.
