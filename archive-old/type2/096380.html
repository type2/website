Subject: Re: [T2] Even More FI Rich/Lean Questions

&gt; Why does the L-Jetronic fuel pressure regulator in my bus sample the air 
&gt; input manifold pressure?

In order to keep the difference between the pressure in the engine, and 
the pressure of the fuel constant, so that the computer knows how much 
fuel it is letting in if it opens for a specific amount of time.

&gt; If the vacuum line to the regulator is removed and blocked would the engine 
&gt; run richer? Would the vacuum drop.

The vacume would be uneffected. The engine will run a little rich at idle, 
and get worse as the engine speed goes up, since fuel pressure will not 
drop as manifold pressure drops.

&gt; Is the differential pressure at the injector tip the signed sum of the
&gt; air manifold pressure and the fuel manifold pressure?

Yes.

&gt; Is the differential pressure at the injector tip held constant by the fuel 
&gt; pressure regulator control loop?

Per above, this is the idea.

&gt; If the differential pressure is held constant would fuel delivery per 
&gt; injection pulse be affected by changes in manifold pressure?

No, since the differential pressure is constant, the amount of fuel 
delivered should be constant. Manifold pressure goes up, fiel pressure 
goes up.

&gt; Is the function of the fuel pressure control loop to control the 
&gt; differential pressure at the injector tip?

Yep. You get it. Get the Probst book. It will explain everything you ever 
wanted to know about L Jetronic, and everything that came after.
