Subject: Brake pressure regulator

The brake pressure regulator (see Bentley 1968 - 1979, section 8 page 13) on 
my 71 bus has failed.  I have looked through a couple of catalogues to no 
avail.  Does anyone have a functioning regulator they would like to sell or 
know where I can purchase one?  I haven't tried VW as they are usually my 
la$t resort.  The brakes work fine so long as I don't get in an emergency 
situation but rapid heavy brake application, especially on a wet road, can 
cause near heart failure as the back brakes lock up.
TIA
