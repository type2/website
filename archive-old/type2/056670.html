You don't need to remove the closet to replace the curtains.  There are several small screws that hold in the board that the curtain is mounted on. Then the board will just slide out (it's a little snug, but not that hard) All these screws are fairly easy to get to.  

On the subject of the closet; I just put three shelves in mine and nearly tripled my usable storage area in the closet.
