Subject: Re: [T2] brake bleeder



&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt;    I took the bleeders all the way out amd still nothing. The wheels  spin free with no pressure in the brake pedal.The brakes hold with 
pressure on them. I believe it;s in thee caliper that's it;s blocked. Can I clear out that channel 
&gt; Patrick

Sounds like the entire system needs a serious cleaning, if the bleeding passages are so clogged that they will hold system pressure!

Just as a test you might try probing the passage with a paper clip or similar wire.  See if you can poke it through.  Even if you can I would 
recommend disassembly and cleaning of the entire system.

George.
