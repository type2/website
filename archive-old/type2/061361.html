Subject: Manifold leaks

Hey everyone,
 
 I've got two leaky manifold seals (I believe they're called). They were
found by spraying acetylene near them, which caused the engine to rev.

 What's the best way to seal these leaks other than pulling the engine to
replace the seals. I was told that some sort of silicone sealant would work
well for a while. Can anyone tell me what sort of sealant to use, or
alternate methods to try?

 Thanks!

 Ian
