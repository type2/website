Richard,

The EGR filter is basically a can full of steel wool.  As Joe said, the
EGR system feeds exhaust gas, which is very oxygen-depleted, back into the
intake.  The filter is supposed to collect the nasty bits in the exhaust
and keep them from being recirculated with the gas.

It is OK to go with a used one if it is not leaking.  It is also pefectly
acceptable to use one with no rust, but I do not believe that one can be
used and have no rust... it is an oxymoron! :-)
