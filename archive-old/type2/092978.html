Subject: Re: [T2] Motor changes for the bus


&gt;I wonder how much of the 911 rear suspension could be adapted for the bus?
&gt;Except for the width, if you could basically cut the entire rear-end of
&gt;the 911 out and weld it to the back of the bus frame... Seriously, though,
&gt;if you can use the entire hub, axle, rear brakes, etc., out of the 911,
&gt;you would at least have the rear-end beefed up and maybe save on some of
&gt;the custom parts you'd have to make. The front end is another matter. You
&gt;would want to borrow as much of the front-end of the 911 as possible too.

Diminishing returns. Would the 911 transplant really be any better under a 
bus than a warmed over Bus suspension with sway bars, better bushings, and 
better brake/wheel/tire combo?

I'd guess not but I'd love to see somebody try it and give us a report.

&gt;I don't think weight is too much of an issue if you strip the bus down
&gt;some (no camper interior - or at least - no 70's westfalia). My '86 911
&gt;was just over 3400lbs - whereas my '74 Campmobile is just under 5000lbs.
&gt;I'm sure I could take 500lbs out by removing the west cabinets.

That is why I don't pursue some of the other transplants. I want 
functionality. I don't want to loose any space in my bus to radiators or 
revised engine compartments to stick in a SBC V-8. For the same reasons I 
would not want to dump the camper features of my van to loose some weight.

Seems any bus is going to drive like a bus because of it's shape. The 
suspension fixes would certainly help though.

I like dirt roads and fording creeks too much to give up the bus 
suspension. I used to often wonder about grafting a handmade 4 wheel 
independent suspension based on a hot rod style A-arm setup - upper and 
lower arms. Would work but would it be worth it? At that point - might as 
well graft in a Synchro 4WD system.

Fun to wonder about all this 911/4WD stuff.
