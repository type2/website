&gt; &gt;I noticed in an ad in Scale Auto that Revell of Germany now makes 2 1/24th
&gt; &gt;scale VW Buses.  Could someone fill me in on this?  What Years?  What
&gt; &gt;features?  Detail? etc.  One is designated UN.  Thanks in advance,
&gt; 
&gt; the UN one is molded in all white plastic. it's a personnel carrier or mobile
&gt; office ... it has the middle seat and some other stuff that you can add to
&gt; make it into the UN version, but you could easily leave the extra junk off
&gt; and make a &quot;normal&quot; Vanagon out of it.  nothing toke a Camper out of it.
&gt; 
&gt; the other one is a FuerWehrwagen ... a fire truck. :)  no, no hoses or pumps,
&gt; but a sort of &quot;command car&quot;. it has the extra stuff to make it into a Fire
&gt; Dept. vehicle, but has the normal seating so it can be modeled into a regular
&gt; Vanagon. it is molded in RED plastic.
&gt; 
&gt; both are pretty neat. about $25 each. check the full page ad for Mountain
&gt; Model Supply (or something like that) up front of the magazine; it is a
&gt; place in West Virginia. they had the best prices.

That's where I saw them, $24.99
&gt; 
&gt; i'm thinking about making one of them into a Syncro. ;)
&gt; 
Ok, so they're Vanagons.  I'll take it they're not panel vans.  Hmm, how
do they differ from the old 'Magnum PI' Vanagon (Revell US?) from the 
early 80's?  No chrome etc, but ok detail.
