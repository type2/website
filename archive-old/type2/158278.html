Subject: RE: [T2] Running rich when warm issue is back (On my knees  
  begging for help)

There is no choke. The cold start mechanism is the
thermo-time switch, air bypass valve (to increase
rpm's) and the cold start injector (for enrichening)

They are naturally aspirated - no supercharger or
turbocharger and thus rely on atmospheric pressure. So
the intake is charged only with atmospheric pressure.

&gt; Yep, it's a 7 terminal. 39, 36, 6, 9, 8, 7, 27 .
&gt; 
&gt; Resistance between 6 and 27 is 2289 ohms.
&gt; 6 &amp; 9 230 ohms
&gt; 7 &amp; 8 101 ohms
&gt; 
&gt; I forgot to put the air cleaner on the list. It is
&gt; also new. Does it have a
&gt; choke? The vane in the airflow meter works smoothly.
&gt; I had the cover off and
&gt; watched it while the engine was running. I haven't
&gt; checked the charcoal
&gt; canister yet, I'll do that tomorrow. I'll double
&gt; check the coil wiring
&gt; tomorrow. One more thing. Is there some type of
&gt; manifold pressure on these
&gt; guys? I know on newer FI cars.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for all the help so far guys. I'll get it
&gt; going yet. Lots of good
&gt; info so far.
