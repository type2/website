Subject: Re: [T2] 77 FI bus - hesitation/stuttering problem FOUND (but
  not yet fixed)

&gt;   FIRST - a great big THANK YOU to those of you who urged me to stick with
&gt; the FI and find the problem.

That's the spirit. I'm so glad you're bus was running well and I've learned
a lot from your experience.

&gt;   The bottom line is that the clamp is not holding the distributor firmly
&gt; enough, and the engine vibration over time causes the timing to change,
&gt; sometimes to the advanced side, sometimes to the retarded side!!  This is
&gt; happening despite the fact that it is being tightened down very tight, and it
&gt; is impossible to move the distributor by hand, either after I reset it, or

Can you get a new clamp? 021-905-250 is the number and Bus Boys carries
them.

&gt; when I find the timing is off.  Also, when the timing is set properly, the
&gt; vacuum advance is pressing right up against the rubber boot on the cold start
&gt; valve (a design defect, in my opinion), and so there is some pressure on the
&gt; distributor, which may &quot;help&quot; the distributor move under the ineffective clamp
&gt; and engine vibration.

That's not normal. It should be pressing up closer to the fan shroud.

&gt;   Here's a tool tip: it's not easy to get a wrench in to loosen and tighten
&gt; the distributor clamp, and using an open end wrench, you have to take it off
&gt; and put it back on several times to do the job.  Crescent Tools markets a
&gt; &quot;Ratcheting Combination Wrench Set&quot; which is a ratcheting box end wrench, and
&gt; they make the set in metric.  (Looks like the part number is FRM4.)  The
&gt; ratchet turns with just a 5 degree swing, whereas most standard wrenches
&gt; require 30 degrees.  It just slips over the clamp nut, and makes the job much
&gt; easier.  To tighten, just turn the wrench around.

That's what I use and I love those things. KD Tools also makes them under
the Gearwrench brand and I think they also rebrand them for Sears
(overpriced IMHO).

The best deals are online (also the best selection of Metric). You can get
offset, reversing, double box ends, pivoting, stubby. I prefer a studdy 10mm
for that job.
