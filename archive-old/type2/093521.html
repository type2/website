Subject: Re: [T2] VW dealers: Dont get me started  RANT

[...]

&gt;It must be a full moon....I took my '02 Jetta TDI Wagon in this morning 
&gt;for its 10k oil change ($150 btw) and while I was talking to the VW 
&gt;service guy I tried to bait him and asked, &quot;do y'all work on any aircooled 
&gt;VW's at all anymore?&quot;...to which he responded, &quot;oh sure!  We've got a guy 
&gt;back there who's a BMW specialist but also knows everything there is to 
&gt;know about air-cooled VW's and we won't turn down any work!&quot;  I was 
&gt;shocked.  I think i'll take my '74 SC in to them to get them to do 
&gt;something to it and watch them laugh me right off the lot.  g
