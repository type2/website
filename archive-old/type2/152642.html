That's probably correct (the plug was part of the diagnostic plug
system), but I wouldn't jump to this conclusion. It's always possible
that an engine could be put together with two left heads, and an extra
sensor left in place to fill the oversized tin fastening hole now on
the right side. I've seen this on boneyard engines.

That said, you're probably right Phil.
