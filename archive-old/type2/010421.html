Subject: New engine, '71 Westy, growling sound!!!!

Hi all,

Well, I just installed my new Brazilian/Mexican
engine. It ran ok the first day - I only put 4 or 5
miles on it that day. The engine itself sounds great.
On the second day I noticed a growling sound coming
from the rear of the bus. I can only hear it at low
rpms. It happens mostly when I'm using the clutch, but
I can also hear it when I'm driving along or stopped
at a light with the clutch out all the way (bus out of
gear). I'm guessing that one of the clutch parts was
installed (by me) incorrectly, perhaps the clutch
release bearing. Is it possible it could be a CV joint
or even the tranny? I'm going to pull the engine
tomorrow morning and take a look . 

What should I be looking for????

Thanks,
