Subject: Re: Invisible Texas

I'll second the vote that *all*of Texas isn't ugly (most of it, alas).  I
had a wonderful time in the woods of Northeastern Texas years ago.  It
always amuses me when people assume that I, being from California, spend
time around palm trees and beaches.  They assume that I have no experience
with snow.  I try to explain that we get some of the *most* snow in the
US (often the Sierra Nevada -- or &quot;snowy mountains&quot; get 20 to 40 FEET on
the ground!).  As well, California has its share of ugly.  Inviting
flames here, I personally think that the central valley of California
beats other places hands-down.  It's flat, hot (when not foggy), plain
butt-ugly.  Odd state, where horrid places like Red Bluff are sooo close
to richly beautiful places like Shasta...

Last year, we took an 8000 mile trek in the veedub across the US.  I came
back thinking that *every* state has some nice places and bad ones.  We
did some old route 66 in Texas, and it was even pretty there (musta been
a good day, though).  Even Kansas had real pretty parts.

This year, we did the Alaska tour.  For scenery, not much compares.  Even
Yosemite, where I live, and often voted the prettiest place, cannot
match the incredible amount of pretty places in Alaska.

One last bit of flame-bait:  if you ever drive the upper Sacramento
valley (Red Bluff, Redding, etc.) in a VW, plan to do it late at night.
This area has some of the hottest weather in the US.  A cool day there
is over 100, I think, in the summer.  Even the nights are...
