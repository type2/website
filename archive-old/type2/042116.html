Subject: unusual type2 engine number

the number on my engine case is different from any other bay type2:
w 019912 G
two other things around the number: 1) it begins with a small vw stamp,
with a clockwise arrow around it; and 2) there is  -4 above the space
between &quot;2&quot; and &quot;G&quot;

can anyone identify it?
it is living in my 75 westy, with a 77 california ECU.

thanks you
steve - in search of an orange plaid pad for over the engine compartment.
