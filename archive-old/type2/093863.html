Subject: Re: [T2] Neat light addition but disables door light:

Hi Phil,

I bought a 400 watt inverter for my westy locally for $60CDN/US$40.

If plugged into the lighter it is rated for 100W. If hard-wired it is 
good for 400W. I hard-wired it to my deep cycle spare sealed battery 
under the jumpseat and have been using the lighter connection to 
recharge from the regular battery. I have an isolator unit *and* a relay 
to hook it up but because it is a sealed unit battery I am afraid 
overcharging might damage it.

It's great for recharging my laptop and cell-phone and can power a 110V 
lamp for many hours. I haven't tried it with power tools yet. Dad has a 
600W unit that does a great job with a TV and playstation. I haven't 
tried mine with the TV yet.

12V systems are much less of a draw, and should be used instead of 110V 
whenever possible.

Happy trails,

&gt; On another note I got so tempted the other day....I found a 300 watt 
&gt; inverter with 600 watts peak for $30. Wow thats tempting. I dont know 
&gt; what I would plug in, but having the electric outlet in the westy 
&gt; hooked up for power at all times is tempting....
