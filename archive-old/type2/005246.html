Subject: Re: [T2] Oil levels???
Date: Mon, 2 Oct 2000 03:44:32 -0700
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

[...]

This anomaly has been addressed before [see the archives].

Try rotating the dipstick a few times, as far to the left and right as
possible, while holding the stick down.  Then pull the stick and check the
level.

If the result is still dubious, pull the stick and wipe it clean.  Then
replace the stick and check the oil level again.

One theory is that under some conditions/circumstances cold oil won't rise
up around the dipstick, as the space in the cavity between the stick and the
alloy case is too small.  Perhaps, but no too convincing.  Maybe some oil
gets trapped in the cooler from time to time?

I've been checking oil daily in Buses for 22 years, and I still don't know
for certain why the stick reads wrong sometimes, even when the bus has been
parked for many hours.  It never fails to rattle me, and it takes a lot of
self control not to dump in some more oil pronto.  In my early VW bus years
I made the mistake a few times of adding more oil, only to discover later
that the engine was way too full.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Hello everyone.. I have a developed the obsessive compulsive habit of
checking my oil every morning before I hit the road in my 71 Campmobile...
However...this morning I check the level and it was just over
the first mark on the oil dip stick(pretty low I guess)....so I didn't add
any oil.. drove for about 20 minutes tops...had the bus parked for 5 hours
or so...went to check the level before I left work and the oil level was
much higher..almost to the top line on the dip stick...  &lt;&lt;
