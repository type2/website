Subject: Restoring my 72 Westy
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I'm attempting to restore my 72 westy &quot;Ghetto Cruiser&quot; to as good of condition
as I can afford.  It is winter here (New York, USA) and I'm putting together a
list of engine/mechanical junk that should be done this spring, when I am
ready to put it on the road.  I think I probably should get a valve job, and
new bearings.  Anybody have some things to add?
Thanx,
Capt Tripps
