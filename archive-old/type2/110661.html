&gt; I need to know specifically what the difference is between these OEM bus heater

&gt; I'd also like to know people's experiences in hooking up the replacements
&gt; in their buses.

The OEM boxes have much larger and more efficient cast heat exchangers
inside.  The replacement is a lot lighter and doesn't pass as much heat to
the cabin.

If you have &quot;holey&quot; boxes, they can often be repaired by brazing new sheet
metal over the holes.  It's not pretty, but it is to your advantage to
keep your original boxes in service.
