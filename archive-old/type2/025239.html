Subject: BN4 experience in Seattle / Olympia area?
Date: Wed, 11 Nov 1998 15:45:40 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I know the stock heat is good, but I want better.  Forgive me if you don't
agree...  Mine is a daily driver and those first ten minutes in a area that
always rains isn't fun.  Coming out of the movie theater at 11:00pm with
your date is the worst case :)  Not just my personal comfort.

Anyway... I now have a BN4.  I am still going over it to figure out if it is
complete (I already know I don't have dash switches or any other remote
control parts).

Is there anyone who has worked one of these in the Seattle / Olympia area
(or obviously in between)?  Would you be willing to let me bring mine over
and go over it?

I'd love to have some help, even if your experience isn't real extensive.
My intention would be to snap digital photos of what we did and put them on
the WWW.

I'm not expecting a lot of response to this, but I thought I might luck out
and find someone wanting to do the same thing.

As an aside -- if you have a BN4 for sale or switch parts, I'm open to
purchasing another for parts.  $60 to $100 is the going rate that I'll
consider.  More for one that is bench tested and all complete (switches and
so forth).

Thanks.
