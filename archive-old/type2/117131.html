Subject: Re: [T2] clutch/transmission problem

When I replaced the rear shift coupling, I noticed that the hockey stick
end coming out of the nosecone had very little play -- if something were
broken inside the nosecone would there be a lot of play at this point??

I posted a little while ago about the clutch lever on the transmission
being positioned slightly toward the front of the bus without the cable
engaged...I also had difficulty installing the engine.  Is it possible that
the throw-out bearing is sitting forward perhaps 1/4&quot; too far and putting
pressure on the finger's of the pressure plate?? would this be enough
pressure to disengage the engine and clutch??

Thanks again for any help...
Chris.





I recently replaced the clutch and throw-out bearing in my '76 Westy.
After reinstalling the engine I found that the transmission would not
engage any gears (i.e., it appears to be stuck in neutral).  I replaced the
rear shift coupler, performed shift rod adjustment, and adjusted the
clutch, but the problem remains.
