Jeff,

There's a mailing list for DTM owners, although i'm not sure if its just 
for the type-1 engine DTMs or not.

you can subscribe to it by sending an email to dtm-subscribe_at_topica_dot_com

You can also go here:  http://www.shoptalkforums_dot_com/

and click on &quot;air cooled technologies&quot; or &quot;type 4rum&quot; for more info.

I've seen Jake respond in all of those forums.

For those of you who aren't aware, DTM stands for &quot;Down The Middle&quot; and is 
a new fan shrouding that Jake Raby has designed for both type-iv and 
type-i engines.  Looks pretty cool, but a little pricey for me at this 
point.

Cheers,
	Tom
