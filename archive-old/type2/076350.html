Subject: Re: [T2] After you get the CV's and axles off:

Rick Taylor writes................

&quot;CV grease is the only type of grease that will
work in this application as it does not migrate like other greases and will
not get thin under the heat and pressures that are generated.  Force the
grease all the way throught the CV by hand.&quot;

I haven't done quite as many CV joints as Rick, but I do have a nifty little 
trick for doing the actual greasing of CV joints.  Place your new (or 
absolutely clean old) CV on a piece of plastic wrap.  Just the usual kitchen 
variety plastic wrap (like Saran wrap).  You should have enough plastic wrap 
(about a foot of it) to completly bundle up the CV joint.  Then add a big 
dollop of moly (CV) grease and close up the plastic wrap around the CV joint. 
 Secure with a rubber band.  THEN work the grease through the joint.  You'll 
find that you can actually get &quot;pressure &quot; on the grease and force it into 
all the little cavities between the balls.  It makes for a much better job 
than doing it &quot;freehand&quot;.  What's more you keep your hands clean in the 
process.
