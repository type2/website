Subject: Re: [T2] air intake boot

You know which brings up an obvious question, where are the repro ones now available coming from, and of what level of quality are they?  Both the 74-75 and 76-79 now seem to be available, for about $40, has anyone used one?

&gt;have not done it myself. I once looked through several
&gt;bins of these - probably around a hundred per bin -
&gt;maybe 4 bins full - and found that about 8 out of 10
&gt;had cracks.
&gt;
&gt;If the crack is wide, you may want to use something
&gt;like fibreglass drywall tape embedded in the shoe goo
&gt;to give it some structure / support. -BaH
