&gt; &gt;And he proceeded to list the following &quot;known&quot; problems:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. Throttle linkage wears out and creates a vaccuum leak on the dual
&gt;carbs.
&gt;Replace with factory gaskets with
&gt;replacements if
&gt;available, make your own if you have to. Replace/install hose clamps on all
&gt;vacuum lines coming off the carbs. The Mechanic won't take the time to do
&gt;this, he'll just say the throttle shafts

Please, don't ask any mechanic to look at your car until you find 
references for his character. If he's a thief, it won't be that hard to 
find out. Likewise, if he is known to be honest in his dealings, that isn't 
hard to find out either. Ask at the BBB, or town hall or the court house.

Proper procedure from Bentley by memory. Rule out all possible vacuum leaks 
before doing anything about the shafts. Now you can do a very quick leak 
test for the shafts. Get it idling. Reach in and wiggle the throttle shaft. 
If idle changes, you need bushings or new carbs or unworn used carbs (fat 
chance).

If the mechanic doesn't conduct diagnosis in the proper order by procedure, 
the door to a waste of time/money gets kicked open. If you have vacuum 
leaks, you can fiddle with the carbs until your a fossil and get no 
results. So you rule that out first, by procedure. It's in the opening 
paragraphs of the fuel system section. Skip a step, waste the weekend 
fiddling.


&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. The engine is hard to access and therefore work on.
&gt;
&gt;Boo Hoo. Mechanic sounds like he doesn't like to work on his knees.

I agree. A 72 T-II is much easier to maintain than any US V8 van I have 
ever seen, and in those cases, very inventive and indignant positions are 
stock. On your knees ass in the air is one of them. He has the option to 
put it on the lift and have any working height agreeable to him.
