Subject: RE: [T2] Pushrod tube seals

Zach:

When I pulled my engine, I ended up replacing 4 pushrod tubes as well.  I
had to take the head off because #3 needed to be re-drilled.  If you're
going to replace the seals, I would replace the tubes as well.

There is a gasket/seal set up on California import's website that gives you
a seal/gasket for everything.  My bus is a 78 FI 2.0L engine.  It costed me
$65 plus shipping.  I replaced all the gaskets/seals I could.

The tubes I got from my local flaps.  I think that they were $8-9 each.

I am 1.8 years new to being a bus owner, but what I know is: Do it now
instead of doing it later saves a lot of swearing and glaring from the wife.

Subject: [T2] Pushrod tube seals

I am planning on replacing the pushrod seals, valvecover seals, and
distributor seal after I get back from a short trip next week (&lt;600 mi
round trip).  I have read through the proceedure from the library and
it mentions not to get the VW parts but rather the porsche parts since
they are of higher quality.
