Subject: Oil filer neck
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello list.   Here is an easy one.  The oil filler neck in my 71, type one
has a small chrome neck on it about 3- 4 inches long.  Apparantly for looks
only. Trying to add oil is next to impossible without sloping it on to other
engine parts, due to the air cleaner and low over head of the engine
compartment.

The obvious fix is a funnel and or hose and funnel.  both of which ar
inconvenient.  I have not seen an oil filler  that faces the back  of the
bus (this would require an 90 degree turn on the filler neck), but that
doesn't mean they aren't available.  Any suggestions.


This is a small matter, but when I read about peoples irks with the seat
belts ( they are a bit of a pain) I thought maybe suggestions would be
availbale.

Thanks
I LOVE my bus.
