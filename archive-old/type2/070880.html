Subject: Weber Conversion Accelerator Tips for '72-74 VW Bus
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey folks,

I have a 1973 Camper Bus with a 1700 or 1800cc engine.  Recently, I had my 
dual carbs replaced by a Single Carb, Dual barrell carborator.  Yes there are 
some drawbacks, but compared to what I had, and how much it would have cost 
to try to replace (not to mention FIND) these parts, I have found this to be 
a pretty decent comprimise.

There are a couple of issues that came up that I'd like to pass along to 
folks on the VW Bus list who are considering this conversion.  I have a great 
mechanic, Greg Malany of Greg's Repair Service in Natick, MA.  He is the 
mechanic that installed this conversion.  

2 things I noticed immediately after the conversion were much more power than 
what I previously had, and uneven and jumpy response to the accelerator 
pedal.  Within 2 days, I couldn't start the vehicle unless I kept pumping the 
gas pedal, and when I would let it go, it would immediately konk out.   What 
happened?   2 things:

1. The rubber gaskets that come with the conversion kit was inferior.  These 
are the rubber gaskets that attach the manifold pipe conversions that come 
with the kit to the new carborator.

2. When I pressed on the gas pedal, it actually pulled on the carborator 
enough that it let air leak into the carb.

Greg did a great job of taking care of both:  He replaced the inferior rubber 
gaskets (that come with the kit) with a much better quality pair of gaskets 
and he mounted a metal bar to the carborator and mounted the other end of 
this metal piece to the engine block to that the carborator would not rock.  
He also readjusted the carborator for better performance.   

All this helped tremendously, but I still had the problem that the my gas 
pedal was very touchy and the acceleration uneven.  Something didn't feel 
right, so I inspected the entire carb set up one afternoon and found that 
acceleration problem was caused because the new carb acelerator linkage, 
where you attach the end of the accelerator cable, did not line up as well as 
it did with the origianal carbs and the accelerator cable was pulling from an 
angle.  What would happen is the engine would go from an idle (about 950 
rpms) to 3000+ rpm instantly, with no middle ground.  This was happening 
because as I would press on the gas pedal it would apply tension to the 
accelerator cable, and because it was attached on an angle, it would suddenly 
pull the linkage forward, rather than having a smooth pull if it were 
directly in line.   I kept buring rubber, stalling out, or the bus would buck 
uncontrollably because of this.  Greg told me that for some reason the angle 
didn't line up exactly on the 1972 - 1974 series busses, but was fine on all 
other busses he had installed this on.

I tried one modifcation that helped.  After a while, this proved to be 
somewhat unsatisfactory, so I made some further modifications that made the 
acceleration smooth, reliable, and made me feel like I had a whole new bus.  

Here is what I did: To correct the angle problem, I removed the end of the 
accelerator cable that was directly screwed into the carborator linkage.  To 
the end of this cable, I tied about a 2 foot length of strong twisted strand 
type wire, to extend the length of the accelerator cable.  Next I bought a 
small metal pulley, about an inch and a half in length (you can pick them up 
in any hardware store) and threaded the extended accelerator wire through 
this.  Next I tied another piece of the twisted strand wire from the 
accelerator linkage at the back of the carborator to the pulley (leaving 
about a 4&quot; length between the linkage and the pulley).  Next I drilled a 
small hole in the edge of the engine compartment opening where hatch fits 
that allows you to access the engine from above.  (I drilled this in the 
grove, where the rubber fits keeps the fumes out of the cab).  Next I slowly 
pulled the extended accelerator cable through the hole until it was snug 
enough to pull against the pulley and enough to start pulling on the 
accelerator linkage.  At that point, I tied the extended accelerator cable to 
the hole.    

That was it.  From then on, I've had great response, and like I said, it was 
like having a whole new vehicle.

Keep in mind that where you drill this hole for the extended accerator cable 
will depend on the angle of the cable that is tied from the pulley to the 
carb linkage.  This must be lined up as straight as possble to acheive best 
results.

If anyone has any questions or needs this clarified or simplified, I'd be 
glad to do this.  Either email me at Ricciotti_at_aol_dot_com, or phone me at (617) 
524-4732, not after 10pm please.  Ask for Chris Ricciotti.   

Hope this information will be helpful to someone else!
