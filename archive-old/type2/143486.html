Subject: Aftermarket heater control boxes?

Has anyone used the aftermarket heater control boxes as sold by cip or others? What is the quality like? I've just discvoered that the &quot;chimney&quot; or mushroom on top of mine are rusted through. Does this affect their performance?? I still haven't quite determined what this is for.
