Type 2 '81 air-cooled Vanagon, Western Massachusetts. Asking $1500, 
negotiable. Body in solid shape, engine runs but needs work. 
I'm hoping to sell it before I move across the country in two 
weeks! This much-loved bus appeared in the February '98 Valentines' Day 
special of &quot;The Tick&quot; comic book.
