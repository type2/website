&gt; He writes &quot;as is&quot; on the bill of sale. I ask him about this and
&gt; he says&quot; you have to remember this is a 30 year old vehicle,
&gt; so things can happen,

That's a very true word and the crux of the matter. Any time you buy a
vehicle like this from a private individual you will buy &quot;as is&quot;.

Always assume the worst. In most cases you will only be able to check the
general condition of the bus visually and should decide whether or not you
want this one even if it has a catastrophic failure of some sort the next
day.

On the plus side: have the engine fixed by a reputable person and you know
you'll have a reliable car and somebody to fall back on.

If you want 3 year / 60.000 miles warrenty on a bus you'll have to get
yourself a brand new one.
