Subject: Re: [T2] Re: What's your MPG

I am trying to drive my '74 a bit slower at highway speeds, but during 
a long trip I sometimes find myself pushing 80.

I have an oil temp gauge and would notice the engine temps would slowly 
get higher and higher the longer I drive.  The temps would get to 280 
and didn't want to go down even when I backed off.  I'm not sure if I 
have some other issue, but I resolved the problem by installing an oil 
cooler with electric fan.  I can now drive 80 and keep the temp to 
220-230, but like I said, I'm trying to slow down and stay within the 
posted limits.

&gt; My opinion (admittedly not directly supported) is that the lower
