&gt; Doesn't Bus Boys have them?  The last one I bought, I got from the VW
&gt; dealer.  They had them in-stock, even.  (Probably because the same part
&gt; was used on early Vanagons.)
&gt;

NLA at Bus Boys per web site, Guess I should call.


&gt; &gt; Also looking for two latches that hold the engine hatch closed.

&gt; I think your best bet is to hit a junkyard for these.
&gt;
The only yard near Flagstaff Az that does anything with buses other than 
crush them, gives them all to one guy in trade for his work on their cinder 
buggies (volcanic equivelant of dune buggy). I quit doing business with him 
after a SOUR deal.
