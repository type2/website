Subject: late model alt. switch

While thumbing through JCWhitney today(i know) i noticed that the
alternators for the early model watercooled cars(75-82 rabbit, 77-80
dasher) look exactly the same as the 38 amp ones in the 71 westy bus. 
Is it possible that these could be swapped?  does anyone know the
amperage of these alternators? the alternator has the threaded portion
in the front for the pulley and also in the back for the fan.  I would
love to have even a few more amps to work with.  I also noticed that
Rocky mount. carries a 210$ 55 amp alternator conversion kit for my
car.  the alternator in JCw is 75$--maybe even cheaper from a junkyard
then rebuilt.
