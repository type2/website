Subject: Re: [T2] HELP ME !!!

Find a good used engine block.
Have it inspected by a machinist, free or cheap.
Have them cold tank it to clean it, $35 or so.
Buy a Bentley for procedures. Borrow or buy a Muir to put it in layman's 
terms for you if need be.(~$50)
Muir can help you identify parts, Bentley will tell you how to put it together.
Buy some basic tools and buy or borrow a good click style torque wrench. (~$50)
Move everything from your current engine block to that engine block. (~$100 
- gasket kit)
Now if you don't think you can do it - I say you can do it. (priceless)

I pulled my engine apart about 5 years ago. Before I could build it back, I 
nearly lost my life to a tractor accident. I did lose the use of two 
fingers for several months. My wonderful wife reassembled my engine for me, 
and my friends helped me reinstall it. I runs wonderfully to this day.

Go for it!!!
