 What is the saying? &quot;for every mouse you see there are 50 you don't see&quot;  well
the same goes for rust, if you see a little there is usually a lot there that you
just can't see.
    Usually if you can see a little rust on the bottom of your wind shield it
means there is quite a bit of rust beneath the windshield rubber.
I had to have mine pulled out, they sand blasted it primer-sealed it and put it
in with a new window rubber.
    The sooner you get this job done the better since rust only gets worse with
time.  I am sure that people on this list will have excellent advice on how to
pull out the window and do the rest of the work.  I was to scared to do it.  A
friend of mine bought a bus with no windshield because the PO had cracked three
trying to get a new one back in.
    Anyway my main advice from experience:
-The sooner you do this job the better, but get everything together so surprises
are kept to a minimum
-be prepared to get reamed out if you pay to have this done ($700-mine didn't
look bad at all but the whole bottom channel was rusted out and new pieces had to
be welded in)
-find someone you can trust to do a quality job because I can see little rust
spots and it hasn't been more then a year.

Maybe this is something you can take on with a couple of friends...good luck!
