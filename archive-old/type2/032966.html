All listees:

I thought I'd weigh in with my experiences with Dawn and PLF.  I've found
Dawn and the folks at PLF to be highly trustworthy, their products of top
quality and their prices very reasonable.  A few months back I was looking
for a new spare tire cover for my '79 westy.  I had to send my old one in
(on faith) so that they could use it as a template.  It took several weeks,
but I received a new cover that was of much better quality and workmanship
than my original.  My brother Ed also ordered and received a lovely new
orange poptop canvas for his '74 and it was also of top quality.

I guess that my point here is that we need more people like Dawn and PLF to
keep our busses alive.  I think &quot;the benefit of the doubt&quot; might be in
order here to let some things work themselves out.

Just my 2 piasters worth.
