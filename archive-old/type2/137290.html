&gt;For those who carry a vehicle inside the truck: how do you tie it down? Asking, b/c I don't know. The only tie downs I have seen were along the walls and suitable for appliances and furniture.

A truck made for hauling a vehicle inside it will have tie downs on the 
floor for the purpose of bracing the wheels. DO NOT PUT YOUR CAR INSIDE 
YOUR UHAUL TRUCK. Even if you can put it in there, you have absolutely 
nothing to keep it there. Spend the money to rent the right truck, or 
hire someone who does.
