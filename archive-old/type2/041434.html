Subject: California to refund out-of-state vehicle smog fees

Good news from Sacramento for all listees who paid a $300 fee to register a 
49-state vehicle in California between 1990 and 1998. The &quot;smog impact fee&quot; 
was ruled illegal in July 1998 but it wasn't until last Thursday that the 
Governor signed into law a bill granting refunds to the 1.7 million 
motorists who paid the fee. The refunds will average $400 each with 
interest. 260,000 people have applied for refunds and the state is said to 
be working to locate others, including those who have since relocated out of 
state. Checks will begin to roll out October. To get a form to apply for a 
refund, write to the DMV, Registration Operations Division, P.O. Box 
825391-S, Sacramento, CA 94232-5391
