Hey, what about making a dog-leg down here to Oz?

Down the east coast from Cairns to Sydney to Melbourne, there should be
plenty of busses and easy stages.

Melbourne to Adelaide, where I am, is half-way along the bottom of
Australia, facing Antarctica (brrrrr - winter here).
That could be a bit more challenging, and I haven't seen any Bussers on the
list, but a bit of promotion in regional newspapers might get some new
members.

&gt;From here, north a few hundred miles is the Indian-Pacific railway (links
the Pacific and Indian Oceans).  Then there's a thousand or so  miles of
desert to Perth on the Indian Ocean.  Not too many busses on that stretch. 
Or anything else.  The flat-car idea sounds good!
