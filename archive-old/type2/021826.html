Subject: bent up AFM on 76

the bent part actuates your fuel pump.

bend it back so that when air just starts flowing through
the meter, the reed contacts on the lower left side of your picture
are forced close.

with the key on, you can manually close these contacts and you should
be able to hear the fuel pump run. if you can't you have problems.

I can think of a handful of reasons of why this might actually be done
to the AFM.  Adjust it back the way it's supposed to be and see how it
runs.
post again if it doesn't run correctly.
 
you'll want the fuel pump to come on with basically any movement of the
AFM,
usually the bar will be about 1/16 from contacting the reed at rest with
no
air flow through it.


good luck

matt
