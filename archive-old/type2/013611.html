The hose is just a push on hose but it is high preassure fuel injection
hose. Replace only with fuel injection hose and you can either leave the
little collar in place or toss it. You may want to use a clamp on both
ends of the new hose.
An engine compartment fire pretty well messes up all your vacume, fuel
and wiring.

&gt; The short piece of hose from one of the injectors to the fuel ring is 
&gt; 
&gt; cracked. It sprays fuel when touched.
&gt; 
&gt; I have not yet pulled the injector, but it looks like the hose is 
&gt; swagged or is otherwise hard fixed on to the injector.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I replace that hose or should I buy a new injector?
