Subject: RE: [T2] What about diesel conversions?

FYI,

Snoopy of Full Moon Bus Club fame recently converted a '74 Riviera to diesel
using a Fox engine.  Not sure if it is currently veggie-powered, it has been
quite a saga getting it running, plus it sounds like the bus was parked for
a long time before the conversion so it had all the other stuff to fix also.
