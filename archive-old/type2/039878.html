Subject: Cleaning Water Containers

I would go with a bleach-and-water solution to clean the water tank. 
Mine's not aluminum (it's plastic), but I use this method on it and it
works great.  I use a ration of about a 2 or 3 ounces bleach per 5 gallons
water (same ratio that I use for sanitizing my homebrew equipment).  I fill
the tank up with the bleach/water combo, drive her around the block a few
times to slosh the solution around in there a bit, then come home and
fill/drain/fill her with warm water several times to rinse and clean the
bleach out of there.  Once I feel that the tank is clean and free of
bleachiness (that is, when the smell of bleach is no longer apparent), I
fill it with clean cold water and that is it.  I was advised early on NOT
to use any kind of soap or sudsy cleaner in the tank, as it would be nearly
impossible to remove the suds (ever try to rinse out a dishsoap bottle?) --
and I extend the same advice to you.  The bleach/H2O route works well.
