Subject: friday $$$ comparison question
Mime-Version: 1.0

since it IS friday....

what is the average $$ people spend on their beloved vw vehicles?

i was lucky enough to not have to pay for the purchase of my bus, but i 
have certainly paid since the day i brought it home.

from the new canvas and used fridge/stove....stereo equip, new front seats, 
all new door seals...to the ENTIRE front and rear suspension, i have to 
date (totaling 6 months of ownership) spent $3200 and will probably spend 
another $300 on gauges and a few more appointments.  this is more than i 
have paid and put into my h*nda prelude ('89.)  yet the satisfaction is 
greater.  the only thing i haven't touched is the &quot;newer&quot; engine, trans. 
and body.  (i think i'll allow my bank account to replenish before i take 
on the paint job.  i would like to DRIVE it at some point.)

it is amazing that i love this bus SO much, so much, that i have only 
driven it ONCE.  yup, that's right.  i drove it once with &quot;renegade&quot; 
license plates in the middle of the night (and broke off the accelerator 
pedal that night too...ooops!)  since then, he has been torn apart left and 
right (obviously not a daily driver yet...mainly a daily &quot;taking up space 
in the boyfriend's parents' driveway.)&quot;

he is still on jack stands, awaiting the reattachment of his torsion arms 
(with new ball joints) and new tie rods and everything else underway.  now, 
if the weather would just hold up on the weekends so that i can work on it!!!

now for the general and HUGE thanks i give to this list.  without you, it 
just wouldn't be the same...or as easy.  (did i say easy?  hmmm.)
