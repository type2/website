uh...maybe this is a dumb question....but my brake fluid resevoir seal
is leaking where it connects to the hose.  I was just going to epoxy it
because I can't find another seal....not even on junker busses!  Will
the epoxy react with the brake fluid in any way??
And can I just epoxy my door vents together.....just a little...you know
where the heat flows through... mine is cracked and I just don't want
anybody putting their arm on it then hearing &quot;oops, sorry!&quot; that would
make me upset.  Any fixes for this sort of thing?

Oh yeah... to anyone in Wisconsin or the surrounding area....I found
ignition coils made by Wells in Fond du Lac for 14 bucks!!  90 day
warranty.  Even if it were to burn out after that....14 bucks!  I asked
the guy about them and he said they were good! just cheap cause they
were made locally.

Tull right?
