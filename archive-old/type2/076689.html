Subject: Re: [T2] splitting the main cooling duct

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... it is seriously stuck right around that casting.  It
is split everywhere else and there are no screws.  When I try and stick
a screwdriver between the part where that casting is, it won't crack the
seal.  the dipstick part is kinda loose, so that's moving, but the other
area just won't budge...

I'll do one more look-over to make sure there are no more screws, and
then I'll try and pry it apart.  I just don't want to crack it!

Thanks,
Mike

&gt; Mike,

&gt; IIRC, the sleeve doesn't come out, but the two duct halves separate at an
&gt; angle, i.e. approx. 45 degrees or the angle of the dipstick sleeve.  The
&gt; sleeve remains attached to one of the halves.  They don't simply come apart
&gt; but the you pull one half of the housing up and push the other down, sort
&gt; of...
&gt; 
&gt; The thing is one o'clock is an alignment casting, I'm pretty sure.  I didn't
&gt; have to do anything with it when I got mine apart, so that's probably not
&gt; the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck.  Once the thing comes apart, you'll see much more clearly what
&gt; I'm trying to describe.

&gt; Subject: [T2] splitting the main cooling duct
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do I have to drive the oil dipstick sleeve out of the ducting before I
&gt; &gt; can split it?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, if you're looking at the hole where the cooling fan is (the big
&gt; &gt; hole in the middle of the ducting), just up to the right of the opening,
&gt; &gt; at about 1 o'clock, there is a little plug that looks like it's either a
&gt; &gt; screw that was sawed off or an alignment hole.  It's about an inch or so
&gt; &gt; from edge of the big circle opening.  Do other people have a screw
&gt; &gt; there?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems like the dipstick sleeve and this wierd plug thing/broken screw
&gt; &gt; are the only things keeping me from splitting the duct.  I'd like to get
&gt; &gt; in there, clean it out, and put it back together.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; btw, it's a 78 2.0 fi
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thanks,
&gt; &gt; MIke
