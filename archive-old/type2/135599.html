Subject: Re: [T2] Which year bus for resto.

I would say, off the top of my head, whatever you want. =D

Really!

Have you driven both types? How much do you want to spend to get a
powerful and reliable engine? The handling difference between a split
and bay is huge. Early bay / late bay, less so. Power? Well, if you're
dropping a few grand into an engine you can pretty much have good
reliable power for either type of engine. I'm partial to the Type 4
because it's a more robust design from the factory. But a well built
1776 or even 2.1 type 1 engine would be quite nice. Possibly earlier
R&amp;R, but not bad.

If you just want stock, then the late bays with the Type 4 engines are
the way to go. The HP numbers are really close to the later dual port
Type 1's, but the torque numbers on the Type 4 are more impressive (85
for the 1700 IIRC?)

71 and later bays had front disk brakes. If at all possible, I'd get
them. More forgiving, no adjustments, and &quot;kiss the windshield&quot;
stopping power. No VW experience on the all drum setups, but my
father-in-law has an old Ford truck with all drums and even after we
completely refurb'd the brakes there was no stopping on a dime. Maybe
stopping on a roll of them...

I guess your goal for the bus will really determine what candidate you
choose to start with.
