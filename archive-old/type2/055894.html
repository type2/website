Subject: ignition switch success story

Thanks to the advice of many list members  -  George Andrews in particular
- I managed to replace the ignition switch in my '71 Westy last week.
Working behind the instrument panel and underneath the steering column was
a first for me. As George suggested,  the job was tedious but doable.

The symptom which lead me to tackle the job was sudden stopping of the
engine accompanied by loss of all lamps on the dash.  These could be
restored by quickly rotating the key to a more favorable position.  It was
clear that I was losing the 12V which is needed at the coil to run the
engine.  I removed the electrical switch and found that the problem lay
there.  Continuity between terminals 30 and 50 was sporatic at best.  I
left the old cylinder in place and changed only the electrical switch.
Works well now.

Suggestions for the next member who might do this job.
        Not knowing the functions of  the key, lock cylinder,  and the
electrical switch , I purchased all three.  You should buy only the
electrical switch and not the lock cylinder.  It is hard for me to imagine
a malfunction that would necessitate replacing the cylinder.
        The instrument panel has to come off to expose the terminal block
for  the switch wires.  I struggled with how to detach the four  hot and
cold air levers to get it off.  I finally removed two 13mm nuts that hold
the set of four levers on their shaft.  The levers then dangled in the
panel slots and allowed me to flip the panel up onto the dadhboard as
suggested by George.
         By all means, unhook the wire from the negative terminal of the
battery.  I blew a fuse in the course of reinstalling the instrument panel.
There are dozens of wires and unprotected switch terminals back there just
waiting for one to touch another.

Jack
