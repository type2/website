Subject: clutch problem

Well, I tried to bleed the clutch with no success.  I still can't get it
into any gear.  You can feel the engine RPM lower as I try to push the gear
shift into any gear.  The shift lever seems fine as I can shift into gear OK
with the engine off.  I also assume the tranny is fine because of that.  Now
how do I determine if it the clutch itself or either the master or slave
cylinder?

Pat
