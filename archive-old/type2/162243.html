Subject: re: Mechanic referral

&gt; &gt; I'm going to be selling my 77 transporter to someone in the Agusta/N.
&gt; &gt; Agusta area of Georgia/South Carolina.  Does anyone know a VW mechanic
&gt; &gt; in that area I can refer him to?
&gt;
&gt; You mean Augusta, right?

And FWIW, mom takes all of her water pumpers to Billy in Statesboro these
days.  He's a good guy..I trust him with mom's cars. ;)   Mind you, she
splits her time between Statesboro and Augusta a good bit, so the drive is
fine.

I can't recall his address or number, but I can get it...
