I relocated to Nashville, TN in order to go to school at nashville
auto-diesel college :)
	Fun, fun, fun... I was down at an import FLAPS the other day (roy
rogers import parts) and spoke to Red Pinkerton, the local (?)
organizer/honcho of the Volunteer State Volkswagen Association. Anyways,
they're supposed to be getting together on the 21st of March at
Piccadilly's (a cafeteria/restaurant, I suppose) to meet. 
	Otherwise, any Nashville area listees who want to go out for
coffee/waffle house/vw bs session... I'd be up for that.
