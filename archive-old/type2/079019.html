Subject: Re: [T2] Singlecab Sighting

Nah can't say I've tried it b/c my best computer is the one that I use at 
work and it does not have a DVD either....

ZAPGRAB has done pretty good otherwise though. Liked the price of course.

Don't know how it does what it does.

&gt;Hi Chris,
&gt;
&gt;Have you tried this yourself?  I've tried doing screen grabs in Windows 98,
&gt;Win2K and on Mac OS9 and 10.1; and none of these can grab a frame.
&gt;
&gt;The problem is that the DVD drive overlays the video signal onto a special
&gt;shade of black, and it does so on the video card hardware, not at the OS
&gt;level. So all the screen dump contains is a nice empty black box.
&gt;
&gt;If Zapgrab can get into the video card memory I'll be very impressed. I'm
&gt;not saying it *can't* work, just that I've never seen it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Happy trails,

&gt; &gt; Play it on a computer and use ZAPGRAB (small computer utility that is free
&gt; &gt; and wonderful) to take a snapshot (copy and paste) of the screen (or
&gt; &gt; whatever portion of it) and paste it into a document of any format.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; PS how do you get a digital picture off a DVD?
&gt; &gt;&gt; I could put the telly into pause &amp; take a picture of the screen but 
&gt; that does
&gt; &gt;&gt; not sound too good!
