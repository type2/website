Subject: clutch parts...offered to the list first.

Folks,

I scored some nice clutch disks and pressure plates at an auction
last weekend.  I wanted to offer them to the list first as I believe
these are &quot;smokin&quot; deals!

All look pretty good to me...although the pressure plates have some
very light surface rust in spots.

All disks are $27.00 + actual shipping 
3 215mm disks
2 210mm disks
1 228mm disk



1 210mm pressure plate &quot;made in WESTERN germany&quot; $90 
1 200mm pressure plate Brazilian $50
1 180mm pressure plate Sachs $25

Shipping price is actual cost from 72761 UPS or USPS although
I probably prefer UPS for the tracking number.

All can be seen here

Please respond off list.
First response to dbolen_at_shockwaverider_dot_com gets your part!
What you see is what you get.

Paypal ok, but add 2% to the total.  Otherwise a money order is fine.

Cheers, dave
