Subject: cleaning air plenum

I started replacing the remaining hoses in the engine compartment that were
left.  I'm also replacing the gasket block and FI seals.  The little seals
were totally cracked, the big ones no problems.  The hose from the right
fuel rail to the pressure regulator has no cracks surprisingly.

Anyway, I noticed the intake runners weren't too clean given that pretty
much only filtered air is going through them.  One was very rusty and other
was slightly greasy with rust underneath.

With everything off the top of the engine is it worth cleaning the air
plenum?  I can't see in too well, put a poked my finger and it's a little
grimy inside.  There seems to be some plates in their so I figure it not
going to be easy to clean.
