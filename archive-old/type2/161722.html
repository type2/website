Hi Guys

It's been a while but you helped me great deal when rebuilding my type 2, so 
here goes, twenty two hours and one very frustrated man later......
Hi Guys

I have a friends bug (1300 twin port) stuck on my drive, it idles fine and 
under slow accelaration in picks up fine, problem is if you put it under 
load (foot to floor), it mises for a second or so before picking up, in an 
attempt to sort this I have

replaced plug, condensor, points, ht leads, dizzi cap, set valves, replaced 
carb diagphram, checked and topped up float, new hose to heat exchanger from 
oil bath,  disconnected automatic choke in case problematic

Im all out of ideas, the only thing i can possibly think is that the fuel 
pump is weak and it;s emptying the float and not being replaced quik enough?

i know it's not exactly bus related but you guys so good last time i thought 
id ask

Thanks again
