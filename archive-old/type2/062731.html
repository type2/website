&gt; am glad to know there are options.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's another compressed-air related question, kinda: How many of you out
&gt; there have painted your busses yourselves (show of hands please)? How many
&gt; of you who painted them yourself had never done such a thing before? After
&gt; my carb's rebuilt, my cargo floor is all welded and about a million other
&gt; things are done, I want a new coat of paint on my 70. I can't decide whether
&gt; to go with a cheapo Maaco job or do it myself. This is a loaf, so I have no
&gt; pretensions of future resale value (you know the ad: '68 bus, perfect, new
&gt; paint, rebuilt engine, $8,000). I'm  just gonna drive the wheels off the
&gt; thing.
&gt; 
&gt; So: DIY, or Maaco?

I'd suggest you do both. Check w/ them for a quote first. They may 
not want to paint the inside of your rig. If they will, get a 
quote in writing. Then pre-prep your rig.

Remove the bumpers, headlamp rings, and anything else that will come 
off. When you get there, remove the rear lenses, license plate, etc. Rub 
all the rubber with a good rubber cleaner, so the tape will stick (if 
you know how, use some good tape, such as 3M, and mask off everything, 
including the rubber).
 
Before taking it in, get a sanding block, and some fine wet/dry 
sandpaper (most autoparts stores sell it). I'd recommend 400 grit or 
finer. First wash your rig, taking care to pressure wash all the cracks 
and crevices... especially in the wheel wells and under the van, to 
remove all traces of dust and dirt. Wash the entire rig 2 or 3 times, to 
be certain. Once it's clean, use a bucket of soapy water, and keep your 
sandpaper moist (or use a garden hose and run water over the surface). 
With light pressure, sand all the paint surfaces smooth. Take care to 
&quot;feather&quot; all the chips out, and remove any &quot;orange peel&quot; from the 
surface. Don't rub hard, but let the paper do its job. Also, make sure 
to sand down into all those cracks and crevices.

Basically the difference between a good job and a poor job is 90% 
preparation, 10% application. I did this with a Chevette, I bought new 
in 1980. The &quot;factory&quot; paint peeled off. I had a $200 paintjob shot on 
the car... but because of the prep work, it would have cost $800 to 
$900 in any shop in town. My total investment was a sunny Saturday, and 
2 hours before delivery.

BTW, don't mask any surface more than 24 hours before painting, and be 
sure to keep it out of the rain and sun. When I dropped off my car, all 
they had to do was mask off the windshield, cover the wheels, and shoot 
it (about 30 minutes of their time). They made more money, and I got a 
better paint job, and everyone was happy.
