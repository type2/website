Subject: RE: [T2] Re: MORE paint questions

Let me just toss my rasta beanie in the ring here and suggest that there are a number of reasons for seeking a
&quot;less than optimal&quot; solution. If money is an issue, and God knows it is for me, then you have to make some hard
choices--

1) Let the bus rot until you can afford a &quot;correct&quot; paint job
2) Get a second job (and have less time to enjoy the bus) to pay for the &quot;correct&quot; paint job
3) Do a less than correct, but &quot;good enough&quot; paint job

Depending on the objective, Choice #3 might make the most sense. 

ON TOPIC--I wouldn't use Rust-O-Leum! I've heard that it has a fish oil base that prevents any sort of
overpainting. I'd search the archives for a no-rust auto primer and a good paint alternative.

For my own rusty bus I'm considering &quot;stabilizing&quot; the front window rust with Eastwood's Rust Encapsulator and
who knows, maybe rattle-can paint over that. Tractor paint sounds interesting, maybe that.  I plan to
experiment with something that won't be a horrible match for the Bright Orange. Someday I hope to be able to
replace the entire nose section and do the job &quot;right.&quot; But someday is not here now and I'd rather do a &quot;good
enough&quot; job than do nothing.

In Cybernetics terms this is called &quot;satisficing.&quot; It is different from a &quot;cob job&quot; because one strives for the
highest quality, all the while recognizing that the results may be less than optimal. Source:

&gt; But, if you have a roach to start with and just want to feel better
&gt; about
&gt; your ride for the short amount of time left before it goes back to the
&gt; earth, go for it. Paint it up to suit your fancy. Hand painted Busses
&gt; have a lot of character.
