Subject: thermostat

Hmmm...another &quot;discovery&quot; on our new '78 bus.  I don't think there's a 
thermostat.  I removed the p-side lower engine tin and don't see signs 
of anything--no bracket, no cable, no thermostat, oh boy.  What started 
as a check of the thermo's operation is turning into a big job.  The 
good news, I guess, is that the rod spring is present and holding the 
flaps full open.

Does anyone have a link to a photo of what everything should look like? 
  And/or a really good description?  I have a Bentley on order, 
hopefully it will help.  Finally, does this list from busdepot_dot_com look 
like I'll have everything I need to install?

Thermostat Bracket Washer
Thermostat Cable
Thermostat Cable Pulley
Thermostat Cable Sealing Washer
Thermostat Bracket
Thermostat Cable Union Nut
Thermostat
Thermostat Assy Screw

Thanks, I'd guess this is pretty critical as winter approaches in 
Montana.

thanks,
joe broach
