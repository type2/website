Subject: FS:  Complete Westfalia Camper Interior

Complete interior from a green '78 Westfalia for sale.  Includes 
sofabed, all cabinets, sink, icebox, table, woodgrain paneling and 
trim, etc. etc. etc. Just about everything from the front seats 
back, except for the front seats themselves.  All in decent shape.  
Anyone out there looking to put a camper interior in their bus, or 
upgrade their camper to a newer or cleaner interior?  Would much 
prefer to sell complete, but would consider splitting up if I can't 
sell it complete.  Asking $350 for everything.  Located between 
Phila. and Allentown, Pa.  E-mail or (610) 754-8989.
