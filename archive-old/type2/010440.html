&gt; I was good and read the archives before I posted this, it did answer

&gt; modifications would be needed. If their are any, what? I plan on
&gt; rebuilding
&gt; the pancake engine if it is bad when I get to check it out. I have an
&gt; extra
&gt; upright 1600 dp that I could install for the short term. This will

&gt; the decision to purchase this bus or not.
&gt; Thanks for any help.

Yes, it can be done, and in fact it was done from the factory for
European delivery, as some countries had preferential tax structures
for small displacement engines.  The engine tin is somewhat different,
so the trick is to get the proper European tin to match your '72.  I
seem to recall that Bus Depot brought some over some time back so you
might see if they have any left.  Ronnie at http://www.type2parts_dot_com
might be able to help as well, as he has good connections with the
European tin benders.
