Subject: Re: [T2] distributor drive gear backwards situation

  I *think* (ouch) the &quot;binding&quot; Jason's talking about is the inability to turn the dizzy due to the vaccum  can hitting (Ratwell mentioned).  If it wasn't for that, I'd leave it as is.  But, I can't turn it any more counter clockwise and that's what it needs in order to be timed right.  My next stupid question is, can I pull out the drive gear and put it back in without the washer?  Only reason is that I'm afraid I'll drop it.
