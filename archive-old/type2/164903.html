Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot, KUDO'

&gt; many people complain when something doesn't go right, but I 
&gt; though I would also pass out a few Super Atta Boys' to the 
&gt; guys at Bus Depot.   I was putting in a new transmission and 
&gt; when I get the old one out I find that the CV boots are in a lot
&gt; worse shape than I thought, 3PM Monday a quick phone call to the
&gt; Bus Depot...paid for expidited service, was told I would get em 
&gt; Wed....  well at noon Tue!!! they were sitting on my doorstep.
&gt; 
&gt; probably saved me a full day in the swap out, GREAT JOB GUYS!!!



Bob, your post really made my day!  It is so rare to get a compliment - as
you said, most people are far more prone to post a complaint than a
compliment. (It irks me to no end when someone posts a gripe to the list,
and when I check their history I discover that their previous 10 orders went
flawlessly ... no mention of any of those, but the eleventh one that wasn't
perfect went righto the list.. :-)  I'll definitely pass this on to the
folks at the shop, so they know their extra effort is appreciated.
