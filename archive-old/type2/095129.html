Subject: HCBF 6 newspaper article

there was an article writen up in the Watauga Democrat on the Friday of the 
festival.  The author called buses &quot;bugs&quot; in the title, misquoted me, and 
misquoted the camping cost at 35 bucks in stead of 5 
bucks.............none-the-less a pretty good article

and a pretty bus Dave!!!

here is a link to article if you were not able to see the paper at the 
festival.
