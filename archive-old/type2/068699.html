Now I find there is also a leak at the tee-junction in the 
rear, where the single line running back splits to the 
left and right.

the leaks could be the fitting and/or the metal lines.  Can you clean them up
and then watch while the friend pumps the brakes?  I would look carefully for
any cracks.  As the bus is 32 years old, the metal lines are suspect, and may
well deserve to be replaced.   Then again,  only the outer  rear metal lines
were replaced on the 53, but that bus had been in a dry climate most of its
'life'.     You may find that stock VW lines are available, but you would
have to carefully bend them into shape.
