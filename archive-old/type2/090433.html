Subject: re: [T2] Stuck Lugs on the left rear of a 72

List,
May not be entirely relevant, but we ran into a
similar situation when removing the driver's side
tires on a 1963 Chrystler.  Apparently, the factory
had installed reversed threaded studs on the left side
of the vehicle.  After shearing off two of the studs,
we removed the drum and took it to the tire shop where
they recognized the reverse threading and the nuts
spun off easily.  Before damaging the studs, you may
want to try turning the lugs clockwise to see if that
is the culprit.  Unlikely, but given my recent
frustration with stuck lugs, I thought I would pass it
on.
