As someone who once worked in the International Clearance area for a major
overnight shipping company based in Memphis, TN, I know for a fact that
packages are only spot checked.  And the amount of them even spot checked
depends greately upon the frame of mind that the customs inspectors are in
at the time.  THe chances of your package or shipment being assesed duties
are about 1 in 15 or 20.  But that is only with one shipper at one point of
entry.  Probably holds try most everywhere else also.

Of course, you ARE duty bound, as an American citizen, to report any duties
that are due if you are not assesed any!  HA!

&gt;&gt;&gt; But these questions aside, I've been wondering just how easy or
&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult it is to buy stuff mail-order from outside the U.S.
&gt;
&gt;and Harmon responded:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I've ordered stuff from Europe with no problems before. [..snip..]
&gt;&gt;It's no different than buying mailorder in the US. Actually, buying
&gt;&gt;&gt;from net dealers is quite a bit safer than buying from regular mail
&gt;&gt;order places [...]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Harmon:
&gt;
&gt;I wasn't concerned so much about the safety/security of buying from net
&gt;dealers - it was the potential for U.S. Customs hassles that had me
&gt;wondering.
&gt;
&gt;Someone did finally respond to me on a newsgroup:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;I bought many parts from the UK - if they ship UPS or regular Post,
&gt;it's almost automatic.  The box just shows up at your door, no problem.
&gt;Dunno if there's a limit on value for this type of shipment, but I've
&gt;gotten $300+ boxes no problem.  You can't ship assembled engines though,
&gt;due to EPA regs.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;It was looking at the Riechert Tuning, site and some of the goodies that
&gt;they offer, which got me to thinking about this (again).
&gt;
&gt;I still don't know how import duties (if any) are handled.  Visiting the
&gt;U.S. Customs Service web site only leads one off into the fog.
