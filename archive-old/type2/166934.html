Subject: What year is my bus?

Volks,
  I am the rpoud owner of what I thought was a 1972 riviera, but I am 
not sure that it really is a 72.
   
  Did the 72 bus have the access hatch to the engine, the one inside 
the bus that is over the engine?
   
  Did it have the high-back seats with headrests?
   
  I know things like seats can get swapped so this isnt such a 
tell-tale sign.
  What otrher things can I look at besides the vin to know?
   
  The vin plate that is inside the engine compartment has obviously 
been changed and welded in, poorly. But it matches what is on the dash and 
the title says 72.
   
  The VIN is 2322140006
   
  Also what engine do I have? The number on the fan housing is GD006046
  Where else can I look at the engine for a number?
..
   
  Thanks,
  Ed
