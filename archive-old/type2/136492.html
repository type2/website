Subject: Re: [T2] '71 Air Oil Bath Warm/Cool Flow Control Gizmo

Hi -

For whatever it's worth, as I understand it, the only purpose of heating
intake air is to prevent carburetor icing.  So, that device wouldn't improve
your Bus's performance under normal circumstances -- indeed, you actually get
less horsepower with hot air than you do with cold -- but it could keep your
Bus from running extremely poorly or quitting entirely due to carb ice when
the right combination of temperature and humidity presents itself.

Unfortunately, I've never had the pleasure of needing to fix this gadget on my
'71 Bus, so I can't advise you in that regard.

Cheers,

- Miles
