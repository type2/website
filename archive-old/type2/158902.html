Subject: Re: [T2] troubles

Seems that the new filter fixed it.  I've got a 1.7 single carb.  My last fuel pump failed on a Sunday and the only one I could get quick was at A-zone.  Turns out it is heftier than the others I've used, much quieter, and has a lifetime warranty.  I think it cost $37.  Can't even hear it in the cabin.  I'm anxious to see how long it lasts but it's been over a year already.  I put a filter on each side of it for protection.  Now if I could figure out the oil leak.  It's got so much under it, it's hard to isolate the spot.  I guess it's the cold weather that started it.  Maybe it will go away when it warms up.  Nah, not with my luck.  Cheers...KR

ticking away tells me you're not running FI so it is
more susceptible to a drop of water now and then
(continuous flow keeps water suspended better.) Hows
the cap and elbow? -BaH PS Is it icing up?
