Subject: Re: [T2] Split CV boots: Can they last 2 weeks?  

Don, are you talking about split CV boots as in &quot;torn, bad boots&quot;, or 
are you talking about those quick-fix boots with a seam in them?  If 
it's the former, I'm in agreement with everyone else here.  If the 
latter .. while they're not the best in the long run, anything is an 
improvement over shot boots for a roadtrip.

Just trying to clarify things so we're all on the same page and not 
comparing apples to kumquats.
