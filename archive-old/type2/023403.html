Your description sounds like overheating, which is way too common on busses, 
and/or preignition, another problem &quot;newbies&quot; suffer from.  
The head with the &quot;fused&quot; exhaust valve sounds like a lost cause.  Replace 
all of the P&amp;C's.  Be sure to check the compression ratio before you bolt on 
the heads.  When you assemble you engine make sure there are no vacuum leaks.
Once you get it running again check to make sure the air:fuel ratio is not 
too lean.
Use a grade of fuel that will not cause preignition.  Preignition will 
destroy your engine in a matter of minutes.
Good Luck
