Subject: Misc Part Ident on 79

After spending last night cleaning a few more parts of my 2 liter I have
some questions about some possibly missing seals/etc. This is all on a
FI 2L 79 motor.

1. There is a sheet metal part that mounts in front of the alternator &amp;
is held in place on one side w/ said alternators mounting bolt. I'll
call this part &quot;a&quot;. Should part &quot;a&quot; have any sort of gasket/seal between
itself and the aluminum fan housing? Mine just had a lot of silicone
sealant by the PO. 

2. Where the oil dipstick penetrates part &quot;a&quot; should there be any sort
of seal? Once again silicone here by PO.

TIA
