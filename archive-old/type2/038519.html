Subject: Re: Secrets for Removing Slotted Plugs?

Arrghhhh!!!  Some people and their loctite!

I don't know a way of safely removing these... especially if someone used the 
&quot;more permanent&quot; type of loctite... we had this problem at work, and could 
*not* remove the grade 5 bolt come hell or high water... turns out someone 
used the &quot;studlocker&quot; version (green in a little tube).  I *did* find out, 
tho, that you can shear the bolt head off on one of these given enough 
persuasion.

We ended up drilling and helecoiling and reinstalling.  It was a good thing 
we had no idea who did that; they would have been hung by their thumbs by 3 
*very* pissed mechanics and one really sore lady (me).

My advice - try a screwdriver, but be prepared to take it off (I am assuming 
it's on the head?) and to a machinist.  And huge good luck to you!
