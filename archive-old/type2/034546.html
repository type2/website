Subject: Ness-Tek page updates

Hi folks,

I just updated the Ness-Tek page at type2_dot_com (get there by clicking the 
Ness-Tek button at type2_dot_com or go directly: 
http://type2_dot_com/rvanness/index.htm ).  The page has been renovated and 
received some new items (including photos and a compression ratio 
calculator Excel spreadsheet).  Bookmark and check back over the next few 
weeks for new material--Dale and Caspar have a couple articles in the works.

Ron
