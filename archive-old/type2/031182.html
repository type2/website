&gt; I'm thinking about a trailer hitch for Itch (69 Westy). My boat/trailer
&gt; weigh a total of about 850 pounds.
&gt; 
&gt; I also don't want to drill and cut a bunch of visible areas to mount a
&gt; hitch.
&gt; 
&gt; What hitches have what mount points? Pictures? Close-ups?

some years ago I bought a bumper hitch from a rental place, same hitch you
get when you rent a U-Haul and such, just put it on when I need it and
take it off otherwise.  have probably overloaded it a few times hauling
stuff to the dump.

Just make sure your bumper mounts are solid
