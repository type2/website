Subject: 1600 in a vanagon

Subject says it all. I have a perfectly good 82 vanagon with all FI gone and
a bastard engine. No one wants to buy it and figured I would make a grocery
getter out of her. I know they put 1600s in them in other countries. Upright
cooling setup will not fit.

I have seen a type III in the neighborhood being cut up after a crash.
Thought I'd stop and see what that engine is like.

Has anyone on this list done this? How hard would it be? Will engine bolt up
OK? Any cooling tin available?

I was hoping someone would need a good vanagon body after a crash and do the
engine swap, but has been on the type II buy/sell with lots of questions but
no takers.

Any input appreciated in advance. I know will be slow and under powered, so
skip those comments. Not planning any cross country trips. :-)
