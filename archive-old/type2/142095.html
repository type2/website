Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Gas Cap

Since we are on this topic, I've a question related to this same 
thread:

I've a 1969 which has the original VW Gas Cap. It even has a huge VW 
raised-stamped on the cap. I don't want it stolen, and I don't want my 
gas stolen. Its an easy shot to fill your tank from mine.

So my question is: where can I get a locking replacement?

I've checked my FLAPS and they don't sell them. I went to BAP and same 
story. Grrrr! Any help out there??
