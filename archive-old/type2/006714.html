&gt;In the engine bay of my 1978 2-litre camper there is a fan above the
&gt;engine that has two outlets, it appears that they each go to one of the
&gt;heat exchangers...is this a booster fan??? I can't find any mention of
&gt;it in the handbook, but it it is there in all the pictures...and how
&gt;does it work, is there a seperate switch, or a thermo switch..

Had one like that in my '73.  It was the blower for the heaters.  Draws 
air from the engine compartment and sends in past the heat exchangers to
heat it up, then up to the front of the bus to exit thru the inside vents 
and warm the passengers.  The blower came on when I moved the little red
tipped heater handles on the dash to turn the heat on.
