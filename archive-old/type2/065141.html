Subject:Mysterious FI hoses...where they go?

hey now,

well, in my well intentioned effort to clean my engine, i've knocked two hoses
off and can't figure out where they go.

hose #1...regular vaccum hose with clear hose attached. this hose fits on a Y
connection. part of the line of this Y connection goes to an apparatus that
is situated on the right side of the engine against the firewall.

 ----- firewall   then a hose comes out to form a Y. the left branch goes to
  [ ]             a circular object next to the coil wire/distributer. i can't
   |&lt;---hose      figure out where the right side goes. it's a regular vacuum
  / \             like hose except it has a clear hose attached to it.
                  definite suction on it. engine doesn't idle as fast when i
                  put my finger over the opening.

hose 2: just a clearish brown hose that is plugged at one end. have no idea
where it goes.
