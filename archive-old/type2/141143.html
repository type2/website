&gt;    Should Teri Hatcher get honorary type 2 membership...?-)
 
 Teri Hatcher is suing a London newspaper for libel, claiming
they've been running a story that she's had sex with numerous
male friends in her VW van that she keeps parked outside her
LA home for that purpose...
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe it is a typo?  Is her defense 'one male friend numerous times'?
