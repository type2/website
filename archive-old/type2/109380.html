Subject: Re: [T2] parts from dealers

Unfortunately, the way VWoA treats its aircooled followers now days these
parts probably *will* be written off as scrap. On a good note I was able to
find some valve adjustment screws from my local  VW dealership the other
day. I bought all eight they had in stock. Pricey but if they are the
correct hardness I guess its worth it.

&gt; he suspected that vw might still have some of the old parts in the
&gt; inventory, but the new computer WILL NOT be listing them so they are
&gt; as good as NLA.
&gt; hopefully this means vw will at least sell the old stock to someone,
&gt; and not just write it off as scrap :P
