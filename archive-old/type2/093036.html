&gt;What are you doing to prevent sparks from jumping from the ends of your
&gt; &gt; spark plug wires when you do this?  Still much easier to remove the coil
&gt; &gt; hot wire and wrap it in a rag so it won't arc.  Other than that, this
&gt; &gt; method works fine.

Just unplug the coil from the 12v+ wire. The coil gets no power and 
anything that relied on the coil to get 12v+ can be jumpered together 
temporarily.

No spark to worry about.
