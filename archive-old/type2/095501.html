Subject: Bus F S/ peoples attitudes

    Is it only me or do other people find this.
  A friend of mine has been looking for a bus (Hatch top Westy or pop top)
in clean condition, what is with all these people trying to sell buses. You
ask for pics  and they say what you see is what you get (3 or 4 pics), got
any questions, e-mail me and I will answer them IF I have time), You ask if
you can have somebody come to look at it before making the purchase and they
won't let you. You offer to send a throwaway camera to them to shoot pics
and they say they don't have time. My favorite response was YO BRO if you
like it buy it!  Have people attitudes changed that much? Are buses so
valuable that you need to just pay the price and take your chances. 
  Almost every hatch top he has inquired on people say I'm selling it so
cheap (8000 dollars or more), that I don't  have time to take any more pics
for you (like 5 pictures is enough to see what you would get)
  Come on, get real sellers, work with buyers, if you are so savey on what
you have you should be able to weed out the tire kickers and work with a
real buyer.
  I'm just HOT

So, if anybody out there has or knows of a Hatch top Westy for sale (no
projects) for sale, p-mail me and I will pass it on to my friend.

ps. When I bought my 63 flip seat the PO sent me ton's of pics and I also
got a complete slide show of it being taken apart. 
A great person to deal with
