Subject: re: Fuel lines

 Ralph,
  You missed a fuel line....  There is one directly above where the second 
 battery
  would go.  It is about halfway up and the rubber part is only a couple inches. 
  I
  think this space in the metal line was meant for the gas heaters but am 
unsure.


Peace Brother,
