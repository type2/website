&gt;I am still fixing/replacing lots of little items on my new '80 Westfalia.
&gt;One very crucial item I need is a lug wrench.  Apparently the PO had a
&gt;wrench which doesn't fit!  None of my sockets are large enough to fit the
&gt;nuts, so assuming all are stock (scary thought if they aren't) size, which
&gt;size wrench do I need?

the absolute BEST lug wrench for vanagons is a 19mm socket from sears
(get the 6-point kind) in 1/2&quot; drive, and their 20-something-inch breaker
bar (with the swivel head on the end). that gives you the most leverage
you can get. i THINK this will run you about $8 for the socket and $15 for
the bar.

the next best is a single-end lug wrench made by Vortec and usually sold
at vw parts departments. it has a handle that slides out to become about
two feet long. about $20. this one stores under the seat easily.

in my opinion. :)
