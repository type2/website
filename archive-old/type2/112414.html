Subject: 68 Baywindow Wheel Locked Up 

Hello,

  Yesterday I replaced the steering dampener and the drag link.  Vast
improvement in steering wheel play.  Now I want to allign my steering
wheel so the cross bars are at nine and three, not two and eight.  Was
told to take off the horn button and remove the nut in the center.  Pull
up on the steering wheel.  Then stick it back on, take a short cruise
until I have the bus going straight-dead-on-forward.  Stop the bus, do
not skip this step, and pull out the wheel and stick it in where I want
it.  Reassemble the collumn.

  Also, today while returning some tools I borrowed yesterday I had the
passenger side rear wheel brakes lock up.  I bled them again this
morning because I just couldn't get enough brake for my peddle.  It
didn't help, in fact, that particular wheel didn't bleed correctly, it
just kind of dribbled out.  I suspect the slave is the main culpret.  I
will take the wheel off later and see.

  Got in my first replacement door panels and kick plates today.  From
WCM, they look very nice.  I cannot install them until I find some sound
insulation for the doors.  Any Ideas that might not require ordering it
from somewhere?

Jennifer
