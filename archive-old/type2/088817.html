Subject: Re: [T2] Possible fuel injector problem??

[...]

&gt; if my injector is either clogged, or just bad? Is it
&gt; it big deal to take it out? Also, while I was back
&gt; there, I noticed something strange. Out of the same
&gt; wiring harness that the connectors for injectors 3 and
&gt; 4 come out, there is another connector that is
&gt; identical, but it isn't connected to anything - it
&gt; just hangs there. I cannot find anything that it could
&gt; be connected to. Does anyone know what this is?

 Take a very close look at those 3 connecters. The 2 for the injecters will be
grey. The 3rd one should be blue. It goes to the EGR valve. Time plays tricks
on the plastic and colors get muted....
