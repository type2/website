Subject: Another cracked head

 The continuing saga of &quot;Thrasher&quot;, the expedient van engine.

 recap: I was building a &quot;quick&quot; engine out of all the old parts 
laying around just to get this bus mobile in case of fire, floods etc.
 
 They are also trying to put me in prison for shooting this guy.
 That is another story and I will only say he deserved worse.

I had allotted a month or two to get this done. Been at it 4, I think.

 I built the case from an old single relief and full-flowed and hand fitted
every part and on and on. 

 By the time I got done I regret I don't have a counter-weighted crank 
in there but it is a really nice bottom end package.

 I've got a set of new jugs ready to fit up and pistons.

 Then there is the heads.  

 Some may recall I had picked up a set of DP heads (used) from my
Flaps and was cunningly reworking them.

 After a week of on and off cleaning they were finally clean enough
to really look at. The heat test and both heads had cracks between 
the valve seats on all four chambers.

 So I whined here on the list and rounded up another set.

 Really Groadie (sp)  but I saw the shape and year (85) and started 
the process on them. Barnacles etc.

 Finally got to the hot water wash in the sink yesterday,(see exped.
dishwasher).

 The last head in the hot water and the last rinse and there it was.

 There is a crack between the seats on one chamber.

 I pondered while pounding my own head on the wall for a while, then
took two vallium and went to bed.

 There are no uncracked heads in the state. Well, one .

 This morning I polished the new .410 shot-gun and thought of ski-masks and
card-board.

 I'm getting to old to go mug some kid for his heads as he comes 
down the hi-way.
 
 With my luck he has no brakes anyway.

 So if you see some old guy in his cammy jammies with a sign saying
&quot;will work for DP Heads&quot; along the road, give me a wave.
