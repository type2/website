Another easy test for the general working of the aux air valve:  With the
engine stone cold in the morning, pull the hose leading to the aux air valve
from its attachment at the air intake elbow and blow into the hose; air
should pass easily into the air distribution box.  Replace the hose and
start the engine to let it warm up.  With the engine completely warmed up,
kill the engine and repeat the test; this time no air should pass into the
air distribution box.

&gt; &gt;Hi volks,a freind of mine has a 80 vanagon with a injected 2.0.after
&gt; &gt;running on the highway for about 20 min,the rpms stay really high.
&gt; &gt;any one know what would cause this? thanks in advance
&gt;
&gt; I'm not an L-jet FI guy, but on D-jet I'd suspect that the auxilary air
valve
&gt; was not closing.  I think these work the same on both systems.  After
about 5-
&gt; 10 minutes of driving it should have closed all the way so no air passes
&gt; through it.  You can test it by warming up the engine (until it starts
idling
&gt; high), pull the large hose that runs from it to the air filter and hold
your
&gt; thumb over it.  If it sucks your thumb and drops the idle then it is not
&gt; working.
