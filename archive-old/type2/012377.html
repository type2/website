&gt; i was recently browsing through the archives on the subject matter of the 
&gt; spare tire mount on the front of the bus.

&lt;snip&gt;

along these lines, there has been some talk a while ago of a *bumper*
mounted spare tire holder -- like a roo bar/brush-guard that a tire could
be mounted on.  Opinions on these?  Are they readily/cheaply available?
I suppose I could just look into making one too...

Basically, after experiences travelling around in the bush and blowing 2 tires 
in 5 km, I like to carry 2 spares and while I'm already contemplating a 
roof-rack, I'm concerned about putting too much weight on the roof of my '71
hardtop, both from the top-heavy and the rack-held-on-by-rain-gutters-and-straining-them
perspective.

Thoughts/opinions?

thnks,
