Subject: dwell angle: why such a broad range of values?

Fellow point-setters:
Why is VW so generous in specifying the dwell angle on their distributors 
(New points: 42-58 degreees), while other vehicles, also using the Bosch, 
have a tighter spec (BMW 1600: 60 + or - 1 degree). Has anyone got data on 
what exactly is the best dwell angle setting? I do find the BMW runs better 
when set to spec. Wouldn't the VW also do so, if we knew its optimal 
setting?
