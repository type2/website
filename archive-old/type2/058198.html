Subject: How do I get my wiprers on the screen

Now this isn't going to interest you lot in the USA driving on the wrong side of
the road much, but how do I get the right hand side (from inside the van) wiper
to touch the screen along its whole length ?

I replaced both wiper baldes recently and I get an untouched patch in the middle
of the wipre because I have bent the wiper so it gets to the edge of the screen
i.e. the very curved bit.

I'm sure my old wipers (now long gone) used to do this and it is infuriating as
the unwiped patch is almost infront of me while my passenger has a lovely clear
view. Any hints on sorting this out ?

I'ts a pity VW didn't change the wipers for RHD cars as they did for the bug !

TIA
