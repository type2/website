&gt; Since it's still Friday here for a few hours, I'd like to take this chance
&gt; to send out some holiday greetings to all members: A belated Happy Hanukkah
&gt; to any Jewish folk on the list, a right-on-time Blessed Solstice to all you
&gt; Pagans (yo! over here!), Merry Christmas to the majority, and Happy Kwanzaa
&gt; to our friends of African heritage.

same here, and of course the End of Ramadan for those of the Islamic
faith, and Happy New Year to everyone I forgot
&gt; 
&gt; That being said, on to the bus content.............
&gt; 
&gt; I am planning out some electrical *improvements* to my 74; mainly an
&gt; alternator-controlled relay for my fuel pumps and tank flow valve which will
&gt; include a manual bypass switch on the dash &quot;just in case&quot;. Where would be
&gt; the better location for the relays? Up front under the dash and run the
&gt; power leads back to the engine compartment? Or put the relays in a box in
&gt; the engine compartment and run the control leads up to the dash? I know what
&gt; I think, I'm just looking for other's ideas.

well I would take a hint from VW, they put their stuff behind the panel on
the right side of the engine compartment.  Might even dig up one of the
circular disks used on the FI buses and make a compartment in there for
you relays and such

&gt; Also, how much juice does that little blue wire from the alternator put out?
&gt; Enough to power a couple of relays and maybe an indicator light (other than
&gt; the one on the instrument panel)?

?????

&gt; 
&gt; Careful out there on the roads over the holidays!

yes sir, you be carefull out there, took a short drive today and saw two
fender benders and just up the street a 12 year old was killed in a hit
and run on her way to school.  woman who hit her tested .218 blood alchol
level
