Subject: More money == working engine

Well, thanks to all, my engine is now running smoothly and happily and has
power.  The culprits:  injectors.  Not bad enough to cause the engine to
stop working, but not good enough to give it enough gas.  I replaced them
all today and it purrs like a, well, like a volkswagen.  Also in there was a
loose and slightly dirty CHT.  The AFM checked out perfect, though.  I'm
guessing what I thought was a vacuum leak is actually normal operating sound
of air going through the plenum.  Now, one last question:  having run it for
about 30 miles with bad injectors, have I seriously harmed the engine?  It
was obviously lean for that time.
It's so hard now to resist the urge to just lean on the pedal though, she
works so much better!

Thanks again,
Niall

Still on schedule to depart tomorrow :-)
