&lt;&lt; My wife dares all of you to call a local FLAPS and ask for a 'GEOTHERMAL
 &gt; PLUNKITY VALVE' and see what happens. I estimate 8 minutes or more to
 &gt; realize there isn't such a part with a 1 in 7 chance that they will simply
 &gt; tell you they don't carry those and refer you to the dealer.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Thanks for the bandwidth, just needed to vent a little hot air.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Take care all! &gt;&gt;
Sad but somewhat true, but I'm one of the very lucky few!  Not only is my
parts guy a very good friend, but he also happens to be an ex-factory VW
mechanic.  His wife is pretty darn good too!  These folks have save my bacon
and my VW's once than once.  And seeing how spring is just around the corner,
okay two corners.  The wonderful folks at Springfield German Imports just
happen to have a show every Father's day.  So if you happen to be around
Springfield Oregon, stop on by!  Show-Swap-and just plain good company!
   Peace, Love, and thinking warm thoughts!
