Subject: Problems getting warm engine to fire
Message-ID: &lt;37515762.AF862B4D_at_fullcomp_dot_com.au&gt;

I've trolled the archives but its nearly all about starter solenid
relays etc and that isn't my problem.

When I crank my cold engine it fires up straight away but if I try
starting it after it's warmed up I have to crank it over and over with
my foot to the floor.  Eventually it coughs and splutters to life and
spits out a bit of darkish stuff out the exhaust which I guess is fuel.
I suspecting flooding but I've recently installed a fuel shutoff
solenoid that shuts off the supply when you turn off the ignition.

Someone mentioned Muirs advising full throttle for warm starts but I've
had this bus for 3 years now and its never been this bad.  Set the
timing not so long ago so I'd be surprised if that was it but I'll look
at anything again if need be.

Want to take the bus for a 900km round trip in 3 days and don't want to
run into trouble with the starter motor or the battery going flat from
the crarnking while I'm away.

Any ideas what the problem might be?
