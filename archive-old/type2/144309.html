Subject: Dist driveshaft installation challenge

---------------------------------

I was just getting to the fun part w my new 1600 DP Mexican longblock. Everything clean and painted. 
But Im stumped on the dist driveshaft installation. 
Ive verified #1 TDC 6-8 times. 
Slot will not line up as shown in Muir/Bentley. 
Instead of the 3 oclock-9 oclock orientation when viewed from the back, all I can get is 2-8 or 4-10, each of these being about 15* off. Thats about 30* off on the pulley. 
Nothing in Muir/Bentley to suggest that it may not be spot on. 
Its not that Im skipping/not finding the right groove, I look down the fuel pump hole and can see that the 2-8 and 4-10 views come from adjacent splines. 
I tried #3TDC w the shaft slot 180* off, same deal 2-8 or 4-10, no 3-9. 
Nothing in Muir/Bentley to suggest that it may not be spot on. 
Sostumped.any suggestions please?????????? 
Id prefer to get it right, but its got me wondering if 2-8 or 4-10 are OK, that when timing the dist, the range of adjustment will allow all to work out OK. 
If so, is one better than the other (2-8 or 4-10)? 
Any suggestions GREATLY appreciated. 
Thanks

Denny
