&gt; &gt;Did any VW Things ever come out with automatic tranmissions like what are 
&gt; &gt;found in Bugs and Ghias?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;         No, say I.  My '74 thing is still in the hands of it's original
&gt; owner, ME!(yes, for thouse of you who have met me.  There is a long story in
&gt; this)  I have a auto trend (I think that is the name of the magazine)review
&gt; of the thing and the owners manual and there is no mention of an automatic.
&gt; 
&gt;         The thing had a thing spicific transmission.  Mine now has a
&gt; standard bug transmission as the thing transmission only lasted about four
&gt; years (the original tranney is still lying around just in case I ever feel
&gt; like tinkering on it).

&gt;       and the world will follow
&gt;       our lead into the future!&quot;
