Subject: Homebrew tow bar success pix

Hey everyone! Well, my Dad and I went for and built me a homemade bus tow bar.
And it had its maiden voyage this morning when I used it to tow home my new 72
Deluxe that I just bought. Since I have my driver 71 Westy, I'm not sure
exactly what I plan to do with the 72 yet, but I will definitely do one of two
things, either 1)Get the engine to run and sell it cheap. OR since I have
always wanted a beater bus to do up hippy style, I may 2)Have everyone help me
put on a cool hippy paint job and do the whole thing up in psychodelic groovy
deadhead style, right down to the beaded curtains and lava lamps! What do you
think, wouldn't that be a fun activity at this Spring's VW Buses 'n Boats
show!!
Here is a link to the pix:

If anyone is interested in details or better pix of the tow itself, let me
know and I'll get em to you!

Peace, John Baker

headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
