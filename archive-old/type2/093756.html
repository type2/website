perfect timing on that link.. went right back to westfalia_dot_org and posted
http://www.vwbusparts.freeserve.co_dot_uk/vwbus/1962.html
link up to a message line there.  Evidently a couple of these trailers 
have turned up and nobody has much info on them.  From descriptions it 
seems they were designed to be towed behind buses of that era.
also found this on the same site for those with version questions
