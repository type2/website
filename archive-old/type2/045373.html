Subject: Re: [T2] need tach with alarm (girlfriend abuse)

Hey Ben,
I believe that there is a solution to this problem (that is bus
related!).  I remember a while ago, there was a person on the list that
was having a problem with their bus not allowing the rpms to go over
3000 rpms.  Finally, he realized that it was the rev limiter in his
tach.  I don't know what model had this, but that's probably what you
want.  Even though it's not an alarm, she'll probably notice when the
car starts caughing and sputtering :)

Does anyone know how this thing would hookup and limit revs?  Is this
VDO?  I'm actually interested now.. hehehe

later,
Mike

&gt; hi all. here's a problem i'm sure many of you have
&gt; encountered: my girlfriend and i bought a '77 westy
&gt; together. it runs well, but i'm afraid it won't run well
&gt; for long the way she drives it. no matter how many times i
&gt; scold her for overrevving the motor, she simply cannot pay
&gt; attention to the rpms. she frequently pushes 60 in third
&gt; gear. i can keep a watch on her when we're both in the car,
&gt; but who knows what evils she perpetrates on our poor bus
&gt; when i'm not around. the only solution i can think of is to
&gt; install a tach that sounds an alarm when the rpms get above
&gt; a certain level. i think an annoying screech every time the
&gt; motor is overrevving would probably cure her bad driving
&gt; habits. has anybody heard of such a device? if not, do you
&gt; have any other technical solutions? forget about trying to
&gt; get her to drive better - it won't happen.
&gt; 
&gt; peace,
&gt; ben
