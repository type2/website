Subject: Re: Sink cabinet

The water tank has a drain pipe going thru the floor that seems to make it
difficult to pull the tank relative to clearing the vent pipe.- I think
they glue the drain in after cabinet is in  place!
Pull out the shelves (Flip them up) and the pipe cover in the corner behind
the shelves.  Cut the pipe with enough room to put in a coupling piece
later.   Now the tank will easily pull out away from the vent.
