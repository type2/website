&gt; That would rock for puttering around town! Zero gas! WooHoo!
&gt;
&gt; I put my name on the list too. The auto and oil lobbies will probably keep
&gt; it from the US though. :(

The laws of physics might have something to say about it too.

According to the articles on the website (if my Spanish is correct) The
air tank holds 90m^3 of air at 300atm.  That's 4500PSI!

Large welding &quot;T&quot; tanks hold 9.35m^3 at 2600PSI and are 55 inches long and
9 inches in diameter.  Even at twice the pressure, you would still have to
squeeze five of these into that little car!  If you use just one large
tank it just about has to be sphere to take the pressure.

I wonder if I could drop that engine into a bus?  Aircooled?  Nope, Air
powered!
