&gt;Just so I know the readings I get make sense.... I checked the triple

What is the heritage of your meter?? What reading is shown just holding the 
probes in contact??

&gt;  This tells me those
&gt;wires are fine. Right?

If you can add to that, the terminals do not show a dark age patina and 
they grip firmly and there is no evidence of insulation melting or 
darkening and no corrosion at all then, yes, that part of the inspection is 
complete. If you don't state you have verified these things should I always 
assume you did or didn't. Get detailed and specific about these many 
mundane steps in a complete inspection procedure.

&gt;Then, I put one sensor on the plug that has the

The easy way to resolve this issue with the bulb circuit is to replace the 
old bulb to rule out resistance in the filament. I mentioned this before. 
The contacts in the bulb holder could be foul and just a wiggle might prove 
the culprit. Did you do this?? You can remove the bulb and test the ohms 
through it and compare to a new bulb and perhaps CONFIRM THE CULPRIT or at 
least rule out a very easy thing that is quick and easy to do, and is known 
to cause poor charging. That is why it was offered as one of the FIRST 
steps to charging system issues. With the bulb out, then you can confirm 
the blue wire ohms, then turn on the key and confirm battery voltage for 
the bulb feed.

&gt;I was thinking of trying this:
&gt;  Does this make sense, or
&gt;am I describing a great way to fry more electricals?

Whatever you said I'm not sure of. Stick to the book or open the door to 
risk of lost time/money.

&gt;BTW, I found a local FLAP (Discount Import Parts) that has a Bosch ALT
&gt;for $84 (with core dep). I'll be acquiring and installing this weekend,
&gt;assuming I don't find a bad wire.

&gt;As I was into the engine bay up to my
&gt;waist Monday night, I noticed that the engine door seal was gone and
&gt;water near the battery tray lip. I think I found the source of the
&gt;failure: no seal -&gt; rainwater access to inside of engine compartment -&gt;
&gt;water access to ALT -&gt; GEN light on.

If water at a connection caused a short, you would expect to see some 
staining from the evaporated water along with evidence of corrosion or 
excess heat. Of course fix the seal but very low probability it had 
anything to do with your issues unless there is further evidence as above 
described.
