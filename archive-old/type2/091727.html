Subject: Re: [T2] fuel filter / pressure regulator placement

It isnt the weight so much as the combination of a weight and heavy 
vibration and push in fittings.  I have seen pull outs on generators 
that had been maintained and someone neglected to clamp the filters back 
down. fortunately no fires, just some individuals having severe heart 
attacks and spraying everything down.

&gt; There isn't a reason you cant do it, as a matter of fact a good number
&gt; of people have placed them in the engine compartment. The one thing I
&gt; would avoid doing is placing the filter on the lines that go to the
&gt; carbs, place it before the pump. This helps remove the strain on the
&gt; carb fittings, causing less chance of them pulling out. Granted, I
&gt; personally think a filter would not add enough weight to do so, but I
&gt; would rather be safe than roasted, and im sure the bus feels the same
&gt; way.
