Subject: fuel tank vent line hose question

I just filled my gas tank really full and notice some gas in the engine 
compartment on the driver's side.  I took a look at the vent lines and 
spotted a piece of old fuel tubing that comes from the fuel tank vent 
lines so I'm going to change that.  Is there a piece of tubing on the 
other (passenger) side?  I couldn't see anything there (looking from the 
top, or bottom) so I just wanted to double check with all of you that 
there's only vent line hose, inside the engine compartment, on the 
driver's side and not the passenger side that connects to the metal vent 
lines.

I have already changed all of the hoses in front of the firewall, 
changed the big fat filler tube, and will change the elbow when I put 
the new engine in.  All under-tank hose has been changed and when the 
engine gets put in, it'll have a totally new fuel rail.  Vent lines to 
the charcoal filter have fresh hose, too.  I want to make sure that 
every single hose is replaced, so if I missed a hidden hose somewhere, 
please let me know!

btw, it's a 78 westy...

Mike
