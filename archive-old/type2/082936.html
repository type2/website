Subject: my bus is a dog???

hello all,

so my mechanic told me that my westy is a dog, even
for a bus. at first i thought it was just because the
clutch was slipping, i had that replaced, and it still
seems slower than it should be. the mechanic suggested
that at some point someone may have rebuilt the engine
and installed the crankshaft 180 degrees the wrong
way. does this make sense to anybody out there? any
insights on this issue( ie. the crankshaft theory, how
&quot;fast&quot; a 76 camper should be, or what else might be
causing my deficency) would be greatly appreciated. as
always, thank you in advance!!!
