&gt;I am building a new 1641cc for my Kewl retro-Kustom Kombi project and 
&gt;have been thinking of running Castrol Syntec or some other synthetic oil.

I was using the semi-synthetic castrol (durablend) and once the weather
started warming up, I started getting a flickering oil light.  I switched
back to 20/50, and the problem went away.  I think they just don't make
thick enuf synthetics for air-cooleds in the summer...
