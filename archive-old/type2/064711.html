Subject: Diameter needed for FI gas lines

hey now,

does anyone know that stock sizes of the all the gas lines on a '77 FI Westy?
i need to replace mine and went to the local VWFlaps but they wanted to know
what sizes i needed. i'd like to know in advance so i can take one section of
hose off at a time instead of taking all off. and the guy at the VWFlaps had
no idea what size i would need. and is 35psi or 40psi okay for fuel injection?

thanks,

jonathan
