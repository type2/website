Brad,

Where exactly did you install the temp sender? At the sparkplug? That's
where I had mine and the reading was very stable, 350F give or take 10F
under all conditions, load, no load, summer or mild winter. That was a sign
to me that the thermostat was working as it should.

Later, I moved the sender to different locations on the head and never had
stable readings. My conclusion is that you don't want the sender to be
exposed to the airflow, that's why the sparkplug hole recess is such a
perfect location, even though it is not very convenient.

So my point is that there are 2 things to look at: (1) reliable measurement
and (2) properly working thermostat and cooling flaps.

Sami
