Subject: Re: [T2] oil filters and oil

20/50 might be the way to go, but I've run 40wt for years in the 2 liter
with no ill effects.  In the very hot triple digit weather of Northern Cal
in August/September I even ran 50wt in my 80 Vanagon.

I've used Wix filters for over two decades now.  These are an excellent
quality-made product.  When I can't find Mahle or Mann, I use the Wix
everytime.  I currently use Wix on my 84 Wasserleaker, no oil pressure
problems to speak of.  Do not use Fram! Ever!
YMMV

&gt; I've been told by numerous sources just to use 20-50 Castrol
&gt; year  round.  That's what Bentley recommends also, IIRC.  And I  would say
&gt; that the Wix filter is a definite no no.  They may give  you a tad more
&gt; power (not really even the right term) but you're going  to be sucking a lot
&gt; more crap through the engine because they rate low  in terms of
&gt; filtering.  Richard's site might have the comparison  chart that went out
&gt; recently.  I think it came from Karl.
