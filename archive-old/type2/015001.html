Hey, I'm the guy who owes David $9.50. I put a check in the mail tonight
for that plus some for his trouble. I'm not trying to rip him off; I've
just been slack and when I talked to David a week ago via e-mail, he wasn't
at all upset or worried. Really busy times, but those aren't good excuses.
All I can say is &quot;sorry.&quot;

I am known to the list and its members. I'm not ripping anyone off and I
hope my slow repayment to David (which I honestly thought he wasn't
concerned about) won't cause anyone to distrust any other list member. I
think most of us are honest.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;I wouldn't call it karma... that's just a rip off from the old biblical
&gt;maxim... &quot;what you sow, is what you reap&quot;... I tend to be generous as well,
&gt;and most people I deal with are generous with me...in spite of what their
&gt;original intentions were! So please don't lose your faith in human nature...
