Subject: Re: [T2] Battery light woes

Couple things Troy didn't mention...

His bus is the one the old battery switched polarity on. Most likely caused
by flat battery plus hot jumper cables from other car. He bought a new
battery after that.

He also swapped out the alternator for a known good one (the one I was
borrowing from him for my 73), and swapped regulators with his other bus.
The regulator was unknown, but having the exact same thing happening is
unlikely.

The only thing I can think of is a short or something ungrounded.
