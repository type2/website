Hi,

I just had an alignment done on my '79 Camper at NTB. Though I gave them the Bentley for the specs, they used their computer's Vanagon settings (80-92).
Are the specs close enough or should I insist on having it redone according to Bentley specs?
It does not pull or anything but it does not feel totally right, either.
BTW, the alignment was done after a complete front end overhaul (new beam, balljoint, steering pin, and tie rod ends).
