&gt; scale is Methyl Ethyl Ketone, MEK as it's know.  It's very strong
&gt; and can be 
&gt; had at better hardware and paint stores.  The fumes are terrible,
&gt; and you'd 
&gt; better be working with protective gloves on.  Read the safety
&gt; warnings on 
&gt; the can and believe them!  On the upside, the stuff will soften
&gt; that old 
&gt; glue pretty quick and you may be able to wipe it off with a rag. 
&gt; But before 
&gt; long it will soften the paint too so be careful.

YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE IT!!!!!

I ignored the warnings and paid dearly for it!

I used MEK to strip Duct Tape glue off of an aluminum window frame
that had been covered with plastic after the window was busted out. 
I didn't bother with gloves and as a result I ended up with chemical
burns that took over 6 YEARS to heal and has permanently removed all
the melanin in my fingers.  In other words, my fingers no longer tan,
they just burn when exposed to too much sunlight...  During the
healing process, my skin remained so hard and dry, that the simple
act of closing my fist caused all of my knuckles to split and
bleed...

A lesson I learned the hard way and shall not soon forget!
