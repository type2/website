Subject: Re: [T2] Metric or NPT was VDO oil Pressuse adapter question

&gt; OK, i am done with this thread.   :)

I am not ... The dual senders are available with both threads - NPT and
10mm. So that still leaves the 10mm vs. NPT question open. After all, VDO
wants to sell these gauges to big block V8 drivers as well.

As soon as I have my hose kit from Collie, I will measure the stock sender,
and the dual sender to provide some reliable information - I know that my
sender came off a VW engine. With NPT and 10x1.0 being so similar to each
other, no one on the list has provided a satisfying answer to this puzzle
yet other than that grease gun hose is close enough to not result in instant
damage.
