Subject: Electric conversion -- resources?

Any volts-wagen enthusiasts??  I've got a pretty nice 1969 Bay that would be 
used mostly for short commutes, maybe 7 or 8 easy miles each way.  Saw some 
surplus 10 hp DC motors, very reasonably priced, and thought with fifteen 12 V 
car batteries, which would fit easily in the cargo area, I might have a plan... 
except of course for the CONTROL SYSTEM.  I'm going to work out some rough 
numbers to see if this makes sense.... meantime would like to hear from anyone 
who could point me to articles, references, sources, etc.

Thanks, and have a great day!
  Glenn in Spartanburg, SC
