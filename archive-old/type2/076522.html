&gt; The other one I had, notably from the same neighbor, is that &quot;the wire

&gt; throw it away when you take off the valve covers.&quot;

Ummm....  not true! The wire is there because not having it there risks
the pushrod tube popping out of the case. While the odds of a pushrod tube
falling out are low, the result would be catastrophic.  I don't imagine it
would take more than a couple seconds to pump all the oil out of an engine
thru a pushrod port, even by splash alone. With the oil gone, you have a
second or two to shut it down before you need a rebuild.

My take on this is that VW made a bet with every single screw/nut/
bolt/wire they installed.  They were betting that the cost of installing
it was less than the cost of repairing the damage under warrantee.  And
rememeber that the cost of a screw (installed) over the whole of the
production run was probably in the $50,000 range! If you see 3 shroud
screws in a certain piece of tin, there are three because two would not
do.  Engineers and accountants are in constant battle in every
manufacuring shop, worldwide.

&gt; Uh, i have seen a number of busses without this wire, probably because it is
&gt; a pain to get in right, but are folks without this wire headed towards some
&gt; kind of disaster?

Yes, as described above.  Getting back to the $50,000 cost of
installation, distributed over 25K buses/year, they were discussing
whether more than 25 tubes would pop out,  with engine replacement costing
~$2,000/engine, so the expected failure rate may have been as low as .1%,
but if it's *your* engine, well, that's a different story, ain't it?

&gt; Okay, also, if anyone else has VW oldwive's tales, lets discuss 'em...

Oh, my, there are so many!  My personal favorite is, &quot;If you drive a T4
engine bus and your gen light comes on, you can keep going because the fan
is bolted to the end of the crank.&quot; This one, too, is absolutley FALSE!
We have had half a dozen cases (one recently) on this list where the fan
hub or bolts sheared off and the fan stopped turning (and cooling the
engine).
