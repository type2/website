Subject: oil additive advice

Hi all.

I was doing some research in the archives about oil additives and some 
people think it makes no difference but some people sware by it.  So I 
figgure for twenty or thirty bucks what the heck why not?  So I was doing 
some more research and low and behold both Zmax and Duralube are supposed to 
be corrosive to your bearings.  Well I am wondering if anybody has run 
either stuff for an extended perriod of time and could tell me just exactly 
how corrosive it really is.  I was told that the active ingreedient is 
LinKite and I was wondering if anybody knew of a product that contained 
LinKite but wasn't corrosive.  I am starting to think that the best thing 
would be to stick with normal oil and change it regularly, so if that is 
what you want to tell me than you can save the space in the archive and 
pmail me about it.  But if anybody has had any experience with running the 
stuff for a long perriod of time, and knows for sure how much dammage it 
could prevent or create please let me know. TIA
