well after getting the runaround for the last hour on eht phone(not to mention
a week)....i am  mad...they (the company who makes battery isolater's and my
RV' shop) has decided that i am not able to put a battery isolater in my '72
bus.......i guess since the regulater is on the firewall, it just wont
work........i said hum.......there is other people from this list who have
done this, and im sure it is possible, he gave me a bunch of mumble jumble
that even I couldnt understand, (which is rare) so i think im just gonna
either parellel 2 battery's together, or justbuy one and rig it up .........
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME IF THEY ARE GIVING ME $HIT , OR IS IT IMPOSSIBLE?

Thanks all in advance,
Adam
