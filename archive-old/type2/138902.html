&gt; OK, so the compressor is seized-up now.  How do you know it was not free to
&gt; rotate, clutch engaged, when the Tappet Brothers offered their diagnosis?  In
&gt; 1984 R-12 was freely available.  They could have offered to put some dye in
&gt; the 
&gt; system... OTOH, possibly they looked at the complexity of the installation and
&gt; set a profitability threshold.

I can only guess. The a/c cost was over $500 (1971 Dollars)...

&gt; (a) learning about A/C systems and the conversion to R-134a, or (b) paying
&gt; someone reputable to undertake this for you.  In either case, you might look
&gt; around (maybe on eBay) for a good R-134a compressor.  They do show up.  Lots
&gt; of 
&gt; time until the temperatures climb -- summer 2005 ;-))

Luckily this isn't my bus to have to worry about making a decision.
