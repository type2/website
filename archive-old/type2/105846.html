&gt;BUT, and that's a BIG &quot;but&quot;, I won't be able to use the VW logo (for reasons

Who'd want that anyway?  The logo of the huge corporation that sues
a woman for making hand painted mugs with a splittie (with a nose emblem)
on it.

&gt;Several ideas for replacing the logo:
&gt;   1. A &quot;V&quot; in a circle on the left flap, and a &quot;W&quot; in a circle on the left
&gt;(My favorite, and I think that it's legal to use).
&gt;   2. Left: &quot;Bus&quot;, right: &quot;Freak&quot;

How about something a bit more topical?
like Left: &quot;Back&quot;, right: &quot;Off&quot;
