Subject: Question about gas-a-just shocks !!

the only stupid question is the one not asked !!

with that said:

I have kyb gas-a-just shocks on my 70 bus, my stance
in the front appears a little high. Can I take these
shocks off and adjust them down? Therefore lowering
the front stance a tad..

peace,
