Subject: Re: [T2]Less expensive cd player?

jason i have two 10's placed right when you start to go down in between the seat wlak through in a box.
just have to duck a little to walk through there... have them mounted up there witha iron pipe..
also to make this possible i have a penthouse top which is pretty high so might not work for everyones bus.. 
good luck bro..
i also have the door speakers in the doors panels... and two tweeters mounted underneath the dash... she sounds good and has bass but enough to give it a live affect and not loud and rapped out  not like a pimp my ride kinda thing but a in stereo deal .. i like to listen to it clear and with the right affects... you can hear it outside the bus if i am parked ... also have a remote to stereo so that when i am camping i can turn the station laying in the bed...
suggested by buddah so i have to have it and love it..
we keep the radio on low while sleeping.. 
peace and love
chris

Since we're on the subject of tunes in da Bus...

I have been pondering how to get some decent speakers in the Westy 
without totally butchering the interior. Sadly, the PO put some (only 
half-decent) speakers in the door panels (probably the worst place for 
them in terms of sound quality, exposure to water, and the fact that 
your toes catch the grilles getting in to and out of the Bus).

The real problem is where to place speakers with decent bass response. 
There is not much room for a good set of 6x9's unless you want to cut 
holes in cabinets or remove cabinets, neither of which I don't want to 
do.

I think I have found the solution.

The Bazooka bass tube. There is a small 6&quot; version. It is totally 
self-contained, including amplifier and low-pass filter, and can easily 
mount to the back of the folding bed. It straps on and uses a molex 
plug for its wiring harness, so can quickly be removed when you want to 
fold the seat down. Could easily be placed in the rear cargo area of a 
non-Westy. Battery in the Bus is conveniently located for providing 
power to the built-in amp.

This would allow use of smaller speakers all around, since you don't 
need to coerce bass response out of them... some 5&quot; 2-ways with 
high-pass filters mounted in the rear panel on the cargo hatch, 4&quot; 
mid-range mounted in the kick panels, tweeters stuck down in the 
corners of the dash to round it out.
