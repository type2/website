Subject: Clutchdisk,Jackand Stands, needed for engine swap in bay area

Greetings,

I'm planning to put a rebuild into my '72 westy...i
found one which had the heads redone 3 yrs back and
has sat in storage since, without ever running past
the garage...the shop is reputable.

I'm apartment hopping in san francisco and trying to
keep the project low budget.  I'd like to throw in a
decent clutch disk while i'm at it. the current one
has about 20,000 miles on it,and probably had rear
seal oil leakage. Considering a partially &quot;used&quot; one.I
don't recall the size of the clutch just now.

Any help will be appreciated.  
Thanks,
Shawn
