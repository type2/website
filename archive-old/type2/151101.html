Subject: Re: [T2] Electric winch for pulling T2's

Troy,

I would think that a 6,000 lb winch would do it.

If it is rated at 6,000 then presumably the cable is good for a straight 
lift up at 6,000 before it snaps.

the rolling resistance of the bus should be no where near 6,000lbs...even 
going up an incline.

The only bad part will be if the brakes are locked up from sitting too 
long...and other anti rolling problems.

**************************************************************************
Re-read the winch specs....does it say rolling weight of 6,000 or straight 
up weight of 6,000????

*That* is the real question!

****************************************************************************

Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; 	We've picked up an enclosed car hauler that is tall enough for T2's

&amp;gt; in most cases, I am having an electric winch installed in the front of it.
&amp;gt; My question is, do I need a 6000# winch to pull a bus onto a car hauler or
&amp;gt; can I go with something smaller?  The ramp is 6' long and the slope of the
&amp;gt; ramp is not bad at all.  I'm just wondering if I can go with something
&amp;gt; smaller since I'm not trying to lift a bus completely off the ground, but
&amp;gt; just pull it on the trailer rather.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Thanks for the input.
