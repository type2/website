Today checked the valve settings. All but three were .006. The others were
.008
Thats good! ?
Compression was 105 110 105 110
Sounds good.
All plugs but #1 looked &quot;black&quot; .

Any input?

Subject: Everybus/ What did I do to the engine?


&gt; Just as I pulled into Everybus, I noted that there was a little more smoke
&gt; that normal, but have a leaky oil cooler, so was not concerned. Spent the
&gt; weekend socializing and losing the chili cookoff, and losing the best
&gt; campsite prize. :-)
&gt;
&gt; Topped off the oil, lost about ¼ quart on the trip down. Sunday as I
pulled
&gt; out all started ok, no worries.
&gt;
&gt; Got gas at about 10 miles and had a little start problem. Humm???
&gt;
&gt; 30 more miles and started noticing a loss of power. Looked at the trees.
Not
&gt; that much head wind. Then &quot;the smell&quot; hit me. Hot and pulled over. Ouch,
&gt; VERY VERY HOT. Dumping a fair amount of oil.
&gt;
&gt; After cooling down made an unscheduled trip to Farmington for an engine. I
&gt; found a turnkey that sounded nice but I did not have the bread and he
would
&gt; not take a credit card or check.
&gt;
&gt; I made it back by going slow with frequent rests and a very long stop
before
&gt; heading up the mountain into 20 degree cooler weather. The nice folks from
&gt; Good Ole Volks caught my back door in the event of a complete failure; I
&gt; would have been able to get home with them. You have to give a lot of
credit
&gt; to guys that will stick with you that long.
&gt;
&gt; My question: What did I do to this engine? Got really hot. Jamie shot his
&gt; thermometer at it and was 240 on the case and 350 on the heads, but that
was
&gt; after cooling down and 10 miles of flatland going 40 to 45mph. My plan is
to
&gt; check the valve clearances, then compression, then jank it to put Urge's
(71
&gt; bus) engine in. What would you do?
&gt;
&gt; After cooling down, I estimate the engine was running on about 75% of
normal
&gt; power. Hills I take at 38 in third were struggling at 30 or going to
second
&gt; gear.
