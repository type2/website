Subject: Distributor for electronic ignition

Hello!

I know very little about this... are there different distributors for
electronic ignition and for points?

Specifically, will the SVDA distributor at CB Performance (
http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=1348) work with a 1983
Vanagon?

Bus Depot lists the same distributor for a range of buses ranging from 1950
to 1983... but the shop my bus is at tells me that the distributor I bought
is for points, not electronic ignition.

Would somebody mind educating me a bit?

Thanks!
Mike.
