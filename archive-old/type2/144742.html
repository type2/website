&gt; Hello Dan  Be careful using these  I just had a BMW come in the shop that had 
&gt; the remains of one of these hanging by not much,  some quick oil change place 
&gt; put it in there  funny thing was there wasnt anything wrong with the threads  
&gt; I replaced it with a bolt and sealing washer   I am not too sure that that 
&gt; rubber will hold up too long soaking in oil . Personally I would just fix it 
&gt; right and be done but then I do this stuff for a living and own my own shop Later 

In the end I had to go with what was easy for me.  I've got the rubber
plug in, and it isn't leaking at all.  Tomorrow morning on my way in I'm
dropping her off at the shop for the timesert fix.  That is as close to
fixing it right as I can get for now.  So as long as it holds lasts
another 13 hours and 5 miles she should be golden.

Thanks for all the help.
