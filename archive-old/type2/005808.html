Hi Karen,

    Sounds like the needle valve for the leaking carb. has some trash in it.
It works like a toilet bowl, if the valve doesn't stop the gas flow, it will
keep running until the tank empties, just like a toilet that keeps running.
In your case the gas has ran into the cylinders and &quot;hydrolytic&quot; the engine
(locked up) because the liquid gas wont compress. Don't keep trying to turn
it over, or you may do major damage!
    You need to do several things, pull the plugs and let the gas evaporate
from the cylinders, change the oil, find out what is causing the valve not
to close.
    Sometimes people pull the plugs and spin the engine over until all the
gas is pushed out. You can do this but you must disconnect the #15 lead (hot
wire) to the ign coil first, or you may start a fire.
    Not to insult your technical abilities, but this should be done by
someone with a fare amount of experience, most of all the carb part. Now
everyone is going to think I want to &quot;keep the little woman in the kitchen&quot;.
Please don't send me hate mail! :-) :-)
    Good luck!
