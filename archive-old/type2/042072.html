Subject: old tires

Some time back there was a post asking about the advisability of running on old
tires. My wife just bought a 1993 Eurovan and while reading through the owner's
manual came across this warning from VW, &quot;Tires age even if they are not being
used. Tires which are older than 6 years old should only be used in an emergency
and then with caution.&quot;
