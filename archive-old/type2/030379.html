Thanks Paul for the great description of the bus heater system.  I had 
been wondering how the system worked since I bought my bus, but never 
figured it out until now.

But one thing still puzzles me.  My heater control boxes are the 2-way 
type with one inlet and two outlets.  Do you know what I mean?  One 
outlet goes to the front of the bus for cab heat and the other oulet 
goes to short pipes which look like tailpipes.  When the heat control 
box is &quot;off&quot;, the heated air goes out these fake tailpipes.  But it 
seems like this would rob cooling air from your engine, much like if you 
were missing the heat control boxes altogether.

Does anyone know the answer to this?

Thanks
