Subject: RE: [T2] customer service by Bus Depot - a long posting

&gt; In August I ordered a set of floor mats for my bus - approx. $150.  The
&gt; first order got lost by the post office.  The Bus Depot said no biggie,
&gt; we'll send you a replacement.  Get the replacement and a week later
&gt;
&gt; In October I get the first shipment of floor mats.   I like to think I'm
an
&gt; honest guy so I figure I be nice and call the Bus Depot and ask them
&gt; what they want done.  Figure they'll be happy.  I mean I could of sold
&gt;  them to somebody for $75
&gt;
&gt; I got a big surprise.  See the email below. I mean what's with these guys?
&gt; So I responded with the following.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;The shipping on this is $45.  That's a tad bit more than I want to lay
&gt; out on the premise that I might get it back if the Post Office decides
&gt; to pay the Bus Depot back.  I will gladly ship it via COD.  I will not
&gt; bill you for my time to bring it to the Post Office and wait in line.
&gt;
&gt; I was a nice, and honest, guy by telling you that I got the package.
&gt; I could of said nothing.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I wait and finally get a call from &quot;Dave&quot; who tells me sorry and
&gt; send the package and The Bus Depot will reimburse me as soon as I
&gt; send the package.  Silly me - I believed him.  I sent the package
&gt; and called the Bus Depot with the cost of the postage.
&gt; I'm still waiting for my reimbursement.
&gt;
&gt; I saw the posting on how the Bus Depot just got a big shipment in
&gt; and how they're really busy - don't call.  Believe me it'll be a while
&gt; before I call again.



Bradley,

As you know from the email I sent to the list last week (which you
referenced), I was out of town until today. What a surprise to return home
and discover that you have flamed me on the List in my absence, knowing that
I wasn't even here to read or reply to it.   Seems a bit of a cheap shot,
don't you think?

Just to set the situation straight here, I sent you a carpet mat set to
Hawaii, via Mail because it was the only affordable shipping method.  (Had
you been in the continental U.S. we'd have shipped UPS.)  It was
lost/delayed in the mail, so I sent you a second set for FREE.  PLUS I
upgraded your shipping to Priority so you'd get them fast, and didn't charge
you for that either. This cost about $200 out of my pocket.  All I asked in
return was that you sign the mail insurance claim form, and return the first
set if/when it arrived.

Jump forward a couple of months. The original set finally shows up in the
mail.  You let us know it turned up, but only after pointing out (several
times now!) that you could have stolen it, by concealing the fact that it
had arrived and keeping or selling it.  Instead you offer to return it,
C.O.D. for $45 postage.  Because you are such a nice guy, you will not bill
me for your time in dropping it off at the post office!!  You actually think
you deserve a &quot;labor charge&quot; for taking the slightest effort to do the
honest thing!  This after I already sent you a second set of mats with
upgraded shipping, paying $200 out of my own pocket.  Incredible!

I do appreciate your honesty.  But I don't think you deserve the huge pat on
the back that you apparantly think you do, simply for choosing not to commit
insurance fraud.  Honest people &quot;choose&quot; not to steal every day, even when
presented with an easy opportunity.  Remember, I trusted you in the first
place, sending you a second set of mats gratis, on nothing but your word
that you'd send back the first set if/when it turned up.  So you did what
you promised to do.  Good.  Why should I have expected anything less?

The only point on which we agree is that Cheri's email asking you to send
the second set back within 30 days was a bit curt in its wording, and for
this I apologize.  In fact I noticed that myself right after she sent it.
(All email sent from the Depot is cc'd to me, and I spot-check it for
accuracy; this happened to be one I checked.)

That is why I had my manager Dan (not Dave) call you personally immediately
afterward, and also offer to reimburse your return shipping cost, as you had
demanded.  (Many customers would have even volunteered to split this cost,
knowing that I had paid the outbound shipping cost twice already for a
situation that wasn't either of our faults.)  He promised you an immediate
reimbursement for shipping cost, if you would send the mats back via insured
parcel post, and then either fax or email an actual copy of the postage and
insurance receipts.  Twice since then, first Dan and then Cheri have
reminded you that the ball was in your court - that we were simply awaiting
your receipt for reimbursement.  But you did not send it despite these
numerous requests.

Just to show that we still trust you, we have now refunded your return
postage cost anyway, based on the amount that you stated, even though you
still have not faxed us the receipts.  But I do need them.  I presume that
you will fax it or email a scan of them by the weekend.  Perhaps you were
busy and just didn't have time to do it.  Our fax number is 215-234-0890,
and you have our email address.  Once you fax us these receipts, this
transaction is mercifully completed.

So I have now paid about $240 out of my pocket, between the cost of the
replacement mats and round-trip postage (which the post office will not
reimburse).  I have yet to receive back the original mats (which are
supposedly on their way back, based on your word).  I could have made this
the post office's problem (since it was their mistake), and asked you to
wait for the insurance claim to go through before replacing the missing
mats. I could have at least insisted on your signing and returning the the
US Mail claim form stating that the first set was missing, before sending a
replacement.  But I didn't.  Instead, I immediately assumed full
responsibility (and a large financial loss) for the post office's mistake,
and promptly sent you a new set of mats up front, even paying for postage
both ways.

How could anyone POSSIBLY expect better service than that!  When's the last
time YOU trusted a total stranger with $240 of YOUR money, and paid out over
$100 for someone else's mistake? You should be singing my praises to the
List, as a shining example of exemplary customer service!  Instead you have
the audacity to complain to 1000 people, behind my back while I'm out of
town.  Nice.  I guess some people are just never satisfied unless you bend
over backward so far that you break.

So if you say, &quot;believe me it'll be a while before I call again,&quot; to you I
say - good, make it so!  By all means, find someone else to send you bus
parts to Hawaii.  I don't need or want customers like you.  Shame on you!
