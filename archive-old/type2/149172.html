&gt;Unfortunately, the current Oregon governor is planning to veto the

&gt;as long as we all do it together&quot;. Apparently, there's some kind of
&gt;push to get the CA law into Washington as well. There goes the

I recently read that online:

My favorite quote:

&quot;The 2016 date was set to give automakers plenty of time to comply with the new standards&quot;.

A lobbyist couldn't have written that any better. Does it really take 10 years to be able to offer CA car model in 2 more states!
