Subject: RE: [T2] engine swap/assesment

My comments are below; some of this you probably already know...

	Look at ALL vacuum hoses, replace anything iffy.

	Maybe dissamble, clean, and grease the throttle body and intake manifold.

	Have injectors cleaned &amp; balanced.

&gt;Here is what I have so far but I know there are more things I should check.
&gt;
&gt;Before pull:
&gt;
&gt;Compression test

	Good Idea

&gt;While out:
&gt;
&gt;cluch inspect

	Grease/replace all the bushings too, replace the T/O bearing while it's
out.

&gt;install thermastat and flaps
&gt;Clean and paint tin

	My hi-temp paint didn't hold up too well; next time I'm going to powdercoat

&gt;Replace rear main seal? (I think this is what is leaking, up by the
flywheel/bell housing)

	replace both front &amp; rear seals; they're cheap.

&gt;replace pushrod tube seals (at least one is leaking)

	Use viton seals

&gt;New injector seals?

	Yes, get good ones, lube w/ silicone spray

&gt;Check end play.

	yup.

&gt;look for other oil leaks.

	yup.

&gt;replace pilot bushing? in bell housing for starter.

	ABSOLUTELY. Cheap insurance, they seem to fail all the time, then you have
to drop the engine for a $1.39 part  &gt;:0|

&gt;check the rubber engine mounts

	They're cheap &amp; easy too.

&gt;I've thought about checking the heads but I'd rather not take them off? Any
comments?

	I'd stick with the compression test, but at 60K you are getting into new
head territory...
	Also look at the valve stems, do any stick up further than the
others...that would be a seat coming out.

&gt;I've checked the archives (most stuff I search under is about removal) I
remember this was on the list just a few weeks ago &gt;but they're not in the
archives yet, should have saved those
