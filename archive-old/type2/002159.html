Hey fellas, this is my first post.  I've owned a couple of bugs before
(a 71 and a 67) and still own my wife's '00 NB.  I have about four grand
to get a vehicle with, and I need a daily driver.  However, I'm also an
outdoors-oriented guy and love camping.  I now have a choice:

1) A white '72 Westy popper, great condition, with gas heater and tent
2) A silver '57 Oval on a '75 std pan, very nice, Porsche wheels

It is tearing me up, between a heavy, roomy camping van and a small, rare
oval.
Any thoughts?

Wade
