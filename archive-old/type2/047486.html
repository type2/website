&gt;1) 2 hoses etc.

&gt;2) Large vented square unit under the Bus covering the large air duct? Is
&gt;this a BN6?

Air conditioning condensor, check for other remains.  I assume you mean
a louvered steel thing.  That is in fact, likely a DPD conversion (the nicer
system.) does it have an under dash unit or hoses back to a nonexistent
compressor?  Should be hoses running to and fro under the bus.  A BA6
is a grey painted or gold cad plated sort of thinky looking a bit like a big
flat american style catalytic converter but thinner, and is in the big hose
line.  You got remains of A/C.  Fairly common by the late 70's.  Hell if you
have the under dash unit, and it is a 2 fan DPD model, I'm interested.  You
could also have a ceiling mount model, those for regular buses, under
dash for Westy or sunroof, but those weren't hard and fast rules.
