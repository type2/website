Subject: Paint formulas

I'm trying to get formulas for Mango Green and Seagull Grey. It seems
that the local paint suppliers can mix seagull grey in Acrylic Urethane,
which is fine with me, but they can't find a formula for Mango Green.

My plan is to have all rust spots taken down to bare metal, as well as
my whole roof.  The rest of the bus will just be sanded.  My plan is to
use an epoxy primer, then (possibly) a high build primer,  finally
paint.

I really have no idea about paint, and it appears as though I may be
doing the painting myself, after having the body work and priming
professionally done. I mean, how hard can painting be, I'll just
practice a bit then shoot the paint.   I just don't think it is worth my
time to do the work on the rust spots when I can get a pro to do it for
$20.00/hr.

Any, advice as to what type of paint I should use would be appreciated.
I am leaning towards Acrylic Urethane because I can get the formula for
one of my colours and it seems like less work than base coat / clear
coat.

I realize I could just take off maybe my radio block off plate or
something and the paint store could match the colour but I can't believe
that 40 year old paint hasn't faded at least some.  I would rather have
a formula for the original.

Anyway, thanks in advance.
