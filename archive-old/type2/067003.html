I'm not 'flaming' Jeff, I fully understand his feelings having had a 
non-resistance coil fitted without an external resistance.

How-ever the parts manual for a 'loaf' shows two types of coils, one of them
has a sort-of mini-coil by the side of it. 
I've always wondered what this was and when the posting came in about external
resistors to coils I thought that's what it must be.

Now I'm puzzled again. If as Jeff says external resistor coils were never used,
then does anybody know what this part is?
