Was it a bus, or a Vanagon?

We've seen a yellow/gold Vanagen (campmobile) cruising around the  
Charleston area, but rarely.

Of course our 69 Westy (Green with flowers painted on, and the odd  
gnome) is seen driving all over Mount Pleasant.

What are you guys driving?

&gt; Also, we just saw our first bus since moving to South Carolina.  It  
&gt; was driving down Old Trolley Road in Summerville.  We got really  
&gt; excited and honked and waved like crazy, but ended up just freaking  
&gt; out the teenage kid driving it.
