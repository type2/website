Subject: Tires, here we go again!!!

Hey Y'all,
I really hate to bring this subject up again, but can
someone tell me the biggest size tires I can fit on
the rear of my 71 westy keeping stock rims and making
no further alterations. I want to gain some height
more than the width, I'd like to get a little taller
tires on the back to help compensate a bit for my
saggy rear. I currently have 195\75 on it.

=====
Peace, John Baker

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
