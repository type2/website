Al and Dr. Tim: Thanks for your replies. Went to Sears over lunch break and
bought a charger. (Their &quot;Die Hard&quot; $65 model (2A/10A/60A with charge
controller) is on sale for $35.) We'll see if it's the battery. Note that I
bought this battery because I had the same problem with the previous one...
I'll keep you posted :)

Sami
