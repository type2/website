Subject: [T2] Boge shocks $16.95

I got another shipment of the Boge shock deal that was so popular on the
list a few months back.  I believe this will be my last shot at these.

These are original-equipment Boge shocks for 68-79 busses, made by
Boge/Mexico to OEM standards (and stock on the Mexi-Busses).  According to
Boge, these meet the same specs as the German VW/Boge ones that came
factory-equipped on your bus.  As with all stock VW bus shocks, these are
oil filled, not gas. In a nutshell, a oil shock will give your bus a
smoother ride than a stiffer gas shock, but will not have the
higher-performance handling (but rougher ride) of, say, a KYB.  Different
ride, different tastes.  Chocolate or vanilla, it's your call.  (If you
prefer a performance gas shock, the KYB's are $10 more.)

The story is the Boge was selling these under two brand names, Boge and
Technum, depending on the international market they were destined for.
Boge's marketing people have decided to drop the Technum name and sell them
strictly as Boge's from now on, so I got a closeout on the Technum boxed
ones.  This is the identical shock, comes to me directly from Boge, and even
has the &quot;official&quot; Sachs/Boge sticker on the end of the box.  Only
difference is, they're just $16.95 each.  This is about what you would
normally pay for &quot;discount house&quot; shocks, and about half the price of what
Boges usually sell for.

Part number 211 413 031P for front, 211 513 031R for rear.  Both on the
website, or you can order by part number toll-free at 1-888-819-DEPOT.
