Subject: Re: [T2] Info needed on AFM tuning by wideband -- desired AFRs

Adjust the AFM spring tension so you are around 12.8-13:1 at WOT. Then
adjust the air bypass so your idle is adjusted per Bentley. I do not
&quot;target&quot; A/F readings at idle, I let the engine tell me what it likes by
responding to the bypass screw.

don't forget a 009 is sucking off 3-5mpg, if you are running one. SVDA is
where it's at.
