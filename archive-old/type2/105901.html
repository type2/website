Subject: fuel pump relay

Hi List,

I have been reading the archives on safely replacing a mechanical fuel
pump
with an electric rotary style pump.  

See this post: 
http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/relay.html


Many of the posts suggest installing a relay from a mid-eighties
volkswagen
or Audi to cut off the pump when the engine stops.  Part # 321 906 059C

Does anyone know where the relay would be located on a mid eighties
cabriolet?  I found one at a salvage yard, but have no idea what a relay
looks like or where to find it on the motor.  A picture would be
awesome!
Also, would this be a part that a FLAPS would stock?  VW dealer wants
160
bucks new!! 

Thanks, and happy bussing!
Ed
