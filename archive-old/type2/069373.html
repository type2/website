Subject: Paintjob, police (was Re: VW weekend)

&gt;For the record, deast, what was the agreed price on the paintjob?

$2200 labor for bodywork and spray
$500 paint, reducer, hardener, etc.
$300 replacement body panels

&gt;You live in a far more tolerant place than I.  Here in Dallas Texas, you would be
&gt;cited just for having the five busses!  Even if they all ran!!

I live on the corner of two dead end streets.  The 3 houses that are 
right next to my property are all vacant (undergoing renovations).  
The only two inhabited houses where people have to go by my house are 
friends (they each allow me to park a bus in their driveways when I 
need to) and they didn't call the police.  Whoever did call lives down 
the street and has no business even coming into my part of the 
neighborhood.  That was the part that pissed me off.

Dave
