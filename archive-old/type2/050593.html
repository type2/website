&gt;Hi,
&gt;I just recently purchased a 78 Westy.  I looked at the beam and didn't
&gt;see any visible rust. Where exactly should
&gt;I look? Any advice would  be great.

Both towers that mount the two tubes.  Take a screwdriver or an awl,
go poking.  Something I mentioned to Dolan a few years back that is
around the salt belt, just cause there is grease on the outside, does
not mean it is &quot;protecting&quot; the metal below it.  To the contrary grease
holds dirt that gets wet and holds salt.  Poke/lightly scrape up and down,
particularly lower around where the bottom tubes goes through and
where the bump stop mounts go in.  And MOST importantly, have
a real close look at the center pin mount, look at the juction of it to
the beam and the condition of the pressed mount part itself, poking
around.  I've driven a bus when the pin came loose at 35mph or so.
No steering effect instantly, not too funny.  Degrease it when you are
satisfied and happy, scrub it down with whatever, then give the whole
beam a nice coat of brush on rustoleum.  Some say fill the entire
towers with grease, I don't know about that.  I would say make sure
the drains in the bottoms of them are open, and maybe spray some
cold galvanizing aerosol rustoleum up the drains using one of those
little red tube thingies from a WD-40 can.
