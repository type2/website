From: &quot;Kathy and Paul&quot; &lt;pa.ka_at_verizon_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Don't forget, you are also paying the electric, heating and
air-conditioning, state, local and federal taxes incurred by the business,
waste disposal and on, and on, and on.  Just imagine how much cheaper the
parts would be if you didn't have to pay for all that stuff.

Thank you!
