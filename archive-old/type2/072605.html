&gt;  OTOH - if you want to experiment, you may want to look for an
&gt;inexpensive oscilloscope (radio/tv repair places, on-line auctions,
&gt;classified ads, etc.).  Hooking the o-scope leads to the FI plug will
&gt;allow you to see the entire pulse (if the o-scope does not have internal
&gt;syncronization, the picture may jump from side to side - minor problem)
&gt;instead of an averaged value.

David: What is the maxiumum voltage of the  pulse on an injector?  Is it
within range of an ordinary scope? Does one simply  clip a lead onto the
injector terminal and display the 12V pulse on the scope?
