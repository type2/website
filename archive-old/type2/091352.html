Subject: '78 Westy LP Tank Replacement??

Hello Folks,

This is my first post, I've been lurking for a while
now.  I am the proud owner of a 1978 Dakota Beige
Westy Deluxe.  It needs some body work, engine work,
and camper work.  But it was a good find here in the
MidWest (Iowa).  Now to my question,  I'm not trusting
the underneath LP tank and am wondering about
replacing it.  GoWesty_dot_com has a replacement tank but
their catalog only indicates it as a replacement for
'80 - up.  Will this fit under my vehicle?  Are there
any other manufacturers who make something similar
that would work as well?  Thanks for all of your help!
