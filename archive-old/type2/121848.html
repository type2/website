Subject: RE: [T2] Adjusting flaps/thermostat when in a warm climate?

Hey all...

I'm approaching the table today with olive branches firmly in BOTH hands
out where you all can see them...

I reviewed the info that Craig K. provided on search/archive last night
WRT Poppa Ken and the world famous thermostat autopsy sessions, and the
searches also revealed that we have ALL propounded the same thing off
the same page out of the same book...  Now we just need to rally the
troops and fight the forces of evil that would have us 86ing the
thermostat and flaps/vanes because they are the Devil's Henchmen
designed by a bunch of villainous maroons out to have us drive our
beloved cars to wrack and ruin...

And then Chris said:  &quot;...In fact the Corvair guys are using VW
thermostats in place of the OEM Corvair part since nobody is reproducing
them...&quot;  I stand corrected then...  Thank you Chris, now we know why
the gennie Type4 supplies dried up ;-)  We need to keep our supplies of
VW thermostats safe from the marauding bands of Corvair scoundrels...
Further on in your post you went on to say much of what has been
proposed in the past - why NOT be able to refill, resolder and reuse
them?  WRT your question as to what limits their expansion?  It's the
frame that supports them in both the T1 and T4 configurations.  This
goes back to my original contention that the only thing one needs to use
it the calibrated eyeball Mk. I for inspection - anything other than
full contraction at room temps = dead or dying thermostat.  No calipers,
manuals or other implements of destruction required.  Replace it and
drive on...

Dave, Chris - I've got a dead gennie Wahler T4 thermostat I'd be willing
to throw your way for experiments... somewhere.  I also think the
thermostat on my '73 may be going &quot;squishy&quot;, so if I can't find the one
off the 2260, I could send that one out your way for reanimation...
Wahler also makes the later bug w/ FI thermostats (as supplied by my VW
FLAPS) - IIRC the last time I examined one, I &quot;think&quot; the cover end of
it that carries the bolt is soldered down around the perimeter, but it
would probably make more sense to drill a hole for the refill.  One of
the stories I have heard floated at one time regarding the &quot;dry up&quot; of
gennie T4 thermostats was that the manufacturer had gone toes-up.  My VW
FLAPS had supplied Wahler T4 thermostats for years, so imagine my
surprise when the late bug thermostat shows up in a Wahler box :-0  And
why, oh why, did Wahler make the late T1 thermostats with a slightly
different thread pitch on the little stud holding down the extension?
If you remove the extension for use in a T4, the same little threaded
stud is there, but just don't try to fit the T4 cap nut on it :-/  Makes
no sense, T4 was around for years before the bug went FI, so why'd they
make the stud a different thread pitch?  Seems like it would have made
more sense to have made the threaded extension the same thread pitch as
the T4 thermostat, and not a new thermostat end piece...

In closing, the one and only person who admitted to actually
owning/touching/smelling/feeling a dead and &quot;failed closed&quot; thermostat
has not provided any conclusive evidence that the thing was NOT somehow
defectively manufactured, perhaps with no alcohol, or missing spring, or
majik smoke...  He had relayed to me that it was installed on a Florida
bus since time remorial, and I contend that it's possible that even in
the dead closed position it's possible to have adjusted the flap
assembly (it's a later T4 powered bus) around the defect, and not
roasted the motor in a nonce.  He also contends that there are a mess of
&quot;failed closed&quot; thermostats out there, as evidenced by stories in
cyber-land, and I'll counter that by saying it's possible a mess of
thermostats were defectively manufactured and got by QC/QA 'cause it was
beer Monday...  And besides, everything you read from cyber-land is
God's Own Truth brand of truth, isn't it?

Parts purveyors to the masses, what say you?  Has there ever been a
rash/plethora/surfeit of &quot;OMG, you just sold me a thermostat that was
non-functional out of the box...&quot; returns?  I'm talking the good stuff
here, not questionable cheese...  My Wahlers have always lasted a couple
of years (2-3 or so) in daily driver service, and when they croak, I
replace them.

And on that note - I'm done and off to BBB8 tomorrow morning at Oh Dark
Hundred...

Cheers/Ciao/OffVidersayne/Whattheheckareyoulookingat  &lt;---but I mean
that in a nice way :-)
