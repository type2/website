The Factory installed the 1600cc upright engine in the 72-79 but they had
tin that was designed for this. You may still be able to get it from Ron at
Bus Depot. I can not stress enough the importance of getting a good seal,
this is a must!! If you do not, hot air will flow up and around into the fan
and it will blow hot air on a hot engine, thus not cooling it. If you must
go this route, do it right. If you do not, you will be very sorry! If you
can not get the right tin, make your own out of sheet metal.

I have a '72 Bus (station wagon), putting a '71 engine in it.  The engine
bay is quite a bit bigger than the Type I engine.  What are the suggestions
as to how to put tin around the engine and bay area to seal it off, and how
important is it to do this.
