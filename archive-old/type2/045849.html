our blueprinted pumps fit the type 4 and waterboxer engines too! We have
been doing this for over a decade.

&gt; &gt;I got an E-mail from listee Jeff Martin, he had run across a old post
from
&gt; &gt;Bob Hoover, in this message he stated in passing that the oil pumps from
a
&gt; &gt;type 1 motor will fit into a type 4 motor. He said this due to the fact
that
&gt; &gt;the t4 pumps are very expensive and the t1's are cheap. He said to use
the
&gt;
&gt; You do have to watch a bit.  A 3 bolt? high volume pump should work in
either.
&gt; In fact the Bugpack 3034? is sold for the T4 or as an iron bodied (Melling
&gt; style)
&gt; pump for the T4 and the T1.   BUT...
&gt;
&gt; Pelican Parts of Porsche supply notes the pump does not ALWAYS fit
perfectly.
&gt; Sometimes the drive tab is too long and needs ground a bit so that the oil
&gt; pump
&gt; doesn't load up the cam thrust bearings.  Easy enough to realize if you
are
&gt; building
&gt; the engine as you just lay the cam in and the pump and look, but not so
&gt; apparent
&gt; when you are just putting in a new pump if you had some reason to do so.
They
&gt; have pictures at pelicanparts_dot_com or something like that.
&gt;
&gt; I'd always measure carefully the length to the end of the drive tab from
&gt; the case
&gt; seating surface compare it to a T4 then install.
&gt;
&gt; Something else I pmailed to someone, the pump is not a particularly great
idea
&gt; being iron cased anyway.  After a few years they leak, and they can set up
&gt; galvanic corrosion, iron and aluminum don't mix expansion wise or electric
&gt; potential wise.  I've used it, but this time am actually just figuring
&gt; using an OEM
&gt; manufacturer high volume (30mm gear) T1 pump instead with a regular
aluminum
&gt; housing and the lipped steel coverplate, exactly oddly enough what VW
started
&gt; using on the Wasserboxer.  A bonus of any of these is that you can
&gt; &quot;blueprint&quot; the
&gt; gear to housing length by  carefully polishing it away on a piece of
&gt; wet/dry on
&gt; glass or something equally flat.  It amazed me that AVP, Stephens, and
&gt; others send
&gt; out rebuilds often with used T4 pumps which can not be logically rebuilt
&gt; due to the
&gt; complex way they are made when a high volume T1 pump is a whopping $40 or
so.
