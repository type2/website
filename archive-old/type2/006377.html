My personal tool box is atleast a 25K investment...Tools are not cheap, and
my Snap on tools are worth every dolar they cost, a full day of wrenching
with craftsman tools is much harder on my hands..

All our equipment (tools and diagnostics, as well as milling machines and
lathes) is probably well over 100K, even in used condition...

Tools are a good investment, they never go down in value.

&gt; &gt; I think this is an important point.  I work in a shop myself, and have
&gt; &gt; to buy most of the tools that I use.  Just installing my engine and
&gt; &gt; tranny I would say I used about $1500 worth of tools.  These were just
&gt; &gt; simple hand tools mind you...
&gt;
&gt; Yow!  They must be made of tempered gold!  I doubt that my modest tool
&gt; chest that I use for everything I do cost more than $500.  Well, there is
&gt; that 15mm box wrench that I needed to loosen the Mexican-sized valve lock
&gt; nuts.  I sent my wife to Sears to buy it, so if you count the cost of the
&gt; wife, the wedding, and the two children I guess I have a pretty tidy sum
&gt; tied up in my tools...  :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The amount of money spent on tools by mechanics is just insane.  Keep in
&gt; &gt; mind most of us &quot;buy off the truck.&quot;  These are tools such as Matco
&gt; &gt; (what I usually buy), Snap-on, Mac, etc...  A nice basic wrench set can
&gt; &gt; easily run you $300.
&gt;
&gt; I know that buying off the truck is convenient, but geeze, does the Matco
&gt; guy sell crack too?
&gt;
&gt; OTOH, what you are paying for when you hire a mechanic is the knowledge
&gt; between his ears.  If you find a good one, this knowledge is invaluable,
&gt; as the job will be done right the first time.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, mechanics of this caliber are few and far between.  As the
&gt; old VW ad said, &quot;Are you paying someone to learn how to work on your VW?
