&gt; Here's a related question.... Did VW change the length of the connector

&gt; I have a 1973 connector tube in the westfakia and the FI accellerator
&gt; cable I am using comes up a couple inches too long. AFAIK I have the
&gt; correct cable, so I am supposing that the problem is with the 1973
&gt; connector tube being too short.

Greg,

When I transplated the '78 engine into the '73, I transplated *everything*
even vaguely FI related, including the transmission support, the throttle
cable and that tube.  I had no problems.  Since you are getting the cable
tru the front tin, you must have transplanted the trans support... the
throttle cable tube comes out in a different place on the FI. I am
thinking either the tube changed (likely, but should not make a much of a
difference) or you still have the dual-carb throttle cable, which will be
too short.
