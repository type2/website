Subject: 75 Bus For Sale

It is time for my son and I to sell our 1975 fuel injected bus, so the
question is how much can I get for it?
I purchased the bus in May of 1998. It runs very well, has 25,000 miles on a
$1,200.00 rebuild.  I would drive this bus any ware and my son does just
that.  Besides driving to and from school and around town every day, he
drives almost every weekend from Rancho Cucamonga to Santa Barbara to see
the girlfriend, about 260 miles round trip and has been doing this for a
year.  This bus has never broke down on us!
 
Although this is not a pop top camper, the bus was converted by Riviera
(Sticker in door frame) and has a rear seat with storage under that folds
down into a bed and a cabinet and seat with more storage behind the driver.
These items are out of the bus and need recovering.  Originally purchased in
Washington state the bus has no catalytic converter and passes California
smog without a problem every two years.
 
The driver and passenger seats were rebuild and covered with Sew Fine
Upholstery about two years ago but I noticed the passenger seat has a broken
spring that has poked two small holes.
 
The only problems are, windshield wipers not working, turn signals not
working,( has brand new turn signal switch?), drivers side window bracket in
door broken.  There may be some other little thing that I have not seen
since my son is the daily driver.  There is some surface rust and the paint
is original
 
1800 fuel injected motor has 25,000 miles on $1,200 rebuild
New Muffler and tail pipe  3 months a
Good tires
Good Trans
New windshield and seal 6 months ago
Fuel lines replaced 4-5 months ago
 
 
There is some surface rust and the paint is original.  
There are some spare parts:
2 new fuel filters
2 new sets of points
16 new sparkplugs
New FI seals
New distributor cap
New Alt belt
New Clutch cabal
New air filter
 
All in all, and for what it is worth, I have about $4,000.00 invested and
realize I will never get this much for it so I am looking for your help in
finding a fair price and would like to offer it to a list member first.  I
just took some photos today so if anyone want to help determining what price
I can sell for or is interested please email me at don_miller1_at_hotmail_dot_com
