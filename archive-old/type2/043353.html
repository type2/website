&gt; Someone had mentioned a
&gt; diagnotic test to see if it is the cold start valve; my husband said
&gt; disconnect it and see if it runs worse with it disconnected, is this
&gt; valid?  thanks!

Beth-

The cold-start valve normally operates for only about the first 10
seconds after you start a cold engine.  You might have two sorts of
problems with the valve:

- If it's failed, starting will be difficult.  If it's currently hard to
start when cold, and disconnecting the lead to the cold-start valve
doesn't make it any harder to start, then it may be bad.

- If the valve is stuck *on* (either leaking or getting a signal when it
shouldn't) then your engine will run too rich when warm - like having
the choke stuck on.  In this case, your engine should run *better* with
the valve removed.

You might also run through the diagnostic procedure in Bentley and check
the archives for more hints.

Cheers,
Alistair

&gt; thanks to all who replied to my cold start valve question.  The only
&gt; thing is, and I guess it is my fault because I didn't word it
&gt; correctly,
&gt; the running funny problem was present BEFORE I changed the oil, it
&gt; didn't just show up after I changed it.    Beth and the '78
