Subject: Gas tank blues

I've got an 80 Vanagon &quot;Roger&quot; that has a leak. The leak appears to be
the expansion tank on the drivers side. Until I can find another one,
would it be a problem to pull the lines out of the tank and splice them
together, so I bypass the tank altogether? I'm not real clear what the
purpose of this tank is. Your help is greatly appreciated as always.
Mike
