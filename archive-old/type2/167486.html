&gt; Have you checked your cold start valve? If it is leaking it will over-rich

&gt; run super-rich.

unplugged it, no change in operations.   I guess it could be leaking
constantly but how does that explain the lack of power and top speed.  can
understand the accel part but not the top end and power problem.????


&gt; Just a start.

further along than where I am, really stumped

Thanks
