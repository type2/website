Subject: A Possibility?

If someone fairly close to the Boston area has storage space for a bus but
does not have money to buy a bus, perhaps you would be interested in
storing my bus and selling it?  Then you could keep say, half the money
you get out of it?  If it sells for 1000 dollars, you send me 500?  My
problem is I don't have space, time, or money out here in the East and I
need to get back west to Utah ASAP.  Please contact me immediately at
mindmesh_at_yahoo_dot_com if this is a possibility.  Leave a phone number I can
call you at if possible.
Stranded,
Daniel
