Hi Thom,
You'll have to start letting loafs register.  I was just at your site trying
to register and even had dug up my VIN, body #, and engine # before I got to
the year field and realized I couldn't register anyway!  You'll have to
include us type2_dot_com folk now that you've put out the invitation.  Right?
;-)
Later,
-C
