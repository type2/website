I think this should work rather well. The only difficulty you may have is 
getting the right amount of stretch in whatever material you put up there 
-- enough that it doesn't sag, not so much that it pops the snaps. 
Remember that for many materials -- vinyl, cotton canvas, etc. -- this 
can change with temperature or humidity.

Since you are in Cincinnati, which is a real city sort of, I would call 
around to awning and tent supplies to see if they have a remnant of 
Sunbrella fabric. This is the perfect use for it.

This idea would work even better if you loosely attach some of that 
bubble and foil insulation on the wrong side of the cover (that is, out 
of sight).
