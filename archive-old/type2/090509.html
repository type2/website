Subject: Broke bus

--0-1911682087-1026172242=:41906


Hello! I have a 1972 Bus with an 1800cc motor, last week while cruising in 4th the van suddenly lost power in all gears, the engine was still running and it idled fine but had no power on acceleration, so far I have replaced the electric fuel pump, leaky fuel lines, cap, rotor, filter,plugs,wires,points,condenser,and static timed the motor, the engine will fire up and run but only as long as keep my foot on the gas the instant I let off the gas the motor dies.

  I did notice that gas was seeping out of the side of the carb where the fuel inlet is, here is where I having even more trouble, I have no idea what carb is, it looks very much like the weber progressive I have seen in the books, the tag on it reads L7760 and under that 0440 and in the bottom of the float bowl it reads Holley licensed by Weber Italy is this carb a Weber 32/36 DFAV or something else? so based on the above info does anyone have a rough guess as what the problem might be?any help would be great, this is the first time in 7 years that  my baby is having problems.

Thanks,

Tim
