Subject: 76 resale value

You know, I just put up an ad for my friend's 76 westy that was in ok 
condition.. interior needed a bit of work and the exterior paint was 
quite faded and there were areas that needed work.  Yet, it sold for 
2950 in a heartbeat.  I wouldn't be surprised if a late bay westy goes 
for 4-5k, if not more.  That's pretty neat that our buses are holding value.

Just thought I'd mention that tidbit of info...

Mike
