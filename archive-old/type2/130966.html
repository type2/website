Subject: RE: [T2] carb trouble 34pict3

I have same setup and exact same carb. I had an original German Solex and it 
was just dead. Had my mechanic rebuilt it and it wouldn't come back to life 
and I ended up getting a new Mexican carb ($$$$$$$).

I have my old carb as a backup, it still runs but rough.

Do a FULL tune up on it, check compression and see if that effects it.  If 
points are shot or timing way off or you have dead cylinders it won't idle 
well even with a perfect carb. After that I would first rebuilt you carb and 
see if that can bring it back to life. Then maybe consider getting a new 
one. Carbs are meant to be fixed and not replaced but it's been rebuilt 29 
times it might be on it's last leg.
