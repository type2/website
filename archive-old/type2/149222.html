Subject: Re: [T2] Your TCWBC Subscriptsoin is ready

  Hi Mark,

The conservation authority rents out heated shacks for $20/person.  
There's a 2-person minimum on weekends. You can cut your own hole and  
fish in the open for free if you're so inclined.

The originally TCWBC concept was to drive out an hour north of  
Toronto to Lake Simcoe  in our buses and camp for free on ice a foot  
thick. But the week before the campout there was a snowstorm and the  
access roads to the lake were all 3' deep in snow. So we chickened  
out and found a campground with 'lectric hookups and flush toilets.  
They let us double-up on the campsites for #28/night. Been going back  
there ever since.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; As far as I know, there isn't a enough open water at Valens for  
&gt;&gt; swimming. Most of the holes in the ice are about 6&quot; to 12&quot; in  
&gt;&gt; diameter. Perfect for ice fishing, but very dangerous for swimming.

&gt;&gt; Last year I bagged my limit while Ice Fishing... But my wife near  
&gt;&gt; drowned trying to cook it. (Ba-dum-Bump).
