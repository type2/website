&gt;***************************
&gt;I just saw (and you probably did) a post from Marcus on the list and he's
&gt;in Maryland with a complete assy from a 79 which will interchange - check
&gt;him out. (mschaper_at_gvpt.umd_dot_edu)

Jim, thanks.

Marcus and I caught up on Sunday 7 Oct, and he gave me a '79 steering 
column/wheel, and I gave him a spare tire.  So, things work via long 
distance, too!! Thanks for the heads up.

BTW, previously, Karl von Salzen hooked me up with someone in Virginia Beach 
VA, 200 miles from me, who had some Sage Green Doors.  I visited and picked 
up some front doors, and a sliding door that I have to refinish.  Thanks 
again Karl.

So, you guys on the other side of the divide are helpful to us on the East 
Coast



&gt;Removing the pin is the way to go.  $45?  That's cheep compared to the
&gt;locksmiths here in California - they start at $55 to $75 here.  Guess it's
&gt;where the cost of living is highest.

Hey, a local locksmith said he would charge $35 to re-key the ignition 
lock!!  But I think I can get him down another $10!!

He did supply me with some ILCO 1092C blanks for the H2O lock, which I had a 
few cut to my code, and a few trimmed to the correct length.  Steve Sandlin 
put us on to the right key blank.

This is just one more example on how this VW community helps one another.

Soon to be seen in the grey market::  Type R key blanks with the VW logo cut 
right thru the head.  Obviously, a deep throat type thing.  Expected to be 
in country about Xmas time.  When I get mine, I will get a picture and pass 
it on.  Two years in the making.
