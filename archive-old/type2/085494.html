Subject: Re: [T2] progressive carb/filter pump

Jack O'Brien sends:

&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on hard piping an external oil filter?
&gt; I'm considering using copper tubing and brass fittings to run oil from
&gt; a CB Performance oil pump to the full flow filter. I can't think of any
&gt; problem this might cause but I've never seen it done before.
&gt; I would use 5/8&quot; tubing and the filter would be mounted to the
&gt; engine mount so that vibration should not be a problem.

I can think of one big problem: copper is a very soft metal, it may
eventually rupture. I would think hard about using braided stainless hose to
the filter; that will remain intact.
