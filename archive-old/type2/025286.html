Hi Volks,

Yesterday was a very educational experience.

I rented Das Über-Kamper to a film company to shoot a trailer for the
&quot;Discovery Award&quot; to be handed out at the Toronto International Film
Festival. This is the award given for the best movie in the festival from a
first-time director. The trailer will be shown in theatres at the beginning
of every movie played by a first time director.

The film shoot started at 8:00 AM, and lasted until 10:00 PM, with shooting
at three different locations. At least 3 HOURS of 35mm film stock was
consumed, and about 25 people were involved in the production.

When I arrived I discovered that I shouldn't have bothered cleaning out the
bus before it went out... they had completely cluttered it with &quot;props&quot;.
(Director-speak for &quot;intentional littering&quot;) The dashboard was under an 8&quot;
layer of cassette tapes, maps, dollar store wind-up toys, twinkie wrappers
and pizza crusts. There were fuzzy dice hanging from the mirror and strips
of duct tape on the dash. What a mess, but it did suit the plot perfectly.

Oh yes... The Plot:
A first time Director goes out with her crew in the VW bus to shoot a sunset
scene, but by the time they get the gear loaded and the site scouted the sun
has already set. Under the &quot;Bela Lugosi&quot; monster lighting of the headlights,
someone says &quot;Anyone want to shoot a Horror Movie?&quot;.

The first scenes were set in the warehouse district of town, not far from
the grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition. The actual site of the
shoot was an alley between two decrepit warehouses, one of which was in the
process of being demolished. From some angles the CN Tower is featured
prominently, and the sun glinting off the downtown office towers looked
excellent. In these shots they loaded the VW with gear and drove off. It
took about 3 hours here to get the shots they wanted.

My personal role in the production was &quot;Van Tech&quot;, responsible for keeping
the bus running. This was mostly just a matter of sitting around, and
occasionally moving the bus so they could frame a shot while the real driver
was in make-up or otherwise unavailable. On top of that, I also shot 2 rolls
of stills with a 35mm camera they provided and almost 40 shots with my own
digital camera. 

For the 2nd scene, they wanted the bus to have smoke from the tail-pipe as
it drove away from the camera. I backed off a spark plug to pour in some
oil, as suggested by a couple of list-members. This is where Murphy's Law
reared its ugly head, as I dropped the $^% spark plug and could not retrieve
it from between the engine tin and the motor. With a camera crew and 15
people standing around watching, I fished around for 20 minutes, but I could
not get at the plug with the tools at hand. No-one had a magnet, and sticky
tape just wouldn't hold on long enough. Finally, just as I was ready to
admit defeat and order in for a plug delivery, I remembered there was a plug
for my 78 KE-100 dual-sport bike in the glove compartment. Even more
wonderful, IT FIT!!!! . What I would have done if it had punched a hole in
the #2 piston is something I'd rather not think about.

The shot wasn't delayed more than 3 or 4 minutes, and it did turn out pretty
good. They made me pilot the Bus for the drive-away scene, as they wanted
just a little wheel-spin in the gravel, but not enough to damage the camera.
It was amazing how hard it becomes to do a simple thing like start the bus
and pull away when there's a camera pointed at you. There wasn't much smoke
(I probably missed the plug hole when I was pouring), but they got the shot
they needed and they loaded everything back into the vans to head for the
2nd location.

En-route to the 2nd location, they shot some traffic scenes, driving through
the CNE grounds and heading up onto the QEW to drive across the bottom of
Toronto's Downtown. I had to lay in the bottom of the Bus floor, and operate
the radio, relaying instructions from the camera van to the 5 actors
whooping it up and hollering as they all hung out the windows and hammed it
up for the camera. Once we were out of downtown we pulled over to wait for
the crew van to catch up and take the actors to the second location, and
they shot a scene with the director checking the motor and getting flack
from the crew to get back on the road and get moving. While we were pulled
over we had to wave off three helpful tow-trucks, it was kinda amusing under
the circumstances.With that shot over, I got back behind the wheel and we
headed off to find some gasoline, I figured that would be a much safer place
to transfer the actors and the crew van could catch us just as easily there
as on the side of the highway.  After filling up with gas I had the bus to
myself for an hour as we drove to the 2nd location; almost enough time to
chill out and relax.

The first thing we all did when we got to the 2nd location was try to find a
place to take a leak. Yes, they filmed that too. (not me, just the actors. I
waited for the Winnebago.) Then we broke for lunch, and the food was every
bit as you've probably heard.. I had salmon, mashed potatoes, baby carrots
and fresh fruit and cookies for dessert. After lunch they shot a lot of
interior dialogue and Point-Of-View stuff, so I sat back and put my feet up,
and read a couple chapters of the book I took with me. And I shot some more
pictures of the action with the still camera and my digital.

The final location was where the sunset was filmed. The crew drives up in
the van, and leaps out the sliding door OVER the camera so they can get out
and get the sunset filmed. Of course, that's when they jam the door shut, a
hilarious but frustrating moment ensues as they're stalled with the camera
running but the actors in the van are unable to open the door. Finally I
walked over, twisted the handle briskly and pulled the door open smooth as
glass. A short lesson in VW door opening procedures later, they were ready
for another take.

That scene over, they bring out a chrome VW logo for the front of the bus.
Well, it used to be chrome... now it's tarnished and corroded looking. They
hang it on the front of the bus with one screw and a peice of sticky tape,
then we try to get a shot timed so that just as the lights go on the logo
comes unglued and swings sideways on its remaining screw mount. This proved
very difficult, as it would always let go to early or too late... I think we
shot about 15 takes before they were happy with it.  Around take #10 they
asked if the lights would be brighter with the motor running... and (you
guessed it) the battery was already too weak. With panic rapidly taking
hold, I calmly put the van in reverse, release the parking brake, and
bump-start it after rolling about 5 feet. Once the motor is running I pulled
back up to the camera to massive applause from crew and spectators, and I
leave the van running for the next 20 minutes to get the battery charged up
again.

All's well that ends well, I had a good time and learned a lot about film
production. With 14 hours needed to shoot 30 seconds, I can't imagine doing
a two-hour film.  Personally, I'm going to leave the creation of the
web-page version of this report alone for a day or two,  but I'll post a
link to it when it's up. There are about 40 pictures to colour correct,
resize and sharpen, and I have enough to do right now ccleaning up the mess
they made of the van.

In September the trailer will be in theatres, and VW of Canada picked up the
tab. 

Happy trails,
