Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Discount Tires (and Snows!) for Busses

I don't know about anyone else, but I occasionally find that the 'Depot 
online catalog is written in a confusing way, or leaves out information 
that's necessary to make a buying decision.

Ron, I would be glad to let you know about confusing information on 
your site -- and I'm sure that other listees would be glad as well -- 
if we thought that you would take action to make the site better.

This business about the rims is perhaps a case in point. But earlier 
this week I needed to e-mail the sales address to make sure that the 
reconditioned crankshaft I bought uses standard bearings, and was not 
recut. That may be obvious to you, but it wasn't to me.
