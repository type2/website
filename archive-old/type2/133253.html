&gt; Out of no where, I have zero juice to the key.
&gt; I can connect jumper cables, and it starts.  Remove the cables and you can
&gt; hear the power drop.
&gt; My conclusions, with Bentley help.... alternator or (now I cant even
&gt; remember)
&gt; Bentley wasn't real clear, seemed to be more for the generator on a 1600.
&gt; This is a 78 FI.

personally I would disconect and charge the battery, then do the battery
drain circuit testing until I found the reason the battery was going flat,
if  it is the Volt reg or alt it would be also shown, but I suspect first
you may have a short or crossed circuit that is draining the juice.
