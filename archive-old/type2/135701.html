Subject: Re: [T2] Monza style exhaust,

You do realize I bought it from you, right? 

;-)

I know it will never last like an OEM style one. However, at the time
I needed something to replace my crimped factory muffler and I was
poor (Was? Shoot.. am!):

I like the exhaust note from the Empi however. Plus, when/if I need to
replace it I've been considering just welding in a pair of cherry
bombs keeping the flanges and pipes. They do seem a bit tougher than
the mufflers themselves.

As for coatings: Duplicolor has a &quot;High Temp&quot; paint made for exhaust.
Supposedly rated to 1200 degrees. &quot;With Ceramic!&quot; LoL! Right...
Anyway, $6 a can at Kragen, I'm using it on my HEs and muffler. The
adhesion on the HEs so far has been impressive. We'll see how it holds
up in real use though.


&gt; The $60 price difference for an OEM type setup will pay for itself several
&gt; times over. The quality difference is day and night. You have not yet
&gt; learned this because your monza-style system is only a few months old, but
&gt; unfortunately you almost certainly will.
