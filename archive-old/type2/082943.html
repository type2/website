Subject: Re: [T2] CV Joint Swap

As long as both buses are stick shifts the entire axles will swap.

However, I've found that age is not a great predictor of CV joint life.
If they've gone this long, they're likely to last a good deal longer.  I
wouldn't go to the trouble of changing them out until the boots have a
problem!

&gt; Folks, I'm about to remove the CV Joints and axles on the '76 and swap them for some that are newer off the
&gt; parts bus.  It's a '77 and I'm just wondering if I might be getting myself into trouble with the swap.  Do
&gt; they fit, any alterations I need to know?
&gt; I know the PO of the '77 and he is a very good VW guy who cared alot about doing things right so I'm sure the
&gt; joints and axle's are good.
&gt;
&gt; Any tips'd be appreciated...
