Subject: [T2] Re: Performance Tyres.

Hi Stephen,

&gt; Now I know tires have been done to death on this list but I'm after
&gt; something a little different.  Does anyone know of a suitable tire with
the
&gt; right load rating in a 235/65/15 and 215/65/15.

 Pirelli do their P6000 in a 215/65R15 reinforced, the P4000 is available in
225/65R15, both with high load and speed indices (and no doubt high prices,
too!). You can get an Avon Turbospeed CR39 in a 225/65R15, too. These are
OEM fit for an Aston Martin and would probably make the Pirellis look cheap
(£400/corner rings a bell). I havn't found a 235/65, yet.
 
 The difficulty is finding a tyre designed for a car with similar 
characteristics to a fast bus: Big, powerful saloons are about the closest
match in terms of performance and weight so what's needed is a tyre made
for one of those in the right rolling radius. At this level of performance
they tend to be made in lower profile designs: it may be better to increase
wheel size and reduce tyre profile to get a suitable match. it might be 
worth looking at the tyres fitted to big Holdens, Mercs etc. to see if 
there are any that look like they might fit your needs. 
 I have been trying to check out the Michelin Pilot CX ranges (designed
for Limos, I think, but their website just times out on me). IIRC there may
be an appropriate version there, though again the price may be silly.

 Are you looking for an off-road capable tyre, too? If so then I can't
offer much advice, though I notice that Porsche have asked Pirelli to
develope a tyre specifically for their new Cayenne to accomodate its
offroad and performance capabilities. I wonder if there's a Rangie tyre
that could be used on your bus?

Cheers,
	 W.
