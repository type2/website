Subject: Re: [T2] overfilling your oil???

How long did it take for Phillip's brother to discover
that half of the quart he 'filled&quot; his engine with was in the filter?
If the marks were a quart apart, then what happens ?
It might be better to maintain the level within a pint, rather
than allowing a full quart as an acceptable low limit.
