&gt;As for your other questions:
&gt;1. I didn't bother with a compression test since the engine was straight
&gt;out of the crate.  Probably wouldn't hurt, though.

You should take a baseline reading so you can track the changes later.

&gt;2. I don't have the engine # with me right now, but Erin (sp?) at AVP
&gt;agreed there should have been a hole tapped and she was puzzled as to
&gt;why there was not.  I'm just glad they're going to reimburse me the
&gt;expense.

Because they are sloppy at checking what you ordered is what they are shipping.

&gt;3. I don't know the part # on the head - would have to take a look.  By
&gt;the way, where is the part #?

Under the left rocker arm. It's hard to see but definately stamped there:
