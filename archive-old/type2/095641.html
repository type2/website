Subject: RE: [T2] Side tent 4 Bus

&gt; My lovely wife has decided that if we are going to be camping
&gt; with the entire
&gt; family, then we need to get a side tent for the rug rats. I saw BusDepot
&gt; advertise one for $199 in VW Trends and got VERY excited. However when I
&gt; called them tonight they said that they would not have them available for
&gt; another 2-3 weeks, but we need one by High Country Bus Festival. So, does
&gt; anyone know of a supplier where I can get a decent New side tent
&gt; for my bus, preferably for under $250?


The person whom you spoke to was being somewhat conservative in terms of
timeframe, which is probably good.  The tents have actually been Stateside
since the beginning of the month, but Customs has been very slow to process
the release. Whereas usually we could get a shipment from port to our door
within a couple of days, since 9/11 things move at a snails pace.  We had
hoped for a release today but now it's looking like sometime next week.
Taking that into account, plus shipping time to you, two weeks is not out of
the question.  Unfortunately, all I can do is wait until Customs gives it
the green light, same as I have been for over a week already.

I don't think you'll find another tent for under $250.  But we do have a
tent available right now, for $285 with listmember discount. This tent is a
bit higher-end than the $199 one we'll have, but lacks a sleeping cabin
(although one is available optionally). You can see it at
http://199.217.241.240/partsimages/awning2.JPG .  I believe this is the
cheapest new side tent available other than our own $199 tent.
