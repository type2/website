Subject: Motor out!

Today (happens to be my birthday) and we finally got to it.

Had it in the shop and the two of us had the complete motor
out (2liter fi) of the bus. I took off the gas shocks to put on the
new one and also the heater boxes.

It took us about 2.5 hours with some chatting on the phone.
Thursday we are going to take it apart, clean it, and see if
anything other than the cam bearing needs replacing.

Then once it's all beautified it goes into my 74' westy.
Along with the heater boxes and shocks and such.

The motor in the 74 (a 2 liter fi) will have the rings done in the
one cylinder (and anything else needing overhauling). It was pretty
simple. I am guessing it will take a little more to put the sucker back
in but I sure feel better about it having someone help me. By the
time the 2 motors are out and the good one back in I should be
an expert. ;)

I also got the stereo put in.. about 600 watts of power running
Infinity and Nakamachi speakers with Pheonix Gold 12&quot; sub.  All
classsily hidden from prying eyes looking like a nice little camper.
No more Ipod and headphones for me.

I took some pictures of the procedure and a few of the vehicles
that came around at the time.  One of the bus' he's working on is
a rare 15 window restoration. Some varying vintige bug restoration
projects from the ground up.  He's also got a drag racing bug
that does 12.33 in the 1/4.  It's been a blast of a day.

I will have some pictures up in a little bit. There was also a little
car called a thing or something?

Too much fun!

James
