Subject: leak down specs ?

Recently, one of our list members tipped me off to a nice dual-gauge 
leak down tester available from a mail order house.  Then in the 
Budget Beater article in the current issue of VW Trends, they show a 
leak down test being done during assembly of an engine. Seems like a 
good tool to have and a good test to make.

Before I invest in one of these $100 testers, I would like to know 
the specs or typical rates for our AC engines.

Does anyone do this test routinely?
What values are good for a nice tight combustion chamber?
  Shouldn't the test be done with the engine warm, instead of before 
break-in as is shown in the VWT article?

Thanks, Jack
