Subject: Charging Problem - Epilogue

Turned out that my charging problem was a bad brush.

I did the no-load test and got no output at all from D+ when grounding DF.

I then pulled the brushes.  The top brush was
still in good shape but the bottom brush (the hard-to-see one) was
bottoming out its braid against the brush holder.  I obtained new brushes
at the local NAPA FLAPS.  Their parts book showed that my '71 was equipped
with an alternator (in my dreams!), but we went back a couple of years to
find the correct part number.

Reconnected everything (the lower brush has to be installed by Braille!)
and voila! the light went out and stayed out!

Lesson learned #1:  When the top of the brush is even with the top of the
brush holder, it's time to replace both brushes.

Lesson learned #2:  Check both brushes.  Just because the top brush is OK
doesn't mean that the bottom brush is too.  Get out a flashlight and
mirror and check the bottom one too!

Thanks to all who offered suggestions.  Who needs Bentley when we have
the List!
