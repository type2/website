Subject: Re: Brand new German VW 2.0 liter engines F/S

&gt;Anybody else taking advantage of this?  I haven't seen a zero mile german
&gt;2.0 liter engine advertised.  Is this as rare as I think it is?
&gt;
&gt;I wondered, so I called Peter _at_ tiico_dot_com and not only is it for real but
&gt;the price is OUTRIGHT (no core or return shipping to mess with).  He told me
&gt;they come with new valve covers and are shipped in a genuine VW wood crate
&gt;with latches... Sweet!

The only question I have is, have these engines been sitting in the crates
assembled somewhere for 20 years?  If so, do people realize that these
engines might have to be disassembled, cleaned, resealed and reassembled
before use?  What is the shelf life of an assembled engine if all of the
precautions are taken (as was surely the case since they are VW)?
