&gt;OK---Give me some input---Is this ethical/Legal---Sounds like a fun
&gt;way to sell my bus and give at least 100 of us folks a $25 chance on
&gt;getting an OK Westy???

Count me in!  Where do I mail the 25.00 check?

How about the excess or some percentage goes to charity?

P.S.  Will you deliver in CA?
