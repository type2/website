Hi Greg...

&gt; I have an electric pump in the westfakia now, to feed the dual solexes 
&gt; that keep its 2L running. On my first outing I had one of the jet caps 
&gt; fall out of a float bowl and the engine died... but the electric pump 
&gt; carried merrily along continuing to keep the (leaking bowl) filled 
&gt; with gas. I was lucky to determine the problem and be able to get the 
&gt; family out and shut the ignition off before anything bad happened... 
&gt; there was raw gas spraying straight onto the engine tin on the drivers 
&gt; side. Once I let things cool down I put the plug back in the 
&gt; float-bowl and everything was fine. I am soon going to wire the 
&gt; electric pump to a relay on the alternator output, so the pump will 
&gt; not operate with the engine off. This will also save the pump from 
&gt; burning itself out if I run out of fuel.

I think you're going to need a slightly more complex trigger for the 
relay than just the alternator.  When you're starting the engine, the 
alternator output is probably not going to be enough to close the relay 
and allow fuel to flow to your carbs.  You'll probably also need to 
trigger the fuel pump relay from the &quot;start&quot; position on the ignition 
switch.

The stock FI fuel pump is actually triggered off the Air Flow Meter 
(which signals the fuel pump relay in the dual-relay block), so if the 
engine dies (thus closing the flap in the AFM), the fuel pump will 
stop.  If one were to install an electric fuel shut-off valve, you 
could probably tap right off the power supply for the pump.  The fuel 
pump relay is also triggered by the &quot;start&quot; position on the ignition 
switch, so that the fuel pump will run smoothly when starting (the AFM 
flap bounces when starting, which would cause the pump to run 
intermittently if that were the sole trigger mechanism).

I've grown to really like the stock L-Jetronic FI.  I was afraid of it, 
at first, since I'd only worked on carbs before (in my '72 Super Beetle 
and on old American cars when I was a kid).  But now, I think that it's 
actually easier to work on than carbs (especially dual carbs), and with 
all of the horror stories I hear of fuel line fittings falling out of 
carbs and spilling gas all over the place (like yours, for example :-), 
I think the stock FI is a lot safer, too.
