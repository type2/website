Subject: Re: [T2] Friday bus sightings

According to Georgia's post on the BSKA list Holly ended up on the cutting
room floor. It seems they didn't use any of the Chicago shots of her bus,
just the California shots of the other bus.

Here's a story about it from her local paper. I'm even in there because I
was doing a &quot;bus-relay&quot; to get Melvin (a '69 Westy) down here to Texas for
the kid across the street. Missed the photo op because they didn't show up
the day they were supposed to -- and they called me &quot;Gerland&quot; (??). And
that bit about having to OWN a bus to be a Buskatier -- Hmph! 
Oh well, I got to spend the day with a great lady and her family.

Douglas.H.Pillen_at_nwo02_dot_usace.army_dot_mil was heard babbling something about RE: [T2] Friday bus sightings:

&gt; The move is Cheaper by the Dozen, I saw a sneak preview last Friday and I
&gt; would give it a two thumbs up, it helps if you like Steve Marten also...
&gt; It will be out on the Dec 25th I think, here is a link to the move,
&gt; http://www.cheaperbythedozenmovie_dot_com/ I have meet the owner Georgia of
&gt; the
&gt; bus &quot;Holly&quot; once and she lives up near Chicago IL.
