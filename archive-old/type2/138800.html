Subject: Re: [T2] cht wiring

The tin is very similar on the Vanagon. I'll Take a look to see if I can
Sneek the cable out in this location. Is there a hole there or am I supposed
to make one?
Thanks

&gt;
&gt; Is the tin the same on the vanagon? The best way seems to be through the
&gt; back where the tin pieces meet:
