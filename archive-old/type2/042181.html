Subject: Re:Dead battery...again and again and again

The fact that you read 12 volts between the positive post and the now 
removed wire is not very diagnostic. It suggests that there is some 
connection between the wire and ground, but doesn't tell you how much 
current it will draw when you reconnect it to the battery. It could be a 
very large resistance, which may draw down the battery only over a long 
period of time, a moderate resistance that will drain it in a few hours, or 
a dead short to ground which will discharage it instantly and probably start 
a fire. So you need to use the ohmmeter function of the testor and see what 
the resistance to ground is as read at the disconnected positive post wire. 
The current that will be drawn by a measured resistance value (R) is V/R in 
amps, if R is in ohms. Then if the battery is rated say at a certain number 
of ampere-hours, the time in hours to discharge it is equal to 
amp-hours/amps. So basically what you want to do, once you measure the 
resistance to ground with everything off and all doors closed, is pull the 
fuses one at a time, and see which fuse, when removed, causes the the 
resistance to go way up. That will be the circuit to examine in detail to 
see which component is in the circuit when it shouldn't be there of is 
malfunctionning. Make sure you turn off all items, and close all the doors, 
etc when testing for resistance changes. If the resistance to ground is 
still low after pulling all the fuses, then look at the unfused items: such 
as the ignition switch. A circuit diagram will show you what items aren't 
supplied thru the fuse box. Ideally, the resistance should be infinite to 
ground when everything is shut down.  Sometime a very innocuous item such as 
a clock or a stereo (even when not is use) will draw a lot of current, and 
thus drain the battery in a few hours.
