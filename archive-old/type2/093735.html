Subject: Running rich &amp; high test &amp; engine temps

A few thousand miles ago, I had the engine rebuilt.

I had a few problems at first with running rough, but all that is sorted out now (mostly).

Having gone through a few oil changes/tune-ups, it is painfully obvious that the mixture is not ideal.
1)  MPG is about 17, formerly closer to 20
2)  Plugs are black

Formerly I had an extractor muffler on there, and during that time a mechanic I had been using drilled out the jets.  Now I am using a &quot;stock&quot; (bug) muffler and I suspect that the engine is &quot;breathing&quot; a little differently.  Does this make sense?

Where can I get a set of stock jets for a 31/3 PICT?

This last fill-up, I put in 93 octane.  Head temps went down 50 - 100 degrees! (I have the sender mounted on #3 exhaust pipe about 4 cm from the head).  Temps will generally range between 350 &amp; 400 degrees.  

As I pull hills, head temps go up and oil temps go down.  On the straights, head temps max out around 350 and oil temps vary with RPMS/MPH.  Generally, I settle in at about 3500 RPM, 65 MPH (showing), oil press 40-50 psi, head temps as above, oil temps around 230.

Thanks for the bandwidth, its been a long time since I've posted.  Usually I just read (lurk).  Problem is, not all posts come through.  It's still hard to keep up with the posts that do come through.  This forum has become WAY busy in the years that I have subscribed.
