Subject: [T2] getting Mark Kaylor's '78 running.

Whoops, I forgot... I was going to submit my diagnostic analysis for
comment...

The problem:  '78 FI bus.  Will crank, will not start, will not even puff
once or twice.

The diagnosis Mark received: injectors not firing, bad brain.

I went up there las weekend and checked the ignition, dwell was good at
51-3 timing (static) was at 5 *A*TDC on stock advance-only dist.  Reset
timing (static) to 7.5 BTDC.  No change.  Cranked engine and checked for
spark... spark is present.  Yellow, but present.

The wiring harness at the double relay was a mess!  this van, in common
with my '78 and my '73 had fried the wire leading to the fuel pump and the
plug had been cut off and terminals crimped on... a mess :-(  Nikki
shipped me a replacement plug with 8&quot; of wiring cut from a donor.  I
peeled the wires back and soldered (match solder :-( the ends together.
Still much crank, no fire.

I checked the voltage at the injectors... 0 volts while cranking...
previous mechanic was not a dumb as I gave him credit for :-), then
checked voltage at the supply to the brain (terminal 4).  this checked at
8.5 during cranking!!!  whoops!!!  As I remember, the brain need at least
10 to operate!

At this point my thoughts are:
(1) dead battery.  On an FI car it is perfectly possible to have enough
power to crank, but not enough left over to run the brain (the weak spark
also points in this direction)
(2) dying double relay.  I checked the input to the double relay and it
was 12.5 volts at the same time the output to the brain was 8.5.  I will
be bringing my known-good spare double relay to check this.

Anyone got any other thoughts on this???

Also checked were the voltage to the fuel pump... that is fine and the
other double relay checks... it passed them all
