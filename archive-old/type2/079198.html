Subject: wah wah wah wah - T/O Bearing?

that's what is happening when I press on the clutch. wah wah wah wah
wah..   Sometimes it's also doing it when I press lightly on the clutch
or not even pressing on it.. .. is this the T/O bearing going out?

What kinda ETA am I looking at until spontaneous kaboom occurs and the
thing dies?  I NEEEEEEEED to go try to pass smog tomorrow and the bus
started making this noise friday... on and off.. not too bad.. tonight a
little bit louder.. 

I think Steve Dolan posted something about this a while back, but I
couldn't find the post.. any input would be nice :)

Mike
