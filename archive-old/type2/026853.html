Coincidently there seems to be a lot of talk about oil temp sender units and 
I just happen to be shopping for these very things for my bus. I'm looking 
at purchasing VDO gauges and senders from Rocky Mountain Motorworks. The 
head gauge comes complete with sender no problem. What is a &quot;normal&quot; head 
temp to run??? Second, I'm offered two choices for oil temp senders; one is 
a drain plug sender while the other is a dipstick sender. There seems to be 
a lot of controversy over which one is better. Is a sump plate and drain 
plug sender the same thing? I'm thinking of going with the plug. Any pro's 
and con's with this??
