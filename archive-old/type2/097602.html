Subject: Re: [T2] 76 bus,help!!!

To my knowledge, there is no book...

But, here is what I did. The felt seal is to be installed around the perimeter
of the sunroof with the bead edge upward. I went to the local hardware store and
bought adhesive that bonds with metal and fabric and applied it to the seal as I
was installing it. A friend is helpful here to keep the 'glued part' on the
sunroof edge while you work carefully to not get grease and dirt on the glue...

Do keep in mind that this seal isn't a &quot;seal&quot;, but just a felt piece to keep
debris out. The sunroof is designed to collect small amounts of water and drain
them out of the bus via 4 drains (2 front, 2 aft)

Enjoy!

&gt; to&quot; book offers nothing in the means of installing a new one. Can anyone help
&gt; me with an illustrated look at how to install the felt seal for my 76 bus
&gt; sliding sunroof????
