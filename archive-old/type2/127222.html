Subject: RE: [T2] Fixing Type IV Head Leaks

Tim,

There are MANY factors that go into the condition we call &quot;Head leakage&quot;.
Many of these are misunderstood and simply overlooked until you get as deep
as we are into these engines like we are and try to make 50+ HP per
cylinder.

The Type IV faced a challenge right off the designers drafting desk... Below
I will go over the most important ones and will sum it all up with a few
tricks that we use to seal heads off with no problems.

First off, keep in mind that proper engine temperatures play a huge role in
head leaks. Engines that run hotter suffer from higher degrees of expansion
and contraction. This expansion and contraction will do their best to warp
heads and cylinders and START a small leak. When the leak starts it doesn't
take long to grow into a hissing, popping sound that eventually means a
burnt cylinder or head or both. 

Keeping your engine at operating temperatures and head leaks won't be near
as much of an issue. Even VWs engineering flaws aren't too bad unless the
engine is overheated.

Dis-similar materials
You have a full does of them with a TIV engine, and they cause more issues
than anything else! The selection of materials that VW chose was all over
the place, and they tried to make them as compatible as possible. When you
have a die cast ALUMINUM engine case, cast iron cylinders, sand cast
ALUMINUM cylinder heads and sometimes (hopefully not) a head gasket there
are a lot of things growing at way different rates. This is why when one
installs an aluminum cylinder (see www.lnengineering_dot_com) all the normal
problems go away- its all in the expansion rates and the way its all
designed to work. When other things enter into the problem, its gets really
tricky.


Offset head stud pattern 
The engineers designed the engine with an offset, non square bore spacing
that places the lower, outside head stud on each bore &quot;out of square&quot; ..
This really complicates things as this stud effects the tension and torque
that the cylinder head clamps onto the cylinder. This in its self is not a
huge deal, but when placed with the other deficiencies with the engine made
the challenge of correcting it difficult, as it requires a multitude of
procedures to correct.. After other modifications this bit of
mis-engineering is not as big of a player in head leaks.. However- The
bigger the bore size you go with, the more apparent these problems become
and the harder they are to whip. This can be noted simply by the fact that
the 1.7 engines had much better success with sealing off the heads, and
seldom ever have these issues. Their small 90mm bore 

Unequal head stud lengths (this is where you can see Porsche didn't design
this engine)

Look at even the earliest Porsche 356 engines, the 547 4 Cam Carrera and all
the way up to the 911 and even piston engined aircooled aircraft engines-
you will see a trend. All these engines had all head studs made the same
length! The cylinder heads were designed to accommodate this so the studs
would all expand and contract at like rates due to the same amount of
elasticity and stretch. The VW TI and TIV do NOT incorporate this, and
that's one reason why we have head leakage. The upper studs are shorter than
the lower and expand less! Also the upper studs are in the cooling air
charge on the upper side of the plenums and are cooled more than the lowers,
this also worsens the issue by keeping those studs not as expanded also. I
have went so far as to use sleeves to insulate these studs from the cooling
air trying to lessen these effects. There is nothing we can easily do to
remedy this issue, it just adds a challenge to the equation and makes the
offset bore spacing more of an issue. With proper procedures we can still
have good results even with this design flaw that was undoubtedly a corner
that was cut by VW to keep costs down. 

Stud material (damn its wild stuff)

Who knows what this stuff is, but it is definitely odd! Some of the worst
head leaks I have seen were on engines with aftermarket head studs that have
weird expansion. VW did their homework on these studs and produced something
that is damn near indestructible! When you break one off the only thing that
will touch it is a cobalt tipped ball nose end mill, and even that has a
tough time. 

When the stud material is changed the effects of the off center cylinder
head pattern, and the unequal lengths of top and bottom studs are multiplied
and made much worse than ever before.

As with any stud, if these studs do not expand correctly they exert MORE
CLAMPING PRESSURE on the cylinder heads and do so in an uneven method. This
warps the head and causes leaks.. The hotter the engine gets the worse it
becomes! Stick with stock studs or a set of specially engineered studs from
www.lnengineering_dot_com and you'll have the best chances of success.


Cylinder head gaskets (what a mistake by vw!)

Perhaps my second biggest gripe with VW was these damn gaskets!! They are
comprised of 3 layers of aluminum of .008 thickness and then pressed
together and formed into a gasket. In the early 80s VW realized their
problems and sent out a bulletin stating that these gaskets should be
removed, and the compression ratio adjusted with a .030 cylinder bas shim at
the first rebuild. 

These shims are soft and thin and have a tendency to shrink with heat. As
soon as they shrink a small leak is started, and then the soft material
blows out making a huge leak. These gaskets kill TIV engines, and I never
reuse them. We always remove the gaskets and do our procedures to seal the
heads off. We use no gasket of any type and never have leaks. Our procedures
promote a &quot;Carbon seal&quot; between the cylinder and head and require some
machine work to complete. 

ONCE AGAIN, THESE ISSUES ARE ALL MADE WORSE BY OVERHEATING THE ENGINE! MOST
OVERHEATING IS DUE TO POOR ENGINE CONFIGURATION BUT MORE SO BY
TUNING!!!!!!!!

How to remedy these issues

Its really not that hard. I will start with parts selection and go further
into the procedures that we do to keep heads sealed off in our applications.

Parts-

Cylinders
Since you cannot change the composition of your case or cylinder heads, you
must make do with what you can. The easiet part to change is the cylinders
and many people do. Most cases they go the wrong way and cheap out! The OEM
cylinders have different cast iron composition than the aftermarket kits and
they wear less, warp less and create leaks because they are really crappy
made. Their machine work is not flat, especially on their sealing surfaces.
This is even more true with big bore kits of around 96mm. The 96s we use in
our best engines use a VW OEM cylinder that has been re-bored to 96mm, and
then plateau finished with our skirt clearance for the application. They
also get both ends resurfaced and are indicated in the bed of a mill to
check for flatness. If you replace your cylinders use OEM Mahle's or step up
to a set of LN engineering Nickies.  Stepping up to the Nickies is a big
step, but they are worth every dime they cost! Using Mexican made and
Chinese made cylinders is the first big &quot;no -No&quot; one can make.

Head studs
This one is easy, keep them stock or if you go to Nickies, use the ones that
were designed in the kit. No variations and no questions! VW knew what they
were doing on stud material for the stock arrangement, just like the
engineers did that designed the Nickies.

Head gaskets
Throw the stockers away that come in the gasket set and don't use ANY gasket
between the cylinder/head. It gives ANOTHER expansion rate and point and
starts issues, and makes others worse! This includes copper gaskets, they
also have another different expansion rate and cause issues- they are
advertised to be the best thing since sliced bread, but they are not for a
TIV.

Cylinder base shims
Measure them closely. If they vary .002 or more don't use them on the same
side of the engine as they create uneven cylinder heights and create leaks
just like anything else. When possible use the VW factory shims to get the
proper deck height. If they say &quot;Taiwan&quot; on them, get a mike and start
measuring!

Machine work

This separates the &quot;men from the boys&quot; fellows! Almost all the issues that
VW created can be killed with the right machining procedures and checks.
Here I will go over them.

cylinders
 
Before assembling your engine, use valve lapping compound on the base of the
cylinder where it seals into case. I prefer to use the very fine clover
brand. Rotate the cylinder into the case and then clean off the compound.
Look for a very fine grey line to be consistent both on the case register
and the cylinder. This will tell you if the base of your cylinder is true or
warped and will also check the case register at the same time. Check each
cylinder in its own register and marke them for future assembly in their
respective positions. If the cylinder is warped all 4 will need to be
chucked into a lathe and resurfaced. If the case is not flat it will need to
be surfaced as well. Either of these can cause a problem and will be checked
by a builder that has attention to detail.

The sealing surface of the cylinder into the head is the most important area
of concern with the cylinder. Over time this surface will warp with heat,
and on new cylinders sometimes they are warped out of the box. Grab some
Dykem machininst dye (either blue or red) and a piece of 400 grit sandpaper.
You will also need a piece of glass or a mirror, or a &quot;lapping table&quot; to
create a totally flat surface to be the basis of your checks.

Using the flat surface and the 400 grit sandpaper as a tool, coat the head
sealing surfaces of the cylinder with dye and allow it to dry. Hold the
cylinder perfectly flat and move it across the sandpaper evenly and firmly,
do this two times and then lift up the cylinder and look for dye remaining.
If dye remains in some areas those areas are low and the cylinder is warped
or has suffered from erosion. It is sometimes possible to complete this
procedure a few times and remove the high spots, but you run risk of making
uneven cylinder decks and creating a leak due to uneven sealing of the head.

The machinist way of checking this is to indicate the cylinder into the bed
of a mill and use a indicator to rotate across the top of the cylinder and
show inaccuracies in increments of .0005&quot; This is what I do and it takes
forever, but works well. We end up with a solid days work into a set of
cylinder for many of our engines. (Nickies don't need any of this, they are
CNC machined and are spot on) 

If your cylinders suffer from this, take them to a machine shop and have
them turned .005 on all 4 and even out the cylinder heights at the same
time.

Cylinder heads I swear I'm almost done
We machine a step in the top of our cylinder heads that is the same OD as
the cylinder as well as the same ID as the cylinder. Basically the cylinder
sits on top of this step and when we design the engine this step is used
instead of &quot;Deck height&quot; to create our CR settings. Most steps are .060 deep
and create a .060 deck height when the cylinder is set very closely at
&quot;ZERO&quot; deck. We sometimes add a tad bit of room for error and give a
cylinder deck height of .005.

By doing this is promotes strength under the cylinder as well as a &quot;Carbon
seal&quot; to start at the head/cylinder mating point. This also increases
efficiency and burn rates and makes more power as well as sealing things of
well. The key is a proper combination and having the proper chamber volume
for your bore and stroke and desired target static compression ratio.

I cannot really explain this process, but I will have pictures of it up when
I re do my site in the next couple of months. This step is the trickiest and
most important key to keeping things sealed off!

Conclusion:
Once again, keep your engine at operating temperature and do not overheat it
and you may never see issues with head sealing. Use good parts to do the job
and couple them with a bit of attention to detail during assembly.. and last
but not least really look at the cylinder and head design and try to figure
it out in your own mind as you assemble the engine.

I hope this explanation of these issues has helped you to understand how to
&quot;fix&quot; the issues and how to prevent them. I hope I was able to word it so it
could be understood by those who don't do this everyday.

Now you see one reason why what we do seldom breaks, doesn't leak and
benefits from efficiency. (some people think I charge too much, now you see
why this isn't a cheap process)

I wish you luck and happy days of driving- keeping your combustion where it
belongs- In the chamber making power
