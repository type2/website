Subject: Re: [T2] broken head stud on new rebuild

Matt,

I've never heard of a head stud breaking like that, just maybe never
happened to anyone I know...

Did the studs come with the engine or were they aftermarket?

Bottom line(if it was me), drop the engine back out and retorque...no way
around it.&lt;sigh&gt;

You should only need to disassemble enough to be able to get to that side
to do it though.  Some on the list might insist that you loosen up
everything on that side, but I probably would not.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Executive summary: SONOFABITCH!
&gt; 
&gt; Situation: New stock 1600 &quot;rebuild&quot; using mostly new parts
&gt; including new case, p/c, crank, etc. Did the 20 minute run-in
&gt; procedure per Wilson, no apparant problem. Oil pressure and temp
&gt; were monitored the entire time and were good.
&gt; 
&gt; Let it cool down overnight and went to adjust the valves before
&gt; hitting the road. To my horror, one of the lower head studs had
&gt; broken off near the nut. I was able to get it out without pulling
&gt; the head, so theoretically I can replace it and be back in business.
&gt; But do I dare?
&gt; 
&gt; I was very careful about torquing the heads. I followed the
&gt; Bentley procedure, torquing in stages and even alternating heads
&gt; to avoid uneven stress on the case. Unless my new torque wrench
&gt; is horribly off, I did not exceed the spec torque.
&gt; 
&gt; Does one occasionally get a bad stud that breaks the first time the
&gt; engine
&gt; comes up to operating temp? If so does one freak out and tear the thing
&gt; back to the longblock stage? Or does one replace it and go? &quot;Keep on
&gt; coming or stand and wait, with the sun so dark and the hour so late?&quot;
