Subject: Re: [T2] Where's The Bathroom

I told the guy to open the door the next time we stopped and to look for the 
brown and green toilet in the grass. They all got a big laugh out of that 
one.

It was dubbed the happy bus and the trip has been the talk of the office all 
day.

Busses RULE!

&gt; &gt;They spent the entire ride (20 minutes each way) opening all the doors,
&gt; &gt;playing with the sink, and asking where the bathroom is.
&gt;
&gt;I've had the same question. I usually just open up my closet door, pull out
&gt;the plastic jar and say &quot;Here ya go!&quot;
