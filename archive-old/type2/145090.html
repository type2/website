Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Re: Hurricane Wilma

Thanks Karl,

      That really clears things up for me. From what I can tell, sun roof busses are very hard to find because most of them have been converted. Is this a safe assumption?
If he did buy a 68-72, would he be able to easily convert it back to a sunroof bus rather than a Westfalia bus?

Does the sunroof components interfere with anything in the bus? Does it eliminate a lot of potential headroom?


Thanks!!!

Todd

&gt; 
&gt; 68-72 sun roof buses had large metal sun roofs. NOT rag tops.
&gt; The metal panel dropped down and slid back into the area between the outer skin and the inner roof area.
