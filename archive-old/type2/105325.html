Subject: exhaust manifold wrapping 

What is that thing metal wrapping around the exhaust manifold for?

I don't have any on the drivers side, and the passengers side has it, but 
its almost completely rusted through.

Is it important?

I know VW wouldn't have wasted their money putting it on (if not required), 
or would they?


Should I replace it?

I ask because Id like to just cut the rest of it off unless I really need 
it.
