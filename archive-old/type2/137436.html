&lt;&lt; I actually have on LaserDisc, Jimmy Hendrick's entire Woodstock 
performance. 

 In the first 15 minutes of the disc (before they show Jimmy), they're 
showing scenes from the crowd, the field... etc. It shows naked hippies jumping 
around in a pond, and people smoking up. But I also see a LOT of bay-window 
busses. The majority of them of course are the previous gen busses (splitties), but 
I believe I counted 7 bay busses. &gt;&gt;

That's &quot;Jimi&quot;, BTW...And there were actually 8 Bays there, IIRC ... 8-)
