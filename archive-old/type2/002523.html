Subject: 1600 crankshaft choice

Salut les amis!

The sun is back and the bus already got few thousand miles on it since the
beginnig of my VW season.  But the engine is going away and I stat to built
a new engine.  I start from a new case that I've already ordered.  The
engine will be stock 1584cc but I want it reliable, leak free, and long
lasting.

The firs thing I want to choice is the crankshaft.  Is a new counterweighted
cast crank better than a used stock VW crank?  Remember, I want a long
lasting stock engine.  so the counterweighted crank sounds better to lower
internal vibration once everyting well balanced.

Merci
