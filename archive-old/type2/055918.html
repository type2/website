Subject: Re: '77 to '81 Engine swap

&gt; 
&gt; I found a good looking '80-82.5 Westy that needs an engine.  I have a '77 type
&gt; 4 that runs well.  My research shows that the differences between the two
&gt; engines in long block form are the hydraulic valves and the heads with
&gt; breathers on the '80 engine and not on the '77.  Can that stuff be swapped
&gt; over to the '77?  Anything else I need to consider?
&gt; 
I don't know about &quot;heads with breathers&quot; but the heads themselves are
different, most significantly in the shape of the exhaust ports.  

If you want to put the '77 engine into the Vanagon, you will need to
use:
the Vanagon heads
the Vanagon exhaust and heat exchangers
the Vanagon engine tin and engine seal
the Vanagon fan housing
the Vanagon alternator
the Vanagon engine ancillaries (like air filter box, etc.)
the Vanagon oil fill tube
you will have to figure out what to do with the '77 dipstick as in the
Vanagon it's in a different place.  Since you are using the Vanagon fan
housing, you will NOT be able to use the '77 dipstick in its location.
I don't know how you will check the oil.

As Steve Dolan says re Buses, &quot;they're all the same, except that they're
all a little different.&quot;
