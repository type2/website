Subject: Florida contact

Hello All. Firstly, I apologize for this going out on Sunday vs Friday,
but I sent it Friday originally and haven't seen it yet. Probably
something I did wrong, but I saw the notice about mail problems and
thought I'd try again.

I need a contact person for Florida/West Central Florida so I can find
out where the VW Bus meets are located. The person listed with type2 for
Florida doesn't respond to the e-mail I've sent to him (3). Love the
list and you folks, but I want to SEE other busses and folks with my own
eyes and actually touch them (the Busses) with my own hands. I have to
make sure it's all real!!!

Thanks for understanding.
