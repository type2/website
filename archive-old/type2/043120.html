Thanks for your comments, Andre.

I think your response was the turning point in my thought process.
I am NOT going to send to Otto to a rebuild shop.
He does not need it.
He just needs to have those longevity actions performed on him that 
make sense.
I'm going to do a very detailed undercarriage cleanup and paint 
application.
Do the same to the engine compartment.
Make sure he is always clean, and never holds dirt in his corners and 
metal junctions.
Maybe pull the panels and check inner walls.
Keep the glycerin applied to the rubber on a regular basis.
When I drive him, it will be on nice days.
When I park him, I will cover him.
Covering him during parking sessions is an easy job with such a small 
body and smooth lines.

BTW,
I gave away my Buick Park Avenue Ultra the other day to my father.
My only cars, now................ Casper, NewBus, Otto !
At age 53, I'd like to think I will never have to buy another car for 
myself again.
Mary Beth, well, I'll keep her in air conditioned newer models.
We do live in Texas, after all.
102 F today !!
