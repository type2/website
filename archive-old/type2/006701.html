dear list,  I am currently trying to get my '79 westfalia up and running.
It was running like a champ last winter,  then upon my return from a 3 month
work project  the bus having sat for 3 months, the engine is leaking oil.
20,000 miles on rebuild.  The oil seems be coming from between the crankcase
and the fan housing.  I was told this may be the &quot;o&quot; rings that seal the oil
cooler,  or the rubber &quot;booty&quot; that connects the dipstick tube to the oil
filler tube could be the culprits.  I have replaced both of these seals.
Before reinstalling the fan housing we revved the engine for a few minutes
at low and high RPMs to try and detect any leak.  NO leaks visible.  SO now
the test drive has produced dripping again.  All over the exhaust, the
beautiful feeling of pulling up to a stop sign of the highway, with blue
smoke drifting all about.   PERHAPS the oil is residual from the pre-fix
leak,  and needs to be burned off still.  THe reading on the dipstick did
not change ( i made sure to take my first reading after the engine got warm,
then took her for a 40 mile drive, upon returning much smoke from oil on
exhaust, but the same reading on stick).   There is oil all over the fan
housing visible when opening the engine door,  sprayed all over by the fan.
    SO my question is if not the oil cooler seals, the dipstick &quot;booty&quot;, or
the oil cooler (we watched it as we ran the engine NO leak visible), what
could be causing a leak at the back end of the engine?  This is a recent and
sudden development.  No leaks or OIL anywhere prior to this
development......HHHMMMMMM          thanks tom
