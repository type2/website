After installing my GORGEOUS new stereo.....I am having trouble...
....in the past two days I have found that my DIGITAL/QUARTZ clock seems to
be losing about 5 minutes every hour.
Now I did my science homework in my day, and as far as I know this isn't
scientifically possible, unless of course type 2's exist in a parallel
universe etc. etc. etc. or someone has used something other that quartz to
run this display
Any ideas
