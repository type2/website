&gt; Of the four warning lights only the highbeam indicator had (what appeared to

&gt; indicator light opening perfectly and had a small hole in the center.  The
&gt; net effect was that, when the high beams were on, the &quot;blinder&quot; would allow
&gt; only a small circle of light to show on the blue lens.

The other lights have to be seen in daylight and are normally out.  You
want to know _right away_ if they come on.  The highbeam indicator is
only used at night and you don't want it glaring brightly at the driver.
