Subject: RE: [T2] Westphalia table
Date: Tue, 26 Jun 2001 08:35:15 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Does anybody have the table that attaches to the side of the ice box and
covers the sink that they want to sell? I have a 73 westfalia that needs
this sink cover table. 

Also, anybody know a good source for buying tents for the westfalia campers
that look like the originals? I have seen new tents with many designs, but I
am interested in something that looks original.

Thanks,
Corbett
