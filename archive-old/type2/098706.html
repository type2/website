Subject: Re: [T2] 4sale: Advwagen step&amp; deluxe trim (again)

hey guys, this thing would work on a 70 westy, wouldnt it? my 3 year old
daughter has a hard time climbing in the bus and i thought this would
help her. and how hard are they to install?

thanks everyone,
chris
70 westy (may not have much warmth but i LOVE it!)
