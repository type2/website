&gt; Hi all,
&gt; OK, after many helpful list responses and calling around to my local shop
&gt; and the tire companies, it looks like my main choices are thus:
&gt; 
&gt; Michelin Agilis61 in 185R14 at about $120/tire.
&gt; 
&gt; Continental CR21 reinforced (load range C) in 185R14 at about $80/tire.
&gt; 
&gt; Yokohama Y356 in 185R14, price unknown (anybody want to let me know?)
&gt; 
&gt; Kumho Commercial A/S 852 in 185R14C load range D, price unknown.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to be getting 2 tires.  Since the MX that I have on my van is out
&gt; of production and I don't want to mix tread patterns, I'm going to replace
&gt; my slashed tire with a new one and then put another new one on the other
&gt; side, making the leftover MX my spare tire since my spare tire is a
&gt; different size and barely holds air (wouldn't drive on it except in an
&gt; emergency!)
&gt; As it is I'm very strongly leaning toward the Michelin but the price on that
&gt; Continental is looking pretty decent.  Is the Michelin really $40 better?
&gt; 
&gt; I know Michelin makes great tires but I've never had Continental tires
&gt; before on anything.
&gt; 
&gt; The Yokohama has also gotten pretty good reviews on the list.  I seem to
&gt; recall from back in the day that the Y356 was a highway-rib tire but those
&gt; listmembers who have them tell me they are great in snow and rain.  Anyone
&gt; have an approximate price?
&gt; 
&gt; I got one suggestion for the Kumho though I must admit I am a little leery
&gt; of these South Korean tires, even though I have heard some good things.  Kia
&gt; and Daewoo have for me put a bad spin on all South Korean products :-)
&gt; Anyone have a price for these?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm pretty much going to go with either the Michelin or the Continental
&gt; unless someone can make a really really strong case for the Yoko or the
&gt; Kumho.  I'd love to hear of anyone's experience with the Continental
&gt; especially, since no one mentioned them to me aside from Karl.  I had
&gt; Yokohama tires on a Mercedes I once had and they seemed pretty good but they
&gt; were passenger car tires, and that's another world :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for all your help, folks.  Vandals suck!
