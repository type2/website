&gt; I'd like to extend an invitation to you one and all to
&gt; come and participate in a new website dedicated to
&gt; building an international VW community on the web.
&gt;
&gt; We just opened the site on 12 April, 1999.
&gt;
&gt; It's a members only site - BUT - membership is free!
&gt; [...]

&gt; Our site is designed to be a user-friendly one-stop
&gt; site for VW lovers.
&gt;
&gt; Come by and see us at http://www.bluebus_dot_org/
&gt;

How about making sure the web site works before asking all of us to drop by.
I could not sign up, log in or other wise access the site.  I received an
acknowlegement with no text in the body.  I tried the email link to the
webmaster as instructed when problems are encountered and received the
following:

   ----- Transcript of session follows -----
... while talking to server12.hypermart_dot_net.:
&gt;&gt;&gt; RCPT To:&lt;webmaster_at_bluebus_dot_org&gt;
&lt;&lt;&lt; 553 sorry, that domain isn't in my list of allowed rcpthosts (#5.7.1)
550 &lt;webmaster_at_bluebus_dot_org&gt;... User unknown

Looks like a little testing is required before your Grand Opening.

BTW, what's up with the registration (members only) when you will take anyone
in as a member?  It would be nice since there seems to be no criteria for
membership other than agreement with your terms, that you allow immediate
access to the site.  Otherwise, why bother coming back to try again.

Just my 2cents plus some change.

For the list.  I'm sorry for the bandwidth, but previous attempts to contact
this org directly were bounced and since the original was posted on the list,
I figured that this post may get to the originator and it would serve to
notify others not to waste their time until they get the bugs worked out.
(hmmm... bugs at a bus site)
