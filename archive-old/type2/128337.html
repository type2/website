&gt; Last night for the first time since I bought my bus last spring, I had
&gt; occasion to use the high-beams. Lo and behold, my dash lights all came
&gt; on when the high-beams were on. Since buying the van, I assumed that the
&gt; bulbs were shot and hand not been replaced. Now I know that to not be
&gt; the case, but I am trying to figure out what's up. Has anyone else
&gt; encountered this, or have any ideas on how to fix it?

Just from looking at the wiring diagram I would bet the problem was in the
headlight switch.  This is the only common contact point for the
headlights and the instrument lights.  Download the appropriate wiring
diagram for your year from the library and check that the wires to the
switch match those on the diagram.

OOK!
