Subject: Friday Topic: Bondo ain't so bad
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello list,

Well it is Friday and I wanted to mention something
that has been bothering me a little bit. i am not
trying to start any arguments or conflicts of opinion.

I worked at my grandfather's body shop for 4 years
helping out, and doing a little bit of everything. I
am in no way a pro but I worked closely with one. One
thing that I think gets a bad rap is Bondo. When Bondo
and other like fillers are used properly, the repair
is permanent and should not pop off, crack or cause
rust.

The problem is people who don't know how to use Bondo
experiment and use &quot;Bondo&quot; in ways it shouldn't be.
Bondo and other like fillers should not be used to
plug holes, hold pieces of metal together, fill dents
or take the place of metal in most any situation.
Bondo works best when applied to rough, bare, CLEAN
metal. It will stick to paint but It works best on
bare non-rusted metal.

Bondo Glass and other fiberglass products work more as
a filler and have some strength due to the fiberglass
strands. This can be used on welded seams, over small
gouges, punctures, or drilled holes in metal. It does
not absorb water like bondo does.Bondo should be used
to smooth out Fixed parts. 

The only time bondo should fail is in the event of
major trauma to the metal or filler such as a fire or
wreck. If the filler was used like it should, then it
will not compromise the safety or the integrity of the
sheet metal.

On many ocassions, I have seen repairs to sheet metal
using one of these plastic fillers that were at least
10-15 years old. The repairs were done so well that we
didn't see them until we striped the paint off. I have
also seen what misused Bondo can do.

I guess what I am trying to say is that Bondo and
other non metal fillers can be used with great success
when used properly. That is my very long $0.02 worth.

Sorry for the rambling,

David Kelly
