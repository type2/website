Subject: dumb thing happened this morning

so last night, I changed the engine and tranny oil
adjusted the alt belt and brakes in my &quot;new&quot; 77 westy,
drove home 15 miles, started it up, drove to a Mobil
gas station 1/4 mile away from work to get coffee, got
the coffee and ... the friggin bus wont start. here I
am checking spark, laying on the ground, dont here the
fuel pump going, dont see any fuel in the filter. the
fuel gauge read 1/2 tank, what the hell lets put a
gallon in it, 10 minutes later no good, a little
intake cleaner, almost start, one more gallon, it
starts. $18 more of gas, now I know the fuel gauge
doesnt work. Aaaack!
