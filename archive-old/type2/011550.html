Subject: 1.8 Ltr. Motor: Free to good home (North Virginia)

I've got an extra 1.8 liter bus motor to give away in
Arlington Virginia.  I got the motor from Pat Flynn
when I bought my '76 from him.  It is sitting in my
second floor storage bin and I need the room because
we've got a baby on the way.  The motor &quot;ran when
parked&quot; according to the guy that Pat got the motor
from.  My storage bin is just off of Hwy 395, about 15
miles from the Bug In, so it would be easy to pick it
up.

The motor has tin, Fuel injection pieces, etc., (no
heater boxes) but I mangled some of the tin pulling
the thermostat, and some of the FI pieces are kind of
rough, so I would consider the motor a long block.

If you want the motor, please e-mail me, or better
yet, call me at 703-465-0197

(Also, my brother just donated his '80 vanagon to
outreach_dot_org in NYC this morning, so if anyone is
looking for one, check with them.
