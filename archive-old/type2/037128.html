Hi Daniel,

My name is Willem Bron, I am dutch and live in Sweden. I own a 74 Panel
truck converted to camper...
I drive on LPG (liquified petroleum gas)! Have a 60 liter tank and with the
normal 55 liter gas...
The milage is around 15.5 l on 100km. I guess that's around  15.5 mpg. On
fuel I drive around the 19-20 mpg. I have carburators.
In Holland 35 % of all cars has a lpg installation.
If u wanna know more about this look at www.autogas.nl (it's also in
english)
My liquid gas is evaporated in my exhaust. But this is now not anymore
admitted, just because of new legislation. It works perfect.
But driving on lpg gives u less power, u can definetly feel it when
accelerating hard...
So from fuel to lpg: u lose performance and milage but because in Europe lpg
is so cheap and fuel so expensive, u win always. I guess that's not the
situation in the States! Because fuels is soooo cheap!!!
And it's environmenatlly more friendly!!!
I fu wanna know more feel free to ask me

&gt; Hello,
&gt; This is a serious and timely question to put on this list, especially when
&gt; gas prices are skyrocketing as they are these days.  Is there anyone out
&gt; there who has had experience with a T2 that has been converted to run on
&gt; propane or other natural gas?  What does the conversion entail?  Is the
&gt; mileage better or worse?  Is it very cost prohibitive to make the
&gt; conversion?  Any warnings or cautions I should be aware of?  I was just
&gt; thinking that since propane in Oregon seems to be about $1.05 instead of
&gt; $1.60 a gallon, this might be something to consider in the long run.
&gt; Or, and this might be pushing it, how about a hybrid (gas, electric), pure
&gt; electric, or fuel cell set up?  Any thoughts?  What ever happened to that
&gt; holy-grail of a 100 MPG carbeurator I heard about years ago?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
