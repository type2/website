William,
Definately check your distributor advance and make sure that you have
the correct distributor for your year engine.  If you have the wrong
distributor, you'll be getting a mechanical advance that's possibly too
high..

&gt; Thank you for your comments on top end speed for the type 4 type 2. The
&gt; mention of operating temperature is good. My question was originally posed
&gt; from the standpoint of exceeding the mechanical limitations. But the thought
&gt; of dropped seats doesn't enthrall me, either.
&gt; 
&gt; I live in the San Francisco Bay area. On a warm day (as today was) at highway
&gt; speed (55 - 75 mph), full or nearly full throttle and any load results in
&gt; knocking (pre-detonation). My initial solution was to check the timing (which
&gt; I had originally set at 7 degrees BTDC). After making sure the dwell was in
&gt; tolerance, I reset the timing to 5 degrees advanced which alleviated the
&gt; problem some, but not enough. As this is a relatively low-compression engine,
&gt; I had been running 87 octane. I changed to mid-grade and that helped a little.
&gt; Still on warm days like today I have to run at reduced power to avoid
&gt; knocking. An underpowered vehicle at reduced power is no fun! But I don't want
&gt; to thrash my engine, either.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem only seems to occur at highway speeds (and rpm's). Perhaps the
&gt; distributor is over-advancing....
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose I could go up to premium gas, but I don't really think I should have
&gt; to (...not to mention that mid-grade has already hit the $2.00 mark around
&gt; here and premium is even more.)
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?

&gt; &gt; I think 75 is the top I would go. I usually drive my '76 auto at 70 on the
&gt; &gt; freeway, but it tends to get too hot at that speed (you DO have an oil temp
&gt; &gt; right? If not GET ONE! Cheapest insurance you can get). On a war day I have
&gt; &gt; to drive 65 or so, and that's WITH an external oil cooler and fan on it.
