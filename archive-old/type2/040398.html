Greetings

With heads off and one needing replacement due to cracks around exhaust valves, what should I look for to determine whether the cylinders and pistons need work? Compression is all within range on all cylinders. Is there some kind of visual and/or feelergauge test whereby I can determine whether to replace or rebuild pistons and cylinders? Also should I replace the uncracked head to match the other one, or should I only have a valve job done on it to match the rebuilt one I plan on? I assume both heads need to have valve jobs done at the same time, is this correct? Thanks for any words of advice! 

peace-
