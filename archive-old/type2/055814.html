Subject: MIG Argon choice (Re: welding?)

This is a very delayed reaction to the post about my MIG welder, but I do not
always have online access.. I went with the more expensive agron as opposed to
CO2 because it allowed me to get slightly more versatile performance out of a
smaller MIG.  When using argon I can use a lighter power setting than required
for CO2.  This means that i can use metal thicknesses of up to 2.5 mm with
argon and only up to 2 mm with CO2.  These figures are for the solid steel
wire and not the &quot;innershield&quot; type.  With the innershield, gas is not
nessecary because it produces its own shielding gas as it feeds through the
tip within the arc.  With this my MIG, the Lincoln SP 125 Plus, supposedly can
handle up to 8 mm metals.  Using the innershield wire, or any other wire with
a .030 or .035 thickness for that matter, does require the purchase of an
appropriate liner and tip.  
Hope this helps!
