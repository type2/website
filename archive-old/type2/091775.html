Subject: Re: [T2] Waxing philosophical (was: '80 alternator questions)

I see that many times where i work. customer will bring in a car 
running so bad you would  swear  something was broke.  Tech runs codes 
and then does the visual inspection.  many many times it is  an air  
cleaner that is  so clogged the engine shouldnt be running and oil 
filters and plugs just as bad.  &quot;I'm much  to busy to take cars in all  
the time for the stupid stuff&quot; is a common statement.  it should be 
&quot;I'm much to stupid  to own a car&quot;  I should post the picture from the 
customer  last  week that came in complaining  of noisy brakes for 
&quot;about a week&quot;.  The rotor was  cut all the way through  and in two 
pieces. About a  week???  He  needed the  car for too many things to 
get it checked.
