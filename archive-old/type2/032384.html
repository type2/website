Terri,

Unfortunately I know how you feel. I have been looking for a decent passenger bus for some time now. I have followed numerous leads and answered dozens of ads that claimed that the bus was &quot;rust-free&quot;,&quot;straight&quot;,&quot;clean&quot;,&quot;all original&quot; etc etc etc, ad nauseum. In all cases it was bull$hit. I have owned a straight rustfree bus and know the difference! Most folks idea of a resto invloves bondo fiberglass, pop rivets, expoying replacement panels over rusty ones blab blah blah.

Regarding motors, unless someone has a DETAILED receipt for parts and machine work and I can follow up on it with the mechanic, I dont put much into the &quot;fresh rebuild.&quot; I have a decent spare motor so I really don't care. It is amazing how many &quot;fresh rebuilds&quot; leak like a runny nose. 

Just this week I received an email from a seller. I had to ask twice for info on the &quot;rebuild&quot; and was told that a &quot;new case&quot; and &quot;new heads&quot; were used in a type4 rebuild. Perhaps this is true but.......The seller went on to say that the push rods were leaking. ??????? Rebuild???????? Never could get out of him who the rebuilder was, where the machine work was done and what was the source of parts. It is hard to be enthusiastic when you can't get a straight answer from a seller. 


I've run across lots of ads with &quot;new motor with (enter a low number of miles here) &quot; These buses invariably are in the $3000 to $3500 price range if it is a 72up bus. I have come to the conclusion that they had a bus that was ok at best, blew the motor, paid a lot more for a rebuild then they expected and decided it was time to get out so they add the price of the rebuild to whatever else they have in the bus and expect to get it all back out. 

As for paint, bring a magnet. Paint was put on by VW to &quot;protect&quot; the metal and make it pretty. A repsray is usually hiding something especially one of those cheap resprays where they paint the window seals, door seals , lights and wheel wells. Bring a magnet!
