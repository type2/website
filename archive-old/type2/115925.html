Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temp sender/sump plate

on 9/4/03 14:04, Bob Forrester related:
 
&gt; I'm not sure how it is possible that the sump plate sender reads ~15 degrees
&gt; lower than a dipstick one since my sump plate sender sits about 1/2 inch
&gt; away from the end of my dipstick on my engine.

this is confusion caused by type 1 versus type IV. the sump plate on a t1 is
in the middle of the sump proper, away from the dipstick. on a t4, what is
commonly referred to as the sump plate (also called &quot;inspection plate&quot;) is
right in the well where the dipstick also lives.

a trivial note: it seems this inspection plate has a purpose other than
holding the 914 sender - in europe you find t4 motors with factory installed
&quot;block heaters&quot; which replace this plate. i have never laid eyes on one, and
i am surprised we never had them here in the great white north, but in
nordic europe they are common, i have been told.
