Subject: Re: Regular vs Premium...it's getting smelly in here;-)

I use three tanks of 87 octane, then find me an Amoco Station and run a
tankful of Gold label, 93 octane, through the Mothership.   At least thats
what I try to do.  Right now I have 177,000 miles on the original engine,
and she starts clean without any prompting or priming.

In the morning I go out, step into the pilots seat, buckle up, turn the
key, and push the button.  On the third to fifth roll she fires up.  After
5-7 seconds of cold idle pings rattle and bumps (the noise every VW driver
should listen to daily without fail) she steadies herself and eases out to
that oh so familiar aircooled growl.  (You know the sound!  Reminds me of
Mutley, Dick Dasterdly's dog laughing when old Dick screwed up bad enough
to get smushed by something, in his efforts to acost Pretty Penelope
Pitstop.)

I like the fact that I am maintaining her as best I know how, or can glean
from this list.

I have also been known to pour a quart of Marvel Mystery Oil in the tank
every once in a while.  I started doing that with my cars years ago when I
owned a Vega GT.  I got 105,000 out of it.  In a Vega that was amazing!  : )

Try the white gas trick...it might work for you to.  I don't know about
carbs but it apparently does injectors a bit of good.

Just my opinion of course,

Charlie Ford
