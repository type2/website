Subject: Case stud removal

Hi gang,

I've been trying to remove the case studs from a 79 T2 case and 3 of them
refuse to budge.  I've found a couple of messages on the subject in the
archives, but nothing I haven't already tried.

I've tried the double jam nut procedure, getting the case warm (keeping it
inside the house AND heating it with propane, using vise grips and a wrench
at the same time, soaking with liquid wrench.

Does anyone know where I can get a stud remover tool?  How do machine shops
remove stuck case studs?

Thanks for your help,
