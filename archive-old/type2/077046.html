Subject: do i have the correct camshaft?

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

rebuilt type2 1975 1.8L

here's the problem: got everything together and it ran quite well but =
had no guts so i checked and compression was 80 all the way around... =
rebuilt heads, new mahle p&amp;c's... hmmm...

the only thing i can guess is that my cam is wrong (it was meshed with =
the crankshaft just fine), put the wrong size shims under the cylinders, =
or gaskets btwn cylinders and heads, or my valves aren't making a good =
seal... but to start i thought i should make sure the cam is correct:

here's the number for the cam:
021-109-11-b-19H -3

that's on the gear... on the shaft itself i find, in between the lobes, =
from the gear back:
F7
C1
CWC

does this mean anything to anyone? incidentally, my machinist ordered me =
regular bearings and such and said that nothing needed to be oversized =
or reground or anything when i got the stuff back...

any ideas?

thanks!
