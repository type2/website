Subject: Re: heater box question

Back in about 1997 several Vanagon list members, myself included, took
advantage of a free offer by VWoA to replace the heat exchangers, flapper
boxes and accordian tubes on their buses. VWoA sent technicians to various
locales to install the new heater hardware.

The program had to do with asbestos in these parts. VW was apparently
collecting
samples of used heater hardware from the field for analysis. They were also
possibly trying to cover their butts, by being proactive about the issue, as
it seemed that this program was initiated by VWoA's legal department. The
head of this VWoA program was Yves Le Coz, I think.

I think that the replacement heater boxes,  flappers and accordian tubes
that my bus got were Dansk, made in Denmark.

'79 Bus



&gt; I was recently having lunch with an old friend who had a bus a few years
&gt; ago.  He asked if I had my heater boxes replaced due to asbestos.  He said
&gt; that about 5 years ago he received a notice about asbestos and he
&gt; contacted
&gt; whoever it was that sent the letter and they flew a guy out to Sioux
&gt; Falls,
&gt; trailered his bus, took it to a local dealership and replaced the heater
&gt; boxes - all for no charge.
&gt;
&gt; I was just wondering if anyone else experienced something like this or
