Subject: Re: [T2] The Westphalia Waltz

Named for Westphalia, Texas it is still a well known fiddle tune in Texas. 
It was played by all the Western Swing Bands during that era.

&quot;Cotton Collins, a fiddle player for the Lone Star Playboys, composed a 
&quot;no-name&quot; waltz in 1946. After a dance, local citizens suggested the song be 
titled the &quot;Westphalia Waltz.&quot; It was first recorded by the Lone Star 
Playboys.&quot;

&gt;HI Volks,
&gt;
&gt;Found these song lyrics whilst searching for some music stuff....
&gt;Now I know this is not how you spell Westfalia as in campers,but this
&gt;is how the song title is spelt OK ?...no need to tell me...
&gt;It's a Polish folk song with English translation...and I like their 
&gt;thinking ;)

&gt;
&gt;Anyway,maybe some of you Westy owners might be amused and since there
&gt;is no music provided I don't know what the tune is.However,perhaps it would 
&gt;be
&gt;a good challenge to come up with one around a campfire at a gathering
&gt;of Westies sometime...? I'm sure someone would have an acoustic guitar...
&gt;I'll leave it with you...(sorry I missed Friday)
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
