Subject: WTB:  Engine Lid, '68-71

Fishing for a part here, folks...

&gt;&gt; Engine lid for '68-71 bus, pref. white but will not be choosy.

Mine is awful rusty.  I'd like a new one.

I'll pay a fair price plus shipping to Knoxville, TN.

Parting out a '69 bus?  Got some leftover not-quite-perfect parts from doing
that Concours resto?  I'm interested.  (Also looking for other parts)

Thanks-
