Subject: VW parts

Hi, I was hoping someone could direct me on how to find a home for some T2 parts.  I am not trying to kill anyone with prices just trying to not waste it.  Stuff like the cot that goes over the front seat, several T2 jacks, a box of VW Trends from late 90's to early 2K's.  I live around Charlotte.  I had a pop top and I know that this stuff deserves a home.
   
  Thanks
