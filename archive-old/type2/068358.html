Subject: Aux. batt. in '72...

After recently begining this same project myself, maybe I can shed some 
light on a few things.  But first, a question:What does an aux. batt. run 
on a '72?  I thought that '72s don't have fridges.  Well, the way mine is 
set up so far is: it sits in the left side of the eng. comp. connected to 
a relay on the BACK of the eng. comp. wall(relay keeps batt. charged and 
doesn't let it drain the starting batt.) relay is conneted to the alt., 
and the batt. just runs the frige.  My water pump is connected to the 
main batt.  I'm still trying to get the batt. condition indicator to work
properly.  Well, I must be off, my water pump leaks out of the bottom and 
I'm gonna try to alleviate the problem without buying a new one.
