Loosen the heat exchangers.
This will give the 1/4&quot; you need.
And a good excuse to have another beer :)

hello again,
  just tried to put a quiet pack on my ' 75 FI bus. the box said empi. the
muffler said empi. the extractor said made in china. i never got the muffler
on because the extractor was too short and would not fit. i could get one
side bolted up but then i was a quarter inch short on the other. is this
common or is this just inferior chinese craftsmenship?
