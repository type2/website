Dear Listees,

Can anyone recommend, or does anyone have any experience in installing
auto-retracting shoulder-lap belts for the front seats in a Bay Window
bus (1971).  I am really tired of the belts we have now;  I am forever
banging the latch onto the side of our van--chip, chip, chip!  And the
things are so hard to adjust!
