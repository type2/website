Subject: [T2] Why can't people fix things right?

  Perhaps some of u volks are a bit anal...
  In my '68 i've found evidence kludge fixes,
long-gone CBs, a ham radio, stereos, curtains, heater
blower fans, cooling modifications....

Actually, i like it that way. Every repair is a
archeological dig into the imaginations of the POs.

I only &quot;restore&quot; by accident--ripping out the junk
that doesn't work and putting in more-or-less stock
stuff that does work. 

i hung a Budda pendant on the front mirror. (i think
that's stock.)
