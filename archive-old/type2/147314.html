Ouch.  

I have a suggestion: Parked trucks over here in Germany
often have huge reflective signs on them (I'm not sure
if they're required or anything).  Almost a metre square
in size.  Hard to overlook, even on purpose.  If you
can't find something like that, maybe a traffic sign
or similar?  Anything big, reflective, and bright in
colour.

Or maybe use am LED bicycle tail light.  Switch it on
and off either manually or maybe by a light detector.
The flashing variety uses less battery and catches
more attention.  Use huge D cells instead of the
tiny ones that are in there, and it should last you
a week.  Get rechargeables, and a charger of course.
Whatever.

It should be rather easy to rig up something or other
to increase visibility.

Sure it sucks to have to rig up something like that 
just because people are too bl**dy stupid to look 
where they're going, but having your Buses crashed into
certainly sucks more ...

Or, if there's space, get a good massive junker and
park it so as to protect your Bus.  (Although Murphy
says that the next blind idiot is going to push that
junker into your Bus :-/ -- so be careful.)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
