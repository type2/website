I have a '77 bus with a 2-liter fuel injected engine. I bought the rebuilt engine from Kragen (first mistake!) and installed it 2 years ago. The first 6 months were good, then the valves started tightening up!? and the engine would get hot (tested via the hand method, no temp gauge). Finally, I couldn't drive it over a few miles before it would heat up and seaze. It 'sounds fine'. I removed it yesterday and inspected the heads, they look fine the push rods look brand new. The oil cooler is not plugged. What else can I look for? I am new to this group and new to fixing vans. any suggestions would be appreciated.
