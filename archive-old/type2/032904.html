Subject: Name That Part

Just had a new clutch cable installed in my 73 Westy. On the bottom of the
work order my mechanic says: Needs bell crank at pedal end. I've looked in
Muir, VW Manual and Haynes and they don't list such a part. Does anybody
know what it is, what it does, part #, and where to get one?

TIA

73 Orange Westy
