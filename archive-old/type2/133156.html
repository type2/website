Subject: Re: [T2] Speedo Adjust or calibrate?

Zach,

I've been to the Eureka show, so out of touch for several days.

Here is how I did it on another vw.

Look at your tires and then go look at tirerack for the same tire(or very 
close)...then click on specs and it will tell you how many revoutions
the tire makes per mile.

I then pulled the speedo cable out of the wheel and connected it to
my variable speed drill...it is one that has the small dial in the
trigger that you can set for different rpm's....set it lowest, set the 
drill to rotate backwards(same direction as the tire turns).  Repeat
for faster speeds.  The stock tires on my bus are listed at 833 
revolutions per mile.

I then turned it on and let it run about 10 seconds while I used an 
optical rpm meter to measure the speed of the drill...wrote down the
drill rpm's and the speed shown on the speedometer and the rest was a 
little math.  This covers variations in how lubed the cable is and how 
&quot;off&quot; the speedo is.

You could also just have your wife pace you on a quiet street while
using your hands free cell phone  to talk to each other about the speed.

Cheers, dave

&gt; While driving home from my parents Sunday night with my wife behind in our 98
&gt; Altima, I found I was speeding. Luckinly it was my wife who told me this, not
&gt; some mean policeman. She said that she had to speed up tp about 50-55ish to
&gt; keep up with me in a 40 zone. Only kicker is that my bus said I was doin a
&gt; steady 40.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any way to calibrate or adjust my speedo. I'll have to go out and
&gt; check at lunch, but I'm 99% sure my tires are stock size.
&gt; Thanks
