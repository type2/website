I was thinking about the exact same thing last week, although more for a
noise reduction solution than for heat (don't have the same heating concerns
here in Texas).  I think what would be ideal for both would be something
which isn't just one layer of of fabric, but sort of a quilted blanket type
of thing, so that it has some insulation properties.
