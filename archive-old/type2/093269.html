Subject: Re: [T2] WINDSHIELD


&gt;I have taken note from the type 2 vintage crowd, and I like the idea of 
&gt;using roofing tar for the instalation. You dilute it slightly then put it 
&gt;on the sealing surface. Roofing tar melts in the summer, making it get 
&gt;into more places, and repels water. It wont wear out. Seems awesome to me!
&gt;
&gt;Stops leaks cold.....or so Im told...

Careful with the application though. I had a 1966 Moostang in '86-'88 that 
I could not stop from rusting. It was hell bent on returning to the earth - 
it had been troubled long enough by this world I guess.

We cut out the rear floors that were like Swiss cheese and welded in new 
steel. Then I went back with a wire brush and cleaned the welds and finally 
coated it with TAR - roofing tar.

It sealed out the water but where I did not get it against the metal tight 
enough it collected water and restarted the rusting process.

Works where it is applied right, a mess where it doesn't.

Also I have seen old cars (I had a '49 Chevy p/u) where somebody used the 
TAR and it leeched up out of the seal and on to the body and around the 
glass. Sealed yes, but visible too. May not be an issue with everyone.

NAPA sells urethane in a caulking tube made for sealing glass installations 
and that I will be trying next.

Also any pro glass installer should be able to sell you some too. His price 
was the same as NAPA's. Guess you've just got to decide who you need the 
brownie points with.
