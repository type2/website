&gt; The Bentley gives you the amp hour spec. Put in an Interstate Group 41 for
&gt; great capacity and nationwide warrenty at many sources in many towns.

I ski and have to start that big 2 liter up on some MIGHTY cold mornings
at mountain lodges and high altitudes.. I have a dip stick sump heater,
and twin 1000 amphour batteries, I could probably drive 50 miles on the
starter, but I aint't taking no chances because I can't walk for help.

I've had good results with Exide, although others here disagree
