Subject: Re: A Different Starting Problem

Today my bus decided it didn't want to start any more.  Unfortunately, it
did this at a gas station in a part of town for which I was wearing the
wrong colors.  Remind me to pick up something nice in scarlet...

When I turn on the key, I get the idiot lights, but when I turn it, nothing,
no dimming, no clicking whirring or anything.

try pulling the wires off the ignition switch and crossing them.  If it
starts then- the ignition switch is suspect
