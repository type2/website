&gt;He's speaking about the &quot;flapper&quot; in the AFM.  In my experience, &gt;putting the pedal to the floor on a Volkswagen when starting only &gt;helps when the mixture is too rich since it introduces much more air &gt;into the engine which helps burn the excess fuel.

Ahh yes, I had the wrong flapper. Isn't the 'flooring it' a visious cycle since introducing the air to burn the fuel asks the computer for more gas to burn with the air anyway?

&gt;The cold start system is completely independent of the ECU.  If the
&gt;thermo-time switch senses that it's cold enough it allows current to &gt;flow to the cold start valve when the key is in the &quot;start&quot; &gt;position, opening up the valve and giving the engine that &gt;extra &quot;squirt&quot; of fuel it needs on startup.

Sneaky thermo time switch, then does the cold start valve not ground on the manifold (therefore two prong connection to supply a ground?)
