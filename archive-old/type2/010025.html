&gt; &gt; I had rear end of Westy lifted, and noise was created.  Major rear
end
&gt; &gt; lift, higher than level, so I have an unintended rakish look.

If you go to a doctor and say &quot;It hurts when I do this&quot;, the doctor
will probably reply &quot;Well, don't do that!&quot;

Get the bus back down to the correct ride height before you attempt
further diagnosis.  This means that you will have to adjust _both_
ends of the torsion bars this time! :)

A jacked up rear end will cause you untold grief!
