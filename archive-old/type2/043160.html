Subject: Survey - Emission Test Readings

Woo Hoo!!  I passed emissions in Colorado this morning.  I'm curious to know 
what readings some of the rest of you got on your buses.  So anyone who cares 
to reply, please send responses directly to me OFF-LIST at mikeg_at_pcisys_dot_com and 
I'll post the results later.  Here's what I think I need to know:

Year bus:
Engine type (ie. I or IV or whatever):
Engine size (ie. 1600, 1.7, 2.0, etc.):
Engine year (for those of you with non-original engines):
FI or Carb (and type of carb setup if you know it):
HC PPM at idle:
HC PPM at 2500 rpm:
CO% at idle:
CO% at 2500 rpm:
CO2% at idle:
CO2% at 2500 rpm:

I think that's all the pertinent data - if there is other that I don't list, 
please feel free to include it in your responses.  All this data should be 
printed on the sheet you got at the emissions testing station.  I'll collect 
data until next Thursday and post the results to the list on Friday, July 28.

Thanks
