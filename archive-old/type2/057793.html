Subject: Re: single/double cabs in Europe

&gt; &gt;He said that the Single Cab and Crew Cab pickups were extremely
&gt; &gt;popular in Europe and that you see them all over the place there.
&gt; 
&gt; True, they still are. Mostly used as light trucks
&gt; by contracters, gardeners etc,

You won't find many nice pre 79 single cabs and crew cabs anymore. They
have just been just up or have rusted away in the European climate.
Generally, you will see many Type 2s in England but very few on the
continent.
