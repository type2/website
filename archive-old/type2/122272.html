Subject: Help! &quot;Herky Jerky Syndrome&quot; still prevails after very
  expensive diagnotics

Help,
I just had a &quot;reputable&quot; mechanic diagnose my van for what I assumed to be
finding vacuum leaks and re-adjusting air/fuel mix. He tells me that after
diagnosing ALL day that he pinpoints it as being the AFM box. Then they tried
selling me one from across town for 600 big ones. So, I ordered one on the net
for 1/3 of the cost and towed it bag home thinking a saved myself money.
OK - I received the new RBLT AFM today and started it up for the first time.
What ever the mechanic tweeked, it seemed to have a healthier idle. I began to
think Whalaaaa! Decided to go for a quicky around the block after letting it
first warm up for five minutes. After a 100 feet my PROBLEM started all over
again like nothings been fixed and already 700 bones down the drain for
terrible service and diagnosis.
PROBLEM - the vanagon will jerk like no tomorrow at least in the low gears
when driving down the road like it's flooded. When the accelerator is being
used it will stall and die. Then it usually takes about 3-4 minutes before it
starts up again._dot_usually not wanting to idle for very long, 5 - 10 seconds.

It starts up beautifully in the mornings, until cold start is over. The
mechanic said that all the pressure and vacuum readings were all within decent
specs. Which was his excuse for why it took so long to solve (yeah right) the
problem.
I am suppose to move this monday from Seattle to Southern Oregon and am of
dire help to solve this problem. I need some advice please.
Thanks in advance.
