Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Heat

Electric heat is nice, but DRY!!  At our last campout last weekend, the
humidity was around 20 percent and the temps outside around 25 Friday night.
I have a humidity gauge in my Scamp and I used a Little Buddy propane heater
since my Scamp furnace was not working.  By morning, the humidity was about
60 percent in the trailer, but one of my friends who used his electric
heater was complaining about how dry it was in his bus and how dry his mouth
and nose were.  

I guess it depends on the situation, but out of the 10 bus campouts I went
to this year, only 2 had electricity.  I guess a person should maybe have
one of each type of small heater just in case.

&gt; List, Jim:
&gt; I'm convinced that the safest heat while camping would be an electric heater,
&gt; if
&gt; you can get an electric campsite. I'd think even a 1500watt electric heater
&gt; would keep a small area pretty toasty and add NO moisture or fumes to the mix
&gt; we
&gt; breath. A BIT safer than combustion heaters loose inside the camper, but still
&gt; have to look out for igniting stuff nearby!
&gt; Maybe one day soon I'll duct tape the rust holes shut in my westy and go
&gt; campin!

&gt;&gt; I do recommend you have a fire extinguisher handy and don't do this if
&gt;&gt; you've ever smelled gas fumes inside of your bus. Make sure all of your fuel
&gt;&gt; lines are quite secure (always a good idea!).
