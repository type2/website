Subject: Re: [T2] Suggestion for removing broken cylinder stud

&gt; You can fool around with hot/cold all day, or:
&gt;
&gt; Mig a nut on the broken stud, it becomes...
&gt; ( walla:) a bolt. Sound simple? It's not.
&gt; Penetrate the weld deep into the base of the nut.
&gt; Add penetrating fluid while the stud cools.
&gt; Expansion / contraction breaks the rust grip.
&gt; Repeat as often as necessary, you will
&gt; twist these nuts off until you get it.
&gt;

Sounds like a good suggestion, but I don't have a mig so this will have to be
done by a shop. I have never had much luck with easyouts and given the force
the stud held when I twisted and the amount of penetrating oil that I have
used I think any easyout would just break.

&gt; I hope this wasn't the nice case
&gt;   your photos showed earlier this week.
&gt;
No, this is another case I have. I just got tired of the extra space it
required with the studs, plus as it will sometime go to get aligned bored,
they need to come out anyway.
