Subject: Connecting Rod Removal

Hey list,
I have removed the heads (which are shot), the
cylinders and piston no. 3 (most damaged piston) from
my 1972 engine and I was thought I would remove the
connecting rod to determine whether or not I needed to
split my case.  My question, is it possible to remove
the connecting rods in advance of splitting the case? 
I loosened the two nuts holding the cap to the rod on
that was connected to cylinder number three, and I
can't seem to get the rod loose.  After a prolonged
effort it won't wiggle loose.  Am I wasting my time,
or might I have overlooked something that is
preventing the removal?

On a second note, the walls of the cylinders appear (I
have yet to measure) to be significantly thinner than
those from a 1700 engine shown to me by my local
mechanic.  It looks as though (to my untrained yet
observant eye) that somewhere along the line someone
bored the cylinders to increase power.  It was
explained to me that this process, while adding power,
it enhances the chances that the engine will overheat.
 Has anyone had any direct experience with this?  If
true, I plan on replacing the cylinders and pistons
with cylinders and pistons appropriate for a 1700
engine.  Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Billy Ray
