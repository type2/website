Subject: Bad Coil and Pertronix?

Hi, I have seen mention of this problem in the old archives, but can not
find any answers?

I have a 75 Westy with a 2 L engine, fuel injected.

I just went out and bought a 009 dist and a pertronix ignition system. The
bus ran great in the morning. Parked it, changed the oil and then installed
the distributor with the pertronix ignition in place. Yep, now it wont
start. I checked the coil right away and do not get any spark from the wire
(#4) when grounding it close to the case etc. It seems that the coil is
getting power from the ignition, but can anyone give me a simple reminder of
how the coil should be wired? I got a little frustrated and started playing.
I also re installed the dist and checked the firing order, but nothing. The
starter is turning the engine and I smell fuel, just no spark to fire it.

The coil is a blue Bosh and is not that old (year or so). Is it possible it
just died, or did I fry something else. I had the battery disconnected while
installing. I live in a place where no one carries the coils for the bus,
except for the cheap versions from Auto Zone etc.

Thanks for the help to come.

Dave
