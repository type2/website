Subject: Rear Brake Drums...ARRRRGH

I have a leaky rear wheel cylynder on my 73 bus and I can NOT get the drum
off. I tried tapping the drum with a hammer, to no avail.  The drum will
turn easily.  But it's solidly on the hub (yes I did take out the two 11mm
screws).  I'm frazzled.  Any tricks I should know about?
