Subject: Re: [T2] Parts needed for a Brosol-Solex 30-31 carb


There's another part(or parts) that I would love to find a source for:the 
genuine Solex rebuild kit.  The quality of material and fit is MUCH better 
IMHO than the cookie-cutter FLAPS-marketed kits.  Is there anyone out there 
who has access to these or a similar-quality kit?  (Hello Ron!)  As for the 
parts you're looking for, if RMMW is still breathing, they should have 
them(?).  I have an older catalog, but I recall them having a decent 
selection of carb parts.

&gt;I wonder if anyone on the list may have the 3 parts I need for my Brosol
&gt;30mm carb.
&gt;1) 1 or 2 new accel pump diaphragms- the good red rubber type(these are the
&gt;same ones used on German Solex)
&gt;2) the little black plastic bushing that goes into the throttle plate shaft
&gt;and holds the accel pump rod centred
&gt;3) The little black clip that holds the 2 parts aforementioned together.
&gt;
&gt;Any replies appreciated.
