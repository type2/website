&gt;Someone on the list told me they had mounted round 6&quot;

I had speakers in the front doors.  The only space
for them is down low, where you will kick them.

&gt;Does anyone have pics or a suggestion where to put
&gt;the speakers? I may have to go to surface mounts or
&gt;else cut the door panels.

Last year I didn't have the guts to cut my new door
panels for speakers.  Instead I sheet metal screwed
brackets for miniature speakers to the fresh air
pipes below the dash.  An example of these speakers
can be seen at an internet auction site.
