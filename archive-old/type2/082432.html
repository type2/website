Subject: RE: [T2] engine removal/supporting tranny

&gt; If you find that you have to support the tranny on your Type=20
&gt; 4 Bus, you have
&gt; a serious problem somewhere.  On the Type 4, the tranny is=20
&gt; hung from the
&gt; chassis at the rear by two big bolts.  No tranny support is=20
&gt; needed, and the
&gt; transmission does not move when you remove the engine.
=20

It's not the rear of the tranny that needs support, it's the=20
front (so says Bentley anyway.) My theory was that the engine
and bearer (and the 2 big bolts) held the tranny in place (and
correctly aligned) while the engine is in, and removing the=20
engine puts more of the weight of the tranny on the front mount,=20
which may not be designed for that much pressure?=20

I was just following Bentley's recommendation.  I'd love to skip
that step if it's not needed.  I'm a T2 novice so when I read the
&quot;make sure to support the front of the tranny&quot; part in Bentley, at
first I thought &quot;I never had to do this with a Beetle&quot; but then I had
had visions of my tranny dropping and breaking on the concrete floor
so I just went along with what the book said.
