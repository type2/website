Subject: Bad news and good news

[The first vehicle belongs to a good friend.  I know it's not an aircooled
but it's an electrical problem and ought not to make much difference whether
the engine is wet or dry.  I waited til Friday just in case]

Bad news:  A friend's 84 Westy quit completely on the way to the airport.
Local &quot;repair person&quot; (to use the term loosely) said it was the ignition
switch.  Replaced switch, now she starts and runs.  But now the windshield
wipers don't work.  And the headlights say &quot;bright&quot; but look &quot;normal&quot;, and
using the dimmer switch does nothing.  Advice, please?

Good news:  my 72 bus with the 2 liter and single carb (don't yell at me, I
didn't put them there) finally told me her name.  She will be undergoing an
engine rebuild in the near future, plus a lot of less-major things:  maybe
switch to dual carbs; new discs and pads; fix up the heater system; a little
body work and paint; new front seats.  I'm shooting for June 99 to have her
running and ready, as I'm planning to take her on an August trip from west
KY to Altoona PA, thence to Fargo ND, thence to Argonia KS, and back home.

P'rfesser
72 bus, &quot;Maureen&quot;
