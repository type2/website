Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust studs...

From Nigel A. Skeet

Exhaust manifold stud thread size which fits into the cylinder heads of the 
1972~79 VW Type 2 is :-

M8 x 1.25mm for 1700 engine
M9 x 1.25mm for 1800 engine


You asked

&gt;Well I need to replace a stud from the head to my heater boxes (73 bus)
&gt;Does anyone know what thread pitch this would be??? It has a 13 mm nut on
&gt;it.  I think it is 8mm  but I know there are more numbers and I need to 
&gt;call
