Subject: A new micro?  Don't think so!

------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C21204.94C3BC20

What is this?  A microbus?  I don't think so.  What exactly constitutes t=
his being called a microbus, I mean, other than the marketing.  Early mic=
ros were very much like a true bus of that era.  Engine in back, flat nos=
e, windows on top for scenic cruising.  This one is front engine, bulbous=
 nose, and I do not see the top windows.  Uuuuuuuugggggly!!!!!
So is it the 2 tone paint?  Once again VW is drawing on the old which was=
 once considered a fridge on wheels, and is now a &quot;head turner&quot;, and usin=
g it to sell it's product.
Now I am sure we will see these things at shows with our busses, and when=
 we ask the owner about them, I think we will be seeing some undersides o=
f noses.  Air is not water, and water, not air.  Excluding of course all =
the wasserboxer Vanagons, though in my opinion, that is a van, not a bus.=
  So is this new thing.  Let's face it, it's a mini-van!
