&gt;Ever since I got my type IV engine running it has been going thru alt

&gt;AC, and mixed and matched parts to get the best ones. After consulting
&gt;the archives on belts a feeble light bulb came on in my head. Are some
&gt;of the parts, mainly the fan hub flange different on cars with and
&gt;without AC. My reasoning is this: AC engines have that funky pully
&gt;between the fan and hub which must space  out the fan away from the
&gt;engine some. This would cause some mis-alingment between the fan pully
&gt;and the alt pully. The point is that I did not put the pully in. Anyone
&gt;know about this?

Engines without the pulley came with a spacer that is the same thickness.
You are supposed to have either the spacer or the pulley behind the fan,
although I can't imagine this being enough of a difference to wear your
belt out.  It is possible to put the alternator pulley on the alternator
backwards, in which case it will be farther outboard than it should be.
Maybe this is your problem?
