Subject: Re: Total Seal Rings

Hi TBear!

Sorry I missed your original post about Total Seal rings.  Work has been
seriously insane the last three weeks, so  I've done a really poor job of
'lurking'.  8-D  Just a few thots on TS stuff.  As you prolly already
found out, TS sells a complete ring set; the top compression ring and the
oil control ring look normal.  It's the second compression ring that has
been modified.  It's a two-piece design, a ring-within-a-ring.  (Kinda
like a bicycle innertube and tire)  By rotating the gaps 180 degrees, you
wind up with a 'gapless' ring.  The idea here is to keep all the
combustion byproducts _above_ the piston, minimizing blow-by.  This
increases power to the crankshaft, and reduces contaminants into the oil.
 TS claims that on a small block Chevy this results in almost 5&quot; more
manifold vacuum.  Being a member of the VW Diesel List as well, I first
heard about TS rings a year ago.  The guys there love them, especially on
turbo motor applications.  Having listened to these 'glowing
testimonials' for months, I've decided to try them on a personal project
and a class project (I teach heavy equipment repair at an East Texas
technical college).  The first set is going in my 1.6L VW diesel motor,
the second set is going into a 1967 White diesel multi-fuel engine, and
the third set is for my 1.7L pancake motor.  (Eventually 8-))  Plan on
spending about twice as much for a TS ringset as you would for 'normal'
rings.  The set for a 1.7L pancake motor is #4686 and sells for ~ $90.  A
set for the 1.6L Diesel runs ~ $125.  If you want some first-hand info,
contact Ed at Total Seal, (800) 874-2753.  Sorry for the delay, hope this
helps!
