Subject: Re: [T2] Recharging Gel Cell Batteries

&gt;Gel cell batteries are charged differently than regular batteries and need

Bob, I think it's the other way around.  Regular chargers will overcharge gel cells.  In practice, as long as the regular chargers are not left attached for days on end, they will do just fine.
