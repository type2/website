&gt; Why not do both they are really simple and low in cost. I would also do an
&gt; oil pressure guage if I where you just so you have the full spectrum of
what
&gt; is going on. The oil pressure and temp is one device at least in PADME it
&gt; was. and the cylinder head sensor was only a circular sensing guage that
&gt; mounted between the outerlip of the sparkplug and the external lip of the
&gt; cylinder head like a washer. Really easy and you get the full spectrum of
&gt; monitoring capabilities. At least that is my opinion. If I am wrong then
&gt; please someone correct me.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Greetings List!
&gt; &gt; We have been driving our rebuilt 78 Transporter now for about a week and
&gt; everything is excellent!  After witnessing first hand the abuse my
cylinder
&gt; heads took from the overheating caused by the previous owner (missing
engine
&gt; tin, lack of seal, three inches of dirt, debris and leaves packed into the
&gt; cooling fins etc.) I am very interested in installing some sort of
&gt; temperature guage and/or oil pressure guage in order to monitor the
running
&gt; condition of the motor.  The &quot;dipstick check&quot; doesnt provide me a whole
lot
&gt; of comfort.  I have reviewed the archives and library, but am still
unclear
&gt; on the best/easiest method of accomplishing this task.  Someone suggests
&gt; that an oil pressure guage is all that is needed as it is directly related
&gt; to temperature.  Is this a safe assumption?  Should I install a cylinder
&gt; head temperature guage or an oil temperature guage?  As I am sure there
are
&gt; many options available, I am very interested in hearing your suggestions.
&gt; Thanks in advance!
&gt; &gt;
