Could it be possible that the fuel is leaking from a connection at/near the 
tank and is dripping down onto one of the ducts bringing air up from the 
heater boxes?  Kind of a wierd scenario, maybe, but it *could* result in 
gas fumes in tha cab but no smell in the engine compartment.  

This sounds rather odd to me.  Anyone encountered something like this before?
