&gt;
&gt; Front Axle Beam - Previously mentioned here; just got the rest of my stock.
&gt; No more available when present stock sells out.

This seems to be the new &quot;hot&quot; item at Pick-n-Pull.  I went in yesterday for half off sale and was
surprised to see that every Bus in there was missing, not only the tranny, but also the front beam and the
rear hub assemblies.  It made my job easy though as I was looking for a wheel and came away with a nice one
with excellent tire that I didn't have to take off for about $12.
