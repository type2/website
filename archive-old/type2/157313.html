Subject: Re: [T2] Hankook RA08 Report

Years ago - when I was even stupider than I am now - I
felt I needed to &quot;get by&quot; on cheaper tires cuz I
didn't have the $$ for proper tires. When I tried to
get them mounted, I was told by two different tire
shops that they would be breaking a federal law if
they knowingly mounted less than a class &quot;C&quot; tire on a
VW bus wheel for use on a VW bus and they refused to
do it. You probably could have gotten a free set of
proper tires from Les.

I'm interested in how much sidewall flex / how harsh
the ride with the Hankook &quot;D&quot; ratings compared with
say, the Cooper or Goodrich load range &quot;C&quot; tires.
Anybody care to try to quantify the difference? -BaH

&gt; First 6 years of ownership, my 78 ASI/Riviera ran on
&gt; 2-ply Load Range B tires recommended to me by a
&gt; local
&gt; Tire Supplier (Les Schwab).  They felt and looked
&gt; unsafe.  Based upon the tire load numbers and the
&gt; weight of the vehicle, the 2-ply tires WERE unsafe.
