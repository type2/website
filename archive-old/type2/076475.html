Subject: Midas Muffler [WAS: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question]


FWIW the nearest Midas franchise (this is a store in a VERY high-rent 
strip and they have every reason to be mercenary) has welded VW stuff up 
for me not once, but three different times, always smiled about it and 
declined to write me an invoice although I sincerely was willing to pay. 
I don't think they remember me but I take all my watercooled exhaust 
work there. Very generous, competent folks. YMMV

&gt;&gt; nah it is so those klutzes at Midas can weld em rather than getting em
&gt;&gt; bolted together right
&gt;
&gt; Oh yeah, that's right. Thanks for setting me straight.
&gt;
&gt; (They're not klutzes, they're good professional mechanics...who know 
&gt; that if
&gt; they were to bolt the muffler on, you'd just unbolt it when it got a 
&gt; hole in
&gt; it and bolt on a new one, but if they weld it on you have to take the 
&gt; car
&gt; back and give them $75 to replace it for you. Come now! Hasn't anyone 
&gt; ever
&gt; explained upselling to you?)
