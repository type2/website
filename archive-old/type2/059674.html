&gt; DOT 3 and 4 are compatible.  The only advantage, that I know of, in
using

if you

I drove
&gt; my '71 to the top of Pike's Peak once and they had signs everywhere
saying
&gt; &quot;HOT BRAKES FAIL&quot;.  Does anyone know of any other differences in the
two
&gt; fluids?

The only difference between DOT3 and DOT4 is the boiling point, with
DOT4 having the higher boiling point.

For a bus owner, the difference is moot, as the brakes are well
ventalated and you're very unlikely to boil the fluid before they fade
away due to heat buildup in the pads.

If this situation befalls you, please trade your bus for a Porsche, as
you are pushing the bus entirely too hard downhill!  :)
