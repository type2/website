Subject: Too Slow?Too  Bad!!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Every time I pull away from a light, I look in my
rear view mirror to see the car behind me lunge 
forward, then hit the brakes. They think I'm going
to accelerate like a &quot;normal&quot; vehicle. I'm just 
waiting to be rear-ended. Actually, that may not be
so bad, then I'll get the the rusted rear end fixed
for free, assuming the idiot has insurance, or I can
sue the other driver and buy me a $10,500.00 Westy!
 Seriously, I think the the solution to the road-
rage problem we have here in the Washington D.C. 
area is to have everyone drive VW Buses/Campers.
Red light running would stop, as &quot;punching it&quot; 
as you approach an intersection with a yellow won't
do you any good, and who really wants to go charging
through a red light in a vehicle with the crash
protection of a bus? The average speed on the Beltway
would be 55-60, not the 80-85 it is now!  Jeff
