Hi Matty
I found the coil overs for a mid 80's Chev Astro Van fit the rear of a Late Bay
Vw Bus
you do need to add a spacer [drilled out nut] and a longer bottom mounting bolt.

Ask you FLAPS to show you the coil overs shocks for a 1986 Chev Astro Van,, 
They have worked great on my Camper for over 150,000kms, and now I am on a new
set.

They won't lift your bus any considerable amount,, mine lift the camper about
1/2&quot; at the rear
