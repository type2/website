&gt; &gt; and if i'm not mistaken, by doing your own valves you can get a better feel
&gt; &gt; on how your engine is doing. i'm not sure how you could get a view like this
&gt; &gt; with hydraulic lifters.

&gt; I get a pretty good idea of how my engine is doing because I seem to end
&gt; up fixing it all the timew :)  Don't need any solid lifters to tell me how
&gt; she's running.

Yeah, but while you say you &quot;fix it all the time&quot; (which is where the name
FIAT, my favorite Italian car...) you could actually be under there more often
than you are by virtue of having to fix them damn lifters even when they
are running!  Think how much better feel you'd have for your engine if, in
addition to being there when you had to fix something, you also had to be
there when you didn't!

Been there, done that.  If I still had a type 1 engine, I'd get one of the
o-ringed cases and hydraulic lifters.  I have no idea why solid ones lasted
so long on European cars, except that racing engines do this (and it's
cheap).
