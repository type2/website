Arnaud suggested....

	Maybe heads are loose. I know you torqued them, but maybe they moved
	and are now loose. After a head install the good mechanics usually
	torque them after 1000-3000 miles anyway. So you have an engine pull
	ahead anyway. You'll get the chance to check all that.

	Forgot an exhaust gasket? (ask me how I know) Maybe a bad one.  Broke
	an exhaust stud ? Forgot that &quot;metal wool&quot; gasket between the
	resonator and the heat exchangers ?

---------------------------

Someday (if and when I go to heaven), I'll find the designer of the VW engine
and ask the SOB why he or she didn't make sure that 1600 DP heads could be
retorqued with the motor in the Bus.  But I'll be nice, I promise.  He or
she's been very good to me otherwise over the years.

The thing about with bad or missing exhaust gaskets, broken exhaust studs, or
missing &quot;metal wool&quot; gaskets is that these problems tend (at least in my
experience) to continue to exhibit noise indicating exhaust escaping before it
goes through the resonator no matter whether the engine is stone cold or
warmed up.  In my case, the problem &quot;goes away&quot; after about five minutes.
Very curious....
