Subject: re: starting/charging problems??

Sounds like the alternator is charging okay. I'd suspect a weak ignition coil
and/or bad points. Maybe a bad cold start injector or connection.

I am looking at a friends 78 federal bus, fuel injected 2 litre engine.
He's not very experienced with mechanics (not that I'm Mr. Volkswrench :-).
We thought in needed an alternator.  At rest, the battery put out about 12.3
volts, and when running at idle around 13.5.  Is that enough to charge the
battery?  The battery light does not come on in the dash.  He says it mostly
just doesn't want to start in the cold.  He tries to start it, and he says
it has to turn over quite allot before it actually catches.  So we were
thinking maybe it was just all the cranking that was wearing the battery
down, and not an alternator problem??  I found the little blue electrical
connector to the... I think the cold idle jet, on the intake manifold was
loose and didn't have the wire clip to hold it on.  Could that be all it
was?  Maybe a fuel delivery issue of some kind???  It runs pretty well once
it's started.

Can you give me a list of things to check or repair or try??

Thanks,
