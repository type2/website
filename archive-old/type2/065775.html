Subject: RE: Flywheel System Logic (was Eric Rainey)

&gt;A number of years ago, this was proposed in an article produced by one
&gt;of the CA colleges. It was demonstrated in Popular Mechanics in the 80s.
&gt;I think it was LA that did a study into the feasibility of putting these
&gt;systems into specially designed busses. The idea was that they'd pull
&gt;into specially designed charging stations (electric) to run the flywheel
&gt;back up to speed.

Of course in the Mercedes system there's an on-board gas turbine doing the
electrical generation--just pull into a gas station.
&gt;
&gt;The big drawback to using these in cars is their flywheel effect. Once
&gt;in motion, they don't want to turn, except on their axis. If they are
&gt;mounted on their side, it stops the car from &quot;leaning&quot; into a turn.
&gt;Mounted upright, the car resists cornering.

You have a point here.  I hadn't thought about the gyroscopic forces.  Of
course if you hold and turn a flywheel, it has a tendancy to try and rotate
you...Maybe this effect could be used to improve cornering.
&gt;
&gt;Another problem is in bearing design. Flywheels turn several thousand
&gt;RPM (300K, as I recall). Imagine what would happen if even the slightest
&gt;vibration was introduced into this setup... such as a bearing seizure,
&gt;or an accident.

The Mercedes design uses electromagnetic suspension--no bearings at all.
The problem with this design becomes bumps, but the Rosen Bros. claim to
have solved this problem (without elaborating how).

Let's hope we can retrofit our busses--
