hey  a westy is a camper that has been converted by the company Westfalia.
If your camper pops straight up it could be a Riviera conversion. You say it
still has all the seats. You mean like a passenger bus? If you have
passenger seats AND a pop top you have bought something somebody has
converted one way or the other.
Type 4 describes the engine you have in your bus stock, also known as the
pancake engine.Go to my website to see lots of different Baywindow
(68-79)campers www.72camper_dot_com  and interiors. Also its probably a good
idea to just plunge into the type2_dot_com website and look up westfalia and
riviera to see the differences.
In addition a weekender is commonly known as a bus that doesn't have a pop
top, but does have a camper interior. Unless Riviera called their bus the
weekender and I don't know about it.

&gt; I know I will get a lot of flack for this but I need to know what the
&gt; definition of &quot;westy&quot; is?  I have a 78' &quot;Weekender&quot;, that is the straight
up
&gt; camper top, not the slanted, and has all the seats still.  Is that
&gt; considered a &quot;westy&quot;.  You see I am new to the bus thing.  I have owned
bug
&gt; all my life and am really good with a type 1 motor but not so good with a
&gt; type 2.  Also what is considered a type 4?
&gt; Thanks for the help,
&gt; Larry Morris
