Subject: Re: [T2] Starts and stalls right away

&gt; it started right away and immediatly stalled. This could be repeated for about
5 times and then, it would just turn over and not start at all. After waiting
for &gt;about 5 minutes, it would do it again (start and stall right away for about
5 times until it would no longer start at all).

Blake,

Take Tim's advice first ,then turn here if that wasn't the problem.

Check and double-check your hoses in the engine compartment (assuming its FI
ofcourse). MAINLY the hose that connects to the air plenum just in front (FIF)
and under the cold start valve, this one is commonly overlooked. Also check all
the hoses on the S-pipe for proper fitting.

If its not FI, then ignore this message.
