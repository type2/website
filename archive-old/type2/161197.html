Subject: Re: [T2] VW Type2 on XBox 360

&gt;Are there any good games out there with
&gt;VWs (especially VW Type2s and Type1s)?

 
I'm a true gamer dork and have yet to find any with type 1 or 2s.  Because of the whole street racing craze there are DOZENS of games with other VWs, though, including old beetles, new beetles, tuaregs, golfs, corrados, and even the Barbie VW dune buggy, if you want.  &quot;Project Gotham&quot; Racing is okay, but I really recommend &quot;Forza Motorsport 2&quot;.  FM2 lets you REALLY design your own car (engine, paint, decals, spoilers, etc.) and then race it.  We were able to recreate our beetle pretty well.  There are also some scooby-doo games if you're satisfied with a vehicle that's only part VW.
