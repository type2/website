Subject: battery cable reversal

just bought a bus today 1971, westie, wasn't running but fantasic California 
body and general wear and tear, but I got it home and was going to jump it to 
se if I could get it running. I hooked up the cables on my truck then stuck 
them on the far cable in the bus then went to hook up the front one, giant 
spark, so I looked a little closer and noticed that the PO had bought a 
battery with the terminals on the wrong sides, the positive was near the back 
of the bus and the negative on the inside, so he must have just hooked up the 
cables without looking, so the cable leading to the starter was on the neg. 
and the ground cable from the body was on the pos. Does this sound wrong and 
what has been affected beside the starter that won't turn over now once I 
reset the cables. thanks.
