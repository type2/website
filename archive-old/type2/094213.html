Subject: Re: [T2] Any suggestions part two

Easiest way to check for TDC #1 is to remove the spark plug (on #1
cylinder), screw in a compression tester, and either use a wrench on the
alternator, or have someone &quot;bump&quot; the ignition switch (I use a remote
starter switch) and watch for the needle on the compression tester to move.
When the needle moves, look and the engine pulley and align the timing mark
which should be coming around to the case.

This is a fool proof method, really hard to screw this one up (unless you
don't pull #1 plug).

&gt; Need a little memory help here.  Checking the basic timing of this 2
&gt; litre engine.  When we are at tdc (#1) which cylinder and valve do we
&gt; check to see if this is the power or intake stroke?  (Which valve on
&gt; which cylinder will have just closed? &gt;or opened&lt;)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help,
