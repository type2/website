Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] Wanted motor for Bus -79 transporter

because of the amount of pmail I got about my solution to pancake motor 
problems, I will take pictures of the 80 vanagon with the upright motor in 
it.   It may take a while to get it with pics onlineable, but if anyone is 
interested in how I did this, please pmail me, and it anyone wants to host 
this on a website, let me know about that as well.  

Clara
