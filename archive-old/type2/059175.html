Subject: Engine Runs Hot, What Are the Causes?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Howdy Volks!

I really haven't found a good source of top to bottom troubleshooting of a
hot running engine.  So, I've decided to start a WWW page that outlines the
most common causes.

I need your help and experience.  This is a WORK IN PROGRESS.

What is the best way to find a vac leak?  Propane or carb cleaner?
Where do you find most of the leaks?
How do you tell when you have eliminated everything else and it is time to
pull the engine and check the heads?

Tell me what you know!
