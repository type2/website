Subject: Re: commuting in the bus?

Tom,

Granted, Rochester is not Huntington Beach, and also granted, Californians
are not New Yorkers... but:
many thousands of very happy (CA) commuters use VWs, (myself included 
when I was still on the job; I converted my bus and when traffic got 
really snarled I curled up in the back with a book and Dave Brubeck; I'm 
now retired). Many of us live only at spitting distance from the beaches, 
and cars do get subjected to inordinate amounts of salt air.

Driving a VW bus (to work) is a state of mind, not money. (Sorry, I know
you're tight with money right now but if you really want to you'll find
a solution, like setting up a plan with your cool mechanic or even a loan
from your in-laws. Commuting is getting to be the most degrading way of 
wasting your precious time; you might as well do it in your favorite, 
super customized VW. (You're sure 15 miles qualifies as a commute? Here 
in CA
we call that a warm up :')

As my favorite ice cream shop in Austin, TX, proclaims: ...Live is too 
short...
eat desert first!

Happy commuting.

&gt;How many of you out there commute any distance in your Bus?
&lt;SNIP&gt;

Any VW bus and a suitcase full of money
beats a 40 ft motorhome tied to the Bank.
