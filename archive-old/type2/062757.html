Subject: Beautiful weather for GA campout

Well the hurricane hit far enough north that Georgia will 
be left with great weather for this weekend's Peach State 
Transporter's Fall Campout.  

It will be held at Duckett Mill Campground on Lake Lanier 
near Gainsville, GA.  The campground is off Highway 53 
about halfway between Georgia 400 and I-985.

Bring yourself, your bus, instruments, engine cases for 
the bonfire, etc.

Dave
