Subject: Re: piston/crank/rod combinations

I almost forgot.  It has a GEX in it, with auto box.  No idea of the
age/miles on the GEX, but apparently we need to plan on getting it out of
there soon.

&gt;  Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I am in the process of planning a rebuild of a 2.0 air-cooled in an '80
&gt; Westy.  It belongs to a friend, and there are a number of things on the
&gt; to-do list.  Re-installing the FI (has a carb now), and probably building a
&gt; stroker are the two top priorities.  I have built other engines in the
past,
&gt; but am not sure what rod/stroke/piston combinations are advised,
&gt; discouraged, etc on the air cooled boxer.  Any help you can provide would
be
&gt; greatly appreciated.
