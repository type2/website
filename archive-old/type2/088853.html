Subject: Re: [T2] pedal crud?


 LOL btdt, many years ago driving a shortened dunebuggy over the grape vine
 in SoCal the throttle cable broke on the down hill side. After a long
stroll
 in the San Fernando Valley I found the only foreign car parts store bought
a
 bug cable and drove it home as a hand throttle.

 Van Is

&gt; &gt; &gt; And yes, I've gotten a bus home with a real strap hinge, duct
&gt; &gt; &gt; tape and some foam rubber for a return spring...
