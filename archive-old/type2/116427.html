Subject: Re: [T2] Heater

Hi Brian,

Wow. That thing is definitely NOT stock. I think the steel plate 
heat-sink overhead is an interesting concept, but I wonder if there are 
scorch marks under it.

At this point I will spew my usual rant regarding catalytic heaters: 
they burn propane and their exhaust consists of CO2, CO and H2O.

With extended use the H2O will accumulate in the bus and rust and/or 
mildew will follow. Please make sure you have a CO (carbon monoxide) 
detector in your bus before you switch that thing on, and always keep a 
window open when using it.

Better yet... don't use it without reading the manual.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hey guys;
&gt; Can you help me identify a heater?  Is this stock? or did someone add 
&gt; this
&gt; later?  I have no literature on this.
