&gt; I recently installed a booster check valve that I got from Richard

Let me clarify after Scott's comments...

At some point in the past, a PO must have replaced the original plastic 
tube + check valve with a rubber hose (without a check valve).  I 
attempted to fit the plastic tube that came with the check valve 
Richard gave me into the fitting on the plenum and it did not fit; it 
was too loose.  The rubber hose had a larger diameter plastic tube 
inserted into it that fit into the plenum fitting perfectly.

That is why I decided to splice the valve into the existing hose in the 
manner that I did.
