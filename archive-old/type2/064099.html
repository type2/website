Slick idea about using the buzzer circuit. I've never had anything buzz at me
so I never would have thought of that! 

Just to be sure, are we talking about the buzzer switch in the door that
activates when you open the door with the key in the ignition? I see that in
the diagram but wanted to make sure that there isn't another of some sort.
Where is the buzzer actually located? In the area of the fuse box?

Thanks,

Weston
