Subject: Fuse blows when I put on wipers?

When I bought my 79 Westy it had single wipers, the first click up on the
wiper handle didn't work, but the second gave me wipers. The Westy's been
sitting since Jan. when I bought it. I insured it today and all of a sudden
no wipers. The first postiion is still nothing, but the second one when
selected, blows the fuse. Any ideas on this?
Thanks in advance,
Courtney
