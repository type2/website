Subject: cable on aircleaner

Hey Y'all,
  I was looking at the owners manual again and noticed a cable running 
from the flap on the air cleaner to somewere. Where does it go? I know 
it must control the air flow either hot air from under the 
engine/exhaust and to cold air from the snorkel but I can not figure out 
where it goes and what controls it. And where can I get one? Anyone ever 
seen one? If anyone has one on there Bus I would love to see a picture 
of it and where it attaches. Thanks.
