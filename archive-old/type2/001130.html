I just got back from OCTO/Classic and my bus ran fine. Started the engine
yesterday and as I'm pulling onto the street the engine takes on a slightly
different note and as I put the peddle down it came alive! I'm guessing that
the advance was stuck and it freed itself.
?1 Will the vacuumed advance not working properly cause poor fuel economy?

Now I have lost the starter ( just clicks so the solenoid is working but no
start) and the tach quit and now I have lost all the electrical on the dash.
How do I go about checking for bad grounds, shorts, etc.?
Thanks,
Britt
