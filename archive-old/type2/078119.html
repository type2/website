Subject: Re: [T2] Do you need separate oil temp and pressure sender?

William
Check the Archives on Oil Temperature Gauges. I used a battery operated Oven 
Temperature setup available at you local Wallystore...straightened the curved 
probe and slid it down the oilstickhole &amp; corked it off...then made an 
extension of the minijack wire for the readout and set it on my dash, works 
great for about $25...just make sure you checkfor the accuracy by sticking 
the probe in boiling water and see if its 212 degrees.
This setup is nice because it also has a settable warning temp alarm.
Aloha,
Jeff Raven
