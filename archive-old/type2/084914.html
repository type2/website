Subject: Intermittent Wiper Relay Upgrade - Answer

--=====================_3998320==_.ALT

Golf's relay serial number is   357 955 531

Others part numbers maybe:      3B0 955 531
1HM 955 531A
(531B and C don't seem to be programmable!!!)
Replace your windshield wiper relay (it's probably the taller white one 
with &quot;271&quot; stamped on the top) with this one, and it's done!

To use your intermittent wipers:

Turn the wiper stalk to intermittent, and let the wipers sweep once. Turn 
them off, wait until you want the wipers to sweep again, and turn them back 
to intermittent. It will repeat that interval until its reset. If you want 
to change the interval, just wait until they wipe once, turn the wipers 
off, and turn them back on when it's time. If you turn the wiper stalk to 
&quot;on&quot;, it will still remember the interval for next time you go back to 
intermittent.

If you turn the wipers off for 45 seconds, or turn off car, it resets to 6 
seconds.
