Subject: New engine

I got my poor 77 back from the shop today with a diagnosis of the popping
engine sound as a failing gasket on the cylinder sleeve.  The estimated cost
of repair was up to $1000.  At this price a new engine is almost an option
or is it.  Any one else have to make this decision?  I've see some ads in
the HOT VW mag for $1250.  How much extra $ is really involved in getting
the new motor plugged in?
