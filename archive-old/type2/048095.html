Subject: [T2] front wheel well replacment?! AHHHH!

Hello again.  I may need some metal replaced in the front wheel well of my 70 
westy.  The rust is near the outter rubber side step.  Has anyone done this 
before?  It looks like it may be a BIG job!  It has to be done this year or 
next as well with one small spot in the quarter panel in the passenger side.  
Any advice will be great!
Thanks!
