Subject: Transmission rebuilders

Hello listees,

Can anyone recommend a trustworthy transmission builder, preferrably in
the central part of the country (I'm in Oklahoma)?  I would like to get
the transmission in my '72 checked out and replace any worn parts
including gaskets and seals before putting in the engine.  The tranny is
basically an unknown, but according to the PO all the gears worked.  I
am not opposed to trading it in on a rebuilt tranny if someone can
suggest a reliable supplier.  The new tranny of course, would have to be
from a '72 or compatible.  At some point, I understand, they changed the
bell housing (75?).  Does anyone know?  I am putting a 1600 in this '72
so the year of the tranny is important.  TIA
