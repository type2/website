Hi Steve.
I went through this with the Burrito Express.  Rebuilt the carriers on both
sides after the right side bearing let go while we were on the road.  The
left side has held up fine but the right axle nut would appear to loosen.  I
rebuilt it again, thinking I had bad bearings &lt;some might remember that
nasty episode&gt;.  The difference in my technique between Left and Right side
was that I pressed the bearings and races in the left side, beat them in on
the right.  Seems any play in the axle assembly wears the spacer outboard of
the outer bearing, allowing the stub axle to wallow around just a bit.  This
wears the drum at the point where it meets the spacer, allowing the axle nut
to appear to have loosened.  Don't know the difference between the early
bays and your bus but I suspect this may be what has happened.  I went
through 3 stub axles and finally rebuilt another carrier the right way and
she's been fine since.  It also took a new drum without the wear already
started to 'cure' this.

Actually, I'm more intrigued by the 23 per cent who are apparently doing
quite well for themselves.&quot;

This morning, I checked and sure enough,
the left rear big nut was loose again.  Again I have tightened it, but now
I am concerned.  Any idea WTF is going on?  permanent cure?

We will be junkyarding today and I will be shopping for a complete bearing
carrier/stub axle/hub, just in case, but would love to figure out what has
happened.
