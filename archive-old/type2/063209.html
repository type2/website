&lt;&lt;Here's the scenario:

I turn the engine to TDC for Cyl #1 and remove the original distributor. 
The top of the distributor drive shaft is oriented as it should be 
(according to the service manual).

Now, if I installl the 009, the rotor does not point to the crack on the 
side of the distributor casing where number 1 should fire. In fact it 
doesn't point to any post in the distributor cap. Of course, I can rotate 
the distributor body so that it does line up, but then I don't think the 
points will be opening and closing at the right time.

What am I doing wrong? or do I have to re-align the distributor shaft 
gear such that the rotor points to the cyl. 1 post AND the points are open?&gt;&gt;

Your describing the correct procedure, as long as you make sure that cyl 1 
gets its spark from the post in the distributor cap that's above the 
'cyl1-mark' on the distributor body. The points will always be positioned 
correctly related to the distributor shaft. There is absolutely no reason to 
reposition the distributor drive gear, except if you are using a 90 deg. 
distributor cap or you want to have the condenser in a particular position.
