Subject: Re: [T2] can it be done?

George:
Actually, if the cam is 180 degrees out, by turning the crank 360 degrees,
the cam will be in the right place.
I would agree that the problem is the distributor drive.
I would agree completely with your remedy.
the engine would NEVER have run if the cam and crank were off by more than a
tooth and then, it would not run well.

&gt; On to your problem.  I suppose that it would be theoretially possible to
&gt; have the cam 180 degrees out, but it is much more likely that the
&gt; distributor drive is 180 degrees out.
