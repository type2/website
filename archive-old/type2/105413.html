Subject: Re: [T2] rain gutter repair

Alan,

I've tried different things when repairing my bus, but the best is to 
just get a section of rain gutter from the Bus Depot, or whomever you 
choose, and do the repair full and complete.

Rust, as you know, goes into the seam and travels. The rain gutter is 
made up of the top of the bus, the rain gutter track itself, and the 
bottom of the bus all welded together.  This means the whole gutter is 
one big seam - bummer.  I had major sections missing, the whole back 
sections and more!.

Maybe you've only got two inches and my suggestion may seem like over 
kill, but I think that once you start to remove the &quot;infected&quot; area you 
may find the repair section growing.
