Subject: priming oil pump

Hi all,



After another arduous day with the engine, 1600dp, everything is
connected and bolted together. The engine is in the bus and after a
scary battery moment involving a poorly grounded negative cable I
started cranking the engine so to have the engine squirt the oil out of
the pressure sensor hole. It turned over about five or six times before
the battery died. The battery is charging, I believe the prior battery
incident took a lot out of it and now the question is how long should it
take the oil system to be primed? Is it usually a couple of minutes of
cranking or just 6-10 times that the engine needs to turn over? I did
this procedure with the plugs out and the oil-sending unit out.



Sorry for the long intro,



Thanks,



Max Bronsema
