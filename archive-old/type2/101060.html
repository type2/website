Subject: Re: [T2] Dealer Price List

Karl,

Whoa!  Yes/No...I didn't actually measure these as I was standing in a 
used car lot without a measuring tape.

I didn't mean to infer that they were exactlly the same, but by golly, 
close enough to be able to order a part that I can always trim.

The point here is that the *rubber* that I ordered can be trimmed!

Longer and taller might be really good for my bay as it looked
short to me anyway(the old piece).  

They also ordered the back &quot;bumper&quot; piece for me also.

The bad part will be if the thickness of the frames themselves are 
different where the rubber needs to fit.  This is why I only ordered for 
one side....I will take my old one with me tomorrow when I pick it up and 
compare them.

If this works though, then everyone with sliders can at least get some new 
rubber in them...even if they have to trim a little off the ends!

I stand corrected, dave&lt;grin&gt;

&gt; &gt; I was in luck cause I ordered it from a 81 vanagon parts list rather than
&gt; &gt; the 78 bus parts list.  Sliding windows were the same when I looked at
&gt; &gt; an 81 last weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; And again I say:  No way, no how.
&gt; 
&gt; I have both bay and Vanagon sliders outside, so I measured them. [Instead of
&gt; giving 'about' figures]
&gt; 
&gt; Measuring the outside frame where the seal rests around the edge end to end
&gt; [length]:
&gt; Vanagon = 41 3/4&quot;
&gt; Bay = 41 1/4&quot;
&gt; Vanagon is 1/2&quot; longer.
&gt; 
&gt; Measuring top to bottom [height]:
&gt; Vanagon = 16&quot;
&gt; Bay = 14 1/2&quot;
&gt; Vanagon is 1 1/2&quot; taller.
&gt; 
&gt; Measuring the center post where it meets the frame:
&gt; Vanagon = 15 1/4&quot;
&gt; Bay = 13 3/4&quot;
&gt; [same 1 1/2&quot;]
&gt; 
&gt; WCM outer seal part #:
&gt; Vanagon = 253-8411
&gt; Bay = 241-321A-L/R
&gt; 
&gt; The only part of a Vanagon slider that may work on a Bay slider would be the
&gt; felt on the center post.......
