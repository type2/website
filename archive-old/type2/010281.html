Hi Bud (and the 'list')...

A while back, I wanted to try to install the 'inside pull' that would open 
the rear door (hatch) from the inside.  It required a small hole to be 
drilled in the rear door (hatch) panel.  Then a cotter pin would be attached 
to the latch behind the panel, and a key ring (pull ring) to the cotter 
(welcome back, Mr. cotter!!) pin.  (The pull ring is just below the rear 
deck cushion, and hidden from normal use.  Please, no more discussion on 
this topic!!)

Well, having a pristine panel on my rear hatch, I did NOT want to drill some 
hole in it, and destroy a PERFECT rear door panel.  So I found a 
replacement.  A really trashy piece from a '77 Westy.  (Remember, I have a 
'78 Westy with the vinyl type wood grain covering.  This '77 Westy had a 
natural (trashy) wood panel.)

To clean up the '77 panel, which was peeling and spotty, I took some Acetone 
on a rag to the panel.  I wound up smearing the existing stain ALL OVER the 
panel!!  But it was evenly smeared.  Then I slopped over the panel with some 
Pecan color Polyurethane Satin stuff.

Well, the panel looked simply grrrrreat!!  Gorgeous!!.  but since it was, in 
actuality, a 'trash' panel, I drilled the hole and installed the inside 
pull.

After time, as I looked at the '77 panel and my really nice '78 panels, I 
decided to search out for more '77 panels to refinish the whole inside.  It 
took time, but I found the panels from the junk yards, for all but my 
sliding door panel.

As fate would have it, I went to a '78 Westy hardtop that was my first 
pick-a-part find for some interior door stuff, and I noticed that the 
sliding door panel was ALL WOOD!!  But this was the most trashy piece of 
panel that I ever saw.  Still, all wood.

OK, I bought it and took it home.  Did the Acetone thing (now on my third 
quart of Acetone!!) and smeared it all over.  Hmmmm.  Not too bad.  Just a 
bit warped.  Applied some of the Pecan Polyurethane stuff.  let it dry 
somewhat.

OK, not perfect, but acceptable.

So, just a few months back, I pulled ALL the cabinets and the z-bed, and did 
a full replacement of everything behind the front seats (sans the already 
done rear door hatch panel).

Completely happy with the results,.  Never going back to the original.

But, being -anal- on originality, I thought I would keep the original panel 
for the next owner, in case they wanted to restore the '78 Westy to show 
condition.

Well, after I installed the Vanagon Z-bed, I got over the 'originality' 
thing, and to heck with the next owner, because there ain't gonna be one.

The wife wants be to clean the place up slightly. (I have three spare motors 
in the garage, along with six Michelin XZX on rims, an original NEW Dunlop 
on rim, and a busted passenger tire on rim; need eight tires/rims to support 
my workbench, which is a cut up ping pong table top laid over two sets of 
four tires/rims!)

So, that's the story with the panels.  The only damage to the panels is a 
slight nick off the sliding door panel. The first person who sees them and 
needs them will buy them.

I am driving up to Morgantown PA on Saturday, our (wife+me, but isn't that 
the usual pairing??) 17th wedding anniversary.  I do really have an 
understanding wife....

Gonna visit BANKS in Conowingo MD to see if I can get the starter/solenoid 
off their '80 Vanagon CAMPER (only 100k miles.  I know.  I have the 
speedometer installed in my '78!!) and brew it up on Saturday evening.

See ya all there.  Barry sends

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Could you tell me more about what you did about replacing those wood
&gt;panels? I'm thinking of refurbishing my 78. Reply either directly to me
&gt;or on the type2 list.
