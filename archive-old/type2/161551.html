Subject: Cam Question

With a rough running bus down the highway a piece, I limped on home about 20 
miles. The next day, I found that the passenger side head came loose. I 
tightened it up and went to adjust the valves. The exhaust on #2 is way too 
loose and won't tighten to spec. I pulled the head to check the valves, 
rocker arms, push rods and tubes  etc, and all is fine. Looking at the cam 
follower (lifter?) when #2 is TDC, the exhaust side is about 1/4 inch 
receded compared to the intake side. Does this tell me that I warped the cam 
or damaged the lobe?  Or is there something else that I can't think of? I 
thought to throw this one to the list for some sage advice.....

My feeble mind says that I'm gonna need to do an engine pull and some 
interior redecorating.

Thanks in advance!

P.S. sorry to hear of the GWB Don. Someone down the street from me here has 
a '74' for sale.
