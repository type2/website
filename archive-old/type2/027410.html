Dear Steven.

I was interested to view your pictures of the VW-Porsche 914, 
oil-temperature sender installation plate.

Can you provide the part number of the installation plate and the screw 
thread size of the sender?

If the thread size is M14 x 1.5mm, then this plate would accommodate either 
of two VDO combined oil-temerature gauge sender and overheat switch units; 
having switch temperatures of 120 degC or 130 degC to activate a warning 
light or buzzer.

The part numbers are:- 323.803.002.002 for 120 degC and 323.803.002.007 for 
130 degC.

Regards.
          Nigel A. Skeet

&gt;Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I was talking with Mike Noble about a Vanagon he is thinking of buiying and 
&gt;I promised him some pictures. I thought there might be general interest, so 
&gt;I put them up as inaguration on my new Unix box, which I got up and running 
&gt;99% by myself! The pictures are:
&gt;
&gt;The Porsche 914 temp sender plate that David Schwarze gave me when I passed 
&gt;theru Dallas this June.
&gt;
&gt;My oil pressure sender. It is the dual light/gauge sender. I careved a bit 
&gt;on the tin with a die grinder and it dropped right in. I am just a bit 
&gt;proud of this. No extension tube, no altered threads, just dropped right 
&gt;in. If you own a Dremel or equivalent, this takes a whole 5 minutes!
&gt;
&gt;The correct location to plug in a vacuum gauge on an FI engine.
&gt;

&gt;Let me know what you think! (other than on the incredibly basic, done at 
&gt;midnight html :-)
