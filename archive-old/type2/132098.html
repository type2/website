Subject: Re: [T2] The continuing saga...

Glass bad.  Glass breaks, make big leak.  Plastic better.

I have had trouble finding a main idle solenoid that works.  None that I
have ever fiddled with have actuated when energized unless pressed in
slightly when it is energized.  The one that I currently use has the end cut
off, so it is just a dummy.

The others should click and actuate when energized.

Why are there three?  I find the best answer to this question in Muir's
Idiots guide.  Basically, these carbs are way over engineered.  They just
try to do way too much.  They try to make driving stupid proof.  Automatic
choke - bah, give me a manual choke any day.  Much of the mechanism of these
carbs are for making the darn automatic chokes work.
