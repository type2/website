&gt; Since there are no gauges (tachometer or temp)
&gt; in my bus that help me
&gt; determine how hard my engine is working, I was
&gt; wondering if you guys have
&gt; any suggestions on roughly how hard is too hard
&gt; to push my bus.  

I'm now on my 7th VW, my 6th aircooled.  Most of
my vehicles have been cheap and therefore in
dubious condition at the time of my purchase. 
All three dropped valves were when I was younger,
and drove the damn things full throttle.  Two of
the dropped valves were on an interstate hill.
Two were type 1 engines and one was a type 4
engine (you know, the one that some folks on this
list claim is indestructible).    

The moral of the story is don't drive the thing
hard.  I've heard idiots who say, &quot;you're
supposed to run hard, it cools better that way
because the fan turns faster.&quot;  Don't listen.  

Now I've grown up a bit.  I wear pants with
elastic.  I don't give a crap the people in the
other cars people who think vw's are slow, or who
didn't plan far enough ahead to avoid speeding to
reach work or that appointment.  

Drive slow.  Your vw is slow.  Even with a Jake
Raby 150hp engine, your still have only as much
power as a 4 cyl Caravan.  If you have 200hp, you
have as much as an Astro.  Your not fast, just
faster than you used to be.  No one thinks
Astro's are fast.  (The Astro dudes are always
sticking 350's in them.)  

I drive 1/4 throttle.  RARELY more.  1/4 uphill
and 1/4 downhill.  Rarely 1/2 and only for a
short time.  I drive like a trucker.  I gain
momentum going downhill and use it to climb the
next.  Only if I had full instrumentation, to
ensure I was not overheating, would I push it any
harder.  

I hope my engine lasts a long time.  I won't do
anything to hasten it's demise.  I don't care if
people think I drive like a gramps-- though I am
careful to pull off the road often whenever
someone is behind me.  No sense in making the
public mad at buspilots.  

Be kind to your ass, for it bears you.
