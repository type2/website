Subject: Re: [VB] Will it run cooler if.....

John,
	Leave the heater boxes and the fresh air hoses hooked up.  The 
boxes seem to act as a heat sink for the heads and they also may help 
direct cooling air past the heads and cylinders?  Some of the air from 
the fresh air hoses passes through the heater boxes and exits through a 
vent in the top, cooling the boxes when they are turned off.  The heater 
boxes seem to make the engines sound a tiny bit quieter.  I mostly see J 
tubes and the fresh air holes on the fan shroud blocked off on baja bugs 
and dune buggies.  This makes sense in terms of weight saving.  Also, 
nobody expects these engines to run very long......   Gary Gibson
