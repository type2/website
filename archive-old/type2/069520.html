They are still called barndoors, even without the characteristic engine lid,
because they come from the barndoor epoch.

i love that...  &quot;epoch&quot;   like the pleistocene.

Like a &quot;barndoor ambulance&quot;  (pant, gasp, drool)

susan and rick crandall had their 55 barndoor firewagon at vintage meet.  the
rear hatch is a barndoor engine lid without the lisence plate dent, turned up
side down.  the engine lid is a shortened barndoor engine hatch.  thus there
are a pair of piano hinges.  extra lights on the back tooo.   last year they
kept blowing its siren and the blue light on top would flash.  :)
