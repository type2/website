Subject: Re: [T2] using the blower fan for something else...

&gt; Just wire it to the fuse panel up front
&gt; ground it, and put a switch on or under the dash to the ground wire
&gt; I wired a bilge blower fan in my main heater channel that way.
&gt; the switch was purchased at the marine store where i got the fan.
&gt; good luck

I use the air conditioner blower in much the same fashion, mounted the
switch on a plug over the ash tray opening, since I don't smoke I removed
it and made an accesory panel to fit there, will hold 3 switches
