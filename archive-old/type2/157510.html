Subject: Re: [T2]76 Brakes (update) HeLP~!~

hmmm you mean on the MC ..?
   i didnt know i was suppose to loosen these...?
   
  thats does remind me of something i forgot to say earlier....
   
  when i press the pedal the ebrake light flashes on almost everytime..? whats up with that??? it didnt use to flash unless ebrake was pulled...?
  i thought maybe i had the pronged plugs hooked up to the wrong prongs but i swapped them and still does that....?

A couple things to check: 1st, is there a tiny bit of
slack in the linkage from pedal to master cylinder?
That rod needs to be free when at rest otherwise
you're not getting full return of your MC piston(s).

Did you bleed your brake light switches? (loosen while
under pressure just enough to let bubbles out - may
still be bubbles anyway tho!)

Still no pedal? Back to the store for another big
bottle of brake fluid... Go to the right rear and as
you apply pressure to the MC, crack the bleeder screw
just a bit - like 1/4 turn - just to where if you push
hard on the pedal a little bit starts to squirt
out.Keep working that one until (A)the fluid is
crystal clear or (B) you've gotten a series of bubbles
out. You may need to refill the MC 3 or more times
just on that one. Once you've got it, the left rear is
gravy - about three strokes and you're gonna be past
any bubbles that may be left there. You said the
fronts are working? Check 'em all next weekend again
unless they are absolutely perfect.



                                                                Better start thinking about sealing up those windows and leaky doors....
  Winter months are on there way,dont forget to break out the heater and Lets Go CamPing~!
