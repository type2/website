Thought I'd jump in with my own oil pressure uniquity.  Last weekend I
installed a VDO dual oil pressure sender and VDO oil pressure guage.  I
installed the sender on a 6&quot; brass nipple from the local plumbing store,
such that the sender towers above the block, just above the distributor
(I have a '78 2.0L engine).  The rubber boot fits nicely around the
nipple.  But to the point.  My oil pressure guage reads 60-80 psi. for
the first five to 10 minutes the engine is running.  Then it drops to
the 20-40 psi. range and stays.  I can't decide if I have a bad sender
or if my installation is causing the high readings.

BTW, it was really easy to install the sender this way, and cheap too.
Four bucks for the plumbing supplies, plus the sender and guage.  The
block and sender use 1/8&quot; NPT (National Pipe Thread).  The only
non-metric thread/nut combo I am aware of.
