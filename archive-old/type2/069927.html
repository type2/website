Subject: ultimate breadloaf, stainless/teflon brake lines

        Dave, Sami,
        Your milage may vary, but the only case of brake hose
failure on the street I have ever heard of occured to a 
Porsche with trick sano stainless steel over teflon brake hoses.
According to Bruce Anderson, Tech director at Porsche Club of America,
who told me this story in person, the stainless steel wires in these 
hose assemblies work-harden and can fracture suddenly. Not a problem on 
a real race car, or on a garage-queen that's getting inspected and shown 
off all the time, but on a mile-eater like a type II (or the 914's 
we were learning to tune-up) it can spoil your whole day.
        According the Anderson, the guy driving the Porsche was lucky
in that a cop parked on the street saw him put the brakes on (brake lights
lit) and then observed the notable lack of stopping power as the P
car speared whatever had gotten in front of it. P car driver was at
fault and his insurance had to pay, but he didn't get a ticket. He
and the cop walked back from the crash and found a trail of brake
fluid where the hose let go.

        Lots of people sell those hoses and lots of people use them, but
BE CAREFUL. Rubber hoses are slightly mushier, but don't have the
same catastrophic failure mechanism.


        Personally, I always wanted to make a LeMans bus- channel it
until the roof was down to the tops of the fenders, some sort
of bubble canopy for the driver, who would sit between
the front wheels. Use a gonner splitty as a beginning... couldn't
decide if the headlights should be saved as is OR mounted behind the
(DRAMATICLY) lowered front windows :) ...Assemble two type IVs into a 
type VIII 5.0 liter, 8 cyl monster... good thing nobody asked me!

        Bill
