Subject: 2 NOS 36hp heads on *bay for $200
Mime-Version: 1.0

That's what the man says.  I'm not on vintage but for any of you
cross listers, that has to be a deal.  He claims NOS, 2 heads,
bare.  He has a &quot;buy it now&quot; of $200.  Somebody has got to need
these at that price.  Do a search for VW heads and they'll be
there.
