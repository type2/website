Subject: free baywindow bumper/hitch combo


This is a homemade job, and was on my bus ('74) when I got it.  The
bumper itself is a piece of steel, with the hitch welded to one side and
bumper mounts to the other.  Structurally it seems sound, though
cosmetically challenged.

Did I mention it was free?

Can be picked up in Portland, OR (too heavy to ship).  

P-mail me if you're interested, and I'll send you a photo.

-Roger
