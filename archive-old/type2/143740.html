Subject: Re: [T2] Intermittent oil light

Mitch,

How hot is the engine after you pull over when the oil light comes on?  Would
you be comfortable handling the dipstick with your bare hands?

Does the oil light ever come on or flicker while the engine is idling, e.g. at
a red light?

What weight of oil are you using?

- Miles
