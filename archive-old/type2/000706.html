Subject: hydraulic lifter confusion
Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2000 19:33:39 -0400

hello list,

I am confused. i put in an AVP rebuild ('77 bus with 2L FI and hyd.
lifters)a few miles ago. I changed the oil today and checked the torque on
the bottom 4/side head nuts. they were right on. I put the rocker back on
and proceeded with the valve adjustment procedure for hydraulic lifters. I
put a cylinder to TDC, loosened the adjusters, tightened til they just
touch, then tighten 1.5 more turns. the lifters did not feel spongy at all
when i pushed on the pushrod side of each rocker. so anyways, I start her up
and she's making all kinds of valve noise. where did I go wrong??, just to
make sure, when the rotor points at a particular plug wire, and the notch on
the fan (or the mark opposite the notch) lines up with 0 then that cylinder
is at TDC, right?  before i loosened the adjusters, they were all really
tight, at least 3-4 turns before they came loose.

Any thoughts? suggestions?

Also, when the rockers were off, I saw a GEX stamp on both heads. I also saw
another stamp, AX . Does this mean that AVP rebuilt some heads that were
previously rebuilt by GEX, or does AVP have GEX do their head work, or
what??  We all know the bad things about GEX, but AVP seems highly
recommended.  What gives?

Thanks in advance,
