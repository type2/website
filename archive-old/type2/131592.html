Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Seized???

Take the plugs out and do the WD40, but leave them out until you get it 
turning. Less pressure to work against. But you said it was an Automatic no 
flywheel to pry against.

&gt;From: phil cain &gt;First take the spark plugs out, squirt some WD40 into
&gt;each cylinder, go under the bus with a big screwdriver
&gt;and at the flywheel teeth pry the engine back and
&gt;fourth till it limbers up enough for the starter to
&gt;turn it. Can't hurt to try this. And don't forget all
&gt;the safety stuff. Phil
