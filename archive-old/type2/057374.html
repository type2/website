Subject: Re: Shims, sealing rings, etc.

Several years ago I bought some new heads for my '81.  I realize now that 
they were probably the heads made in Spain (AMC?).  Anyway, they came 
with clear instructions that head gaskets were *not* to be used.

Maybe you have one VW head and one AMC head?

Can anybody explain why the Spanish heads don't use gaskets?

&gt;     I'm a bit confused. Don't have a Bentley for this engine, only a
&gt; Haines, but it talks about &quot;sealing rings&quot; on the heads. So is the head
&gt; shim in addition to the sealing rings from the gasket set? Seems like
&gt; that wouldn't give the greatest seal. OTOH, the earlier air-cooled
&gt; engines had no head gasket at all, and they did fine.
