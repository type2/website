Obviously, you don't want to go with Geico at that price, but there is
another reason not to do so even if their price was reasonable.  Geico
gives radar guns to law enforcement organizations, obvously with the goal
of increasing revenue through rate increases.

We're unlikely to run afoul of Officer Friendly with his Geico Gun in our
buses, but that doesn't mean that we should support a company that does
things like that.
