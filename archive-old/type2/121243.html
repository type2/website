Subject: Rebuilt or good used motor in the SF Bay Area - 1971 Bus

Anyone have a good place to get a rebuilt motor from in the SF Bay Area? 
I don't expect this block to be worth a quick at home rebuild as I don't 
have the tools to check all tat I would want to be super sure the shade 
tree mech who had it last hadn't done some hidden damage.

Instead I'm looking to swap in a good used or 'cheap' rebuilt motor (I 
know, you generally get what you pay for).


tia,
