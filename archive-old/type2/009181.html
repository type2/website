-&gt;Sorry to hear about your responses, but you find those kind of people in
-&gt;every group.  This list is a lot of fun, but there is always someone
-&gt;without any comon sense of respect that wants to ruin it for everyone.
-&gt;

No worries, I've been on the list(s) in all its forms for a few years.  I'm
not that easily offended:)


-&gt;If you let us know where you are, I'm sure someone will take you up on your
-&gt;offer, it would be a wonderful way to meet another bus person and the
-&gt;cabinets would be great to have!
-&gt;


I am in Portland, OR everyone.  NE section of town:)  Come on bye.
