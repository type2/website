&gt; Can anyone tell me if any replacement air shocks
&gt; exist for the rear of a
&gt; bus?

I just replaced the rear shocks on my 71 with
adjustable air shocks from NAPA auto parts. The part
number is #MA758. They are regular stock items. The
biggest issue is that you are going to have to get
longer mounting bolts for the top of the shocks, you
stock ones are too short. BTW, these bolts are hard to
find, but I ordered mine from mdmetric_dot_com you need to
get 12mm bolts with a 1.50 thread pitch that are 110
mm long, other than these bolts, mine bolted on fine
and I am very happy with the results after about 6
months of driving on them.
