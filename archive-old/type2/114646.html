Subject: Transmission conversion

I current thinking about purchasing a 1977 westy that was an automatic.  The engine was removed from the bus.  In the process the bell housing on the trany was broken.  The owner has a 78' engine and trany that can be put into the bus, except the trany is a standard trany.  What does it take to make this conversion?  Can I get some pics or literature?  Please help and if possible be as specific as possible....Thanks in advance and thanks again for all the previous help with my other bus.
