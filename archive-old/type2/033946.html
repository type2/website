Best fitting rubber around, in my opinion and those who have used it, is
available for most busses from:

Wolfsburg West
www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com

I think they have an 800 number and will respond to any question with either
the correct answer or point you in the appropriate direction.  They might
even have Westy rubber!!!

Take care,
Phil

&gt; BTW I did call VW dealer and guess what..yup you got it
&gt;  right again...obsolete items. Any comments or similiar problems

When your VW dealer tells you this, politely ask them &quot;what  are they
fitting
to the brand new T2s being made today in Brazil&quot;.
It works even better if a) there's a big queue and b) your Brazilian T2 is
parked outside :-)
[yes I know b) doesn't work in USA]

If that doesnt work tell them you are going to write to the national VW HQ
to
complain that the dealer refused to get you a current production VW part.

good luck
