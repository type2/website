	my 79 exibits the same problems. Does yours seem to ride higher rpms
after some extended driving (i.e. over 10 minutes) then when left to
idle slowly comes down. I have yet to go and diagnose the fi system, but
since it still works not on the top of the list. Would love to fix it
though.

&gt; I brought my 79 CA FI bus to a mechanic to have him bring it up to tune up
&gt; specs - especially the FI.
&gt; He found some vacuum leaks and a few other things and spent about two hours.
&gt; The bus starts and idles, but usually requires that I step on the gas
&gt; immediately upon start or prior to starting. Once I have stepped on the gas
&gt; the the bus will idle around 800 to 1000 rpms but seems to drop and rise.
&gt; Once I run the bus down the street and then stop, it idles at about
&gt; 1000-1200.
&gt; When I start the bus after running into a store (the bus is warm) 75% of the
&gt; time it will start right up and idle at 800 to 1000 rpms, again hitting the
&gt; gas or driving and then stopping will result in an idle of 1000-1200. The
&gt; other 25% of the time the bus will stall after initial start up either while
&gt; backing up or at the next stop. Increased driving time usually leads to a
&gt; regular idle at 1000-1200.
