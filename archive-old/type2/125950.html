Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Filler cap gasket

I've bought cork rings for 50 cents ea at VW shows.. they fit the splitty gas 
cap and the oil filler cap... not sure about the bay gas cap, but the 71 oil 
filler cap is the same thing.  When I saw them I got half a dozen... cheap!!!  
I'd suggest searching the online parts houses.

The cork just fell off of my 71's oil filler cap, can you just order the
cork from somewhere or do you have to buy a new cap?  And if so, do the
aftermarket ones fit well?

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
