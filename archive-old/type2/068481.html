Subject: RE: Insurance Deal

I can live with the 2000 mile type of limitation, but many of these policies
also exclude any trip (other than a club event or show) that doesn't start
and end at my property.  A shopping trip, for instance, would be a violation
of the coverage because the trip ends at the mall.  Ditto driving the car
to work, even on the nicest day of the summer, when your other car is in
the shop.  Call me paranoid, but paranoia is the business that insurance
companies are in, and I sure don't want any backtalk after an accident when
the lawyers start talking those dollar amounts that are bigger than my
social security number.

Read the tiny tiny print first.
