Hi,

I might be wrong but I think the 32/36 first appeared and was designed for
the Ford Pinto.

&gt;Talking with Scott Solomon today, and he mentioned that early K-cars and
&gt;Mopars of the frontwheel drive family used a Holley/Weber carb similar to
&gt;those offered as VW conversions by the usual SoCal, CalImports people. He's
&gt;right, because I used to have a Dodge Omni and the carb was marked Holley,
&gt;but looked almost identical to the 32/36. Does anyone know if these carbs
or
&gt;early Rabbit carbs (I think they were Zeniths) are re-jettable or usable in
&gt;a centremount setup?
&gt;Interesting info for us people who like to tinker.
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Courtney
