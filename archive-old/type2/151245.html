Subject: Wire harness

What is the consensus about the wisdom of replacing the wire harness?

I have my '72 stripped down for sandblasting.  The only thing left is  
the front part of the dash and the wiring.

The metal tube under the bus that encloses the wire harness is just  
about completely gone.

If the wiring was gone, I would probably completely remove the entire  
dash.

Are the wire harness products currently available recommended?  Or  
should I endeavor to preserve the current harness?  Leaving the  
original means not replacing the metal enclosure, most likely.

To be honest, I am underwhelmed with the wiring on the bus  
altogether.  I have engineered scientific instrumentation that is far  
more complicated and I am sure that I could do better, I am certain,  
however, that I am not the only fool who thought that.
