If the run HAD been at Bonneville I'll wager the electronically timed speed
would have been significantly lower than what the bus speedometer indicated.

It has always puzzled me why baywindow bus speedometers are so inaccurate.
I suppose even the vaunted German engineering has it's limitations, but bus
speedometers are not a particularly complicated piece of machinery and
they've had decades to refine the concept.
