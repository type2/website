&gt; &gt; I am sorry, I but I am confused.  When should ignition timing be set to
&gt; &gt; anything other than the distributor?  or where?  Do you mean he should be
&gt; &gt; setting his timing to match the block number?  Do you mean that he should
&gt; &gt; be setting it to match his carb?
&gt;
&gt; remember the looooong discussion on this some time back, you would set
&gt; timing different say if you had changed the cam, or switched to/from FI to
&gt; carbs because of different curves, now you should also change the dizzy
&gt; too but doesn't always happen, and then there is the .009

Bob,

I'm sorry, I had forgotten that series of posts.  You are right.
Everyone... if you have any timing questions, direct them to Bob.
