&gt;&gt;  today i pulled it off the track and did my best pit
&gt;&gt; stop. new fuel filter again, check and recheck valve adjustment, pull
&gt;&gt; and recondition 30/31pict, double checked dwell, pulled and found a clean
&gt;&gt; fuel pump screen, and set timing statically. when i hit it with the timing
&gt;&gt; light i came upon something i'd never seen. the cut mark on the pully
&gt;&gt;was at 4
&gt;&gt; o'clock and idle was good. (&quot;??!&quot;) it is supposed to be up at the split
&gt;&gt; in the case, r-r-right?  when i tried to bring the cut mark around to the
&gt;&gt; top the engine cut out, so i reset it statically, and ran for shelter. was
&gt;&gt; dr. volks von frankenstein here earlier? i cannot drive this bus. after two
&gt;&gt; blocks it stammers and clobbers itself back home. any ideas what i am
&gt;&gt; missing? please send forth wisdom, and thanks in advance - steve
&gt;&gt;
&gt;steve,
&gt;
&gt;1) what do your plugs look like?  Sounds like it almost could be running
&gt;rich and/or your plugs could be fouled.  Are you still running the stock
&gt;oil-bath air cleaner?
&gt;
&gt;2) are you sure you had the timing light on the correct wire?
&gt;
&gt;3a) are you *positive* you have all the wires going to the correct places
&gt;(I've messed this up, and everyone I KNOW has messed this up, until someone
&gt;else came along and actually was diligent enough to physically check which
&gt;wire went to &gt;which, and found a problem)
&gt;
&gt;3b) are you positive you know where TDC for #1 is and have your
&gt;distributor cap and wires positioned accordingly?  (this is a corellary to 3a)
&gt;
&gt;4) does the distributor advance properly?  (this one comes after you get
&gt;the light to flash directly at the crack in the case)
&gt;
&gt;5) does the timing light stay steady through the entire advance curve or
&gt;does it stop flashing at certain times?  This would indicate your condenser
&gt;or coil might be bad...

1) plugs had a very very light black soot around the gap, but that was seen
after a very brief less than a two block trip. one could say they were on
the fouled side, but the devil might say the engine may not have gotten
even nearly warm.

oil bath filter is in place. this is the stock set up

2) affirmative. it was on #1.

3a) sure as sugar in a beet.
3b) sure thing.  i took on the bus in two episodes today, and started at
the beginning each time using muir's checklist as a guide. i am going by my
TDC being the most left of the three notches on the lower pully.

4)advances well
5) it did break at times, so i smooshed the clip onto #1 down a little
harder. unfortunately, the new wire now has a way bitty tear in it, but is
recovering with electrical tape. (what are they gonna say when i am the
PO...) that gave the strobe more consistency  - AND, the timing notch came
up at the top. you and karl were right - its just that the clip needed to
be hammered in there tighter than the last time i used the timing pistola.
i buzzed around the neighborhood a milesworth, and i'll run it into town
tomorrow and see if i get the return of the stuttering hammering reptile.
but good for now.
thanks one and all - thanks for the bandwidth; all glories to the list.  -
steve
