Subject: Fwd: [T2] Bulkhead removal and different front seats

Bob,

The bus is a 77. I have also just read that the vanagon seats raise
the height by a inch or so.......any other alternatives? Take the
glides from some bay seats and weld them on to another seat? What seat
is the question? I have heard or some type of vauxall (GM)  seat but
my mind may be playing tricks.

I don't want to cut the bulkhead but I see no other way...?!?

Charles
