Subject: Re: [T2] windshield replacement...

OK, so I've got a replacement windshield at hand and a new rubber
seal from Bus Depot...I've had the seal sittin' in the garage for a few
years (a tree limb has forced my hand and now both the old windshield 
and seal hafta be replaced...;-(
The problem is the new seal &quot;seems&quot; to be way too small to stretch a-
round the newer windshield even after soaking it in the bathtub in hot
water and putting it out in the direct sun...
Has anyone replaced a seal recently (or even a while ago...)
&quot;Should&quot; the new seal be a tight fit on the windshield? I'd really hate
to break the windshield because the seal has mysteriously shrunk over
the years in storage... ;-(
