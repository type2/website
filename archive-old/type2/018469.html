Volks:

Is there anybody out there who knows the details regarding the swap meet
at the Maple Grove show tomorrow?  In particular, I want to find out how
much it costs, how much space one gets, and if there's an earlier
opening time for swapers to set up before the gates open at 8:00 am, and
info like that.  I've got a lot of stuff I'd like to get rid of; but
don't have the time to organize my stuff enough to justify a high swap
space fee (where high = the $50 they charged at Manassas -- I was the
guy with the magic-markered list of parts for sale on my t-shirt).  If
it's expensive, maybe somebody would like to share a space, hmm?

BTW, if anyone who is going is looking for something in particular,
types I - IV, please feel free to let me know.

Bus Depot / Ron: I assume you'll have a full assortment of tune up parts
'n' stuff like that, yes?
