Subject: Re: [T2] Type I engine in a 78

Over geared and overloaded.

Would be better with an early '70s vintage tranny at least.

Had a roommate when I was stationed in Italy that had a 3.88 geared Super 
Beetle with a 40HP engine. Same symptoms. Was quiet on the highway. You had 
to gear down for any hill though.

Take your friend for a ride in a properly set up 2.0 bus. Let him drive. 
Maybe that will register.

I have often gotten blank stares from folks when I lecture about cooling 
tin, etc. Maybe it is the material and maybe my lecturing style... &lt;grin!&gt;

The power thing is the reason I'm slowly moving towards a Corvair 
drivetrain. I've all the pieces, just need time and money to rebuild the 
Corvair engine.

&gt;My friend came by this weekend with his 78 bay running a
&gt;rebuilt type I motor.  At first glance, the motor looked
&gt;and sounded real nice, had new heads, intake, pushrod tubes,
&gt;exhaust etc, not bad, a turnkey for $850.
&gt;
&gt;Then we went for a ride.  Any thought I may have had of doing this
&gt;to my 79 went out the window before we even got into 4th gear.
&gt;I had to almost redline it in 3rd to get any pedal response
&gt;in 4th.  I could feel the engine straining trying to come up to speed
&gt;in 4th, it was almost hurtful knowing what that little guy was going
&gt;through.  Cruising speed felt OK, once we finally reached it.
&gt;
&gt;I lectured my friend on the importance of getting cooling tins
&gt;fabricated, all met with a blank stare.  I even gave him a URL where
&gt;he could order some and offered to help him install them, but I don't
&gt;think it registered.  As he was leaving, I grimaced hearing that
&gt;nice fresh motor straining to get that beast moving.
