&lt;&lt; &gt; Is there a gasket between the halves of the 77 fan shroud? Is it 
available
 &gt; or would permatex be a replacement?  Is separating the halves as easy as it
 &gt; looks?(worth it just to degrease?) Thanks!
 
 Don't think it comes apart, never seen one apart or any info on how to
 take the halves apart, I think those are just molding line

yes they come apart....i have taken three apart.  two from a late model van, 
one from a 411.  the 411 was a ton easier as it did not have the dipstick 
tube going thru both halves.  the ones on the van were a pain becuz of the d' 
tube.  but it can be done.  i split mine for the same reason...to degrease 
it.....there was a lot of caked on oily dort in mine.
