Subject: [T2] ):1973 westy for sale :(

I'm thinking about selling my westy due to my work changing. I have started
sanding it down to have it painted and that as far as I have gotten. If
anyone is interested you can email back at bltlawrence_at_prodigy_dot_net. You can
also see pictures at www.geocities_dot_com/bltlawrence . I hate to sell it but I
don't have the time to finish it.

thanks,
Bill
