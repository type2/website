BUS ALERT!

I found a '78 Sunroof Bus with a pancake motor in a boneyard I go to once in 
a while. It's not an &quot;official&quot; business, so noone ever goes there but a few 
of us regulars...

Anyway, it'll run and drive if you rewire the FI system (wiring fire) or 
switch to carbs. The body is rust-free (minor surface) but the rear corners 
are dented a little. Blue/wht with good white interior, no middle seat. That 
sunroof is a hoot! Crank works and roof opens/closes fine. Has cool VW 
buckets with headrests. Was running/driving a couple months ago. Floors look 
awsome! Love that Texas dry air! Denton, TX....says he'll deliver in 100 
mile radius....asking $750. This one needs to be saved. It doesn't need alot 
of work..You're about $300 in intake stuff away from driving a $1050 '78 
baywindow sunroof.

I'm hippy-izing a '65 Deluxe and waiting on a '70 Micro to come out of the 
body shop, or I'd get it myself. If anyone is interested, I'll get his 
number for you. Nope, I don't have any pictures.

FYI-         -EJ
