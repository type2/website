Subject: Re: [T2] Fresh air fan? Vanagon upgrade for late bay??

&gt;That fan on the Vanagon serves the same purpose as the auxillary fan
&gt;on the late bus which is mounted hanging from the engine compartment
&gt;roof.

In other words the Vanagon unit was relocated because the roof of the engine compartment was severly lowered. On the baywindow where would it fit? But like John says it's the same fan so why bother?
