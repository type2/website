Subject: Tables Needed

Hey everyone, I'm looking for a couple tables for a
westy...

My bus is actually a '73 but i'm putting an orange
plaid interior out of a '74 in it and want the table
to match. The '74 or later table that i'm looking for
mounts on the wall but is a darker colored wood (to
match the rest of the
interior).  

The '76 table i'm looking for is the one with the
curved pipe.  This is for my friends bus, and her
birthday is coming up so I thought it would make a
nice gift! HELP ME PLEASE!  I'm also looking for a
swivel for the front passenger seat for this '76 bus.

:)
Thanks,
Michele

There's a train that leaves the station heading for your destination, but the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more.
