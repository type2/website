Hi List members,
      Another mystery surrounding my '73 Panel Bus.
When I bought the bus I noticed a section near the
engine cover was covered by a section of Duct Tape.
Wanting to know what was under it, I took off the tape
and to my suprise I found a square (no more than 4x4)
was cut out and pushed down, exposing the engine and
carbs. The square was not fully cut out, though, just
pressed in. I thought nothing of it, and according to
the guy I bought it from he had no clue why they did
that. Well, I went ahead and fixed that problem. But
my question is why was this hole made? I went down to
the local junkyard and saw some Westy's with the same
cut in them, just a little smaller. Was there a
purpose to this cut, or was this just another dumb
thing down by the owner at one time? Thanks

      Phil
      '73 Panel Bus
