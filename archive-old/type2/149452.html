Subject: RE [T2] my bus comes home

Hey, Sam, nice looking engine...

Is this the same engine block that you originally sent to Boston Bob's??  
What is the first two letters in the block number??

And I am only guessing that you have an automatic trans.  Am I right??

Do you have any info on if these heads are new or rebuilt??  and the CC of 
the heads??  Are the pistons dished or flat top, or 'other'.  Was the engine 
'balanced' and do they tell you the specs??

Are the NEW exhaust valves sodium  [my '72 had two sodium filled and two 
solid]??  Since you went from solid lifters to hydraulic, did the rebuilder 
give you the stronger hydraulic valve springs, and how can you know??  Did 
he adjust the hydraulic valves, so all you have to do is ithe install.  Did 
he pressure check the engine oil system with a special tool so that any oil 
leaks would be found at the bench??

I have often wondered just what the rebuilder requires as a core, like if 
they are giving you a new set of heads, do you have to give them the valve 
keepers, the intake valves [one California rebuilder said they wanted the 
intake valves, but they said they were going to give my all new intake and 
exhaust valves.  So, what did they plan to do with all the intake valves??], 
the lifter arms - et al, the adjusting nuts and feet, the push rod tube 
retaining springs / wires, the valve covers, the bails, the ...  Since you 
are going from solid to hydraulic, I guess the lifter arms have the spacers 
in it and not the springs, or is it the other way around??

I guess you sent the flex plate, but if it was a stick, would you have to 
send the fly wheel, and would they resurface it?? The shims??   The -5- 
special bolts.

When they send it back, do you still have to recheck the end play, or have 
they told you what the end play was measured at??

Without any of the info on what is considered a 'core', I would not send the 
oil filter, nor the oil filter attachment to the block, nor the oil cooler, 
nor the dipstick / filler tube /  oil pump.  But without all that stuff, how 
can the rebuilder test the engine??  Or do they give you a new oil pump, so 
all you need send is the oil pump cover and four screws??

I am just a bit confused, but many of you know that is my perpetual state ! 
! !
