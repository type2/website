&lt;&lt; Why are the use of air ducts an optional design consideration?
 &gt;&gt;

On my 71 1600, I capped off the air ducts from the fan housing
and mounted a three speed blower motor in the spare tire well.
I ran a &quot;Y&quot; adapter out of high temp PVC pipe and aluminum tub-
ing to the heat exchangers. Recirculating the interior air was 
great for heat (lousy for noise, tho')...
If you live in a very warm climate or are using the engine in a
dune buggy, say, the air ducts might not be used and the &quot;extra&quot;
air better used to cool the engine...
