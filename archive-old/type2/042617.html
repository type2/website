Subject: Bus won't return to idle

Volks,

Well, I flunked my first try at emissions today.  The problem is that it
will not return to idle on its own.  when you start it, it idles at ~900,
but crank it to 2500 for 30 seconds (part of the test) and let off the gas
and it will only drop back to ~1200-1500.  I suspect the decel valve is
the culprit.  Karl gave me a test, whihc I administered, and if it passing
vacuum, it ain't passing much :-( I have ordered a replacement ($100!!!)
and will flip it in on Saturday, but...

Oh, mighty list, is there anything else it might be?  anything I have not
thought of?  The engine is freshly tuned, good compressions (fresh
rebuild), I cleaned up the throttle body during the flipping back and
forth, so I don't think it is sticking (test?)  The engine is a 2L hyd.
lifter and FI is off a '78, FYI.
