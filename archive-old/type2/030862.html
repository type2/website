&gt; Any one have an extra HE to Fan Shroud cover lying around?

&gt; You know the one that covers the flap on the bottom  and is held in
&gt; place with two screws.  At least one was on my '78 and I would really
&gt; like to have one for the other side.

???? no not sure what piece you are talking about, I have most of the tin
&gt;from a &quot;doner&quot; engine that I use as a spare for when I take my 2L out to
work on.  Don't use the bottom tin as I have removed the entire heat
system, including all the _at_#$&amp;* metal on the tail pipes inside the heat
exchanger. (I have an Eberspracher(sp) gas fired mounted under the front)

if I have it and you want it, it's your for shipping costs
