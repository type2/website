Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cooler question

The Top hole on the case is from the filter, and is where the oil comes out of
the case, into the cooler

the bottom hole is where the oil returns to the case galleys to the bearings

&gt; On the Type 4 2.0L engine, there are two holes on the oil cooler housing where the oil cooler is attached to the engine.  Can someone tell me how the oil is routed?  Is the top hole for oil OUT or IN?  I am trying to set up and remote oil cooler and need to know how the oil flows through those two ports.
