Subject: Re: [T2] Blower fan to HE tubes

Hi Doug - You could use anything that you can shape to
fit and clamp in place. The stock tube makes it a lot
easier. You may or may not be aware that those
openings need to be sealed if the hoses aren't in
place and the   flaps on the electric blower need to
be functional as well. With my quad headtemp gauge I
was able to experiment with a lot of different
scenarios and one was running without those openings
closed off. I do not remember the numbers, but it was
considerably hotter with them open. I used about 4
layers of aluminum foil wrapped over the stub and
secured with a hose clamp when I didn't have the hoses
on.

The opening provides an easier path for cooling air
than the path it is supposed to take around the
cylinders. Without the resistance of that path being
closed, you aren't getting proper cooling elsewhere.
I would think that you would be able to find that
component used, but as I said, anything that you can
make work will work. -BaH

&gt; Hey all,

 After driving Busses for 8 years, this year I am
 going to finally have a Bus
 with some heat. The new (to me) Bus I bought last
 summer has most of the
 heating system intact except the flaps between the
 heat exchangers and the fan
 shroud and the tubes that go from the blower fan to
 the heat exchangers. I've
 acquired the flaps now I just need the tubes, but I
 noticed that in some
 pictures of other folks' Busses there is a plastic (
 ? ) tube the connects the
 passenger side heat exchanger with the oval opening
 to the paper tube that
 runs to the electric fan. I of course am missing
 that piece. Do I need this
 part? Are any available? Can you just use the paper
 tubes? What are other
 folks using? I just want to be able clear the
 windows and maybe take the edge
 off when it's cool in the morning. My Bus will never
 see salt so I don't need
 a lot of heat for winter.
