Eric,

I would agree with others who think it may be an exhaust leak.  I would
specifically look for a blown seal between the headers/heaterboxes and the
head.  The best test of this is to start it up in the AM and slap a wad of
rags over the exhaust.  If the engine does not slow/stall within ~5
seconds, then there is an exhaust leak.

The other thought I have, since you mention adjusting you hydraulic valves
is, Have you done an &quot;after&quot; compression test?  If they are a bit too
tight or if the original problem was caused by a dead lifter, then you may
have a valve propped open (not good)
