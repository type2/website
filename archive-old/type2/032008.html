All the Bentley illustrations show the CV boot being attached to the 
non-grooved side of the CV.  However, when I took my 4 new CV joints to 
the shop to have them pressed on the axle halfs, the shop attached the CV 
boots to the grooved side.  When I pointed this out I was assured that it 
made NO DIFFERENCE.  

So, I really don't know the answer to your question.

&gt; As im reassembling my cv joints much to my dismay, I noticed one side of the 
&gt; cv has a groove and the othe side has no groove . Does it really matter does 
&gt; the groove side go against the tranny and the other against the boot or versa 
&gt; a visa, I hope it does not matter cause I got em backwards if there is such a 
&gt; thing.
