I am having a problem with the idle speed on my 76 westy.  When it it warmed
up everything is fine.  When it is cold, the speed is too low &amp; the engine
dies unless you keep your foot on the pedal.  I have checked the aux air
regulator.  It passes air when cold.  The hoses are tight &amp; leak free.
Everything else seems fine as far as the running goes.  Any ideas?
