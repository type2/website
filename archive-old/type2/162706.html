&gt; stupid you now know why. All the knowledge I'm getting is through the

&gt; to clean it up and make it look nice, but I want to do that in a way that
&gt;
&gt; I finally decided to just start sanding the door to see what was there under
&gt; the yellow paint. What you see is what I accomplished after 2-3 hours and a
&gt; pack of SandBlaster sandpaper 60 grit using a sheet finishing sander. I
&gt; would appreciate any general advice about what steps I should take next in
&gt; dealing with the holes, small dent below the holes, and rust. I would like
&gt; to know If there's a faster way to remove the rest of the paint. How safe

everything faster is also more expensive.

&gt; would it be to use chemical removers that would drip onto the grass? My plan

don't bother there aren't any that will remove the paint without nasty
side effects

&gt; is to work on the bus a section at a time to get it ready for a professional

good way to work

&gt; rust and of course they all make great claims. Busdepot_dot_com has something
&gt; called POR-15 that claims you just paint over the rust with it. I would like

Por 15 works, but it is too expensive to paint a bus with.  use it in the
high rust prone areas.

. get all the rust off, and when you think you have it all off, check
again.
. put on aa goood coat of primer (not that red crap either)
. I would then cover with a rattle can coat of some decent color. not
because it is finished but it protects better than primer, primer is to
help paint stick not protect the metal.

getting rid of the rust is the one key thing,
