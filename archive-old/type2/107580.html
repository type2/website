&gt; Is it a one or more wire o2 sensor.
&gt; You know how these things work, right?  They are supposed to flucuate
&gt; rapidly back and forth between lean and rich when at running rpm and
&gt; unless you have a heated one, they have to get hot before they work.

It's one-wire, and I understand completely how they work.  I had driven
around for 20 minutes or so before pulling back into the driveway to begin
the test and all the fluctuations were on the &quot;lean&quot; side, .3 volts and
below.

&gt; If it is a one wire, then you have to have a good ground where it is
&gt; installed.

I grounded it right at the sensor itself, which should be as good as it
gets.

&gt; I don't think that you are going to get much action out of the o2
&gt; sensor with the CO screw at idle.

No, if everything is functioning properly you should be able to run it from
dead lean to over-rich using to CO screw at idle.  It's the only &quot;official&quot;
adjustment in the whole system.
