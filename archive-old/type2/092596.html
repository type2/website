Subject: Re: [T2] Weber DFV 228


I have printed this out and will try to find info on them. DFV is common 
but I don't recall ever seeing the 228 id. If I can't find them in my 
resources, my next call would be to Pierce Manifold in LA, CA, among the 
very highest knowledge bases and parts sources for all things Weber in America.

If you can't afford to waste money on no-name parts, they just might have 
genuine Weber rebuild kits, with diagrams and procedures, and gaskets and 
seals and bearings that By-doG FIT and FUNCTION superbly.
