Subject: [T2] heater update (very exciting)

I got the heater boxes from the 74 bolted up this afternoon.
 
It was a bit more challenging than I wanted due to some distortion
in the manifolds.  That issue disappeared with a little love from
the torch and a hammer.
 
I was fairly fortunate in finding most of the ducts in the junkyard
along with the heater boxes. They had already been removed by whomever
brought the buses to the yard; the engine had been torn into. The owners
clearly gave up and scrapped it.
 
Only major issue so far is that the alternator bracket on the later
years
appears to be too long. I just shortened it with a hacksaw.
 
I ended up using the exhuast system from my project vanagon to bolt
to the heater boxes. It needed some studs replaced, but other than that,
it fit right up. I ended up using superglue to hold the exahust gaskets
to the heads while I fit the exhaust. I think it worked fairly slick.
 
It's amusing to drive a 77 with 74 heater boxes and 81 exhaust.
 
The next step tomorrow is actually getting the heater boxes hooked into
the &quot;heating&quot; system. and maybe getting the auxillary fan going. I'm
seriously
considering just plumbing the heater boxes directly. My bowden cables
need
replaced, so if I put the flapper valves in, they'd just be wired wide
open
anyway. It will be March or so before I could possibly be overheated. 
 
Thanks to everyone for their help and encouragement in finally getting
off
my tire patootie and doing this.  When I get to Steamboat, I'll have to 
update ya'll on how well it worked. (if anyone on the list is from
Steamboat
Springs, I'd be really interested in hearing from you)

take care
