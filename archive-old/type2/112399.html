Subject: Westy for sale

Hello all

I have a 1982 Vanagon Westy for sale. It has 202,000 km on it, with 55,000
on a complete engine rebuild. Automatic.  20 lbs of oil pressure at idle
when hot. 40 to 50 lbs. at speed. Excellent condition, and I mean
excellent, except that the headliner is loose in places and there is a bit
of discolouration on the inside of the canvas at the rear, not visible from
outside. Fridge works perfectly.  Tape deck, four speakers. Original light
yellow/butter paint. Three gauges in pod on dash, otherwise original except
for tape deck, which is in the original radio slot. No rust anywhere.
$11,000 Cdn, or $8,000 US
It's in Brentwood Bay, just outside of Victoria, B.C. If you come from any
distance, we'll put you up for a couple of nights in our vacation rental -
