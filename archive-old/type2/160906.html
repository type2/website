Subject: Re: [T2] German Ball Joints?

&gt;I haven't seen any German ball joints in a lately. There are two
&gt;manufacturers that I know of, ocap (Italy) and nakata (brazil). They are
&gt;both good. Probably not as good as one made by Febi, but we can't get Febi,
&gt;AFAIK. There are also Chinese ones available (stay away from those).

The ball joints in the VW boxes are often Nakata Mexico (look for the big N).

BugHaus was selling US made VW boxed ball joints a few months ago. Their website says otherwise but give them a call to see if they can still get the US made ones:

Lemforder was another OEM. I've seen a lot for sale advertized as German but they have all been from Brazil. Wolfsburg West is one example.

I'd check with Bus Depot as they can often bring in the rare German made parts:
