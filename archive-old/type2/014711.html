I'm certain that Karl is correct; however, if you're not interested
in a 100 point restoration, you can also try a switch from a late
model Beetle.  That's what the PO did for my bus.  You might be able
to find one in a junkyark.  The only feature that doesn't work is the
indicator light in the instrument cluster that lets you know when the
parking lights are on.

&gt;No, 71 is one-year-only: 211 941 531 plain
&gt;There is a difference in the terminals.
&gt;The parts books are wrong. The E as it is will not work.
&gt;A while back someone posted a work-around circuit to make the E work 
&gt;in a
&gt;71.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Ronnie Feitelson&quot; &lt;Ronnie_at_OldVolks_dot_com&gt;
&gt;&gt; The 211 941 531E fits all type 2 buses from 1971 to 1979, the 531 
&gt;A should
&gt;&gt; actually read 311 941 531A which fits 1968 to 1970 type 2's  and 
&gt;other
&gt;VW's

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Quick question (I hope)
&gt;&gt; I wish to replace my headlight switch for my 71 westy. Bus depot 
&gt;has part
&gt;&gt; number &quot;211 941 531E&quot; for 71 thru 79, and &quot;211 941 531A&quot; for like 
&gt;68-70.
&gt;&gt; Mine currently says &quot;211 941 531&quot; - NO LETTER. Will the &quot;E&quot; part 
&gt;work
&gt;fine?
&gt;&gt; How about the &quot;A&quot; one? Anybody know the term numbers on each? I 
&gt;sent an
&gt;&gt; email to Bus Depot and haven't yet heard a reply. Also - when you 
&gt;order
&gt;&gt; these switches - do they come with the escutcheon?(The little ring 
&gt;that
&gt;&gt; holds it into the dash) - mine is missing and my rheostat shot 
&gt;switch is
&gt;&gt; currently dangling from the dash by the wires....
&gt;&gt; wink
