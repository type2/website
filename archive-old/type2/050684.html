Subject: Re: [T2] Best spark plugs?

&gt;Bosch defects include misfires (bad internally) and bad threads (out of the
&gt;box), which promptly stripped a friend of mines plug hole on a brand new
&gt;$1200 racing HEAD (not plural).

On this, John probably means basically the Bosch Super.  Particularly
in my experience the Indian made Supers.  German made old stock,
or German tri-electrode are great plugs.  The Bosch (and any other)
platinum plug with a small center electrode isn't a great idea in
an air-cooled vehicle as by their nature (particularly carbed cars)
they are going to run rich sometimes and those plugs foul
instantly.

NGK does make a great plug.
