Subject: Re: [T2] engine tin

Rob and all,

Check here for the engine filler panel:

http://www.creativecarcraft_dot_com/notforbug.htm

I bought this last year while fixing all the screw ups from my 73
panel's DPO.  

Very high quality hand laid fiberglass job.  With shipping (to SOCAL) it
was about $185.00.  It came very quick.

Satisfied customer!

&gt; Is there a source for engine tin when a type 1 engine has been fitted into a type 4 engine bay?
&gt; 
&gt; This is a 72 bus that I might pick up cheap. New mounts were welded in, but there is no tin (which will kill an engine and make me not want the bus). The rest of the bus is in good working order (daily driver) except for the tin missing.
&gt; I don't know the rest of the history of the bus or how long the tin has been missing. It is cheap enough that if the engine was bad it would still be worth the money, but if I can't get the tin I am going to pass on the bus, because I am not going to mess with switching it back to a type 4.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Rob Henley
