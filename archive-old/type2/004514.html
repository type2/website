Christian,

Your list of spare parts is quite complete. However, a couple of suggestions
come to mind:

1) Rather than take 2 heads, I'd take 1 head and a spare piston and rings.
If you drop a valve it's quite possible that the cylinder and connecting rod
will be semi-ok, but the piston will be toast! (Ask me how I know). Also
I've had a piston split in 2 about 15,000 miles after a rebuild! ( I assume
the piston was flawed to begin with). In both of these cases a spare piston
will see you through.

2) Do you think you should also bring:  Brake line? Shocks? Coil?

Best of luck. I hope you have a great trip!
