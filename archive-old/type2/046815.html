I have a'71 with the stock dual vacuum dizzy -looking in thru the engine bay
cover the front pipe goes to the left side of the carb just above the cut
off valve and the back pipe goes to the front of the carb if you have a
brass input pipe there-the dual vac dizzy is the best set up ive come across
and run it at 46' of dwell IMHO hope this helps-Martin '71 bus &amp; '69 bug

&gt; I finally found a 71 vaccum advance dizzy (#0 231 167 055) for my 68 with
a
&gt; dual port motor, and a 34 pict3. Now to put it in. Am I correct in
thinking
&gt; that the timing is set according to the dizzy number and not the engine
&gt; number? Meaning, I should set the timing to 5degrees ATDC using this dizzy
&gt; instead of the numbers given for the engine it self? Also, where do the
&gt; vaccum hoses come from/go to? I've got 3 possible places to plug them. the
&gt; manifold just below the carb, the side of the carb pointing torward the
&gt; dizzy, and then one more pointing out torward the gen. pully. The vaccum
can
&gt; it self has one on the front and back. Looking forward to getting rid of
the
&gt; 009.
&gt; thanks
