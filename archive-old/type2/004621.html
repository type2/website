Subject: Are floors double panels on 79 Westies?

I've lifted the floor carpet and there is some nasty scaly, scabby rust that
flakes off in chunks, but not right through. Would Por-15 and a wirewheel
stop this horror in progess?  Are these floors double walled? Also, the
underfloor was some sort of fibreboard that was soaked with water. Is this
factory? Please email me off list if you know.
Many thanks,
Courtney Hook
