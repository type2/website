Subject: Re: [T2] very frustrating electrical problem


Jim,
Dash light does work (comes on at startup), is not on or flickering during 
driving, and is very very faint when the signals are flashing (maybe 
spillover from other bulb). I was thinking of putting in a different battery 
and trying it, perhaps the one i have was on the shelf for a while at the 
shop i bought it from!

&gt;Jeremy:
&gt;
&gt;The fact that your battery reads just over 12volts is a bad sign.  It 
&gt;should read at least 12.6 volts if it's fully charged.  Does your dash 
&gt;charging light work?  Does it stay on or glow, even very faintly, when the 
&gt;engine is running?

&gt; &gt;Thanks for any advice!
