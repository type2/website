&gt;Maybe we could count the overseas people in as well and pass the baton to
&gt;them. Let them run a different leg of the expedition on a different
&gt;continent and make it global. What do ya think?

I like the idea of including us overseas people, unfortunatley being in
Australia you have to drive a long way between places to deliver that baton.
There is a largeish VW show at Nambucca heads from the 29th July to the 1st
August, I'm going and would be willing to carry the baton from Sydney to
there and of course get the photo's along the way.  Thats about 7hrs driving
and gets me halfway to the next state (Queensland) if anyone wants to
continue from there and maybe get us to Brisane then let me know.  Geez, you
never know we may get this thing all around the country although with thte
small amount of Aussies on the list we'd need to drive for about 10hrs each
;) Even if we could do some of the South coast and most of the East coast,
say from Adelaide to Cairns that'd be one impressive effort!!!

Cheers
