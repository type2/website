Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Parts for sale No CA + Question

I think I may have both 72's and 73's (thanks to a listmember). Carbs
themselves appear only to have minor differences in the aircleaner gasket
(72=O ring, 73=Accordion seal) and solenoids.

The numbers on the carbs are the same, but there are the above differences.
I'd assume you could use the 73 dry aircleaner instead of oilbath? Of
course, that would be my preferred method.

I'll take pics in a minute and post 'em.

&gt; Anyway, for the list:
&gt; Is there a material difference between the '73 duals and the '72 duals
&gt; that I need to be aware of? The dual carbs/manifolds, linkage, hoses,
&gt; bits and pieces are mostly '73. The patient is a '72 (oil bath air
&gt; cleaner yet to be acquired).
