&gt; I believe that the wire you are referring to powers the backup lights.
&gt; If it has 12 volts on it then this is almost certainly where it goes.
&gt; Took me a long time to figure that one out myself. The bus did not have
&gt; working backup lights when I got it, and it took some time studying the
&gt; wiring diagram to figure out that the power for them came from the coil.
&gt; Check your light assembly on the drivers side of the bus for a hot
&gt; connection for the backup lights.

So where is the backup up switch for the automatic transmission? It doesn't
appear to be on the nosecone like the manual.
