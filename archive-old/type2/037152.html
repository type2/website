Subject: Are you coming to EveryBus?

Hi,

If you dont what EveryBus is please check out the website www.
mindspring_dot_com/~ncbus/

If you are planning on coming to the EveryBus campout in North Carolina on
April 14 15 and 16 ( www.mindspring_dot_com/~ncbus/ ) I would like to hear from
you! So far it looks like we are on track to have as large a turn out as
next year and maybe bigger.

I am getting questions from folks about others in there are that are coming
because they would like to caravan down with other buses.Are you willing to
have your email address listed as a contact for others to caravan with you?

We are provinding burgers and hot dogs for Saturday night Dinner and are
need to come up with a realistic figure on how many to buy as well as what
items are being contributed to the pot luck.

There will also be caravan to Farmington and the IVWA is going to give us a
discount and I need to know how many are gonna do Sunday show?

So please drop me a line and let me know if you are coming, how many are in
your party, if you are gonna bring a side of dessert to the potluck and if
you are going to Farmington?


Thanks for your time
