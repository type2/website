Subject: Bosch Platinum Plugs (Resistor) in a Type 4 FI, O.K.?

Now that I've learned that my present Champion Plugs have a longer shank 
that can possibly foul up the threads upon removal, I bought some Bosch 
Platinum plugs (WR8CP), but before installing them I would like some advice.
1) Would it be better to get the non-resistor, if available in the platinum 
plug? I have the stock Bosch ignition, with no interference problems in the 
radio.
2) Would it be better to forget the platinum tip plug entirely and go back 
to the standard core W8CC? One VW parts shop said because the platinum plug 
can foul more easily, he recommends against using them in air-cooled 
engines.
3)The WR8CP is pregapped to 0.036&quot;, if I do install them I would presume to 
reduce the gap to 0.028&quot;. Or is the resultant angulation also going to be 
problemmatic?
I don't want to generate an extensive argument today, but afterall it's 
Friday!
Thanks,
Roland Finston - 75 Westy
