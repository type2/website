Subject: Re: [T2] Ebay tricks

misspellings seem to be one of the best ways to actually get VW things
for a decent price. looking under volkswagon instead of volkswagen is one
way, obviously wesphalia is another. remember that clock that went for
only $24 a few weeks ago? it was because they didnt LIST it as vw... they
mentioned it may be vw in the description, but it wasnt in the listing
title.

OMG! orange squareback in this movie &quot;rock star&quot;!!! LMAO! cool, huh?
sorry, it just happened to be on while i was typing and i couldnt help
myself.

... Of course, it helped that they posted no pictures, no description
