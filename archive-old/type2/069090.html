Subject: Re: handcrank apparatus - where to get it?

I had a '58 single cab pick up (back in 72 or so) that had the hand crank 
set up as well....it was a neat thing..as long as Thom says the engine is in 
tune.

&gt;From what I recall, however, the rear apron (where the crank goes thru) on 
the 58 (and presumably earlier Typ2s) is different from later typ2 
splits...mainly on the latching mechanism for the engine lid, so that one 
would have to change both the apron AND the engine lid in order to have a 
hand crank system...

I don't think its worth the effort...IMHO
