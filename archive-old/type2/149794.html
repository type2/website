&gt; What 
&gt; happened to your original handles?

They open the door but don't lock.  The locks are all loose in the hole.

1) Different as in the key goes in one handle and turns the lock but goes in
the other handle and does not
turn the lock?

Yes.  This is the case.  I got them from Wolfsburg West.  I think I'll send
them back and send my original handles to Steve as recommended.  Thanks
everyone.
