&gt;anyone have any retractable seat belts??

I got a couple of sets of retractable belts out of the BACK seats of some
late model Jettas at a wrecking yard.  Two pairs (one pair for my bug and
one for the bus) plus two lap belt sets (for the rear seat of the Westy) cost
me a total of $25.  On the phone they'd told me that they would be $20 each,
which is still a good price.  Back seat seatbelts are generally in unused 
condition,
since we Americans deplore backseat drivers.
