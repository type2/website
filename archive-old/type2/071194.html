Subject: Re: [T2] Front Axle Beam Needed
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

&lt;&lt; I personally have not had the guts to examine my front
beam but I have heard another solution that the list
has offered. It was to drill a hole in one end of the
beam and install a grease nipple fitting. Drill a hole
at the other end and then use a grease gun to pump the
beam full of grease until you start to see it comming
out the other end. then you can plug th other hole. &gt;&gt;

...Unfortunately, it's not the beam itself that rusts
out to the point of giving your bus a &quot;California rake&quot;.
It's the upright &quot;horns&quot; that locate the beams and
shocks and bolt to the frame. I don't know if they're
still available, or even if they're worth the effort, but
replacement repair parts were once available to weld
in on bug beams to stiffen these rust-prone areas...
I never saw them for vans, though.
