Subject: CDI - yeah

Ooooooooooooooooooooo!

I think I'm starting to like CDI.  Is this what the 80 vanagons use
because I was checking out my dad's and I noticed it didn't have points.

Increased milage, is this true?  If so, it's another thing that I'd like
to add to my list of items to purchase!

Anyone have recommendations as to what kind of system would work well on
my 76 2000FI?  Does bosch make a system that is better or do the
aftermarket ones work as well?

Thank you all MUCHO!
Mike
