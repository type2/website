Hi David -

Earlier, you wrote:

&gt;Does anyone have a better setup for this engine or know what the 
&gt;original dist should be? 

Problem with the 009 is the ~3 degree retard built into #3 cylinder
position.  You gotta be  _real_  careful about orienting the distributor.
 #3 ONLY goes to #3.  In addition to this little headache, you don't need
to retard the spark to #3 cylinder on a pancake (type 4) motor.  You're
losing potential horsepoweer to provide cylinder cooling you don't need. 
The original dizzy sounds like a good idea.  I've got a list of model
years and applicable distributor part #'s at the office.  Be glad to get
the info for you Monday.
