Subject: High Top Camper?

Hello,

I have been looking around for a while now for a good camper for the summer.
I have found one that I like but, its a high top. That means that it has a
permanent high roof. Does anyone here have any experience with these and,
any advice / pros , cons to owning one versus a pop top?

Im going to check it out tomorrow with cash in hand... so any advice prior
would be extremely helpful.

Thanks!
