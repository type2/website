Subject: Re: [T2] SVDA question

Manifold pressure does decrease as you open up the throttle, but like 
john said, that's a totally different beast.  Don't even worry about 
manifold vacuum right now.

on the svda, You have two different timing's at play here: centrifugal 
and vacuum.  Centrifugal changes with RPM, vacuum changes with engine 
load.  So, as your engine speeds up, your timing advances.  Snap the 
throttle open, and you also advance the engine.

Now, when you open and hold the throttle, the vacuum on the vacuum 
advance hose will go to like 15 and then drop to 12.  But by that time, 
the centrifugal advance has kicked in.

makin' any more sense yet?

later,
MIke

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Ported vacuum is off at idle, and over 1/2 throttle, MAP is high at idle and
&gt;&gt;decreases as load increases; totally different animals.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ok that makes no sense to me at all.
&gt; high at idle? so i have max advance at idle
&gt; decreasing? so i have less advance as the rpm goes up.
