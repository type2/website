Subject: One more part needed for 1970 Westy

The weatherstrip around the outside edge of my pop-top is missing.  I don't
know if this is just a cosmetic item, or if it really keeps the rain out.

I've seen these advertised from many vendors, at widely divergent prices.
Are these items all the same, or are some better than others?

Any advice on this will be much appreciated.

If anyone has an extra one lying around (and it's a good quality one),
please email me with info on condition and price.

Thanks in advance,

Kabayo
