Subject: cv boots and fi parts

&quot;I had all my CV boots replaced with parts from RMMW and after a month of 30
mile round trip drives to work and some misc. other weekend driving 1 boot
is totally ripped/shrunken and another shows very serious signs of
dis-integration also.  I have seen posts this year about this,  but I guess
it would never happen to me.  Is this a game of russian roulette?&quot;

I had all 4 of mine tear up in less than 2,000 miles, sent them back to
RMMW, they refunded my $.  I got 4 new ones from Ron at Bus Depot, so far
they have been lasting very well.  Now when I get hold of old boots that
are in good condition, I save them.  They seem to be made of tougher
material than the ones that came from RMMW.
