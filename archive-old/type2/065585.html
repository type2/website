Subject: It's cold in here

 I have a 72' bus with a 71 or 72 bug engine.  The heat exchangers are shot, 
and there is a VERY strong smell of exhaust and other engine fumes inside 
(when driving).  I removed the flexible tubes between the heat exhcangers and 
the pipe going into the bus, and capped of the pipe end (heat exchanger end 
still open).  This cap mod seemed to help the smell problem A LOT, but there 
is still some exhaust odor (normal ???).   
 
Since winter is right around the corner, what is/are my options for heat.  
Cna't afford new heat exchangers. 
 
Anyone have any ideas on makeing a seal between the Type 1 engine and the bus 
engine compartment.  Is it even necessary?? 
 
Where can I buy a replacment ignition switch.  Mine has problems makeing the 
connection to turn on the headlamps. 
 
How can I get a copy of the RMMW catalog (if they even have one - seen the 
name on this list) 
 
btw, This is my first posting, and my first van.  I love the van,  it is 
sooooo cool ,literatly :)
