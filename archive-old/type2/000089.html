Subject: Pushrod seal leaks
Message-ID: &lt;0.7891cf88.255f220f_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Chris wrote directions for removing seals with RTV on them. My new Vitron 
seals were installed lightly oiled and pretty much following the directions 
he listed.

&gt;-remove the lower cover plates, valve covers, rocker arms and push rods.
&gt;- lay underneath, reach up and grab a tube and twist it. At the same time 
stick your &gt;thumb in the
&gt;corresponding hole in the head and twist your thumb. The combine torque 
should 
etc. . . . .

&gt;- run some emery cloth lightly with your finger round and round the parts on 
the &gt;case and heads
&gt;where the tubes will seat. Just enough to remove all traces of RTV. Then 
wipe with &gt;a solvent soaked
&gt;rag.

Did all that.

&gt;- Using new gaskets on both ends, lay underneath and feed the small end 
through &gt;it's head hole and
&gt;down into the case hole, keep the gaskets dry for now.
&gt;- when the inner small end and gasket enters the case hole, stick your thumb 
into &gt;the big end of the tube(reach
&gt;up and around the heater box to the head) Your thumb should enter the tube 
until it &gt;gets stuck fast, now with
&gt;your other hand push from under the motor closer to the small end of the 
tube near &gt;the case. You will feel the
 
etc. . . 

&gt;go with Permatex 3H. Make sure your Oil breather box has a hose ported to 
the air &gt;cleaner/filter.

I ran a hose as suggested. It still leaks.
