Subject: Re: Poptop Canvas Install without Plastic Strip

Regarding the comment on installing the canvas without a plastic strip.
I have posted I believe about my install of a poptop canvas from Bus
Depot. Careful comparison to the original showed me there was not enough
height from the holdown runner to allowing the 1&quot; overlap you need at
the top to install around the plastic strip.  I'm sorry I pulled out all
those staples from the strip before realizing this. Stapling the strip
over the lifted canvas allows the staples to be hidden when the top is
up. and also spreads/hides any stressing at the staples.  Knowing how
difficult it would be to do the top first, and deal with screwing down
the runner at the tight rear, I decided to fasten the top first without
the plastic strip.  A cover edging available from a fabric shop was used
to hide the myriad staples that were used.
     By installing the aluminum strip at the bottom first, I got a neat
install of the bead under it.  I determined that stapling the canvas
flush to the ceiling at the top got me plenty of tightness, and so did
it with the top slightly lowered and held by 2x4's running to the floor.
I used an electric stapler with 9/16&quot; staples.
   Pics showing how tight the top canvas is even when done this way, can
be sent to anyone via email who ask for it.  MB 78 Westy
