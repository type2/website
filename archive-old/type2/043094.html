Subject: '73 Bus FS

Hello all,
I spotted a Bus for sale near my apartment and pulled over to check it out.

FS sign indicates it's a '73 with 20K on rebuilt engine.  The sign is asking
$2000 and the phone number is 703-836-0674.  The Bus is white over red and
it is an automatic.  It's a standard 7-pass. Bus.  The middle seat is
missing and the sliding door handle is broken off.  I did a quick
walk-around and the body looks very clean.  There are a couple
scuffs/scrapes and a little rust below the center of the windshield --
couple spots.  But no other visible rust and no bubbling visible.  There was
also no bubbling visible from around the windshield seal area -- that little
spot seems to be isolated.

I did not look in the engine compartment and did not look underneath.  Looks
like a decent Bus on the surface though.

It is in Alexandria, VA.
