Subject: Westy resto update...

Hi folks,

Spent the day making major progress considering the late start.
Neighbors (with pick up) took me to H-D for the fiberglass panels and
plywood etc, and I later went to another HD for my carpet rem. I picked
up major deals on stuff there. Bus was gutted on T-day, and today, i cut
the floor using the old pieces as patterns, as they crumbled to dust...
:o(

FYI, the original 71 Westy floor was a bottom layer of 3/8&quot; plywood,
covered by a  1/4&quot; layer to make the floor flat (3/8&quot; filled the
indentation at ground zero) and the results were great. i then used a
nice earthtone combo carpet rem from HD which was also bound and i used
this binding to my advantage on the edge against the wall and walkthru.
I also used the white fiberglass panel for the wall cover. Looks much
better than i expected and is basically everything proof. 

So far today, i got the main wall covered and finished, floor and carpet
installed, foam over engine area on, jump seat back in place, table
reinstalled, then sink and bench put in place but not attached, as they
have to come back out to replace the closet, but the window needs
attention first. Looks like it's time to learn to weld! Ugh! 

Anyone replace the windshield frame with the repair panel? Bus Depot is
sending me a complete nose skin, (what a country!) I'll probabaly just
section it, but it's good to have the extra if needed.

i took some pics, so when the film is doe Sunday, I'll try to post some
pics of the job.

thanks for the support and responses!
