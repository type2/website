I'm starting to see how much the leak proof version of l-jet would cost.

&gt;I don't see how the lambda loop would have any impact on idle vacuum.

I was implying vacuum leak = running leaner than expected.

I just checked the vacuum after the drive to work at I got 17.5-18&quot; again.  Does anyone know what phase the moon is in? :-)
