I am a consultant with AmeriCorps programs, substitute teacher, yard man,
river guide, onion farmworker, bar room bouncer, writer (so what if its not
that good), VW tune-up mechanic, and part time gypsy.  Mostly I think of
myself as a Jack of all trades, master of none.

I am not married (no one will have me), and I live in a shed behind my Ma'
house these days.

Life is tough, but I am appreciating it more everyday.

Oh.....I am also a professional at relaxing.  : )
