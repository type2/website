&gt; Excellent point, Ken - is there some way or objection to restricting the
&gt;mailing list to members only?

It's called a &quot;closed&quot; list. We and v_at_l are open, vintagevw is closed.
Closing the list would stop cross-posting. Gerry is opposed to a closed
list (even though v_at_l has been hit with some pretty noxious spam attacks)
because it would forbid people who read from Skip's page to post messages,
among other reasons, and I have to concur.

It is theoretically possible for both Gerry and I to keep a shared file of
&quot;permitted&quot; addresses but in practice it would be a bitch, it would have to
be updated almost daily in order not to defeat its own purpose.

And I don't like the smell of all this forbidding and restricting.

What would be ideal is server software that would let me moderate messages
from non-subscribers while sending subscribers straight through. This is
being explored as we speak.

I never did get the damned spam from sweeties_dot_com even though I sayed up
late waiting for it. Everybody gets salacious email but me. Story of my
life. ;)
