I have a 72 bus and I have been having problems with it recently.  When it 
gets real cold out the bus rarely idols it just dies.  So at a stop light I 
have to constantly keep my foot on the gas the car also bucks a lot when I'm 
moving mostly starting off in first or when I change gears and the engine is 
at a low rpm.  I've been dealing with this problem ever since it got cold out 
which has been about a month.   I think its my fuel pump because I have had 
problems before.   A couple months ago  (warm weather) the bus would just 
shut off.  I contacted the list and someone told me my fuel pump was probably 
going (I have an electric pump)  and that person said that I should replace 
it but for now I can go under the bus and just tap the pump with a 
screwdriver.  I haven't replaced it yet but tapping the pump after the bus 
would shut off fixed it and it would start back up.  Well the pump gets worse 
and worse everyday.  So I finally ordered a new one which should be here in a 
week.  But would that problem that I'm having in the cold be because of the 
fuel pump?   Also this just happened to me today.  Here in Jersey we just got 
our first snow (not much only a 1/4 inch) but the roads were wet and today 
after school I went to start my car and nothing happened.  Nothing worked it 
was like my battery was dead.  So I went to the engine compartment and played 
with the battery wires which didn't seem to be loose and I shook the battery 
a little bit and then went in the bus and everything worked.  But as soon as 
I turned the key I heard a weird electrical noise almost like something 
shorted and everything turned off again.  I shook the battery again and the 
same thing happened.   CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME??????????????????????

Thank You So Much,
Jon
