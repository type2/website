Subject: Caburetion suggestions.

Howdy Everyone,

Long time, no write, but here goes. A while back I thought I had seen a 
thread about caburetion suggestions. I wanted to get an idea of 
everyone's experience that have gone off the beaten path. Plus the cost 
factor. I've been eyeing the dual carb kit on BusDepot for my year bus 
(1972). This seems the least painless, but from reading the archives, 
I'd have to switch to the .009 which doesn't exactly make me excited. 
Please don't hesitate to respond with your own experience, I really want 
to go down the best path and hopefully not drop a small fortune into the 
fuel system.

Thanks Everyone

Tyler
