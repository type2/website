Bill:

Sounds like you might need to replace your brake hoses.  With the passing
of time, the hoses swell up internally and restrict the flow of fluid to
and from the wheel cylinders and calipers.  The simptoms include uneven
braking, sticking brakes and the ones that you mentioned.  Any hoses more
than 10 years old should always be replaced.  Hope this helps.

Thank you!

&gt; .  My first problem is that at times, I have a hard brake pedal
&gt; initially as I start to brake, as I apply pressure, the brake pedal will
go
&gt; down an inch or so, not much more than that and become soft.  There has
been
&gt; times also that the brake pedal remains hard and will not go down.
