I'm not an expert, by any means, but I agree with Steve.  If the engine is in 
good shape, you should be able to cruise at 70mph, real or otherwise.   I 
wouldn't suggest uphills and such trying to stay at those speeds, but I 
cruised plenty of times in Oklahoma flat land at 75 mph in a 78 Westy and 
didn't have any problems (except when my ex-S.O. added too much oil).  

I would think an oil temp gauge would be handy in this case especially and 
they can be very inexpensive if you find the right distributor.

Good luck and keep VW'ing!!
