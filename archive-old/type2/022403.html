I have received a grand total of two requests for the BN2 plug, and over a dozen for the BN4.  

Therefore, I will call and see if I can get the BN4 plugs, but first I have to make sure I have the correct part number.  Two people indicated that it was GZE 16, one said GZE 13 and one said GZE 22.  I checked my BN4 and it's part number was GZE 16 so I am thinking that's probably it but I want to be sure before I call.  

Also a few people asked about a plug for a BA6 but nobody included that part number and I don't have one of my own to check.  Would someone please send me that part number so I can ask?

Thanks,

-David
