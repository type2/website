Volks

been having a rather preplexing electrical problem off and on for some
time, today I spent 4 hours trying to fix what I thought it was, fixed
lots of other stuff but not &quot;THE&quot; problem.  (78, auto tranny, stock)

intermittently when I use the turn signal, rather than blinking the gen
light will come on, and the gas gauge will go to empty.   4 way flasher
works normally.  after a bit the gen light will go out, the gas gauge will
come back up and things will work normally for a while, or when I use the
turn signals the next time it will happen, sometimes it will go a week or
more.  

tis driving me nuts trying to find it.

wiggle wires, push this, pull that.  nothing consistant 

today I had the fuse block off and cleaned up all the wire runs and
checked for any crossed circuits etc. put it back looks nicer but the
problem is still there, also had the dash controls off, same back there.

????????  any ideas ??????
