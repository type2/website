Subject: Freeze 12 experience

Volks,

I wanted to share my experience with Freeze 12 refrigerant as a replacement
for R-12.  Freeze 12 has been around for a few years but for some reason
hasn't gained wide acceptance.  Their literature claims that they are being
held back by the likes of automakers, insurance companies, and others that
are already heavily invested in 134a.  I noticed this stuff is made right
here in Texas so I'm not sure it's available everywhere.  It is $7/can
(only a dollar more than R134a) and requires a license to purchase (easy to
get as others have mentioned).  It contains R22 and some R134a, and maybe
other stuff too - I didn't see an exact list of contents.  The cans are the
same size as the old R12 cans.

The temperature/pressure curves are similar to R12, with slightly higher
pressures seen at lower temps and coming in line with R12 at higher temps.
I bought three 12oz cans to charge my Mustang, which had it's charge of
R-12 leak out slowly over the past couple of years.

I hooked up the gauges and there was about 5psi left in the system.  I
attached the air-powered vacuum box up to the gauges and started pulling
down the system.  I know, I know, &quot;get a real vacuum pump&quot; but it was not
convenient to do this time.  I had to stop several times and allow the
compressor to catch up but after about 10 minutes I was able to pull 23
inches of vacuum - close enough for government work as they say.

I then started the car and put in two cans of Freeze 12.  Yup, no flush or
oil change required - works fine with mineral oil.  After two cans the
pressure in the system was already up to where the chart said it should be,
and there were dire warnings against overcharging this stuff, so I stopped
even though a full charge should have been just over three cans.  Took the
car for a ride, it was 80 degrees out, dark and humid.  Nearly froze my
face but I wanted to reserve judgement until a 90 degree day with the sun
beating down.  Unfortunately, that 90 degree sunny day has yet to
materialize, but on an 85 degree partly cloudy and abnormally humid day
yesterday, I had to turn it down to keep from shivering.

This suff seems really good.  If I didn't know better, I'd say it cools
even better than the original R-12 did, but I won't be convinced until we
have our yearly heat wave in a month or so.  If it still performs well
then, I will be sold on it and I will start stockpiling the stuff.  At $14
per charge it's a bargain and you never know how long it will be around.

OBC:  If Freeze 12 works as well as I think it does, I am going to strongly
consider dumping the 134a from the A/C in the bus and replacing it with
Freeze 12.  I have ester oil in the bus but Freeze 12 is compatable with it
- in fact, they recommend it if you need to add oil to the system.

-David
