&gt; &gt; 2.  If I wanted a more powerful engine, what would be the most logical
&gt; &gt; choice?  Would all the bus parts still interchange with it?  (I know, I
&gt; &gt; know...it's a bus, not a race car...but I'd still like it to have some 
&gt; punch
&gt; &gt; to it.  Nothin wrong with that, is there?)

True, Most people like stock on this list... Personally its up to you what 
you choose to do with your German steel!
I took the 1600 Single port out of my Pop's van and replaced it with a 
2110cc Race motor, complete with Race exhaust, ignition and inside 
parts.  The van will beat most 4 cylinders out on the road, and has tons of 
power on hand when I feel like using it. I also added a transform Freeway 
flyer so I could drive a little faster on the road.
Bottom line, I have been called stupid and an idiot for wanting a faster, 
quicker van.  So if this is the route you choose I am willing to help you 
out with more info.  P.S. People will try to tell you that the motor will 
run hotter, won't get good gas mileage... I can honestly say... I get 
better mileage now than before and I don't feel bad about pulling the front 
tires off the ground while racing away from the light ahead of everybody else.

Good luck with what ever you choose.
