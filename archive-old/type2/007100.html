Subject: Birth Cert &amp; OBR arrived in mail

Happy! Happy! Joy! Joy!

The birth certificate for my 63 truck arrived today from
Stiftung Auto Museum
Volkswagen

It was signed by Dr B. Wiersch, who Clara, Roger and I met at the Volkswagen 
Museum in Wolfsburg.

That is great and I also received the March/April 2001 copy of OBR  (Old Bus 
Review) with a great article on Binz's

Someday I will finish my singlecab &amp; get the bedslats installed!

PS I upgraded? to AOL 6.0- and cannot turn off the HTML sender of mail, so am 
back on AOL 5.0
Does anyone know how to make AOL 6.0 work with type2 &amp; vintagebus
