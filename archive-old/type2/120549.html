March 13, 2004 - XXX Root Beer Cruise-In
Issaquah, Washington
Greetings All,

We are planning for a fun cruise-in to the last XXX
Root Beer drive-in left in America, right over there
in Issaquah. Here are the details...

Date: March 13 (two weeks before Spring Meet)
Time: 5:00 PM
Address: 98 NE Gillman Blvd.
Directions: ...from I-405, head east on I-90 to Front
Street exit. Turn south onto Front Street and then
veer left onto Gillman Blvd. You'll see the signs...
Phone: 425-392-1266

The folks who own the drive-in are very excited about
seeing us stop by for a visit and have offered
lots-o-free-stuff (food, t-shirts and other
paraphernalia).
I will be arranging for a meeting place, probably in
the Renton area, for those who would like to drive up
together from the Southern reaches.
Some guys are talking about meeting at the Lynnwood
BowWow for y'all in the North.
Just holler if you have any questions or feedback.
Peace,
VW Bus Daddy
