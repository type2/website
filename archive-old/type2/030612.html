Volks,

The second half of the subject line is the give-away.  If you ever find
yourself adding this to the subject line, to quote from &quot;Paradise by the
Dashboard Lights, &quot;STOP RIGHT THERE!&quot;  On *no* day of the week are posts
with &quot;no bus content&quot; appropriate for posting to the list. Don't do it.
