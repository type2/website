Subject: Re: [T2] Bad Coil and Pertronix?

Wiring the coil is simple.. Hot line (from ignition switch area) goes to 
&quot;+&quot;, depending on the year and possible accessories there may be 1 or 2 
additional wires connected to this terminal.  The wire from the 
Points/Pertronix goes to the &quot;-&quot;.  Again, there may be an extra wire or 2 
connected there as well.

The way your coil works is when the &quot;-&quot; goes to ground, a charge builds in 
the coil.  When the ground is disconnected the charge then pumps out 
through the big lead on the top.  The points break the connection to the 
ground and cause the coil to fire.  The pertronix unit does the same thing, 
but electronically instead of mechanically.  Don't assume that since the 
pertronix is way cool and often recommended, that it isn't going to 
fail.  I've had 2 fail at unusual times.  Ever since, I've always carried a 
set of points and a condenser.. on the '71 I've gone back to points after 
being stranded on I-94 outside of Chicago.. way-not-fun.

Hope this helps
