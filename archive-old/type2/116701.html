Subject: RE:Door handles

My experience with the aftermarket handles is that the are a different 
keyway and can't be keyed to match your existing key.  If your handle is ok, 
why not try to find a used handle and pull the lock plug from it for your 
existing handle.  I've seen the lock plugs split in half a few times.  If it 
just came out. it sounds as if the screw holding the tailpiece on came off, 
and the screw retainer was loose.  Feel free to contact me if I can be of 
more help.
