Adrian,

&gt; Would you rather flip a hidden switch under the dash or mess around in a 
&gt; dirty engine compartment?

I agree that a kill switch is easier, but I'm told (and its easy to
believe) that auto-thieves know about kill switches and can find them
quickly.  If the rotor is gone, there's nothing they can do short of
getting a new rotor, even if they are smart enough to figure out what you
did.  Thats the advantage to removing the rotor.
