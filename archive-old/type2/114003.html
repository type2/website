&gt;I noticed that the temperature lights are on wires colored (Brown : Ground),

&gt;Those seem to be controlled by the headlight switch when I turn it on. I

&gt;
&gt;I then noticed that the gauges themselves use a blue wire for the positive,

Because they operate differently

&gt;Would it be BAD if I decided to wire them up correctly?

In theory NO, but unless you have a wiring diagram to go by, you would be 
compounding matters.  The Bentley manual has excellent wiring diagrams.

&gt;2) My second question is about my cyl head temperature gauge. There are 4
&gt;leads on the temperature gauge. The first two are for the one that goes to
&gt;the back-light. That's not a problem. The second two however are a positive
&gt;and a ground.

easy now.   CHT gauges are different beasts.

&gt;Here's where I get really confused. There is a LONG LONG
&gt;wiring harness that goes from the gauge cluster all the way to the
&gt;temperature sender.. which for the most part is basically just a loop-ring
&gt;with a wire attached to it. [...] At the sending unit, the wires
&gt;come together.. what's the point of that? How does the gauge actually get
&gt;electricity?? I'm assuming that it gets some sort of temperature reading...
&gt;but how can the heat be transmitted 10 feet from the rear of the bus to the
&gt;gauge in the front without electricity???

CHTs generate their own electricity.  the signal sent from the rear to the 
front is in the range of millivolts.
The term for this type of gauge is a thermocouple gauge.
That place where they come together in a loop is called the thermocouple 
junction and is the key to the operation.
Thermocouples operate on the principle that when you place two dissimilar 
metals together in a junction and then place that junction in heat, 
electrons will start to flow, generating electricity.  The amount of 
electrons flowing is proportional to the temperature.
There are many different

PDF, scroll down to Thermoucouples Page 26


One thing to remember, you CANNOT use regular wire to extend, move or 
change the length of the thermocouple wires in any way.  If you do, you 
will introduce new thermocouple junctions that WILL be a source of errors 
in your gauge.  The gauge is calibrated for ONE type of thermocouple wire 
and a typical inside operating temperature of the bus.  (I believe around 70F)

Hope that helps,
