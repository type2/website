hello all,
yesterday I fired up my 73 bus that had been sitting for about a week,
I backed out of the gargage and the radio started to make pulse noises
and then my bus died. and it would not start again. I would turn the
key and nothing just a click, both red light in the dash came on.
So I jumped out pulled the battery out and went and got a new battery.
put the new battery in and it fired up and runs great, my question
is, was it just a bad battery ? is my battery going to be dead when I go 
back home tonight?
History
the battery was about 2 1/2 years old. recentley when I first started the 
bus the battery light and gen light would glow,then shut off when I got up 
high RPM's.

thanks
