Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line replacement help!

Guys,

The old( I believe original) hose to my charcoal cannister
is plastic/clear.  The part that goes from the cannister
to the intake air filter holder.

Wonder if that is what he is thinking about....

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; 1. Karl, how about those MB partnumbers?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 112-476-12-26 for 10MM?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; what is the 7MM?
&gt; 
&gt; Should be 7.5mm. MB part # 916030 000527
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. The guy has described the new hose as being plastic and shiny. That
&gt; doesn't sound like rubber to me. What's up?
&gt; 
&gt; Huh?  No way. I have no idea what he is trying to sell you.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3. I told him 1 meter of the 7MM, is that enough?
&gt; 
&gt; For a FI bus? No, not enough. A meter is only 39 1/4&quot; long. That is about what
&gt; you need to go from the tank to the filter alone. Then it depends if you have
&gt; steel tubing on each side of the cold start valve. If yes, then 2 meters
&gt; should do it. If no, then figure 3 meters. Do NOT use worm drive clamps,
&gt; i.e.Gates, they cut thru the hose! Use the original VW or MB clamps.
