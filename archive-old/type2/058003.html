&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; I am struggling with a fundamental theory, is ATDC to the left or
the right
&gt; of TDC with the engine at idle and a strobe illuminating the scene?

Diagrams like this confuse the heck out of me. :)  Try seeing the
situation my way:

On the '71 pulley there are two marks.  On the rear edge (the edge
nearest you) there is a round dimple with a line in it.  this is TDC,
and is used for adjusting the valves.

There is also a notch on the forward edge of the pulley.  This notch
is 5 degrees after top dead center.  When this notch is aligned with
the crankcase seam when the points open the engine is correctly timed,
if the stock dual-vacuum distributor is used.

If the mark is to the left of the split when the points open, then the
spark is advanced (or closer to BTDC)  If the mark is to the right,
then the spark is retarded (or closer to ATDC)

VW used several different notch arrangements over the years, but the
'71 is pretty foolproof.  It is possible that the incorrect pulley was
installed sometime, which means that you'll have to figure out where
TDC is and what the notches mean.  If you have multiple notches in
your pulley, we'll discuss the permutations of VW pulley notches.
