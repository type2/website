Subject: whats the real deal on wheels
Date: Mon, 2 Nov 1998 11:08:52 -0800

Hi its me again with the 71 bus and corvair conversion, hows evreyone? as
some one who is unfortunate to have a lug pattern of 5 on 112 mm , I have
litterally spent a couple of years lookin every where for a 60's style mag
wheel for it, preferably like the porsche wheels, some wheel companys I
have talked to have said they could re-drill some of the allow wheels but
the modern style wierd lookin wheels in my opinon would not look right, my
bus is beautiful , it has new paint an ivory cream white top and a chevy
metallic aqua green bottom......and the freakin wheels are stock powdered
coated black and I put on a set of plastic wheel covers that simulate a
five star euro mag and trimed the edges in the same green as the body, it
lookes ok but they are 3 years old and they are starting to look like
crap...........Is it to much to ask to be able to finnish off my ride with
some cool wheels??...I know about the mercedes and beemer connection but
there wheels kinda suck, what about wheel adaptors , has anyone tryed
them?..._dot_can you install a 15 inch ,7 inch wide wheel without anything
rubbin. As of late I think it would be cool to have vintage bus wheels
chromed with the large round hub caps that came with them....any and all
possibilities would be greatly appreciated..........thanks......Keith
