Here's my experience:

Me &quot;I'd like to check the status of my order.&quot;

CB &quot;Have you ordered with us before?&quot;

Me &quot;Yes, that's why I'm calling to check on my order.&quot;

CB &quot;It should ship any day.&quot;

Me &quot;When did I place my order.&quot;

CB &quot;Dec 1st.&quot;

Me &quot;When I ordered, I was told it was in stock and I need it last week.&quot;

CB &quot;Hold on.&quot;

- another person comes to phone -

CB &quot;Richard, I'm sorry when you placed the order I thought they were in
stock&quot;.

Me &quot;When will you have them?&quot;

CB &quot;I won't know until Monday.&quot;

Me &quot;Please cancel my order.&quot;

CB &quot;Allright. We'd credit your credit card.&quot;

Me &quot;You charged my card before checking inventory?&quot;

CB &quot;Sorry about that.&quot;

Moral of story. Thank goodness for Bus Depot, Bus Boys, Go Westy, CIP1,
