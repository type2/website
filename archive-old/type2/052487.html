Subject: [T2] Need help with 2.0 specs

&gt;    I tore apart that Vanagon engine today and it looks great. The rod and main
&gt;  Main#1-2.356in
&gt;  Main#2-2.356in
&gt;  Main#4-1.572in
&gt;  Rod#4-1.963

Due to the kind consideration of a fellow type2er, I have the chance to
get me a reasonably priced set of 2.0L rods and crank from an air-cooled
vanagon engine.  Since I'm admittedly stupid about T4 engines at this ping
I need to know for sure #1 - will the ACVanagon crank fit the 2.0L T4
engine.  I'm pretty damn sure that this will work but not 100% positive.

2nd, this kind listee took measurements for me main journals of the crank
and a measurement off of the #4 rod journal.  I've got the Bentley manual
but I can't make heads or tails out of the measurements.  For the money
I'm going to spend on this stuff, it will be with the thought of using it
and not as core parts.  To the gurus amongst us, does this look to you
like a crank that has a lot of wear left in it?  Just what are the
measurements of a factory fresh crank?  The bearings that were in this
engine (with a good bottom end I might add) were marked STD &amp; still had
their polish to them.  

Neither the listee nor I knew the actual specs so I thought I would set
out on my own to find them out so I can let him know my answer.  If anyone
has the pages from the 68 to 79 Bus Bentley I can reference, please throw
them my way.  I can't seem to find specs - only tolerances.

Thanks again!
