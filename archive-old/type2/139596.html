Subject: Re: [T2] 1978, window crank failed

Bob,

I'm betting with a little ingenuity you might be able to get the regulator 
out without having to pull everything, but it *has* been awhile since I 
did it.

Good luck, dave

&gt;    couple hours ago I wound down the drivers window and it wouldn't go
&gt; back up.  some investigation reveals it is obviously internal.
&gt; 
&gt; Bentley isn't very informative but it looks like a PITA to fix
&gt;  so
&gt; anyone who has done this, how difficult??
&gt; is the driver side and passenger side the same (I have a pass side door)
&gt; if not are they avaliable.  &quot;Bus Depot&quot; new or &quot;BustedBus&quot; used?
&gt; 
&gt; any help is appreciated, would you believe in 25+ years of owning buses
&gt; I've never had one of these fail.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
&gt; Bob
