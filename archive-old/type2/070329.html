I have been able to get quotes on smog parts from what I think is 
called &quot;Help Smog Parts&quot;, 209-636-7450.  I haven't actually bought 
anything.  They were willing to supply the small riser pipe from the 
exhaust pipe that ends in a flange to attach to the EGR filter, by 
cutting one off one they had, that impressed me.  That pipe is welded 
to the exhaust manifold. They gave me quotes for EGR valve
(dealer said no &amp; local suppliers said no), EGR filter, Catalytic 
converter (non-CA).
Anybody had dealings with these folks?

&gt;  Is this true or is this a bum steer?
