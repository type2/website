Subject: Vanagon &quot;Jail Bars&quot;?

Hey all,

Has anyone ever seen or heard of those bars that protect the rear =
windows from your luggage as you whip thru the &quot;S&quot; curves available for =
Vanagons?  A friend of mine referred to them as jail bars so I'm not =
sure of the correct term.  I know they were available on early =
transporters.
