&gt;
&gt;I sandblasted the lower edge of my 71 Westy windshield &quot;frame&quot;, and was
&gt;dismayed at all the pits and small (1-2mm) holes there.  The worst spot is a
&gt;rusty run of the holes blending together for a slot maybe 5/8&quot; long.  I've
&gt;zinc primed it all to hold the fort, but...
&gt;
&gt;I'd say there are maybe 40 holes total, lots of surface pitting most of the
&gt;way across.  The vertical flange behind the sill is fine.  The overall ledge
&gt;is worth keeping.  Short of having somebody weld over the holes, is there a
&gt;recommended patch for this, aside from the old Bondo treatment?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks much.

John...Why not think of buying your own MIG welder? They are not that
expensive. I don't know how anybody running and old vehicle could be
without one. OK....They do take a bit of getting used to but it is not
difficult.  I am currently moving anti-clockwise round my van repairing any
rust I find by cutting out the offending holes and thin metal surrounding
them with a grinder (the neighbours love me) and welding in new metal
mostly salvaged from a set of Dexion shelving. A bit of further grinding
and some body filler and its good for years. You can even give the finished
repair a good thump and it rings like the original metal (useful when
selling the van in the future).
 I am not a pro welder but  I have a lot of experience.If you need any tips
then just ask.
