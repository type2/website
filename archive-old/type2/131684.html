Subject: Re: [T2] Rotor Button? Distributor Cap?

I have taken some pics of the confusing parts I picked up the other day. I 
have now decided to give the Coil a whirl. It was only $15 and the old black 
misc. coil I have has a bubbled out bottom end. It looks bad although it 
does work. This Blue Coil I picked up is definately Mexican and i snap a few 
pics of the box that show the cross refferences. It lists several different 
cars including Combi Panel 65-87. The rotor button pics are of the 04033 and 
the 04012. I bought the 04012 first and found out it is listed for a 009 or 
094 distributor. Note the differences in the demensions. On the inside of 
the button the contact plates are different lengths, too. To view the pics 
click the link below.
