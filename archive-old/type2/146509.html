hello all,
      goethe, the two tone bullet, is once again on the fritz.  she
has to date new fuel pump, filter, afm, fuel pressure regulator, temp
sensor 2 , plugs, and wires.  she is a 75 bus auto tranny BTW.  i have
pulled the fuel tank and it was clean and also run new fuel hoses.  ah
yes also a new flamethrower coil to help my petronix ignition module.
she ran fine for about 5 days when i put on the new plug wires.  the
old high tension wire that goes from the coil to the distributer cap
had all the individual wires fused together.  also have new cap and
rotor.  what should i test next?  any one have similar experence?
