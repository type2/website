Subject: RE: [T2] still hesitating/bucking

&gt;the truck still starts &amp; idles fine.  after driving for about 20-30 
&gt;minutes,
&gt;it begins hesitating/bucking/spitting. it will also cut off at stoplights,
&gt;but always does restart.


Rebuild your carb?  Sounds like it leans out too much when warm.  Check the 
choke operation, and all sels/o-rings.  Basically;rebuild it to spec.

Eron
