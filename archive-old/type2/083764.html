Subject: Floor Insulation

Hey, guys...
I am doing the interior of my 73 westy and am trying
to figure out how much of the Bulley-Hewlett method to
include. I dont think I'm going to undercoat the floor
panel on the inside because of the risk of rust and
the unphasability of the undercoat when it comes time
to repair again. What would be a good combination of
insulation to put under the linoleum and fiberboard? I
was thinking about thin rubber mat insulation + thin
reflective insulation, then the fiberboard and
linoleum. Would this cut down on engine noise and 
heat loss substantially or would I need more? I want
removable insulation for access to the floor, but
something thin enough to fit snuggly under westy
furnature. any help is appreciated...
                                  Thanks,
                                  Paul Deatherage
