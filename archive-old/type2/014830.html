Hello lists ,,i just want to waste a bit of bandwith to thank all the people 
&gt;from the Everybus campout for coming and touring the shop and the many kind 
comments and all the praise from the group on my work ,,i would also like to 
apoligze to those who were here and i really didn't get a chance to chat with 
or answer any questions ,,if anyone has any they would like to cover please 
p-mail me i will do my best to help ,,It felt really good to look up at the 
road and see all the buses lined up along the side ,,thanks to Danny 
Morganelli for having enough wits about him to snap some pics of the ocassion 
,,neither Neil Pickett or I had that much about us ,,also Thanks to Neil for 
the help handling the questions and such that he took care of for me ,,later
