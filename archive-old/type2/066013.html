To me, it would make more sense to set an emissions threshhold, and all you
had to do was meet that, even if you had to wedgie a V8 in there.  That
would not satisfy the sales goals of the Big 3.

My XSO just went thru 6 weeks of hell trying to get her '78 BMW 530i
smogged.  The car runs clean enough, but she went thru a lot of crap because
certain wires and tubes and hoses were not correct.
