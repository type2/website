 Help!  I want to replace the bushings on the rear trailing arms (referred
to
 in Bentley's as 'diagonal arms').  The one on the right looks deformed and
 the wheel on that side has always sat just a little funny.

 But I can't find this part listed anywhere.  My Haynes manual says they
were
 vulcanized into the arm and so replacement means new arms.  But no one
sells
 new arms either.  Am I SOL or does someone know where I can get the parts?

 Thanks for any and all suggestions!
