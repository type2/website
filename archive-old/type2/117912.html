Subject: Re: [T2] h2o cooled

&gt;&lt;&lt; My only question, and if someone could help me figure it out, I would
&gt;appreciate it, is where would you put the Radiator, I figure you could use 
&gt;a
&gt;radiator cooler, but where do you put the radiator.. I want to invest in a
&gt;VW Bus, but do not like air cooled engines, I want to convert the engine
&gt;over to a jetta or scirrocco 8 valve water cooled engine. but haven't
&gt;figured out where to put the radiator.. any suggestions? Appreciate it...
&gt;

Water cooling is for computers. Works great and is quiet.

As for a bus, come on why not like an aircooled engine? Just one less thing 
to break.
