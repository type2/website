Subject: Re: FW: [T2] Zerk fitting

&lt;&lt; Anyway the

general response to the question about zerks was that they are

absolutely 1 size fits all.  I checked with three different folks

that used to fit a lot of these things and the responses were the

same.  Myself, I'm the computer guy, not the lube guy, so I'm just

passing along the info. &gt;&gt;

Ohmagawd...If this is true, could this be one of the only things on
a Bus (or anywhere, for that matter) that really does live up to
the advertised &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot;... ?-)
