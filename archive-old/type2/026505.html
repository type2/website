Subject: RE:  pressure regulator?

&gt;I just order an eletric fuel pump to replace my stupid mechanical one in 
&gt;my '72 Westy /w 1700cc Pancake engine w/ twin weber carbs.  Do I 
&gt;need a pressure regulator to keep my carbs being ruined or something?  
&gt;And a cutoff switch to stop the pump from pumping when the carb bowl 
&gt;is full?  In other words I don't know what i'm doing, what should the 
&gt;pressure be for twin (single barrel) weber carbs?Where do I get this stuff 
&gt;If I need it?  Please help me out.

Well, that all depends on the fuel pump you bought.  If it's one of those
little square Facet brand ones then you don't need anything.  It only puts
out about 3.5 psi and Webers can handle up to 5 psi.  I use a generic,
round, canister-shaped pump that I get from my local Pep-Boys for about $30
and it puts out about 4.5 psi and I've never had any trouble using it with
my dual Weber IDF's.

You can wire the fuel pump so it will only run if the engine is running, but
I don't know how.  Seems like you'd need to create a timer circuit like the
FI buses have so the pump would run for a few seconds when you first turn on
the ignition.  I saw a post about doing this with parts salvaged from a FI
VW Rabbit, but I can't find it anymore.  I just run a hot wire off of the +
side of the coil to the pump and attach the pump's ground wire to the frame.

I mounted my pump under the bus, just forward of the right axle.  You want
it to be below the bottom of your gas tank otherwise you'll run out of gas
before you run out of gas (the pumps are designed to push, not pull the
gas).
