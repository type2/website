Subject: New Alternator install problem, 1.8 liter (longish)

I ordered a remanufactured alternator for a 1.8 VW bus.  In all respects it matched, except that the + terminal posts were too long, so the outside metal cover where the vent pipe connects would not go on because the posts stuck up too much. 

I tried to screw them out and then screw them in to make them shorter, but that did not work.  I worried that if I fooled around too much the posts would come unattached down inside the alternator. 

So... I hacksawed the two positive posts down a bit (careful not to get shavings in the internal workings), and then I was able to get the cover on properly.  I also took a little plastic device (not sure what this doohickey is...) off the old Bosch alternator and connected it to one of the 2 positive posts.

I also covered the two posts with duct tape so that the cover would not short against it.

My problem: The postive red lead from the alternator is somewhere grounding out.  It is baffling as to where. 

I have taken the alternator completely out 2 times and I'm getting really tired.  

Anybody have any ideas what might be happening here, or how to proceed?

Desperate,
James
