Subject: RE: [T2] Side Mirror Removal

&gt;&gt;&gt; The proper way is to just unscrew the mirror with a wrench, like you
are doing.  &lt;&lt;&lt;

Doh, I was afraid of that. It's spinning rather easily now, but I can
see (I think I can anyway) something like a nut spinning on the inside
too. Does the mirror mount screw into a nut that's welded on the inside?
If so, I think I may have broke off that nut. 

I wonder how JB Weld would work at re-afixingthat little nut. :) 

Cheers
Chris
