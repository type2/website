Subject: Re: [T2] Heat: Atwood Bilge Blower?

Chris, your point is valid.   The bilge blower installed after HE's can suck
CO into the cabin if your HE's leak.

On other people's points and questions.  Yes the bilge blower is loud. But
you don't have to run it all the time. I have heard mention of using a Dodge
headlight dimmer for a variable speed fan but haven't tried it myself.  The
bilge blower I had on my bus would stand streamers up from the dash vents
when on.  The more you insulate your heating system the better and more hot
air you will get.  I would burn my hand if I left it over the vents for over
a minute.

But everyone don't forget.... The over the engine fan does nothing at all
above idle!!!  The system is not designed to.  A bilge blower installed here
would just waste your money once the bus is moving.  The engine fan takes
over after idle and that is your source of air.

I highly recommend a CO detector and have it installed in my bus.  Saved my
puppies lives once already...  And maybe mine one day...

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
