Subject: Some from Greensboro VW Club?

I'm looking for a name of a guy in Asheboro who drives a Yellow Crewcab.  He
had work done on it in Fayetteville.  I've lost his card and can't remember
his last name or the name of his Insulation business.  Anyone know it?

Also what's the URL for the Club's webpage?

Dave
