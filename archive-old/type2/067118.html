&gt; remember where I read that. Can someone fill me in either way?

&gt; Also, I have not had any (knock on wood) head problems,
&gt; so should I even worry about them When I have them out?
&gt; I am pretty sure that this 145,000 miles are all on the
&gt; origonal engine and heads, so I am abit weary.

&gt; Definitely do the heads.They'll be off anyway.   With 145 miles they will need it.    Peace Phil
