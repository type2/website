Subject: RE: '71 electical diagnostic terminal

I just took another look at the Bentley manual's electrical schematic.
It says that the test network was included in buses starting in January
1971, though the &quot;1971&quot; model cars had been in production since
mid-1970.

My previous bus was also a '71 (it was a passenger bus with a front
bench seat), but it didnt' have the test network terminal. It did,
however, have a few mystery wires that I suspect might have been part of
the test network.

The wiring diagram includes terminal numbers, so I know which part of
the socket goes to which bit of the electrical system. Just from looking
at it, I could see how to use it to get dwell and tach info. However,
the connections to the coil, the generator, the starter, and the
regulator suggest that there are tests that would allow me test these
components conveniently. I'm not sure what those tests would be.

Somewhere out there I know that there are specs on this. Anyone out
there have the manuals that the VW dealer mechanics used?

&gt;?? the 71's didn't have that diagnostic stuff ... it wasn't until about
&gt;late 72 or so, i think. i know the 73's DID have it. my 71 bus (non-camper)
&gt;didn't have it, anyway.
&gt;
&gt;and you do NOT want one of those machines! ;) it was about the size of a
&gt;refrigerator!! i doubt if any still exist.
