Subject: Re: HELP!!! Ignition Key Lost!!

Hi Volks,

Big thanks must go out to all those who responded to my plea earlier this
weekend. You know who you are.

Steve Sandlin gets the biggest kudo's. As proprietor of
www.steveslockshop_dot_com, he is sending me a pair of new keys now that I have
sent him the code from the tailgate lock cylinder. Good price too, the cost
for 2 pre-cut keys from him is just slightly more than buying 2 blanks from
the dealership. Much better than the vulture of a locksmith I looked up in
the yellow pages. 

Don't you just love a happy ending?

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; in an act of overwhelming ineptitude, I have lost the only key to the
&gt; Über-Kamper's ignition. &quot;Luckily&quot;, it is safe at home in the driveway at the
&gt; moment, and all of the exterior locks have been swapped with the handles from
&gt; my 73 westy, which I have a spare key for. The truck is secure, but immobile.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a 79 Transporter. I also have the ignition switch from the 73, but I
&gt; can't seem to get it out of the housing (which was removed with a hacksaw.)
&gt; 
&gt; I've looked over the archives and checked out the lock FAQ, but I don't know
&gt; where to find a take-apart diagram, and I have no Bentleys handy. The local
&gt; locksmith wants $150 to re-key the  lock, but I'd rather have it keyed to the
&gt; 73 ignition if possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestions are VERY WELCOME! I have another car, so it's a non-emergency
&gt; status at the moment.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
