Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

&gt; Didn't someone say in a previous thread that 
&gt; these vehicles can be imported legally if they pass through 
&gt; Europe?  The same goes for South African Vanagons, and 
&gt; Brazilian Type2's I believe.

If they did, they were wrong.  Even from Europe, anything less than 25
years old must meet U.S. safety and emissions standards. Period.
Mexican/Brazilian busses will not meet these standards no matter what
you do. Absolutely no legal way around this. Sorry. 

&gt; I drove a water cooled Bus on my last trip, i think the 
&gt; engine was a 1.6 Rabbit engine, or something like that.
&gt; Power was NOT great at all. The Bus had about 30k miles
&gt; and was leaking like hell, dificult to start when hot and 
&gt; backfire was a standard issue

I drove one a couple of years ago, with about 12k miles on it. It ran
great!  Tight, no rattles to speak of, and plenty of power - I actually
passed other cars at highway speeds!  I'm sure my old bus probably drove
at least as well (if a bit more slowly) when it only had 12k on the
odometer, but unfortunately I didn't own it then. :-(  I suspect that
the lack of power you experienced probably was related to the
backfiring, hard start, etc.  It probably was in dire need of a tune up
or a timing adjustment.
