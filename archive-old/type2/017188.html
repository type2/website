&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt; I've been trying to get the brass distributor gear on my 2 crankshafts,
&gt; (rebuiling a couple of 2.0l air-cooled engines) and haven't succeded yet.
&gt; 
&gt; I first tried heating the gears in oil, the second time I tried boiling
&gt; water.  But in both cases I wasn't able to slip the gear on the crank;
&gt; they &quot;froze&quot; to the crank almost immediately after they touched the
&gt; crank and I had to get out my torch and heat them up to pull them off.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody done this before, and can give me some hints as to how it's
&gt; done?
Tom:
Yup! I use an electric hot plate (Goodwill Store stuff) an aluminum pan,
and about a quart of automatic transmisson fluid; cook it till it just
starts to smoke (I'm guessing 280-300 degrees F), remove the gear from
the boiling oil carefully with a channellocks, and slide it onto the end
of the crank while aligning the keyway. I then give it a couple of smart
whacks with a dulled cold chisel and 32 oz. hammer to make sure it's
fully driven home and all the oil displaced. It will change sound as it
tightens up. You shouldn't have to hit it very hard, but be careful
where you place your chisel tip that you don't deform the gear. I should
mention that for this phase of assembly I have the crank attached to the
flywheel and sitting on the bench with its nose pointing up. I like this
method of heating parts because the oil heats the part uniformly (unlike
a flame which could change the heat treating or actually melt the
gears), and limits the temperature. I think you could use edible oils as
well and the vapors might be marginally less harmful to breath. Just
don't forget to replace that bottle of Crisco or you could be in trouble
with your domestic partner.(No problem in my house, my wife would never
miss it- I do most of the cooking.)
Of course, the really correct way is to use a press and thousands of
dollars worth of custom made press fixtures. They are really slick and a
bit quicker, but it seems I've always had other priorities.
All the normal safety precautions apply, don't burn yourself or your
shop down!
