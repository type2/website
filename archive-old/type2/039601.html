Subject: Generator dilema...

Hey everyone,

(This is my first post)
On a recent trip to California from Texas, in my 70'
Bus my generator light came on. According to my volt
meter I was running about 7 volts at 3,000 RPMs.
Seeing as it was a road trip we had a large stereo
system set up, a CB radio, a temp guage, and a
volt/tach meter. Eventually the volts dropped to 4,
and we were dead. The battery would take a full
charge, but the generator wasn't doing it's job, so we
had to travel the last 1,000 miles of our trip off of
jump starts and battery charges. We would never get
more than 8 constant volts even after full charges. Is
it possible that all of the draw from the various
sources is what blew out the generator? Now for the
larger question:Knowing the situation, should I invest
in an alternator? I'm looking forward to your replys.
Thanks,
Johnny Gardner
