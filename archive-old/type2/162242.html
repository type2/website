Subject: re: Mechanic referral

&gt; I'm going to be selling my 77 transporter to someone in the Agusta/N.
&gt; Agusta area of Georgia/South Carolina.  Does anyone know a VW mechanic
&gt; in that area I can refer him to?

You mean Augusta, right?

It's been years, but I think Darrel (probably misspelled) is still in
business.  He used to work out of a shop in his backyard, off Wrightsboro
road (toward Grovetown from 520).    Mike?  Do I have this right?


Ed Esposito out in Harlem can do VW work as well..looks like his website
is being redone though:  http://www.monkeysunclekustoms_dot_com/    Good guy,
known him for many years....though I haven't been to his shop since he got
it built.

If NOPI in Augusta still sells VW parts, they can probably point him to a
few shops as well...

...david (haven't lived in years...)
