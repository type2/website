Subject: Any pop tops available in DC area?

     So with all the information from the list I have decided to convert my 
sunroof bus into a camper with a pop top.  Now I just have to get a pop top! 
  I got a couple of offers from people as a response to my thread asking 
about the conversion, which I appreciate.  They were too far away for me to 
come and get though.  I am looking either for one in the area that I can 
come and get, or for somebody who can and will ship it to me.  If you have a 
68-72 pop top you can hook me up with, please let me know how much 
(including shipping, if needed) and what condition it is in.  Ideally, I'd 
like the whole she-bang including all fasteners and components, but will 
take the best of what I can get.

Thanks,
Jaybird
