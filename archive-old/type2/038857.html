I sell the brand new Mexican factory long block for 1250.00 plus shipping,
so far the most expensive shipping was to the east coast of Texas 110.00, so
for less then 1400.00 you can have a brand new longblock, I personally have
over 24000 miles on the one in my double door and have customers with over
50,000 documented miles without a problem, the choice is yours.

For those who remember my disaster last week and the subsequent firestorm I 
created with my initial posting, I'll tell you where I am and ask some
advice 
on which way to turn. The details of the problems with the other engine will

remain between the mechanic, the seller, and me, but here's the deal.
Option 1. Rebuild existing 1600 upright- estimate $1572.00
Option 2. Buy already rebuilt 1600 (I think he called it a short block, so 
would someone explain why its called that?) for  $1760.00
Option 3. Install brand new (long block?) for $1650.00
My questions are:
Why would I do a rebuild by them which is the longest time in the shop,(and 
remember I only drove my new toy 80 miles before disaster) if I can come up 
with a couple hundred more dolllars and have a new one installed? The only 
reason I can come up with would be originality, but I found out from
mechanic 
that this engine was a '71 in a '70 anyway.
How can a new engine be a hundred bucks or so cheaper than a rebuild, and so

why would I buy a rebuild? He said something about it possibly being the 
exchange rate because the total rebuild comes from overseas. I guess this is

possible.
Are there different makes of &quot;new engines&quot; and if so, should I post the 
brand(assuming that's the way to go) so I can get some feedback on brand?
I can pack a lot of questions into one posting can't I? Please feel free to 
comment on all or none, and thanks again for helping a newbie on a &quot;major
but 
determined uphill learning curve&quot;!
