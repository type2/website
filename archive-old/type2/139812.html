&gt; I was offered a BA-6 gas heater a week ago at an insanely inexpensive

&gt;
&gt; What do y'all think? Do I need to upgrade the alternator if I install
&gt; the BA-6?

I have a BA-4 not sure how much differences there are in power draw, but
in really bad weather when I have heater on, headlights on, wipers going
and maybe my aux defroster fan I will draw down my battery a little, don't
even dare turn on radio as I am running real close to the alt limit.
under those circumstances I usually try to turn off something occasionally
if possible, or take a break with thinngs turned off and engine at fast
idle.

&gt; I think Richard or someone else mentioned the NLA status of the 70 amp
&gt; alternators earlier this week. Does anyone have a source for 70 amp
&gt; alternators at which I can be pointed?

been trying to find one for years,  have heard of folks grafting on other
alterators but nothing that looks workable for me,

I have a 78 auto tranny bus.
