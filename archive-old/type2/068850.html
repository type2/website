Subject: oiling systems, inverted running.

        Model airplane engines DO have an oiling system- they're
conventional 2 strokes with oil mixed into the fuel. 5-20% depending
on the kind of engine and hotness of the fuel. Conventional 2 strokes
use oil-fuel mix fed through the crankcase and the oil-mist lubricates
the bottom end.

        An airplane engine doesn't automatically work upside down. Any
engine can be rigged to run upside down or at other interesting angles.
Airplane engines are typically rated in how long they can be run upside
down (Remember that g forces are always 'down' in a loop- except
perhaps at the very top for just a moment. Ditto a barrel roll.) Inverted
flight means the airplane is upside down but otherwise flying straight
and level. For example. I believe the Cessna 152 I once took an aerobatic
ride in was good for 30 seconds inverted. We did loops, rolls, etc.
A Christen Eagle or Sukhoi sport plane engine might be rated for
continious inverted operation, or might be limited to 1 minute, or 
might be good for continious inverted running.

        The issue for running upside down is getting oil into the
oil pump. With a cunning baffle and flapper arangement, a wet-sump
motor like our VW can probably run a many seconds inverted. Then
you have to turn it over again to allow the oil to run back into
the cunning baffle and flapper deal. But even with a dry sump,
the oil system has to be set-up to get oil to the pump somehow.
An engine with a 30 second inverted rating might well be dry-sump.

        Stock VW uses a 'wet sump' meaning the oil tank is at the bottom 
of the engine and the oil pump draws from there to supply the cooler and 
thence the main bearings, etc. 

        Porsche aircooled 6s are 'dry sump' meaning a scavenging pump 
collects oil at the bottom of the engine and passes it (with a lot of air) 
to an oil tank where the oil and air separate. A second pump draws from 
the tank, to the cooler and then to the main bearings, etc. On some
911s the oil-filter screws onto the oil tank.

        A VW can be converted to dry-sump by serious modification-
the oil-pump-intake has to be connected to the external oil tank
and some sort of scavenge pump installed to collect all the oil
that falls into the sump and send it to the tank.

        Once the oil is in the tank, you've still got to get
it to oil-pump. Note that running in free-fall is harder than
inverted OR right-side-up OR sideways, since gravity in SOME
direction is great for separating oil and air, and getting
the oil ready to flow into a tube.

        For racing, type IVs in 914s are often fitted with
a little cup in place of the drain plate, and an extended oil-pickup
tube. This little cup holds enough oil to get through the really tight
part of the fast turn, where g forces have piled up all the rest of 
the engine oil along once side of the case. Turn hard enough, long
enough, and your wet-sump oil pump will starve and the oil pressure
light will come on.

        All this make sense?
