Subject: Pertronix ignitor an other stuff

Well,
   First off, if you have a mech. dizzy your pertronix kit should
be a module mounted on a full ring. If vacum advance then it looks
like a half moon and has two plates. One is held to the advance plate
with a
flat head screw which uses the same mount hole as your points. This
plate has two threaded posts which the second plate fits down on,,this
second plate has the module mounted to it the one post is a pivot point
and the other has a slot for your gap adjustment.
  Awhile ago I had to have my carbs adjusted while on the sensor so
gunter
could pass emmisions. The Mech. leaned out the  carb(s). and all was
well.
I had noticed the ground cable needed to be fixed inside the dizzy,,so I
did
before it failed. 1/2 mile down the road it was dead. I must have not
gapped the 
pertronix or it slipped and was rubbing on the doughnut. Anyway, I stuck
the
points in and as soon as I could I went over to  friends and re-timed
it. Now
under load it hesitated. In the meantime my new pertronix
comes,,,,,,wrong
one! Ahhhggg! Tried to regap the points and static time it and it was
worse!
Tried again and wont even fire! Called pertronix and the told me that
the
Autovice Bow Wow in lake city sells their device, so I call them. Sure,
bring
it up and we will exchange it. (was never installed). Installed the
pertronix,
(also bought a new coil just in case) and it fired right up. By this
time my
neighbor had noticed me buried in the back and comes down to talk, Sure
he
has a timeing light,,,,timed it with a light and runs fine again.
  I suspect the condenser was flakey then failed as this is the only
component
that isnt being used now. It had me convienced that I was doing
something
wrong! Though I must admit, me and points have never realy gotten along
all
that well, I should have at least gotten it running!
  Does this sound like a flakey condenser?  BTW I did notice that after
the
carbs were adjusted for emmisions that I had lost some pickup. what do
you all think?
