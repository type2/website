Subject: RE: [T2] 74 exhaust on a 79?

&gt; I see in the Bus Depot catalog that a 74 system will work, but w/ no
converter.
&gt; I'm wondering- like me with ordinary hand tools bolt 74 exhaust right on?
&gt; Without a torch or a welder?

&gt; I 'see' you have 2 list replies but neither mentioned the exhaust ports.
&gt; Does your 79 have square ports? Or oval ports?
&gt; If you have oval ports, yes you can use 72-74 heater boxes.
&gt; You cannot bolt 72-74 oval port boxes to square port heads.


Yes, but if I understand correctly that he is going to keep his existing '79
heat exchangers (and just replace the exhaust system behind it), then that
is a moot point. The '72-74 exhaust is a direct bolt-on to the '79 heat
exchangers, no modification needed. In fact, in most of the rest of the
world it is what came stock on a '79; only we lucky U.S. folk got the funky
exhaust setup with a CAT.  As to whether it can be done with regular tools,
no torch, etc., in a perfect world, yes.  That is, if you don't come across
any frozen/rusted bolts that need to be heated, if your heat exchangers are
not slightly tweaked or bent (making reinstallation more difficult once you
remove the old exhaust and what's left &quot;springs open or closed&quot; slightly),
etc. The '72-74 setup will actually bolt up to a '79 more easily than a U.S.
'79 setup does, because it is a much simpler configuration.  But one frozen
bolt can ruin your whole day, so allow some extra time.
