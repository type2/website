Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 Thermostat

What John describes is hardly baling wire and duct tape. I'm glad your
dealer has them, mine does not. John is offering a simple replacement for
those of us not as blessed as you. Lighten up, unless it a concours
restoration who would care about the conversion. I hope you don't get stuck
out in the middle of nowhere, you might have to use duct tape and wire
sometime unless your dealer delivers to ButtHead Montana on a Sunday night
at 10:00 PM.

&gt; John,
&gt;
&gt; Rube is a conglomerate of the hokey pokey concept------
&gt;
&gt; If it ain't made for it, I suppose bailing wire and duct tape will
&gt; do-----
&gt;
&gt; I have the correct one, got it in two day's from VW, and it fit without
&gt; any Polish inginuity, and when I inquired about a type IV thermostat
&gt; shortage, the parts manager replied---&quot; How many do you want?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; With this in mind, why screw around with an incorrect part?
&gt;
&gt; I live north of the Mason Dixon line----
&gt;
&gt; No Rube for me, thanks anyway.:&gt;)
&gt;
&gt; Later,
