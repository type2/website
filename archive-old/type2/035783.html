Has anyone experimented with using strippable sealant (usually called caulk)
to seal the jalousie windows snug in the cold weather?  I bet it would stop
the rattling, I bet.  Now, don't be a dufuss like me and try it until you
check to see if it eats aluminum, but it seems like a good idea to me.  It
works great on residential windows and in the spring you just peel it away.
