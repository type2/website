Subject: Re: [T2] painting the tin (color other than black)

Hello Guys   Think about this the Porsche 356C and 912 motors came with a 
grey fan shroud  all other tin was black. This was done so that you could tell 
what motor it was just by looking at the color of the shroud .  At Naturalbus 
last year we gave away a motor that we had painted tyed-dyed , it looked way too 
cool. I don't think the color of the tin would have too much bearing on the 
heat but I do know that those chrome tin will make a motor run hot but this 
could be cause most of them are made in Twain and don't fit worth a damn .  Later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va
