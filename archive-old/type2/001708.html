Subject: Who's running Dellorto 40mm's?
Date: Tue, 29 May 2001 22:46:21 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Anyone running 40mm Dellortos' on there Type4 motor, mainly 1700?  I bought
a set that was on a Bus in the junkyard. I'd like to compare jet size with
one that is running and is not causing any problems.  I've had the Motor
running on the bench with a 2 barrel Weber and it Run fine. With the
Dellorto's is would idle but stumbles when accelerated.  Need to add a
rebuilt kit and fine someone who can rebuilt them in the area.

Dave
