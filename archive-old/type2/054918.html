Out here in rural America, EVERY pickup has a hi-lift in it (including mine). 
Great tool.  The only problems that I foresee are; where do you keep the
bloody thing and how do you use it on a bus.  It weighs about fifty lbs. It's
four and a half feet long and it's basically a king-sized bumper jack.  If I
get in a situation where I need it, I'll come back home, get the 4x4 pickup
with the winch and pull it out of where ever it's stuck.  No place to hook it
w/o damaging something and you would NOT want it laying around loose in the
back of the bus.

Just MHO.
