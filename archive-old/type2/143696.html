Subject: exhaust sound

Hi again,

  Still trying to get my 1974 bus to make the trip
home from college.... While I am still trying to
figure out if my vacume can is good or bad, one thing
i am noticing is that there seems to be a constant
repeated pop sound coming from the exhuast pipe that
changes intensity when i adust timing.     It never
goes completely away.  Almost like the exhaust valve
is a little open when the combustion occurs. What
needs to be adjusted?  

I recently adjusted my valves, but I double checked
them so i think they are adjusted properely.  I
followed the Muir instructions.

Thanks,
Jason
