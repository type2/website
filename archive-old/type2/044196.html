Subject: [T2] Need info on 1972 bus...

I have the opportunity to buy a 1972 bus.  It's not a camper, in fact, it's
pretty bare bones.  But it runs and seems to have a solid body.

Trouble I'm having is that I know nothing about type 2's, having only owned
a 1974 Super Beetle a few years while in college.

Any comments would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Rob Blumel
