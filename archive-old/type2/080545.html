Subject: starting issues.... part two

Hello again,

Thanks to all that helped with my CV/axle questions, the new one is in and
the process went smoothly...

back to the starting issues though (when it rains.....)

I got a battery charger, and the battery is plenty full of juice. Once it
was ready, I fired it right up on the first try. We'll see if it recharges,
or if it just runs dead again. After finally getting all of this taken care
of and figured out late saturday night, I let it sit till this morning when
I needed to go to work.

Wouldn't you know, now it won't fire. =(

It'll turn and turn and turn some more, but nada. Checked plug connections,
vaccuum connections, there is gas, i have oil pressure as well as a proper
amount of oil, but nothing. I just cannot get it to fire suddenly. I have
never had this problem with this bus thus far, and only after charging the
battery as well as starting it up and driving it around the block (after
replacing the CV/axle) - NOW it won't fire.

I really am stumped now, mostly because I can't figure what could have gone
wrong sitting there in the driveway from the last time I checked it, to now.
In fact the only thing that has been touched on it since saturday evening
when I checked it out was that I threw the charger on the second deep cycle
battery just so it was full as well. I guess I should run and get some plugs
maybe, maybe some points and work on all that when I get home, but the westy
really is starting to complain. Ive had this bus since March of last year
roughly and now it suddenly decided to start being a brat.

any tips/suggestions appreciatted....

&gt; Check the alternator output voltage.  It has to be higher than the battery
&gt; voltage to charge (measure battery with key off-measure alternator output
&gt; with engine running, ideally a little bit above idle)
&gt;
&gt; 1) alternator voltage low
&gt;
&gt; disconnect battery FIRST, before working on alternator.
&gt;
&gt; First step is to check brushes (length-see manual).  If
&gt; brushes are short buy new brushes and replace the ones in your regulator.
&gt;
&gt; If brushes look ok try another regulator-pick and pull has hundreds of
&gt; Bosch alternators in the euro car section, you should be able to find a
&gt; suitable regulator if you check the numbers.  If you get a sample to test
&gt; in your system you will find out if it is the regulator.  If the original
&gt; one is bad by all means get a new one at the FLAPS or your supplier of
&gt; choice.
&gt;
&gt; Checking and replacing the diodes is a bit more advanced but still within
&gt; reach.  For a first timer It is probably cheaper to get a replacement from
&gt; pick and pull. If you get the unit apart for any reason at least inject
&gt; some new grease into the bearings (syringe needle past/through the seal)
&gt; even if you don't strip them and R(efurbish) OR R(eplace).  In my
&gt; experience replacing the brushes before they start arcing and relubing the
&gt; bearings before they dry out/rust will keep alternators going essentially
&gt; indefinitely.  45 minutes every ten years should do it.
&gt;
&gt; 2) alternator voltage good
&gt;  check wiring using manual
&gt;
&gt; PS If anyone has a good online reference for decoding the &quot;Bosch type&quot;
&gt; all-in-one regulator part numbers would they please post it. There seem to
&gt; be a lot of regulator part numbers but only few basic sizes of
&gt; alternators. Thanks. jon
