Subject: Need Timing Help

OK, here's the situation. My '76 Westy has a 1.8L running a single Weber 
carb. The engine code is an ED, which indicates it should be FI, but that was 
chucked some time ago by a PO. And, of course, it should be a 2.0L in there, 
not a 1.8. If I set the timing between 7 to 12 degrees BTDC, the engine idles 
well, makes good power, but runs very hot. If I advance it further, it idles 
higher, of course, but it also stumbles and hesitates, but runs cooler. Any 
suggestions on where the timing should be set? Also, before the FI gurus jump 
on me about the carb, Everybus 2000 will be this engines last trip. I have a 
'76 2.0 FI engine that's going in it in late April/early May. I just don't 
have the time to swap engines before Everybus, but I also don't want to melt 
this one on the trip. I know there are others out there running similar 
setups. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.   Thanks, Jeff S.
