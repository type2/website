Subject: Re: [T2] New bus report: Must be busma

Hi Andrew,

Well, I certainly did well by a generous list-member. Matt D. of NH offered
up a Free 1979 passenger bus in February last year, and it has brought my
family much joy. 

I will grant that to practically ANYONE else it would not have been worth
saving, but for me it was PeRFECT. I Had a 1973 Rustfalia with strong
drive-train and good interior, but a chassis that was rapidly reducing
itself to a crunchy brown powder. Matt had a 79 7-passenger bus with poor
cosmetics, no drivetrain and no interior. It also had a solid frame and no
bondo whatsoever.  He'd tried to sell it for months with no interest, then
he gave up and offered it to the list for free. Getting it home and on the
road cost less than $600 US$, which gave put the family in a day camper
(no-pop-top) all last summer. Over the winter I put a 74 pop-top (also &quot;Free
to a good Home&quot; -- Thanks Denmeister!) on it along with used canvas and had
it repainted at Maaco. for another $300 or so.

It is true that two buses did go to the crusher in the making of this
story... but they were doomed from the get-go.  The &quot;Westfakia&quot; has a couple
hundred hours invested, but everyone need a hobby. The bus was a big hit
wherever it went this summer, and even took home a special merit award at
the Kitchener-Waterloo Bug-Out.

I wouldn't swap my current bus for anything else on the road -- it's got my
fingerprints all over it. And it really makes you smile when complete
strangers come over and pose to get their picture taken with your bus.

As always, YMMV. I believe this thread came up not long after Matt offered
the bus, and one wit said that no-one could afford a free bus.

RULES ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN!!!!

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Looks like you did well for yourself, Jeff.
&gt; Maybe it was worth the money.
&gt; In my experience buses that are &quot;free&quot; generally don't
&gt; stay &quot;free&quot;.
&gt; In fact they generally are only good to be freed of
&gt; all useful parts then sent to bus heaven.
&gt; Keep us informed on your successes &amp; adventures.
