Subject: Re: [T2] looking for THIS hose - see pic

&lt;&lt; Hmmm.. Do you think that this is a job for duct tape? Friction tape would

probably do better in the warm engine compartment and it would look more

&quot;stock&quot; if you did a good job. You could mummify that hose and if necessary

put some big hose clamps on the end so they seal well.. I'm facing the same

problem, more or less. And NONE of those big overhead hoses are available

anymore. &gt;&gt;

A larger electrical supply house would carry large sizes of heat shrink 
tubing.
&quot;Should&quot; work better than tape, since it wouldn't have any seams...
