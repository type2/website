Subject: Re: [T2] Odessa Buses?

The event in question is likely &quot;Playa del Fuego&quot; (see http://www.playadelfuego_dot_org/ ) - it's not a bus-specific event, but I'm sure there will be busses there.

I have a couple of spare tickets if anyone is in need, and know of others with tickets.

Cheers,
    Avocado Tom
    Look for the white '67 with the big wood roof rack
