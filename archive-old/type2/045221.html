Subject: [T2] rebuilt engine won't start - UPDATE -

hey list,

today i had my first AIRS experience. I called up Stefan Ufer this afternoon
and he came and took a look at my bus that with rebuilt engine that won't
start.

Yes the distributor drive gear is in staright. yes the timing is set. we
tried moving the dizzy around while cranking to see if it caught. it didn't.
we pulled a valve cover off and cranked it and stefan said that the rocker
arms were barely moving, and concluded that my hydraulic lifters needed to
be bled. his prescription was to first try cranking it a lot until the oil
light went out or the battery went dead. repeat as necesary to acheive oil
pressure. if that doesn't work, take off the rockers, pushrods, pushrod
tubes, and lifters and bench bleed them. not hard but very time consuming.
if THAT doesn't work i've got bigger problems.

So i've been cranking and cranking until the battery goes dead 3 or 4 times
now. the battery's starting to go dead faster now. the battery is less than
1 year old. oil light still stays on, engine doesn't run at all, but fires
every now and then. argh

any 2nd opinions. thanks guys for all the responses. I love this list and
everybody on it :)

Peace,
