&gt;you could bring it in the country as long as you were a
&gt;Mexican citizen and the bus was registered in Mexico...
&gt;She had offered it for sale in the states,

There was a VW Sharan(euro minivan) TDI for sale for $13K in FL at a
salvage yard that caused great excitement on the TDI list a few months
back. The only thing wrong with it was you couldn't actually drive it on US
roads. The theory was that some German national had brought it over while
working a temporary position and then sold it instead of shipping it back,
since the model is not sold in any of the Americas.

I also would be interested in the nose and radiator assembly from a mexibus
for my future TDI powered bay bus. Twice the power and twice the MPG has a
certain appeal :-)
