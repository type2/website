Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Dipstick heater

Hello Guys    You know the last bunch of posts I have sent to the type 2 list 
never show up. It seems that they only go to certain people .  I don't have 
any idea as to what the deal is!   But what I use to do with my bus in real 
cold weather was to drain the oil at night and put it behind the wood stove to 
keep warm and in the morning pour the warm oil back into the motor before 
starting  duh.          never failed to start even with a 6 volt battery. when it 
got real cold I'd take the battery inside with the oil.   later and have fun  
Mark dearing   ps  I'm still wondering about why my posts haven't been on the 
list.
