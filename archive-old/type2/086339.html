Subject: 2L in a 71?

Folks,

I'll be rebuilding or replacing the motor in my '71 Westy this summer. After
thinking about this for some time, a friend suggested I go with a 2L, fuel
injected motor. I'm looking for more torque and HP, and drive lots of
freeway miles and want to tow a motorcycle next year.

Will a 2L FI motor fit/work in my Westy?
Am I looking for more trouble than its worth?

I'm not one to worry about keeping things original, but I will keep my
stocker for rebuild to original specs. Its a good motor with 169k miles, but
getting a wee bit tired.

Thanks,
Pete
