Subject: Bed liner question

Any users out there know a release agent for bedliner? I'm thinking
of coating some parts of my bus with a thick layer of the stuff but
want it removable afterwards...In particular, I'd like to try and &quot;make&quot;
replacement rubber mats for the front seat area that are thicker and
hopefully quieter and longer lasting than the mats there now...If that 
works, there are other areas of the bus that could use new matting...
