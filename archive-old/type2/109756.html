Subject: testing altenator

I was driving down the road in our bus that we just finished restoring, 1972. 
we have been driving for a day and the bus quit, so Ichecked the wiring to th 
battery looked good but battery was dead, figured the altenator must  not be 
charging, how can you check these, or will the regulator being bad cause the 
altenator not to charge the battery, also can these be bench tested cause I  
have another one that I could use. thanks
