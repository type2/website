I sure think it is on... no reason why it wouldn't be.

Here is a Type 181 page, but the best info I found on the Internet.
http://www.orcalink_dot_com/~things/K98/

The actual &quot;VolksFest&quot; is both Saturday and Sunday, WetWesties (check
http://www.vanagon_dot_com/ ) are planning a camp Saturday night ...

Don't get confused by he Thing group, which is having their gather on Sunday
(a subset of the two day event for all VW fans).

I've never been, and was ready to go -- even camp, but the CrewCabSearch is
conflicting...  Never know, might make it.

Can anyone confirm the existence of a meet this weekend in Yakima WA?
Seems like I saw an announcement on the Bow Wow webpage, but haven't heard
anything about it?  Would it be worth going to, or not?

Cheers,
