Hi Volks,

Riddle me this Batman:

I've got a nasty oil leak in the rear end of my '78 Westy's engine. I've 
got nowhere to work on my bus this year, so I'm relying on a mechanic for 
major work.    :-/

He tells me my rear main oil seal is fine. He says I've got positive 
pressure in my crankcase that is blowing my dipstick up and blowing oil 
out of the dipstick hole. Then it runs down into the fan and gets slung 
all over everywhere. When I run the engine and look, this appears to be 
the case.

I had a kink in my crankcase rebreather hose. Hoping it would really be 
that easy, I replaced the hose with one very kindly provided by a fellow 
listee- and my leak just got worse.

Mechanic says I've got exhaust blowing by rings in at least one cylinder 
and the answer is a ring job. ($20 parts and $500 labor). But I just did 
a compression test and I've got 130psi+ all around. 

He says I could have blowby anyway and only a leakdown test would reveal 
it. So my questions for the list:

1- How is a leakdown test different from a crompression test? What do you 
need to do it?

2- Could I really be having enough blowby to cause this bad oil leak and 
still have a nice, strong compression test result?

Please let me know what y'all think. I need to fix this in about the next 
two weeks before I take a longish trip in the bus with my luvin' wife and 
kidlet.

Thanks,
Surfer Bob
