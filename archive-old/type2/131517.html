Subject: RE: [T2] testing engine out of bus questions (asap)

&gt;From: &quot;KYLE LAFERRIERE&quot; &lt;

&gt;I'm trying to test a 78 FI engine out of the bus and have a couple 
&gt;questions.



I reread your post soryy but I guess the previous post will help you out 
more. But &quot;out of the bus&quot; poses more problems. Put the weber on it and do 
it that way if it is truely &quot;out of the bus&quot; testing.


-You would have to pull the ECU/brain and connect it.
-The relay would have to plugged into the two white sockets, remove from the 
firewall unless you have a good spare and ground it to the engine or bell 
housing.
-FI Fuel pump will be needed and you could wire just following the Bentley, 
proper wires to the relay and ground.
- While you are doing that you need a wire from the solenoid on the starter 
to the relay. Also one from the coil to the relay.
-Then just go through the hose connections and plug &amp; patch to make them all 
work or terminate apropriately.
-Fuel supply(gas can) will need two hoses one to the fuel pump and one to 
the pressure regulator.


If I missed anything I am sure others can chime in and hit the problem spots 
on this type of testing &quot;out of the bus&quot; on a FI Type IV engine.



Good luck, take pics, drive safe, drink milk,
