Subject: [T2] can't get carb to idle below 1700 RPM

Hey all,
I have a friend with a problem and thought someone out there might know.
Please respond directly to HIM as he is not currently a type2 list member.

TIA
Snoopy

&gt; I don't know who else to ask, but do we have someone we can talk (write)
&gt; to when we're having a small problem with the bus? I just put a brand
&gt; new carb. on and can't get it to idle below 1700 RPM. It's a 34pict-3 on
&gt; a 1600 with dual heads. I'm about bald headed now trying to figure it
&gt; out. If you do or don't thanks anyway.
