Subject: Orange Camper On Rt. 123 In N. Va.?

On my way to work I sometimes see an orange camper heading west on Rt. 123 in Tysons Corner,right by Tysons mall. Is this someone on the list? If you see a guy in a white Dodge Dakota pickup waving, thats me ( hey, its a company car, they pay gas,ins., maint. etc, while my Westy gets to stay home)    Jeff
