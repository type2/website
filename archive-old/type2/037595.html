Subject: stickers?

Admins,

I can't remember who offered it, but a few months ago, someone said that the
first group of of folks to donate to the type2 cause would get one of the old
list stickers.

I don't care, really - i'm happy to provide real monetary support for this
list and my check was in the mail before anything was said about the sticker,
but i got all stoked about getting one and just figured i'd ask.

Any info appreciated,

clark gordon
