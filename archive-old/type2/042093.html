Subject: Re: Pulling ot the right when braking

I would imagine you have a sticking wheel cylinder on the opposite side, but just
marginal enough that once it gets sliding it doesn't catch anymore.

&gt; I have an interesting thing that occurs with my 70' Dormobile. When I apply

&gt; sits for hours. Any ideas? I've searched the library and archives but didn't
&gt; find anything.
