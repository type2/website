Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Diesel in a Bay

some have done Rotary in bays,  but ther weight of a bay and low amount
of low end torque don't mix as well.. 
same for a rotary in a baja.. but a rotary in a street beetle or ghia
is a dream..

A buddy of mine threw in an rotary engine in his 68
bug, wondering if its doable on a bus.
