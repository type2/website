RE: Wave&lt;&lt;This is the same phenomna with the new VW crowd--no loyalty--wh=
o
cares--I'm getting to where I have got to go , and that's it.
No Marque recognition---just plain old transportation--&gt;&gt;&gt;
This is the sort of thinking that grinds my gears...As a guy who has owne=
d a 1968 Beetle, a 1964 Beetle, a 1975 Bus, a 1975 Rabbit along with two =
1980 Rabbits, a 1973 Super Beetle, a 1973 Squareback, a 1971 Beetle, a 19=
73 Ghia, a 1978 Bus and now a 2002 Beetle, all I can say is that the most=
 'waves' I ever got was while driving either of my Buses. All those Beetl=
es, and I can honestly say I got more waves when I drove my 1990 Jeep. =20
I think that VW owners, while loyal, are sometimes not as friendly as we =
think we are. How many times has anyone gone to a Bug Show only to see ot=
hers (or worse, they have done this) looked down their noses at anyone wi=
th a water cooled VW? And with the new Beetle showing up at these shows, =
I can only imagine what reaction they get from the air cooled car group. =20
I love VW's. I think that by and far they are the best engineered cars ev=
er. However, if they are going to continue into the 21st century with the=
 same kind of fan appreciation that they did the last 50 years, the owner=
s today need to embrace the new Beetles, the new (soon) Micro Bus (even w=
ith my misgivings) and the Water Cooled group (you know, the Jettas et al=
l)...
Maybe modern owners don't appreciate the History of the company, so they =
don't wave. Or maybe the modern owner does not wave because none of the '=
old guard' don't offer a wave first. =20
TJ, who waves while driving his Bus or Beetle. Call him Hopeless if you w=
