Subject: Re: 110 city power

Dave,

My '77 Westy had the same problem that popped up at Everybus. The city power
would not run the fridge, but I noticed that if I turned the battery charger
knob, the fridge power light then came on. I traced the electricals and found
that the fuse in the back of my AC/DC converter under the bench seat was blown.
I pulled the wooden cover, and pulled up the converter. There is a door on the
back of the converter and a fuse inside. Hope this helps.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; I have been reading this list for a few months now and I feel am have
&gt; acquired a lot of info from reading other posts that have been directly
&gt; relative to me and my newly acquired '77 Westy.  This is my first post on
&gt; this list and I would like to thank you in advance for all of the
&gt; information I have/will gain from each of you.   I have a problem with my
&gt; city power connection where my stove and fridge don't seem to work when I am
&gt; hooked up to power from my house.  The PO said the city power connections
&gt; worked fine but I have had no such luck.  Is there more to the set up than
&gt; just hooking up the power cord and putting the switch on &quot;city Power&quot;
&gt; setting?  The bus is equipped with genuine westfalia parts and I feel like
&gt; it may just be user error.  Am I missing something obvious?  Thanks for the
&gt; help.
