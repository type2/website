&gt; Heh, anyone remember in Back to the Future - Part 1, the Iraqis came after
&gt; the Doc because he had stolen plutonium from them? They found him in the
&gt; parking lot of JC Penny's and they were chasing after him with a moon-roof
&gt; Volkswagen &quot;Bay Window&quot; Bus. The guy was sticking out the top with a rocket
&gt; launcher

Just for the record It was the Libyans.
