Subject: BOWLING GREEN, KY

Are there any list members near this town?

I am heading that way this week and would like to hook up if possible.

If you write back after Sunday morning give me a call anytime this week at
the Hotel 6 in Bowling Green.  I have no idea of what the number is or what
room I will be in, but I will be there starting tomorrow evening, &quot;Lord
willin and the creek don't rise&quot;.

Gimme a call, we can hook up, have some chow, and talk busses and such.
