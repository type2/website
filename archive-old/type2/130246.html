Tom, you need very few tools to assemble a VW engine. On the outside you
need a small flatblade and large flat blad and philips screw driver,
8mm, 10mm, 11mm, 13mm, 14mm, 15mm, 17mm 19mm wrenches. Sockets are a
deepwell 10mm and 13mm, regular 10mm, 13mm, 14mm, 15mm, 17mm, 19mm, and
a 21mm. Torque wrench can be a 3/8&quot; beam type with a 1&quot; extension. The
big one is the hardened 36mm for the gland nut. I use a 3/4&quot; drive
breaker bar and socket. I have found that over the years that the number
of 1/2&quot; drive sockets and breaker bars I have broke cost more than the
3/4 parts. Also a .006 feeler gage and a dime to set deck height.

If the bearing saddles on the case halves are scratched that isn't any
problem as long as there are no ridges to the scratches. If the bearings
themselves where they mate to the crank and rod surface is scratched,
toss them out and get new ones because you don't want to have to get
back into your engine in the next 30K miles.

There was a nifty homebuilt rod balancer in the &quot;how to keep your
Corvair alive&quot;. If you look in the Wilsons book and the VW interchange
manual it will show you the areas on the rod you can safely grind off.

pick up some tools I needed (with mixed success).

Couple Questions though:

1) I need to balance the rods end for end, right?  Each end should be
roughly the same weight (+/- 0.5 g) as the others?

2) I looked at my main bearing seats and there are a couple of scratches

on the surface.

3) Do I need to plastigage the clearance on my main crank bearings
(given
that I'll be trying to remove these scratches!),

Thanks!

	Tom
