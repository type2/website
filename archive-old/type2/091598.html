Subject: Re: [T2] Need exhaust manifold advice

&gt; visible flames to come out at the place where the
&gt; header mates with the 
&gt; underside of the head. And it is LOUD.  I tried
&gt; tightening the two nuts on 
&gt; the studs at that cylinder, but it didn't help, and
&gt; I was afraid to go any 
&gt; tighter because I think there is aluminum alloy up
&gt; in there somewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I have to replace that header, or can I take it
&gt; off and devise/find/buy 
&gt; a gasket of some kind that will seal up that space? 
------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Sounds like that header might be warped and not
pulling up to the head, the longer you run it, the
bigger chance you have of trenching the head, take the
header off and inspect the head to make sure it is not
damaged. Try another header with a new gasket and see
if it will seal. If it has trenched the head you might
try JB weld to seal the cut. Phil
