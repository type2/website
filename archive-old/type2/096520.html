Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump, do I need one?

Jay,

No fuel pump, pretty much *no go*.

Gravity feed is only of interest during a fire.  Repalce your fuel lines 
now!

Air cleaners are pretty important also...75% more wear or more with no
air cleaners...try breathing during a dust storm...you get the idea....
and your engine &quot;breathes&quot; a lot morethan you do.

You can buy air cleaners for each carb at your
Friendly Local Auto Parts Store, or vwflaps.

Measure the outside diameter of the carb top first.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; A question for the wise,
&gt;      I have a 74' bus, with a carbureted 2 liter 79' engine in it.  Somebody 
&gt; has mounted a fuel pump on the top of the engine.  Do I really need a fuel 
&gt; pump?  I thought the carbs were fed by gravity?  Hence, the never ending 
&gt; fires in the engine bay if something goes wrong.  It's kind of in the way of 
&gt; putting an air cleaner in there too.  Of course, so is the carb linkage.  I 
&gt; got an air cleaner that was originally for a 74' not knowing I had a 79' 
&gt; engine, can I make that work anyway?  the bus runs great as is with the fuel 
&gt; pump on it, incidentally.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's some pictures, the one on the tip right of this page is the fuel 
&gt; pump.  Click the little picture to see the bigger version of the picture:
