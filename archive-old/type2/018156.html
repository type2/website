Subject: Scoob's never ending dizzy story..
Message-ID: &lt;3749D65E.3AF79747_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Well today was suppose to be the start day, but...

So I go out and pull the 009 out, I search a bit more on the archives
and talked a bit with a couple of people.  I found in general the the
stock dizzy is pretty damn reliable, so I decided to take a closer look
at my original that I was told was shot.  I tried the little suck on the
vacuum tube test, and the &quot;thing&quot; turns just like it is suppose to.  I
take a look at the points, and find they were never changed, they are
pitted and shot.  

So I think to myself, how the hell did the mechanic find out there was
no advance?  He had not yet replaced the points, so why was he setting
the timing?  And if the points are pretty bad, then to me it would make
sense that the advance would be less than adequate, as the points would
stay open.  So I decided to get some new points and condenser, and put
the old dizzy back in and see what happens.

That is where I am at, but I am having a hard time getting the initial
timing set.  I have done the static method to get it to the general
area.  But I do not have enough idle to keep it running between the time
I start and run around to the back to make adjustments.  I have turned
the idle screw, and it does not seem to make much difference.  I am beat
tired and probably not thinking it all the way through.  Help...

How do I get the timing set without setting the idle, which would seem
to be based upon having the timing set...

Thanks,
Scoob
