Jason -

FWIW, I have a 1915 DP in the back of my '69. No problems at all.

Subject: 1970 Engine Question


&gt; Hello All,
&gt; I've got a question regarding placing an 1835cc engine in a 70 westy. 
&gt; Pat Flynn (fellow listee) posted a 70 with no engine.  I have a friend
&gt; who currently has an 1835cc engine available.  I am interested in
&gt; Patricks bus, however, I was wondering if the 1835cc engine would cause
&gt; a problem.  I know that the vents in the rear were made larger in later
&gt; models to accomodate for the 1700 and 1800cc engines.  Would engine
&gt; cooling be a problem with a 70 body style?  I'am assuming that the
&gt; engine would even work in a 70.  Am I wrong about that?
&gt; 
&gt; Its good to be back.  I've been away for about a month.  Thanks again!
&gt; 
&gt; Jason
