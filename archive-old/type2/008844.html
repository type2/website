I've got a '76 Bus and have been gradually repairing and replacing items to
improve the handling in cross winds.  I've replaced the tires with new
Yokohamas and installed new ball joints, tie rods, and a few other
suspension bits.  This has improved the handling quite a bit.

However, on really windy days with gusts over 30 mph, the bus is still a
handful at highway speeds.  I was contemplating adding sway bars and
aftermarket shocks.  Has anyone else found this to be helpful with cross
wind handling?  How difficult is the installation of each?
