Subject: Splitting cases; WHY didn't someone mention this??? :-(

Well, I found the bolt that was keeping the cases from splitting. They came 
apart very easy. Thanks all for the kind and good help.

Now, what I'm saying is for the benefit of future newbises who are splitting 
their first set of cases. I am not complaining for myself, as I figure that I 
caused this problem myself. PULEEEEEZE tell them that the pistons *have* to 
come off *before* the cases are split. PULEEEEEZE!!!

This will be obvious to those who have split even one VW air-cooled case set. 
However, for folks who have worked only on V and L types, it isn't at all 
obvious, and unless they are doing a tear-down-and-rebuild, that is to say, 
if they are just tearing down to slavage the cases, it is most likely that 
they will not remove the pistons unless they happen to notice those ridges 
inside the cases (not very obvious from the outside of a joined case)

Now for my dilemma. The cases are apart about 2.5&quot; and will not go back 
together because one has &quot;fallen&quot; a few degrees out of rotation. Nor can I 
find what is causing it to stay that way. I was able to twist the camshaft 
out and drop the crankshaft *nearly* into its position in one case half. 
However, the other case half will not rotate so that I can rejoin the cases 
to get to the piston circlips. Note, the pistons are up inside the bores, so 
the circlips are not reachable. Since I can't get the case back into 
alignment, I can't withdraw the pistons... the whole rotating assembly is 
locked except for maybe 5 degrees of rotation. Further, I can get only 3 of 
the rod nuts off, so I can't remove the rods.

Can anyone tell me what I can do short of hacksawing through the rods? I've 
been wrestling this thing alone (no help available) for over one hour and I 
am just knackered. 

Your assistance is graciously sought/Carron
