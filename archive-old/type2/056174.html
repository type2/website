Subject: It Runs!!!

In the continuing adventures of my first tune up on my bus, I am proud to
report that I am the owner of a RUNNING '77 bus.  Seems that I didn't have 1
&amp; 3's exhaust valves tight... that's what all the clatter was!  As soon as I
got them right, BINGO! 

Thanks to EVERYONE who helped me with good ideas!  What a great group!  I
hope that I can help someone too!

I do have one last question:  It seems to be missing now... it's mostly
noticeable at low idle.  Would a tight valve cause this? 

Thanks again!

On the road with my lady,
Marcus
