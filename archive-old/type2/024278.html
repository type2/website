&gt;  the &quot;valve seats&quot; have fallen through on my 72. 

This has happened to me two times in the last two years on my 72.  Why? Probably because I had some old, high mileage heads rebuilt, all in the name of saving a few bucks.  This time (I am currently in the process of putting my engine back together) I bought a set of brand new heads.  I hope this solves the problem because now I can't afford to pay rent, and I may end up living in the Gray Beast.
