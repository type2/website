Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection Woes.....

*IF* you're convinced that it's a FI problem and nothing else, then I'd
guess you're probably running too rich.  You don't really give us enough to
go on, but if the engine generally starts OK when cold (you don't say) but
will die easily when trying to idle warm and has poor power and poor top end
speed, then a very rich situation will fill the bill.  You might look at the
tail pipe to see if it's black with soot.

What causes a &quot;too rich&quot; condition?  All sorts of things... bad temp
sensors, improper adjustment of the AFM, too high fuel pressure, leaking
injectors, etc., etc.

There's just no substitute for a *very methodical* approach to these
problems: verifying good mechanical condition of the engine, seeing that the
ignition system is working properly and is &quot;spot on&quot;, then working through
the FI elements one at a time.  Having the father-in-law fiddle with the AFM
adjustment while you're driving the van just doesn't fill the bill, though
I'd agree with you that he's a hell of a guy.

Do you have a VOM?  Do you have a fuel pressure gauge?  Do you have a test
light?  Do you have a friend (or a father-in-law) that's willing to help?
If so, then you have all the tools you need to test the FI system.

After I'd determined that the mechanicals and ignition system were OK, I'd
first check the FI system for vacuum leaks.  Next the fuel pressure, noting
how long the pressure held after the fuel pump shut off; a rapid reduction
in pressure *could* be caused by a leaking injector, though there's other
things I'd check first.  I'd then check the TempII sensor, and if that was
OK (I'd guess your TempI sensor should be OK) I'd check for leaking
injectors, including the cold start valve.  Only after these things were
done would I move on to the AFM itself.  If your system doesn't have an O2
sensor (it shouldn't) then it's time to take it into a shop with an exhaust
gas analyzer.

&gt; 1978 2L FI Automatic Stock (this bus was bought in CA when new.)
&gt;
&gt; I recently replaced my AFM due to bad testing specs per the Bentely manual
after ruling out the fuel pump as a problem, checking all the vacuum lines,
adjusting the mixture,timing is correct, plugs are new.
&gt;
&gt; After I installed the AFM and set the mixture again, I'm having the same
exact problem.
&gt;
&gt; When I take my foot off of the gas pedal, or even just let up a little,
the engine just shuts off. Stop and go has just become stop and get
frustrated, then restart. It doesn't always start right away after dying
either. I only have start problems immediately after it dies on the road,
never any other time. Sometimes I can keep it alive by throwing it in
neutral and giving it gas throughout the stop, then throw it back in first
when its time to go, but this is no way to drive and it only works half of
the time anyways. This was the same thing that the bus was doing before I
replaced the AFM. There is also resistance/hesitation at around 40mph and it
won't go over 60.
&gt;
&gt; My stepfather, a 25 year mechanic with previous experience with this bus,
could not figure it out either. He was actually in the cargo area while I
was driving adjusting the mixture as I drove, to no avail.
