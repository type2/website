Subject: rocker arm stud stripped...new problem

hey volks,
 i just called the mechanic who is working on my
stripped out rocker arm bolt for an update.   seems
they have run into a little snag.   both heli coil and
time sert dont seem to make a repair kit for the
rocker arm bolt size on my 1800 head.   i beleive the
size is a 9.5?   they make a size up and a size down. 
 my mechanic is still working on a couple ideas and
double checking stuff, but any ideas guys and gals?  
i leave in 3 days for our trip and desparately need to
get this fixed.
help
