We installed a dealer DPD unit in our 71 clipper back in about 1976.
Dealership owner was a friend of my father's, and he came over and helped
my dad, a mechanically-inclined friend, and clueless me put the unit in.
This was the t-shaped overhead unit.  Installation took a couple of
evenings and plentiful cursing, but it worked fine for 4-5 years. By then
I had inherited the car and was a broke grad student; when the compressor
went out, we never tried to get it working again.

I still have about a dozen xeroxed pages that are all I ever remember
seeing in terms of a manual.  The pages have templates and hose diagrams,
etc.  I don't know why we never had more of a manual.

My current 71 westy came with a &quot;VW of America&quot; AC unit with the interior
portion fitting under the jumpseat, with the vents sticking out above
that.  Compressor and bracket were missing, but I found one in a junkyard.
I've toyed with the idea of putting a newer style compressor unit on it
and refitting it using as much of the old parts as possible.
