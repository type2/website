Subject: Rebuilt 2.0 L backfires, stops

This newly rebuilt 1976 2.0 liter fuel injected engine is back in the bus
and will start and run for 5-10 seconds before it backfires and stops.

Sometimes the backfire pops the rubber boot off the air intake.

We can do this over and over, and nothing seems to change the pattern. Runs
5-10 seconds, backfires, stops.

My mechanic and I are at wits end, having tried changing the timing in both
directions and shifting the ignition wires around. We have spark and fuel,
and the fuel pressure is normal. Our grounds are good. We think of
backfiring generally as being related to an overly rich mixture.

The other though we had was that one of the new intake valves was not
closing completely and the backfire was the result. So we are going to
re-check the compression of each cylinder, and look again at the intake
valve clearances. We will do this over the next week.

This rebuild included a new cam, new valves and valve springs, new pistons,
rings and cylinders. 

If anyone else has been in this situation, or has some suggestions, we
would be very happy to hear from you. I am subscribed to the digest, and
have been out of town for about a week, so I am very behind with the
reading. If I have overlooked similar posts, I analogize. Please post
directly to my home email address if you have anything to contribute. When
we find a solution, I will post it to the list.
