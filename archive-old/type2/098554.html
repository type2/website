Subject: Re: [T2] Ebay: the polls are in!

If we do in fact have a &quot;no advertising&quot; policy, including eBay, then we should enforce it across the board. I have seen days where half the posts were dedicated to the Bus Depot. I like the Bus Depot. I have always had good experiences with Bus Depot.
However, if we have a policy, it should be enforced across for all. If I can't let the list know about the taillights I am putting up on eBay, then Bus Depot shouldn't be able to tell me about the new taillights they just got in.
Or change the policy.
Peace,
