Subject: 77 FI bus - hesitation/stuttering problem FOUND (but not yet
  fixed)

I'll try not to make this too long, but there's a good lesson in here for
everyone with a fuel-injected bus.  I have a 1977 non-California manual
transmission bus (I'm the original owner).  I had an intermittent problem with
it hesitating, stuttering, or missing at about 3000 rpm, but sometimes at
other speeds.  I kept assuming it was the fuel injection (I've replaced the
air flow meter before), and was ready to have the engine (which was rebuilt
not too long ago) converted to carburetion, and posted a message here asking
for help.
    FIRST - a great big THANK YOU to those of you who urged me to stick with
the FI and find the problem.  The first suggestion most of you made was &quot;check
the points, plugs and timing.&quot;   Well, my mechanic had done that and so I
assumed that was not the problem.  I replaced a lot of FI parts, and nothing
fixed the problem.  And sometimes it didn't run very well either, particularly
on initial startup, requiring lots of gas to start up from a stop, dying when
I stepped on the gas, etc.
    FIRST LESSON:  Everyone should get a timing light and learn how to set
your own timing!!  My mechanic suggested that I might switch from regular
points to electronic &quot;points&quot;, and since that was something I could do myself,
I bought the kit, and set about installing it.  But first, I got out my timing
light (which I'd bought years ago but never got out of the box) and checked
the timing.  I found it was 12 degrees AFTER top dead center (and it's
supposed to be 7.5 degrees BEFORE)!  Well, I called my mechanic and he said
he'd checked the timing not too long ago, and couldn't understand why it was
so far off.  So, I put in the new electronic points, regapped the plugs, and
reset the timing, and it ran GREAT!!
    Now, I realize that I changed more than one thing at a time, so I may not
be completely sure of where all the hesitation/stuttering came from.  It may
have been a bad condensor (it had been literally years since it was changed,
not having been changed the last few times the points were changed).  That is
probably due to the fact that to replace the condensor, you have to take the
distributor out of the engine -- which isn't hard, but it's an extra step a
mechanic might not want to fool with.  Change to electronic points and you'll
never have to replace another condensor (the electronic system replaces the
condensor).
    I also discovered that I had colder plugs than stock in it, W7CC instead
of W8CC, and the gap was off due to wear, and so I regapped those, and later
changed to the hotter plug.  (But with the timing correct, even with the
colder plugs the bus ran great).
    HERE'S THE PAYOFF: After a couple of weeks, it wasn't running as well any
more, and so I checked the timing again, and it was at 0 degrees -- i.e., top
dead center.  I changed it back to the proper setting, and it ran great again.
Then a couple of weeks later, it was running crappy again, and I checked it
and it was 12 degrees BTDC.  Reset, and again it ran fine.  I replaced the
distributor clamp, but the problem persists.  The last time it got off, it was
30 degrees BTDC -- it was amazing the bus ran at all (but it did, just not
well).
    The bottom line is that the clamp is not holding the distributor firmly
enough, and the engine vibration over time causes the timing to change,
sometimes to the advanced side, sometimes to the retarded side!!  This is
happening despite the fact that it is being tightened down very tight, and it
is impossible to move the distributor by hand, either after I reset it, or
when I find the timing is off.  Also, when the timing is set properly, the
vacuum advance is pressing right up against the rubber boot on the cold start
valve (a design defect, in my opinion), and so there is some pressure on the
distributor, which may &quot;help&quot; the distributor move under the ineffective clamp
and engine vibration.
    I pulled the distributor today, and wiped the film of oil off the shaft,
and where the clamp sits on the shaft, the metal is all worn very shiny and
smooth!   I can only assume that this is why the clamp is not holding the
distributor the way it should.
    QUESTION:  is this something I can have a machinist &quot;roughen&quot; up so that
the clamp will work, or do I need a new distributor (if I can even find a
&quot;new&quot; one)?  Anyone with any ideas??
    In conclusion, I echo the advice found elsewhere on www.type2_dot_com:  get a
timing light and learn how to set your own timing.  Even if your mechanic sets
it, it can obviously change over time as it has in my bus, and setting the
timing is really easy to do, particularly if you replace the mechanical points
with the electronic ones.  BTW, since I replaced the points, and have kept the
timing set properly I have not had the hesitation/stuttering problem reappear,
and when the timing is properly set, the bus runs great!
    Here's a tool tip: it's not easy to get a wrench in to loosen and tighten
the distributor clamp, and using an open end wrench, you have to take it off
and put it back on several times to do the job.  Crescent Tools markets a
&quot;Ratcheting Combination Wrench Set&quot; which is a ratcheting box end wrench, and
they make the set in metric.  (Looks like the part number is FRM4.)  The
ratchet turns with just a 5 degree swing, whereas most standard wrenches
require 30 degrees.  It just slips over the clamp nut, and makes the job much
easier.  To tighten, just turn the wrench around.
    So the moral is to not give up on fuel injection too soon!   Hope this
helps somebody, and I'd be grateful for any suggestions for a fix for my
distributor.  Thanks!!
    Clay
