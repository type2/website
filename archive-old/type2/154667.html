Subject: UPDATE - Buses By The Depot (this Saturday)

I have updated the web page for the gathering -
http://home_dot_comcast_dot_net/~type2/BBD.htm - to indicate exactly where in the
campground we will be meeting (whether you are coming for the day or
spending the night). 

If you reserved a site, your site number is also on that page. 

Hope to see you there!
