Joe, since you never bothered to reply to this from Sunday, I can assume one of
three things:

&gt; What E switch are you looking at????   I have 6 of them in front of me right
&gt; now. ALL have 8 terminals = 2 30's, a 56, 58, 58b, 58L, 58R, and X.
&gt; NO 57.

&gt; &gt; Karl,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The Bentley shows only the wiring diagram it does not show the physical
&gt; &gt; switch. Only those that have wires attached to them. You are correct that
&gt; &gt; the diagram does not show the 57 attachment as I stated below 57 not used in
&gt; &gt; 73 and later. Yes all 211 941 531 E switches have a terminal 57 this is used
&gt; &gt; in 71 and 72 but not later. As you stated this is for the dash indicator
&gt; &gt; light.
&gt; &gt;

1) you don't want to admit I am right

2) you never even bothered to look at any of your E switches or the picture of
the PLAIN switch I sent you

3) you make your own E switches with terminal 57 on them [yeah, right!]

I want to believe it is #1 and you don't want to eat crow. But more than likely
it is #2 and you can't believe your precious parts book is wrong.

Since you didn't reply to sunbus's post yesterday [I will paste it here in case
you missed it]:

''My '73 Westfalia campmobile was manufactured in the first
week of May, 1973.   The original headlamp switch failed back
in the early '90s.  The dimmer for the instrument lighting
came unwound and shorted out.  I am certain that the switch
was the one installed at the factory in Hannover, Germany.
My father bought the car new and I bought it in '80. I have
all the car's service records from day one.

The only replacement switch I could find at the time was
lacking one of the terminals (#57?) found on the original
switch.  This terminal's function was to illuminate a green
lamp in the dummy light cluster when the parking lights were
left burning.  I wrapped the spade connector, which had no
corresponding terminal on the new switch, in black electrical
tape.

I figured I could use that green dummy light in a future use
such as fog or driving lamps.  I think the proper way is to
find a replacement switch that will restore the green dummy
light function, the way the VW factory designed the system.
Sounds like I should look for a '71-'72 switch.''

I can assume #3 is false also, otherwise you would have jumped right on it
offering him a brand new $35 guaranteed-to-work E switch with terminal 57.

Funny how you didn't reply and tell him he really has a terminal 57 and to take
better look at it......

If you had done a quick search in the type2 archives under dash lights, one of
the 1st ones mentioning this problem shows up about the fourth one down:

Great work Craig!

Here are some thought about dealing with replacement switch problems.

58 is juice to the fuse box for the parking lights.
57 is juice to the parking light indicator on the instrument pod.
58b is juice for all three dash pods (speedo, clock, guage cluster)

When you pull the knob out one click all three of the above get juice so you get
dash lights, indicator, and outside parking lights. Pull it out again and you
get headlights too but 57 looses juice. 58b has the rheostat control.

Replacement switchs do not have 57 for the indicator lamp. You simpley put a Y
on spade 58 and the indicator will be on when the headlamps are on too but this
may not be a bad thing when driving in the rain during the day because you might
not forget the lights are on when stopping the vehicle.

If you rheostat on your original switch goes bad you can reroute 58b to 58 and
will have power to the dash pod lights and bypass the scratchy rheostat (fire
hazard)

Good luck
Chris''

Did Chris miss that terminal 57 on the E switch also??

Why am I harping on this?        FALSE/BAD/WRONG INFO   I have been repairing
cars for over 35 years....that is what I do for a living. For the past 22 years
I have worked at the same Mercedes dealership. I repair a lot of cars that have
been butchered by shade tree mechanics and independant repair shops. The biggest
problem is WRONG information which causes wrong repairs, parts replaced for no
reason but 'they' were told they were bad, lots of lost time spent going over
'repairs'. Time and money wasted for nothing.

Your attitude is like a pimply faced kid that just got his first job at Pep Boys
and says 'that has to be the part, that is what the BOOK says'.
