ola,

	i started up my 71 westy tonight for my weekly start up until i can get it
inspected and roadworthy and encountered a hopefully minor problem.  it had
been running for a few minutes and i stepped on the gas a little to get the
revs up and all of a sudden, it started making a clanging type of sound.  i
shut it off, waited a couple of minutes and started it up again and it made
the same noise.  i looked at the engine and everything seems to be in
order.  i start it every week and normally let it run for about 10 minutes
and then shut it off.  there is plenty of oil in the engine and i'm not too
sure what the problem could be.  i really hope i didn't break a rod here.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
