Subject: [T2] VW Trend December 2000

Hello Everyone....I'm not sure if everyone has seen the new VW Trend yet..but 
for those who have...I have a question. It is about the beautiful blue 66 
Splitty...anyone have any idea what type of tires the guy is running on that 
bus. I am looking to get four new tires...probably 6 or 8 ply C or D rated 
tires...but I want the white wall look...If anyone can help that would be 
great..Thanks..Adam
