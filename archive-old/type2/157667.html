&gt; OK, all you Megasquirt gurus.   I'm in the bus for the long haul.  I
have a 2.0 engine to rebuild and install in either my bus or another
rust-free bus that I purchase down the road.  When I do, I'd like to
install a Megasquirt setup.  For now, I'm sticking with the single Weber
because it is so simple and it is performing so well for me.
&gt;
&gt; Just curious:  on all of the newer cars I've owned with computers and
FI, you don't really have to warm the engine.  You really can't tell any
difference running it cold than running it hot because the computer
adjusts for everything. So you guys with the Megasquirt, is that true for
your busses? Now, I've never believed that it is good to run even a newer
vehicle stone cold.  But some say that it is actually better to drive it
and let it warm up under load.  I'm not qualified technically to get in
that debate.  Now I HAVE to warm the bus up before it will run well.
&gt;
&gt; I eventually plan on having a permanently installed laptop in my bus
among multiple other electronic devices including a ham radio station.
I'd like to have it hooked up so I can constantly monitor all aspects of
the engine.  From what I've read, I believe that is possible.  Installing
it and getting it to work is going to be the hard part as I'm not a
mechanic or an electronics expert.

There's no trick to making a vehicle run well during warmup.  All you have
to do is tailor the mixture to the engine temperature.

Conventional carburators do a poor job of this, as there is no direct
feedback of engine temperatures to the enrichment mechanism.  The choke is
closed to the point where the mixture is rich enough to fire when cold,
then opened via an electrically heated bimetallic strip.  The strip acts
as a crude timer that takes longer to open the choke if its initial
temperature is low.

Now, if you are lucky, you can get the choke and the engine's needs in
synch and get great drivability during warmup.  My bus with a 30/31PICT is
great this way and I'm loathe to touch anything for fear of screwing it
up!

With most EFI systems you set up a fuel map of fuel input versus engine
RPM.  You then set up another map of manifold pressure that is used to
modify the RPM input according to the power demands of the engine.  A
third map of engine temperature also modifies the RPM input.

So, the way it works is, the engine measures its own RPM.  It looks up the
fuel value on the fuel map, multiplies this by the value on the manifold
pressure map and multiplys that by the value on the engine temperature
map.  The result is used to open the injector for a period of time
sufficent to meter the proper quantity of fuel.

This sounds complex, but it is a lot simpler than the combination of high
speed, low speed, and enrichment mechanisms all working together in a
carburator.  You can alter one of the fuel injection parameters without
affecting the others.

With EFI, all the parameters needed to determine the proper mixture are
fed back from the engine itself.  There's no guesswork about what mixture
the engine needs, the engine just does the math and squirts the gas.

There are some pretty good tuning instructions available on this site:

They are specific to the SDS system, but the idea is the same as the MS
system.
