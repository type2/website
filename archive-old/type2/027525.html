Volks,
In the spirit of the day, I invite you to check out a collection of interior 
hardware parts taken from a '78 Van that I recently acquired via eBay. Go 
to:

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=470354609

to view the choices. Email me off list to indicate your preference, and I'll 
send it to you for merely the cost of postage.
Happy Halloween!
Roland - 75 Westy (dressed in Orange)
