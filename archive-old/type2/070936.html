Hi 
Don, Maybe worth checking your output to the battery from alternator. I lost
one cell of a battery without notice on a trip. I had previously- a few weeks
before, had problems with the output from the regulator switching from normal
to about 16 V (noticed cos the lights suddenly got brighter and then dimmed
when they felt like it etc... frickering lights......and had not used the
lights for a while, so could have been going on for some time) I replaced the
regulator and that solved that particular problem. However, I suspect the high
voltage damaged the battery and led to the subsequent failure. The battery
with 1 cell down was about 10.5 V and was enough to keep going once started
but as soon as I stopped, needed to push, or in my case, get a pull-start from
a passing tractor.
If you do have a intermittent high output, I guess it could damage your new
battery... hopefully you're are OK though ?!!

&gt;It turns out that I had something go wrong INTERNALLY in my battery that
caused &gt;it to
&gt;break the circuit.  My VW guy replaced the pos and neg cables and the
battery, &gt;and it
&gt;fired right up.  It was strange
