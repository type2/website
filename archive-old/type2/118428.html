Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild vs. LongBlock

I think the general rule here is that you can rebuild an engine better than
a volume rebuilder, but you can't rebuild it cheaper.  If you're unsure of
yourself, if you don't have the tools and the time and the patience to do an
excellent job nor the willingness to educate yourself about all the bits and
pieces, then buy a longblock.  If you're very confident in the skill and
integrity of the rebuilder, so much the better.  There's a lot of
satisfaction in doing the job itself and no small amount of learning that
goes along with it, but those things don't really translate into dollars.

Subject: [T2] Rebuild vs. LongBlock


&gt;   This is a Friday question.  I am looking for opinions of rebuilding vs.
&gt; purchasing a long block.  Rebuild costs seems to be within $100 or $200 of
the
&gt; cost of a rebuilt longblock, so, is it worth it to do the rebuild.  There
is a
&gt; VW shop near me that has specialized in VW's since the 1960's.  I was told
&gt; that machine shop work would average about $500 to $600 for the average
&gt; engine.  Then I would have to purchase the necessary bearings, pistons,
&gt; cylinders, gaskets, etc etc to complete the rebuild.  This same shop has
&gt; rebuilt engines (each one is rebuilt by the owner of the shop) for $850.
So,
&gt; other than gaining experience, what am I saving by doing the rebuild
myself?
&gt; I am a novice, the owner of the shop should be an expert by now.  Opinions
&gt; please, either p-mail or on the list.  This might be of interest to others
&gt; besides myself.
