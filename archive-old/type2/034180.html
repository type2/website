&gt; Well, I looked around the Library and the write-up on the various

&gt; &gt; It would be better to make the test as simple as you can.
&gt; &gt; What I would do is to use a few soda cans.
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; if radiation accounts for 10%, then it becomes significant.
&gt; 
&gt; I have just ONE little question though: How do you then attach the
&gt; soda can
&gt; to the engine?

I'm not recommending attaching the can to the engine!  The point is
that using the soda can as a test object minimizes the number of
variables that can muddle the test data.  You have a controlled heat
source (current through a resistor), a consistant size, shape, and
mass, and only one variable to change.  You could do this with an
engine, but it would be a lot harder to get the test conditions all the
same.
