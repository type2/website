Subject: Re: Cloaking Device Shot (Dual Brake Circuit Warning Light)
In-Reply-To: &lt;4.1.19990317132418.00943820_at_texas_dot_net&gt;
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.9903171101440.25620-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

The button on the dash with the &quot;B&quot; on its face is the dual brake circuit
warning light.  It is, in terms of computer logic an XOR test.  If only
one side of it is getting current and the other side is not, then it comes
on. The way it gets current is from the brake pressure switches on your
master cylinder.  There are two switches (and two pistons inside the MC),
one for the front wheels and one for the back.  If both are off, the light
is off (not A and not B)  if both are activated (A and B) the light is
off, but if one is activated and the other is not (A and not B or not A
and B) then the light comes on.  The reason this might happen is that one
of the circuits is not developing pressure.

Because brake failure is a relatively rare event, VW installed a test
circuit in the module as well. Depending on year, this can be (a) the
pushbutton &quot;cloaking device&quot;.  I didn't think this was ever installed on
buses, tho it was this way on my '71 stupid beetle (tm), or (b) a circuit
that lit the lamp while the car was starting (in early bay windows (per
bentley, I ain't owned one)), or (c)(in later buses [I've no idea when the
switch occured]) by using it as a parking brake indicator.

If the light flickers or blinks when you depress the brakes, then you have
a serious problem!!!  Once complete failure of a circuit occurs, you will
not need the warning light to let you know that you have a problem, but a
quick blink as you put the brakes on can let you know that something is
amiss in the brakes before it kills you.  

If you wish to conduct a test of the logic, not just the bulb, then get
under their and remove one set of wires from your master cylinder and put
on the brakes.  The light should come on and stay on as long as the brakes
are depressed.  Then switch plugs and make sure it is working the other
way too.
