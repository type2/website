Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Lifters / Rocker Arms - Adjusting?

Thanks Don, I really appreciate the advice. I do in fact have hydraulic lifters. I'm very frustrated with this. It appears as though maybe some of the lifters aren't properly pumping up. I'm wondering if I shouldn't just switch to solid lifters at this point.


I'll read the article when I get home. It's a GEX rebuild. It has less than 2,000 miles on it since the rebuild. It was installed by the previous owner. It's never overheated either...


Thanks Don.

Todd

&gt; 
&gt; What engine did you get? Does it have hydraulic lifters? If you aren't
&gt; sure, ask your builder. Because if you adjust solids like hydraulics
&gt; you get burnt valves and zero compression.
