Hi Volks,
    I'm having a little problem with the turn signals on our 71 Westy.  They 
work fine as long as the head lights are not on.  If the head lights are on, 
the right side blinks fast, as if a bulb were burnt out.  Also with the head 
lights on the R/H front and rear turn signals blink alternately.  I'm 
thinking it's grounding problem, probably in the right rear light housing.
    What do you think it might be ?
