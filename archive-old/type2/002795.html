To the list,

I feel very honored and privileged to be a part of all of you with all of
these professions. I statue each and every one of you. This may sound like a
resume but it isn't. I know of other way of telling about myself, much like
you have done.

I am a retired (1994) E-8, Air Reserve Technician (ART).  My profession
covered flying 5 different Rescue aircraft spanning over 28 years. I held
two positions. My first and primarily job was an Airborne Communications
Superintendent.  In my non-flying position, I was the Wing Headquarters
Communications Management Specialist. I have credit with the assistance of
saving of 274 lives in such activities as the Mount St Helens Volcanic
Eruption, San Francisco Earthquake and Hurricane Andrew to mention just a
few.  I provided critical mobile &amp; fixed satellite and other communication
systems. 1996 I went to work for a company to develop a military landing
system utilizing the transponder on aircraft. Because of mis-management of
funds, twenty-five of us, including yours truly was let.  This may be my
second retirement (g)(g).  I have a BA degree in Communications Technology.
I really enjoy my 79 bus.  I just wish I had stock I had stock in the Bank
Of America, so I could really make this Loaf really neat!!!
