X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Volks,

A second notice, since a number of people missed this the first time.  I
will be there and I am going to make chili again.  One difference, I may
add meat this year. If anyone is counting on this being veggie, let me
know, as it is easier and cheaper to leave the meat out :-)  (and if it is
a concern for anyone else... yes, it will be kosher beef :-)

                           H Steven Dolan

Subject: Mid-Atlantic Holiday Bus Fest - Dec 16th!


Howdy List,

Ever wonder what face that goes with what e-mail address? Do you like
parties and free food? Want to see our list-server &quot;Gerry&quot; in person? 

In mid-December for the past 5 years, a group of us VW lovers have been
meeting at Tom Forhan's house in Takoma Park, MD for what we have called the
&quot;Mid-Atlantic Holiday Bus Fest&quot;. 

Well, Tom F. is a little too busy to open up his house to all VW crazies
this year...so we have decided that I would host the party at my house this
year. I live about 2 miles from Tom Forhan's place, so the travel time
should be no different than before. And Tom has assured me that he will
attend!

There are usually a slew of Vanagons, a few bay windows and the occasional
splittie that makes the day. VW lovers and their families are encouraged to
attend...our kids will be there (ages 7.5, 5.5 and 4)and would love some
playmates. 

For past parties, have a look at:

AND

AND some raw pictures at

The party will be Saturday, December 16th from 2:00PM until ??

We will provide drinks (soda, beer, whatever), sandwiches and some lite fare
for us to munch on. Feel free to bring anything additional that you would
like to share. I'm hoping that Steve Dolan will bring his chili again this
year.

I have a diveway almost as long (and flatter) as Tom Forhan's, so if anybody
needs to &quot;driveway camp&quot; the night before or after..welcome! Street parking
shold be no problem, either.

Address of the party:

Tom Carrington

About 2 miles after you cross the American Legion bridge into MD, the
Interstate will split. Take the right-hand side of the fork, which keeps you

We are at almost the very top of the hill, on the left at 10400 Eastwood

There is also parking behind our house on Woodridge Ave - look for the other
busses!
