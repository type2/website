Subject: [T2] self retracting belts that fit a 79 Westy???


&gt; I scrounged through the wrecking yard today and couldn't find a self
&gt; retracting seatbelt that would fit into my 79 Westy. The ones from later
&gt; bugs(which are too short anyway)  and vanagons all have the belt mechanism
&gt; pointing straight up like this.

I put the Vanagon belts in my daughters 77 Westy. On the drivers side all I
had to do was drill 2 holes in the partition near the top, one for the bolt
and one for the locating pin. Then I put a large washer behind the nut. Just
put the old bolt back in the bottom hole after removing the old belt. The
upper hole is still used. Make sure you get the matching Vanagon buckle!!!
The passenger side of a Westy leaves a lot to be desired for mounting a
retractable belt..... Because of the swiveling seat, there is no good place
to mount the reel. The only flat area is below the pedestal on the cargo
side but I never found any belts that were long enough. You would need one
at least 2' longer.......
