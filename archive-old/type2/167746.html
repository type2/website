John,

Sending good vibes your way.

I've been there, it sucks, take a deep breath and go grab a beer.

When you're finished with that beer (and maybe a couple of its friends),
come home and take a look at your engine.  Check the valve clearances,
then check the compression again.  Be sure to verify the other normal
stuff too - timing, point gap, oil level, etc. - and perhaps consider
draining that old oil and putting a couple of fresh quarts in it before
you test that compression.

Let us know what the compression looks like then, and perhaps try to start
her up again, just to see what's going on.  With any luck it's just a
burnt valve.

If, after all of this the compression still looks bad - and maybe you've
done a leak-down test too - consider pulling your engine and starting your
next journey: tear-down.  With any luck, all you need is a new head or
two.  You can probably pick up a good, used one somewhere if you're not
sure about the rest of the engine, but want to give it a try - should run
you about $50.

I know all of this sucks, and it is majorly frustrating, but ... well,
there is no &quot;but&quot;: it sucks.  But we're thinking of you and wishing you
the best.

Cheers,
     Tom
