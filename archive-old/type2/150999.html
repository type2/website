Subject: RE: [T2] Seeking replacement front signal lenses/rubber seal,
  71 T2?

Check theSamba_dot_com.  I see good used sets on there all the time.  The newer 
repros aren't anything to write home about, but they're decent.  You can 
find those anywhere.  CIP1.  BusDepot.  Wolsburg West.  The Samba.  CIP 
carried genuine Hella lenses for awhile.  I think I scored the last set they 
had.  Taillight and sidemarkers aren't made by SWF or Hella anymore either.  
I've got three NOS sets of those for when I get aound to restoring the body 
on mine.  Happy signalling!

The Wonderbus's front signal lenses are cracked, the rubber seals are
funky. I'd like to replace them with good condition used or new -- sources?
