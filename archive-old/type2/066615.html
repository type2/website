Subject: 65' bus door key question

I have a 65' bus as some of you  may know..

My question is as follows..

If you take the door handle apart (take the cargo door handle) you will
notice that there is a four digit number with a &quot;T&quot; preceeding it (i.e.
T1234) I know this number corresponds to the way to cut they key. M

My question is does VW still have those codes about i.e. can you give them
that number and they would know how to properly cut the key?

I ask because the key i have for my bus doors is pretty disfigurred and
would like to cut a &quot;correct&quot; one.

I am 99% sure that the key for the igntion and the key for the doors were
different on a 65' bus am I correct?
