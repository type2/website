   Well, in the first place I'm talking about &quot;in general&quot; --- *ALL* VW
engines have oil temps far too hot. Brand new, stone stock -- the oil
temp is going to be over 200 on long runs and that destroys the oil.
    And, secondly, other than that general problem with that *ALL* VW's
have, I don't have any overheating problem with my machine. 
    And thirdly, I'm running a '81 engine in a '73 bus -- and outside of
having some sheet metal artist totally create new custom tin, there just
ain't no way to seal that puppy up even if I thought it was needed. The
'81 compartment is much bigger and different shaped, so the '81 tin had
to (a) have the front piece &quot;custom&quot; bent to cram it in there, and the
rearmost piece totally removed. And the '73 case is too different from
the '81 case so the '73 fanhousing and tin won't fit -- I tried that a
couple of years ago, when I first did the conversion. 
    If you really think your oil temp doesn't go over 200, try putting a
temp gauge on it.
