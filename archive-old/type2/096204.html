Subject: Re: [T2] Will this work as fuel line shut-off valve

&gt; I'm thinking about putting a manual shut-off valve near the tank
&gt; outlet.  I called NAPA and they had nothing.  I went to the local marine
&gt; supply store and they had nothing that would work.  I then went to Home
&gt; Depot where they had a small shut-off valve that will work for water and
&gt; oil.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know if a valve is approved for oil whether it is suitable
&gt; for gasoline?

I use a &quot;gas&quot; not &quot;Gasoline&quot; all brass ball valve and have had no trouble
with it for about 5 years now.  have FI so I use two, got one of em at
Home Depot I know.
