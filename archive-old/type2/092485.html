Subject: Re: bus stopped in a bad place

&gt;my bus was running great. Then SUDDENLY started
&gt;missing badly and lost virtually all power.

[...]

&gt;it was like one cyl. was firing. had to
&gt;tickle the gas pedal and ride the clutch.

&gt;points and condenser are fairly old.

This sounds like the way my bus acted when the condenser died, FWIW.  Good luck!  I feel your pain. BTDT.

joe
