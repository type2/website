Subject: trans ratio's

Hey Y'all,
  I have a 70 Bus that the trans went bad in and I swapped the trans for 
an 091 from a later Bus. I don't know what year the trans came out of 
and I want to find out what the ratio is. Is there a way I can find out 
by the # on the side? Anyone know how to tell?
