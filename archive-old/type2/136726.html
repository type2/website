Subject: Re: [T2] Installing a BN2 heater in a Westy

Hi Chris,

The combustion chamber is inside the center of the heater. The outside 
of the heater doesn't get anywhere near the flashpoint of the wood from 
the back seat.

I put a BN-2 between the frame rails of my 72 westy back in 1986, and 
it worked great. The output went forward to the dash/knee vents and 
worked very well.


Happy trails,

&gt; Why not under the bus between the frame rails?
