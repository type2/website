Subject: RE: [T2] Weber tuning- low power uphill

Al,

Know what kind of rpm's you were turning at the time?
What was the weather like(cold?)...and what gear were you in?

Sounds like you were just too far down the power band to
make much power with a 110 cam and a heavy bus.

Dwell seems a little high, timing sounds correct.

Bet it runs ok when you get some RPM's up? right?

*Dual* 40 idf's???


Cheers, dave

&gt; HAD a 34 pict that was dying on it, but I had barely decent hill
