&gt;I've got a metal manifold arrangement for my

&gt;except I wonder if it wasn't a metric equivalent.

There is no metric equivalent to NPT that I know of.  NPT is pipe thread, 
which is tapered.  As you turn in the fittings, they gradually get tighter 
from thread interference.  The oil drain plug is also a (larger) NPT thread.

&gt;I'm not familiar with the type of fittings you
&gt;described, but I'm assuming you are using a flexible
&gt;teflon hose to connect to the block.  Does the teflon
&gt;resist pressure well?

It resists something like 2000 psi of pressure in hydraulic brakes, so I 
would have to say yes.  :)

&gt;Where do you get the parts you
&gt;described?

http://www.earlsindy_dot_com/products/ is where I got mine.  Lots of places 
stock Earls parts - they are very well known in the industry.
