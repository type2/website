Subject: VW Bullies

Volks,

I was just visiting Australian Vintage sites.  They get away with murder =
Down Under, still using the insignia and all the trademark names.  I know =
why.  VW Auistralia disbanded in 1968.  The jigs were shipped to Brazil.

Anyone ever heard of the Country Buggy?

Curt
