Subject: Re: [T2] Photos of my tach install

hello Roberto   I think that around 5500 rpms is what the high is recommended 
. the formula Vee guys will run at 6500-6800 rpms using stock push rods, and 
valve train.  I always find that amazing that they will stay together at the 
high rpms on a 40 hp motor. later and have fun  Mark Dearing
