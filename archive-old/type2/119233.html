Subject: Re: [T2] More tranny help , update still no 3rd

After speaking with a few people I think Greg Potts was right on originally.
When he said:

Just before EB2002 I had to rebuild the cage (universal joint) at the
nose-cone of the westfakia, every time I shifted into third I wondered
if the linkage was going to stay together or not. After a while I
realized it was going to be OK, and when I got home I replaced the
linkage with a new one for $10 from a local VWFLAPS.
What exactly is this part called, so I can see if the FLAPS carries it.
Part number would be even better  :))

Peace,

Snoopy
