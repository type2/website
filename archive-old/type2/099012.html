&gt;I used injector seals from Bus Boys for my injectors. I was disappointed with
the quality as one of the seals had a small tear in the rear. Does not effect
the seal but this should not happen. Used it as I had no other choice.

I ordered seals from Bus Boys (311-198-261A  1974-1979  $3.75 kit) and I
couldn't tell the difference from the ones that I removed except the new ones
looked, well new. They helped increase the vacuum because the old ones were
cracked.

Maybe Ron can explain where these affordable seals come from? At these prices
they don't seem like Bosch.

Anyway, at www_dot_carmadillo_dot_com, you can see pictures of the seals they sell.

They have a small and large seals for 57 cents and 66 cents each.  They also
have Bosch seals for 3.85 and 6.02 each!

From the pictures it looks like the expensive Bosch seals aren't that well
either.  I'm not knocking Bosch but it seems just looking at the seals doesn't
mean much.
