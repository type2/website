Subject: Re: [T2] Gauges A newbie Question


&gt; In the dash is a place to the right of the Speedometer that is a
&gt; blank round punch-out.   I *know* I've seen a triple gauge unit there
&gt; in someone's Bus.   It was Temp, Oil Pressure and one other just like
&gt; in my old Mercedes of the same era.

The only thing VW put there was a clock. There was a VERY rare optional tach
that went there also. But it is almost as rare as hens teeth.
In order to put gauges there, you would need to spend a few days walking
around wrecking yards and looking at other cars dashes. But then you might
have a compatibility problem with sending units.......
