Subject: VWoA, and Bow Wow Auto Parts

I thought I'd pass this on,, 
I remember the garage I apprenticed at about 1983 was given a cease and desist
[sp?] order because they had painted a few emblems on the wall facing the
passing traffic.  One was a Vw emblem , 

Bow Wow sent me a new Catalogue with an insert today... and it describes why the
name Bow-Wow

1972, Warren Buser of Seattle Wa. retired from the U.S. Coast guard and opened
an Auto Parts store for Volkswagens ONLY.  Various store names chosen were
challenged by VWoA as indicating a VW connection so he chose his childhood
nickname of &quot;Bow-Wow&quot; and defied an objection to that name.

So from that part of the short letter, it is apparent that VW has been chasing
the Trademark infringements for quite some time!

BTW they were nice enough to send a R &amp; L sticker of the Dog!
