Subject: Re: Re: Distributor score

It seems to get hung up on a lip to a passage that looks like it is connected 
to the fuel pump.

Upon further reading in the Bentley there is a note that says On some single 
carb rebuilt/exchange (AK) engines the distributor drive shaft bore in the case 
was machined out and the lower shim was replaced with a 3mm thick spacer. The 
shims were then placed between the spacer and the distributor drive shaft.
