Subject: Re: [T2] Westy pop-top color ?

Hi Kevin,

One quart/Liter was enough for two coats on the pop top, both  
sections. And there was **just** enough left over to coat both the  
bumpers once.

Didn't get that email somehow. Been absolutely slathered with spam  
lately for some reason.  Unfortunately I didn't have time to install  
the oil temp gauge before EB so I have no data for this trip.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
