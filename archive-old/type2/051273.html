Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling a trailer behind a bus

What should one look for in a trailer and hitch for a bus?

I am an avid overpacker, and a trailer is just what I need!  Not too
large and as light as possible.  I'm looking in my local paper's online
classifieds, and not seeing any trailers...  Their indexing system
sucks.
