&gt;From: &quot;Scott Walker&quot; &lt;swalker72_at_KNOLOGY.NET&gt;
&gt;
&gt;My friend (guy who owns the house where my van is parked) has
&gt;decided not to take his vans with him when he moves.  I know that
&gt;this is the Vanagon list, but I know that for many of us, our
&gt;interest in VW's crosses model and generation lines.
&gt;
&gt;The vans are:
&gt;
&gt;A '72 that runs but is incomplete and very rusty but would still
&gt;make an excellent parts vehicle.  1700 (I think) with single carb
&gt;and 4 spd.  Does run, but is not road worthy.
&gt;
&gt;A '78 that does not run but is complete.  Green with green plaid
&gt;interior.  Body is very good with some surface rust.  Windshield
&gt;is cracked and sliding door needs attention, but the parts are
&gt;there on the '72 to fix.  2 liter with automatic.  Engine and
&gt;tranny are outside of van, engine is locked up.  Was converted to
&gt;carb, but have FI parts on hand (may need fuel pump).
&gt;
&gt;He is looking for $1500 for the pair and they are located in
&gt;Augusta, GA.
