&gt; Folks,

&gt; I have two different kinds of chrome headlight rings on my 78 and need to
&gt; know which is the correct one.
&gt;
&gt; The passenger side is metal with a hella part number 11-941-175A
&gt; The drivers side is plastic with a KOA? part number of 211-941-177

For a '78 I'd suspect that the plastic one is stock, but if the metal ring
fits use it.

BTW, the only difference between the bug and bus metal rings is the
location of the drain hole.
