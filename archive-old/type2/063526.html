Jon:

I have a remarkably similar medical problem, but I got mine in a 
stationary '70 Ford PU.  After questioning the LIST, I discovered that 
although SOME mid '70s pancake-engined busses had headrest seats 
that would fit the tracks of my 1970 bus, ONLY THE DRIVER'S 
SEAT would fit.  The passenger seats mounted in a totally different 
way. :(  I did, however, get some nice offers of seats for sale.

After checking the availability in local wrecking yards, I discovered that 
they were generally hard to find, pretty worn, and not cheap--in the 
neighborhood of two-hundred bucks for a set of pretty rough ones.

I finally got disgusted and went in search of VOLVO SEATS.  These 
are without a doubt THE BEST seat available.  Period.  I went out to 
the Volvo wreckers and bought a pair of seats identical to the seats I 
put in my '74 Bug &quot;daily&quot; driver.

The best Volvo seats come out of the 740's--black leather, nice head 
rest, padded leather head rest insert, adjustable lumbar support!!, 
HEATING COILS INSIDE SEAT, etc.  Totally luxurious seating 
accommodation.  The first set I bought was $175--slightly worn, but a 
good price.  The passenger seat was actually worn more, at the front, 
like where a rug rat would be kicking its feet, but the driver's was a lot 
better.  The set I bought for the bus was $325, but they look absolutely 
new, the yuppie must have totaled the car driving off the dealer's lot! 

I am 6' tall, and long in the body, so in the bus the seats put my head 
against the Westfalia ceiling (which I believe is lower than the normal 
one).  I removed the adjustment mechanism, which necessitated 
welding (yah, I know) a piece of angle iron to the remaining metal 
support, to bolt it to the wheel well.  It doesn't adjust front to back--I 
just put it where I wanted it (fits the wife too, although she is much 
shorter).

In my searches, I discovered that most seat are nowhere near low 
profile enough for a bus, with the sole exception of a few Japanese 
ones.  They could probably just be bolted in--adjusting mechanism and 
all, and still fit you.  I didn't get them because they were nearly as 
expensive as the Volvo's, but without the lumbar support (although 
they did have headrests), leather, or fine appearance. (too bad they put 
RADIATORS on those things!)

I hope this gives you something to keep you up at night pondering.  :)
