Subject: Transmission cooler for air cooled van

Hello All,

I have a question for the automatic experts out there concerning the
automatic transmission fluid cooler used on air cooled engines.  I realize
the wasserboxers had a tranny cooler which used the coolant for cooling.  I
do not see any cooler lines on the tranny in my friends Westy, which
concerns me.  Can anyone tell me which ports/connectors are for tranny
cooler lines, and if adding a tranny cooler is a good idea?
