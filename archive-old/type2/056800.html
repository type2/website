Subject: RE: Unknown knob on '69 westy dash

[...]

&gt;&gt; I have a control of some sort on the dash of my '69 campmobile
that I was wondering about.  It is left of the ignition switch and it's
the first control closest to the driver's door. &lt;&lt;

This is the switch that controls power to the Westy's interior light above the 
table on the left side.  The light fixture has 2 switches to control 3 bulbs.  
One switch turns on a single bulb, the other switch turns on a pair of bulbs, 
and for maximum illumination turn on both switches and light all 3 bulbs.

HOWEVER, the dash switch must be pulled out or no power gets to the switches 
on the fixture.

I usually leave both fixture switches on and control that light from the dash 
switch when we aren't camping.  That way I can turn the light on and off from 
the driver's seat to check on passengers, cargo, etc....
