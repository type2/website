Subject: Re:would you drive this?

Anthony,
   It doesn't sound like a 300 mile drive I'd want to make.  With oil 
streaming out of the engine you'd be lucky to make it from one mile marker 
to the next.  And if you could add oil often enough to keep going, how long 
will it be until the clutch becomes oil soaked and starts to slip?  Then 
again, are you sure it's engine oil that's leaking and not oil from the 
transaxle?  Because if it is, it won't be easy to keep checking and adding 
as you go.  My vote is for towing or trucking it home and then doing a 
proper job of the repairs.
