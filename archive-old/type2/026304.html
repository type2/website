Subject: Lack of cooling flaps
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD11011F4CC0_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

Regarding the lack of cooling flaps on a Type IV:
Lets not panic here.
Although the flaps should be there, and whenever you get the chance you
should install them,
MY OPINION is that this is not an &quot;Oh God I cna't drive my bus until I fix&quot;
it situation.
The removal of these flaps, although wrong, seems to be a very common
situation, and there are
thousands of busses out there driving around without them, many of them have
gone a long ways, 
although probably not as far as they might have with them installed.
Let me re-iterate before a big flame war starts here: THE FLAPS SHOULD BE
THERE, AND
YOU SHOULD INSTALL THEM THE NEXT CHANCE YOU GET. But it is not as serious a
something like having no oil in your engine, or some other situation that
absolutley has to be fixed
RIGHT NOW! 

IMHO of course

PS: Should all of the holes between the halves of the case have bolts in
them? Do they all need to be tight?
How tight?
