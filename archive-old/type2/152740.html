Subject: Re: [T2] bending brake lines

Being in the biz for a long time, I'm pretty sure from what I've seen of
these particular kits (based on the on-line photos) Ron/BD offers is
German-made (most likely Cohline) with the proper metric ends.  While I am
sure that Taiwan/Chinese made brake lines are out there (I've seen an IRS
Beetle line kit made in Taiwan recently), what I've seen are for the
American/Domestic vehicle market (ie: Everco/Bundyflex) usually made in USA,
Mexico or Brazil.  Before the advent of these kits (and individual CORRECT
length lines), the only option was making due with the generic length metric
Bundyflex lines, having to make-do with what was available.  My Ex-64
Notchback in the 80s was a PITA to do when I had to replace most of the
lines back then.

And while I would agree that metric-end lines can be locally obtained, I've
yet to find any Carquest/Kragen/Checker/Shucks/PepBoys/Autozone/Advanced
Auto/Parts Plus, etc., offers anything except generic length lines, ie: 8&quot;
10&quot;, 20&quot; and so on.  I defy anyone to find a proper Front-to-Rear 110&quot;
(2760mm) (50-79 Bus) sitting in one of the above mentioned FLAPS, not to
mention with with proper metric ends or pre-bent in the fashion shown in the
photo for easy UPS/Fedex/DHL, etc., shipment.  This is usually the pervue of
the VW Parts House, not usually on the nearby corner, like yer generic
FLAPS.  Sure, you could use two really long lines brought together with a
Union and yeah it will work, but wouldn't you rather have the correct
single length replacement line to begin with?

I have used many of these kits over the years and Bus Depot is not the only
outfit selling/shipping them to VW owners.  Wolfsburg West was the first to
offer them this way and CIP, VWG/Airhead Parts, Vintage Parts, BFY, Bill &amp;
Steves are among many others I know of that have followed along to offer
these very well made kits and in many cases individual lines as well - AND -
in usually all the PROPER lengths for the application needed.  The average
DIY owner usually does not know the exact lengths needed for his/her
application relies on the VW-specific supplier for this knowledge.  As an
example, I am asked several times a week what lengths are for a particular
application and I am only too happy help from my database I've compiled over
the past 25+ years.

Volkswagen themselves hardly offer individual lines, much less kits like
these anymore.  A look at their Fiche (or ETKA) will show that many (but not
all) lines are now being sold to the dealerships by their distribution
centers in 5 meter coils and the ends sold separately for the dealer
or consumer (ie: usually a shop) to cut, install the ends and properly
bubble flare the tubing ends.  Not something user-friendly for the DIY owner
these days.

Terry mentions a type of brake line that is easily bendable to the shape
desired and be able to &quot;relax&quot; back to apparently a straight shape again.
While I don't doubt such a line exists (it is the 21st century ;-)), I
haven't spotted any of this type at the local Autozone/Kragen lately.

As far as bending the typical steel line, in a pinch, I found using a
chain-link fence post works very well.  Just bend it slowly when doing
this.  I think Andy will be fine if he takes his time.

&gt; &lt;&lt;what is the best way to unbend and rebend steel brake lines?&gt;&gt;
&gt; You should have bought them locally with the right metric ends on them.  I
&gt; don't know what Ronnie is selling but at most local FLAPs there is such a
&gt; thing a flexible brake lines which will take bend and be able to relax
again
&gt; if needed.
&gt; Hope this isn't another one of his Genuine, Made in Taiwan, Germany
&gt; parts offerings.
&gt; Looks like you may be doomed here.
