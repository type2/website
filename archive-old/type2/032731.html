Subject: Re: clutch cable 

Volks,

I just finished a clutch job on Rosie, my 71 Westy.  The clutch cable is 
adjusted to the max and is just barely giving me pedal enough to shift.  I 
pulled it to check and lube it and re-installed...it's like new.  Before 
doing the clutch job I was going through cables about every 100-150 miles and 
they always broke  up front at the point where the cable was swedged into the 
clevis.  I'm thinking of putting in a spacer between the clutch adjuster and 
the stop to give me a bit more adjustment room.   Any ideas or suggestions 
will be welcome.  TIA   Frank in Sarasota
