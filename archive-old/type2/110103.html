Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor drive gear shims

Hello All   In all of my time I have never seen more than 2 shims under the 
dizzy drive. There have been cases of only 1 thicker shim but never 3 shims. I 
think you might measure a reg. case and compare with the aftermarket case and 
see what differences you find. I personal use one or the other but never both 
together. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  PS For you east coasters 
Naturalbus is less than aweek if you can don't miss
