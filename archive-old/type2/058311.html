&gt; Here's my issue - I'm having trouble trying to get the &quot;correct&quot; brake shoes

Scott, (and all)

I have a '73 and have put new shoes on it.  Did not notice any difference
between the shoes for it and those for my '78 or '78, but YMMV on that.
There were some changes up front in that period, but I think the rears
stayed the same from '72 up.  

What I think you are talking about is the pin that holds the parking brake
lever to the rear shoe.  This pin varies by manufacturer/remanufacturer. 
Some provide no pin and expect you wil re-use the old one, some provide a
pin with a groove and a clip for that groove, and some provide a rivet. 
Either the rivet or the groove and pine will do the job, but be careful,
some holes are bigger than other holes and you must match the fastener to
the hole size!  Ron (Bus Depot), Jim (Old Volks Home), or any good VWFLAPS
can get you pins and clips, which I think is what all of them came with. 

The one thing *not* to use is a nut and bolt!  I had that on the '73 when
I got it, and it came apart on the road.... what a racket!!  there was no
damage, but if it had gotten trapped between the shoe and drum or in the
linkage somehow, I would have been a MUCH sadder pup.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
