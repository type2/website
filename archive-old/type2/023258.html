&gt;Ok..if the general consensus is that the VDO gauges are inaccurate, then are
&gt;there any better solutions (without investing a small fortune) or are they
&gt;just par for the course?

Is it really important to know the exact temperature or pressure?
RPM and/or speed (approx.) is/are nice to know. The VDO gauge that 
indicates the oil pressure in my single cab has no scale at all, 
only a red area which is about where the oil light comes on. It tells 
me all I want to know about, I look at the position of the needle, just 
like I would do if it did have a scale. If you want, you can 'calibrate' 
it, like, visit someone who can really tell you the exact temperature 
or pressure, and watch the position of your gauge, just so you know. 
My 3 bar might not be the same as your 3 bar. Mechanical gauges might 
be more accurate.
