Subject: AVP Head...the piston
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey volks,
not looking to start any wars or anything, i just know
a few of you wanted to know exactly what was up with
the piston.  well i went to the VW garage where my
motor is this morning and took a look.  basically the
engine had all new bearings in it and the piston split
in half basically just above the wrist pin.  now from
what some of you have said, a piston could do this. 
now would this be a piston that has many many miles,
or is this possible from a basically new (&lt;7000 miles)
piston with new bearings all through the engine. 
coming from an idiots standpoint it would seem to me
from looking at the piston that the head of the valve
beat its way through the piston causing the piston to
separate.  the top half of the piston itself can still
move freely through the sleeve which would make me
think that even if it was still up when the valve
opened, it might beat up the valve a bit but it
certainly wouldnt be enough to break it off?  like i
said, thats an idiots interpretation, im no mechanic. 
however the mechanic who put the motor together and
has looked at it since doesnt feel the piston broke
first and he's been working on air cooleds for 30
years.  so that said ill stop whining to the list
about my misfortune but i thought id tell everyone the
condition of the piston.  im still up in the air as
what to do, ive heard valid arguments from both sides
of the fence, ill just have to think on it.  AVP has
seemed to care through all this and have encouraged me
to call them and discuss it further so im not bashing
them.  to end, i just wanted to say thank you to the
listees who emailed me with support and also their
technical no how.  i really appreciate it.
