      Having done a bit of research on electronic warfare, I can tell
you this:
    It won't hurt your battery, nor a generator, but will trash *true*
electronic ignitions, the ECU in FI cars. A Pertronix won't be hurt, I
don't think, and neither will points and condensor, but probably a
alternator and its regulator would die. Essentially anything with
solid-state components would be affected. You can keep spares safe by
wrapping them in the type of bags that RAM chips, hardrives, etc come
in, then a layer of bubble pack, and then either a good wrap of aluminum
foil, or put inside a dead microwave oven.
     So older buses will keep driving. I've been playing around with
making a electronic &quot;gun&quot; by putting the magnetron of a microwave oven
(it's in the correct frequency range of around 1ghz, and at 1500 watts
possibly has enough power) into an aluminum tube of the correct harmonic
length.  Similar devices were used aboard fighters in Desert Storm to
knock out enemy electronics. Of course the military doesn't use
magnetrons out of microwaves. 8-)  Haven't actually tried it since
people have told me that it might pose as much danger to me as to the
target.  I want to use it on people's cars with loud stereos.  8-)
