Ken,
        The Queen rules here in Christchurch, New Zealand.  She was in 
town last November.  People think that she's great in CHCH.  I am from 
Motown, but have been here long enough to get a NZ passport if I want.  I 
am not going to do this.  I'd have to swear something in support of her 
to get the little book.  No way.  Gary Gibson
