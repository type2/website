Subject: 1981 Westy A/C

My 1981 Westy is in the shop getting its motor rebuilt. The mechanic reports
that the York compressor broke a rod. IIRC the previous owner (my brother)
replaced the compressor once or twice during his ten year ownership. I've
seen that busdepot_dot_com has an adapter kit to replace the York compressor
with a Sanden. Should I put another York compressor in it? Is there an
advantage to the Sanden? Is A/C even a good idea on a 2 liter Westy? The
original motor went 125k with A/C. Not bad. And it sure is nice on those
long drives acroos Nebraska in the summer.
