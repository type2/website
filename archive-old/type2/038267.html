Subject: Bay Window Bra for Sale/Trade

I have a bra for a bay window bus that came with the bus when i bought it, 
that i do not use. So i thought i would see if someone on the list was 
looking for one. It looks like it is very close to new, i doubt if the guy 
used it more than once or twice. The bra says &quot;Wolf&quot; on it, so i am assuming 
that is the brand. If anyone is interested i will take any reasonable offer 
for the thing or i'd be willing to work out some type of trade for a swing 
out table and arm that would fit my 77.  Thanks.
