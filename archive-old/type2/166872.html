Subject: Re: having trouble opening my slidding door

Hey Sam, as Karl said, lube the U shaped piece at the back of the door.? Have a Bentley?? There's a good picture there of the 2 little holes to shoot some lube into.? Taking it apart to clean isn't too difficult either though, and you will probably have better results....



We were having problems with our 77 Westy lately too, so I took the door off, took everything apart and cleaned it all up really well, lubed it up and it opens like new.? It's amazing the difference.? It really pops open at the back, which it hasn't done before.



After doing that, I was inspired and tore into the passenger side door handle that was so difficult to pull open from the outside.? I really thought something was broken, but it was just so dirty and gunky and sticky with old grease.? Once it was cleaned, the door literally pops open.? It's great!? I found the article how to do the front ones in the Library tab on the type2_dot_com website.? There's also an article there from Steve Dolan about sliding door mantainence. 



As for shows, you just missed the Litchfield, CT show over Father's Day weekend, unless you were there, but there's a show this weekend in Woodstock CT, up in the Northeast corner coming up this weekend, and then Terryville show coming up in August.? Here's a link to the CTVWA's site.....? http://www.ctvwa_dot_com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=1





Also, if you are looking for some camping.... Limbo (www.limbobus_dot_org) has a great camping trip planned to southern Vermont called West River Westies, camping in Townshend, VT.? The campground is right on the West River and there is fun tubing on the river, along with the swimming etc.... We had? a great time last year and will be there again in 2 weeks!



Good food, good folks and lots of VW's.



Good luck and maybe we will see you at one of the events!
