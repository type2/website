Subject: Re: [T2] Don't forget to order clutch alignment tool!

Here is how we did it:
1) Take old clutch disk that you no longer need.
2) Cut a foot of broomstick.
3) Drive the broomstick through the center of the old clutch plate. You may 
have to trim it a bit to fit at first, but once you get it started a 4 lb 
sledge will drive it the rest of the way through. I supported the clutch 
disk on a couple of cinder blocks. It only took about a dozen whacks.
4) When done, it will fit the alignment notches quite well and you can use 
it again and again. You may want to trim the end down to a little more of a 
point to get it to center in the gland nut bearing, but that isn't super 
critical.

I still have the one my Dad made in 1973. It is only 6 inches long now 
because we kept &quot;fine tuning&quot; the end and it kept getting shorter.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I can still move the disk with a screwdriver or dowel. Move it a little,
&gt; &gt; &gt;eyeball it to see if everything lines up and when you're sure you've

&gt; &gt; &gt;positioned right, finish tightening down the bolts.

&gt; &gt; FWIW, I've found that a 3/8&quot; drive 10mm deepwell socket on an extension
&gt; &gt; works really well for this.
