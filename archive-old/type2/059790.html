Subject: Source: Main jets for Solex carbs

Hi Volks,
I have been lurking for the last couple months, but reading the digests when
I can.  I got a few weeks behind so felt any responses to the list would be
outdated.  Reason #1, my first kid, Shane, was born 5 weeks ago, and #2,
total brake rehab of the Turtle has been ongoing in my &quot;spare&quot; time.
Anyhoo, one of the listees, sorry, forget who, mentioned that jets for
Nippocycle carburetors might fit a 34PICT-3.  I looked into it and here are
the details.  Mikuni part # N100/604-xxx, where xxx is the jet size, fits
perfectly in the Solex.  Jets available from 80-240 by 2.5 increments.
Cost, $2.50. (I wonder what Gene Berg would charge).  Took 2 days for
delivery.  So see your ***da, ***ki, or ***ha bike dealer, Mikuni carb parts
should be in his book.
I will try a 135 in my 1641dp, 009, pertronix, single quiet pack exhaust,
otherwise stock motor.  I'll have a CHT in line and will let you know how it
works.
