&gt;David Schwarze you can stop laughing now.

Hey, I would never laugh at your plight.  Of course I should mention that
the threads on my GEX heads were also in poor shape.  I insisted on having
a pair with no helicoils, and got them, but the #3 spark plug went in real
tight and is probably stuck in there now.  I will probably tear the top end
of the engine down this winter and get the heads done properly (Mark
Stephens).  12K so far and no problems, but I don't trust those GEX heads
farther than I can throw them, and that's not far seeing as they are
attached to my engine at the moment.  When I remove them, that will be a
different story.

I also have to add that I always use anti-sieze on my plug threads and have
never noticed a problem.  My theory is better to run a little hotter than
have the spark plug stuck in the head.  Maybe one could also run a cooler
plug to compensate for the insulating properties of the anti-sieze?
