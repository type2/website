Subject: Solvang California Show

Hi all...

Just wondered how many of you Californians will be attending the Solvang
Vintage Volkswagen show in the beginning of October. I highly reccomend
Solvang.  It is unlike any other VW show, in that it is more of a family
atmosphere with really , really nice folks.. It is sponsered by the Golden
Gate Chapter of the Vintage VW Assoc of America, and although the emphasis
is on 1967 and earlier VW's... there are plenty, and I mean plenty of later
model air cooled VW's as well, not to mention some really nice Split Window
AND Bay Window's..   There is no engine blow up, no bikini contest, no
custom and modified classes... just beautiful stock restored VW's as far as
the eye can see...  The town is taken over by the VW folks, and it's a
blast to walk down the streets with tons of older air cooled VW's parked
everywhere in town.  It only takes place once every other year, which adds
to the special festive atmosphere.  Not to mention lots of vendors with
really hard to find parts, magazines, old vw ads, and the usual t-shirt,
caps and other promotional stuff.
