Subject: Re: [T2] Newly rebuilt engine wont run right

&gt; I have a 1973 Westfalia with a 1700, centermounted
&gt; Weber carb,

    Suspect the rubber boots that connect your center section of the
manifold to the runners. Severe vaccum leak there will cause poor idle
perhaps not even running.


&gt;but otherwise stock.  I rebuilt it last summer, and have slowly
&gt; been getting it going.  It runs now, but far from right.
&gt;
&gt; The engine will start, and rev up a bit, then fall off and try to stall a
&gt; few seconds later.  If I give it a little gas, it'll come back up and
&gt; eventually stay running, but rough.  I put a timing light on the ignition
&gt; wires, and each causes a flash every time like it should, so I know the
&gt; ignition is ok.  Another thing, when it does finally idle, it'll only run
&gt; about 2 minutes and then just fall off and stall.  I still cant find the
&gt; timing mark, so I dont know where the timing is, but its close enough now
to
&gt; run at least.
&gt;
&gt; I have dual exhaust, and the driver side exhaust comes out hot and loud.
&gt; The passenger side comes out relatively cold and quiet.


    I would verify that rough timing and firing order is absolutely right
before moving on. Find TDC #1 on power stroke (using pencil in sparkplug
hole as described in this list earlier in the month and look at rocker
arms/valve movement to assure you are on power stroke) once you have assured
you are at top dead center on power stroke, verify rotor is pointing to the
position on the distributor cap that is connected to #1 cylinder. This will
give you ball park idea that #1 will receive spark on its power stroke. From
there verify firing order.(I have seen these engine run better that you
would think with mixed up firing order)

       If you are still having problems after these two things, go back to
the real basics ..... Compression, Vacuum (check for leaks-Is your brake
booster hooked up and leaking vacuum?), Fuel (look at the plugs, are they
fouled or perfectly clean?), Spark- Are you getting a good hot spark at the
coil? At the plugs?, Timing (While you were establishing TDC #1 you may want
to make some basic marks for timing.)  and so on.  Hope this helps - Jeff


&gt;  I figure this means
&gt; one of the cylinders isnt firing.  But is the cold side not firing, thats
&gt; why its cold, or is the hot side not firing, and the extra gas is making
it
&gt; hot and loud?
&gt;
&gt; Im really lost here.  Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated.
Thanks!
