Subject: Fuel filter??
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990421171106.00a4ded0_at_pop-2.iastate_dot_edu&gt;

I'm a little confused about a component in the fuel path on my '81 Vanagon.
 A fuel line comes out of the tank into a black box (the fuel filter), into
the fuel pump, then into a cylindrical can.  I would think that the can is
a fuel filter, but why 2 fuel filters (one of which comes after the pump)?
Any help here???
