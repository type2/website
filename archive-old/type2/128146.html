Dan, i am not telling you to lower a bus or not. but i can tell you that
the very best way to improve handling on your bus is to leave it bone-
stock &amp; fix everything that needs to be fixed.

along with proper tires &amp; all suspension components in good shape, you
will be amazed at how well the bus handles at any speed.

speaking from experience.

good luck,
