Subject: Re: vacuum diagnostics: engine strong but manifold vacuum
  fluctuates

&gt; Well, I tried it and, low and behold, my vacuum reading - as measured
&gt; off the center of the intake manifold (Bug Auto-stick SP manifold w/
&gt; Vacuum port) - fluctuates rapidly between 10-20 inches of Hg.

Maybe your vacuum gauge is lying to you... can you borrow another one to
compare with?  Is the connection between gauge and manifold impeccable?

How about killing one cylinder at a time?  Hook up the gauge and pull
one spark plug wire while watching the gauge and listening.  Put that
plug wire back and pull the next one, etc.  This may not have a huge
effect on the gauge as the piston will still be sucking air, but if one
cylinder makes the gauge do something that the other three don't, you
have narrowed it down a little.

&gt; I tested compression and it came up the same for all cylinders -
&gt; around 125 - which is probably fairly reasonable for the ~6.9:1
&gt; compression I'm running.

Maybe it doesn't work this way, but 125 / 14.7 is about 8.5, not 6.9.

&gt; I'm about to pull the engine and reseal the jugs to the case, but if
&gt; there's other stuff I should be checking first...

Valve adjustment, maybe?  Also just watch the valve stems and rocker
arms while you turn the engine with a wrench - do they all appear to be
doing about the same thing?

&gt; I had the same problem w/ my current engine.  A friend at a show
&gt; somewhere, sometime, showed me the trick of putting a vacuum canister
&gt; in the line between the manifold and the gauge.  Needle stays steady
&gt; and you get accurate readings.

I'd call it an isolator, maybe.  Not quite the same thing as, say, a
fuel pressure gauge isolator, but close.  Many cars with vacuum operated
accessories (heater doors and cruise controls on many older cars) have
some kind of vacuum reservoir under the hood that could be used.  Many
GM cars had a black plastic sphere about 5&quot; diameter, and many Fords had
one that looked exactly like a tin can, about the size of a one-pound
coffee can.  Don mentioned the Wabbit one that was a series of small
spheres and was sometimes, literally, on the underside of the hood.

If you didn't have one handy, you could probably make one out of a
section of pipe, plus threaded end caps on each end to step down to a
pipe thread-hose barb adapter for the hose.  You need a decent amount of
volume; that 5&quot; sphere would be about 66 cubic inches.
