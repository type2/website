Subject: Re: [T2] Help identifying a part.... now a question

question....


&gt; Yah, the consensus seems to be a Ford starter relay used as a hot start
&gt; relay.  Karl suggested that it would be good to replace it with a
&gt; normal relay, since the Ford part is actually a solenoid that sucks
&gt; about as much juice as the Bus's starter solenoid.

when ford starter relays are used don't they replace the solenoid.  i am not sure 
(obviously) but on my split i thought years ago there was a ford starter installed 
'to replace something' in the 6 volt setup to get more juice and make starting 
easier.  what ever was done does seem to be effective. usually the bus starts easily 
provided all the ignition wires are connected!!! :-)
any shot in the dark clues on what really happened???
