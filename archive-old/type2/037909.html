Subject: Free Pop Top

Hello all.
	
A list member was kind enough to give me a pop-top for my 70 Westy. I
believe it is from an earlier model because it does not have the molded ribs
that my original had. I have since acquired the correct year Pop-top. If any
one wants the one I was given it is yours for free. I live in Brockton MA.
Additionally, I have a chrome inner cargo door handle for an earlier bus. If
any one wants to trade for one that will fit my bus, drop me a p-mail.

Jeff and Schlampig
