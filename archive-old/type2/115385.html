Subject: Re: [T2] '78 rough run / not start / backfire

Thanks, Dan . . .

Yes, I have the 'mexican' blue coil.  It looks so pretty!!

I will do that first, swap off this pretty blue coil for the work horse that 
was on the VW before.

While my friend and I were playing with the compression checks the first 
time, the ignition was left on for a bit of time.  I asked the other VW'er 
if the coil was hot.  He put  his hand on it and went &gt;&gt;&gt;  HOT!!!   I took 
his word for it  ;-)

It is just funky that the VW went bad just after I put the plugs in, but 
considering the circumstances (NGK plugs out because of reduced MPG, and 
Bosch Platinum in because I believe in them...) it could be the coil was not 
providing enough &quot;whatever&quot; to the NGK, and was just dying on the new Bosch 
Platinum's.

I will try this first because . . .  it is the easiest test to do !

Barry sends many thanks, this may be the answer....

&gt;I have had coils fail in the past that got bad when warm, and would cause
&gt;power loss and if enough cranking, a BIG backfire!  Bought 2 good bosch
&gt;coils (one for a spare) been good ever since.  Avoid the Mexican bosch blue
&gt;coils!
