Subject: '65 &quot;birth cert&quot; surprises

We *finally* got our &quot;birth certificate&quot; from the good folks at the
Stiftung VW museum today. It took almost 4 months.

There was one very, very interesting thing: the country of destination is
France, with a 397 M-code to back that up.

Everything that I have seen on the panel (and that's just about
everything, since it was/is a fairly involved restoration) is US: bumpers,
lights, etc.

So, it appears it was a US spec van delivered in France.

What are other folks' opinions/ideas on this?

Also, there is another M-code: 359, which I can't identify.

:-)

Jon
