&gt; My advice is the straight scoop comes from the Bentley, although it is not
&gt; such an entertaining read.  And you do not have to wade through all of the
&gt; various models and find all of the corrections in the appendix.
&gt;
The thing I really hate about the Bentley book is the lack of an index. I'm
sure some of us have the whole book memorized now, but having a
comprehensive index would make the book about ten times easier than having a
table on contents for each section and no index. Not very user friendly for
us simpletons...
