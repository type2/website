Subject: Where is Jim at OLDVOLKSHOME?
Message-ID: &lt;0ec2e2613171c59CPIMSSMTPU02_at_email.msn_dot_com&gt;

Hello list,  this is tom, owner of a '79 deluxe campmobile .  I have been
off the list since last summer.  My travels in the bus were great, living
out of it for several months in Colorado.  I have no time to report on the
bus,  I am wanting to get a hold of Jim at Sherwood motors , The
OldVolksHome in California.  Is he still in business?  I have tried the
phone number and Directory assistance, also his Internet adress,  no
luck.... I really enjoyed doing business with him.   I need to return or
exchange my VDO Tach, which no longer works, and my oil Pressure gauge Or
sender, neither of which worked from the get go....  Anyway I hope someone
has information concering Jim.\

Thanks Tom &amp; '79 deluxe
