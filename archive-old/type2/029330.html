lil stevie dolan writ
&gt;&gt;&gt;pushbutton &quot;cloaking device&quot;.  I didn't think this was ever installed on
&gt;buses, tho it was this way on my '71 stupid beetle (tm), or (b) a circuit
&gt;that lit the lamp while the car was starting (in early bay windows (per
&gt;bentley, I ain't owned one))

My '68(late) and '69 both have the pushbutton tester or romulan cloak
enabler as Ive come to realize through these informative posts.
