Subject: Re: [T2] Is that racket a blown engine?

&gt; a metal sounding rod touched to the heads between the valve rocker 
&gt; arms did &gt; not sound abnormal, so i believe it is on the main crank 
&gt; somewhere.....

Most likely your piston has broken a ring land and you've scored a
cylinder, thats about what happens when they get really hot. (been there
done that).
If it is blowing oil out from every engine seal and out your dipstick
then its probably a broken ring.
If it hasn't got bad crankcase pressure then look to a bent push rod or
loose rocker arm.
