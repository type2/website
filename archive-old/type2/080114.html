Subject: Re: [T2] lock adjustment

Hiya Chris,

When I was in Basic Training I remember my drill sergeant telling (screaming 
at) us that our M-16s were made to chamber a .556 round, NOT a .556 round and 
a bunch of crap.  The moral of the story was to keep it clean.
And this applies to the locksets on your Bus.  I found that cleaning them out 
(it's really surprising how much dirt can accumulate in these things after 
thirty years) and thoroughly lubricating them is 95% of the battle.  These 
parts (IMHO) are overbuilt and tough as a rock.  Once cleaned (and, perhaps, 
adjusted a little) they should last you another thirty years.
Advice.......do one door at a time to avoid mixing up parts.  The outside 
handset is separate from the door latch mechanism.  Both should be removed 
and the internals cleaned out.  Lubricate with Tri-Flow (a spray lubricant 
(smells like bananas - yum) recommended by my local locksmith).  This stuff 
has done an incredible job for me.  Be sure to use Locktite on the screws 
holding the latch mechanism when you reassemble.
