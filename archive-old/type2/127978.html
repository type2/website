&gt; Where does it go?  I have the three wires that go to
&gt; the connector and the wire for the brushes.  Where's
&gt; the black one go?

In my 73, there are five wires: black, brown, green and two reds (a fatter one 
and a thinner one). The brown, green, and thin red ones go from the regulator 
to the alternator. The black wire, which shares the connector post with the 
fatter red (starter) wire, goes to the test network central plug just inside 
the rear engine hatch in the upper right corner (T20 in the Bentley manual - 
Section 4-G).

Do you have a brown wire? What is it connected to on the alternator?


&gt; Also, is there some shrink wrap or protecting shield
&gt; around the connection for the brushes?  Mine is bare.

Yeah, so is mine. The PO filled the brushes connector plug with silicon.
