&amp;gt; A good friend has sent me a couple of links that tell how acetone - in
small quantities - will raise your fuel mileage. Anyone know if this is
for real? Surely might be expensive to test this on a modern fuel
injected vehicle only to find out 10K miles later that your fule pump and
injectors have turned to jelly inside... &amp;lt;griN!&amp;gt;

Seeing as how engines were designed to run on gasoline, additives such as
acetone are probably not a good idea for the reason that you discussed
above.  Acetone dissolves paint, so if you have any coatings inside your
fuel system it will attack them.  It probably isn't good for the hoses or
seals, either.
