OK Folks,

I managed to mess up here.  I send additional detail on simple tests one
can do on a used radio to Mr. Atwell and managed to ignore the rest of the
list.  Since others have expressed intrest in this area,  here's a cut and
paste of what I sent to him on car radio tests.  There is much, much, more
that can be said about radios, but it can be considered a bit off topic in
some circles.  So here goes nothing:

&gt; &gt;Your radio is a 12 volt negative ground one. How can I be so sure? It
&gt; &gt;says +12V on the black blob just above the spade lug!
&gt;
&gt; What would a pos. ground say there?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Now how about the ground... that's a little harder, as the wires in the
&gt; &gt;lower part of the pix are partly hidden. As it is a monophonic radio, at
&gt; &gt;least one of those two blurry wires is likely to be a wire for the
speaker.
&gt;
&gt; The blurry wires are for the speaker.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The other could be a ground wire or the wire for the antenna connection,
&gt;
&gt; There is an opening for the antenna at the other end of the back.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I'd have to see the ends of the wires to be sure. Can you take a pix
&gt; &gt;showing the entire rear side of the radio? That'd help a lot. Then I can
&gt; &gt;get a lot more specific. 
&gt;
&gt; The other spaded lug is attached to the body (spot welded or so). There's
no label on it.

A positive ground radio would very likely have a minus (-) sign in the
location where the plus sign is now. By the way, that welded-on spade lug
is for a ground wire for vehicles with plastic dashes. VW buses come to
mind :-)
 
By the way, it is quite likely that the radio has a protective diode
running from the plus connection to ground. It is there to blow a fuse
should the radio be hooked up incorrectly, as in swapping the + and -
wires. To find out if it is there, simply take a Volt-Ohm-Meter (VOM)
(You've got one in your tool box for testing the Fuel Injection haven't
you?) set it to it's lowest Ohms scale, short the probes and adjust the
Ohms adjustment for zero ohms. Make sure the radio is turned off. 
 
Take and ground the black lead to the metal case and touch the red lead to
the +12V spade lug. The should be no meter movement when you do this. If
the meter jumps to zero, then slowly drifts backwards, and then stabilizes,
there is an electrolytic capacitor in the circuit. It's there to filter out
electrical noise riding on the power wires. All is good so far. Now reverse
the leads. If there is a reading of say 50 ohms or less, the protective
diode is present. This is also good.
 
Other initial tests: If there was a zero or near zero reading regardless of
which position the meter leads were in, then there is a short in the radio,
and it must be sent in for repair. If the radio passes the diode test
above, try turning the power switch on, reground the black lead to the
radio case, and touch the +12V spade lug again. There should be a reading
greater than 10 ohms or so. Much less will probably blow a fuse. Again, if
the meter jumps to zero and then drifts backwards, the meter is reading an
electrolytic capacitor. All is ok, IF the meter needle settles to a value
larger than 10 ohms or so. If it passes this test, it's time to hook it up
for the smoke test.
 
Before you do that though, there is one other thing. I have mentioned
electrolytic capacitors a couple of times. Be aware that all radios have
electrolytic capacitors in them, particularly in the audio and power supply
sections. The chemistry in electrolytic capacitors has a tendency to dry
out over time, especially if they haven't been used over several years. If
the radio sounds tinny after turning it on or doesn't do anything at all,
leave it on for awhile. It may heal itself back to working order. Otherwise
it's time to go to the radio fix it shop. 
 
Noisy controls are a different thing though. Ya gotta pull 'em apart and
clean the little wiper arm and carbon track with alcohol, just like we do
with the Air Flow Meter on fuel injection engines. 
 
Connecting: In connecting the thing up, regardless if it is in a positive
or negative ground vehicle, just make sure that the plus terminal of the
battery somehow gets connected to the plus terminal on the radio (via
whatever fuses &amp; switches you may have) and another wire from the negative
side of the battery somehow gets connected to that welded spade lug and
you're all set. Don't forget the speaker and antenna though! In fact
connect them first. On my ex 1976 Westy, I ran a wire from one of the grond
lugs behind the dash to one of the bolts on the case of the radio. Then I
ran a wire from a convienent hot point on the fuse block and used an
in-line fuse. My Radio Shack special worked first time. If your new radio
passes the above tests, you're quite likely to do the same as well.
