Subject: Bus for Sale, how much should I ask?

I have a '77 bus (automatic), green and white on top, good overall shape
(small dent on front passenger side 'nose', small amount of body rust.)
Engine replaced 2 years ago. 

What would be a fair price for it?

Better, faster, cheaper:  choose any two.
