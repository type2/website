Subject: Carb'd 79 no start

All,

Yesterday I reconnected the choke on my Weber progressive in preparation 
for cold weather.  After I did so, I started the engine, and watched the 
choke to ensure it was working correctly, which it did. I took it for a 
test drive to ensure all was still well with the carb, which it was.  
Today I went to start it, and it did.  The engine ran for about 3 
minutes, and stalled.  Then I could not restart it. I checked all the 
connections to ensure that none had been disturbed during my work 
yesterday. I checked for spark. I checked to ensure gas was getting first 
to the carb, and then down the throat of it.  Everything checked out 
fine.  Being that I was short on time, I took the wifes car.  Both she 
and I think maybe it is flooded, so I will try to restart when I go to 
dinner later this evening(I work in the evenings). Hopefully that will 
correct the problem.  But assuming that does not correct the problem, 
what does the collective suggest as my next target for investigation?

Waiting with breath baited,

David
