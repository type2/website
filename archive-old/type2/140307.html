Subject: Re: [T2] Exploded air flow meter and my new parts bus

From Eddie:

The owner said it had a 2.0 from a '76 &lt;snip&gt;
It had the later style with the extra pin (temp sensor) and the one I brought was the older  ...damn... I
guess it has a later than '76 fuel injection system. So I then proceeded to remove and open the AFM in
question. When I opened it I realized that the bottom (YES, the bottom) had been blown (?) off. If you flip
over an AFM you notice that the bottom is a metal plate that is riveted to the housing and sealed with a
rubbery sealant ( the same kind of sealant used on the top cover). On this one, that bottom plate was bent and
4 of the rivets had pulled out. It looked like something in it had exploded.
&lt;snip&gt;
 How in the hell can this happen to an AFM? It had been sitting for 5
years, being started once in a while. Could a backfire cause that kind
of force?

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 6 pin AFM was used on 75 and early 76 up to the end of 12/75.
4 months of 6 pin and 8 months of 7 pin.

I bet there is a hose clamp on every hose going to and from the big S hose.....

This is why [I believe] VW NEVER put hose clamps on those hoses.
The hoses should blow off 1st to protect the AFM.
