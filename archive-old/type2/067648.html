Subject: Stolen Bug Story

Last Friday, the morning after Halloween, my friends in Des Moines, Iowa
woke up to finding out their bug was stolen - a nice black 62 with
roofrack. But since they work out of their home, a cafe, they didn't
notice it was gone until about 1 P.M. when they needed to run some
errands. Needless to say they were very upset. This isn't a show car
but  a very nice daily driver - probably the only 62 in regular use
around here..

I happened to walk in to their cafe around 2 P.M. and into this story. I
sat around talking with them until the police officer (detective) showed
up. They related the story to him. He said it was the first time anyone
had reported a bug stolen (at least to him - he was maybe late 20s)!
Well living in the midwest nowadays, you don't see many around anymore..
He seemed optimistic about recovery - we were too - after all there
isn't a market for stolen beetles - and they stick out like a sore thumb
- - especially a black 62 with a roofrack.

In the meantime we got in my Jetta and drove around the neigborhood
(they live close to downtown) for half and hour, covering about a mile
radius.. No luck.. no black bug.

It was getting around 3:30 P.M. and I had to go back to work. I told
them to call if they found out anything..

At 5:00 P.M I got a page.. It was them. I called and found out indeed
the black 62 bug had been found. About 1 mile from their house.. Four
&quot;kids,&quot; two of them 18, the others younger. Their joy ride was
interrupted by a police car listening to the report on his radio of a
stolen black bug. The kids were stopped, and the older two were
arrested, swearing someone had &quot;given&quot; them the car.. Four squad cars
surrounding a 62 black bug - no longer with a roofrack..

The police seemed very pleased with themselves. The two 18 year olds
were charged with Theft - and went through court the next morning - and
found themselves with $3250 bail set on each. I say this because I'm a
bail bondsman. And no - I didn't post bond for them. But they didn't
call. Its good that they didn't. I would have felt a conflict of
interest - I probably would have turned them down.. Or charged them alot
of money :)

In the annals of local crime this was probably the quickest recovery of
a stolen car in this area- especially a black 62 bug.. Anybody seen a
roofrack for sale in the black market?
