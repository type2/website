&gt; James,
 
&gt; Now on to some personal opinions about this subject.  I would NOT use a
&gt; dinky 30-amp relay.  Drain your battery good and dead and use thick wire
&gt; and it will fry.  Not to say that you shouldn't use thick wire - you
&gt; absolutely should.  The problem is related to what the Captain said - when
&gt; your aux battery is very dead it will draw a huge number of amps initially
&gt; when it is connected to the starting battery.  Easily 100 amps or
&gt; more.  This will taper off within a few seconds to ~30 amps and within a
&gt; couple minutes to around 10 amps (assuming a standard group 24/27 &quot;deep
&gt; cycle&quot; RV/marine battery).  That initial current surge will eventually fry
&gt; your buck-and-a-half 30-amp relay.  Maybe not this month or even this year,
&gt; but eventually it will go.

David,

If the wires connecting the two batteries are small will this relay failure
still be likely to occur?
