Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78


Not even Bosch can rebuild a Bosch FI fuel pump. Watch out for that $127
rebuild by who????? If you want the most money when your 60, pay the price
for a new Bosch pump now. Compromise is great risk of pain for your wallet. 

You wallet just ain't deep enough to carry the freight??? Bust ass, get an
evening part time job. If you ain't got enough time/money to make it work
for sure, how do you justify throwing away money on cheap?????? 

Hit a junkyard, take your chances. Look for a possible newer replacement
pump on a ratty chassis. Sometimes you get lucky. The risk is quick failure
of an old pump that has been inactive for more than a year. Might work a
week, might work for an hour, might not work at all. You risk all with
hopin' and guessin'. You risk nothing with a new Bosch pump, if you install
it correctly, and put in a new filter to insure results. 

Criminy, if you can afford 5 vehicles, two of which are less than 4 years
old,  how is it you can't afford a new pump, how is it you can afford to
throw money at squeeky cheap on the VW so's you can make the mortgage
payments on the newer rides,????

&gt;Fellow Bus owners:
&gt;
&gt;I have figured out that my fuel pump is locked up or
&gt;something. I took it out and it whirs, but it will not
&gt;pull gas.  Is there a way of fixing it?  Paying $127~
&gt;for a rebuilt pump is out of my league right now.  I
&gt;have bid on one on Ebarf and some guy bids it up
&gt;higher.  Anyways, anybody have a used one for sale for
&gt;cheap, That works?  Can I cut mine open, free the
&gt;obstruction or rust, and have my room mate tig weld it
&gt;back together?
&gt;
&gt;Any Ideas? Any Help?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
