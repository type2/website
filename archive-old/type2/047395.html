Subject: [T2] Broken MC Brake Fluid Resevoir
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;I've returned to the listto ask for help in finding a brake fluid reservoir
(positioned
&gt;on top of the MC) for my 77 bus.

&gt;I was trying to remove the old one from the dying MC so I could install
&gt;it to the new MC when I did a fine job of breaking one of the nipples
&gt;off of it.

I recently did the same thing on my 72 bus.

&gt;I tried every junk yard I could think of here in Hawaii with
&gt;no success.

Did you try Way Out Salvage in Arkansas? (www.wayoutsalvage_dot_com)  I bought mine
from
either them or from Bus Boys in Redding CA as a used item - yes, I'm quite sure
I got
one from Bus Boys.

Either way, I haven't installed my new one yet, what I did was install the
broken one
complete with broken nipple, then hold it tightly down on the MC while binding
really
good with mechanics wire to the MC. It was designed as a stop gap measure to
pass inspection - it has held fluid and hasn't leaked in 5 months now, but I'm
going in
to swap on the good one since I have to replace the rubber grommets between the
top and
bottom resevoir and upgrade my servo hose to the expensive one.
