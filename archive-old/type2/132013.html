Subject: New lights are blowing fuses.

I tried hooking up some newer side marker lights on my 77 Rivera after
crushing the older ones against a tree and when I hook them up, the fuse
blows.  Any tips of why this is happening?  I'm hooking up the positive wire
up and hooking the negative wire to the metal plate in the new light, I
don't see why it shouldn't work without blowing fuses.
