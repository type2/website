&gt; The only thing I can think of is while checking out the brake lines, there was

&gt; original.  Anyone think maybe the old line is flexing when I get things heated
&gt; up?  Or do the lines ever feel the heat?

If the flexible hoses that connect the metal lines to the wheels are
original or even close to being original then you have found your problem.
These lines fail from the inside by swelling.  Fluid is getting past the
swollen section but not returning.  Then the next time you apply the
brakes more fluid gets forced past the constriction resulting in uneven
application.

I would advise that you replace the flexible hoses to all four wheels.

                             OOK!
