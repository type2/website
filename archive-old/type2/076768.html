don't know don't have any personal experience with engines from you guys
but you have decent reps.

I had mine done by a local machinist who used to work for VW and was
trained in Germany by VW on rebuilding engines..  unfortunately he did not
want any more work than found him and this past Jan he retired from the
business.  (Bruce at RJ Loock in Baltimore)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been reading some of the things posted on the list about GEX.  All
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; them have been bad comments.  I was looking at there website b/c I need
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; new engine for my bus. After what I heard I don't think I will buy from
&gt; them
&gt; &gt; &gt; but could someone tell where I could get a good 2 liter from for my 72
&gt; bus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; first you need a core or old motor... check junk yards etc, sometimes
&gt; &gt; folks here have blown engines that are basically decent they let go cheap.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; now that you have a core.  check your wallet.  how much work are you
&gt; &gt; willing or able to do yourself....
&gt; &gt; figure a two liter rebuild from a decent core will run you at least
&gt; &gt; $1200-1500 base and go up as you do other jobs or farm out some of the
&gt; &gt; work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; to give you an idea, about year and a half ago I rebuilt mine.  cleaned
&gt; &gt; case. balanced crank. new cam, new pistons and cyl.  all new bearings etc.
&gt; &gt; had the heads cleaned and new seats and valve guides installed. lot of
&gt; &gt; little things that added up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; paid to have the bottom end done by a good machinist with VW
&gt; &gt; experience. did the top end myself..._dot_came up just short of $2,500
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope to get at least 100k miles on this engine before major work needs
&gt; &gt; to be done again...
