Subject: Re: [T2] '72 poptop canvas

It's quite possible that the number Ron used for that Poptop Canvas was what
we in the &quot;biz&quot; call a &quot;bastard&quot; VW number (one that is made up for
&quot;expedient&quot; or necessary reasons). It is usually done when a vendor offers
something that may not have been available as a separate item (such as the
Doors on the Electrical/Water Connection Boxes, which were never available)
or to differentiate separately sourced replacement items or to even identify
a possible &quot;close-out&quot; inventory item (or items). It's done more often than
not.
 Ron has sourced Poptop canvases from more than one source in the past
(Acme, PLF, etc.,) and rather than getting the inventory mixed up with other
sourced ones, it may have been given it's own part number to differentiate
it from others. Best bet is to contact Ron to verify what the application it
truly is (or was at the time).

&gt; &gt; It's time to sell it, but I'm a bit puzzled by the part number,
&gt; &gt; which doesn't seem to match any currently at BD. I just can't
&gt; &gt; recall now what &quot;flavor&quot; it was - I paid $225. P/N 231-702-207
&gt; &gt; color gold. Can anyone give me any info on which &quot;flavor&quot; it is so
&gt; &gt; I can accurately represent it for sale?

&gt; That number doesn't match the number in their printed catalog:

It also doesn't match my campmobile fiches (incomplete for all model
&gt; years).
