Subject: RE: [T2] Modern Brake Switch

Actually, your not very far off another thing that I'm planning on doing. I
plan to install a flashing third brake light.
I've come to realize that most people are now almost totally dependant on
seeing that third light to recognize that you're braking. I figure that if I
make it flash, its more likely to get their attention.

&gt; &gt; I've had too many close calls with the standard slow responding switch
&gt; &gt; mounted on the master cylinder. I figure a modern switch would give
those
&gt; &gt; tailgaters another second of warning to start to react sooner.
&gt;
&gt; If you want really quick reaction, install a switch the lights the brake
&gt; lights when the throttle is closed.  That way they'll see the lights
&gt; without having to wait for your foot to reach the brake pedal!
&gt;

A randomizer that just flashes the brakes whenever would  keep the
tailgaters on their toes. :)
