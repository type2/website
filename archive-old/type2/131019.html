Subject: Stock alternator current?

Hey guys-

Anybody know the current rating of a stock 73 alternator?  Im thinking
somewhere between 35A and 50A just from intuition.  Im hoping that I might be
able to run a A/C inverter and get a TV and DVD going before I have the money
to upgrade the charging system.  They dont draw all that much and I cant think
of what the bus does with its power beyond ignition and headlights...

Thanks a lot
-ToM
