Subject: Air flow meter &lt;---&gt; control unit compatibility

I had some FI trouble and suspected my CDI as the source of the trouble. I
rewired to stock ignition only to find that my fuel pump was the problem. During
my original troubleshooting, I replaced the control unit with another when the
rewiring failed to solve the problem. Now my bus is stock ignition, new fuel
pump, but with the new control unit. I know that the new control unit comes from
a non-california bus, whereas my original was a Cali (despite having been
converted to 74 exhaust without O2 sensor). Now the bus runs like heck (whereas
previously it ran well but stalled when the fuel pump pooped out). I happen to
know the mechanic that replace the fuel pump timed and adjust air mixture to get
it running. I know my air flow meter is not original (cali or not). I also know
that my new/used control unit is non-cali. I suspect that I may have had a
non-cali air flow meter calibrated to function best possible with a cali control
unit.

My questions:
1. Are air flow meters particular to control units?
2. Can I calibrate?
3. How can I tell if the two are compatible?

Bob
