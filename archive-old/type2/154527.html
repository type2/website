Subject: Filtering fuel

I've been suffering from crud in the fuel tank for the last couple of 
months. Fuel filters are lasting about 50 miles if I'm lucky. Fortunately I 
don't do vital long drives so this hasn't been too much of an issue, indeed 
after about 8 changes, I'm getting really good at changing them !

Anyway, I plan to empty the tank next weekend as it will be down to the 
quarter mark according to my fuel gauge - although what I really have in 
there will be interesting to find out.

My plan is to decant the fuel into cans, filter it and tip it back in. 
Repeat until the stuff coming out is clear. I think the crud is rust but it 
started very suddenly after 9 years of no problem, which makes me 
suspicious.

My questions ins, what do I filter it with ? My thoughts initially are to 
use muslin or another fine material. Filter papers from chemistry sets 
aren't readily available but coffee filters are - would they be better ?

And if you are saying &quot;Just dump the gas&quot;, I'm in the UK and we are 
currently paying about 8 dollars a gallon so I'll save what I can if 
possible. Taking the tank out isn't an option either at present as I need 
the car on the road.

The filters I use a cheap plastic ones. I know there is a glass type as 
well - these look like they can be dismantled and presumably cleaned. Are 
these a better idea ?

Thanks

Phil
