&lt;&lt; If you have to carry spare parts for daily driving, you are

 procedures, you are insuring success and don't need to carry
 any spare parts. You can leave those spares on the garage shelf
 in case they are needed at the next scheduled inspection. &gt;&gt;

I'm all for scheduled maintenance, but time and unforseen occurance can be a 
mother.  Often, parts can just fail for no reason at all.  I don't see 
anything wrong with carrying  an extra fan belt, or the like, along, just in 
case.

That seems a little like not carrying a spare tire because you just bought 
new tires a week ago.  :)

But I do agree with scheduled maintenance.  A lot of problems you can see 
&quot;happening&quot; long beforehand.  But let's face it...Sometimes...things just 
break.
