Subject: Help- 74.5 Westy Purchase (sorta long)

I was told today by some lady in Massachusetts that the VW I am thinking of
purchasing is a half-year model.  It is advertised as a 75, but it has the
stove/fridge combo behind the passenger seat, and I am told that the model
switched half-way through the year to having everything behind the driver
seat.  Will this be a problem for me in getting parts, etc?  Here are the van
specs:
- -New Paint, original color, sort of a Tennis Ball type color
- -Good material on the bed, the back seat, the passenger seat, Driver seat has
small rip.
- -Brand New Engine - 10 miles on it (BTW are there special &quot;breaking in&quot;
things I need to do?)
- -Interior, i.e. stove, sink, fridge, are taken apart and set on the floor
inside, need to be put back together, possibly some parts replaced, 
- -cabinet on left rear side is not original
- -California Van, from San Diego, so virtually NO rust anywhere, a friend w/a
69 bus went with and checked it thoroughly, there were a couple spots where
tiny spots were forming.
- -cost $3200

I am new to the game, spent the summer in Detroit and tried to buy one there,
exorbant prices, much rust.  I am very excited about this van, possibly
because of the fact that it is what I WANT, but if it is going to be a
sinkhole, I would like some objective advice.
