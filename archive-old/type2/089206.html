Subject: 70 tent

    I was just wondering what I can do to keep the tent from falling down as
I drive. The problem is the rear section. It keeps dropping down and it
obscures my view to the rear and if someone is sitting there, it is right in
their face. I tuck it in, but it falls down a short time later.
    Just wondering what solutions y'all have found.

    Also, I got my Wynstar tires. They are the correct size and 8-ply. They
seem to be doing fine. I have noticed a bit better handling than when I had
passenger tires on. My FLATS was able to get them and they ran me $68+tax.
    Just thought I'd pass that along

Later,
