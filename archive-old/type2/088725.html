Subject: Just ordered from Bus Depot

Well guys, wish me luck, just ordered a Brazilian master cylinder from Bus
Depot for 29 dollars new!! Now that's a good price! We'll see how long it
takes to get here to B.C. Canada. Shipping was under 8 bucks too. My last
order has unfortunately gone missing in the mail (not BusDepot) and was
supposed to arrive airmail in 3-5 days. So far it's been 5 weeks. I'm
guessing it's gone. 400 bucks down the drain, as no insurance on it. Doh!!
Time to start saving again!!! I never thought US Mail would actually require
insurance. My thought was if they are entrusted to deliver a package, they
are legally responsible to do so. Why should it require more money on top of
postage??
Courtney
