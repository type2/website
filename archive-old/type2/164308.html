Subject: Pulling heads, engine still in the vanagon

Greetings...... as I go round and around about how to proceed with repairs,
I am leaning towards attempting to replace a cylinder head on my 81 air
cooled vanagon, without pulling the engine. Got lots of help as to how to
pull the engine, and it doesn't seem that difficult, however.....

I am just wanting to solicit words from anyone who has actually replaced a
head, still in the van. I get the feeling it can be done, but beyond that, I
have no idea what I am in for, so if you have done it, I would surely like
to hear from you.

This would be the fastest way to get my van back on the road before the fall
camping season arrives. Might not be the best long term, but I think I am
willing to do the quick fix, and deal with the long term fix, in the dead of
winter, when there is nothing much going on anyway.

I am guessing that but for the tin and the heat exchangers, its much the
same for an air cooled as a waterboxer?

As I read Bentley, and try to imagine the process, I am unable to envision
if I have to pull the exhaust and intake from both sides, or will removing
it from the one head, allow each to move far enough, to allow the head to
come off?

Any words of experience would be most appreciated. I know most here run
buses. Just hoping to find some vanagon folks who have btdt....

Thanks,

John
