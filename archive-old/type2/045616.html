Problem Solved!

yes, backed out to the top of the adjusters.
I actually ordered wrong or was shipped the wrong shoes from 
BusDepot. The ones I got at my local place are an almost exact match.

thanks

&gt;&gt;I am replacing the rear brake shoes on my 71 type 2.  The ones I 
&gt;&gt;ordered from bus depot were slightly longer and had a tapered end 
&gt;&gt;where they sit in the adjusting star slot.  They were also a bit 
&gt;&gt;narrower.  It looked like small differences so I went ahead and put 
&gt;&gt;them on.  With my adjusting stars backed in all the way, the brakes 
&gt;&gt;are too big, ie the drum will just barely fit, and is rubbing too 
&gt;&gt;strongly to fit.

&gt;Is your emergency brake completely off?
