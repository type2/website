Subject: Re: [T2] Double Relay Lessons Learned

[...]
on the vanagons the ground is right under but hidden by the double 
relay.  Just the other day i helped on one where they wanted me to look 
at the vanagon outside our shop.  I reached in to check the double relay 
connections and realized that a wire was loose.  The ground wire that 
should have been held in by the screw holding the bracket was loose.  
Put it back under the screw and everything was fine.  As i had recently 
replaced  my double relay i opened mine up and double  checked mine  too.

&gt; Lesson 1
&gt;
&gt; In the 79 Bus, unlike earlier FI buses, the double relay solenoid 
&gt; ground return (pin 85) passes through the ECU and then to the hidden 
&gt; engine ground under the air manifold.
