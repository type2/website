&gt;Don't you mean REDUCED exhaust emissions?  Could you please explain how
&gt;smaller intake valve size achieves this?
Yes - I meant that the larger valves (while providing better breathing (= marginal power) did not have the required emissions.  The smaller intake valve increases intake velocity (slightly better swirl), but with less volume.
&gt;Again, how does 4 valves per cylinder help emissions?  
If properly engineered, 4-valve (or more) per cylinder provides better swirl and more efficient combustion (albiet with more complexity); increasing specific output without increasing emissions.
&gt;&gt;Toyota has had this technology in all plain-Jane sedans since the '80s).

&gt;Why the 78 over the other years?  76-79 all had the same intake valve size.
The '79+ years (air cooled) had the smaller intake valve sizes.  The '78 had the 2L displacement, less complicated/rare (than '79+) heat exchangers, hydraulic lifters, bigger intake valves and FI.  Best stock engine combo IMO.
