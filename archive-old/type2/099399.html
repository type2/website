Subject: Re: [T2] GLAND NUT QUESTION

For Type I motors, stock install is with a felt ring seal to reduce loss of 
lube from or entry of contaminates to the pilot bearing. Bosch 005 
Distributor lube is stock grease for the pilot bearing. A toothbrush amount 
is considered good rule of thumb for quantity to pack a new bearing. Set 
the bearing, pack it with grease, then set the seal ring and give it a few 
drops of oil. Do it on a press prior to installing the flywheel or with a 
drift after. Some clutch pilot tools are designed both as a pilot and seal 
setting drift and disk setting device, all in one.

&gt;Question: Does the gland nut normally have an o-ring on it? My sources 
&gt;have conflicting answers.
