Subject: [T2] &quot;sticky&quot; shifting

One question before I can get this 69 Westy on the road.

The shifting is really hard.
It goes into gear, but you have to force it the whole way, and it stops 
wherever you leave it.

It's as if the bottom of the shifter is loaded with frozen tar, making any 
movement in any direction nearly impossible. Make sense?

Anyone have this happen? Where should I start to check?
