Subject: Re: [T2] no spark 

Hi Jason, 

Obvious things to check are correct seating of the distributor cap and correct allignment of the HT leads to the spark plugs; its woth double or ttriple checking... 

Have you tried removing the coil to distributor HT lead at the distributor end and holding it 2mm from the crankcase (grasp by an insulated part of the wire) and see if there is a spark when the engine is turned over? 

If no spark then its possible you still have a problem with the HT lead (silcon leads do not have a long life), check its seated in the coil too. 

If you get a spark then the problem is in the HT side of the distributor. Could be worn out ((or stuck pushed in) carbon contact in the centre of the cap, or worn contacts on the rotor arm, or if rev limiting rotor arm used then the rev limiter may be stuck in the on position could be a hair line crack in the distributor cap earthing the HT too. 

Problems with the HT side of the system can sometimes be detected by looking at the engine in the dark then when someone tries to 
start it the HT leaking to earth can be seen as a blue light show flickering over the HT componants. 

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; hey everyone,
&gt; 
&gt;    I am not getting any spark out of my coil.  i checked the points and 
&gt; adjusted them.  i replaced the coil, the condensor, and the voltage 
&gt; regulator.  I checked all fuses.  still no spark.  I even ran a patch wire 
&gt; from the hot wire on the voltage regulator to the positive on the coil, to 
&gt; bypass the ignition switch, and still not working.  the engine turns over 
&gt; but nothing will spark...... help please
&gt;
