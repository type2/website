&gt;I'm missing the dowel pins that hold the main bearings in 
&gt;place against the case.  Anybody got some they'd part with 
&gt;for a fair price or know where I can get some?

I was just at my favorite VW machine shop and the guy told me the pins are
the same for the type 1 and type IV motors and he gave me a handfull.  So,
unless they're not the same, I'm set.

Thanks.
