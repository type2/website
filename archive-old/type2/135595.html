Subject: Re: [T2] Refurbished?

There used to be a shop in North Carolina named &quot;Red's&quot;. I bought a
car there. They sold mechanically sound cars on super easy payment
plans for real cheap. Transportation for the working folk you could
say.

Red definitely saved my bacon when my Z got stolen. I was broke, had
like $200 to my name, and he hooked me up with a 100k mile Nissan.

He didn't sell junk. Just solid beaters to get you around in. Good
guy. I really liked him.

I could picture him taking in old VWs and dropping rebuilt engines and
redoing all the suspension and brakes and selling them for reasonable
prices. And he'd make money at it too I suspect.
