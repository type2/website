Subject: Re: [T2] a few more questions

Some Wal-Mart's do carry it. I use it in my 81 M-B turbo &amp; when I put
the motor back in my bus will give it a shot in that motor. It is also
available in quarts as well as gallons. Locally (TN) I can find it at
Wal-mart, Advance Auto, &amp; Auto Zone.

&gt; As far as grade, that 30-wt non-synthetic is fine. Following some
&gt; suggestions on this list, I have switched from Castrol to Shell Rotella T,
&gt; which is working great, thanks guys. Two caveats: it's not sold in every
&gt; store--Wal-Mart doesn't have it--and it's not sold in quarts. It's intended
&gt; for large diesels that hold 11 to 13 gallons of oil, so it comes in gallon
&gt; jugs. NAPA has a neat little oil can that works wonders for the Rotella user
&gt; who doesn't need the whole jug.
