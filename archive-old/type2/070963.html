hmmmmmmmm......no drain plug....i  would find out about that soon.  if i ve
got it figured right you are looking at about 30+ yrs of old german gear lube
in there.......the plug is an &quot;indented&quot; plug meaning you need a special tool
to get it out......not a regular bolt head like a oil drain plug.....but
belive me you do have a drain plug.......keep looking
