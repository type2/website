Subject: Re: [T2] Marvel Mystery Oil (was oil additive advise)

Seems like paint thinner was $2 a gallon last I bought some at Home Depot. Should
I add a pint sortly before changing my oil? (gotta get my 40w out any day now!)

&gt; &gt; I am not sure what is in it but I was introduced to Marvel Mystery Oil in
&gt; &gt; 1965. Since this product is still in business they gotta be doing something
&gt; &gt; correct.
&gt;
&gt; I found the MSDS for Marvel Mystery Oil. MMO contains:
&gt;
&gt; * at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-refined mineral oil&quot;
&gt; * at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-dewaxed mineral oil&quot;
&gt; * and no more than 30 percent Stoddard Solvent (mineral spirits)
&gt;
&gt; That's all they listed. Motor oil with parts cleaner in it. Helluva concept,
&gt; and one that works extremely well.
