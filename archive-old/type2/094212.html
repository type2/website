&gt; I don't remember. All I know was that you could fit two bikes on the back
&gt; hatch of your bus with it, and it cost about $50.

&gt; Do you have something you know will work with a bus for about that, that
&gt; hollywood makes?

The Original F1B for around $60 or the Express F9 for $50 would work.
