On a realted note I have heard that the WCM rubber for the
cargo area pop out windows to be REALLY stiff so much so
that peeople have actually broken windows attempting to shut
them (push on the outside of the window ina n attempt to
shut it and crack :(   )

The WW stuff for the outer frames on the pop out windows is also the wrong
contour.  But I only think it would break the glass if you have laminated
glass.   I once broke a friend laminated vent window by pushing on the glass
to open it.    '61 bus.    :(    I didn't even push that hard.   I guess it
had never been oiled since his friend got it out of a junkyard.  [ Then I
flipped his bus on its side in a snow storm going over the Sierras in May
 about 4 years ago.    Ooops.   No traction.   (Should have stopped and put
on the chains we didn't have).   The tool box was not tied down and narrowly
missed my head.  There was a dent in the overhead vent.   Then I used AAA to
rescue us and flip the bus back up.   Then I found the closest VW place in
300 miles, and we drove with a bent trailing arm there,  worka wonka,  where
I bought a window for $10, and he let us take the parts we needed off a front
end he had, and we fixed the steering.]         Um- back to the rubber-  The
WW seals relax in a year or so, I am told.   Why can't they make ones with
the profile VW did, or import seals from Brazil, where VW still sells them?
