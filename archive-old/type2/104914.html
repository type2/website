&gt;Hi people,

&gt;I haven't been able to find a published torque spec for the oil pressure
&gt;sender on my '77 T4 engine.  It's NPT, so I'm nervous.  Anybody care to
&gt;estimate about how much torque?

I would take it easy on this one.  It doesn't need a whole lot of torque and you don't want to split/break anything.  I would probably stop at around 5 lb/ft.
