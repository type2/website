Subject: [T2] 75 Fuel Injection on a 78 engine?

Some time ago I purchaced a dead 1975 bus with a poorly rebuilt 1976
2000cc F.I. engine that had dropped a valve guide into the combustion
chamber. Tore it down for a rebuild and found the engine has two
different heads (different size valves and ports) and some other un-cool
things. I picked up a 1978 2000cc to replace the '76 with, but couldn't
get the control unit or the AFC for the 78. I did get everything else
involving the F.I. for the 78.

The 76 engine has the complete F.I. from the 1975 1800 including the ECU
and AFC.

My question is, can I use the 1975 ECU and AFC with all the 1978 parts
or should I move all the 1975 F.I. parts to the 78 engine? What are the
differences between these ecu and afc's? I know in an ideal world I
should get the 78 ecu and afc but with all these working parts and a dry
wallet I must make due with what I have for now. If the 75 and 78 parts
will mix ok for now, I hope to get the 78 ecu and afc later, but I have
to get this bus on the road before my other transportation dies.

Thanks for the help!
