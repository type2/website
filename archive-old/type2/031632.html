&gt; &gt;The cooling boot for the 55amp alt. is part # 021 903 655. It is still in 
&gt; &gt;production and available through a variety of sources. 
&gt; 
&gt; OK, for those of us who are ignorant, can someone explain what an alternator cooling boot is, maybe what it looks like and why it's good to have one?

this only applies to pancake engines in the first place so if you don't
have one don't worry about it.  72+

on the back of the alternator near where the wireing harness enters the
alt. there is a small rubber elbow that connects to the fan housing...this
directs a small amount of the cooling air through the alternator to help
cool it.

they were two different shapes the hard one to find was shaped like the
letter &quot;D&quot;  half round/flat on one side

if you have an upright engine you can safely ignore the above
