&gt; Did your bus come with EGR originally?  I'm not familiar with the system,

Possible. But I got all het up about nuthin'. When I got to the parts
place, she conceded that those elbows (639) have not been available for
a good long while now.

&gt; I know that the connection under the air cleaner is for the air pre-heat
&gt; valve, but my experience is limited to my own CJ engine, so I can't say for
&gt; sure about yours.

The good news is, I got the 637C elbows, my balance tube is back in
place, I've got power-assist brakes, my carb preheater vacuum hoses are
all hooked up, and I'm ready to go! Nowhere *to* go at the moment, tho,
except work. Wah.
