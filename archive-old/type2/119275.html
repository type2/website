Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild vs. LongBlock

&gt;   This is a Friday question.  I am looking for opinions of rebuilding 
&gt; vs.
&gt; purchasing a long block.  Rebuild costs seems to be within $100 or 
&gt; $200 of the
&gt; cost of a rebuilt longblock, so, is it worth it to do the rebuild.

One advantage a long-block or a shop doing a long-block install might 
have could be a warranty.  I certainly gave that a lot of weight when I 
made the decision to purchase a rebuilt long-block and have it 
professionally installed, rather than getting a top-end rebuild on my 
old engine.  (Top-end rebuild was only a few hundred bucks less than 
the complete long-block replacement.)
