The easiest thing is to check the coil. Make sure you've got a strong
spark. Our 78 would idle fine, but would sputter and die at higher rpms
(+2000 or so). I checked all the fuel supply, filter, FI stuff, timing,
idle: all fine. Still stalled at high rpms, though. Finally, we replaced
the coil, and had no more problems. Your problem might differ, but it
doesn't hurt to check the coil, and it's pretty easy, too.

Good luck!
