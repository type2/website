Subject: Re: [T2] trying to do my rear brakes and need help!

&gt; &gt; Volkswagens don't have lug nuts. They have lug bolts, or more
specifically
&gt; &gt; lug bolts that weld themselves to the brake drums.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Whoa, not true!  Vanagons have LUG NUTS on the front hubs and LUG BOLTS on
&gt; the rear hubs.
&gt; Yes, she has a 78 which has bolts at all 4 hubs but do not say
&quot;Volkswagens
&gt; don't have lug nuts&quot;.

Sorry about this, I am half asleep from playing with my 66 Deluxe all day.
Her 78 and my 77 have lug NUTS at all 4 wheels.
And I reversed the Vanagon bolts....they are on the front, nuts on the rear.
