Subject: Idle/Low RPM Issue - 77 FI

Well,  we took our Westy on vacation into northern PA last week.  It
ran pretty well all week until the drive home.  It will not idle.  As
soon as I let off the gas it promptly dies.  It still has plenty of
power once I get is rev'd up a bit.  I have checked all the hoses for
leaks, replaced the points and condenser and checked all the hoses
again.  No change.  I found a loose wire connection which I fixed but,
that didn't change anything.  Anyone want to take guesses at the cause
of the problem?  The person with the closest guess wins a lifetime
supply of used bandages.

Thanks in advance,
Ken
