Subject: AK!! My throttle stuck in FLOORED position. Update. 

Dear Volks,

It's been 24 hours since my bus's throttle stuck on and I'm back on the
road again. I never found the c-clip, but found one the third (and last!) place in town I could bike to. Yay for the good old fashioned hardware store! I 
bought four of them _at_ 10 cents each and got a very tired look from the old guy 
behind the counter when all I had was a $20 bill.

Turns out, some odd English size fits on the bus. i can't quite remember now.
I think it was 7/32 inch snap ring.

There were a few obvious potential causes:
1- The c-clip popped off, thus effectively disengaging my gas pedal from the
throttle. Maybe.

2- The nut holding all the moving parts on the throttle (springs, levers, egr 
linkage) was a little loose. Thus when throttle is on full, the lever didn't 
hit the stop cleanly, but would twist slightly and ride up on it. Although it
didn't do this while I played with it, it might have created enough friction to 
keep the throttle springs from pulling the butterfly closed again when released.
I tightened the nut (it's hard to tighten it too much since the throttle turns 
beneath the wrench if you make it very tight) and the whole throttle assembly
seemed to work more cleanly.

3-Maybe cleaning the sizeable pile of gunk from beneath my gas pedal allows it 
to go further down than before. If so, I might be able to pull the throttle 
further open than before. Bentley says to adjust the accelerator cable such
that the throttle lever stops 1-1.5mm shy of touching the stop when pedal is 
to the metal. I need to recruit an assistant to stomp on the gas pedal (my
lovely assistant/ copilot for life is working late this evening) while I lie 
in the back and see how far the throttle moves. It's evidently kind of a narrow
tolerance: Too tight and you might get sticky throttle, too loose and the 
kickdown switch on the auto tranny doesn't work. I'll keep you all posted.

Thanks for any and all response to my request for help!

Respectfully,
Surfer &quot;The engines are running away and I kinna do anything about it Cap'n&quot; Bob
