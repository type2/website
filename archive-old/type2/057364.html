Subject: Thanks to Karl von Salzen &amp; the List

Hello all,

Many thanks to the generous list members, and especially to Karl who
responded to one part of my posting regarding needing some westy
handles.  He has sent them, and though I haven't received them yet, I am
grateful.

(Also, my p-mail to him is being returned so I have no other way than
this to thank him.)

David Bogle

'72 Brooklyn 2.0L Campmobile
(possibly soon:  '87 Syncro Westy, thanks to some vanagon list members)
