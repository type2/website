Subject: Question

Am I imaging it or was there a post recently about someones turn signals that stopped cancelling and they
found a squiggely wire on the floor?  I told them that on mid 74 and up buses, the wire piece is held in with
2 white pieces. Then they posted back that they were searching for the 2 white pieces?

I need to get my meds checked :)
