(to the tune of Robert Preston in &quot;The Music Man&quot;)

Folk! Gather 'round! I said gather 'round...

What I have here is a VW, yes, I said a VW Bus. Just look at these great
features, and you'll get in line to grab one of these dandies with cash in
hand! No pushing, please!

Why, it's got:

More headroom than a DeTomaso Pantera!
More luggage space than a Ferrari Testarosa!
Better gas mileage than a Lamborghini Countache!
Cheaper insurance than a Jaguar Vanden Plaaaah!
More passenger room than a Corvette!
A better view of the traffic than a BMW Z8 (take THAT, Mr. Bond)!
Better brakes than a 1928 Rolls Royce Silver Thingy!
Better acceleration than my sisters Radio Flyer 90!
A longer name than any Porsche ever produced!

And it does all this with 6 cylinders LESS than a Dodge Viper!

Step right up....

&quot;Oh, we got VW's
Right here in (name your city).
With a capital &quot;V&quot;
that rhymes with &quot;B&quot;
which stands for &quot;BUS&quot; (which stands for Bus)...&quot;

WHERE'S MY PROZAC??!?!??
