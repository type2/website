Subject: Re: [T2] Distributors and total advance

Tom, I pmailed this to you last night, never heard back. Maybe you didn't get
it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I want you to do a couple of things [ok, more than a couple] and send me the
results:

What are the numbers stamped in the body of the dizzy?

Do you have a timing light with an advance dial or a degree wheel on the crank?

At idle, do you have vacuum at the inner port of the vacuum unit?

At idle, disconnect the inner port hose. What is your timing now?

Leave it off and plug the line. Run engine to 3500. Read timing. What is it?
Disconnect outer hose.
Read timing again at 3500. What is it?

Take off the dist cap. Look on the arm of the vacuum unit just before it
attaches to the breaker plate. There should be a 3 digit number. What is it?


&gt; Alrighty then.
&gt;
&gt; After reading all of the wonderful musings on distributors
&gt; and what their total advance should be for various engines,
&gt; I sat down and confirmed what I thought I remembered:
&gt;
&gt; at full advance (3500-3600 RPM), the engine is advanced to
&gt; 49 deg (+/- 1 deg) BTDC.  This is on a 1971 bus, 1600DP
&gt; with a rebuit dual vacuum advance dizzy.
&gt;
&gt; Doh!
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps this is why my engine has been running hotter than I'd
&gt; like?  I have my timing set to 5 deg ATDC at 850 rpm, with the
&gt; vacuum hoses hooked up and the engine warmed up...
&gt;
&gt; And I had thought that the dual vacuum advance just had more total
&gt; advance than the 009...
