Subject: Hydraulic Lifters?

Hey guys, just curious... I've been reading some of the messages and a lot
of people have told me that Hydraulic lifters.. or the hydraulic lifter
conversion on the 1.8 is a BAD idea. My motor that was rebuilt under 1000
miles ago had already come with the hydraulic lifter conversion when I
bought the Bus. Any ideas?


Thanks,
