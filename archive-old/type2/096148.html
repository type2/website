&gt; &gt;&gt; I can't seem to get the vacuum to go any higher.  Right now it's 15-16&quot; or
&gt; &gt; What is your timing at?  Should be 7.5 before at idle.
&gt; 
&gt; I redid the timing because I measured the dwell a couple of weeks later and
&gt; it went from 50 to 52.5.  When I timed it two days ago I set it to:
&gt; 
&gt; Idle: 880
&gt; Dwell: 47.8 at idle (46.7 at 2000 rpm)

well couple years ago I put in a Pertronix and the dwell is rock steady
with no change in two years, haven't touched the adjustment since I
installed and set it
