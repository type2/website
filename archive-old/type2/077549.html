&lt;&lt; On coating for rust prevention, I don't think so.  I wish it were, but I
can't think of a practical way.  Maybe injecting the cavity with waxoyl or
similar would help, but any drilling would weaken the beam, so the holes
would have to be small and carefully planned.  Actually I think that a
couple small holes at the bottom of the beam to promote drainage might
actually help substantially.  The present drain is dirt flat inadequate
and always has been. &gt;&gt;

The rep for Waxoyl met in Europe told me that the best way to apply their 
product is to spay it on under pressure.  Waxoyl offers it in the UK at can 
with a pump sprayer.  The rep said this isn't effective to get the product 
into all the small places and seams where it need to go.   He gave me this
