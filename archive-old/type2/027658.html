I really want to thank everybody for there replies and patience, it has been 
over 10 years since I last worked on VW's and 13years since I last worked on 
a type 2.  I just picked up a heck of a deal on a 78' westy weekender, 
($550) in awsome shape, just not running well.  Have never worked with VW 
Fuel Injection.

Now for my current problem.  I disconnet the air flow meter and it will fire 
but not run.  I hook the AFM back up and it will try to fire then flood out. 
  So the fuel cut off switch is working.  It has to be messing up before the 
AFM somewhere, any suggestions on what would make it flood still,
PS I unplugged the Cold start valve and no change!
Thanks,
Larry
78' westy
