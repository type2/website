Subject: Re: [T2] how works a thermostat??!! (on a 76 Type IV)

I can see why you are confused :-)
See below:

&gt; what i cant get is this...
&gt;
&gt; if the flap is closed when the piece that holds the
&gt; cable screw is pointed straight up towards the the top
&gt; of the engine bay. then how will an EXPANDING
&gt; thermostat PULL that arm down in order to open the
&gt; flap??? shouldnt it be shrinking??
&gt;

You are confused because it doesn't operate like you think it does.  When
that little tab is pointed straight up, the flaps are FULLY OPEN, not
closed.

The thermostat contracts when cold, pulling on the cable which pulls that
little tab down against spring tension to close the flaps (the spring is
wound around the rod near where the cable connects).  As the thermostat
warms, it expands and slackens the cable.  The slack is of course taken up
by the spring and the flaps open as the thermostat expands until they are
fully open with that little tab pointing straight up.


&gt; unless i have this whole thing wrong and the flap is
&gt; actually closed when that little screw piece is down
&gt; and pointing towards the front of the bus, in which
&gt; case an expanding thermostat would in fact serve to
&gt; open the flap by releasing tension on the screw piece.
&gt;

You answered your own question.  Just needed confirmation :-)
