Subject: Re: [T2] clutch scrape?

&gt; In many years of working on VW's, I have never had to have a flywheel
&gt; resurfaced.

Now that you mention it, my '71 had some clutch chatter for a while, and I
though I was going to need to resurface the flywheel... but now the problem
has gone away on its own.

Is there something inherent in the design that tends to keep the flywheel
surface flat?
