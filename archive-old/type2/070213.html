Subject: Re:'fridges and coolers... 

Hi all,

A couple of things about 'fridges and coolers.

My '78 bus has a dead 'fridg by Dometik. There is an inverter under the back
seat. It's not perfectly clear to me, but I think the inverter converts DC
from the battery to 120 volt AC to run the 'fridge. Some sparky out there want
to confirm that assertion please?

Maybe if I left it on for 8 hours it could get cold, but after 45 minutes the 
cooler unit inside the 'fridge wasn't even slightly cool. I suppose bangin on
it with a hammer per Ron Salmon couldn't hurt. I'm sure it's all in where and 
how hard you hit it ;-)

I'm not at all stoked about the proposition of spending several hundred bucks
to get a new 'fridge as inefficient as my old one. Sounds to me like the Vanagon
propane 'fridge is the way to go, but don't know if it's practical to put one in
a Westy.

I have seen Westies with some sort of fridge conversion installed. Never had the
opportunity to inspect closely, but there is a grill cut and mounted into the 
outer  wall, driver's side. Looking in the window, looked like the original
top open 'fridge next to the back seat was in effect. Anyone know about this 
one?

My old '79 had an icebox that was quite well insulated. I use my dead 'fridge as
an icebox and the ice lasts for several days. I'm inclined to remove all that 
heavy dead 'fridge stuff and make it an icebox. 

They now sell a solid state electric 'fridge the size of a big Playmate cooler 
for $90 at K-Mart. Plugs into 12V. Anyone tried one of these out? Maybe stick
the works from one of those in the VW box for a new kind of 'fridge? How much 
current do those things draw? Are they more efficient than those old Dometics?

Seems to me efficiency is key, since 4 hours of wimpy cooling before your 
battery poops out is unacceptably lame in my opinion.

Keep cool out there,
Surfer Bob
