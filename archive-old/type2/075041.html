Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities

Okay guys, the heck with it. This is what you do:

Step 1: Get a roof rack. Westies and Rivieras already have one. Build a
fairing on your roof rack to keep snow and rain off.

Step 2: Purchase a Honda EU2000i generator and secure it to the roof rack.
It weighs 43 pounds and burns a quart of gas every hour. Run a power cable
from the generator to the inside of your Bus.

Step 3: Buy any 1500-watt space heater and plug it in.

It's quiet, it will last a long time, it's cheap to run if not to buy, and
when winter's over you'll be able to run your refrigerator, desktop
computer, window air conditioner or whatever you want from it.
