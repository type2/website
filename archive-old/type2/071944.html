&gt;The thread on warm air for the type IV carbs has triggered these

&gt;
&gt;Why preheat the carb air?  Does it make a difference in a FI system?
&gt;
&gt;I realize that colder air is denser than hot air (except for the hot air
&gt;from politicians) and I'm figuring that there is more energy potential
&gt;available in cold air.  I also have noticed that in a few racing
&gt;equipment catalogs, that there are devices to cool the air.
&gt;
&gt;Would anybody care to explain the physics/mechanics behind all this?

I don't know for sure but my guess is to prevent icing in the carbs.  I
don't see any benefit for fuel injected engines, except possibly to heat
the engine up faster?  That seems a bit farfetched.
