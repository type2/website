Subject: Re: [T2] 911 engine install on a 74 bus.

How about an all alluminum v8?
google baja busses
A land rover engine in a bus? Oh yeah!

&gt;Chris,
&gt;
&gt;I'm not going to poop on your idea. I think a 911 powered bay bus would be
&gt;awesome. Dream on, I've dreamed of it as well. It is the only conversion
&gt;into a bay bus worth considering, IMO.
