Subject: Re: Oil Burner/Front Windshield replacement

Derek,
if it is blowing blue smoke out of the exhaust and it
has good compression i would imagine your rings are
going and not your valves.   you can do a compression
check, take down thge readings, then put oil in the
spark plug hole and recheck.   if your valves are
going usually you will have very low compression in
that cylinder.   as far as the windshield, you can do
it yourself, check the archives for some tricks of the
trade, but i had never installed any auto glass and i
replaced mine pretty easily.   one good trick i found
is to change it on a nice warm day in full sunlight.  
My window rubber was nice and pliable and the
windshield just slipped right in.

&gt; The engine is a little bit less then perfect.  Its
&gt; burning oil (blue
&gt; smoke), but the compression is good.  This would
&gt; suggest that valves
&gt; are not sealing properly.  To repair then, one would
&gt; need to remove
&gt; the head and send in for rebuild.  Is this
&gt; assumption reasonable?
&gt; Should I be able to remove the head myself?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the front windshield is cracked and will
&gt; require replacement.
&gt; Is this a do-it-yourselfer's job?
