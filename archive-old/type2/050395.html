&gt; Question #1:
&gt; 
&gt; I went to my FLAPS and I was flabbergasted when they told me, &quot;We don't 
&gt; carry a battery for a 76 Transporter, nor do I even have a listing for it.&quot;
&gt; Hmmm, so, to those of you out there with a 76 Westy (or otherwise), what 
&gt; kind of battery do you individuals recommend?

A group 24 battery fits nicely and is very common.

&gt; Question #2:
&gt; Has anyone ever tried to rig a second battery to operate say...radio, 
&gt; lights and other such things.  I was thinking of what to do while camping 
&gt; without city power.  I want to be able to run some interior lights, a 
&gt; stereo and a cigarette lighter (for a computer...I know, I know....) from 
&gt; auxiliary power, so as not to drain the main battery.  Also, how would this 
&gt; battery be connected so that it could be charged while driving?  Could I 
&gt; install some sort of switch...you know...park, turn of the bus, flip the 
&gt; switch...aux. power!

No, nobody's ever tried that!  :)

This was the stock setup on some westys.  A cutout relay split the two
batteries when the engine was off an connnected them for chargeing.
