Subject: 1977 bus for sale - Cocoa Beach, FL

Talking to my father today, he passed along the following info from a van
he saw parked in Cocoa Beach.  I will be flying down to visit the folks on
the 7th of January and could visit this van as well if anyone is
interested.

1977 VW van with pop-top (no idea if it's a westy or what)
82099 miles on odometer
asking $4500 OBO

phone (321) 799-3334 for additional info.

That's all I know, there ain't no more.
