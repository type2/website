Subject: Evaporative engine cooling

This question strictly concerns the arid southwest and other parts of the 
world where the air temperature rises over 100F and the relative humidity 
is well below 50%.
 
If you put a misting system in the air intakes for the engine 
compartment, that should result in the equivalent of a 20F drop in 
ambient temperature from the perspective of the engine's cooling system. 
And that might just be enough to keep the driver's blood pressure at 
reasonable levels while driving through the desert and monitoring the oil 
temps.
 
The trick is to optimize the system. There would be a water tank 
(installed under the floor), a water pump, connecting hoses, and the 
misting loops inside the intakes. To keep water consumption at a 
manageable level, though, it would be necessary to optimize the mist by 
controlling the output. One way to do that would be to have an 
intermitant switch to the pump. Another would be to emulate the FI 
system by running the pump constantly and installing an &quot;injector&quot; that 
would pulse at some determined rate. And finally, one could simply 
optimize the &quot;jets&quot; that put out the mist, while running the system 
constantly.
 
 Any ideas?
