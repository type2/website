Subject: Vanagon going Megasquirt

Hi, just to let the list know I'll being moving to the dark side and 
going with the Megasquirt II (fuel and spark) system over the winter. 
I'd appreciate any other listee's advice in making the transition.  I'll 
try and do a good job of documenting the highlights.  The reason I am 
switching is the existing wiring harness is old, brittle and unreliable, 
my ECU is flaky, and I'd like to upgrade to something new, reliable, and 
learn something while I am at it. 

Since this could turn a bit off-topic, consider emailing me off the 
list. Thanks.
