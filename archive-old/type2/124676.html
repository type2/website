Subject: re painting with Yacht Enamel

I've read numerous posts from people who've painted their poptops with Dulux
White Yacht Enamel, and it came out so smooth, shiny, perfect.
Has anyone ever rollered it on to a bus, and if so, how did it come out?
It is is self levelling and smoothing, tempting...Will it work with steel,
over old paint, etc??
