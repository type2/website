&gt; You know those stupid exhaust flanges that keep on coming loose? Yeah,
&gt; those. The ones that are a bear to get to due to the rear engine mount. They
&gt; can cause backfiring. Check and tighten.

ive considered wrApping the joint in muffler tape and tightening the clamp
on that. I dont know if it would hold up any better.
