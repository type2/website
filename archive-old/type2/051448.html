Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leak

Would that cause all of the oil to leak out of the engine?

Darrin

&gt; I had this problem and there are 2 places right there that could cause it,
&gt; mine leaked from both.  First is the dipstick tube, it goes through a
little
&gt; rubber accordian looking piece, that fails regularly.  The other is the
oil
&gt; filler tube itself.  Mine was cracked and needed to be brazed.  Niether is
a
&gt; big deal and can be fixed without pulling the motor.
