Subject: Big pistons little engine part3

Thanks so much to all of you for your valuable advise. One way or the
other, you all gave me encouragement when I needed it the most. I think
I have a plan now!

You are all correct in the fact that 2000 pistons won't work on 1800
rods. Why didn't I notice the difference in the wrist pin location and
interference with the knob on top of the little end of the 1800 rods.
Did some eyeballing last night, NO WAY will 2000 pistons go on those
1800 rods!

From what most of you had to say I think I will put the new 2000cc
pistons on the 2000 crank and rods in the best of the 2 cases only after
I measure for tolerances. The cam from the 1800 looks new. (The 3 good
cylinders on the 1800 have no detectable ridge at the top possibly
indicating low miles since last rebuild?)

This brings up the next question. Im thinking about putting the 1800 cam
in the 2000 case. From what I have read it sounds like cams are
interchangeable from 72 to 77. If this cam doesn't run out or measure
too worn I'll use it. When I pulled the lifters out of the 1800 2 of
them didn't look right. The little cup the push-rod seats into fell out
of the lifter. The others seem like a tight press fit meant to never
come apart. All show no wear or scoring on the flat end. When I tore
down the 2000 I found the cam was wasted. Looks like a cheap imitation
non hardened &quot;Peanut Butter&quot; Cam. The hydraulic lifters look great but
the cam shows wear patterns of were the lifters would ride on them that
are quite deep. What about using these hydraulic lifters on the 1800
cam? I've read some squabbles over doing this, but I have also read of
some doing this with good results. Is there really any difference in the
metal between a good solid lifter cam and an equally good hydro cam? I
realize the lift and duration of the 1800 cam is slightly more than the
2000 cam, but more power is not what I'm after. I want to use what I
have if it will work and keep costs down.

Once again thanks for enduring my wordy rantings and having the patients
to reply with such helpful advice.

Tom

Maybe the turtlebus will move down the road again after all! :)
