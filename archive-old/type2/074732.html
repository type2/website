Tom,
    You might wanna check out some of the older gas stations in your area and 
see if they have a spin balancer.  The kind that balance the tire still on 
the car, or in this case, Bus.  I myself am looking for an old bubble 
balancer.  I had to make an adapter for wide fives for my tire machine,  
seems I can make one for the balancer.  I'm leaning toward an old wheel 
adapter.
                                                                      Peace,
