Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injectors &amp; Intake Runners

On 3/30/03 9:44 AM, &quot;TR Gesell&quot; &lt;trgesell_at_compuserve_dot_com&gt; wrote:

&gt; When replacing fuel injector seals and intake runner gaskets, is it a good
&gt; idea (or a bad idea) to give them a light coat of oil?  Or just install them
&gt; dry? Also does anyone care to estimate the right torque for the four intake
&gt; runner/head nuts?

Dry. The little seals will deform and seal. The large ones are just for
support/vibration etc.

Bentley says 14 ft. lbs. Use a pattern so they tighten up evenly and you
don't have a leak.
