X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

The Corvair Van is basicly a VW van build by Chevy. Rear mounted aircooled
engine, swingaxle trans, driver infront of the front wheels. But these
things are UGLY. They even made a few(very few) Corvair pickups, just like
the single cab VW. However they started these things around 1960.

Chrysler was a latecomer to the [North American] rip-off game.  Check out a
Corvair van.

There were other European &quot;mini-vans&quot;, but few made it across the pond...

&gt;&gt;  Me too.  I always say Chrysler ripped off VW on the concept.  &lt;&lt;
