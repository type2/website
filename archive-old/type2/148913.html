Subject: asbestos cuffs

Does anyone know where to buy these at?  I am not wanting the the asbestos
cuffs, but the rubber replacements for them listed in Ratwell's.  

I am going to a VW wrecking yard today to get a few things, and wondering
about the asbestos cuffs replacements.  I have surfed busdepot and cip1_dot_com
&lt;http://cat.cip1_dot_com&gt;  to no avail.
 
http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Heating.html  in section 5.
 
My engine is out and I need to get it back in before the first camping trip
of the year in Oregon in Feb.
 
FYI: This is for a 1978 Rivera 2.L FI Engine.
Photos are on link below if you want to look at it.
