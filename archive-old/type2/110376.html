My grandfather (a coal miner in PA), died of what was then
called, &quot;miner's asthma&quot;...The trades all had their own spec-
cial names for occupational diseases; painter's got lead
poisoning from the paint and paint dust...The &quot;mad hatter&quot;
in Alice in Wonderland went mad from mercury poisoning...
Women (smaller hands) developed cancer of the mouth from
sharpening their brushes by licking them when painting the
numbers on watch dials with radium paint...
