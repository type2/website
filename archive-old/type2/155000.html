Don't know how much difference the sizes make.  In the gear  
calculation chart I mentioned previously,
entering 185/75/14 (Iknow its not 185R/14 but the calculator won't  
let me enter that size in) against
195/75/14 for my gear ratiio set (2 litre) made a difference of 0.7  
kph difference at 1000 rpm or at my
normal hwy rpms of about 3400 a difference of 2.4 kph or  
approximately 80 rpm if running at the
same speed.

Not sure if that equates from 185R to 195R or not but would suspect  
that the difference
would only be minor.

That was the reason i went looking for such a calculator to see if  
putting 195R on the rear would
make any substantial difference.

Have you noticed any real world difference between the two sizes??
