one on 2.0L?  What benefit/drawback?  Who has them?  I have seen them at
BusBoys, but their website always locks up my computer with the damn 3

K&amp;N filters stop bugs and birds from entering your engine, but not much
smaller.  They are popular with racers since they will not clog up and
stop the engine from running, which enables the racer to finish the race
(if you don't finish, you don't get any money, in most cases)  Filtration
is secondary, since racers rebuild engines often in any case.

It's tough to beat the stock VW filters, either oil bath or paper.  They
are designed for long-term longevity.
