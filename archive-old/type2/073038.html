&gt;What is the big difference between the 2 and how long will each
&gt;last?...approx...

Mr. George Lyle sez:

&gt;There is absolutely no reason, even monitary, that should induce you
&gt;to put yourself through the torture that a Brazilian muffler will
&gt;give.

I agree with every word, this is a very foolish way to save $20-30. At
around $53 my Leibstritz, or however you say it, is still solid as a rock
after two years. I welded the tailpipe to it and didn't blow holes in the
muffler, and given my welding skills that's saying a lot about the quality
of the metal.

In Wisconsin I promise you'll be replacing a Brazilian after one single winter.
