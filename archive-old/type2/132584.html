Subject: Richard Atwell's website

If you haven't visited Richard Atwell's website, or haven't done so for 
a while, be sure to do so and bookmark it. Richard's is the Oxford 
English Dictionary, the Smithsonian Institution, the Harrah's of bus 
websites. If we had to pay for it, we couldn't afford it.

I think there may have to be, at some point, an official Richard Atwell 
day.
