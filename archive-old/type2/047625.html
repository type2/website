&gt; Well, the Cat on my bus emits CO at 0.00% and HC at 36ppm. I accept this 
&gt; isn't very realistic as the test station recorded the engine temp at 17C 
&gt; (63F). I would have much preferred a real test with the engine warm then the 
&gt; recorded HC should have been lower.

I think that they simply forgot to start the engine for the test.  No run
= no emissions!
