&gt; I have a 72 bus and the power all works in it put when I turn the key the
&gt; final turn to start it nothing happens.  I think its an electrical problem.
&gt; It's a fairly new starter (6 months old) so I don't think its that.  Is there
&gt; a main wire that I should check? Or anthing else that could be doing this?

Yeah. If you crawl under your Bus, on the back of the transmission you will
see a device which looks like two cans hooked side by side. This is the
starter. The small can is the solenoid, and there are three wires coming out
of it, two heavy and one real thin. One of the heavy wires is about an inch
long and goes into the starter; the other runs up into the engine bay where
it connects straight to the battery. The thin wire goes to the keyswitch.

Get yourself a hunk of heavy wire--12 gauge is enough for this test--and
take the bus out of gear and set the parking brake, then chock the wheels
and put the key in your pocket. Get back under and jumper the two bolts
holding the heavy wires to the solenoid. Assuming you have a good battery,
the starter should begin to run. If it does, the starter's good. Now jumper
the wire to the battery to the wire to the keyswitch. If your luck holds,
the engine will start to crank. All ya gotta hear is one &quot;rrr-rrr&quot; to know
it works.

Assuming the starter works, you have one of three problems: no power to the
front of the bus, a bad wire running to the starter, or a bad switch.

Dangerous operation ahead: put the key in the bus and turn it on, then crawl
back under and jump the battery wire to the keyswitch wire. Does the bus
start? You have power. Less dangerous operation: turn the bus on, then do a
voltage check on the hot side of the coil. If there's voltage there, the
power's getting to the front of the bus.

Now take your keyswitch out and, using your Bentley manual, determine which
prong controls the starter. Also find the hot lead. Make a short jumper and
connect these two prongs IN THE PLUG!, and listen for cranking. If you get
it, either the switch or the plug is bad. No cranking? Probably the wire
running to the starter solenoid.
