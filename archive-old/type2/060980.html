Subject: tachometer recalibration?

My VDO tach (nein, nicht Tachometer, sondern Drehzahlmesser :) is
calibrated for a 4-cylinder engine. Is there a cheap way to get it to work
with 6 cylinders? For example, is there a chip I can place between the
ignition coil and the tach that will &quot;cancel&quot; every third pulse?

Btw, I looked and did not see any type of switch or DIP switch in the back
of the unit. I guess it may only exist on more expensive models.
