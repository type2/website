I realise it is no longer friday but I can't resist
You are coprrect in stating that Hemp is not technocally the same as
Marijuana but the Hemp is definately not legal to grow in the US.  In fact
millions of dollars a year are spent by the gov't to eradicate wild hemp
that still grows in the US.  Recently some states have beeen fighting to
legalise Hemp again, as it is recently been recognized as a valuable crop
again.

Sorry list if not pertainant but couldn't resist.  Anyone out there use
hemp to make there curtains.  I am searching for material to do this?

&gt;what you would like with hemp since hemp is legally grown in this
&gt;country. hemp is legally grown in all countries &amp; marijuana is legal in
&gt;all the countries in the world except i think 7. people are getting wise
&gt;that its much safer method of mind altering than alcohol. consider the
&gt;simpistic facts that if you drink too much you will die. if you take too
&gt;much aspirin you will die, no amount of herb can kill you. even caffeine
&gt;can kill. now which would you choose? jah holy herb! i recommend a westy
