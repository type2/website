Subject: Re: [T2] Crashed my bus!

&lt;&lt;My 71 Westfakia bus has a caved in front end but is still drive able
as long as I don't need lights.&gt;&gt;

Run Silent, Run Deep, in the Westfakia at night.
It'll be a secret mission.
 
&lt;&lt;Some kid started an un safe left turn right in front of me and then
stopped. No one was hurt but my bus may never be the same again.&gt;&gt;

Aww---
A little cavin' a pavin' on that nose and a couple of spray cans she'll
be as good as new.

&lt;&lt; The bitter irony is I just got my 65' International Harvester truck
running today&gt;&gt;

Here ya go--&quot;stylin' &quot; in the Cornbinder while ya get the Bus all dialed
in---


Did you have words with the Ute after the crash??

Hoope ya didn't get a ticket for following to close to preventan
accident-----

Oops--

Adios,
