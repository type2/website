Subject: Re: [T2] Parts list for a '74??

That is really difficult and I have that problem myself oftentimes.

I have a 1972 VW parts manual (in german, the light blue ones) that 
includes the 72 modellyear, so incl. the pancake engine.
I have never seen a later version of that parts cataloge.
I think they must have introduced the microfiche system that year.
Unfortunately the microfiche were updated every 3 month and everytime a 
new edition came out the old one was to be destroyed.
In the 80ies the ETKA came out (a little later in the US I think) and 
updates no longer even left a trace of the superceeded part numbers. It 
has become useless.

So the objective must be to find a microfiche of approx. your vintage. 
Very difficult in my experience.
Even if you find one, that will not help you always because so much was 
changed since then.
I think that the 73 and 74 modellyears are the hardest to document 
because they changed so much and they included so many technical 
features that did not really age well.
I have NEVER seen a 73 -74 modell with all the correct engine setup 
(that was Alabama though). It may be impossible to find or restore that 
EGR/smogpump stuff (exact years elude me now).

It is noticeable to me that the printed technical service bulletins in 
my collection also stop in 73/74.

If anyone can find a reliable way to put fiches on the net or on CD I 
could contribute the following information (parts fiches only):

Typ 2 edition 1-1990   in german    000.7350.05.00
Type 2 edition 1-1990 in english      000.7350.05.21
Typ 2 edition 1-1995 in german    000.7350.29.00
Type 2 edition 1-1995 in english    000.7500.29.21
Campmobile 74-79  000.7360.06.80
Type 2 up to -67 edition english 1-1978  735.002.20

&gt;Does anyone know of a COMPLETE part number list for a '74 -- 7 passenger?
&gt;Something in electronic form would be nice so I could flatfile it in Excel
&gt;for sorting and searching.
