ola loafers,

just thought i'd ask for you folks' opinions on what one should take on a
road trip with ones bus ?  i don't mean the crib board, lawn chairs and the
handwoven toque, i mean mechanical stuff for the bus.  tools and beverages
and spare parts that one's bus might need for an extended drive.  thanks
very much for the time.  later days !!
