Subject: Re: [VB] x-mas special: seats for sale cheap in NC

I also have bench seats out of some bay buses.  A full width rear tan seat out
of an early bay, and a full width rear black seat out of a late bay, and a 2/3
black middle seat out of a late bay...and some nice late bay bumpers.  Get em
outta here!
I don't think I'm interfering with Chris's deal as these are in WI and his are
in NC ;)

Come pick em up!
