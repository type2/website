Subject: carb rebuild

Hello

I have rebuilt many carbs. It is easy if you are  very careful and
make notes and draw pictures of the linkage and of the position of
springs and jets and balls and choke position etc. there are lots
of incorrect interchangeable parts combinations; some springs can
go back on the wrong side of parts. etc.

I can rebuild any VW carb now without having to draw pictures, but
I still take notes about where each different sized jet goes. Some
of the jets look the same and will screw back into the wrong hole.
Their outside threads are the same, but their inside jet holes are
very different. You can ruin your engine by screwing up the jets.
You can make the engine run too lean and too hot and burn up the
valves. So take notes.

other hints:

keep all the parts in a deep walled tray. don't let the parts roll
of your workbench.

use lots of different sized straight screwdrivers and use the
correct size on the jets to avoid ruining the slots in the heads
of the jets. You might need to grind off the edges of a
screwdriver to beable to reach into a deep hole. if you gouge out
a chunk of brass, you can block off a critically sized channel

don't bother to take the throttle or choke plate off the shafts.
don't take off any screws that have been &quot;staked&quot; in place

buy a gallon, or better 5 gallon, bucket of carb cleaner to soak
the parts

make sure there are no plastic parts on any part that you are
going to soak. be especially careful to notice plastic bushings on
shafts. Sometimes it is not worth taking some assembly all the way
apart to soak it in the bucket of carb cleaner

use air to blow out the parts, but wear goggles to protect your
eyes

if you don't have an air source, use the tiny stray on an aerosol
can to blow out all the holes

use old tooth brushes to help scrub the parts before and after the
carb cleaner soak

on large surfaces, gently tighten the circumferential screws or
bolts, across from each other and in a staggered pattern, go
through this pattern over and over, a little tighter each time,
until you reach final torque. If you tighten one screw too tight,
you can warp the parts and you will have a gas leak

gently try to pull out the brass fuel intake tubes and the brass
vacuum tubes. try to wiggle these tubes. if you can wiggle the
tubes they are too loose. gently tap them back into the carb and
then get a tiny sharp center punch and stake around the edges of
the tube's hole to tighten the tubes in the carb.

I have found that the accelerator pump tube is usually always
loose. be sure to aim this tube down the side of the venturi so
that the spray does not hit the choke plate

don't throw away any gaskets or any parts and compare the new
gaskets and parts to the old parts. the old parts were working,
the new gaskets may look ALMOST EXACTLY the same, but the new
gasket has to be ABSOLUTELY EXACTLY the same. the new gasket has
to have all the holes the old gasket had. carbs have very
complicated gasoline and air passages. you cannot block off  any
one of these passages.

use the gauge that comes in the carburetor kit to adjust all the
dimensions that the directions say to adjust. do not just put in
new parts and expect the adjustments to be the same or to be
correct.
