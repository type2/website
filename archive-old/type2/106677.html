Subject: Carburation options

Hi , my name is Duncan, and I have been a member on and off, mostly off the
last few years. I have just purchased 1.7L AIS camper. It comes with the
Weber progressive single. I have had one of these in the past, and I am
looking into my options as far as replacing it. Having looked through the
archives it seems that my options are:
 
Leave it (my mechanic says that its an extra $200 to get it through Oregon
emissions)
Weber dual carbs (~450$-600)
miller FI (850$) gasp
 
the two options I couldn't find much on were 
1) finding a pair of 72-4 solex's and having them rebuilt. Is this getting
impossible to do? In 1998 I found a set of good used carbs for 100$.
2)Finding a wrecked bus with stock FI and having it installed. My bus has 0
FI parts left. Is this an option, and if so how expensive an option is it.?
 
It seems that there has been a lot of discussion on this topic in the past,
so instead of starting a thread I welcome your personal emails on the
topic. Also if there is an option I don't know about please email me.  The
bus runs OK as is, but I don't find the Weber a pleasant drive (YMMV, I'm
just stating my preference) I really liked  the acceleration and fuel
efficiency of the solex's I have had on my 72 and 74 busses.
 
thanks in advance
 
Duncan
