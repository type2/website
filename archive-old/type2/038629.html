Subject: no power at injectors on 2.0

hi all,
        i spent the day helping my buddy get his 77 camper ready to hit the 
road for a big road trip.  here is our &quot;show stopper&quot;  no power at the 
injectors!  we are getting gas up to the injectors but no power, hence no 
spray!  when we disconnected the plugs at the injectors and put a meter on 
the plug... nothing.  tried this both ways with the key on and while cranking 
the engine over with the starter. nothing.  we are getting 12 volts up to the 
series resistance block from terminal 88b of the double relay when the 
ignition is on.  we have continuity at the resistance block plug through each 
individual resistor.  all very equal.
about this point we ran out of light.  does any of this make sense to anyone 
or has anyone been down this same path before, and could give me the next 
possible step?

this bus was running fine six months ago when he shut the key off.  the bus 
is a 77 camper with a 2.0 hyd engine.
thanks everyone ;)
