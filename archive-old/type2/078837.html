 For Sale: '79 VW Bus Engine (Long Block) &amp; German Engine Rebuild Kit

* Type IV pancake engine
* hydraulic lifters
* fuel injected
* 2.0 liter

133k miles on engine from a one-owner bus when replaced with a rebuilt =
engine five years ago. Still ran fine, but needed new hydraulic cam =
followers (lifters). Old lifters were beginning to clack a bit.

Original '79 engine long block has been sitting on a pallet, covered by =
a tarp ever since.

I have an engine rebuild kit for this long block, which includes:

* set of 8 new Febi/Bilstein (German) hydraulic cam followers (lifters) =
022 109 309 - $79.95 new
* new set of Kolbenschmidt (German) main bearings (stock size) 021 198 =
481 A - $54.95 new
* new set of Federal Mogul (German) rod bearings (stock size) 039 105 =
701 - $39.95 new
* set of 4 new Osvat (Italian) exhaust valves 022 109 612 D - $39.95 new
* set of 8 new German bronze valve guides 021 101 417 - $23.95 new
* new set of Cofap (Brazilian) piston rings 029 198 175 BR - $19.95 new
* new crankshaft front &amp; rear oil seals &amp; O-ring - $12.95 new
* new Sachs (Canadian) clutch disc 029 141 031 BFS - $59.95 new
* new Sachs (Canadian) pressure plate assembly 029 141 025 B - $59.95 =
new
* new Sachs (Canadian) throwout bearing 113 141 165 B - $19.95 new
* new (USA) oil pump 021 115 107 AK - $79.95 new
* set of 8 new bronzed push rod tubes - $31.95 new
* set of 8 new valve adjustment screws (German) 022 109 451 - $8 new
* complete Dichtungen (German) engine gasket kit 021 198 009 C - $59.95 =
new

The engine rebuild kit, plus clutch disc and pressure plate assembly =
cost about $520 new. It is missing the camshaft bearings, which cost =
about $12.95.

I'm willing to sell the rebuild kit and the long block core together or =
separately. I'm asking US $295 for the engine and US $395 for the =
rebuild kit, plus shipping.
