  Injection?

We rebuild a lot of 2.0 FI engines (pull rebuild, install turn key)

FI major replacements and inspection repair. That most don't know or do.

FI injector locator seals/ bushings. There are two inner and outers.
Air intake sleeves. These go from the runners to the plenum.
Inspect the wiring harness. No need to remove the sheathing just check all 
the connections for splits. Make sure the wires are good and re-sheath if 
necc, not electrical tape. One nice thing to do is to paint the harness with 
vinyl paint, we use SEM plastic coat, looks sweet. Do this for the rubber 
hoses and stuff too. You can get close to OE colors too. Cleaning with 
solvent is OK. If you clean and paint you will be more apt to find problems. 
(this idea has kept us in business with few returns on used parts)
You can get new connectors for the injectors ext.
Also check the S boot for cracks, use a 3M plastic repair epoxy for this 
repair.
Checking the FI for problems is easy with a Bentley manual but no need to 
kill yourself, no symptoms? no need to test. If you have a problem then 
tackle it. If there is a problem it will be obvious.
Remember one thing if any, air! Cooling and intake. Cross all T's and dot 
all i's. This will give you 100K.
Oh timing is good too.

Call or email if you have any questions.

Subject: [T2] Converting from Weber single carb BACK to Fuel Injection?


&gt; Hi everyone-
&gt;
&gt; On my 1979 Deluxe Westy with 2.0 motor (less than 300 miles on COMPLETE 
&gt; rebuild) I cannot seem to get the Weber/Holley 2 bbl. progressive carb to 
&gt; dial in right.  The vehicle stumbles and misses slightly in 2 3 and 4th 
&gt; under acceleration.  I have tried both a new &quot;009&quot; distributor and what 
&gt; came on the bus &quot;021 905 205 S&quot; with new points, and neither makes any 
&gt; difference (with the &quot;009&quot; having a little less stumble).
