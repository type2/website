Subject: Re: i love carbs!

Actually, this is exactly the thing I wanted to bring up. I rebuilt my carb
last night and found the flared end (nipple) of the electromagnetic cutoff
valve has been snipped off by someone before me. What does this thing do?
What would be caused by it not being fully functional and will it mess up my
project of setting idle/mix, rpm and timing this weekend if i do not yet
have a replacement?
