Subject: Re: [T2] greasing rear wheel bearings in place

I designed a rear wheel bearing packing tool and I have promised to make
more of them, but have been unable to find the time so far.  I'm really
sorry. 

The problem with just putting a grease zerk in the axle housing is when you
add grease, you really don't remove the old nasty, rusty stuff.  With the
packing tool, the old grease is pushed out one side and the new grease
replacing it.  

Those rear wheel bearings take a rear beating and need fresh grease all the
way through them.  Those people who have had to replace those bearings and
it's usually on a trip somewhere near nowhere will tell you it is MUCH
better to grease ahead than replace by the side of the road.

 
&gt; I know there is, or was, someone on this list who had devised a way to
&gt; grease rear wheel bearings that were still installed.  I can't
&gt; remember who it was or the details of what he did.  Does anyone else
&gt; know?
