Subject: side tent question

Hi,
I purchased a side tent for my Westy online.  When the tent arrived and I 
attempted to set it up, I realized that I was not given all of the poles.  
My many attempts to contact the seller have been unsuccessful.  The tent is 
golden yellow in color with red, white, and blue stripes on the 
window/doors.  This tent does not have a floor.  I was told by someone on 
the vanagon list that it seems I have purchased a 70's Westy tent and that 
the Campmobile would give a diagram of how it is to be set up.

I am inquiring to find out if anyone happens to have a Campmobile manual 
that they would be willing to sell me or know of where I could obtain one?  
Does anyone know how I could go about purchasing replacement poles for my 
tent?
Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Jenny Loerzel
Chicago, IL
