Subject: Gene Berg Memorial Cruise

Hello all,
   First of all thanks again to all of you that helped re: Bentley and
answers about my engine seal. Got the manual (love it) and installed the
foam seal...not that hard but took awhile :)

   Now I'm wondering if any one from the list will be joining or going
to see the Gene Berg Cruise when it reaches Portland Or ? If you are and 
would like to get together when they arrive...please e-mail me
personally and I'll look for you there.

Thanks,
Pete
