Subject: Re: Starter removal for a 77 bus

Brett Cardon sends:

&gt; I am looking for a bit of advise for the removal of a starter on my 77 bus.
&gt; I only have one bolt left to remove, it is the top bolt and I cant seem to
&gt; locate it. Chilton's states &quot; have a helper hold the nut on the top bolt
&gt; with a wrench in the engine compartment while you remove the bolt from
&gt; underneath the vehicle.&quot; I cant seem to find the nut in the engine
&gt; compartment, and the bolt that I feel on the starter feels round....
&gt; 
&gt; Any helpful hints on how to get this top bolt and nut off would be grand.

That top bolt *is* round on the starter side. And it's flat on one side,
which keeps it from turning round and round. (The flat side is against the
starter.) 

That advice in Chilton's is good for a Type 1 engine, but the one you have
requires removing the piece of tin under the gas tank wall, which will
reveal the nut you need to turn. I like to hold the threads with a
screwdriver so the bolt won't go back into its hole.
