Subject: VDO gauges, senders, etc. for sale

Volks,

I have her some VDO equipment for sale.  I am selling it on behalf of our 
fellow listmember Jackson Burgess, who is by now probably on his way down 
into Baja California with his '79 Adventurewagen for some leisurely R&amp;R (I 
want his life).

This stuff was all purchased by Jackson from the Bus Depot (with 5% 
listmember discount) but for a host of reasons he decided not to install it 
and he would like to offer it to the list for a 15% discount.  I believe 
the guages are the Vision style.  All of it is BRAND NEW in the box.

Here is what I have:

Also:

When it is all sold I will be sending the money so he can buy more fish 
tacos.  Prices do not include shipping, but I will ship USPS for actual cost.
