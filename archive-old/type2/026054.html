Subject: Re: [T2] 1975 westy wiring

If you are running one of the dual senders, that is the problem, they come
on at higher pressres for the idiot light.  If you want to see if that is
the case, try screwing a standard VW sender into your riser where your
current sender is.  Or if you want to be even more convinced, screw an
inexpensive pressure gauge that you can pick up at the parts store on top of
your riser, that way you can read it direct.  Manual rev your engine and
read the pressures.  The pressre gauge is a good tool for the tool box, you
can quickly check used engines for oil pressure.

&gt; Also...my new oil pressure sender appears to be
&gt; working, and here's the other question.  When I'm at a
&gt; stoplight at idle (automatic,) my oil pressure idiot
&gt; light comes on.  Now, i have to run a lead wire for
&gt; the dash gauge...so I don't know what pressure I'm
&gt; usually running at.  Is this normal?  Or is it just a
&gt; matter of pouring some extra oil down in the extension
&gt; hose that I used?  Is the oil having issues getting to
&gt; the sender due to the extension?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again volks!
