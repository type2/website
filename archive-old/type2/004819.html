Well this isn't really a tool but it is the deal!

Coleman battery (8 d-cells) powered lantern. I fits in the engine
compartment perfectly and illuminates the area well. Also great for working
under the bus or under the dash because you can just lay it on its side and
let it light up the entire area.
