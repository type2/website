Hello Guys  What I use to lube the sliding doors is the Wurth HHS2000   
sprays as a liquid then turns into a grease last a long time and stays where you 
spray it We use it for throttle and clutch cables, even use it on my shop doors 
and lift cables  later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import Service  Salem
