Subject: interior trivia questions

1)  What is suppose to be attached between the rear view mirrow and the
visors on a 71?  Hint:  half-dime sized hole on each side of mirror.

2)  What is suppose to be attached on the wall between the back side and
side window?  Right up there above the left side of the table.
3)  Under the jump seat cushion there are 4 snaps.  What do they snap with?


PS  Long road trip this weekend.  I didn't have trouble the entire way!!
Very happy.
