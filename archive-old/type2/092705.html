Subject: Re: [T2] Splitting cases; WHY didn't someone mention this??? :-(

Pull the piston circlips and tap the wrist pins out.

You'll have to support the other side with a block of wood or put the 
piston near something that won't move like anothing upright that you clamp 
to the edge of your work bench.

You can use a 3/8&quot; socket extension to hammer on.

Don't hammer - just tap.

Good luck.


&gt;Now for my dilemma. The cases are apart about 2.5&quot; and will not go back
&gt;together because one has &quot;fallen&quot; a few degrees out of rotation. Nor can I
&gt;find what is causing it to stay that way. I was able to twist the camshaft
&gt;out and drop the crankshaft *nearly* into its position in one case half.
&gt;However, the other case half will not rotate so that I can rejoin the cases
&gt;to get to the piston circlips. Note, the pistons are up inside the bores, so
&gt;the circlips are not reachable. Since I can't get the case back into
&gt;alignment, I can't withdraw the pistons... the whole rotating assembly is
&gt;locked except for maybe 5 degrees of rotation. Further, I can get only 3 of
&gt;the rod nuts off, so I can't remove the rods.
