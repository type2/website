&gt; One more thing, and it is bad news. I suggest you get over the idea

&gt; this bus will be ready for a road trip in three weeks, regardless of
&gt; the 
&gt; condition it is in. Allow a minimum of six months to get the engine
&gt; and 
&gt; other mechanicals up to spec...  If anyone thinks

You're dead-on with 3 weeks being insufficient time.  I don't know if 6
months is too much or not, but I'd want that amount of time to drive
the bus locally before venturing off on the Great Adventure.

Another thing, since out poster is new to this game, is that we need to
emphasize that there are a lot of _bad_ choices that one can make on a
rebuild job.  GEX is the obvious one, but there are a lot of crate
engine builders out there that are equally bad.  I'm not a type iv guy,
but it seems that the best alternative is to find a local rebuilder of
good reputation and not-so-cheap prices.  Rock-bottom prices indicate
that the rebuilder is actually a reassembler and the result will be a
service limit rebuild with a minimum of new parts and a lifespan of not
much more than the advertised warranty.  What you want is a New-limits
rebuild.  Parts cost money!

I've heard good and bad about Mark Stephens, others with more data
should chime in here.
