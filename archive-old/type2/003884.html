Harmon,

Hmmmmm, you may be right. The last time I had a similar problem with
spontaneous highbeams I thought it was my turnsignal arm (I assume that is
what you are referring to.) After choking on the price and investigating
further I found my dimmer relay to be faulty(apparently dimmer relays have
an aversion to being filled with water from a leaky windshield.) I went to
switch out the relay with a spare but the one of the spades(prongs) on the
relay is a little to big to fit the connector in the fuse block.) The spare
dimmer relay came out of another 1972 bus but has a 411 prefix instead of a
211 prefix. Otherwise they are identical. Looks I might need to go pull a
used turnsignal arm.

Anyone know what years are compatible with 1972 model year buses? How about
repairing the existing one?Al Brase, did you post about this once?

Where will it end?
