Subject: Why is it Knocking ?

------=_NextPart_001_0003_01C25B5A.F8ABFB40

Hello Everyone..  This is kind of long.. I have a 78 Westy ..Only gets dr=
iven on weekends , and not everyone. I drove it back from Santa Cruz to S=
anta Rosa and parked it for two weeks .. started it up and it was making =
a ticking/ knocking noise. Turned it off and researched the list and deci=
ded that it was a lifter. Changed the oil to a lighter grade and ran it f=
or 20 minutes and it stopped making a noise. Drove it for a week ,no nois=
e,  parked it on a hill side ways for 9 hours , got in, started it and it=
 started knocking really loud. drove it 2 miles to my brothers house and =
then towed it home. started it up and drove in the garage.. Where it sits=
. .Started it again , pulled each plug wire and it still made noise...Sti=
ll thinking it's a lifter.. pulled valve covers, pushed in the rocker arm=
 where it attaches to push rod.. all cylinders where hard except #4 .. I =
can push in the push rod , on the intact and exhaust side. The question I=
 have is...Is this a soft lifter and will it make that kind of noise .. S=
hould I be checking other things....I really keep the maintenance up on t=
he Westy, never over heat it    Thanks in advance...

Tom        =20
