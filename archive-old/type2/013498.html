well, if it was a 72 up, you wouldn't have to cut all
that metal out of the rear, and then get a KEP
flywheel, and then you only have a 1.7 or 1.8L engine
stock, why not get Bernie Bergmann to build you a
nicely balanced 1.9L type 1 engine and save the bus,
or just get the later model bus w/2.0L already there -
makes sense $wise - yes or no
