jim:
i will be making one of these also- just finished
a nice one for splitty busses, out of 3/8 and 1/2 &quot;
steel, attaches in place of bumper at  the frame,
and remains behind bumper with tow section
removed...the original brackets are just sheet metal.

the late bus prior to 73 can use the same , but
i'm having a problem with the later pressed bumper
which bolts to the shell- the four  8 mm bolts which
mount the bumper are not adequate, and i don&quot;t think
the tow loops are safe, either.
so it looks like i will drill 1/2 inch holes in the frame rails
and fabricate brackets to there. was hoping to bolt up
without this, to tow new busses...
those flimsy tow bars they use on the beetles and early
busses which grab the lower beam are not safe...
