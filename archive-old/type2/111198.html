  eugene OR

After reading the threads on this and living near
Montgomery Alabama I had to throw my 2-cents worth in.
 Like David and Susan, we have few regulations felt by
most of the rest of America.  In my town a junker in
the yard only adds to the property value, a full tank
of gas is a plus!  It is not an uncommon sight to see
a car tooling down the road with no plate at all. 
Its just a car waiting for the permanent one to come
in the mail.  We have one license plate, if we had
two, DMV would get a bunch of calls asking which one
goes on front.  Probably why the Germans have a long
one in front and a square plate in back (spent 9 years
there).  To register a vehicle, as long as it's not on
fire you get a plate (only one), come to think of it
the last time I registered my car they didn't even
look at it so I guess it could be on fire!
Inspections?  The neighbors, family, friends, etc do
that when you bring it home for the first time. 
Surprising enough, there really arent too many cars
out there spewing clouds of smoke with parts falling
off, so thinking that this is the place where cars go
before they die would be a stretch unless its a VW
and they all end up in a big junk yard in Tuscaloosa
waiting for people like us.
