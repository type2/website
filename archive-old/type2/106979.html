&gt;I think 15 inch tires are different than 14 inch tires.  the wide part of the

Good point.  However I will say that there is not much clearance for chains on my bus either, around 3/4&quot; clearance between the tire and the fender, but I cinched them down tightly and tied up the loose ends and it was no problem.

&gt;The width of the contact patch (part that touches the road) on my 205/70-15 
&gt;is 166mm.  The stated width is at the widest part and not at the contact 
&gt;patch.  Check to see if your actual contact patch is any wider with a 
&gt;27x8.5x14.

I agree with your reasoning but in my case the width actually does make it to the ground.

&gt;In any case, it's really a myth that wider tires handle a lot better.

As someone who has raced with SCCA, I can't believe you would seriously make that statement.

&gt;  Tire 
&gt;compound, tire geometry and tread design have way more influence.

To coin a phrase, you are right but width is not trivial.  :-)

&gt;You are right that air resistance is by far the greatest force on a car, but 
&gt;rolling resistance is not trivial.  When I used to race street prepared cars 
&gt;in SCCA, wider tires would shave off a couple of miles an hour in straight 
&gt;line top speed.

But I bet you went faster through the corners and I bet your overall lap times decreased.  In a bus, it would also translate into more stability in crosswinds.
