&gt;Hello guys and dolls   I made my own using a flat piece of metal welded to a

I ground down the end of a junk Bug T-bar &quot;bumper&quot; (is there another kind of
T-bar bumper?) to use a few weeks ago when we needed one in a semi-hurry 
to finish up on a Notchback that was in the shop.  We'd gotten the runaround 
from Halsey Import Parts here in Portland about &quot;we don't have that tool&quot;,  but 
I could see it from where I stood.
