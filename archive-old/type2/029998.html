&gt; the lower diameter; presumably gave better spark?  Never seemed to

Oh, I can't resist, since I've just covered electrostatics with my
classes:

Electrostatics and spark plugs, or why splitfire plugs are crap:

Spark plugs work by exposing the air/fuel mixture to the high temperatures
(several thousand degrees) generated by a high voltage spark.  The
temperature generated by the spark depends upon the discharge voltage and
the energy allowed to build up in the system before the spark is
discharged.

The voltage of the spark is determined by the plug gap.  The bigger the
gap, the higher the voltage.  If the gap is very small, the spark will
always jump, but the voltage (and the energy buildup) will be small.  If
the gap is large, the voltage and energy buildup is large.  If the gap is
too large, the coil will not reach the voltage required for discharge, so
even though maximum energy has been stored, it is never released.

The shape of the electrode is also important.  Large rounded surfaces
allow a large energy buildup before discharge, while sharp jaggedy ones
allow the spark to occur with less energy buildup.  (this is why the
&quot;splitfire&quot; concept is kind of silly.  The electrode is more jagged, so
less energy builds up before discharge)  For maximum energy, you want
broad, rounded electrodes, like they get when they are a bit worn.
Unfortunately, if you let the wear go too far, you start to have problems
with discharge not occuring at all, which is called misfire.  This is also
the reason why the small-electrode platinum plugs may not be a good idea
for points-ignition buses.  They will discharge before the maximum energy
is allowed to build up unless they are fed with an ignition system
designed to feed them with current properly.

Filing the electrode back to the center of the center electrode is an old
trick designed to prevent misfires by allowing better contact between teh
fuel/air mixture and the spark.  It probably works, but it also causes
plugs to wear faster.
