Subject: Re: [T2] Rust, noise and heat

Hey All,

It seems like a lot of people are doing this now.

I've done some research and it seems that the type2 list archives
are generally in favor of the Bulley procedures.

The only dissenting voice I found was on the aircooled vw usenet 
newsgroup.  There was one post there saying that using tar was
a really bad thing because it never dries.

This gave me a little pause.  But Bulley gives raves reviews for
kool patch.  He clearly says that it does dry totally.  I would 
think that this contradiction might have come about by the usenet
guy using a different product or not using kool patch correctly.
I'm sure not all roofing tars are created equal, and I'm sure that
if you put too much on it would not dry.

I'm with Bulley.  Bully for Bulley.

Now, finding the stuff was a pain.  I highly recommend getting your qpads
from handsontools_dot_com.  They have the best price that I could find.  
$17.15 for the 6x12&quot; packs and $33 for the 4x16&quot; packs.  I ordered two
16&quot; and a bunch of 12&quot; packs.  handsontools gave me excellent service.
I ordered on a monday and it arrived on wednesday.  They forgot to 
include on of the packages and they had it shipped to me by the weekend.

I also found that a little went a long way.  Bulley says outside of
the hr&amp;n pages that 50-60% coverage produces good results and above
70% you don't get much gain.  I did a little over 50% and I think it
has worked out quite well.

Kool Patch seems to be hard to find.  Rumors of it being discontinued
are untrue.  I called Kool Seal and they verified it as being available.
Lowes and Home Depot didn't have it.  Lowes had other Kool Seal products,
but not kool patch.  I finally found it in a Strosniders Hardware up here.
Kool Seal recommended calling Ace &amp; True Value hardware stores.  Strosniders
is a True Value store.  I paid $8/gallon.

I bought heat shield insulation from JC Whitney.  I took about a week and
a half to arrive.  McMaster Carr is the current hot vendor on the list right
now.  They seem to have comparable stuff for cheaper prices.  Their catalog
is a little hard to follow.  I would probably look into that.  I would
encourage somebody to put together a Bulley McMaster Carr interchange
list.

Bulley is very serious about using Qpads.  He says they are the best.
I thought they worked very well.  They are expensive.  But worth it to
me, I think.

Good luck.

&gt; I have stripped out the interior of my bus and am getting ready to add some
&gt; sound deadening material and insulation. The rust, noise and heat website
&gt; has some info on it about sound deadening and insulation. Has anybody else
&gt; tried these methods? I think the sound deadening material, kool seal, heat
&gt; shield and insulation are all good, but has anybody used the foam to fill
&gt; cavities? I am a little scared that I might trap moisture in their and
&gt; create more rust than I had to start with. What are the opinions of the list
&gt; on this issue? What about weight and longevity? Does anybody know how this
&gt; bus is doing now? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
