Subject: Re: [T2] convert hydraulic to solid

&gt;I am thinking of converting my GEX rebuilt (by PO) &gt;in my '78 Westy from hydraulic lifters to solid &gt;ones.

I like hydraulics better. I've been putting off the valve adjustments in my 65 for too long now because I am a slacker/loser. 

I only to make 1 adjustment for the 3 years I owned my '79 powered 76 bus. Add the 10 years that the p.o. had it and never touched them (or anything else) and that's 1 valve adjustment in 13 years.

&gt;I only drive it once or twice every two weeks

Hydraulics will be noisy for a few minutes till they pump up. Or, start your bus once ore twice a week. Better for the engine anyway.

&gt;and quite frankly, hydraulic lifters confuse and &gt;frighten me.

Education is the cure to our fears.

&gt;I have burned 3 exhaust valves on this van since I &gt;have owned it, which has been for about a year and a &gt;half, and I wonder if the lifters have anything to &gt;do with it.

An admission. You WONDER if the lifters have anything to do with it.  I understand the annoyance of not knowing what's wrong and wasting money on repairs. Unfortunately, I think you're grasping at straws a little bit here.

&gt;I would feel better checking my valves every 3000 &gt;miles then never knowing what is going on back there.

Nobody says you can't check your valves with hydraulics either. A valve getting tight is a valve getting tight either way right?

&gt;Anyway, can I just drop some solid lifters in there &gt;or what?  Do I need new pushrods?

More variables for an unsolved problem.
Think about it awhile.

Billy
