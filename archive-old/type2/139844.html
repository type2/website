&gt; Who is/was Dr. Tim ? Why is he/she not blessing the mailing list anymore ?

Doc Tim was an iconoclast from some island in NW Washington state. knew
his stuff and probably still hangs out  here occasionally. he is a
perfectionist and doesn't think much of doing it anything but perfect
regardless the cost.

he's a neat guy and he is missed but he got so much greif I don't blame
him for not posting too much.

&gt; I replaced the locked star adjuster on the rear left drum over the week-end
&gt; and adjusted. Too much hammering, drilling, filing , i really felt like a
&gt; non-pro...

nah, that's pretty much par for the course if it hasn't been maintained,
which is about 99.9% of em.

&gt; - Van still steers to the left at the beginning of breaking and then to the
&gt; right when the pedal is released :(
&gt; - Front right wheel is warm after my 12 miles commute
&gt; - Front left wheel is not warm after 12 miles commute
&gt; The right front brakes is sticky and slow to react to brake fluid pressure.

CHANGE your flex brake hoses to your wheels, sounds like they may be
swollen inside, this is a warning of imminent failure.

&gt; It will be a pleasure to check this out now that the sun is back in socal -
&gt; sorry we got the nice weather back. Yes the camper is two inches too tall
&gt; for the garage...

let some air out of your tires to get the camper in to work on. do you
have enough head room to raise it once inside.

good luck
Bob
