The wife just hauled home this morning (well I did...) an automatic 81 =
Westy with 123k miles.  It will need an engine, leaks a little oil, No =
compression in No. 2 and very little in No. 1.  But it started right up =
after sitting over 2 years.... same old gas.  Anyways, I am thinking of =
just buying a longblock to save the time of doing it myself.  I dont =
want to mess around with it myself, it needs to be reliable since my =
wife doesnt know a screwdriver from a carburetor.  Anyone know of a good =
quality, reasonable priced source for one of these later busses?  Also, =
are these automatic trannies any good???  TIA  Gerald
