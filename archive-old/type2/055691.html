&gt;Subject: how much would it be

&gt;Howdy,
&gt;I was just wondering...is it possible to convert a regular bus into a
westy. I
&gt;know its a dumb question (stop laughing),  but I'm new.  If it is how much
&gt;does it cost (aproximate).  Can you actually buy all of the stuff for a
westy
&gt;(cabinets windows, pop top, range, etc.) Just a thought

Personally I would exoect it would be cheaper to buy a westy (or what ever
conversion you want).
Here in the UK there are many companies who still supply interiors for
campers that will fit a type 2.
I personnaly am going to refit my van (the story of stripping to transfer to
another van was published here before) with an interior that fits my needs.
