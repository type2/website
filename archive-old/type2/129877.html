Subject: Re: [T2] driving advice?

Karen, remove the old and install a new. The diaphram inside the pump is leaking. Allows fuel to get into the crank case and dilute the oil  accelrating the engine wear depending on how much fuel is in the oil. To me - any fuel in the oil is too much. 

While you are at it, disconnect the battery, shoo the smokers far away, and drain the gas tank by slicing a fuel line and letting it drain into a gas can. Use this fuel in your lawn mower. 

Now remove each section of fuel line and reinstall the new equivalent (new rubber fuel lines). Also put you a fuel filter (plastic or metal) between the tank and the fuel pump. Change that oil too. 

Now you're done. 

You'll need a flat blade screw driver, fuel can, maybe a funnel, a pencil or golf tee to stop up the line in case you need to exchange a full gas can for an empty one. The fuel pump will require a 13mm wrench to take it's two nuts off. You might also replace the gasket under the pump. 

Make sure you do this away from your house and cars, keep an fire ext. handy, and also bring the phone outside with you to call 911 if need be. I've never had a vehicle fire but gasoline will go up FAST. 

A bit of help isn't a bad thing either. Good luck! If you have John Muir's book, he explains this pretty good and it's not a bad read. 

Chris
