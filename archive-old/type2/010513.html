Hello,

     I will be moving on the 5th of November and of course my '70 
transporter is going with me. Only problem is that the motor is still in 
pieces. I will be towing the bus with a car dolly behind the Ryder truck 
that I am renting.
Is there any  way that I can tow without having to remove the trans? I know 
I will have to disconnect the drive shafts but I don't want to take the 
whole trans out. I will be traveling about 850 miles so I need to figure out 
a way to make sure that the trany will be safe. I'm open to ideas so put 
your thinking caps on and warm up those typeing fingers.

Thank you all in advance.

Blake Jorgenson
