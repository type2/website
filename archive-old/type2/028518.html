Subject: RE: [T2] rear axle fell off (!)

There was a VW service bulletin many years ago that stated *not* to use the
serrated washers or any other type of lock washer on the CV bolts.  Instead
they recommended 3 more ft lbs of torque on the bolts making it 28.

&gt; My half shaft had loosened bolts when I inspected them the first time too.
&gt;
&gt; May just be the nature of the beast.
&gt;
&gt; Your CV joint may be fine and require a simple reinstall.
&gt;
&gt; Lock-tite anyone?

I wouldn't use lock-tite here.  These bolts are usually difficult to remove
and lock-tite wouldn't help things at all.

One thing to check is that the serrated lock-washers are in place beneath
the bolt heads, as well as the three 2-hole plates.  Good boot
kits come with new bolts and sometimes the link plates, but I've never seen
them come with the washers.  I've always cleaned and
re-used the lock washers and link plates with the new bolts.

These lock washers are rather unique and I cannot recall seeing them in any
other application in the bus.  They are neither a spring
washer or a wave washer.  They have a serrated pattern on their bearing
faces that seems to lock the bolts rather well.

If I couldn't prevent loosening of these bolts, I'd use safety wire before
lock-tite.  At least then I'd be able to get the bolts out when I wanted
to!  :)
