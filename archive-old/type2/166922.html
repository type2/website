Hi JT,

That would be fine if I could stabilize the idle.... But right now I  
can't seem to do that.

Other things have kept me from it until just now... I am going  
outside to do battle momentarily and will report back later.



Happy Trails,

&gt; Why not just tach it up and set total timing?  If it's hitting 30  
&gt; at 2500 rpm then you can set the idle where it's comfortable with  
&gt; it and it shouldn't go below 7.5.  I only set initial timing static  
&gt; before startup and once it's running I set total and call it good.
