Subject: '7? Westy delux prices

Hi volks,
               This may be of little interest as it's UK (well, Europe) specific information but it seems to me that the natural cap on baywindow camper prices is the cost of a brand new baywindow camper, since even  an undriven early 70's camper won't be worth much more than an undriven '90s one.
 This suggests a ceiling in the UK of about 16,000 pounds, though an undriven RHD Westy might fetch a little more.
 UKL 16000 is about $25,000, but car prices in the UK are ridiculously high (you can import a US car, convert it to RHD+UK spec and still be ahead a few thousand pounds) so it's probably more realistic to convert at parity.
 I'd say an undriven Westy from the mid seventies ought to be worth about $16,000, but you might want to add a premium for rarity since you can't easily get a new one.
 OTOH- if you had such a vehicle you'd need to find a buyer who was prepared to pay that much for it, which might be difficult: I guess you'd auction it, as with other rare vehicles like 911RSRs and hope you got a group of competing bidders.
 At any rate- I'm inclined to agree that while I wouldn't want to spend $10,500 on a Westy,  there are probably quite a few people who would be happy to drop that much cash on the right car.

Cheers,
              W.
