&lt;&lt; Just received a call from Teresa Koch--Bob Scott of Vintage Parts in
 California passed away in his sleep--Vintage Parts and Bob Scott are one
 of the class acts in the VW Hobby==Bob is survived by his lovely wife
 Beverly-- any one who has had the privilage of knowing Bob Scott knows
 what a didicated VW and just VWonderful person he was--I'm certain the
 Lord will have a Vintage VW for Bob to tool around in. &gt;&gt;

 Bob will be missed. Bob would was one of the first people to step up and help
us by donating gifts for the raffles at the Bulli Brigade shows, and everyone
knows how hard it is to get raffle prizes. Living in Florida I never was able
to meet Mr. Scott, but did talk to him on the phone once or twice. I remember
seeing him on the 1989 SOTO  video put out by RAZ productions and he was
joking around and telling stories, seems like the kind of guy who would let
you come to his shop just to BS.
