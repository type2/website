Subject: Re: [T2] Bay windshield installation

John,

Sounds more interesting now(I'm from Missouri/and believe you).

Did the rubber have chrome molding in it like some of our buses have(mine 
does)?

Maybe I should try this method on my slider(aluminum frame) windows in my 
78...they are a royal pain to get in with the rubber already on them cause 
the aluminum frame doesn't give much.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Goodmorning:
&gt;      I used to put glass in at Ford motor co. Just thought I would tell you
&gt; how we did on an assembly line which is constantly moving.
&gt;      Put rubber in window put in string apply lub. (ah lot) have a friend
&gt; with vac. cups (suckers) to hold window, bring the window into the auto and
&gt; pulling it (window) to the outside as the person on the inside pulls the
&gt; string around the window.  This is how we did it at Ford and it worked
&gt; great on the assembly line. (non stop)
