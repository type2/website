Hi Shad,

This page has an excellent list of type4 engine codes and their  
applications:
http://www.tunacan_dot_net/t4/reference/case.htm

Up here in Canada we call it a Metric Buttload; but I am not sure  
what the conversion rate is the same amount in Standard/Imperial/ 
Whitworth/? Buttloads.


Happy Trails,

&gt; Hi All,

My neighbor down the street acquired a whole buttload (scientific  
term for many thousands of pounds and lots of volume) of VW parts.   
Among them is a type4 engine.

It came off an automatic transmission, it is fuel injected (some of  
the system is still there), but I didn't get a good enough look at it  
to get an engine number.  I don't have a tranny/starter to put on it  
to check compression, so I'll have to resort to a wrench to make sure  
it turns over good (remove plugs first), and pull the valve covers to  
check that none of them are terribly messed up.  IE, dropped valve  
standing 1/4&quot; proud of the others, etc)

I offered him $150-200 for it.  That seems to be the running price  
around here for a condition-unknown type 4 engine.   Doesn't really  
matter, as when I acquire an engine it'll get stripped bare and  
rebuilt completely.

I'm pretty sure I have this right, but isn't the type4 engine case  
the same from 1800cc up to 2L?  Any specific engine code I should shy  
away from?  Any spot check I should perform to check for terrible  
engine damage quickly?
