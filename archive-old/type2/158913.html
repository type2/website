But its kind of fun on a slow work day :) I have bought from
Aircooled on multiple occasions partially because they are close to me
and I don't have to deal with shipping, but also because John has been
very helpful explaining things to even a dummy like me.

In this day of googling and online forums, if he is such a rip off
for our bus parts, how come so many people are still buying from him?
