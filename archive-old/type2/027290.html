Subject: Insurance for 1974 in Mexico

I am planning a two month camping trip down to Mexico (from Canada) in a 
1974 Westfalia.

The problem is not in Canada or the USA - any insurance you buy from here 
(or USA) is not valid once you cross the border.  You must have Mexican 
insurance to be valid in Mexico.  So far the information I have found 
indicates that I can only purchase liability insurance for any vehicle older 
than 20 years.  It is my understanding that Mexico goes by the Blue Book 
value and anything that old is deemed &quot;worthless&quot; regardless of appraised 
values etc.  I gather insurance companies think they are too expensive/hard 
to fix.

I am very concerned about collision and theft - does anyone have any 
experiences with an older vehicle in Mexico and insurance and/or accidents?  
  Any advice for what we can do?
Thanks, Jane

PS - I am new to this list - and hope that I'm not breaking any rules.  
Please let me know if I do!
