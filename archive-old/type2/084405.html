Subject: Pop out rear window

Does anybody have experience Bluebird's  (http://www.bluebird-type2.co_dot_uk/)
pop out rear window? I think this is a great idea for the back of the my bus
because it gets somewhat hot back there and air flow is limited. I sometimes
leave the back hatch open slightly to get some air flow, but a pop out
window would be ideal. I am wondering how well this window seals? I would
hate to add one and then find out I get exhaust fumes coming in the back.
Anybody have any thoughts or experiences with this type of window.

Also, anybody know where you can get one in the US to eliminate these high
prices and shipping from the UK?

Thanks,
Corbett
