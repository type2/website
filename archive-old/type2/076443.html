Subject: Re: [T2] Oil bottle spout

Most of the FLAPS in my area sell a red plastic spout that also acts as a
shutoff valve. Works great to keep the spills to zero. I just tip the spout
into the filler neck, give it a twist, then the oil goes where it should. If
I don't need the whole quart, I shine a flash light through the bottle and
close the valve when I think enough ha gone in the engine. Great for the
busses that like their oil in liters instead of quarts!

&gt; I figured since the list is kinda slow tonight this would be ok. I found
&gt; a red plastic nozzle at WMart tonight that snaps onto
&gt; a oil bottle real easy. It makes pouring oil a breeze. It also came with
&gt; a couple other nozzles to use on other size containers.
&gt; It cost two bucks .
&gt;
&gt; Required bus content: I was able to pour oil in my bus with no funnel
&gt; without spilling it : )
