Subject: RE:Adding a pop top

Okay, I was considering this myself.  After all the pro's and con's
thrown out lately I think I will look for the small top.  The one that
starts behind the front seats and stops at the post behind the slider.
No major support removal. I just want to stand UP.

Any one have one to sell or maybe a location of one?
