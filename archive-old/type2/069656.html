If the're 36's they aren't all that freakin' big. The stock carbs on the 
72-74 buses were 34's. Dellorto also makes 40's that can be used on these 
engines. Dellorto makes good carbs from what I've heard.

OK, folks.  Since I got a bunmch of responses I went home over lunch and
grabbed some info.  Let me know if I get anything wrong.

The carbs were used on a '75 (pancake) 1800 engine, code ED010179.
They're made by Dellorto, and I think the model is &quot;DRLA36&quot;.
