&gt; &gt;  In the three years I have had my '71 camper I have
&gt; &gt; noticed that new parts are scarce.  You seem to be
&gt; &gt; able to get parts up to 1970 and 1972 up with no
&gt; &gt; problem, but no '71s.  Does anyone have an answer for
&gt; &gt; this, or am I just crazy. . .

&gt; Only a few parts peculiar to 71 type 2's come to mind: Front brake
&gt; calipers, pads, rear brake shoes (?), Front engine tin, transmission
&gt; (bellhousing only- rest of trans is like 70).
&gt; This seems like no more an orphan year than any other to me.


With very rare exception I have not had any more difficulty supplying '71
parts than other years.  Even most of the one-year-only parts are still
available, and at roughly the same price as other years. Perhaps you are
using the wrong suppliers. :-)
