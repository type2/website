Subject: Re: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

John,

Haleluja! on the weber and kdog mods.  That cures one problem that we all=
=20
had when we wanted more carburation for hotter engines....

Is the kdog mod something that we can do at home?...I have some svda dists=
=20
that I would love to try on my 1776 with kdogs.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; We are starting to modify Kadrons here for a vacuum port so the K-Dog

&gt; &gt; I can't remember how old you are, but in the late 60's early 70's the 0=
10
&gt; &gt; was the choice...009 because all the 010 were snapped up and gone.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The reason for them was the proliferation of aftermarket carb kits(holl=
ey
&gt; &gt; and others) that had *no* provision for correct vacuum readings for a v=
ac
&gt; &gt; advance dist.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I ran holley bugspray's out the wazoo and you had to use a mech advance
&gt; &gt; dist because of the vacuum problem.  And yes, I still run Holley
&gt; &gt; occasionally and I *can* make them work right&lt;grin&gt;.....even with a 009=
=2E
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We have all learned a lot since those times and sometimes forget that w=
hat
&gt; &gt; we know now is the culmination of 30+ years of knowledge on vw's.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That the 009 is *not* the answer for most people, but why we went there=
 to
&gt; &gt; start with.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hope you all enjoyed that trip down memory lane!&lt;grin&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to add something that I find interesting.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; we sell a modified distributor we term the SVDA, it has a 009
&gt; centrifugal
&gt; &gt; &gt; curve, with the addition of vacuum advance. The vac pots are used, an=
d
&gt; &gt; &gt; occasionally develop a hole or leak, rendering the vacuum advance
&gt; &gt; &gt; inoperable. The timing specs for the 009 and our SVDA are identical.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's humorous the mail I get when one of the vacuum cans destructs li=
ke
&gt; &gt; &gt; this, comments like &quot;it runs like shite without that vacuum can&quot;, or
&gt; &gt; &gt; something similar. I send them a new can, and point out that with an
&gt; &gt; &gt; inoperable vacuum advance, they have a 009 advance curve.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, unless you have compared an SVDA to a 009, there is no basis for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;comparison&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The 009 is inexpensive, and available new. The 009 proponents will cl=

&gt; &gt; &gt; it's superiority to vac advance distributors, why didn't VW supply th=

&gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; their beetles and busses, especially since it was so much less $ ? VB=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Did I mention that most [hush tim, I said most! :)] mechanics are
&gt; &gt; &gt; clueless
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about advance curves and how they relate to the combustion process=
?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Perhaps there is a reason that VW NEVER EVER EVER put a [currently
&gt; &gt; &gt; common]
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;009 on a typ1, typ3, or typ4 engine?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The best value of an 009 is it only wastes $50 or so to get by unti=
l
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find a better curved dizzy. This does not include the T-IV motor. I=
t's
&gt; &gt; &gt; dead
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrong and cannot in any way meet specs.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have verified curves on a number of 009's and have found in the
&gt; cases
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where they were not worn they all hit within a degree or two of 25=
=B0
&gt; total
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; range. The 009 is shown by Bosch as a suitable replacement for some=
 VW
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engines, but not the T-IV in any case.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Standard procedure when first installing and running any new or use=
d
&gt; dizzy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is verifying the curve with a tack and timing light. Plot the
&gt; advance/rpm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every 500 rpm up to total advance. Compare your curve with stock. I=
f
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are within the stock curve min-max area at all rpm's, you can use i=
t
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expect suitable function. If not, find a better fit ASAP.
