Subject: 73 vs. 75

Is there any interchangability between a 73 transport and a 75 westy?  I have 
the opertunity to relieve a restorable bus from a friend in need, for a very 
reasonable $.  
but i don't want it if i can't at least use some of it for my westy.  Please 
let me know ASAP, I'm supposed to check out the bus soon.
