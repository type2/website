Subject: For sale in N.IL 1969 Camper cheap

--part1_55.19f4f636.28ae9161_boundary

I have for sale a 1969 camper. Newer pop-top canvas. Has camping interior 
minus cots and sink.  Bus has no engine in it. I will throw an engine core in 
with the sale of the bus.  Body has some rust but nothing really horrible. 
Has both front and rear bumpers in fair condition. Could be a good daily 
driver, parts bus, restoration. Whatever you want to do. I need 300 dollars 
for it. The parts on the bus alone are worth the money I am asking. I have 
way to many projects right now starting school in 3 days and tuition is due 
in 5 days. Will have pictures on Saturday afternoon. Other parts and buses 
also for sale if you need something just ask good chance I may have it. Thanks
