Subject: Re- Bilge blowers (long)

Some of you will find this trivial ( and I apologize to you for the wasted
bandwidth), but my sense is that others of you may find this helpful..  

I suspect that bilge blowers, as a class, are pretty powerful fans that move a
lot of air.  They are probably at least as powerful as heater a/c blowers in
American cars, or equivalent to the electric radiator fan and thus draw a lot
of amps.  

1)  The resistors used in series with the fan motor to reduce the speed of the
fans are big high wattage (but low resistance) units.  The ones in the heater
a/c blowers usually sit in the blower's output flow to cool the resistor and
keep it from burning up.  

2)  The way to select a resistor for this application depends on a couple of
factors:         
      a)  the motor's rating.  Typically 14 volts at some rated current in
amps -- if I was to make a wild guess, maybe 10 amps??? 
      b)  what reduced voltage(s) do you need to get it to run at the desired
speed(s)??

  For each desired speed, you will need to determine the applied voltage  that
will run the blower at that speed and the current that it draws at that speed.


      The value of the resistor (in ohms) is determined by the difference
between the supply voltage (14) and the desired voltage to determine the
necessare voltage drop across the resistor and the current draw of the motor. 


       For example, if the desired voltage is 10 volts, then the voltage drop
across the resistor is 14-10=4 volts. 

      The current that the motor draws at 10 volts will determine the value of
the resistor in ohms as well as the wattage rating of the resistor. 
Specifically: if the motor draws 9 amps at 10 volts {which by the way is 90
watts - a non trivial load!!), the the value of the resistor can be determined
from Ohm's law: volts= current(amps) x resistance (ohms).   Resistance = volts
(4) / amps (9) = 4/9 = 0.44 ohms.  

     The power dissipated in the resistor is the voltage drop across the
resistor times  the current through it, in this example, 4 volts x 9 amps = 36
watts.  

Practical application in this example would say that a 0.47 ohm resistor would
probably do ( should be a standard value, or pick the standard value closest
to 0.44 ohms) and needs to be be higher than 36 watts.  Probably 50 watts 
would give a good safety factor.  Typically, resistors of this nature are wire
wound and coated with a ceramic or are in an aluminum housing that is designed
to dissipate heat or be bolted to a heat sink.  Now, you have to mount this
somewhere  and somehow so that the dissipated heat won't create problems for
things attached or near to it.

I have not checked to see what Radio Shack carries , but I kind of doubt that
they stock resistors of this nature/power handling/resistance.  An electronic
supply place  or an automotove dealer (replacement reistors for electric
radiator fans) might be places to start.  If you can't find a specific single
resistor you can always use multiple resistors in parallel.  Remember that
when resistors are wired in parallel, the power dissipation of the resultant
combination is equivalent to the sum of the power dissipation of each of the
resistors (using identical resistors).  To calculate the resistance of two
paralle resistors, use R(equiv) = R(a)*R(b)/ [R(a)+R(b)]  .  IF you need to
use more than two resistors, you can calculate the equivalent resistance by
using the above formula on the first two to get their equivalent resistance,
and the treat that value as if it were a single resistor and combine it with
the next resistor.  To equally share the power and voltage drops across all
resistors, use the same value resistor and power dissipation for all the
resistors you combine.  (Actually, two identical resistors in parallel have an
equivalent of a single unit with half the resistance and twice the power
dissipation, 3 identical in parallel, one third the resistance, 3X the
dissipation, etc.

hope this is useful/helpful
