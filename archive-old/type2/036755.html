Subject: wacking the starter motor..?

Hello list members
I have  a 74 kombi campervan and it runs reliably when I drive it
around to town and on trips of an hour or so, but recently I went
on a long distance (2000 Km) camping trip and after driving for
about 3 hours ( the day was hot about 32degrees C) , I stopped
for a break about 30 mins then when I went to start my kombi, to
my horror there was no sound of the starter kicking over this had
never happened before, I checked the horn and headlights to see
if the battery was flat but there was plenty of juice coming
through, I imedeately went under the van to check for wiring
probs...everything looked ok, at this point in time another kombi
camper had pulled up and the driver approached and offered to
help, after explaining the prob to him he asked if I had a hammer
in the car of which I had and gave to him.He then went under the
van and whacked the starter motor , and asked me to start the
kombi  and to my surprise it started. Well I thanked him and
after a few beers we were on our separate ways. I noticed this
continued to happen but only after long drives on hot days.
At the first chance I had I bought and replaced the brushes and
cleaned arond the commutator , but to no avail . The kombi starts
after it cools down or after short trips but the prob comes back
when Idrive for more than3 hours on hot days.
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Oh and while I've got you all .. there is this grinding sound
that happens when I reverse up driveways, it only lasts a short
time but it is concerning.. hope it not the clutch.

Thanks in advance....hope you can help!.
