Subject: Online Bus Raffle--Legal Issues; Take Note...

&gt;&gt;OK---Give me some input---Is this ethical/Legal---

&gt;Count me in!  Where do I mail the 25.00 check?

Okay, listees, listen up:

I have no idea what the legal status of this might be. Where I am, this is
not legal. Where the list &quot;is&quot;, legally, I have no idea. Where Joe C. is,
or what the statutes might be there, I have no idea either.

Here's what we're gonna do:

You can talk about a bus raffle, in general. You can describe the bus. But
you can't solicit, and you can't reply to a solicitation.

In other words, don't mention a dollar amount, give a physical address,
commit to any transaction, or say anything that could be construed as an
advertisement rather than merely an announcement (or respond to such an ad
either).

Of course, if you wish to send Joe pmail, it's none of my business.
