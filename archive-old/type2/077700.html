Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Valves

Chris Mills sends:

&gt; I like the solenoid idea. Just cycle it with the ignition or a separate
&gt; switch. Might require occasional use to keep it free.

Wire it to the hot side of the coil. That will give it all the use you want;
it will open the valve every time you turn the key to on. Put a fusible link
in the wire to it and it will automatically turn off if the engine catches
fire. Why? Because if the engine catches fire, you're probably going to
forget to turn the key off in your haste to put out the fire.

I was going to suggest one of my former customers' products: the Flow-Tek
Automator. It is used in factories to automatically turn ball valves--good
if you're formulating chemical mixtures. I didn't mention it because it's
bigger than a cylinder head, more expensive than one too, and it runs on
compressed air.
