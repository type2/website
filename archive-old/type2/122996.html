Subject: Re Jack

It looks like a regular
VW jack, has a round base, but it has a hex bolt head that a handle would
go
onto for cranking.  The only markings on it are &quot;Bilstein&quot; on the part that

goes into the jackpad.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FWIW the jack that came with my 78' westy is just like this, it takes the
lug wrench to crank it up. Works fine, I use it frequently when camping to
level the bus. Fridge works better that way... My understanding of Bilstein
is that they made a number of things for VW including jacks and shock
absorbers.
