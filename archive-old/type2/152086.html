&gt; OK.  So I found some free westy seats here locally.  They'll have to do
&gt; until I can come up with better ones.  How do I go about removing the
&gt; seats in my 78?

BFH,  ok ok.  lots of PBblaster. on the tracks, hold lever up and push,
try to do it straight. whack push, curse, whack push curse repeat.
getting the drivers side out may require removing the steering wheel,
sometimes yes, sometimes it will go, very close.  clean track before
putting new one in.
