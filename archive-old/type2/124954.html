Subject: Re: [T2] bridgestone dueller A/T tires

This will be my last post on this subject. I am tired of trying to explain something as simple as this.
Long ago I was told to never argue with an idiot...... they just bring you down to their level and then beat
you with experience.

Remember when I said 'load range does not mean squat'?
Well, you people can read whatever you want into the term but in reality it is a pisspoor name for ply rating.
Folks, that's all it is: Ply Rating. It has nothing to do with how much weight it will actually carry going
down the road. Load range C is 6 ply rating. How many Load range C tires have you seen that are 6 ply??
Probably none! Just about all are 4 ply. Sorry, but if I buy a tire that is 6 ply rated, it damn sure better
have 6 plys! I have seen 2 ply tires that were rated at B or 4 ply rated. Sorry, some other sap can but those
2 ply tires, I won't.
Here you go if you doubt me:           http://www.autosite_dot_com/library/diction/dict0110.asp

Now when I said 'What is the max load weight on the sidewall?'
THAT is the tell tale truth of the tire. The max load weight in pounds will be on any and all tires. It may
also appear as a Load Index number like 98 or 99 etc.
This site shows a chart, however it is in kg. http://www.federaltire_dot_com/TireTips-LI.htm

This site explains it all: http://www.dualport_dot_com/bustech/load_tires.html

It has the Load Index figures in kg. and lbs.

It also has links to explain what happened to the Ford Explorer when people decided to experiment with tire
pressure to get a better ride.

Enjoy the reading and learn something!  Goodbye.
