Subject: Re: [T2] Top Ten Things I LOVE about drivng my VW

Racing a bug at santa pod drag strip and winning.
The fact that even a 4 mile trip to work is an adventure.
The Porsche 914/412 engine a previous owner installed.
The holiday starts as soon as we get in the van.
The fact I can and do work on it.
The waves from other VW air cooled drivers.
The view.
The fact both me and my wife can work on/in it together.
The look on the guys face as we did 90 mph back from Sandown park when he 
tried to over take.
Knowing there are other people out there like me (the list).
