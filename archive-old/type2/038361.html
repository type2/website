Great post, Sammy. Must agree in the main with all. Worn carbs are not the
way to go. Neither is worn F.I. When all is in good order, F.I. wins the
efficientcy and best fuction bid. If you go to carbs without an F.I. cam
profile, it's a compromise. 

With carbs, you need the higher precision/better value linkage arrangements
that only come with higher cost kits or you are plagued with poor balance
throughout travel with a sloppy pedal. Best power and torque can only be
found with a cam change, which means motor teardown. Not the quick cheap fix. 

As well, the quality of the manifolds with all but the best kits is simply
lacking. Poor fit prevails meaning much juris-rigus to install. 

You need specialized skills, manuals and tools to set up and troubleshoot
either.
