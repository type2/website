&gt;Hmm that's weird. I would never consider putting guages in my volkswagen. 
&gt;I think it's an aftermarket snow job.

Chris,

I hate to say this but you are SO wrong!  Take the following scenario as
justification for my opinion - you are driving down the road and
unbeknownst to you a plastic bag gets sucked into your side scoop and into
your engine fan.  The driver with gauges notices that his CHT and oil temp
are suddenly going up very fast, pulls over and removes the bag.  The
driver with no gauges motors happily along until his engine overheats and
locks up.  

Now that I think about it, maybe you were kidding?  :)
