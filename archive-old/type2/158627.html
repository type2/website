Subject: distributor drive gear washer /spacer

hello bus faithful
             today i recieved a package form the bus depot, i open it and
the washer/ spacer for the distibutor drive gear was backordered. it is for
a 78 transporter 2.0 FI.   my question is,   is this a special washer, is it
metal, plastic, rubber, what size is it?  can i just go to the home depot
and buy a standard washer the same size?  i have checked other online
retailer but either i cant find them on the website or they dont have any.
what other options do i have besides waiting until the bus depot recieves
more or if they even get any ever?    any ideas?   thanks you guys in
advance.
