Subject: Re: [T2] How to find TDC to verify Distributor is not 180
  degrees off?

&gt; How could I verify 1 is TDC without the notch in the distributor?
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Remove the 3/4 valve cover.
Get a remote starter button and connect it to the starter.
Rotate the engine in the direction and watch the #3 valves.
When the exhaust JUST closes and the intake JUST starts to open,
STOP and look at your timing mark. It should be on zero.
This is #1 at TDC on the comression stroke. 
Your dist rotor should be pointing to #1 to fire.
