Subject: Re: [T2] Junk oil filters was Re: [T2] *Long distance drivers

Its also a good idea to fill the filter with oil before installing it on the
engine. Why let your engine starve for oil for even a second when it doesn't have
to.

&gt; compete with the crap market and are crap. Get the Mahle filters, or
&gt; genuine VW, which are made by Mahle. Everything else is risky. And if you
&gt; change your oil BEFORE is gets filthy, you can reuse the filter a second
&gt; time and your cost is no more than using the cheap junk.
&gt;
&gt; Look at the threads. If they have burrs and sharp edges they are junk
&gt; production. If they are smooth and nicely formed like the Mahle, Kneckt,
&gt; Mann or Hengst you have at least some empirical evidence of quality
&gt; production. Always smear some clean oil on the seal and a few drops on the
&gt; threads for installation and wipe the mount clean then turn them down
&gt; tightly by hand. Note that ALL European production comes off the showroom
&gt; with these quality brand filters only.
