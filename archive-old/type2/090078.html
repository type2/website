&gt; Interesting concept, and I know that there are many opinions on this

&gt;
&gt; However, I have seen many brand new, old style Bugs that have been
&gt; imported from Mexico---South America, in the Sunday Chicago Tribune for
&gt; sale----
&gt;
&gt; How are these vehicles made available?

2 ways.  One is to register the vehicle as a &quot;specially constructed&quot;
vehicle (as you would a dune buggy)  The other way is to put all new
Beetle parts on an old refurbished pan.  That's how Beetlemex does it.

Unfortunately, the bus has no separate &quot;chassis&quot; like a bug.
