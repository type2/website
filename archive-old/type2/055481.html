&gt;&gt;I've always had this stupid idea of doing a custom Microbus in all black.
&gt;
&gt;Seems to me that if you wanted to have a badass vehicle that was all black,
&gt;it shouldn't be a bus.  Kinda like you wouldn't see Barney featured on the
&gt;cover of Guns 'n Ammo totin' an M16 and wearing an ammo belt.

Ah, but this is sort of the point.  What if you could shoehorn a Porsche 
flat six in there?  Get it to some really ungodly number of horsepower, 
but keep this all relatively well concealed.  Someone (an Italian, 
probably) once said &quot;Most people want a car that looks fast when it's 
going slow.  I want a car that looks slow when it's going fast.&quot;  So 
people in obvious muscle cars would write you off moments before you 
unleashed on pavement hundreds of more horsepower than VW ever intended 
to be connected to a Microbus.
