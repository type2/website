Subject: Adventurewagen

All,

Well, I have somewhat recovered from my weekend adventures, now I am 
thinking about fixing the issues that came to my attention.  Is there 
any adventurewagen specific info available on the net or ?.

My first issue is that the windows in the fiberglass top have been 
sealed shut.  They look like they might be missing some pieces.  Anyone 
have some of these lying around?

Thanks in advance,

Dave
