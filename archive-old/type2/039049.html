Subject: Webber jetting question

Hey y'all
The Burrito Express is alive and well after rear wheel bearing
replacement operation this weekend.  I still have the left side to do
and will post pics and procedure based on that one not that I
successfully did it once.

But I digress.

I think the carb is running way lean.  It's a Weber 32/36 DFEV.  I know
they're known to run lean.  Also, they've been used on 1800s (pancakes)
for years.  I'm looking for what the jetting for this thing should be.
Any suggestions folks?

She runs real well.  I notice though that at highway speed she gets
warmer than I'm happy with.  At slower speeds (50&lt;) she gives good gas
mileage (24+) and runs fairly cool.  I'm not complaining about the
mileage but I think it's a little TOO good.  Timing is spot on,
Pertronics electronic in lieu of points.  1776, 90.5s x 69.  CB
performance cam, comparable to an EMPI 110.  Headers with dual quiet
packs.  New everything.

Engine seals in place where they're supposed to be.  Doghouse cooler.
