Subject: lenth of stock A/C belt for 78 westy

Hello Again,
        I was wondering if anyone out there might remember the length of the
A/C belt for a 78 with the stock York compressor. VWOA list the part as
discontinued but could only give me the old number not the length. Why didn't
that surprise me. I Know the old system isn't the best on earth but since its
all in tact and in good shape I wouldn't mind taking advantage of it. Once I
get the size I should be able to order a V belt at my FLAP.
Thanks
Greg Goforth
