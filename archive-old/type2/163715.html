I'm  planning to get a
new aluminum case, so it won't matter so  much


Hello mark  There was a lot of bad things being said about the  aluminum 
cases , have they fixed all the problems that they were having??   I do know that 
they weigh more and that they should be stronger and that there  was something 
about them running hotter and leaking oil. I haven't check on them  latey so 
please let me know if they are any good or not. later  Mark  Dearing
