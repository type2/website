Subject: Intermittent knock-knock noise

Hi Volks:

I have a 79 Westy in great condition, around 80K miles, always maintained in 
top shape.

I have recently moved to Santa Fe, NM from California.
The weather is substantially colder and we are at 7000 feet.

I have been experiencing a noise that resembles a knocking that goes from 
barely noticeable to downright frightening. The rythm seems to go along with 
the speed of the van, i.e. the faster the speed the faster the rythm of the 
noise. The noise is present on gear and out of gear. It seems to be louder 
inside than outside the van. At times it almost feels as if a part was 
knocking on the body of the van.

I have brought the van to Foreign Aide in Albuquerque (a 60 mile ride in the 
cold) twice in the last 2 weeks and twice the noise disappeared not to come 
back until I was back in Santa Fe...

Foreign Aide checked the van and drove it after cooling off to no avail, no 
noise. Yet, on the second attempt I had someone follow me all the way from 
Santa Fe, so sure I was that the van was going to quit on me; about 7 miles 
from the garage the noise stopped that day. The mechanic at Foreign Aide 
said that without the noise, it wasdifficult to do anything. Thatit sounded 
like a CV joint problem, but that it was going to cost me dearly if they 
were going to have to dismantle all four. I asked them if altitude could 
have anything to do with it (there is a 2000 feet drop between Al. and SF) 
and they reply that no, not with this kind of noise.

So I am back to square one.

Anybody with a similar problem that could comment ?

Thanks.
