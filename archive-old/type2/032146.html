Do many of you folks open your engine hatch when taking a break on
long-ish drives?  I do it out of habit, as I grew up watching my dad do
the same thing on the family beetle whenever we stopped for lunch or
restroom breaks.. My thought is that it can only help
with air flow and hence aid in heat exchange.
  Has anyone with the &quot;won't start when hot&quot; problem tried seeing if this
shortens the time it takes for the engine to crank normally again?

p.s.)  I'm doubtful about the ability for wooden clothespins to be
effective heat sinks for a rubber fuel line.
