We'd love to get a hold of one of these stools too!  We have a
1977 Westy with green/yellow plaid interior.  Let us know!

&gt; Hi Folks, I need the camping stool, that fits between the front seats, for
a
&gt; ' 78 Westy. The green plaid would be nice, but I'll take anything, as long
as
&gt; it's in good shape. Please, if you've got one that you want to sell,
p-mail
&gt; me and I'll send you a money order(including shipping to NC).
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Parker,( who has a Really Short wife, who really likes to sleep on the top
&gt; bunk!)
