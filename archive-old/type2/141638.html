Subject: Re: [T2] cooling flaps

Jenny,

First I must disagree on your comment about why you don't need a thermostat. 
Here is my &quot;definite information&quot;.
 Type 1 engine:
A trend to remove the flaps was proposed and a fad turned into a religion. 
This was when these engines where nearing the first need for major engine 
repair, they would over heat like made. So easy fix, just pull the flaps to 
get better air flow. Buzzzer... bad idea, this caused the engine to have to 
run cool for a long time after its morning start on the way across town. 
This spells engine wear. This adds insult to injury. I always recommend 
flaps and thermostat and preheat. Spend the money and time and do it right.
Spring is installed to keep flaps vertical i.e fully open.

Type 4:
The above is the same except, and this is a big except. The flaps need to be 
there for air to flow over the oil cooler and cylinder if you don't have it 
your engine is in big trouble.
Spring is installed again to keep flaps open. The right flap is easier to 
note in this position.

If you have any more questions or I transposed anything here email or call 
me.

The OZ has spoken. Now go and be good to your bus.

Subject: [T2] cooling flaps


&gt;I read lots of discussion about cooling flaps.  I have not seen
&gt; definite information.  I am
&gt; reassembling a vw engine, and I need to know where to place the spring
&gt; that keeps tension on the flaps.  I do not have a thermostat and I am
&gt; not planning on getting one.  I live in San Francisco and there is no
&gt; reason to have it...
&gt;
&gt; Which way does the spring pull the lever that attaches to the flaps?
&gt; I read that this is a &quot;fail safe&quot; system, and if the thermostat is
&gt; broken (or missing), the flaps get pulled to the &quot;safe&quot; position...
