Subject: Last Call For Free Bus

Last call. I have a 1981 yellow and white Vanagon. Engine has spun main 
bearing. Tranny is fine. Instrument cluster gone. Interior pretty trashy. 
Exterior not all that bad.

I've already called the metal recycler. If it's still here by the end of 
October it's going to the crusher.

If you want it, please come take it away.

I live in Indianapolis, IN. Will be happy to send photos.

Jim
