&gt; I had a similar problem with my '70 when I first got her on the road.   I
&gt; pulled the starter/solenoid cleaned all the connections with a wire brush
&gt; and WD 40, paying special attention to the ground strap from the starter to
&gt; the frame.  I also installed the hot start relay at the same time.
&gt;
&gt; When I had the starter out I checked the solenoid by running some jumper
&gt; cables from the battery to the + and body of the starter. (this is likely
&gt; NOT the best way to test it but I quickly found out that it worked).
&gt;
&gt; To prevent the corrosion from happening again, I gave all connections a nice
&gt; coating of Dilithium Grease which repels water while promoting conductivity.
&gt;
&gt; All this may seem like alot of work, but for the price of an afternoon, she
&gt; now cranks with the power of a thousand bulls.
&gt; Let us know how it goes.

Mark, Wade:
It's both, and the ignition switch, too. This is known as the hot start problem
(archives). Too much resistance  between the battery and the solenoid, one way
or another. Muir book tells about a Ford starter relay being used to fix it. I
did this once on my double cab. Some shop I took it to for a clutch took it off.
Bosch makes a kit that's not much money and fits rather nicer than the Ford
part. Ron, John, are you listening? A good plan and probably more reliable than
anything else. Still all the good maintance for electrical connections is a
really good idea, too.
