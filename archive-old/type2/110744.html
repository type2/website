&gt; 	I purchased a book called &quot;How to rebuild your air cooled Volkswagen

&gt; than pulling apart my heat tins or whatever they're called... can someone
&gt; tell me.. do ALL 1.8s have the cyl head temperature sensor holes? 

I'd have to go and look, but the book might be talking about the temp
sensor for the FI system that is placed right next to where the intake
runners connect to the head. Not sure if you could get a head temp
sensor (like for a gauge) to hook there.
