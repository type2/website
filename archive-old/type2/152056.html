&gt; Bently Schematic &quot;E&quot; (1971 Models) shows a brown wire going from D

&gt; and I've left my keys in the switch plenty of times. Where's it
&gt; supposed to be located anyway?

right, from starter, to buzzer, via door switches and then to ground.

starter key inserted, makes ground contact, but with door switches
(normally closed, push to open) open there is no circuit.  open door and
circuit is completed to ground,

your right probably not important but it is still a ground wire.

&gt; &gt; don't know exactly which wire you mean, but on the VW bus brown wires are
&gt; &gt; usually ground wires.
