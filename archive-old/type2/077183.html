Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question

Hey, hey, hey...

Don't beat yourself up.

We are all here to learn. I didn't reply to beat ya up.

I was going to do the same (wrap my pipes) until an old racer warned me of 
the potential damage it could/would do to the steel. It was just that I got 
excited b/c I knew something that I wanted to share with you. It does make 
power but it leads to periodical pipe replacement. I guess it just depends 
on what you use your vehicle for. I'm always lacking cash for replacement 
pipes or spares...

Just doing some armchair engine-neering here.

&gt;I am sorry I did not mean on the Air cooled VW scene. And Yes I did know that
&gt;it is not a new thing. I just said its  one of the &quot; latest things &quot;. I did
&gt;not say it was a good thing to do, it was just for information.  I am sorry I
&gt;quoted a radial tyre instead of a cross ply.  I really upset that I quoted a
&gt;ratio of about 80% instead of  about 82%. And I am becoming sorry I am on
&gt;this list. PS  I don&quot;t think all this talk of a nuclear powerd bus is a good
&gt;idea. But then again all power comes from the sun ( or so I was taught in
&gt;school ) you see millions of years ago the sun provided the energy that grew
&gt;the plants that eventualy became the gas you put in your VWs . And what is
&gt;the sun but a great big nuclear device burning away in space. If I have got
&gt;this wrong please do not reply. Mel


Have a good one man...

Chris in TN
