Hello List!

I am very happy with my bus, even in her crazy days. The other night coming 
back from fishing (17&quot; sea trout), i heard a loud hiss as i started the 
engine. It was late and i was far from home, so i just came back home 
without checking it out. Power-wise, the bus was ok, but the sound was 
there. A day later i started the bus and the hissing was there but this time 
the rev. were incredibly fast. i mean it wasn't idleling like before, it was 
very very fast.

Today, i checked it and the same thing, very very fast. i dont know what is 
going on. i know crazines is a common thing on living things, but what do 
you guys/gals think about her? what should i look for?

Any comments are very welcome, montaña will appreciate it.

thnx, luiszo
