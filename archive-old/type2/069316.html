Subject: Oil Temp Gauge &amp; Sender

Hi Bob - (and list people)

My dip-stick sender and gauge arrived from 'Volkswares' arrived this
morning - amazingly good service - only took 1 day to arrive!  Very
nicely packaged, everything there, including full instructions.

I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of the gauge itself - very
solid, and well made.

I'm going to fit it this weekend - any tips?

Thanks for the advice on this Bob, and others,

Jonathan.
