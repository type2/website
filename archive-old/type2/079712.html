Subject: Re: [T2] too much air (windshield washer)

Steve,

I have purchased the proper tubing from the local Vwflaps...they seem to
know which it is, and had it in stock.

The colars are a different proposition though..I used heat shrink
tubing...no leaks yet...

Cheers, dave

&gt; ROTFLMAO!!!!  and... I resemble that remark!
&gt; 
&gt; It has been a while since I did it, but you can re-aim the nozzles on a VW
&gt; washer system by inserting a fairly stiff sewing needle and moving them.
&gt; OK, it was more than 10 years ago on the '78, which was only 12 years old
&gt; at the time.  Who knows *how* frozen the nozzles on your bus are, but give
&gt; it a try.
&gt; 
&gt; On the hoses, I have had spectacularly bad luck finding metric hose here
&gt; in the colonies :-( I am told that fish tank air hose is good, but have
&gt; not tried it.  I tend to salvage good hose when I see it in yards,
&gt; especially the reinforciing collar pieces VW used.
