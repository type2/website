.  get an independent estimate for repairs.

.  ALSO get an independent estimate of the value of your van, this can be
as simple as gathering up a lot of ads for similar vans,  also unknown to
most of us there is a second value book everyone has heard of the &quot;blue
book&quot; but there is also a &quot;Green book&quot; which is for &quot;vintage and historic&quot;
vehicles.

when my 78 was clipped they wanted to total out my van, I refused to
accept that (remember it is just an &quot;OFFER&quot; and you do not have to accept
it, read the fine print in your policy) I went out and got the &quot;Green
Book&quot; from my local library and estimates for the repairs and then the
added modifications etc.  presented it to the insurance company, they paid
to have it fixed (over $2,300.00) I not only kept the van but it still has
full coverage insurance on it, from the same company!

don't get qyped
