Subject: Part needed, stub axle

Hi Gang...

I'm trying to help a friend get a real nice two seat off road car back
together, and I've run into a problem with a stub axle....he wants to
get into bussing next spring, and possibly travel with us to Everybus..

This street driven car has a bus tranny, and bus CV joints, but the
brakes are 914 rotors and hubs...a real nice setup..problem is, one of
the stub axles is bent enough to possibly be the cause of a fatigued
rotor, and outer bearing failure, and that's the reason he took it apart
to start with...

The bearings are beetle IRS, and when I dug out the two bus stub axles I
have, they're both too thick to fit through the beetle bearings...

So what do people think this stub is....my thought is Thing, but is 411,
and 914 1.7/1.8 the same...and does anyone have a spare thing axle I
could get my hands on?

On a different project, I'm also looking for a VGC drivers side 72-74
heater box...I have flapper valves and heater up pipes to trade...or buy
the heater box outright.

Thanks all...
