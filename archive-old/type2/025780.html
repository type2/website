Subject: Missing Messages in Digests

Volks,

Due to a configuration error that was solely my fault, messages posted to
either list between Friday evening and Monday midday were not included in
the digest editions of the lists. There is no practical way to distribute
the missing messages to people who didn't get them through the mail server.
If you want to read the messages you missed, you can read them through the
web reflectors:

    http://www.type2_dot_com/type2reflect

    http://www.type2_dot_com/vintagebusreflect

Sorry for the inconvenience,

--Hoop
