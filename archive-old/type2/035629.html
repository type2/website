Subject: Loud Noise

Does any one else's van make a loud &quot;pathump&quot; sound when you go over a
bump or hit a pot hole? Could it be my ball joints have gone bad?
When I was under the front of the bus this weekend I tried to find any
loose bolts or such, no luck everything seams to be tight.
Any Ideas?
Thanks
Meredith
