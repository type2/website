   I don't have a citation handy, Ken, but copying a whole book is
verboten. I know that most librarians would stop you if they saw you
standing at a copy machine trying to copy an entire book. You can copy
only parts, not the whole, and there have been lawsuits on how much of a
book is too much.
    In fact, in the library world, many are beginning to worry about
allowing *any* copying -- because some of the publishers are getting
very hard-nosed about it. Many publishers want *ALL* copying made
illegal. Some of our journals cost $10,000-14,000 per year each, so you
can imagine how lucrative copying could be. In fact we had an incident
at this library not too long ago where someone was coming in to make
copies and was then selling them to doctors, law offices, etc. Our
copiers now only work with prepaid cards, and you have to be a student
or faculty, or join a special group (for a hefty price) to use the
copiers -- and, believe me, the librarians keep a close watch on it. 
   One big arguement that has kept copiers in libraries so far is the
fear that people will rip out pages if they can't copy them. And this
does happen - I was a periodicals manager for awhile in a library in WI,
and the amount of missing pages was incredible - and they had plenty of
copier access, just too lazy or too cheap (at .05 per page!) to copy it.
I did a study to see which journals got vandalized most - it was medical
and education - the future nurses, doctors, and teachers.
