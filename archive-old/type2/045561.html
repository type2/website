Subject: Re: [T2] Colortune

The instructions for colourtune specifically tell you to test at idle and at
part throttle to ensure mixture is correct throughout the range. The
instructions are pretty good in explaining possible causes of rich/lean over
the speed range.   I used one on an old MG myself - can't remember if I used
it on the bus though as access to the plugs was pretty tight. I do remember
it had this plastic tube with a small mirror on the top so you could see it
the colour from difficult angles.

The device is essentially a spark plug with a clear ceramic piece enabling
you to see the combustion flame. Think of it as a cheap AFR meter.
I certainly got a lot of use out of it!
