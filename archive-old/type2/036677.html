Subject: Re: timing?

first the bus has to be completely tuned. 
1 valves
2 check/re-gap plugs
3 compression check
4 carb adjustment/rebuild
5 check points/condensor.  these are the minimum steps to do.

THEN you can check the timing.  as to moving it to different settings to see
what runs better...that is a great thing to do to experiment and find out
what runs the best for your bus.  a good combination of power/ease of
starting/and fuel economy should be your goal.

the above mentioned steps are not to be taken lightly.  you could spend all
day trying to time it correctly when your carb is way out of wack.  and no
matter how great a relationship you have with the bus GODS the engine can
still suffer back-firing problems when a simple carb rebuild or adjustment
could cure it.  proper diagnosis and repair is ONLY done by a systematic
(which saves time in the end) inspection of all related components.

have fun

&gt;  Hello,
&gt;  	I have set the timing on my engine to 7o BTDC and its
&gt;  seems to have a hard time starting and has mini backfires
&gt;  just when warming up. So I am thinking that the timing is just
&gt;  a bit to advanced which causes the hard starting and backfires.
&gt;  
&gt;  I have a 79 engine with a weber progressive carb, Stock dizzy 1 Vac.
&gt;  
&gt;  After reading muirs book and the library most say that the timing
&gt;  is either going to be set to 7.5o BTDC or 5o ATDC depending on the
&gt;  engine setup so on. From what I read it seems the two timing settings
&gt;  I mentioned above were -ALL-?? that I should set it too and nothing
&gt;  in between.
&gt;  
&gt;  What I am wanting to know is would it be ok to retard it to
&gt;  say 5o BTDC to see if it helps? And if it does leave it.
&gt;  The PO had it set at 6 ATDC and it ran badly.
&gt;  
&gt;  I dont know if this has to do with the timing or not but if I give
&gt;  it some gas and then let of it makes a sortive tickly tick noise.
&gt;  I have hydraulic lifters could they need replacing? Oil pressure
&gt;  not building up in them and causing this I am thinking.
&gt;  Or is it something else?
&gt;
