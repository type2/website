&gt; what kind of tires/oil/shocks are best for a Bus... ?-)

The oil FARTs get really tiresome, but tires are different. I thought 
that Yokohamas were the most highly recommended tires, but last year,

several people mentioned how much more stable those tires were. So 
brands, availability, and sources of tires is worthy of a frequent and 
recurring thread. Load ratings aren't, though, and as for oil ...
