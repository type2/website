Subject: Re: [T2] Excellent tune up

I've set points using a business card for a feeler gauge in order to get 
home when I had a car whose rubbing block was wearing away and the points 
were closing up every 50 miles or so.

&gt;&gt;-Hey, what happened to point gap?  I set mine visually (not even a
&gt;feeler gauge) with a bright light and usually get 48 deg dwell!  So one
&gt;can manage with not even a feeler gauge!  If I'm right that your timing
&gt;mark is when points just close, then with some wire and a bulb, and
&gt;noting that the points are just a switch sending/breaking the primary
&gt;curcuit, one can connect the bulb within this and  then turn the crank
&gt;until light comes on and note where it goes off -will give you dwell-
&gt;Muir covers this.
