Subject: Re: [T2] The bus camp out in the Rockies

Hi Troy,

You can serve the breakfast, you just need a permit. I'll make sure  
someone from the FMBC gets the paperwork out to you ASAP.  The more  
openminded bus campouts, the better!!

&gt; Sorry, no official name has been applied yet.  But you can vote if  
&gt; you like.  Check out the details at http://calivw78_dot_com/wordpress/? 
&gt; page_id=27 .  Its the weekend of the 18th in May (For those who  
&gt; don't want to click on a link.) No special events etc have been  
&gt; planned yet.  Is it legal to provide a breakfast  on Saturday  
&gt; morning without the FMBC in attendance?  In any case, I'm open to  
&gt; thoughts or ideas.
&gt;
&gt; Peace, Troy
