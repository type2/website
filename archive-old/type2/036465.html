Pat,
I have had KYB's on my bus for 5 years and love them.  Mine have not failed
yet and if they do they are guaranteed forever from where you bought them.

 I am leaning :) (sorry) toward the
&gt; KYB's but have heard of very short life span.  What is the general opinion
&gt; on the best shock for the loafs?
