Subject: Sticking a tap in a heater box

Hey, gang. I recently rebuilt my old 1800 into a 2 liter and in so doing
swapped out heater boxes from another bus. To get the old ones apart, I had
to cut the arm that you adjust the alternator, and thence fan belt, on. It's
been way too long (I bet the bearings are suffering) and I need to swap in a
fresh arm. However, the heater boxes I put on don't seem to have a hole for
the bottom end of the damn thing.

So:

Where do I tap?
If I go tapping holes into the heater boxes, am I gonna get an exhaust leak?
Any suggestions for alternate methods?

Cheers,
Ian
