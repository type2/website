Anybody have an XM set-up? Know somebody who does? I'm just looking 
for your thoughts on these systems. I will be investing a bit of money into 
hooking up all my vehicles (including da' bus) with some bump in the next 
couple of months and I am trying to decide what to pick up. I was thinking 
of putting a basic head unit in each of my car with in-dash CD and a cradle 
for the XM thingy. Between that and the home unit I'm looking at investing 
like $250 more to have XM in both the cars and the house and I don't really 
think that's all that much.

Thoughts? Reviews?
