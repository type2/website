This is an idea that has been done very nicely, if more expensively, by
these people:

I have spoken to them about it, it looks similar to a meat thermometer, but
apparently is quite accurate.

Sure, you can't see it while driving, but it also has the benefit of not
needing any wiring or cutting of holes to install it. You can see why this
would be attractive to the vintage porsche crowd, as they don't want to
disturb an original car. It was designed originally for 356 engines, then
adapted for 912E and 914, so it works in a bus also.

Mainely Custom makes some very sweet items, the best one IMO is their engine
stand, which is a copy of the OG porsche one that bolts up to a garden
variety 'yankee iron' rolling engine stand.
