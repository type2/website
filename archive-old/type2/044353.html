&gt; I have a crack at the bottom of my water tank, in the threaded area where

&gt; the market either original equipment, or otherwise?

I have had good luck with JB-weld in sealing ABS water tanks.
Polyethelyne tanks can be welded by a properly equipped RV service place.
they can also supply replacements in a wide variety of sizes.
