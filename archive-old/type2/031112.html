Bob,

In your note below, you mention something about the original Auxillary
heaters that were available for buses, and I'd like to hear more about
this.

I just recently repaired my stock heater system (lots of trial and
error, and asking a lot of questions, and looking into the back end of a
lot of buses as a recent bus show).  Once I understood how it worked, it
made perfect sense.  It works pretty well, as stock heaters go, and will
defrost and defogg my front windshield, and although it doesn't give off
a lot of heat (no suprise there), it does make my bus more bareable to
drive now that the weather is getting colder.

My question is, how do these auxillary heaters work?  Can I install them
myself?  How much are they?  Where can I get one?

Thanks!

&gt; First, I'm a bit confused about some of the heater/exhaust system
&gt; 
&gt; I see reference in books and cataloges to something called a &quot;heat
&gt; exchanger&quot;. Now is this the metal peices that fit over the headers? Also I

yep

&gt; see the &quot;heater control boxes&quot; mentioned, are these supposed to go between
&gt; the metal peices and the hoses that go to the front of the bus?

also correct

&gt; All I have is one of the metal peices and about half of the hoses on each
&gt; side. If the metal peices are the heat exchangers, why are they so
&gt; expensive, and if not, what are they and what are the heat exchangers.

after you see how complex they are you will understand why they are so
bloody expensive... I think they were close to that expensive back in
the
70's when they were easy to find.

&gt; Also, if I leave that stuff off until I can aford to replace it down the
&gt; road somewhere, will it affect the temp of the engine much? Oh yeah, I have
&gt; a 1972 Bus. 

shouldn't have any effect on the temp of the engine as long as the rest
of
the cooling system is intact.  in fact for some models you can buy a &quot;J&quot;
pipe which totally replaces the heat exchanger with a straight header
pipe.

mine were about as bad as yours, so I totally removed the stock heat
system and put in an auxiliary heater that originally came from the type
IV sedan.  works great and gives me a lot more room in the rear and
lightens up the exhaust system by many lbs.

YMMV
Bob
