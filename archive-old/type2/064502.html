Hi Phil!

This stuff sounds interesting, let us know more.  It sounds like a
solution to the problem of how to rustproof places behind panels
where normal scraping and painting can't be done.

If anyone has other ideas for protecting spots like these, let's
hear them.  I think a lot of cars rust from the inside out and any
amount of undercoating is not going to help.

I wonder if this stuff is akin to the &quot;waxoyl&quot; that our Brit
friends sometimes talk about.
