&lt;&lt; Best magic act I've seen in years is watching all those after-market 
 supplier's making those kid's money disappear, selling them stuff that's 
 supposed to be GOOD for the engine when all it does is wear it out faster
 and 
 make it run worse.  
 
 American Magic.  
 
 That's having a President who doesn't know the difference between a blowjob 
 and a handshake.  
 
 Or killing 41,000 men, women and children a year with cars is okay whereas 
 killing them with guns is not.
 
 Or kids who get on the internet to ask:  &quot;My bus caught fire today.  Should
 I 
 put it out, or what?&quot;
 
 You really gotta smile  :-)

it has been rumored that mr hoover used to be on this list as well.  i am 
unfortunate to have signed on much too late as he had already said good-bye 
to the type II list.  today i am buying his sermons from the depot.  too bad 
there werent so many big headed people on this list,  he might have stayed 
around longer.
