By 'billowing' you mean the rolled up pop top canvas blows out like an air
bag?
If yes: my 77 did that. I went and got self stick weather strip, I think it
was 1/2&quot; x 1/2&quot;. I popped the top and laid it along the edge of the luggage
rack where the front edge of the pop top sits.
No more billowing.




&gt; &gt;Sorry, my previous post about the metal screw pop top hinges apply
&gt; &gt;only to the early pop tops.  Obviously not to the ones with the huge
&gt; &gt;latch in the front center of the poptop.
&gt;
&gt; I have a '76 Westy and am experiencing the billowing. After reading
&gt; the posts this week about various tie-downs I went inside the van to
&gt; mull over it some more. What I ended up doing is wrapping some bungie
&gt; cords around the folding support, this had the effect of pulling the
&gt; top down snug against the seal.
&gt;
&gt; I am off to Los Anglees tomorrow and if the bungie cord works I will
&gt; post some pictures.
