Subject: moving to the coast

Hi everyone
I'm planning on moving to the coast and was wondering how this was going to
affect my 74 Westy.  What kind of changes am I going to have to make.  My
Westy has very little rust on it and is in very good shape so what do I do
to keep it that way?
Thanks a lot
TARA
