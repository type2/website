Subject: Re: [T2] Headrest front seats for my 70 bus?

Hi Ray,

IIRC there are no &quot;rails&quot; on the Pre-74 passenger seat. Just a set of  
slots that the base notches into.

Tonight's &quot;Franklin Night&quot;.... we're hoping to get the engine more or  
less done. Only thing we don't have ready to go is an exhaust; we're  
planning on using a bastardized 75-78 with the mufflers attached  
directly to the exhaust manifolds (no heater boxes, but we do have a  
BA-6 heater).

TTYL,

&lt;/Greg&gt;

&gt; I checked the archives and I'm somewhat convinced

&gt; wondering about the passenger seats.  Will they
&gt; fit my 70 as well?
