Subject: bus sighting

Hey all,
In the mail room at work, we have a big FedEx calendar/poster type thing (we have an exclusive contract with FedEx).  Looking at the pictures on there I noticed a familiar shape...

It's a late breadloaf type bus, a panel van, white with FedEx logo on sides and back.  Delivery man is standing behind it, one foot propped on the bumper, filling out a package slip.  Hazards are on.  I thought this was really cool when I saw it.  It must be a pretty recent photo as the logo on the side is the newer &quot;FedEx&quot; rather than the old Federal Express.  I'm thinking this must be in Mexico or Brazil somewhere.  The license plate on it was the same shape as ours here in the states.  Any ideas?

Sean
