I am also thinking of

Steve:
I think it's a bad plan to make any changes immediately before leaving on a
trip. I realize it's human nature to put off all that stuff till the night
before you leave, but, DO IT NOW!
At least the oil, if you're goin to synthetic.
I'd personally NOT go with synthetic unless you're running extremely high oil
temperatures.
What I would do is use straight weight 40 in a good brand. Think about it, on a
cross country trip, you might put on 400-600 miles without cooling down.
Multi-vis
pretty much always ends up being the lower number after a lot of miles.
Multi-vis is a lot better for short trips where the engine is cold very often.
Put the multi-vis back in when you get home.
