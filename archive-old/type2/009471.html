&gt; Good advice (and apparently the resistor block was the problem), but I
&gt; seem to remember that a 78 would run WITHOUT the AFM EVEN HOOKED UP!
&gt; (apparently it goes to some default settings or something). Am I
&gt; remembering this right?

Not in my experience!  If the AFM isn't hooked up, you won't get any
fuel pump!  I know this from personal experience. &lt;G&gt;
