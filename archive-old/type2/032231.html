Dear San Diego Area List Members:

I have not been able to get in touch with Mark Hineline for the last few
days.  I wanted to see if we could get together some local folks
interested in VWs to meet and talk about the same.  Now we have the
additional chance to go up to Pomona in a caravan and look around. Perhaps
we could combine the two?  Anyone interested?
