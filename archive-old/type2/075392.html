Subject: Re: head bolts

Head gaskets? . . What head gaskets? There should be no head gaskets. As for
the long bolts. . . You must mean the cylinder studs, they do not get
torqued at all, just snugged, but the nuts that hold the head on do get
torqued. Torque the head nuts when the engine is cool and only once. Over
torquing can pull the studs from the engine case when the cylinders heat up.

&gt;I will be replacing the head gaskets. Do the long head bolts need to 
&gt;be changed when this is done?  I know on some cars these bolts are
&gt;&quot;one time only&quot;  torquing.
