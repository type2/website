Subject: Re: [T2] Am I on the right track??

It was said:


&gt; This sounds like
&gt; an issue that will typically be resolved by just adequate maintenance
&gt; inspection. Rule that out before any further diagnosis.

Ummm. I'm not to sure how to respond to this without sounding like I'm
taking it too personally. I keep her maintained as well as I know how. But
this does bring up another question for a newbie like me. How often should
cap and rotor be replaced? (As often as they need it ).
