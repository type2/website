Subject: Current drain = brain drain

Wow, I bought the Radio Shack $29.99 digital multimeter that has amp 
readings of 40mA -&gt; 400mA, and 4A -&gt; 10A.

To determine that I did have a current drain, I put an old 30 Amp dial meter 
in line, and I saw slight needle movement.  Next, I put a 400mA dial meter 
in line and I got the needle pegged!!  OK, more than 400mA, but 
significantly less than 5 Amp.  I went searching for my 4 Amp dial [analog] 
meter, but could not find it, so I split with a handful of A Hamiltons and 
bought the Radio Shack digital multimeter.

I put that in line and got a reading of about .87 Amps.  Was this my current 
drain??

I have  a few test lights [single element 1157 tail light bulb in a socket] 
and I measured that bright light.  Pretty much 2+ Amps.  This put the 
current drain in perspective.

I have a second battery, deep cycle, and I have a few extra wires coming 
from the passenger side [PS] battery's positive terminal [my battery 
disconnect is in the PS battery negative ground terminal].  I was facing a 
daunting task!!

Was something crossing over from the deep cycle circuit that got connected 
when I added the new DC battery??  Did I accidentally turn the electric 
refrigerator on??  Were any circuits crossed, or bare wires shaken loose??

Nope.  I forgot to turn the radio off!!

OK, current drain = brain drain: solved.

But with a digital 4-10Amp digital millimeter, the world of electricity was 
just starting to open up to me.  I started to measure current flow.

Radio on [no sound] - .8 A
Door open/little overhead light on - .8 A
Parking lights on - 7A
Head lights on - O.L &gt; overload, over 10A. My 30A analog meter says about 
12A
High Beam Headlights [TBD]
Turn signal [fluxuates between .5 and .7  Don't know why...  Key needed to 
be left of for some measurements, and I didn't measure basic key on current 
draw]
One rear light [the test light] - 2A
