Subject: Need a little gel coat counsel

I9m restoring a badly nastied Westy top for my 80 Vanagon (it lived is rainy
western Oregon on a parted bus).  It was brown and green when I got it, now
its white thanks to some chlorox bleach and 1 coat of gel coat.  I have
white gel coat, and I found it went on pretty smoothly with a roller.  The
fiberglass is fuzzy, and very little of the original shiny stuff is left.
With enough coats of gel coat can it ever be smooth and shiny again?  Just
wondering if I9m doing this right.  It is still pretty textured after the
one coat.  I can live with it but I read something about wax? Is that what
gives the shine?
