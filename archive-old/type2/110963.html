Subject: 76 transporter hydraulic lifters?

i am puzzeled i have heard so much....
does a 76 transporter have hydraulic lifters on it..
this engine specifically has a 2ltr enigne and was transformed into a carb from fuel injection..

i have set it in time and it still wont ruin correctly and chugs to stay cranked...

i called a mechanic today and he says that the 76 has hydraulic lifters..
any thoughts on this anyone?

want to make sure..
he also says that to leave the valves alone....

says to also set the notch on the fan housing to the o on the timeing scale also and that is TDC....

says to hook the timing gun(strob) to #1 SPARK PLUG WIRE 
says to then hook the red clip for the gun to the left hand bottom side of the ignition coil and then says to hook the negative to the enigne.... or something that it can be grounded to..

confused about this adjusting valves thing... 
can someone shed some factual light on this before i mess soemthing up?
thanks so much
