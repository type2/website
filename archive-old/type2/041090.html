Subject: Re: piston wrist pin questions

Shelby Bell sends:

&gt; hey volks, i was parusing the archives and found some good tricks for removing
&gt; those pesky wrist pins, but i was wondering if anyone had any tips for
&gt; installing them instead of removing them.   will they go in easier since they
&gt; will be new pistons (ie. less buildup) or is there a trick to installing them
&gt; so i dont damage anything (road trip countdown coming)   lets hope my bus
&gt; depot order gets here by the weekend:) thanks everyone shelby 73 riviera

The first engine I rebuilt, I took a bad cylinder to a local tool rental
place and had them demonstrate a steel-cutting chopsaw to me by slicing the
cylinder in half lengthwise. Five bucks later, I had two cylinder halves,
both of which make dandy cradles for holding the pistons while installing
the wrist pins. (And three weeks later, when we built the extension on our
shop, I rented the saw from them.)

To install the wrist pins is very easy. Use mineral spirits to remove the
cosmolene from the wrist pin, apply a little motor oil (whatever you plan to
use in the engine is good for this) with a rag, and gently tap them in with
a rubber hammer. Occasionally you'll get one that the wrist pin will go in
with hand pressure, and I'd try that first.
