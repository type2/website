&gt;If you have to do any crimping go to the store and buy a good pair of cast 
&gt;iron crimpers - - - not the type that also strips the insulation and made 
&gt;out of recycled Chinese soup cans.

Even better, remove the plastic insulator from the crimp on terminal, strip 
the wire, slip a piece of heat shrink
tubing onto the wire, solder the wire inside the terminal, and shrink the 
tubing onto the connection with a
heat gun.  Sure, this takes a few more minutes, but the connection is now 
permanent.  I only wish Bob from England
had mentioned this before I'd done most of my wiring (I've gone back and 
re-done most of the connections properly).

I still carry crimp-on terminals, and an OLD pair of crimpers (like Chris 
recommends) in the tool kit for emergencies.
