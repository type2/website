Subject: Dog Day Weekend (kinda long)

Dog legs, that is. I made major progress this weekend on replacing the 
doglegs on my '76 Westy ( the area below the front doors, including the cab 
steps). Geez, what a job this is! On the passenger side, I only needed to 
replace the lower portion and the cab step. I had cut this side out last 
weekend, welded in the replacement piece Saturday ( typical, start welding 
and about 15 seconds into it the wire feed stops, out of wire, damn! ) The 
replacement panel I got from RMMW required about 2 hours worth of 
trimming/bending to get it fit right, and does not have the holes for the 
little rubber cab step mat. Anyway, that side is done, and it passed my tests 
( when I removed the clamps it didn't fall off, when I grab it and yank on it 
the whole van rocks,and I can stand on it!) My welding skills have improved, 
and a little filler is all that will be required to make it look good. Now, 
on to the drivers side. This side was a mess. The entire panel had to come 
out, from the seam below the back edge of the door all the way down to and 
including the cab step. This area was previously made up mostly of bondo. It 
took 7 hours to cut it all out! I also had to give up on the Dremel and buy 
an angle grinder, as the Dremel simply isn't up to the task, but still comes 
in handy for trimming in the tighter areas ( where the cab step meets the 
front clip). Both doors had to come off for this project, and I didn't think 
to tape up some plastic to keep the dust out, now the entire  interior of the 
camper ( as well as the garage) is covered with dust/dirt, so if anyone is 
considering a project like this you'll save yourself a lot of work by 
blocking off the interior.You willl also need to wear a dust mask, face/eye 
protection, and hearing protection ( I just shoved cotton in each ear) Also, 
be forewarned that the hard plastic vent line from the brake booster runs 
into this dogleg, into a pocket just below where the seat belt anchors-remove 
it before you start cutting! The replacement panel for this does not have the 
hole cut for the brake line, nor for the cab step mat either, but does appear 
to be of better quality than the partial piece I used on the passenger side.  
It, too, came from RMMW. I'm taking pictures of this whole process, hope to 
get them posted sometime soon.
