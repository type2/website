When I think back all the gallons of Sunoco 260 (100+ octane) I put into
cars in the early 70's... At least I can still remember!!

Maybe a good thread to start would be to recall our worst health/enviromental
situation that we have been in working around cars.

Here is mine:

I was an apprentice technician working at a VW dealership in the first year
that the watercooled rabbits + dashers etc. came out. The factory wheel covers
were a silver plastic disk that covered the whole wheel. After a few thousand
miles I lot of brake dust with good old asbestos would be waiting for us to
blow out when we rotated tires. I can remember great clouds of dark German
brake dust floating through the shop. I don't know how much of it has left me 
in the last 20 years.

Think healthly!

Jim
