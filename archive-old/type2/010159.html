Hi all,

Although not very Bus related, I thought I'd put out a request for info and
back-up support for an upcoming vintage VW trip we'll be taking towards the
end of next week.  My '55 Deluxe Sunroof Beetle (&quot;Martha&quot;) has recently
arrived back in Boston by container ship from Europe where we participated
in the Der Kafer Fahrer Club's &quot;Return to the Fatherland '99 Tour&quot;. 
Martha's safely tucked away at Bill Collin's place in New Hampshire
awaiting the final leg of her &quot;Tour&quot; back to St. Louis.  It looks like
Kathryn and I will be flying up to retreive &quot;Martha&quot; this next Wed, July
21st, and then we will start driving her back towards home on Thursday. 
Seeing as we'll both need to be home Sunday evening to go to work on
Monday, we won't have a lot of time for lots of sight-seeing.  But we'll
have the time to do a little back-road touring.   

We haven't planned the route yet, and were wondering if any of you in the
New England area could suggest a scenic yet fairly direct route form the
southern NH or Boston area southwest-ward  toward Ohio and on to Missouri. 
Please privately e-mail your suggestions to us!  Remember, we'll be in an
original condition '55 Beetle and fairly loaded down.  And unlike the
&quot;Tour&quot;, we'll have no one around for help in case we suffer a break-down. 
Of course, as the current President and a long time member of NEATO, as
well as LiMBO and the VVWCA, I'll be carrying along my NEATO/ LiMBO
Transporter Tourist and Travelers Directory just in case. 
&quot;Martha&quot;currently has a grand total of 60K miles on her odometer, and her
total &quot;Tour&quot; trip mileage from L.A. to New York, and from London through
Europe to Bad Camberg and back to London is 5,184 miles.  By the time we
get her back in the garage in St. Charles, MO she should have over 6,200
&quot;Tour&quot; miles under her belt.  This old car has been running beautifully,
and we don't expect any trouble, but it would be nice to know about a few
Vintage VW friends out there in the Northeast that we could call upon for
suggestions, directions and repair shops in case of trouble.  Again, e-mail
me privately if you'd be willing to be of some assistance, &quot;just in case&quot;,
or if you have any touring suggestions also.

We're looking forward to an uneventful journey as we wind down &quot;Martha's&quot;
last days on the DKF &quot;Return to the Fatherland '99 Tour&quot;.  Most everone
else's cars have finished, but our &quot;Martha&quot; is still not home in her garage
yet.  So she's still out on the &quot;Tour&quot;.

Wish us luck, as it'll be just the three of us out there, no back-ups!
