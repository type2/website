Subject: Weber 34 info ?

Greetings. I just picked up a set of Weber 34 ICT
carbs, and plan on putting them on my 74 Westy to
replace the Progressive Weber that is on there.

The Directions leave a little to be desired so I would
like to hear from anyone who is running, has ran or
knows about these carbs.

Things I am not sure about is how to hook up my vacuum
lines for the breaks and the distributor.
I am sure more questions will come up so I would
appreciate any and all info you can give.

Thanks,
Ed Maikranz
