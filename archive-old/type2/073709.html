different problems

&gt; OK, I looked through the archives, but could not find
&gt; the particular problem that I am having with my '73
&gt; Sunroof. 1700 engine, Holley double barrel progressive,
&gt; 009 (yes, I know, bad, bad things, but...) I recently
&gt; replaced the right head on the bus. This is the only
&gt; thing that I touched other than an all around valve
&gt; adjustment. I made no adjustments to the carb. I am
&gt; getting white smoke from the tailpipe while idling, but

hmmmmmm  have you checked your carbs?  I'm a fuel injected guy myself but
this I think is a sign of unburned gas....you firing on all cyl???

&gt; what's more scary is that when I stop the engine, the
&gt; smoke comes out of the fan housing. Also, when I step

how long since rebuild??  gas leaking somewhere???  something is burning
off of the engine and while running it is mixed with cooling air and
diluted so you don't see it

&gt; on the accelorator, the engine stalls briefly and then 
&gt; picks up. Any clues? 

the .009 classic symtom

More help will come from others I'm sure
