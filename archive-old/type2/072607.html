Subject: Kadrons and emissions test

I'm in the final stages of rebuilding a 1776 with dual Kadrons which I
inherited from the PO. I just got my notice that to reregister my car in VA
I must pass the emissions test.  I've read at least one post from a long
time ago to the effect that an engine with Kadrons never did pass and the
owner had to resort to dual Dells.

So my question:  Has anyone passed an emissions test with Kadrons?  If so,
was any rejetting needed?

Thanks Jack
