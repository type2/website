Subject: Some clutch questions:

Hi All:

I have some questions concerning the clutch on my 82 Vanagon (type IV
engine). As background I am in the process of rebuilding my type IV. I
was cleaning up the flywheels and pressure plates I have last night and
noticed the following:

- The flywheel that came off the van has some teeth that are worn and
hence my spare flywheel looks to be in better shape. How would I best
match my existing pressure plate to the spare flywheel?  How did VW set
the balance of these parts? I am sure that they did not spend the time
that a balance shop would.

- Any suggestion on how to check the balance of the pressure plate
against the flywheel so that they are in best alignment with tools found
around the home?

- If I have the surfaces of the pressure plate/flywheel redone, can I
just assume that the pressure plate is balanced and mount it in any
orientation with respect to the flywheel?

- What should I ask for when I have my shop resurface the
flywheel/pressure plate? They do not specialize in VWs and this is
probably the first VW flywheel he has seen since the late 80s.

- Lastly I noticed that my old flywheel has a metal ferrule that
supports the fiber washer that sits in the middle of the flywheel. The
replacement washer I have does not contain a metal ferrule. Neither does
the spare flywheel I have. Where can I find one as it looks like the old
one is damaged/worn?
