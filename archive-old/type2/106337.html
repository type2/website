Subject: FI fuel pumps/running out of gas

&gt;I think the real problem is with new cars. The fuel pump is submerged in
&gt;the tank and is cooled by the gas. Running it dry can kill the pump.

So TRUE!

BTDT, in Vegas, on the elevated freeway, in the summer! (it was an 88 golf)
What it really means, is that if you run the high-pressure FI fuel pump dry
once or twice, you never know when it is finally going to crap out--it will
run for a while and then leave you stranded, and cause you to miss a Dead
show.
