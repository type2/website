  I just changed my disk this year. Paid 63$ Can. (like 39 American) for =
just the disk.
Works great but now The Contraption (1700cc) engine is out again,and =
apart for a pair of rebuilt heads (Thanks Den), P&amp;C  (CIP) and a set of =
brand new heater boxes (Bus Depot).The flanges on the heater box to =
muffler joints were toast .I could have welded new flanges and ground =
smooth but the head to box joints always had a slight leak(especially =
#2) as well as shitty studs that pulled out of the head with spec torque =
when new! This is the main engine removal reason as on the way to =
EveryBus I encountered #3 exhaust valve seat sink. I'm not using AVP =
heads this time .Maybe I did get a &quot;bad&quot; head from them or maybe there =
is a cause to the problem(Vacuum leak or lean burning) but I'm hoping to =
be able to assemble this engine to be leak free.
    Also on my way home from EveryBus as I was only 5 miles from home =
pulling off the 4 lanners, I hit the brake and it was very hard . =
Obviously lost the brake booster servo. I'm wondering  since we had =
driven through rain and snow for 5 hours then cold and clear was it ice =
in the booster? I checked the hose (replaced last winter with new rad =
hose supported with a strong internal spring I installed, so I don't =
think it's the hose) . The next morning was warmer and the pedal felt =
normal again.=20
Wadda Ya Think?
