Subject: Re: [T2] Charcoal Filter??

Mike:
Because gasoline evaporates even when the engine is not running. The gasoline
vapors are stored in the activated carbon, then flushed into the air cleaner when
the engine is running. Simple enough.

&gt; what is the point of the charcoal filter anyways?  Why not send the
&gt; fumes directly into the intake?

&gt; &gt; Hiya Jason,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Your description of the function of the emissions (E-Can:  Emissions
&gt; &gt; Canister) system is basically correct.  However there is one very important
&gt; &gt; factor you overlooked.  This is NOT a passive system for trapping hydrocarbon
&gt; &gt; vapors.  Rather, the system actively draws off vapors from the tank via the
&gt; &gt; suction created by the cooling fan.  This is the reason for those hoses.
&gt; &gt; Whenever I am asked why the car smells like raw gas I look at the E-Can
&gt; &gt; system first.  In 99% of the cases it has been either removed or disabled.
&gt; &gt; If you remove the E-Can and its hoses you are asking for long term problems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Consider that the evaporation point (temperature) for gasoline is very low.
&gt; &gt; This accounts for the presence of hydrocarbon vapors in relatively low
&gt; &gt; ambient temperatures.  But just wait for a warm day!  The vapors given off by
&gt; &gt; your tank can rise to dangerously high levels.  Dangerous both in terms of
&gt; &gt; health (hydrocarbons are a known carcinogen) and fire risk.  Now if you rig
&gt; &gt; up some other way of eliminating these fumes from the passenger cabin (they
&gt; &gt; will get there) or the engine compartment without the use of the E-Can you
&gt; &gt; will be dumping a raw pollutant into the outside atmosphere.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Are you sure you want to go this route simply for the sake of eliminating a
&gt; &gt; couple of hoses?  And, for what it's worth, that E-Can should be replaced
&gt; &gt; every 40,000 miles.  Replacements are still available via your local VW
&gt; &gt; dealer.
