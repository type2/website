ok volks. 

after all the discussion about dino vs synthetic oil I had the opportunity
to do a test.   so the following are my results.

bus  -  78, fuel injected, stock setup, auto transmission, just rebuilt
mileage -  done with 2,800-3,200 miles on the engine
weather - 70-80F day, 30-40% relative Humidity
roads - Interstate 95 &amp; 83
altitude - 0-500 ft
speed - 65MPH
guages - VDO oil temp and presure guage, sump sender for temp
test prochedure - the temp and presure were taken at exactly 25 and 50
         miles after a cold start up, approx 5 miles on public streets,
         stop and go traffic.  run 1 &amp; 3 were done approx 10 AM  run 2 &amp; 4
         were done approx 2PM, done on sequential days.
(extra run 5 was done approx 7PM, run 5 was done because 4 was interupted
by traffic and road construction)

the lubricants,   
DINO OIL - Mobil 10W-40
SYNTHETIC - Penzoil Performax 100  5W-50
Purolator full flow oil filter, changed between DINO &amp; SYNTHETIC
fuel - SUNOCO 89 octane

DINO OIL           temp    presure           temp   presure

run 1              215       50               215     51
run 2              220       49               220     50

SYNTHETIC

run 3              215       51               215     50
run 4              220       50               210     45
run 5              205       50               215     50   



RESULTS - there appears to be no significant difference between the two
lubricants in my engine on this day.  in fact I noticed no difference in
any way between the two.
  I personally will stick with the Synthetic because in the winter it is
easier to start, and it seems to me to be less wear on the parts of
engines when they have run synthetic. 


BOTTOM LINE - I would say my short and limited test would lead me to
believe that the two behave very much the same way in a VW type 2, and
that other factors should weigh in on which one is used.

but as they say,  YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY
