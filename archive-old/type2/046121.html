Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] welding with a MIG

FCAW (flux core) always spatters more than mig. If the Polarity is set backwards, it
spatters hugely (and painfully.....). Check that first thing. Also make sure that
you don not have too much ventilation (a wind blowing the sheild away...) as that
will cause excessive spatter.

I got the MIG adapter for my Lincoln Weldpack 100 before I got all the way throught
my first spool of self shielding wire. I also use c25 and love it!!! MUCH better
than fcaw.

&gt;   The shielding gas isolates the weld from oxygen contamination and
&gt; also fluxes the parent metal.  I only get spatter when my shielding gas runs out
&gt; or I forget to turn it on.  So I would say your spatter problem is due to
&gt; insufficient fluxing/shielding of the weld, and it doesn't sound like you have
&gt; much control of that with flux core.
