Subject: Re: [T2] Engine rebuild

&gt;I just got my 78 back from Peek Performance in Lanham Maryland, and I am so
&gt; happy with the engine work and such.  I had 375,000 on the engine when it
&gt; died, and I expect to get more than that out of this one.

Wow - 375,000 miles?  That sounds like a lot.  My 78 has like 160,000 kms on 
it and still runs very strong - my mechanic wants to pull the motor and 
re-seal it and check the heads - he says it sounds like the exhaust valves 
on #3 are sticking a bit (this guy is like a 40 year German mechanic who had 
a shop in Frankfurt in the early 70s - he hears things I never will) - so 
he'll be doing that soon - I'd love to get that many miles on this motor.  I 
wonder what the record is for miles (or kms) on a motor. 375,000 miles is 
603,502.5 kms - wow!

How can you be sure that it is 375,000 mi? What kind of oil have you been 
using? Have you had the motor out and what have you done to it?
