Subject: reverse lights?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello again...well, I'm still waiting patiently for my new emergency 
flasher switch for my 75.  After some repairs last night, I moved the bus 
back to its usual resting place.  My better half told me the back up lights 
were not working.  ARGH, was my reply (which is happening more often than 
not these days) and I decided to go to bed.

So, are the reverse lights controlled by the same switch that I have 
ordered?  My turn signals had ceased to work after my painful heater cable 
replacement, so I have no idea if the back up lights stopped working at the 
same time.

If it is not the same switch, where should I begin to look?

I have an automatic transmission.

Thanks again!!
