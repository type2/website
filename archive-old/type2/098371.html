Subject: Re: [T2] Prepping Westy for paint

I was planning on pulling the windows, it's that the whole interior,
fridge and cabinets is a lot more work than a bug interior - I would
definitely pull the interior on a bug, or even a non-camper van. (your
bug looks great so far!).  

I do need to pull the fridge to get it going again, but all the rear
cabinets, overhead rear cabinet, etc,- look like a lot of work.  I'll
agree with anyone that says this is the way to go if you are serious,
it's just that I don't know if I should put this much work into the van
since I'm not too thrilled with the lack of hill climbing ability with
the air cooled Vanagon Westy - was thinking that I should get a H20 model
and possibly do an engine conversion at some time.

One thought I had, was pulling the windows and interior panels, but
masking off below what would be visible of the interior paint.  That way
I would not need to pull the entire interior.  No matter which way I
choose, my van is so ugly, that any methos will be a 1,000% improvement

I guess it comes down to time and money, if I had more of the first, I
would pull the interior, more of the second and I would have someone else
do all the work!

Thanks,

--SNIP=&gt; It depends upon what kind of job that you are going to do.
&gt; It's an 81, so the rubber is now 21+ years old.
&gt; You can mask,  to high heavens, but then there will always be the 
&gt; masking &gt; line where the tape met the metal.  I'm currently in the
process of 
&gt; working &gt; on two vehicles.  --SNIP---
