Subject: RE: [VB] Vintage Parts Score

  It's OK Dave I'm trailering my 15 window down there and I'm sure I'll hear
about it. It's just between all my swap stuff, 10 tranny cores and a few
crates of cranks and rods it would take me a full day to drive there and my
roof rack wouldn't hold it all.

ronnie

ps. I might even bring some cut off bus sheet metal and who knows what else

Ok, so, maybe I will/should trailer it for longer distance shows... like if
I could ever get it to Octo... and then, if I do, I'll have to get one of
those shirts that says:

'I trailered mine so F*CK OFF'


David


Ronnie thinks that I'll only drive it &quot;and on and off the trailer  :) &quot;
