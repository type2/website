Respond to me and I'll compile conclusion:

1.  How many of you folks illogically believe in original
instrumentation?
Of you, how many do so to be ALL original, how many do so on a
philosophical use of the engine as designed, and how many on the idea
that instrumentation is somewhat futile?

2.  How many of you folks are currently driving your bus in need of a
repair (backfire, missing, lack of power, loose heads, hard to start, or
in my case: loose steering)?  

Just thought that might be interesting to some of us, maybe not.

Thanks for replying,
Christopher - my response would be,
  illogically believes in original instrumentation on the philosophical
use of the engine as designed
  drives his bus in need of tightening the steering (and it's not
DANGEROUSLY loose yet)
