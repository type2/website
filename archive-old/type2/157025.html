Subject: free torsion arms

WHAT:
I have the 4 old arms with the old ball joints (and eccentric bushings
in the uppers) on them.  If anyone kinda local would like them so they
can press their own ball joints, I'd be happy to give these to you.  I
doubt anyone would want to pay for shipping on them, but its your dime.
 They are from a '72, so they have the larger lower shock mount
(fitting '70 thru '79).

WHY:
I recently replaced the torsion arms on my bus with a set from
bus-boys.  I didn't want to go through the timing hassle with a shop to
press new ones in while the bus was up on stands.  If you were going to
press new joints into your existing arms, this would let you get the
arms ready before you take your sled off the road.  I'd much rather
they get used in some way rather than go to the recycler.

PS: I'll have the pictures and write up of the job in a few days.  I
lost the cable to pull pix from my digital camera, so I'm waiting for a
replacement :(
