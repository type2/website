Subject: generator issues

on a 1971 1600 I am testing the generator because the PO put the battery 
cables on backwards and the red light is on, I switched the cables and put in 
a new starter, that was fried. so to test the voltage reg, it says to remove 
the b+51 wir but on mine there are 2 wires, should I remove both. I tried 
that just to see hooked up the tester started the bus with both wires away 
from each other and anything else, nothing reading on the gauge. I touched 
the ground from the tester to the ground on the generator and the positive to 
the red and white wire and the gauge went backwards. anybody knwo what gives 
thanks for the help. and it looks like evryone had fun at the EB maybe next 
year we will be there. Buffalo NY  Dyaln and Stephanie
