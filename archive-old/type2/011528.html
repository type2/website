Subject: airs list and parts place
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

All,
 Large yard in Seattle Washington for VW stuff is
Bry's Auto Wrecking
110 So. Kenyon St.
Seattle Wa 98108
206-938-3868
They say they ship also.

  I must say I am sick to hear of this young lady's
death!! Even though she had two dogs with her she still
fell victim to a determined sicko.
I have been meaning to sign up on the AIRs list but have
procrastinated.... This morning I input my information
to the list. Maybe, just maybe, I can help prevent
something
like this from happening to someone else!!

                Peace
