Subject: Buses by the Beach May 20-22!!

Everyone is welcome!

WWW.Busesbythebeach_dot_com

Show up Friday and kick off the weekend right with your Volks Friends.
Don't miss the big carabus Saturday morning from the Grand Rogue
Campground in Grand Rapids to the 5th  3rd Ballpark Burn Survivors Car
show.  We will be escorted by the Plainfiled Township Fire Department.
Back to the campground after the Burn Survivors Car Show for the
vaunted chili cook off and bus talk around the campfire.  Sunday, take
the opportunity to kayak or canoe down the Rogue River.

Buses By The Beach has rapidly become a spring and Fall VW destination
in the Midwest.  Our events last year were well attended and written
up in the August issue of Hot VW Magazine and on Limbo
(WWW.bcn_dot_net/~limbo). This year, we are very stoked about this:  The
Karmann Ghia Treffen Cruise And Herbie &amp; Friends Cruise Across America
group will be pulling into the Car Show and Auction to have lunch with
our group of Bus Pilots! 75 to 100 Karmann Ghias are expected in
Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Ghia.  Last year our buses
beat out the Mustang club for the most vehicles attending award.   All
our efforts and every dollar raised goes to the Phoenix Society for
Burn Survivors.  (http://www.phoenix-society_dot_org/)

See ya there!
