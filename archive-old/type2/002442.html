I guess I don't see the need for entire new tin for J-tubes, but it's your
bus.  Can't you just seal off the port holes that let the pressurized air
&gt;from the shroud through?

Anyway, if you're interested in plans for my engine dolley (2x construction,
four metal casters and some lag screws, with a routed flat piece that
cradles the sump) that allows for easy cooperation with a hydraulic jack,
I'd be glad to p-mail that to you.  Not as handy as a stand, to be sure, but
it's not bad, and easy to maneuver.
