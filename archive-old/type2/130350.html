Subject: Re: [T2] will this motor work???

Hello Mike  Yes it can be done  you will need to change everything from the 
heads out.  You will also need an adapter for the dipstick, empi or bugpack 
make them.  The flat motor wont fit so change it to an upright using everything 
from the old bus motor. later and have fun  mark dearing
