Subject: found something real neato

in the local flea market (flea market raises funds for the local animal 
shelter)

It is a BRAND NEW cassette player that goes into an 8-track.

Since we are quite the nostalgic group, and this would definetly be retro 
for our buss's... if anyone is interested in it, please send the amount you 
would pay (including shipping) and I will go and retrieve it (when I return 
from my vacation/schooling on 18 March 04).

UNDER THESE CONDITIONS:

1. It is for you and not to resell and make a mint (I can do that myself)

2. It would be &quot;proper&quot; in your time machine (because you are out-dated 
yourself !)

3. You always wanted one of these as a teen ager, but could never afford it

4. You still have the original 8 track in your bus ! (big bonus points here)

5. You want to upgrade to cassettes ! (hopefully lost)

6. You are still waiting for them to come out on the market with the 8 track 
to CD converter (really lost... and the search party returned to the control 
point)
