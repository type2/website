Subject: Web-Site revamp in it's final phase/need more bus-related site links

(Sorry about the bonehead re-send)

All,

I'm *fianlly* (hey, it's only been in the works for 3
months;-) in the last phase of re-vamping my '69 Westy
web-site!!! YAY! It will have something like 30
different thumbnailed jpgs/gifs and be a lot easier to
navigate (plus look a lot cooler, I hope!).

So, I need more URL's to bus-related sites for my
BusLinks page. These can be personal sites, or
whatever, as long as they are bus-related.

Please p-mail me any info.

I should have this done and up by the weekend and will
post the URL when I do.


Thanks.


Jaime
