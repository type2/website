Subject: Engine Stand(s) re; T2/4

A few folk asked if the engine stand notes I posted over the weekend will work
as easily with the larger T2/T4 1,7/1,8 and 2liter motors.....

Sure,  In your case you'll need to procur a transmission bellhousing from
a 68-80 bus. The model ID number on the tranny case half will end in either
a 010, or 002 respectively.

Although you &quot;can&quot; test the motor with the pressure plate and clutch disk
installed on the block, doing so using a T1 bellhousing will require you to
remove bellhousing material by grinding some of the reinforcing flange material
down as well as clearancing the upper and lower mounthole galleys which could
compromise some of the mount strength of the bellhousing case.

Also, with 74 and later fuel injection model buses you will need to utilize
the higher
pressure fuel injection fuel pump (80+ psi -vs- 3-5psi of the
stewart-warner) pump
I previously mentioned. In addition you will need to scavange a F.I.
harness from a
similiar model unless you removed yours from the ECU when you took out your
motor as well as the fuel lines and brainbox (ECU).

I would recomend using the heavier duty 4-wheeled &quot;U&quot; stand  as the T4 motors do
weigh a bit more than their T1 counterparts, and have greater mass
extending from
the center axis.

good luck
