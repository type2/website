Subject: RE: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

&gt; I am not sure if the situation is the same in the USA, but in
&gt; Canada, Bosch has a roadside assistance component to the
&gt; warranty. If the alternator should fail within the year
&gt; period, they pay for the tow, which is something anyhow.


Actually, they'll do this for 2 years (at least in the U.S.). Absolutely
brilliant marketing on their part! The guy who thought of it should get a
raise!  Since Bosch alternators and starters rarely fail within the first
couple of years, they risk very little. Most likely, after you get towed to
the repair shop they will discover (quite correctly) that the breakdown you
blamed on the warranted Bosch part was in fact due to something else
entirely (a relay, ignition switch, etc.). Now they no longer owe you a
single cent for the tow (since it wasn't caused by the warranted Bosch part)
- and hopefully the garage you got towed to will sell you some more Bosch
parts to fix the actual problem. As long as they're confident of the vast
majority of their units lasting two years out in the field (which they do),
this &quot;warranty&quot; can only be a profit-maker for them.
