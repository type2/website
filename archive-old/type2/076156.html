Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Swat

I say one squad scouts new bus material and then appears in three piece 
suits with paperwork that says the state/county/city/neighborhood 
association demands removal of said vehicle or face a $5K fine. Tell them 
they have to surrender the title as well as the bus will be donated to a 
charity. We'll call it RustingBus_dot_org. Maybe we could get a tax number and 
everything!!! &lt;Grin!&gt;

Other squad removes said vehicle and determines if it is a pile of parts or 
a good project.. Ummm. I wanna be on the second squad.... I need this clip, 
that bracket, those sun visors and one fluorescent fixture for my Westy to 
match to OEM one on the driver's side...

Any lawyers on this list. I might finally have a use for them... &lt;grin&gt;
