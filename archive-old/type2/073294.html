Well I logged in to post about a clunking sound coming from my '78 bus.

Started yesterday when I was pulling out of my garage. The bus felt like it
was glued down with one deep CLUNK. I thought it was water on the floor of
the garage frozen to the tire. No outstanding sounds all was happy in the
bus during the ride to work.

But then similar clunk when I left my parking space at the end of the day.
I was distracted and did not make much of it then. Bit of a clunking sound
during the drive home; faint and only lasted for a few blocks.

This mornings CLUNK could not bet ignored. Same feeling of a tire stuck to
the floor. Denise was driving and thinks it was the front right wheel. But
then it started to clunk, keeping time with our speed. Went around the
block and parked it in front of our house.

I will be opening it up tonight when I get home.

I will start looking for a loose brake caliper.

Anything else I should be looking for?

I also need to mention that I use my parking brake.
