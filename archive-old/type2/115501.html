Subject: 412 ENGINE IN A BUS

Guys,

The heat exchangers off the 412 will not work.............entirely different
heating system.....412 exchangers are really just took warm air and put it
through a heater booster that came standard on the car, and plus, whole
different setup that forced the air into the exchangers.........

You will have to lay both motors side by side and see what you need to
swap................
