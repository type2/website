Subject: [T2] Gen light acting different

 Hi folks;
  Wondering if anyone has ran into this?  
   69 Bus stock 1600 and stock generator setup.

    Started bus this morning,  ( no problems yesterday)  and Generator light 
is on solid. No flicker. When revving motor up, light gets BRIGHTER instead 
of dimmer. At idle, light is on steady, albeit relatively dim. Turning 
accessories on briefly have no apparent effect on light. 
    I've seen before where the light does the opposite on my bug, light is 
bright at idle, revving dims it- was time for brushes. But the light doing 
the opposite?  Hmm

   I replaced the battery with a new one today, as the old one was there when 
I got it, and who knows how old it was. Also replaced ground strap, and clamp 
on positive cable.  No effect on problem, but could use those items anyhow.  
New regulator about 2 months ago, too, but not a Bosch brand  : (
    Turning key off, light goes off as normal.
  Any direction appreciated
