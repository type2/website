Subject: Re: [T2] AFM adjustment of spring tension-how?

I've spent alot of time trying to figure out the whole AFM/ECU setup and
trying to get my bus in tune.  It's a major PITA and nobody ever seemed
to *really* have any answers as to how the thing worked.  Ultimately,
all you can do is loosen the spring to make it richer overall, or
tighten it to lean it out.  As far as a weakening spring.. who knows..

So instead of dealing with all of this ancient fuel injection, I got a
megasquirt EFI.  Cost me about $120, less than a rebuilt AFM, and I can
tune my entire EFI with a laptop.  It blows the l-jet out of the water
and is a breeze to tune compared to the l-jet's &quot;spring tuning.&quot;  I just
met a guy that is a factory l-jet serviceman that has tweaked those
l-jets past their normal limits by adding in pots and doing all sorts of
whacky stuff, but even he is going to switch over to a megasquirt on his
racing bikes due to the l-jet limitations.  I'd highly recommend looking
into it instead of spending alot of time trying to figure out how and
why the AFM is doing what it is.

Now, if you're going for all stock on your bus, then by all means,
ignore me ;)

&gt; Whoa- let's see if I get this-a given air volume (throttle opening
&gt; relative to gas pedal push) opens the flap in the afm against spring
&gt; tension....and the resistance read on the wiper arm by the &quot;brain&quot; tells
&gt; the injectors how much gas to give relative to the perceived air
&gt; volume.  So if the spring weakens over many years, it will let the flap
&gt; open FURTHER than normal, and the resistance is higher and the brain is
&gt; fooled into assuming you have a higher air flow than is reality- and
&gt; lets more gas through the injectors.
