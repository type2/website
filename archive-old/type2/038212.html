Sharon -

Just another thought...

Maybe #4 doesn't fire at idle, but does fire at just above idle. I'm no
ignition guru, so I don't know what could cause something like that.

Is it missing at idle, above idle, cruising, or pedal-to-the-medal?

Also, check for corrosion build-up in the dizzy on the rotor and (what the
heck do you call those) contacts on the cap.

Good luck!

&gt; It just has this annoying little miss that I
&gt; hear.
