Subject: Bleedin' brakes

Today I read the whole thread on this topic, and wanted to throw my .13 in.

The  same pressure brake bleeder mentioned at $39.95 is available for 
$28.50 from IPD, a sway bar and Volvo parts house in CA.

http://www.ipdusa_dot_com/

The bleeder shown on their site is a plastic vac pump.  The 
&quot;pressurized by the spare styl&quot;e is in their current catalog.  I have 
no experience with this company.  The Volvo community thinks of them 
*very* highly, they seem like the &quot;RMMW&quot; of Volvo.  There's a &quot;Bus 
Depot&quot; of Volvo  too. I recently picked up a '85  245Ti Volvo wagon, 
to provide a driver for the missus' while her 68 Riviera gets some 
much needed R&amp;R.

Brake bleeding:

I'm sure I have no more experience or knowledge than some others on 
the list.  This is FYI.  If I missed any posts/ points from the 
thread, please forgive me.

I've used all the methods mentioned in the thread save the tire 
pressure one mentioned above.  I imagine that it works OK.  It looks 
a little bit cheesy, though. I hope some one reports soon on the this 
solution.  In theory it looks good.


Pressure bleeder:

A professional pressure bleeder is the   *only*   way to go if one 
bleeds brakes very often at all. They are not cheap.  I picked one up 
for $20  at a yard sale  8^]  a few years back.  It takes about 15 
minutes of solo labor to completely change out the fluid in a car. 
It took about 30 minutes for my new Volvo, because I had to fab a 
master cylinder adapter and the car's got 8 bleeders.  You attach the 
hose and adapter plate, and bleed away.  The pressure on the supply 
can runs ~15 - 20 psi.
When it's this easy to change out the fluid, it can happen more 
often, to the mutual happiness of you and your bus

Stomp 'n squirt:

This works OK.  Can be messy, and there's the nasty possibility of 
damage to MC seals.  Cheap.  I've used this way too many times.

Vacuum pump:

This style served me well until I got a pressure bleeder.  As noted, 
it works poorly if the bleeder isn't removed first and greased up. 
*plumber tip o' the day*:  Instead of grease, use a small amount of 
teflon thread sealer tape on the shank of the bleeder.  Works very 
well, and it can be left on until next time.    The cheesy fluid trap 
included with these is junk - it's not to hard to fab a replacement. 
The metal  vacuum pump was my choice, and I still use it frequently 
for testing and sucking fluid out of various places.


I saw comments about potentially inducing leaks (air in/fluid out) 
using the vacuum system.  IMHO, if a wheel cylinder  or any brake 
part leaks that easily, it should be repaired or replaced.  Good 
brakes are not an option.

Getting off one's wallet for good tools is a personal decision.  I 
usually don't mind spending the bucks to go first cabin or damn 
close.  I probably would never have bought a power bleeder if I 
hadn't found mine on the cheap.  It sat on the shelf for three years 
before I cleaned it up and started using it.  I felt like a fool for 
not using it sooner.  Having used it 4 times now in the last year ( I 
do have a fleet)  I can tell you this:  If it broke or disappeared, I 
wouldn't hesitate to go out and spend $200 on another if that's what 
it takes to replace it.  It is one of my favorite pieces of shop 
equipment now.
