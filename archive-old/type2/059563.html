&gt;Mike G, did ya get there?

Yeah, I made it.  It was... interesting.  There were lots of beetles and
ghia and yes, some buses.  There were 8-10 loafs of various years/types
and 6-8 splittles.  Most of them had trees grown up around them so had
obviously been there for some time.  Nothing worth rescuing in my
opinion.  

I'm not sure what to report though.  Probably someone with a little more
'salvage sense' than me could probably have found some neat stuff.  I
just didn't know what I was looking at half the time since a lot of
parts had been removed and stored in some other part of the yard. 

There was a shack there that I called 'transmission hell'  It must have
had 100 trannies in it in various states of disassembly.  Who knows if
any of it was any good or not.  Same with engines.  Tons of engine
parts.  There was a type 3 completely filled to the roof with misc.
sheetmetal and shrouds.

My personal score was the ONLY pre-67 bus bumper in the yard.  Good
shape with nice overriders for $20.  Also snagged a 15&quot; early bus wheel
to use as a spare on Zorm.  Did manage to find a front rubber mat in
super nice shape in a 58.  Also got a type IV cooler, a few Hella red
side markers for my 73, an icerack for my Westy's icebox, and a few
misc. trim items.

The story on the place is that the land he's on has to be 100% cleared
by Summer 2000.  He'll probably have a rumage sale every few months.  He
did say that ANYthing left there by early 2000 would go to the crusher.
He's also got a huge storage barn out there (probably where all the
goodies are) that he didn't open up, but is planning to sometime next
year (probably after he weeds out the good stuff).

My personal opinion of the guy is not to good.  He's the same shop that
charged the previous owner of my 73 $1300 to replace the P&amp;C on the
motor that I ended up having to rebuild 7 months later.

Anyway, if anyone's got any specific questions about what was out there,
I'll try to answer them if you'll post to me off-list.
