Pat, et al here's how to make the pod shown on my bus at:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin

The pod is easy to make- take a thin plywood board or paneling and cut
it to fit within the recessed opening of the roofrack. Tack/power staple
1x1 pine (I used cut down 5/4 decking, pressure treated yellow pine)
around it to stiffen it.   Tack Masonite along one side , and then bend
it to form a half-round and tack it to the other side.  I allowed about
a 2&quot; overlap or extension beyond the bottom, cut to taper around the
roof rack shape.  Trace the inside curve of the bend onto more plywood
and cut a &quot;Mailbox&quot; door which swings via a piano hinge at the bottom.
I cut a &quot;stop&quot; for the door out of the same 1&quot; material, curved at the
top and screwed under the top curve.  You can also make a lock for this
out of a drawer lock from the hardware store.  Add a cabinet door knob,
paint it very well (masonite will swell and delaminate of too wet).
To fasted it to the rack, I  suggest you place eyebolts where the roof
rack fastener loops are, and tie or bolt it into place.  You could just
bungee it or strap it over the top.
