Subject: Re: [T2] kill switch placement ?


Hi Tom,
	I replaced my brake light(the small one on the dash) with a church-key 
electric switch, like vending machines use.  You can grab one at any local 
FLAPS.  Turn the key and no start.

	Eron
&gt;
&gt;Since I have my ignition ripped out of my bus, I thought this might be a 
&gt;good time to add a kill switch to prevent unwanted moving of said bus by 
&gt;unauthorized people.  Has anyone installed a kill switch that could lend 
&gt;some advice?
&gt;
