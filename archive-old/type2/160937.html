Subject: Cooling tin photos needed

As previously mentioned, I have a '77 bus with a '71 1600 DP engine. Nearly
all the cooling tin was severly kludged or missing entirely. I searched all
day yesterday trying to find a photo of bottom view of the cylinders showing
the installed cooling tins on the cylinders to no avail. The exploded parts
drawings I found just aren't doing it for me. I need to see them in place
for comparison. Does anyone know where the heck a good clear photo of the
lower cylinder tins in place on a 1600 can be found?

Thanks,
Ron
