&gt; Now for my dilemma. The cases are apart about 2.5&quot; and will not go back
&gt; together because one has &quot;fallen&quot; a few degrees out of rotation. Nor can I
&gt; find what is causing it to stay that way. I was able to twist the camshaft
&gt; out and drop the crankshaft *nearly* into its position in one case half.
&gt; However, the other case half will not rotate so that I can rejoin the cases
&gt; to get to the piston circlips. Note, the pistons are up inside the bores, so
&gt; the circlips are not reachable. Since I can't get the case back into
&gt; alignment, I can't withdraw the pistons... the whole rotating assembly is
&gt; locked except for maybe 5 degrees of rotation. Further, I can get only 3 of
&gt; the rod nuts off, so I can't remove the rods.

The case alignment may be easier if you can rotate
the crankshaft so that the rods are horizontal. This will
provide more room to play with the case, as they will
be at full extension. Until the crankshaft is free to rotate,
you will not be able to remove the pistons. You may
have to pull the case apart to the 3&quot;&quot;  clearance you
got previously.You may have also dropped some lifters
into the case, and maybe some cam bearings. ( use a pencil magnet ).
Find the washer that goes on the bottom of the dizzy drive shaft.
There is also a small coiled spring that belongs in the top end of it.
