Subject: RE: [T2] replacing sink pump and carpet/rust

There seems to be some kind of lag, cause I sent this message this morning.
We have since figured out how to replace the pump and now have a perfectly
working sink! (As well as some newly beautifully contac' papered shelves
underneath the sink!) The carpets are also freshly steam cleaned, and we are
looking at different carpet options...wool, glow in the dark(check it
out:www.ravecarpets_dot_com) or berber, to go over the carpeting already in the
car.

We just put the tire on the front of the bus and I think it would be cool to
get a tire cover with VW on it. I have only seen plain black ones.... anyone
have the hook up?

Our list of projects includes:
1. Insulate (by replacing crappy seals and adding better carpeting) and
clean the interior.... Can you machine-wash the plaid upholstery?
2. Exterior rust removal/paint. How in the heck do you remove the rust that
is on the upper back exterior on both sides beneath the vent? Also, has
anyone painted their own bus with good results? If not, how much have you
paid to get a good job done?

Thanks lots!
Cara

&gt; So replacing the sink pump in our 76 westy is a bit bigger project that we
&gt; thought. It looks like we will need to remove the whole cabinet
&gt; there to be able to connect all of the wires and put the pump back in.


This should be a ten minute job.  Just cut and splice into the existing
wires going to your old pump.
