Subject: [T2] Building an engine for sale

Hello List,

I just tore down a 1973 type 1 engine.  The case and crank are standard.  The
case will be machined 0.010 over, and the crank 0.010 / 0.010 under.  I have new
bus P&amp;Cs and two new dual port heads. It will be balanced, decked, cc'd, and
will have reduced compression (6.6-1.)  If anyone is interested, p-mail me and
we can discuss any modifications; displacement, stroke, full-flow, carb, etc.

Mike D.
