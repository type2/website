Chet,

I recently looked into the current options for bus tires. I thought that the
Yokohama Y365 load range C (1600 lb) was a great option considering
price/performance. You'll probably have to order them though.

$50 each at tirerack

www.tirerack_dot_com/tires/Spec.jsp?make=Yokohama&amp;model=Y356

(Hint - if searching for bus tires on internet sites, specify an 81 vanagon
rather than a 70's bus - you'll have better luck).
