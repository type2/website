Subject: Is this *BAD* customer service or what?

Hi to all

Not sure how many UK folks there are here but I have a cautionary 
tale to tell regarding Just Kampers.

First off I ordered some parts for my 72 bay and they delivered the 
wrong HT leads.  Secondly part of that order was wrongly delivered 
after I had specifically stated to the person taking the order that I 
wanted the parts to be delivered to my work address.  I paid £25 for 
delivery on Saturday and come Saturday I had put aside time to 
work on the van BUT some of the delivery was missing and didn't 
turn up till Tuesday so I couldn't get on with the job anyway despite 
having paid well over the odds for prompt delivery.  When I 
complained about the delivery being wrong and not on time I was 
initially fobbed off with excuses and had to phone back a second 
time to get a refund of the difference in delivery charge.

OK That was one order.

I needed some other bits for my van today and decided to give 
them another go.  At 2.50pm I ordered an Oil cap, 4 boots for the 
rear drive shafts and 4 sets of rocker cover gaskets.  I was told 
delivery of all parts would be by first class post and that the order 
would definitely leave by 4.00pm to be with me tomorrow.  I paid IN 
FULL by switch card and hung up the phone.  At 4.00pm I 
remembered the hash they had made of the first delivery address 
and decided to make sure they would deliver to my work address.  
First, I was told by the bloke that I spoke to that the order hadn't 
even been picked yet ie. too late to get in the post.  Then he told 
me that they didn't have any axle boots and that they were on back 
order !!!  I enquired as to whether they had taken the money for this 
order and surprise surprise they had deducted funds from my bank 
account as soon as the order had been made.

How they DARE take MY money from MY account having 
promised immediate despatch of goods that they DON'T HAVE is 
just unbelievable.  The order is about £50 and that money won't be 
back in my account for another few days as it takes longer to 
refund than it does to pay (???).  If I were skint I wouldn't be able to 
get the order filled elsewhere until that money were recredited to 
my account.

I am NEVER going to order from JK again and would advise all to 
be very wary about buying from them.

Cowboys or incompetents it doesn't matter.  BEWARE !!!
