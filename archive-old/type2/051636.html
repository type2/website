Subject: [T2] Welder opinion

I followed a topic a few weeks ago on welders. I was looking at the
sears gasless 80 amp mig welder. Any opinions on this welder? I have
never seen or used one myself.  It's main purpose will be to replace or
repair a few panels on my bus and for future tinkering. Anyone have one?

Bill
