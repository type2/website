Subject: Re: [T2] '73 or '72 to '71 rear brake conversion

&gt; Anyone know what it would take to put the rear
&gt; brakes off of a '73 or '72 and
&gt; put them onto a '71?

I tried once to put newer rear brakes on my 1971 model
panelvan. I looked at the system and decided not to do
it.

The thing is that on a 1971 model they used the old
type brake cylinder (1968-1971) and the new type of
drums (1971-1979). To make a 'bridge' between these
two items a special set of brake shoes were necessary,
hence the 1971 brakeshoes are 'one year only'!

I think the problem lies in the fitting of the brake
cylinder. With the old type of cylinder the 'screw
thread' (is this the right word?) is in the 'wheel
bearing housing'. The bolt that attaches the cylinder
goes in right underneath the cylinder. While on the
newer type of cylinder the 'screw-thread' is on the
cylinder itself. Therefore the screw is fixed in on
the back of the 'wheel bearing housing'.

Here are some pictures to make it clearer (man, this
microfiche site is good! ;-):

(watch how the bolt goes in, with the newer type it
goes in on the back)

I called the 'wheel bearing housing' (partnr. 12)

To fix newer brakes I think you need to make the hole
bigger in the wheel bearing housing so the
'screw-thread' disappears and the bolt can move freely
towards the thread in the cylinder. But I don't know
if this is a good idea...I decided just to stick to
the 1971-only system.

(I hope this message is understandable for you)
