Subject: Help - I'm obsessed

I think I'm becoming obsessed. I am without a bus, and I WANT one. 
Yesterday I drove up and down every street in my city (pop. 100,000) and
knocked on the door of every house with a bus in the driveway... and they
didn't even give me dirty looks!  I've made tons of new friends and
connections.. maybe once I get my bus I'll start a local type2 club.

Yvan.
