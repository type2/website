Subject: Re: [T2] electronic ignition

I just upgraded to the Crane electronic ignition, and after quite a few 
headaches, I *think* I have it setup correctly.

Right now my only big problem is bad gas milage. I thought it would get 
slightly better, or not better at all, but mine is about 3-5mpg worse than 
before.

I have no idea whats wrong, but im going to take it all back out and put it 
all back in again, try swapping out the AFM, distributor and double check 
the gap on my plugs and see if one of
those things helps.
