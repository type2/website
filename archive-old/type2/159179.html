Subject: Where is my engine?

No, I didn't lose it, I'm trying to figure out what's going on inside...

I can only get a quarter turn of the pulley before it springs back in either direction, tried it both counter and clockwise...

The range of movement begins with the rotor pointing at 4, timing mark out of site in lower left quadrant. It ends with the rotor pointing at 3 and
timing mark at about 32.

No hard stop - just springs back to the same point at either end of travel.

What's happening in there that can be hung up?  All plugs are out, as well as the #2 rockers.  #2 exhaust adjuster was dinged on one side, less than
1/4 of the total surface.  End of valve stems and all else looks fine on the 1-2 valve train, from what I can see.

Just had a bit of what sounded like odd clackety valve noise, other than that it seemed to run fine when I parked 'er to investigate the rattle. Now,
of course, I'm afraid to start 'er up. Well, couldn't if i wanted to, as I need to rotate the engine around to reinstall the rockers and set the lash.

Stock '79 CA FI.
