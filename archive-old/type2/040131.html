Subject: Re: Failing Brake Booster

Jed,
I just replaced my booster in my '68 dbl cab(71 front beam) for the second 
time in as many months.  The first one that I replaced was a used one and it 
lasted about two months before it went bad.  All I could find were 
replacements for about $225 on up.  I then ordered a freshly rebuilt one with 
a guarantee from Carparts_dot_com for $125.00.  Of course there is a core charge 
but they quickly credited me as soon as I sent in my old one.  Trust me I 
turned over many rocks looking for this deal.  Just spend the money once and 
cry once.

p.s.- stopping is just a little bit important...
