Subject: T4 push rod ID

I am disassembling a 2l T4 engine w/hydraulic lifters. One of the push rods
was chewed up (badly!) on the cam end.  I ordered a new one from Bus Depot
(071 109 301) but it doesn't look like the others.  The ones in the engine
have tapered ends while the new one has &quot;bulb&quot; ends.  I have no history on
this engine so I really don't know its condition, I'm just trying to get it
to run.  Could this engine have incorrect push rods or will the odd push rod
work OK with the others?
Alan
