Subject: Re: [T2] 75 Automatic Camper

Matty
Having owned nothing but Automatic's...here you go...check if it's an auto 
governed by vacuum or not...they changed in 75 from vacuum to mechanicl 
govenor (you want the mechanical...also a better trans).  As with any 
automatic, find out when they changed the filter and when they had all of the 
fluid evacuated and replaced (not just &quot;changed&quot;by removing the bottom 
pan)...check for any leaks while it is hot (does the fluid smell 
burnt)...drive it and see how the gears shift; smoothe, jerky, revving. This 
automatic is a good one, they used it 75 to 79 (later model Vanagens used the 
same but different linkage setup) If its solid, and working well, and you 
maintain it, it will help your engine last longer (cnt overrev) and is pretty 
trouble free.
Good Luck
and Aloha
