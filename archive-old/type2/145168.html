Subject: Re: [T2] removing dash

Yeah, glass is the first out, and the last in.
Makes sense, as far as glass safety, doesn't it?

Be careful, I cracked my windshield putting the seal on it out on the lawn.

Support those curved sides!

Do everything you can think of under-dash while that glass is out.

Billy


&gt; thanks that was the information I was looking for, so you pull the glass
&gt; first then do the work then put the dash back then the window??
&gt;
&gt; yes I was gonna use a protecter of some sort between the dash and the
&gt; welding to protect things.
