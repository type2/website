I beg to differ. Octane is octane. There are two methods
used to determine octane, research method and motor method.
If you can use a FTP site go to

ftp://rtfm.mit_dot_edu/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/rec/autos/tech/

Read a little, learn a lot.

Octane does not effect your mileage, only the life of your
engine.

&gt; Geez, next to oil preferences, this is probably the
&gt; oldest FART (Frequently-Annoying-Recurring-Thread;-)
&gt; around.
&gt; 
&gt; A quick check of the archives reveals that the
&gt; European method of measuring octane is different than
&gt; in the U.S., so the 91-RON rating on the inside of the
&gt; fuel cap is meaningless unless converted to U.S.
&gt; standards.
