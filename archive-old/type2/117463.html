&gt; well, i've been working in my little spare time taking
&gt; the stuff off of the old engine and putting it on my
&gt; running engine and when i went to take the plate that
&gt; bolts up to the torque converter off i noticed that it
&gt; had the triple square bolts on it like the cv's but
&gt; bigger, so, what size are these?

triple square, you mean the ones to the crankshaft right????

I thought they were the same size as the CV joints, but I just reach into
my tool box and see which one fits.....try the different sizes of metric
triple square til you get one that fits tight...a set that works with a
socket wrench is only a couple bucks at FLAPS

&gt; also, when i took the flywheel off of the good engine
&gt; i noticed what looked to be an inductive circuit of
&gt; some sort that plugs through the case right behind the
&gt; flywheel like something for measuring rpm's but it was
&gt; ruined.  i'm tempted to take it completely out but
&gt; then i'd have to plug the hole with something else so
&gt; i'll probably just leave it alone.

yeah that is a sensor for the old computer circuit, ignore it.
&gt; 
&gt; also, when taking off my carbs i noticed one engine
&gt; had a spacer between the manifolds and the heads and
&gt; the other didn't

??? should be a spacer
&gt; 
&gt; one engine had big bolts on either side of the head
&gt; just to the outside of where the manifolds bolt down
&gt; and my other engine only has one on the drivers
&gt; side????

?? not sure what ones you mean
