Fellow listee's

I (being the dummy that I am) purchased off of a certain auction site a =
disc of what was supposed to be a parts list for all VW vehicles from =
1949 to 2001. To my dismay, this CD does have good parts breakdowns, BUT =
when you click on certain parts they will come back as unknown of not =
available. SO my question is, is there anywhere on the net where you can =
buy/look at a TRUE parts list?
