Subject: my 68' round back...

Ok, just one question...  When I picked up my bus, the guy that had it
before I did blocked off the heater ports right at the engine.  He said
that it helps keep it cool.  Now, I may be stupid here for assuming
this, but if you block off the ports like that, wouldn't it overheat
more since there isn't anywhere for that hot air to go?  I mean doesn't
it need good circulation?  I don't think the guy was too knowledgeable
on it in the first place, cause there was an 6-volt generator hooked in
with a 12-volt voltage regulator.  Weird or what?
