I just happened to have an exhaust manifold here beside my desk. (getting

&gt; &gt; Mine in my stock 78 do *not* look stainless at all.  They look rusty and
&gt; &gt; my crossover pipe has a small hole in it.  There are a couple of places
&gt; &gt; where my exhaust mainfolds look as if they may have been rewelded
&gt; &gt; slightly.
&gt; 
&gt; Looks are deceiving.
&gt; The tin heat shield will rust. The crossover will rust.
&gt; The exhaust pipes will not. But the flanges on the ends will.
&gt; Get a magnet and check the 2 exhaust pipes coming off the heads and going to the
&gt; U pipes.
&gt; And the U pipes are stainless also. They have a tin shield on them also that
&gt; will rust.
