Subject: Re: [T2] Belly Pan Question

From: wes brown

&quot; I've got belly pans under my 77 and 78 westies
and both have no gas heaters. Didn't Westfalia use the
sunroof models? I know the late bay westies were cut
all the the back past the sunroof.&quot;

I know one 77 that you had that does not have one.

TravelOn,
