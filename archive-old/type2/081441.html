&gt; Hello Sherri,
&gt;
&gt; I've gone down this road (I put a '71 camper interior in a '73) and I can
&gt; offer you a few tips.  I'd second Rik's comments in general.  But
especially
&gt; about the icebox he's correct;  they're worthless, badly designed, etc.
But
&gt; I still have mine in the bus.  Why?  They've got a little flip-up table on
&gt; the door side that is so handy when camping, I put up with it the rest of
&gt; the time.  But, then, maybe I can mount that table behind the passenger
&gt; seat.... hmmm....
&gt;
&gt; Try Wally Mart for some off the rack curtains.  I (and you) probably could
&gt; learn to sew, but it was just easier to put something up that way.
&gt;
&gt; Look around for an older camper interior;  when the rest of the bus is
&gt; rusted beyond help, you can sometimes find someone (like I did) who will
&gt; sell you the whole thing for a hundred bucks or so (for &quot;parts&quot;) because
&gt; they are focused on the rusted-out front beam and are not thinking about
the
&gt; camper interior.  Then you can, as Rik says, pull out and use and
customize
&gt; it to whatever you want.  (&quot;Westfakia&quot;)
&gt;
&gt; The jump seat is Very Cool;  not for sitting on, but for the storage area
&gt; underneath and behind the back of the seat.
&gt;
&gt; I put the spare tire on the front of the bus;  the wheel well were it sat
is
&gt; a great storage area for tools,  jacks, etc.
&gt;
&gt; The second battery question has taken on the dimensions of a religious
&gt; argument (like tires and oil - see archives).  I had another car battery
&gt; around, so I wired it up, using the Hella relay from BusDepot.  I suppose
if
&gt; you have the money, a deep cycle battery is nice, but if I wait for
&gt; everything to be perfect before I get out and use the bus, I'll still be
in
&gt; my driveway.  8^)
&gt;
&gt; Welcome Buster!
&gt;
