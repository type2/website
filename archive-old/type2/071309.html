Subject: Re: Seats in a 72 Westy
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I just re-covered the seats in my 72 bus.  The first stage in the restoration 
process.  What a difference!  I stripped them down to the springs, fixed some 
of the broken ones, added the spring covering, lots of new padding and then 
the seat covers from TMI.  They look good, feel good and now the bus almost 
has a new car smell to it.  My first bus, my first restoration, what  a 
wonderful feeling.
