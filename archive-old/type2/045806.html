Subject: Re: [T2] Head / Brake Lights

&gt;We recently noticed that our 1978 Bus (pop top, chassis no. 2382074081, 2
&gt;litre engine CJ109108, Westfalia interior SO 73/7) has a novel feature - the
&gt;headlights come on as well as the brake lights when we apply the brakes.
&gt;I've been driving with the headlights on permanently so that people don't
&gt;think I am signalling to them all the time. Any ideas what I should look for
&gt;when I go to fix it?
&gt;
&gt;Secondly, is there any way I can tell if I have hydraulic valves without
&gt;opening up the engine? I've read that they were introduced in the 1978
&gt;models but don't know if my bus has the original engine.
&gt;

Jason,

I'm pretty sure only FI engines had hydraulic lifters, so even if your CJ
engine is a '78 or a '79, it will have solid ones.  If you have not
attempted a valve adjustment before and you don't know when it was last
done, now is the time to do it.  You should have 0.006&quot; valve clearance,
which indicates that you have solid lifters.  Hydraulics should be tight.
Another way to tell is to remove one of the pushrods.  In
hydraulic-equipped engines they are thin steel.  In solid-equipped engines
they are fat, hollow Al alloy.

&gt;And finally, the electric heater fan in the engine compartment has blown a
&gt;fuse twice. Does anyone have any experience where wires commonly rub bare
&gt;and short?
&gt;

Can't help with your electrical strangeness, sounds like you need to have a
good look at the wiring and check for shorts with a volt/ohm meter.  It's
possible that your lighting and fan problems are related, but don't ask me
how.
