Subject: Update on '78 Conundrum

Update on problem: Tried swapping in the following items from my '76 to
aid in the process of elimination; distributor with points, voltage
regulator, coil, AFC &quot;air box&quot;. None of these things improved the
condition at all. In fact, now I am unable to start the engine without
&quot;jumping&quot; the coil with the battery. I checked and cleaned all wires
leading to the starter solenoid. I then borrowed a multi-meter and
checked the voltage at the coil with: key on&gt; 11.5 v, cranking&gt; 0.0 v,
running after &quot;jumper&quot; 3.5v between positive and negative posts of the
coil.
Am I missing a ignition relay or something in my thinking here? And if
so could it be supplying insufficient voltage to cause the engine to
miss? Maybe the fuel injection is being affected by low voltage.
Your help is much appreciated!!!
