Subject: 70 Westy carcass in Sacramento

There is a '70 Westy in a local wrecking yard in Sacramento if anyone needs
anything. It's pretty pick over of usable bus parts but I wasn't looking for
Westy-specific parts and I think the fiberglass pop-top is intact. There was
also some sort of heater or something in a cabinet in the interior. I anyone
needs anything specific email me and I look for it next time I'm out there
or just let you know where to find it. I snagged the driver's seat, steering
wheel , wiper motor/linkage, and dashboard!
