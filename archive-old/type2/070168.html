i heard today that because of the shape of a beetle- rounded on top, flat on
bottom-  thus resembling a wing, at speeds in excess of 150MPH the beetle
would actually acheive lift-off  and FLY!!!!!  the friend who told me this
said it had been tested in wind tunnels (?), but we both laughed and said it
didn't matter, as they couldn't go that fast anyway.

so, did you see the beetle go 150 MPH, or did it just sit there?  and did you
see it start to lift off the ground?
