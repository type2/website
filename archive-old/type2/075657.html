	Subject: So Cal body/paint shops

	Anyone have any comments about either Convertible World in Signal
Hill, 
	California or ISP West in Carson, California?  I am getting
estimates from 
	each of them to restore my 72 bus.  Paint, some interior, seals,
rust etc.  
	They both seem OK, but just wanted to know if anyone has prior
knowledge or 
	experience with either of them.

ISP West uses too much Bondo for my tastes.  I've been there a number of
times with a friend that had his T34 done there so I've seen his and other
cars in various stages of completion.  Their finished product looks good but
they cover up their low level metal working and welding skills with bondo
making them a poor choice, in my book, for long a long lasting job.

Another friend of mine just got his '68 Type 1 Ghia done at a place called
The Shop on East Figueroa and we are both very pleased with the work that
was done and the price.  The car had a left rear quarter completely replaced
and the graft is invisible even from the inside.  And the rest of the body
work and paint are flawless.  They were originally recommended to my friend
by Koch.
