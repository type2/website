Subject: Re: [T2] SAPPHIRE XI radio's

My 72 411 Wagon has a Sapphire XI Radio in it. It
looks original. Not very loud either.
Thanks,
Tyler

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday I was able to pick up a really nice
&gt; SAPPHIRE XI AM radio from a 
&gt; local yard...   anyway, I had found this webpage
&gt; yesterday that listed all 
&gt; of the models and what year they went to, but cannot
&gt; locate it anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; It was great, you could see which one should have
&gt; gone with which model, but 
&gt; after searching and searching I could not locate it
&gt; anymore (dang, I knew I 
&gt; should have bookmarked the thing) - anyone know the
&gt; URL, or happen to know 
&gt; which year the SAPPHIRE XI went to?
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 76, and it definetly seems like it is an
&gt; older model year unit, but 
&gt; I don't know how much I am off by....
&gt; 
&gt; any tips would be appreciatted!
