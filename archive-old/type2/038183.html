Subject: re:79 heater boxes

I got my heater boxes and they are in real nice shape, original vw and 
everything.  My question is there are 2 holes on the top of the heater boxes 
near the exhaust flange, now I know you hook up the hoses from the fan 
thingy that sits uptop the engine compartment but do I hook the hoses 
directly to the heater boxes or am I missing some parts, I would thing they 
get to hot and would melt the hose.

Thanks Paul
