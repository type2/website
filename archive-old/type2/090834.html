What year?  From '71 down you don't have to jack at all.  From '72 up, I
think that you can get sufficient height by jacking with the stock jack
and putting 2X8s under the back tires.  If you can't get it high enough
with the jack on the ground, you can always put a couple of 2X8s under the
jack.  Make sure the 2x8s are wider than the height at which you are
supporting the jack bottom.  Otherwise it's dangerously tippy!
