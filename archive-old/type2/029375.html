&gt;my wife crank her over for me and a bunch of smoke came up from 
&gt;underneath. I
&gt;had her stop and I crawled under as quickly as possible. Feeling around on
&gt;every wire, but all were cool. Then I happened to touch the clutch cable 
&gt;tube.
&gt;Yowsa! That puppy was as hot as an electric eel. I could see that what was
&gt;happening was that the grease inside this was burning. 

If you have a rear supported engine, and your tranny ground
strap is disconnected or rusted through, the only
other good path to ground is your clutch cable.
Pump enough current through there and it will
get smoking hot.

Check your ground strap. I recently added an extra
ground strap on a friends Type 3 this weekend,
&gt;from the engine block to the body of the car, and
it smoothed out the idle as well. We had replaced the 
braided one from the tranny, but it had corroded up
in less than a year. The new one is up out of the road grime.

Cheerio!
