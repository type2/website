Subject: Re: [WetWesties] awning

sooooo, exactly how heavy are those jack stands that hold the poles down?
Do you think it would withstand a windy rainy stormy nite in the NW without 
blowing over.

I have  been thinking of getting an awning and this one looks pretty simple. 
I like the way it folds up into a bag.  and i'd probably use the jackstands 
for quickie set up instead of stakes and hammers.

I'm thinking I can easily sew sides onto it with lightweight  material.
