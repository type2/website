Hi Bob,

I think we have the same engine basically (Type IV
with FI?).  I can tell you my A/F mixture screw
doesn't really seem to do much, so I sometimes wonder
if my computer is actually doing anything.  Also my
engine is a little looser than yours since mine only
has a hot idle oil pressure around 7.5 psi in the
summer (hope to try another rebuild soon).  In
addition, the compression ratio on mine is too low for
my liking.  I only get 105 on most cylinders, and
don't get over 19 mpg on trips.  I used to get 125 to
135 on my old engine (except for one cylinder down
around 75), and would routinely get 23 mpg on level
terrain trips.  But what the heck I'm passing Va
emissions tests when I crank the idle up close to 1200
rpm.

Rob
