Missy,

You have the spool part of the seat belt retractor.  Is there a spring inside 
of it?  In any case, by your description, it is in pieces and I really don't 
know how to repair it.  You might be able to find a used one in a junkyard.

The black thing is a fuse holder, probably for the back-up lights.  It fits 
in a clip that is (might be) right above the coil on the fan housing of the 
engine.  One wire comes from the coil itself and the other wire goes through 
the firewall on the left and then to a switch on the left side of the 
transmission.  That switch is for turning the back-up lights on when you 
shift into reverse.

Hope this helps.

&quot; . . . at least I'm enjoying the ride&quot;
