Well, it's looking like i'm going to have two weeks off in June. the plan
is to head to Arizona by way of vegas. I'll be staying with friends in
central AZ, and possibly with some other friends in northern New Mexico.

While i'm out there, i'd like to get a camper. I'm looking for a '78 Westy,
but will consider older ones if they're in nice shape. Whatever it is, it's
gotta get me back to boston right away, and it can't have any rust on it. i
can get plenty of that up here...

When i was in AZ last fall, i noticed that there were a lot of used VW
dealers in Phoenix, Tempe, and Tucson. Of course, i failed to write down
thier names/numbers, because i had no idea i'd be coming out there again to
get a bus!. So, if anyone on the list who's in that area happens to have
the name[s] of reputable used VW dealers in Arizona, Northern New Mexico,
or near Las Vegas, please send me an email.

I'd actually prefer to get the bus from a private party, but i'm looking at
dealers only because i'm only out there for a short time, and they can
ususally get registration stuff taken care of right away.

thanks,

-perry
