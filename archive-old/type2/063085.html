&gt;Greetings 
&gt;Does anyone know the name of the VW graveyard that was 45 min or miles North 
&gt;East of Ames. Would that be near Cedar Rapids or Des Moines?

The place you're referring to is probably Services Diversified, a 
classy-sounding name for a semi-shady operation in Zearing,
about 25 miles or so NE of Ames.  

I don't know if the guy is still in business or not--he's beeing running
going out of business ads in the Des Moines Register classifieds
for well over a year and has been threatening to go out for a lot longer
than that.

He's got a lot of stuff--doesn't give it away by a long shot.  Anyway, take
the Roland exit off of I-35 and head east about 12-15 miles on the
county pavement.  In Zearing I think you turn right on Pearl St.  (There
aren't too many streets, so probably *any* right turn would do...)  

Be careful.  I've heard *many* horror stories about this guy, and he
once was trying to sell me a 67 from New Mexico which happened
to have no title.   Hmmmmm...
