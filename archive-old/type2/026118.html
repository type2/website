You will always get water coming past the scrapers, even new ones.  They
just don't seal the window properly.  That's what the drain holes are
for 8-)
If your vapour barrier is intact you shouldn't have too much water
coming in.  Are you sure it's not the door seals that are letting water
through?  I have some crappy seals that might as well not be there, they
will get replaced soon (moral - don't spend less than about 25 pounds
each on door seals).

&gt; hi all,
&gt; in an effort to discover why the cab keeps filling (not litterally)
&gt; with water
&gt; on rainy days, i have removed the trim panels.  Luckily it rained
&gt; today and
&gt; water came pouring into the cab from the various holes in the door.
&gt; The only
&gt; cause i can think of is the outer scrapers being perished.
&gt; 
&gt; Should the scrapers be preventing water ingression or is there a seal
&gt; somewhere below the level of the window frame i havent seen?  outer
&gt; scraper
&gt; sets seem pretty pricey so i hope its not the case. Any views?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks everyone
&gt;
