Richard:

And I doff my Bus-St*d hat to you sir!  I am not worthy... A mere &amp;
lowly spineless crustacean in your presence.

Bravo, everyone!  And a round of &quot;Huzzahs!&quot; for Richard on the count of
three.

Huzzah!  Huzzah!  Huzzah!

&gt;too, unless you want to constantly be d*cking around with your system.
&gt;Rip it all apart once - do it right, and fugeddaboutit (maybe)...

For those unfamiliar with what's under the dash I wrote up an article
about it 8 months ago:
