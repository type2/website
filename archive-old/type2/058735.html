&gt; Disclaimer: George -- Good point. Results are suspect. Speedos do read
&gt; differently (in George's case, a 75 mph reading on the speedo proved
to be
&gt; 62 mph). His method of checking calibration using a GPS unit sounds
neat.
&gt; Someone else mentioned employing fuzz radar. Another good idea, if
you're
&gt; chill with the law :-)

Actually, getting an idea of your actual speed isn't all that
difficult. You really don't need a $250 GPS to know your true speed,
though having one is certainly fun!  It's like having a trip odometer
that even works when you're hiking (and you don't get lost as long as
the batteries hold out!

OK, getting back to calibrating your speedometer.  You need a
straight, level stretch of road with mile-markers.  I-90 in Montana is
ideal, but any stretch of a few miles where you can easily hold
constant speed will do.

You also need a stopwatch and someone to operate it.  I do this by
myself, but only on _empty_ roads!  You may choose your own demise.

Drive along at the indicated speed that you want to calibrate.  As you
pass a mile marker, start the timing.  As you pass the next marker,
stop the timing.

Now divide 3600 by your time in seconds.  This is your true speed in
mph.  If you use a measured kilometer, your true speed will be in km/h.

Don't assume that the inaccuracy in your speedometer is linear.  If
you're 5mph off at 30mph, you'll probably be more than 10mph off at
60mph.  You have to make several runs to establish your speedo's
actual &quot;correction curve&quot;.

Happy Calibrating!
