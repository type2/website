Subject: Bus Boys

A week or so ago I took a slam at Bus Boys. Wayne called me personally 
and took care of the problem. Answered all the questions I had and is 
willing to give me credit on a defective part
apon return of it. Why the problem before I don't know?? However it is 
solved and the incorrect information on their web site is going to be 
corrected. Please don't turn this into any kind of thread
or flame war.I just wanted get the fact out. If you feel the need to 
respond please do so to just me.
