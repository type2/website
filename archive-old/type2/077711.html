If any addatuve reduced wear by 3%, it would come in the car from the
factory. They don't put it in there because the cost/benefit can't justify
it. And that's in the minds of engineers worth $100k+ per year, a whole
bunch of them. You will NEVER change their minds with a thousand
testamonials in a 60 min infomercial sales ploy trolling for fools.
