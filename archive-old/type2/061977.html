&gt; Christa and I have a Thetford porta-potti which we keep in a box behind 
&gt; the passenger seat...

Wow, just the thought of a diesel porta-potti would scare me away from
camping with you guys forever!

&gt;  And no, kids, no smell at all.
&gt;

Not even the normal diesel smell?

My number 3 son's child's seat rides atop the similar box in my '80 Westy.
I saw a real nice '92 Syncro Westy (the very last one) and it had a factory
option one of these arrangements -- matching upolstery and all.
