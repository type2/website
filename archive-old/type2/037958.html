Subject: Re: A very handy tool

I think the 2x6 upside down T is a very versatile tool.  I used a similar setup
(2x10 I think) as an engine stand when I rebuilt my engine, only I drilled 4
properly spaced holes straight down into the upright piece, to an exact
predetermined depth.
While my engine was sitting on top of my table saw I stripped it down and took
the heads, cylinders, rods, and pistons off.  Then I took the 2x10 T and slid
it over the shorter (upper) studs that hold the head on.  The longer studs
rested on the cross of the T.  In this way, the cross of the T was exactly
vertical when the engine was sitting upright.  I then rolled the engine on its
side and clamped the cross of the T to the table top.  It was a pretty stable
setup and saved me the expense of and engine stand.
