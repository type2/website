Subject: FREE! 70 Pop-top Westy in NH

Bussers:

My 70 Hardtop Westy is finished.  (OK, I'd rather drive it than tinker 
with it).  Therefore my &quot;organ donor&quot; 70 Pop-top Westy rustbucket has 
given me all I need.  I need the space in my barn more than an eventual 
part.  The top and canvas are in very decent condition.  Most locks, 
some glass assorted other stuff is still there.  Starter, trans, and 71 
axle beam, 5- 71+ wheels and tires etc.  1600 single port out but can be 
taken free if you take the bus, it ran when removed.  P-mail with any 
specific questions.  I only want to do this once so it's FREE, but no 
pick and choose.  Probably could be towed on its wheels.  Rear seat/bed 
is good but front seats aren't.  I'm offering it to the list first, 
before I call the local VW junkyard.
