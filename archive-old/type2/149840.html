&gt; and naturally for every bad one there is a PITA owner (me) that has

&gt; now I would say that I have been very pleased with the Pertronix.

Me too. 2.5 years with no problems. It seems the #1 problem people have is
that they wire up the coil incorrectly and blow it before they even get a
chance to try it out.

I pulled a failed Allison unit out of a Jag with pos. ground last summer. No
big deal but it goes to show nobody's perfect.
