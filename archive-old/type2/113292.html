Subject: Re: [T2] strange electrical woes...HELP PLEASE! free music
  offer included!

&gt; running for a while, it goes awayI drive off, but when I hit the brakes,
&gt; the flasher box clicks again, and the stereo dies! (power drain, but not so
&gt; much as to effect engine...)

Do you have a voltmeter? Get it started again and make sure you've got better
than 13V at the battery (charging).

How's your alternator belt tension? How are your grounds?

Take it to AutoZone and have them run their diagnostics on it. It may take a
few tries to get a tech how knows a battery from a starter, but they do have
better equipment and can test the alternator, battery and voltage regulator.

&gt; Until this morning at 4.00 am when I left for workit did the same thing! I
&gt; had to jump it and the flasher box went nuts till she warmed upso,
&gt; ?????!!!!!

By flasher box, do you mean your turn signal relay? Is there a flaky
connection in your warning light switch?

&gt; As I way of offering some return for favors granted, I would like to offer
&gt; to mail a couple of cds from my eclectic music collection to any who would
&gt; enjoy stuff like the grateful dead, the allman brothers, steve kimock, and
&gt; the many other jam-band, jazz, bluegrass, blues, folk, rock recordings I
&gt; have acquired through the years....

Just some kind thoughts the next time you see a bleau, blanc and rouge '74
pass by on the highway...

-Eric
