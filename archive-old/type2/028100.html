Brandy et al,

I had checked all the usual sources and either found the prices too high or NLA (no longer available).

Greg Schmidt wrote and mentioned that he'd gotten some not too long ago from Advance Auto. I checked into it, and sure enough, they can be had for only $35. Takes 3 days to get here from Atlanta, but that'll work!

Thanks all! Guess I need to learn to call the non-import parts stores too.

&gt;Howdy,

&gt;Are you saying you can not find and 71-72 calipers?  As recently as a year
&gt;ago I bought some calipers for my 72 from Schuck's (a generic FLAPS).  They
&gt;were pretty cheap (under $50 each I think), and worked fine....
