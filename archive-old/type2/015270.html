Hello All:
Well, as some of you know, I am about to start my third 
summer as a bus owner. The first summer I spent ripping
apart the '77 westy I had and fixing replacing all kinds
of things. Including installing a newly rebuilt AVP 2.0.
Thinking the whole time, soon as this is done I will have
a bus I can use for a daily driver and travel. Thanks to
the help of the list, in particular Mr. Karl von Salzen,
I got the '77 back together and running like a champ.

The next summer rolls around and I had plans to do some
traveling in my bus. BUT, like a fool, I had been scanning
the classifieds and saw an ad:
1979 VW PopTop Camper, one owner, runs and drives good, 
needs bodywork, asking $3000.
Now, I had no where  near $3000 to spend, had no intentions
of buying another bus. But, I was curious to see what a
$3000 bus looked like. I called the # and made an appointment
to go see the bus.I find the house and the bus. Meet the 
gentleman that owns it and we go out to have a look. 
It was obvious the bus had been sitting for quite awhile.
Turns out the &quot;bodywork&quot; he had mentioned was some rust
under the windshield, not too-too bad, but definitely in
need of attention. a few spots of surface rust here and
there, but it was showroom condition compared
to my '77 that was parked behind it in the driveway.
The PopTop canvas needs replacing and the top is needing
a painting  and new seal (which i bought for the 77 and
never got around to installing)

In talking with the owner, I discover that he bought it 
new from the VW dealer in 1979. He had used it off and on
during the 80's to take his family camping. He was living
in Canada at the time, which immediately gave me 'rust' 
concerns. However, he told me it was kept garaged during 
the winter. (which from the condition of the undercarriage
I believe) He moved to Alabama in '89 and drove the bus
down here then, since then it had only been started and
driven every couple of months, on short trips to the store
etc...

While my friend and I were taking it for a test drive,
he looks in the glovebox and finds the owners manual
and what appeared to be EVERY receipt from tires,oil
changes etc.... dating back to 1980. There was even 
a listing of the service, tuneup/oilchange/brakes/etc.
along with the date/mileage they were performed.
Engine had never been removed from the bus.

Being a Canadian Bus, the speedometer/odometer are
in Kilometers. odometer readin was at 81445.
Which equates to ~50,000 miles. no it hasn't rolled over:)
Driving the bus, I believe it, the steering and
suspension reminded me more of my t*y*t* than my '77.

btw- the last date/mileage in the service records
was 8/91 at 80332 (i think thats right).

So, I had now decided &quot;I WANT THIS BUS!&quot; Problem,
I couldnt afford it. So, time to haggle......
We shoot the breeze about this and that, talk about
my '77 and all the work I had put into it, etc...
Time to make an offer. I tell him I think $3000, is
way too much. As nice a condition as the bus is in,
it still needs a good bit of work before it would
be roadworthy. He says, make me an offer.
I tell him $15-1600 is about as high as I could go.
He says, &quot;well you seem to know/care a lot about these
busses and I would prefer it go to someone that will
take care of it and put it to good use. $1600 is ok.&quot;
(I *gulp*)
Then I have to tell him, well I dont have that much
cash to pay you right now. But, if you are willing
I could make payments and have it paid off in the
next few weeks. He says &quot;thats fine, if you want to
give me a deposit you can drive it home now.&quot;
( I *gulp* again)
we discuss details, two weeks later I went and picked
up my new bus.

Now, I had a '77  and a '79. I knew from the start I
couldnt afford two busses. Luckily a friend wanted
to buy my '77. I decided to pull my AVP engine from
the '77 and put it in the '79, and put the '79 engine
in the '77. (with only 50K on the original engine
it should be good, no? i even considered keeping it...)

Well, I *FINALLY* got the swap completed. Now I have
both busses running after the engine swap. However,
I am having some problems with the '79 w/ AVP engine
now.

I'm planning/hoping/dreaming(?) of taking my bus on
a 6000mile trip this summer..... But first, I need
to get the problems I am having solved. 

I'll save that for another post.

if you care to take a peek at my NEW bus:

Thanks for listening!
