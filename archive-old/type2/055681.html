While the old canvas/paraffin treated canvas will burn you have to realy
try to get them to go up.
While the new materials are &quot;flame retardent&quot; sparks from a campfire
will melt lotsa little holes in them,
and quickly I might add. The old canvas will discolor but they are less
likely to suffer real damage from 
small sparks landing on them.

found your shovel here!
