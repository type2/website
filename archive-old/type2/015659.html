&gt;I'll keep sitting for the few minutes it takes to let the engine

With all due respect, what do those guys know about VW engines?

In fact there are aftermarket items sold to deal with the
&gt;problems of coldstarting -- electric oil pumps which provide positive
&gt;oil pressure to the whole engine before you ever turn it over, for
&gt;instance, which are a very good idea. Also engine block heaters, oil
&gt;heaters, etc. which not only help get the beast started, but also
&gt;definitely add life to to the machine by warming up the metal *before*
&gt;any stress is placed on it.

Yes, those are good ideas, but not really relevant to the question of
whether it is better to let the engine warm up or drive away gently.  This
question is, I think, assuming that you don't have any of those fancy add-ons.

&gt;     A slower warm up is a plus, it allows a more gradual stressing of
&gt;parts. 

A slower warmup is a negative.  Cold oil increases wear.

Also don't forget here that we have engines which don't evenly
&gt;warm up, expand/contract, etc. at any time -- steel, magesium, and
&gt;aluminum all warm up and expand at very different rates.

Yes, but how important is that, really?  As long as the engine tolerances
don't go out of range, it's no problem.  And I don't think they do unless
the motor is overheated or dipped in liquid nitrogen.

&gt;     I don't respect VW's manuals in the slightest -- I had a brand new
&gt;'68 bus which was maintained by the dealer and had to have a valve job
&gt;done at less than 25,000 miles. Clearly their ideas on maintenance
&gt;scheduling sucked bigtime. And after I starting doing it myself, I
&gt;learned to totally ignore VW's nonsense. Warm it up, adjust those valves
&gt;every 1000 miles (solid lifters), check the timing and points then too,
&gt;and go no longer than 2000 miles between oil changes (non-filtered
&gt;engines).

For what it's worth (probably nothing) I drive my bus off after about 15
seconds of &quot;warming up&quot; unless it's below freezing outside, in which case I
wait a little longer.  My belief is that once the oil is circulating, most
of the potential for damage is gone, providing you don't have the wrong
weight oil for the conditions you're driving in.  What does bother me is
people turning the key and driving off before their oil pressure builds,
and revving the engine to redline while it's cold.
