Subject: Generator Testing Help

Is there a definative test I can do to tell if my 69 Bus Gen is bad ? (1600 sp
w/ 38v gen)
It seems to charge when the eng is started and then drop off to the point
where the engine seems to be running off the battery.
(Belt is tight. Tried a couple batteries all with the same result)
I assume but am not sure which direction the current flows - I beilieve it is
gen - volt reg- battery ( correct me if I am wrong )
I want to make sure of the culprit before I start replacing

Thanks
Eric
