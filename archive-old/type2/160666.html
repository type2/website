Subject: VW Bus Junk Yard recycling

OK, here goes...

I want to go to a junk yard and cut parts out of a donor VW bus (RBC).  I
figured I could take a Diehard Portable Power 950 with 18AH and run a line
from the DC outlet on the Portable Power 950 to a 1000W power inverter
(1000W = how many amps??  About 8-amps???) and then to a 4-amp 4 1/2&quot;
grinder with a metal cutoff wheel.

Have the picture yet??   Power 950 --&gt; wire --&gt; 1000W inverter ---&gt; plug
wire &amp; 4-amp grinder

Now, what concerns should I have about the wire between the Power 950 and
the 1000W inverter??  Does it have to be heavier than normal lamp cord wire
(18 AWG) and even like some electric dryer wire (8 AWG)


Heloise says:  I found some 1&quot; strap loops at my local hardware store.  They
are just $.79, but they are onle nickel plated.  Cheaper than chrome, and
$.79 X 8 = an affordable price.  A big True Value or ACE should have them,
not Home Depot or Lowes or even West Marine (West Marine's 'footman loops'
ARE chrome, pricey, and don't fit the holes in the fiberglass luggage rack.
One is too short, and another is too long.)
