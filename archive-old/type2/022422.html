Subject: Bosch Part # Help

Volks,
	I checked the archives and the library, but didn't find what I was looking 
for.
I've been going through brand-X voltage regulators at about one every 4 
months, so I finally broke down and paid twice what I did for the brand X 
ones and got a Bosch. Before I installed it, I started to do some research 
and found something interesting...
I bought the &quot;optional 70amp&quot; alternator to replace my &quot;normal 55amp&quot; one 
when I rebuilt my engine. I was under the impression that ALL T4 engines 
after 75 or 76 had the 70amp alternators, but I believe I am wrong. I 
looked in Bus Depot's catalog and they indeed list two different part 
numbers for the 55amp and 70amp voltage regulators. I've recently had 
negative experiences with them, so I went through a local Bosch parts 
supplier. This is my first time using him and I don't think he sold me the 
voltage regulator for the 70amp alternator. I asked him this and he swore 
up and down that it was the correct one, but before I put it in my bus, 
only to blow it in a few months, I want to check the part number to see if 
it really is the right one. Anyone out there know the correct Bosch part 
number for the late bay, T4 70amp voltage regulator? How about the one for 
the 55amp voltage regulator? Thanks,
Joel
