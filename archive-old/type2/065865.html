Subject: RE: busses, environmental degradation

&gt;Were the government really concerned about clean air they would pass
&gt;vehicles that run
&gt;clean and fail those that do not.  A failure should mean that the vehicle
&gt;can not be
&gt;registered until it is made to run clean.
&gt;
&gt;Under the present rules, modifications are illegal whether they actually
&gt;make the
&gt;vehicle run cleaner or not.  Logic would dictate that the tailpipe test
&gt;would be the
&gt;decider on passes or failures.

Note that this varies from state to state.  Here in NC, I believe, tailpipe
emissions are the basis for pass/fail (the more logical alternative).

I don't know, but I suspect at least part of the reasoning behind doing it
the seemingly illogical way is that it would be fairly easy to put in a
system which diluted the exhaust with ambient air, or dirverted the vehicle
exhaust in some insidious way.  Certainly this latter system would be much
cheaper and easier than maintaining the vehicles originally spec'd
pollution control equipment.
