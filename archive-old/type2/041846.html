Subject: silly question...

hi all,

I feel like a goof, but its been so long since i worked on an engine with
hydraulic lifters i have forgotten how to find TDC on #1...

My dizzy is off, and since the valves have 0 lash, i cant just feel when
they are both loose...

Any suggestions on a down and dirty way to find #1?  I think i remeber
using a pencil in the sparkplug hole as a trick, but isnt #1 at tdc 2
times during the stroke, how do i tell if im at the right top of the
stroke on a hydraulic motor...

thanks,

Steve
