Subject: Re: [T2] More looking at vans...

i gotta agree with Grant on this one.  if this van had only 50k overall
miles, why on earth would it need new heads?

&amp; DEFINITELY check on that &quot;intermittent clicking&quot;.  if you can't
determine what it is take that van to a mechanic who can before you buy it.

this may be a very good van for the price, but all that is really just
speculation until you verify what the owner has told you.

good luck.
