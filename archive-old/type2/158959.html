Subject: Re: Zero ohm distributor rotors

My point was (and I did have one) that the aftermarket rotors (other
than Bosch) are likely zero ohm, and therefore no effort, and only $5-7,
are involved to get one.

You can, of course, go the dremel route and INSTALL a resistor in one of
those to get it to spec ;-)

&gt;They are easy to modify.
&gt;Using a dremel with a mill end grind out epoxy and resistor.
&gt;Solder in wire.
&gt;Refill with epoxy.

&gt;there is a webpage somewhere with pictures and instuctions.

There is indeed!  :)
