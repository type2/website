Subject: Unofficial Everybus Shirts

Hey Folks, uncle 'Doom here, 
Those of you who went to Everybus last year may have
noticed, or even bought a shirt with a &quot;Red Cup&quot; logo
on it. The person selling them was me. 

Once again this year I am trying to sell some shirts
to help finance the trip down to North Carolina. 

You can view the shirts here:
http://www.busesofthecorn_dot_com/suburban/

The way we are working this is similar to previous
years, but I have changed some of the back-end to
avoid missed emails and streamline the whole process. 

This year I have two layouts, one on black, one on
green. 
The black shirt features the EB06 radio on the front
and the installation guide on the back. 
The green shirt features the Red Cup Ale bus on the
front, and a &quot;6 pack o' bus&quot; on the back. 

Both layouts are available in T or Hoodie. Sizes run
from Youth Medium all the way up to XXXL.

Prices:
Youth T's: $12
Adult T's: $17
Adult T's XXL &amp; XXXL: $20

Youth Hoodie: $25
Adult Hoodie: $30
Adult Hoodie XXL &amp; XXXL: $33

&quot;Girlie&quot; T's med-XL: $17

Prices are in canadian dollars.

How to order:
1. Go to http://www.busesofthecorn_dot_com/suburban/
2. Pick a design
3. Click &quot;order now&quot; which will launch an email to me.


In your email put the following info:

Name
Address
VALID email address
Your order
Ship or Pick-up
Your method of payment (mailed cheque or paypal)

How to GET your order:
You can pick up your shirt at Everybus
or
This year all items will be printed ahead of the event
by one week. That way, shirts can be shipped if
needed, in time for the event. 
Shipping is usually around $6
Or, we can arrange for another local event.

Please pmail me with any other concerns. Do not post
your order to the list! You can pmail me at
adoom_at_rogers . com (take out the spaces)

All orders must be in my hand and paid for by April
2nd at midnight. So that I can go to the printer on
the 3rd.

I appreciate you reading all the way to the bottom!
Thanks!

Adoom
