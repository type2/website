What I have used ( many, many,times) is a regular 1&amp;1/2&quot;  U shaped muffler
clamp.  I get them from Napa for about a buck apiece.  They straddle the
header pipe where it goes over the J tube that comes through the heat
exchanger.  You simply tighten them up just enough so that you don't crush
the ( pipe) j tube, and wahla, your exhaust leak problem, and backfiring are
eliminated!

&gt; &gt; You know those stupid exhaust flanges that keep on coming loose? Yeah,
&gt; &gt; those. The ones that are a bear to get to due to the rear engine mount.
They
&gt; &gt; can cause backfiring. Check and tighten.
&gt;
&gt; ive considered wrApping the joint in muffler tape and tightening the clamp
&gt; on that. I dont know if it would hold up any better.
