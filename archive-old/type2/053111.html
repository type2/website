&gt; &gt; Picked up two automatic transmission 1600 DP engines on Friday and was wondering if someone could tell me what it takes to set them up for a manual transmission.  Can I just remove the torque converters and install flywheels?  Any help would be appreciated.  I didn't see any info on this in the library.  
&gt; 
&gt; yes just remove the flex plate and put on a flywheel..the torque convrter
&gt; is a humungous thing bigger than a flywheel, and about 10 times heavier.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I'll buy the flex plate from you

You might also have a clearance problem if your bus uses the rear mount
(moustache bar).  The automatic transmission oil pump might interfere with
it.  Simple solution would be to switch to a normal oil pump.

Does your engine have the bosses for the rear mount?
