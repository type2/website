Subject: 74 westy Headrest

One thin that was omitted from the 74 Westy, I just purchased, was the
drivers seat headrest.
I asked the kid I got it from &quot; what happened to the headrest&quot;?
And the answer I got was, &quot;I dunno, Man&quot;
So with this in mind I am looking for a Orange headrest for it.
Anyone have one, or know where there might be one?

Thanks Much,
