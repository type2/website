Subject: Re: A/C into a 1971 Westfalia ??? (questions)

&gt;I've been curious about doing it to my '69 camper.  I was thinking of
&gt;using the compressor parts from a late '70s super beetle's ac, and making
&gt;a wooden blower unit from scratch to mount on the ceiling.

Don't know what the beetle had for A/C but I don't see why it wouldn't work.

&gt;I looked into mounting a camper ac on my roof in the rear cargo area, but
&gt;aparently those units are all 120volt.

Yep, and like another listmember mentioned, it's terrible to add that kind
of weight to the roof of a bus, not to mention the clearance problems.  I
wouldn't even consider a roof unit unless you have a hardtop bus, and
probably not even then.
&gt;
&gt;I would be very interested in hearing how your friend installed ac into
&gt;his '70 westy.

He didn't do it himself, but basically there was an under dash
evaporator/blower, hoses routed underneath the bus to a mid-chassis mounted
condensor with a forward scoop to pick up air (also a fan for idle
conditions), and a rear evap/blower unit where the shelf over the bed in a
Westy would be.  Very slick if you have back seat passengers.  The
compressor is the standard Sankyo rotary, a very good compressor from what
I've seen.  Mounted opposite the generator so the (longer) fan belt makes a
triangle.  Don't remember how the compressor was mounted.  He has a big
motor (1835?) in it so he can handle the extra drag.  Cooling?  Dunno, he
hasn't had any problems though.  He installed it after most of the hot
weather was over this year - we'll see how it holds up next year.  Same for
mine for that matter.  I've gotta get out there and take some pictures of
all of this.
