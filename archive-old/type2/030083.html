I've been using Rockford  boots since I got disgusted with the rapid
failure of Lobro and Qualitat &quot;OEM&quot; boots.  I have 3 years on a set and
they look very good with no cracking.  The Rockford boots are a modern
design made for much more twisting (as in FWD cars).  They do have a
quirk in that they are a bit shorter than the stock boots, so you have to
locate the axle end closer to the CV, not in the axle groove like the
stock boots.

their website is http://www.rockfordcv_dot_com

I buy mine at a local brake and axle outlet.

If the old boots are not letting dirt into the joint, then you are better
off not giving the CV a full solvent cleaning.  Just wipe the grease off
with a clean paper towel and add new grease.  Full cleaning causes the DV
to start up without full lubrication and may introduce grit into the
joint.

&gt; Last service was performed two years ago when I noticed that one of the
&gt; boots had cracks near the clamp on the axle,
&gt; The present boot is not leaking but I'm definately going to replace all
&gt; four boots.
&gt; I'd like to purchase a better quality boot for this go around if they are
&gt; available.
&gt; Anybody got a source for high quality CV boots?
&gt; In the past I've performed this service when the boots tore or cracked
&gt; and I've never had boots to last more than two years before they either
&gt; crack or tear.
