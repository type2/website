&gt;Just wondering if anyone had a source or would like to sell the tin needed
&gt;to convert to an upright engine in a pancake engine bus.

This is notoriously hard to get in the US but Just Kampers in the UK sells
it and they've gotten high marks from people who've bought from them.
Evidently they take credit cards and it's just like dealing with a US mail
order company except the shipping takes a little longer.
