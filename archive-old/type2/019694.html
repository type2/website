Subject: Re: [T2] FI stuff: Injector Testing &amp; Fuel Pressure Regulator Questions
References: &lt;39C40475.2CF03A91_at_panther.gsu_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; (1) Anyway, I want to know if anyone has injector testing options that
&gt; differ from what the Bentley offers.  I've been testing the injectors

What I did was setup a test fuel ring in the engine compartment.  I had
a line coming from the fuel pump to the left-side of the fuel ring (hose
extended to reach to the bumper) and then a hose going back to the
pressure regulator.  Then I  hooked up some wires to one injector at a
time (two on the ring) and turned on the ignition and the afm flap and
hit the power and watched the spray pattern into a glass cup.  I only 
had one that  was bad so I just stuck the injector in the hose backwards
so it would push all the dirt back out.  after that, it was fine.  I
tested the second one on the ring, then hooked up the other side of the
fuel ring and tested the other two in a similar manner.  Also, I used an
extra battery so that there was no arcing near the injector spray.

 
&gt; (2) My pressure regulator was reading high (40 psi) with my new Actron
&gt; branded pressure gauge, so I swapped in another, and it was the same,

Remember, you need to have the engine running to test the fuel
pressure.  When the car is running, fuel is being expelled which
slightly lowers the pressure.  I had the same results as you did.


&gt; high pressure problem (though I could be convinced otherwise).  However,
&gt; and here's the issue, with the two replacement pressure regulators, the
&gt; fuel ring was not holding pressure for more than a couple of seconds

Those two are probably bad.  Mine will hold pressure for approximately
30 minutes, maybe longer...  Also, you need to fire the injector under
pressure and then let it sit to see if it leaks.  It might not be until
it is fired that it starts leaking.


&gt; after I stopped operating the fuel pump, and after having reinstalled
&gt; the original pressure regulator, the fuel ring once again holds
&gt; pressure, and quite well.  What's the deal?  Presumably these things are

Use the original or buy a new one.


&gt; apparently been removed in the past.  I do have a couple of spare AFMs,
&gt; so I can swap in another for the retest -- but I figure I may as well
&gt; test the injector spray pattern as long as I have the ring laying on top
&gt; of the engine ready to make gas mist everywhere.

I am  in the same dillemma.  I  switched out an entire ecu/harness/afm
setup to test it out and then the mixture is even more rich on accel. 
I'm very  reluctant to touch theh wheel inside the AFM tho.  I did on my
other one and it messed everything up.  This one was  sealed tight, and
when I opened it, it looked clean, so Im not going to change anything
without testing the rest of the entire system.

ALSO CHANGE THE INJECTOR SEALS WHILE YOU  HAVE THE INJECTORS OUT!!!

and have a fire extiguisher handy for all of this!!!!

later,
MIke
