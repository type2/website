	I just got rear-ended at a railroad crossing. It's damage that I could fix myself pretty simply (bolting on a new bumper and the sheet metal in front of it and probably a new exhaust), but because I'm strapped for time these days and the Collider's insurance is picking up the tab, can anyone recommend a place either in Ballard or in the South End (I work in Kent). I'm squeamish about this. The only time I've ever paid anyone to work on the Beloved Beast they screwed it up.
