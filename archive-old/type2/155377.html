Subject: Re: [T2] plastic brake hose 76 bus

I have to chime in on this one.  The last sales job I had was working for an industrial hose distributor.  I even used to sell those big Teflon lined hoses that they use on tanker trucks that haul dangerous chemicals.  (I loved those sales because they were over $20 a foot.)  Any reputable hose supplier will be able to tell you exactly what chemicals are acceptable for a particular hose.  They keep track of MSDS's on chemicals and manufacturer's recommendations.   It's a big liability issue.  I know a truck driver who was is partially blind because he didn't listen to those recommendations.   Cheers....KR

&gt; Hey Chai!
&gt; While I don't know what the hose is made of, for these sorts of
&gt; things I always just call an industrial hose supplier and purchase
&gt; suitable hose by the foot.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know where you are geographically but down here in Tucson we
&gt; have a great industrial hose outfit called 'Granberry'.  They've had
&gt; every type of hose I've ever needed.
&gt;
yup I'm in Maryland and always get my hose from Langsdale Holtzman,. real
short lengths they will sometimes give you. especially if you buy a bunch
of other stuff from them.
