Kevin,

AFAIK they all have bushings. (Except the auto trans models which uses a self
supporting starter.)  The trick to get them out is a tap about 7/16&quot; (?) and a
matching bolt.  Tap the hole, stack up a few 1/2&quot;  washers or a 3/4&quot; pipe
nipple and insert and tighten the bolt.  It'll draw the old bushing out as you
tighten it up.  Having a trashed (or missing) bushing will cause the starter
to fail in short order.  Nothing to support the flywheel end of the armature. 
It floats around and drags against the field coils.  Drag means high current. 
High current means heat.  Heat means failure.
