Subject: 78 fuel gauge/dash questions

Can I successfully put the fuel gauge and the gen, oil, etc. lights from a
74 dash and put it in my 78? The 74 has no lights for &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;egr&quot;.

The main reason I'm considering this is the fuel gauge on the 78 isn't
working at all (no visible needle). I haven't tested to see where the
failure is yet, but I have the 74 laying around.

Also, where exactly is the &quot;button&quot; to push to turn off the egr light? I
felt around the back of the dash and couldn't feel anything like a button.

Thanks, as usual,
