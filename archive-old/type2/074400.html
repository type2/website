Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: AFM Tuning - Another Take

&gt; flapper vane and dead air space &quot;cushion&quot; behind it.  Something the
&gt; original poster might look into that is pretty far from FI but bears to this
&gt; is in the car stumbling or oscillations can actually be mechanical in
&gt; nature.  Poor motor mounts.  The engine shaking as clutch is released
&gt; even at speed can set up a vicious cycle that feeds on itself as can
&gt; odd road surfaces, even acceleration.  Anyway happened in my '81 until
&gt; I realized what was going on.

Road's perfectly flat, I might not even be accellerating, just going a
constant speed.

I think what I really need to do is have someone drive while I watch the
thing.  Then I guess I'll really know for sure what's happening.

But, if you have the spring tight, isn't that going to make the flap
more responsive, to air movements opposed to if it was loosened up.

The only analogy I can think of right now is an audio compressor.  Let's
say you have constant beats, you can either have a fast attack and
release time which will cause pumping, or you loosen things up (higher
release times) to allow the compressor to set an average level for all
the beats that are coming through.

What would cause those beats within the FI system would be another
issue.  I don't know if it's a resonant frequency within the drivetrain
that's causing it which is in-turn transferring into the engine by
slowing or speeding up the engine to pull more or less air to ultimately
affect the AFM, but I do know that loosening up the spring the first
time helped alleviate the problem quite a bit.

Would having a lean mixture cause this for some reason?

Mike
