&gt;         From what I have pieced together, the .009 was originally favored as
&gt;a &quot;performance upgrade&quot; by the racing crowd.

An article in a hotrod magazine many years ago said that the 009 was 
desireable because all of the advance was in at some ridiculously low rpm, 
like 1800 vs. much higher in the &quot;stock&quot; dizzys.  This was supposed to 
provide better throttle response and more power, which was one of the 
reasons I bought mine (along with perceived problems with my stock dizzy, 
the bargain price of $40 and the allure of having a shiny new part in my 
engine compartment).
