Subject: Re: [T2] A Friday Busaru Story (spotop)

There's lots of configurations that are working for
people. Mine has worked for 4 years and just recently
has had some problems. The biggest problem I have had
relates to selecting too big of a radiator in the
first place! I have had too much cooling. The story
was primarily about my bad weekend! Now my #2 vehicle
is being troublesome, so I've had to put Bussy back
together without any modifications. Next, get the
truck reliable again, then play with Bussy's cooling
system. BTW - not a heck of a lot of air comes through
there in a &quot;normal&quot; bus - they are primarily to
equalize pressure in the engine compartment - or so
I've been led to believe. I do know that people use
them for radiator airflow, so there must be something
there. -BaH

&gt; ya know i was wondering if two smaller motorcycle
 radiators mounted in the
 upper vents where air would normally come in ,one on
 each side.. would
 shorten the distance of the coolant travel and
 decrease the work load on the
 waterpump and increase the pressure so you wouldnt
 have to &quot;rev&quot; the engine
 to get the coolant lowing properly, think it may
 work??????
