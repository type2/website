Well, my latest trip was a bit more eventful than most!

Driving my stock '71 bus (upright engine, bus generator and regulator) 
&gt;from LA to Carson City, NV. Left home with the themometer sitting
at 113F!  Climbed the hill to Palmdale with lots of watercoolers dumping
their coolent on the pavement on the roadside.  Bus ran fine as always.

Fast forward to Bishop, CA.  Stopped for gas, and upon restart the
generator
light stayed on.  Checked belt, pushed on brush springs and wiggled
connections, no change. Revved engine up and light went out and stayed
out!  

Good, I just decided not to
shut things down until I got home, 160 miles away.  Got dark, turned
lights on, took voltage reading 13.2v.  So far so good.  10 miles south of
Walker, CA the gen light came on suddenly and brightly.  Checked belt and
wiggled connections again, no effect.  Revved engine again, no effect.
Drove on battery to Walker (barely made it) and called it a night.  Slept
in bus (first time I wished I had a Westy!)

Next morning, Dad brought me a fresh battery and I drove the remaining 50
miles to Carson City in daylight.  Voltage held steady at 12.6v,
indicating that I was getting a bit of charge.  At idle, battery dropped
to 12.5v.  Light is still on continuously, but isn't as intimidating in
the daytime :)

Unfortunately, the Bentley and Muir manuals are 400 miles away.  What is
the list_wisdom on this?  I was going to start with the regulator, but
does someone have a better idea?  Any tests to try?  I know that Bentley
had nice detailed tests, but I don't remember them (darn).

I have a job to do in eastern Nevada for today and tomorrow.  Luckily I
don't need the bus for that.  I'll check back in a day or so to see what
the almighty list comes up with!

Thanks, George Lyle
