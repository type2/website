Subject: Mannasas Bug Out Reservations.

I have reserved space 92 at the Bull Run Regional park (about ~4 mi from
the Bug-Out).  Any others interested in doing the same, the number is
(703) 631-0550.  For confirmed reservations you will need to pay 1 night
in advance (non-refundable) with a VISA or MC.  Depending on operability,
I will either be in the '73 (orange, black nose, blue/white pop-top
canvas) or the '76 White, non-pop top Westy).
