&gt;     I have a 1973 Type-2. I recently got a new exhuast system from

&gt; Depot. It has provisions on the side for an EGR tube. I was  
&gt; considering
&gt; whether or not it would be worth it to me to try to hook this up  
&gt; somehow, or
&gt; if I should just put a plate over it.

I cover them up at the exhaust and then take whatever steps are  
necessary to seal the intake where the EGR connects.

&gt; I don't even know where this would
&gt; connect... is it something that actually benefits in the cooling of  
&gt; the
&gt; engine?

I personally think they are no good for the engine. I don't like the  
lag the introduce just off idle when the EGR valve opens. I also  
think they make the engine run hot and the excess soot is a known oil  
pollutant among other things.
