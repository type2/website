Subject: Rubber seals

Hello everyone...
Greetings from Portugal

I need to get new rubber seals for almost all windows of my '68 bus. I'm
planning in get some from Clip1_dot_com (german seals) but maybe this doesn't make
sense, since i'm from Portugal.
Does anyone knows about a online store in Europe where i can get them and
other spareparts?

Thanks in advance

Joao Ribeiro
