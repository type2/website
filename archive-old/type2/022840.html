In a message dated 98-12-08 13:41:29 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; If anyone out there has a '77-'81 bus 
 with the airflow controlled fuel injection and has made the Tiger CDI 
 work on their rig, please let us know.  &gt;&gt;

I have one of these on my '77.  I didn't install it myself, but I'm pretty
sure that it did not require any modification.  I should add that the sucker
wouldn't start with the increased plug gap until we figured out that it was
shipped with the wiring harness plugged in backwards---off was actually on,
etc.  It's worked without incident for 18 months, but without any dramatic
results.  Bus sure runs nice, tho.  (Hi Bob).
