Subject: Re: [T2] most excellent fresh-air vent cover

Along the same lines, what do people do about the air intakes to keep snow
from accumulating in the engine bay while parked?  The last round of wintery
wonder left quite a bit of snow in there (always reminds me I need to order
that marine box for the battery).

Remember seeing previously on the list the use of duck tape (yuk) and a
magnetic furnace vent cover.  Any other clever ideas?

&gt; &gt; &gt; During one of the many desperate discussions on bus
&gt; &gt; &gt; heating, a list member passed along the tip to put a
&gt; &gt; &gt; strip of magnetic sign material over the front grill
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the bread loaf to block Ol' Man Winter's icy
&gt; &gt; &gt; fingers.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; A stroke of genius.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I stopped at one of those quick sign places and they
&gt; &gt; &gt; cut me a 5.5&quot;x36&quot; piece of gloss white magnetic
&gt; &gt; &gt; material and even rounded the corners for $13.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like it's a permanent modification. (My only
&gt; &gt; &gt; fear is some #$_at_&amp;!&amp;&amp;!&amp; will rip it off in a parking lot.)
