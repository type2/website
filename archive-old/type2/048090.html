&gt;
&gt; People have been saying that propane heaters give off moisture, well I
&gt; would like to see their data on that.

Any time you burn a hydrocarbon you get water, propane burns real clean only
gives off water and carbon dioxide, as long as it is pure and burns completely
here's the equation for the combustion of propane

c3h8 (propane) +5 (O2) (oxygen in air) = 4(H20) (water, aka moisture) + 3(CO2)
(carbon dioxide)  + HEAT(ahh toasty warm now, thank you chemistry!)

I use a propane heater in my bus also, I would think though that the additional
moisture in the winter wouldn't be a problem though because winter air is so
dry anyway i also have plastic behind all the paneling in my bus to keep
moisture of the interior metal, it also helps as insulation. I still haven't
found the ideal way to mount my heater though , its the cheap kind that screws
onto a small propane bottle, im thinking of buying some fittings so i can mount
the bottle externally. Any thoughts on this?
good luck staying warm!
