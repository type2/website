Subject: [T2] California/ federal vanagon hybrid??

&gt; I bought a 1981 California-spec Vanagon with a blown motor in need of a
&gt; serious overhaul.
&gt;
&gt; Took her down to the AirCare station, and failed again with NOx
&gt; emissions at 2300ppm (1900 allowed).
&gt;
&gt; The first of these seemed cheapest to address, so went out and bought a
&gt; timing light.  Had a look at the books, and got confused.
&gt; So, I know
&gt; mine's fuel injected.

Federal Vanagons were also fuel injected, so that doesn't mean anything, in
and of itself.

&gt; But thing is, while the sticker says it's a
&gt; California model, and the exhaust system looks like the pictures of the
&gt; california exhaust system in Haynes, Chilton also describes a hall
&gt; effect ignition replacing the conventional points in the distributor,
&gt; and an ignition stabilising unit as hallmarks of the California
&gt; version.  I haven't found anything that looks like the ignition
&gt; stabilising unit, and the distributor most definitely has points in it.

What makes a California Vanagon different from Federal?  Different ECU,
different AFM, different throttle body, different wiring harness, no
external resistor pack, Hall effect distributor and associated parts (ICU
and idle stabilizer), probably different decel valve (not too important),
different adjustment to EGR - both Federal and California had 'em - (and,
maybe, different EGR valve), different exhaust setup, O2 sensor on Cal, and
probably some differences I've forgotten.  You need to list out part numbers
for everything to see which way the majority of this stuff is going.

&gt; So, the questions, after that rather lengthy introduction:  What do I
&gt; have on my hands here?  Is it something that no longer bears any
&gt; resemblance to the way it shipped?    Would I be correct in assuming
&gt; that whatever it came as, it now has a conventional ignition system
&gt; which should be timed to 7.5BTDC?

The conventional wisdom is that you time to the distributor you have.
Determine that and you'll have your answer.

&gt; Is that likely to affect NOx emissions?  If it still fails once I've
&gt; decided what to time it to and then set that, should I be looking at
&gt; replacing the cat, installing an EGR system, both, something else,
&gt; spending much money for professional diagnostics?  Did this thing ship
&gt; with an EGR filter which has been removed by a previous owner? (There's
&gt; a dash on the board, and I can see where one would connect to the
&gt; exhaust stream and to the intake air distributor, but the filter itself
&gt; is not there and the connection points have plates sealing them...) Or
&gt; did it never have one, and shouldn't need one, despite obviously having
&gt; spots for it to hook up?

It had one.

You don't say where you're located, and under what jurisdiction you need to
pass smog.  Most smog guys aren't going to know the differences between
Federal and California, but typically there's a visual inspection involved
(in California) that could trip you up, e.g., O2 sensor installed? (Calif),
EGR in place? (Calif and Fed), catalytic converter installed? (Calif and
Fed), timing to spec? (Calif and Fed), and so forth.  If all you have to do
is pass some hurdles, irrespective of what *should* be there, then I'd say
time it to the distributor, install a new catalytic converter, and forget
about the EGR system which is damned hard to come by.
