Well, it's looking like you FI fans (I am one, really, except not of the
particuar one I had to deal with) were right.  I probably should have
shelled out for a reconditioned brain for my system in the hopes it'd fix
it.  I put a pair of used dual Weber 34 ICTs on, and the thing just won't
run right.  No matter what I do, the stupid thing backfires out the carbs
when it's held at any RPM above 2,000 or so.  (No load...I'm afraid of
breaking something if I try to drive it.)  I've taken off the manifolds,
sanded the flanges flat, and put them back on with great care, in the
theory that it might be a vacuum leak; synced the carbs; and blocked off
the brake booster hose.  No dice.  Still pops above 2,000.  Would I have
been better off going with a single progressive?  Lots of people seem to
have good luck with them.  Going back to FI may not be an option; I have
all the parts, but some of them are really in no condition to be re-used,
which is why I took it off in the first place.  Suggestions, anyone?  I
feel like a total idiot for not being able to figure this out.
