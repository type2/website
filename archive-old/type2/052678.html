Michael,

You have some good insite, but you mixed us some VERY critical facts.  You
addressed these to Steve, I presume you meant &quot;Stephen&quot; (me).

I was not selling, this was a FREE OFFER at my cost.  Just like the hosting
of the archives for the last 2 years, how much more proof do you need that
this isn't about money?!

Second, the reasons are to allow people to develop their own search
interfaces, at least two people have approached me to do so.  I also have
seen other reasons such as people on laptops where there is no Internet
access and their bus is broken down.  Think of it like the book you
reference.

Third, and this point is MOST IMPORTANT -- I did NOT publish it, I merely
SEEKED PERMISSION to publish it.  That is exactly what you said needs to be
done.   Have you seen this: http://vw.i405_dot_com/permission/

Now Steve, why offer to even sell the information on the
list, unless you can argue it's to help computerless persons- in which
case we can argue it was our sweat to create that list and we are
entitled to a cut of the profits, or see insurance that the monies go to
say, keeping the hardware working and recompense some time to the
administrators.  You really can't proceed to publication without getting
the permission of first, the owner(s) and then every contributor.
