Subject: '69 Clipper - Roof rack info wanted

Hi all,

Last month I bought this beautiful '69 nine-seater (The very same 'Clipper'
fotographed in 'The original VW bus').

It needed some attention: new heater boxes, tune up, front wheel alignment
and set of new front tyres. Had this done by my VW dealer (I supplied the
original VW heater boxes myself). Could have done some of it myself but had
little time and wanted it to get on the road. There's still more to do
however it is now a pleasure to drive. The 47 hp engine purrs happily and
really likes cruising at 50 to 60 mph although it will go up to 70 (120 kmh)
on the level. Braking is the weak point. The brakes do work as they should.
It's the lack of vacuum assist that makes you work just a bit harder and
sometimes gives you the feeling it's not up to the job.

The one thing to complete this nostalgic thing is a roof rack. Finding an
original would be very hard but I've seen new ones (by Westfalia ???)
advertised in VolksWorld. So here are my questions:

- Does anyone know something about these retro's ??
- Was this type of roofrack ever a factory or standard dealer option ??
- Who has pictures of an original roofrack ??

Please cc by pmail (I'm in digest).
