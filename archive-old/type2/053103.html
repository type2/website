Subject: Wiring on 71'

I have a problem with getting this new rebuild motor started.  It turns over 
like a charm but does not go varooooom.   I thought it was timing until i 
checked the sparks, and there was none.  The set up now looks like split 
black wire &gt;&gt; carb to carb on left.  White on L from electric box.  Black 
with fuse on L.  White/green on right.  Lt. green wire from condensor on R.  
Pale green to oil sensor on right.  Where was my mistake?  

Thanks, 
71 VW.
