Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint advice.

Anyone contemplating replacing their ball joints (and anyone with a 30+ year
old bus that hasn't looked at them lately) should spend a few minutes in the
Type2 Technical Articles Libary (www.type2_dot_com and click on &quot;Library&quot;).
Then scroll down and click on &quot;Ball Joints&quot; (or any of the hundreds of other
useful topics for that matter).  LOTS AND LOTS of good write-ups and
step-by-step instructions on how to fix almost anything on your bus here.

Thanks to the site admins (and the much-missed Josh Rodgers) for setting
setting up and maintaining the Technical Library!!!
