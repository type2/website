I found a 69 pop top Westy at a wrecking yard today. I removed the perfect
front headliner wood section. It did not appear to ever have been removed
before. There is a U channel spot welded to the roof on each side for the
edge of the wood to sit in. Jammed between the U and the roof was a 1950 10
pfennig coin!! I believe it was put in when the bus was assembled at
Westfalia Works.

About a month ago, I removed the rear facing single seat from a 69 Westy and
found 3 coins. French Francs, a 1, a 10, and a 20...all from the 50's but I
believe they fell out of someones pocket.
