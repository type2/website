Subject: Re: [T2] Air intake question

Woops...actually that would be the RECIRCULATION vent for the
Eberspacher....as in that vent pulled the already warmed air in the bus down
through a white plastic duct and back through the heater again. Really not
important to you, but wanted to get things right.

I said:
&quot;If so that is the vent where the warm air would come from if an Eberspacher
BN4 heater was in your bus at some point&quot;.
