Heat risers look good to me. No holes that I can see and the Carbon buildup 
that was at the flange area where the riser meets the muffler was cleaned when 
I installed the muffler. Funny thing is I didn't have any hesitation before and 
when the bus was slightly out of time and the bus idled at 1200 rpm's.
