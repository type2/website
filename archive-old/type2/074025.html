Subject: 009 distributor? Why not?

I've checked the archives on this (try typing in 009, NOTHING comes 
up). They didn't answer my question. I've been on this list long 
enough to HEAR that you shouldn't put them on a BUS because the power 
curve (or something like that) is all wrong, but I have never seen 
any tests and data on it. Can anyone point me in that direction?
The reason I'm asking is because last night I was leafing through a 
popular VW magazine and saw a 009 on a single cab pickup. I thought 
to myself &quot;If someone were to spend all that time and money restoring 
that pickup to perfect condition, why would they put that 009 on it? 
It doesn't enhance the performance. Don't they know that?&quot;
Am I missing something here?
Joel
