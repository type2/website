One of our other list members called this &quot;Parinoid Maintenance&quot;
I've got a spare engine I'm building but I'm going to put it in my
Westfalia before she *fails-u* and sell off the still good engine or
recycle another van by installing my useable engine.

Hopefully I'll have the desired compression and oil preasure I'm looking
for in the new engine and feel good about sending the older engine on her
way. Potentially a good Aircooled engine that is built properly will last
at least 100K and thats seven years of driving for me.

With the continued help of list members I'll most likley be able to hold
out for the right high quality parts.

I definately agree with one listmember who says to use the Viton seals
wherever you can throughout the engine.

There's no harm in storing a good standard crank in case you ever need
one  or even a complete balanced crank, rods, pistons and their matching
cylinders but the whole engine needs to be built fresh just before you're
going to use it.

If you've energetic and have all of the hard parts you're only 24 hours
away from having a fresh engine in your van.

I'm very guilty of  &quot;Parinoid Maintenance&quot; and have spare parts (mostly
used) for almost everything electrical, ignition, mechanical and even
door glass, mirrors, grills, bumpers etc.

I hit this cashe pretty hard when I rescue a van from the crusher but
almost always have plenty of parts to get the resurection accomplished.
My storage building is only 10x10 feet but the way its stacked in there
it would take a 10x10 feet building three stories tall if I wern't
willing to look for two hours to find a two dollar part.

So if you build a *premo* engine, stick that baby in your van and recycle
another van with your older parts.

If you come across some parts you'd like to trade let me know. The
freight is a killer on trades but I never find any 1970cc aircooled parts
in wrecking yards so I buy a whole van and murder it for my selfish
*Parinoid Maintenance* syndrome.

I'll send anybody a list of my spares that I'm willing to sell if they
are serious buyers. I'm not in the publishing business or the parts
business but I'm willing to help anyone that is willing to treat me
fairly.
