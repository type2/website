Subject: RE: why doesn't it work?

On the flip side of this, I took my wifes TDI today, and she was going to
drive the Jetta.  No go.  The jetta cranked once and quit.  She hopped in
the 78 bus that has sat since October, and it fired after about 1/2
revolution of the starter she said!.  Its been 0F here at night, so I am
pretty amazed!
