&gt;That's what I meant.  Perhaps I should have said

IMO you should always go with the proper dwell setting instead of the 
points setting if they don't agree.  This is because the dwell is a dynamic 
measurement while point gap is static, and dynamic measurements (engine 
running) are of course closer to actual running conditions.

&gt;Thanks again, David.  Your are hereby ordained

Thanks, but that title belongs to Karl.  I would be more like his 
teachers-assistant, like the guy who gives the lectures while Karl is 
responsible for giving the exams.  :-)
