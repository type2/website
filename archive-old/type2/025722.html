The thing that bothers me about this Bus is:

All of the time that the seller was wanting our friend to drop cash sight
unseen on this vehicle, it was perfect, original condition, a wonderful
investment. After it was made clear that no cash would trade hands prior to
inspection, all of these deficiencies start to appear.

Which leads me to one of two conclusions:

1) there's no bus there and there'd be no seller there either once the cash
changed hands. (Who knows if he's a lawyer? We're not face to face, I could
tell you I'm a lawyer. I'm no lawyer, BTW.) &quot;Disclosing&quot; all of these
defects is one way of keeping you from coming out to see this nonexistent
bus.

2) or there really is a bus, and there's even more wrong with it than he's
admitting. 

Passing this one by is probably the wisest choice.
