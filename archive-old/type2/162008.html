Subject: Deck Height of .120 Stock?

Greetings -

I'm finally finishing up the 1915 bus motor. Time for compression &amp;  
deck height!!

Deck Height: I put the CB Perf deck height tool on #1 with no  
gaskets, no nuthin', and I come up with .118&quot; (3mm / 25.4) deck. This  
does not please me. Is it normal for that much deck on basically  
stock components? I'm running a 69mm (Demello, from CB) crank, and  
Mahle 94mm P&amp;Cs from AC_dot_net, stock rods. The only thing I can think  
of is that they are &quot;B&quot; pistons? The box sez:

K70401 STD

so I'm a bit confused. I've always had the opposite problem - little  
or no deck.

Does anyone have the dimensions from top-of-piston to middle-of-pin  
for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; pistons?

Thanks -

Mike
