Subject: Vanagon_at_Lenti results

And the total is:

At least 66 current listmembers from V_at_L are still hanging out on one of 
the three lists and could be bothered to waste the electrons to reply.

Breakdown is:

Vintagebus  9
Type2      14
Vanagon    43 (counting me only once... I'm still on all three lists.)

The door prize is graciously supplied by early listmember 'Poor' Richard 
Palmer (currently answering from T2).  His message follows:


Poor Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt; sagely penned:

&gt; Since Spring of 1994!!!!!                                             
&gt; I did the original V_at_L shirts, and still have a ton of V_at_L stickers if
&gt; anyone is interested...free if they send a stamped envelope.          
&gt;                                    
&gt; These are the round ones. Make sure to send a #10 business envelope,  
&gt; as they won't fit in the smaller envelopes. If you want more than 3 or
&gt; 4, you might put on 2 stamps just to be safe. 

&gt; Please have them send self-addressed, stamped envelope (business
&gt; size) to                                                              
&gt; Richard Palmer                                                        
&gt; 121-C Park Ave                                                        
&gt; Raleigh, NC, 27605-1832                                               
&gt; Of course, stickers are free, but I always welcome other cool stickers
&gt; in trade if people have club stickers, local, etc...                  
&gt;                                                                       
&gt;                                                                       

Trivia for those ole timers only on one list:

FWIW, Al Knoll replied and let me know that Martha says 'Hi!', Bradley's 
nowhere to be found and Schwarze (who replied from T2) has a new career 
as a Husband.

Hooper and Dolan are hanging out on the T2 list. Unca Joel is here, 
there and everywhere.

Thom Fitzpatrick is admin of the VB list. Tom Carrington is running 
Vanagon and I don't know who the hell the admins of T2 are this week. ;o)
