Subject: new email

First, thanks to everyone for the positive feedback.

I have changed my personal email to joe_at_bustedbus_dot_com. All the old ones
still exist and will be answered. I may have problems from time to time with
not getting and not being able to send emails. So if I don't reply it's not
because I don't like you or your bus, well maybe some, no seriously if you
don't hear from us please give us a call or zap your number to us from our
home page (left handed side text box) and we'll call you back in seconds
(during business hours). Next time you need some help with your bus try it
out.
