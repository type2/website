&gt; While I've got the engine out of my 72 type2, I decided to install an oil pressure sender so I can easily add the guage when I get more money.  My problem is, with the type4 engine, the sender and the distributer hit each other.  What is the best way to seperate the two?  Thanks for any comments or suggestions.  

I put mine in as follows.

I used a 3 inch piece of brass pipe, and a 90 degree angle.  same size as
the oil sender fittings.  I found these at my FLAPS.  it is a very TIGHT
fit but it all fits and you can still turn the distributor so it can be
adjusted

hope this helps, there are other ways and I am sure others will pipe up
