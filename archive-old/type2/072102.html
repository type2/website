I have tried this a few times.  The only problem is that the connectors go
very brittle with age and it only takes a slight squeeze sometimes to snap
the sides clean off where they are rolled over.  The best solution is
always to cut the connector off and fit a new one.  (Unless you have the
proper tooling it's best to get the kind without the plastic ferrule on and
solder it then cover with heatshrink sleeving to provide some strain
relief.)
