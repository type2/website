Subject: RE: [T2] Barrett Jackson results

	The only case I have seen where an older vehicle was not registered
under the year it was produced, was my current neighbors 4x4.  The previous
owner had completely restored it but replaced the engine and maybe some of
the drive train with a newer one.  Somehow, it was registered under a later
year because of this.  I can't remember the details but maybe this will
spark someone's memory?

&quot;Never regret. If it's good, it's wonderful. If it's bad, it's experience.&quot;

I don't know. When I search on the VIN I find it was smogged in 1996  
as a 66 vehicle?
