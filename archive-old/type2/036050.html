and thinking about it, I believe he's right and I was wrong.
When the pistons move back far enough to uncover the fill ports 
(the two places the resevior plugs into the master cylinder) then 
indeed the two pressure lines are connected to the supply ports. Anyone
have a master cylinder out to check this against? 

	I've never seen a 'gravity bleed' done but I suppose if you set-up 
the bleeder overnight it would work. Live and learn.

	I still think fluid goes past the seals if you're pumping it out 
using the master cylinder- after full stroke, when you release the
brake pedal and the pistons move back to the fill position, then either 
fluid from the pressure side of the system flows BACK into the master 
cylinder or fluid from the resevior flows around the seals. If there's 
no pressure in the output side of the system (ie one bleeder open) then 
for the piston affected I expect fluid flows from the fill port past the 
seal. 
	I justify that by noting that I don't see much back flow when 
bleeding, when air bubbles or old/new fluid boundaries make it possible to
observe... I wonder if I'm right or wrong here too :)

	Note that if you bleed one half at a time, fluid IS flowing back
from the pressureized side to the other piston. Another plus for the vaccum
system or a pressure bleeder- no back-flow.

	That's why we put a hose on the bleeder and a catch jar with the
hose under a standing fluid level, so that air isn't sucked back
into the system.

	So how much does a home-use pressure bleeder cost? :)
