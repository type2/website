Subject: Dropped seats and new heads...

Shelby wrote...

&gt;  have seen them go in and out.   if the seat has
&gt;  dropped or is starting to drop then the valve should
&gt;  stick farther into the head, away from the piston.  
&gt;  if the seat comes loose and starts to come away from
&gt;  the head it can make the valve go closer to the
&gt;  piston. 

Y'know, that makes sense... now I know why my valves on lily on her first 
motor were getting tighter and tighter... Right before she blew up. I'll file 
this one in the back of my mind... and carry a spare set of heads!

Speaking of... I wonder (and this is just woolgathering) why no one has ever 
redesigned heads for type 4's, from the bottom up?  I mean,dropped valve 
seats are not real common, but for type 4 motors (and few others)... Not even 
their cousins, Type 1's and Corvairs have this problem...  One can get 
aftermarket heads for darn near everything, I've seen stuff like that at the 
local FLAPS (does HP stuff too) and there has got to be someone on this list 
that has to have either the engineering talent to design this or know someone 
who does...  I know it's a limited market, but I've also seen stuff for 
classic cars (my partner at work is into 40's hotrods... think *we* have an 
expensive hobby? &lt;grin&gt;) where  hobbyist engineered and made parts for like 
minded owners... I mean, how many Packard straight 8's are around, yet 
there's a guy in PA makes front end and motor parts for them in his machine 
shop.  And there used to be a  guy in SF (Fred Stelling, if memory serves me 
right) who made industrial gaskets as his business, and would make head 
gaskets and seals for anything, as long as someone made a tracing for him, 
same thing, pretty much at cost for fellow enthusiasts plus a couple dollars 
to make it worthwile (he passed away years ago, sadly...)...
 
There's a lot of type 4 motors out there.  A lot more than '52 Packards.  
Anyone up to the challenge?
