I myself just bought a dual exhaust GT Sport for my 72' from RMMW. What
years are you guys refering to.  I need to know what I have to look
forward to.

&gt;    Is this the dual muffler type like sold by RMMW? If so, forget it.
&gt; I'm on my second one -- the first died in about 6 months because the
&gt; weld on one muffler failed, RMMW replaced it no problem, but that one is
&gt; also failing despite my having put a big U-bolt clamp to hold up the
&gt; outer end of the muffler.
&gt;     Another bad thing is that there isn't room for the heat tube from
&gt; the blower to the left heat exchanger.
