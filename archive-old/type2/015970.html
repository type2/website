Subject: '72 Charging Circuit
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990710153112.007b8890_at_internetwork_dot_net&gt;

Recently I replaced the alternator and voltage regulator on my '72 after
the red light came on.  It was definitely not charging as the battery ran
down several times before repairs were made.

After installing the new alternator and regulator, the red light still
stayed on and the system was not charging.  Under the dash we found the
blue wire from the regulator to the alternator indicator light and the
brake system warning light had been incenerated.  After these were
restored, all was okay.

Here are my questions for the Electrical Wizards:  Was there nothing wrong
with the old alternator and/or regulator?  Can somebody explain to me why
the system would not charge simply because the indicator light and brake
warning light were not connected?  Does this blue wire connected to the
indicator light/brake warining light have to be charged 12V in order for
the alternator to put out a charge?  Could I have temporarily gotten the
system charging again by hot wiring the blue wire from the regulator to the
battery?
