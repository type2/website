Subject: Compression Ratio

Esteemed list,

I am looking for advice on resetting compression ratio on a Type 1.  1835
cc, 92mm pistons (got them on a trade), Engle 110 cam, stock DP heads, dual
Dellorto FRD 34's.

Originally, I set this up to be 7.6:1 CR.  The heads run super hot (I knew
it would with 92's, but like I said, I got them on a trade).  Compression
135 psi all around.  Max advance 32 deg. with an 009 (flame suit on).  I
plan to install new barrel shims to bring down the CR to something cooler.

Options based on standard shim sizes (pmail with your vote):
	7.49:1
	7.34:1
	7.20:1
	7.06:1

This is a weekend warrior bus, not a daily driver, and I know that
larger-than-stock leads to high heat and short life.  In other words, this
is &quot;fast while it lasts,&quot; I am just trying to optimize the setup.  I would
gladly give up some of my newfound power to bring the heads down to normal
operating temp.

And if you know much about the Dellorto FRD's, please pmail me also.

Thanks,
Will Anderson
