Subject: diesel engine, baywindow, or vanagon wanted

As many of you have read in my previous posts I want to run biodiesel or 
veggie oil in a bay or vanagon.  So, I am looking for a diesel engine or a 
bay or vanagon with a diesel engine already in it.  I would prefer to trade 
my 79 Westy (automatic), my 89 Volvo 240DL wagon, or some of my spare bus 
engines for it.  Otherwise I can sell one to pay for it.  So let me know 
what you have and what you want for it.  As well as what kind of condition 
it is in and where you are located.
Thanks,
Kyle
