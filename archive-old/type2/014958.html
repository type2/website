Dear 900+ listees,

My car is a 1971 westi, these comments are primarily relevant to similar
devices, I live in the SF Bay area in California in the USA.

With regards to timing, realize that timing is dependent upon compression
ratio.  If you or anyone before you have rebuilt at all, compression has
likely changed at least a little and maybe a lot if the heads were fly cut,
or the case is different or the rods were changed or the even the bearings
could affect the CR.  If you've decided to rebuild to lower compression and
have used either dished pistons, semi-hemi heads, FI stepped heads or
simply barrel spacers and your CR is less than 7.0:1, you can increase
timing.  If you've gone the other way (higher CR) and have fly cut heads of
big bores or such, you should retard from stock.  VW changed the deck
height on cases to vary the CR so you should be measuring this yourself.
My Mexican AS21 case has .067&quot; deck with a new stock P&amp;C on fresh bearings
and fresh rods.  I use Gene Berg Ent. semi-hemi heads without spacers
(57cc), or you can use .04 or even .06 spacers with stock heads, or use
dished pistons (like SCAT does with their new long blocks) to get
compression DOWN to 6.7,8or9:1.  Compression creates heat along with power
but your air-cooled bus works so hard you over generate heat if you don't
drop the CR from the stock settings (7.3-7.6:1 depending on the year)  Your
engine will make slightly less power but it is all useable because it can
then hold 4000 rpm up long steep hills in the summer fully loaded, on
regular gas, without overheating.  Please refer to a previous post
(9/14/98) for more rap on jetting to keep things cool.

I'm presently getting 19 avg. mpg (16+ town, 20+ _at_65-70 mph)on 140 mains in
the Weber 34 ICT carbs, 009/pertronix dist set at 15 BTDC static, single
muff extractor and 6.9:1 CR with 87 oct gas.  There is no flat spot, it
never pings and it can pull from well under 2000 rpm in any gear, I limit
revs to 4500 with the rotor.  This engine runs cool (oil under 180 deg at
70 mph, 65 deg air temp) and has 18500 miles on it at present.  Perhaps I
could get better mileage if I went to 135 mains, but I know engine temps
would rise.  Driving slower might work too.

For the guy trying to fix his heat exchangers, don't bother, get
replacements, test them if you can.  I was getting Carbon Monoxide readings
of up to 100 ppm in the cabin and I am relieved to find the meter steady at
&quot;0&quot; since I replaced the exchangers.  I had &quot;repaired&quot; the old exchangers.

For folks considering buying tires, if you haven't felt the difference
between load range &quot;C&quot; tires and passenger tires, you should.  This bus has
the Michelin XZX (reinforced) in front and a Big O &quot;Sun Valley AP&quot; 27 x
8.50 R14LT (M+S) in the back.  It is a nice combination of parkability,
stability and load carrying strength.

Oil leaks have kept me humbled, but I recently knocked off a couple.  I
refit the oil pump with great care (go ahead, ask me how) and now it
doesn't leak.  I replaced several pushrod tubes and thought I had them
clean until I went for a trans-bay drive and splattered the rear window
with oil.  Low and behold I had not properly seated one of the seals on the
case and it was torn.  I was amazed at how quickly this seemingly small
breech emptied the entire sump.  After carefully installing a new seal,
which is difficult with those EMPI aftermarket tubes all oiled up, the
engine now has only the tiniest of drips off the rear of the case even
after full on highway runs.  I do not recommend the plastic tubes that are
sold (they leak and could melt), or even the ones with nut-adjustable seals
(they can't expand with the heat), get the good ones, EMPI spring loaded.
I am so excited I put in a couple quarts of synthetic oil.

I had purchased and installed fog lights for the winter runs into snow
country and had mounted them below the front bumper.  This is really
stupid, I broke one of the lenses within a week running into a parking
bumper, and had scraped them several other times.  That front bumper
clearance is there for good reasons called driveways and curbs.  Moving the
lights to the top of the bumper meant fussing with the bumper itself, but
now they don't hit anything.  They are not really that helpful except in
the super serious thick fog or blizzards.  Changing the headlamps to
halogen was way more effective and easy/sort of inexpensive to do.  Well,
easy except for the headlamp rings being rusted out and also finding out
the PO (previous owner) had reversed one of the rings in an attempt to fit
it.  After some re drilling and tapping I got both lamps to fit correctly
with the adjusting screws functioning.  A few nights of driving around dark
streets and comparing the beams to other cars and I gradually got them
focused where they do good.  On low, right lamp down the line about 60 feet
out, left lamp down the center of the lane about 75 feet out.  Hit the
highs and the street signs light up.

Another piece of work was to repair the racket the generator had recently
started to make.  I had thought the fan was coming loose, but was amazed to
find the entire generator shaft banging around on horribly worn bearings.
I put an alternator replacement (motorola) in and now have 50 amps
available.  This unit seems to have to get up to speed before getting
enough juice to start it's own stator, but once it does it holds on strong.
 No longer do I wonder if charging the 1000cca battery, running high beams,
fog lights, blower, stereo, extra tail lamps and turn signals at the same
time will overload the generator.

Oh, another thing I did was buy a 3&quot; Bilge type blower from a marine supply
store (West-Marine) and fit it to the heat duct under the car.  It fits
snug over the existing tube coming out of the frame and I then used flex
ducting to get it forward of the removed &quot;Y&quot; junction that used to feed the
floor.  It does help, especially when in traffic or drifting downhill when
the engine is not turning many rpm's.  It is, however, an uncomfortably
loud and annoying whine, even from below the cabin.  I use it mostly to
help clear the windscreen when necessary.  I am quite sure this blower is
the exact same thing JB sells for way more money.  I paid $16.  Check the
post 6/11/98 for a couple heating tricks, along with that happening
bulli-bus website.

My last trip was into the Los Padres Nat. Forest for a couple days on the
trail.  The crossing from King City to the coast on Nacimento-Ferguson road
is a favorite.  An inland climb to 3000 feet, then a sharp drop to sea
level in 7 miles.  Many of the curves are so tight you're looking out the
side window to see around.  I stopped halfway down to let the brakes cool,
even though I was letting the engine do most of the work.  On the coast I
met a friend coming up from LA, spent the night at a nearby campground then
headed back up to the ridge at 3000 feet the next morning.  From there we
continued up the Coast Ridge Road on dirt and climbed to 3600 feet where we
parked his car at where we planned to come out in two days.  We both jumped
in the bus and continued up to 4200 feet and then walked up Cone Peak for
great views of the coast range, ocean and inland. From there we tried an
old trail that had not been maintained and managed to follow it down to the
valley, stopping for the night along the way at a nice spot called Carrizo
Spring.  The weather was gorgeous, the terrain impressive and mighty, we
were feeling pretty good.  The next day we ran into a surly rancher that
had closed the public right of way across his land and we had to hitchhike
out in order to get back to the cars.  We could not face retracing our
descent through that steep, thick, overgrown trail.  We managed to get a
truly miraculous ride from the middle of nowhere out to a campground, and
&gt;from there another great ride in a pick-up truck that actually took us the
3.6 miles up the dirt road to my friends car.  From there way headed back
to the bus and found a campsite for the night.

A few things that are obvious became pronounced.  

You can't know everything,(the trail guide said there was public access
across the private land).  

Some people are nice (the folks who picked us up hitchhiking), some people
aren't (the rancher).

Back country miles are way longer than highway miles.  Even driving in a
car the 6 miles out the Coast Ridge Road takes close to an hour.  Those
roads are steep, bumpy and curvy.  Walking takes even longer.

The bus is a remarkable resource in these situations, it has food, water,
stove and comfort.  It never missed a beat.

I love this stuff.
