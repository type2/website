Subject: Re: [T2] '71 disc brake questions

There should be a pair of piston positioner plates in there.  these are
the same shape as the pad backing plates, but with two cutout and bent
notches to hold the pistons in the correct position.  I forget what the
correct position is, but it seems to me that it the pistons would creep
around in use as they are applied over and over.  VW put those plates in
for some reason!

&gt; I just rebuilt a couple of '71 calipers but there was nothing between the

&gt; have the notch on the piston surface pointing down as to avoid water pooling
&gt; in there. I assume this is correct.
