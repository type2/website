List Members,

  I have way too many VW parts and am trying to clean them out.  Don't really want to trash them; don't really want to auction them off.  I'd rather trade them (the whole shebang)!

  What I have: a whole bunch of '72 parts - full compliment of seats for a 7-passenger (tan, good condition), good steering box, good &quot;002&quot; tranny, full instrument panel, bunch of other misc. &quot;stuff&quot;.

  What I'm looking for: a decent, mid/high power stereo amplifier OR a mid-sized, running street motorcycle project (no basket cases please).

  I'm located in the Central Pennsylvania area. P-mail me off-list please.
