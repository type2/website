Subject: Breadloaf Safari Windshield

While going through some photos yesterday I came across an 
example of a rare breadloaf option...

M-BR549  Safari windshield

I called a friend of mine who is a K-Mart manager and into later 
buses, and he said that he has several of these in his parts 
stash and would be willing to sell them (along with installation 
kit) for $75 each.

To see one installed, set your browser to:

Hope to see some of you this weekend in Tampa!
