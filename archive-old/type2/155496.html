Subject: Re: [T2] how do I install a baby seat in a bus

I wouldn't mount it to the jump seat. Puts the child too close to the window
for my comfort.

In my 73 I mounted to the back seat/bed next to the cabinet. This provides
some protection and distance from the outside of the bus in case I'm
T-boned. In my 78 with 7-pass seating, she's in the middle seat on the
passenger (right) side. Again some distance from any oncoming vehicles.

Because of the room you have, you can use the biggest most heavy duty seat
you can find. The one I'm using doesn't fit in my Volvo at all. But in the
bus it's not a problem. The larger seats also tend to be more comfortable
and the kid won't grow out of it as quickly. (She's nearly 3 and already the
seat in the Volvo is getting too small.)
