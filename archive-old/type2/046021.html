Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cooler Seals

In my 1800, my oil cooler seals were leaking and I didn't want to pull
the entire engine. I had to drop the exhaust so I could get the fan
shroud off and then I had great access to the cooler and the seals. As
you are taking the nuts and washers off of the oil cooler studs so you
can pull the oil cooler off, be SURE you pay attention to where all the
washers go. I accidentaly put the washers in the wrong place and they
actually held the cooler just far enough off the seals to make the seals
leak. Live and learn. Gook luck.
