Subject: [T2] Brake vaccum check valve thingy

What exactly is that plastic bit called that goes in the vacuum line for
the booster (servo) back near the engine tin? Y'know, the one with the
little arrow that points at the motor. What does it do? IIRC, Bentley
tells how to test it, but my Bentley's in the bus at the shop.
