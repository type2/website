Subject: RE:  oil pressure gauges

&gt;I have a 70 Bus and I want to put a oil pressure gauge in it. I have 
&gt;the gauge out of my Bug, but I don't have a long enough hose to 
&gt;make the  connection. The FLAPS only sell a hose setup for 
&gt;non-VW's, where the engine is in the front so the hose is only 6-8ft 
&gt;long. Its a long way back to the engine on the Bus. I know others 

Everybody I know is using an electrical gauge.  There's a sender that
mounts where the stock oil pressure dummy light sender mounts and it
sends a signal to an electrical gauge.  

I'd have to recommend against using a mechanical gauge on any
rear-engined vehicle because of the length of hose required.  The longer
the hose, the more likely it will eventually get cut/punctured/torn.

BTW, if any of y'all are looking for an electrical oil pressure gauge
and don't want to spring for the $70 for a new VDO gauge and sender,
take a look around your local junk yard.  Look for older Audis,
water-cooled VWs, Porsche 924s, etc.  Many of them used VDO oil
pressure, oil temp, voltmeter, etc. gauges and can be had for cheap.
Just remember to pull the associated sender as well.
