Subject: Re: tires for 74 westy (or other)

      Along this line, what is the biggest tire practical on these
buses? As I recall on my earlier bus, getting bigger rims is a problem
because the bus has offset rims to keep the tire under the body and
inside the rear wheel arch of the body.
      Has anyone found good rims (like 7&quot;-8&quot; wide) that  do fit? And
what's the biggest tire that fits and doesn't rub on bumps?
