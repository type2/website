Subject: Re: [T2] Future of the type IV engine?

&gt;Know of any builder who will offer a decent warranty on their work? That is
&gt;why I do all my own work. I am better than any builder as I will use what I
&gt;am building and hence will be super anal about the quality and workmanship
&gt;going into it.

EXACTLY. The ones that do good work I cannot afford. I can spend alot of 
time though checking and rechecking my own work for &quot;free&quot;.

As for the cost and durability questions for Type I vs. Type IV - if folks 
don't like the Type IV engines then do what feels right and send me your 
spare Type IV engines. I've got 4 right now and wouldn't mind have another 
2 or 3. So far I figure I've got enough to get past the 750K mile mark on 
my VW so I think I'm set so I don't worry about spare part availability. &lt;grin&gt;
