Ola,

I got some bad news and need to make a decision here so i could use your
advice.  My 71 westy could be cooked.  I took it to a mechanic to get some
stuff done on it and he put it up on the hoist and immediately said not to
bother, too much rust.  He said that the front and back support beams (?)
and the rocker panels were shot.  The thing is though, that the subfloor is
still there as well as the 6 support beams that run perpendicular to the
front and rear, is that clear ?  Also, the battery tray is mostly rusted
out and the ball joints are close to being done.  Anyways, he said to
forget about it and to part it out.  The body is in decent shape, a lot of
fiberglassing has been done around the bottom of the van, as well as under
the wheelwells.  Mechanically, it is in great shape.  With the exception of
a shorted out starter wire, the engine runs well and the tranny deosn't
grind or miss gears.  Brakes are good and the interior is in good condition
as well.  I have already thrown money at a vehicle that still doesn't run
properly so...should I keep this and work on it over the next little few
years or sell it ?  Thanks for your help.  Later days !!
