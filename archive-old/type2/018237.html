          Given that the stock '72 tank has no return line for the fuel
pressure regualtor, how did you solve this problem? I've experienced
somewhat the same problem as you are describing, but it's not all the
time, usually only when the engine is hot, and then I have a long idle.
What it seems to me to be is vapor-lock -- and the reason I deduced why
mine does it is that my '73, like yours, has no return line for the
tank, so I put a T in the line before the fuel pump, for the regulator
return line. Someone else said awhile back that the tank acts as heat
sink for the fuel, and without that, it's a bit prone to vapor-lock. On
mine, it only happens during serious heat situations (long traffic lines
after getting off the freeway in Alabama) so I just turn it off, rather
than sit there and idle.
        Probably should change the tank, but I'm lazy, and more inclined
to dump the gas engine and put in a turbodiesel anyway.
        And if that ain't it, I have no clue.  Could be just that your
fuel line got routed too close to something hot, too.
