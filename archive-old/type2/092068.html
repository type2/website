Subject: Re: [T2] Seat and Seatbelt Questions

Don,

I spent part of a week day a couple weeks ago walking through a wrecking
yard looking for various things. One primary target was retractable seat
belts.  I found a pair of good condition shoulder (3 point) from a (no
wreck) Rabbit convertible.  I also grabbed the retractable lap belts
from the back seat for my back seat.

To install the bottom part of the 3 points I made a bracket from 2&quot; x 2&quot;
angle iron to mount the retractor  to the original mount.  The drivers
side was kind of like this:

	Caution: Poor ASCII art
    _____________
   /        __   |    
  /        |__|  |    &lt;---- Hole for retractor assy
 /               |
|                |
|---| |----------|
|---| |----------|
     ^
     |
     | Hole for existing floor / pedestal mount

The passenger side was the mirror image.  I beveled the corners of the
angle iron away from the corners and hit it with some black rustoleum. 
They look better than the effort put into them.

The offset was made to mount retractor back against the seat back
partition and in the same orientation as it was in the rabbit (forward /
aft).

The upper mount needed a bit of a spacer and long bolt to set the upper
mount out enough to clear the body joint just behind the door.  This
wasn't a problem except that I found previously boogered up threads on
the driver side.  As an aside; Does anyone know exactly what the bolt
and thread size is for seat belt mounts.  They don't seem to be standard
Metric or SAE.  Something like eleven mm 1.25 or 15/32 20.


Getting that one mounting bolt right has taken me far more time and
effort than installing my new retractables.  Total cost of the project
was about $45 including buying the angle iron.

Comfort level increased greatly!

Hope this helps,

Bob

&gt; &gt; can I do this, if so anyone have them?
