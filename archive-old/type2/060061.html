Subject: Hard shifting

&gt; My friend's 77 bus is giving her some grief, so I thought send out a
&gt; query
&gt; for anyone interested to chew on.  She's having a hard time getting the
&gt; gear shift into 1st gear (most always) and 2nd gear (sometimes).  At a

--&gt;  I've seen a lot of good suggestions posted, but if you can't get it
to work well by adjusting the shift plate, wriggle under the bus and have
a look at the end of the shift rod.  When I had this problem, I found my
shift rod was bent right where it attaches to the coupler.  The previous
owner had somehow (presumably during an engine pull) bent this rod and
cracked the front tranny mount.  Straightening the rod made an immediate
improvement in the shift pattern.  Eventually the coupler failed and had
to be replaced as well.  You can check the coupler by lying under there
while someone rows the shifter through the gears -- it should move back
and forth and turn side to side with very little slop.  If the rod rotates
more than the transmission side of the coupler, you've found the problem.

(As for the tranny mount, I still haven't replaced it.  It seems they're
unavailable.  Recycled Bugs said, 'yeah, we have trouble getting those.
People tend to over-tighten them and crack them.'  Heh.)
