Hi,

&gt; I'm thinking of a weekly Friday post something like the Weakly Statz, but
&gt; which is nothing but a clickable list of aircooled resources.

 I think that's an excellent idea. There's heaps of info on
type2_dot_com which some people just arn't seeing and helping people
to recognise it (and others) would be great.

 It would be useful if it were practical to include a short summary
of what was available at the other end of the link, but if that would
tip the workload over the edge of feasibility then it would be better
to have it without than not have it at all.

 I'd like to be able to volunteer to help with this but I'm changing
jobs on Monday and I can't commit the time to do it properly until I
know how busy I'll be. I'll try to help if I can, though.

Cheers,
       W.
