&gt;A buddy of mine was telling me about it. I was just surfing the web on the 
&gt;various companies that either give you a car or pay you to drive your car with a 
&gt;3M type sticker ad on it.  I know it sounds funny.  Just wondering if anyone 
&gt;has done it.  Is it as good as it sounds? 

This is quite common for advertizers. They also put a mileage counter in your vehicle so they know you are truly &quot;getting the word out&quot;. Given the price of gasoline, you might not make any money out of it while driving a bus.
