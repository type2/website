Hi all!

With my camper now running, I am going over it to ensure all is right to pass 
very strict Maryland inspections. 
I need a new seat belt connector for the drivers side of my bus. Not the belt 
itself but what it snaps to which bolts to the floor area. (you know where 
you hook it into and out of to be safe)! Bet its got a name, and I bet I 
don't know it!
Anyway, anyone out there with an extra from a parts bus, let me know!
Many thanks!
Melissa
