Subject: fuel injection woes

Hello Friends,
My 1978 2.0 Fuel Injection Westy has some serious fuel injection problems.
The new AVP motor wouldn't start.  I call the local VW expert.  Who
determines that the fuel injection system was not being powered up by the
double relay (no power to the series resistor).  He jumps 12 volts to the
series resistor.  Motor starts!  He says the double relay is dead.  I
replace relay.   Motor still will not start without jumped relay.
After much investigation I discover I have not hooked up the wire to the
double relay which comes from the + terminal of the ignition coil.  Dumb me!
Wire replaced and motor starts!  All is well for about one minute when the
motor shuts down on its own and will not restart.
 I do more diagnostics using the VW fuel injection book and determine (not
with certainty because of fogginess in the diagram of the big plug which
goes into the motor's computer) that perhaps the computer is now dead.  Woe
is me.
So the question is:  did jumping the 12v. to the series resistor wreck the
computer or is there something else wrong with this wretched machine?
One of you real experts must know the answer.
Thanks for any help or any attempt of help.
Drew
