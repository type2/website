The best tool I have ever bought was a pressure washer.  This would be ideal 
for cleaning the fins, over, under, round and through...the whole engine 
drivetrain.  Spray the whole engine with engine degreaser, wait and blast it. 
 If you don't want to invest in one ($175) then rent one for $25...just 
remember to wrap the distributer with a taped on plastic bag 
and do the same for your exposed carberation unit...oh, and don't forget to 
be careful around wires (they have a tendency to blow off).
