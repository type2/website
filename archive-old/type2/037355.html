Subject: Re: [VB] Stainless Metric Hardware

Nobody is talking about a lesser known quality of stainless steel 
fasteners. They aren't nearly as strong as standard automotive steel 
fasteners. I'm going to summarize a discussion on just this topic, recently 
seen on another list:

A word of caution about stainless: It is not nearly as strong as common 
steel fasteners, especially if the threads are cut instead of rolled. Most 
stainless bolts are about equivalent to a standard steel grade 2 bolt, and 
most standard steel fasteners used in the automotive industry are grades 5 
to 8.

You can buy specially prepared stainless bolts that are stronger, but they 
are not widely available and are very expensive. Look to the suppliers of 
the airline and the nuclear industries for the exotic and strong stainless 
fasteners. The marine industry also likes them.

So, be warned, and be thoughtful about where you put the stainless 
replacement. It will probably not corrode, but it may break. If the job 
requires strength, perhaps you should consider a coated  standard steel 
fastener. And broken stainless fasteners are very hard to remove because 
they work harden as they are drilled. Use the highest grade of drill when 
working on them.
