OK, we've got the  five orders today. Thanks very much!
Those of you who wrote earlier and are sitting on the
fence, the deal is a go and the more people we get
the more we will save on freight, and the 10% discount
is a sure thing. 

Besides, these are not routinely available in the US,
and we will all be able to share tricks and problems 
as we install them .(Don't worry Gerry and Ken, we will
keep that traffic off the list).

Let me know by Monday evening!

Tom F.
