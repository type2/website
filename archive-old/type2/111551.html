Subject: &lt;sorry, off topic&gt; URGENT! 66 sunroof beetle in WA.

Sorry for the lack of topic, but I can't stand to think of this car being &quot;disposed of&quot;. I have a 66 sunroof beetle, condition specifics unknown, engine gone but tranny is there. When I left Washington state, my ex-husband sold it without my permission and without the title. The person waited for the title but obviously never got it so he sold it to someone else and told them to get the title themselves. They wrote to me, I called them, told them I never authorized a sale and never did anything more with it (too frustrated that I was stuck here in OK with no way of getting it here at the time, and no info system like the internet to find someone else to take it). Anyway, I recently recieved a letter from someone who says it has been sitting on his property for 6 years and is now taking the legal steps to dispose of it. I CAN'T go up there and get it and I have roughly a WEEK to find someone who will take it before he has it destroyed.

It was my first Beetle and first Air-cooled, so I have a sentimental attachment to it, but I haven't the money to get it here now. I REALLY wish I could. Unfortunately, it would be too cost prohibitive to try to get it here... especially without a motor.

Anyway, if ANYONE wants it, PLEASE e-mail me offlist (especially since it is not Type 2 related)... please use the work e-mail address below.

sorry for the off-topic post, I hope someone can save this beetle.
