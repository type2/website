Subject: Popped oil gallery plug

	O wise list, I have a boon to beg of thee.

	There are two little oil gallery plugs on my 1.8 T4 case, about where the
screw-in oil filter branches off. One of the popped earlier this morning,
spewing oil all over a north Austin highway. I heard the engine change tone,
saw that my oil pressure was zero, freaked out and pulled over.

	What is to be done? A Hoover sermon in the archives suggests tapping, and
them forcing pressurized oil through the oil pressure sender hole to flush
out the shwag from the tap. Anybody tried this? Alternately, I've heard

a) stuffing a sponge or something in there and blowing out the shavings with
compressed air
b) putting grease on the tap, so the shavings stick
c) prayer, followed by premature engine failure

	I'd like to avoid using all the oil if I could, but I don't want to be
making stupid risks, either.

	I'm also looking at the other plug, which is JB-welded all to heck, and I
can see little bits of oil sneaking through cracks. Since I'll likely be
yanking the exhaust and fan assembly to reach these things, I figure I might
as well tap and plug that one too. How do I get the old one out?

	Cheers,
	Ian
