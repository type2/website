Subject: Reminder: This Saturday - 9th Annual Mid Atlantic Holiday Bus
  Fest

Come one, come all. Spouses, significant others and
children welcome. No descrimination on buses, either:
we usually are graced by examples of each of the four
major groups.

If you'd like to see a bit about previous events,
check Tom C.s page http://volksweb.relitech_dot_com/

If you know you are coming, please let me know (unless
you already have) so that we can get an idea of the
head count. This year there will be some
pre-personalized doorprizes, so the sooner you are on
the list the more likely it is you'll get a special
treat!

Don't worry though, if you decide to come at the last
minute you will certainly be welcome: surprise us!

Dec 6  1-5pm
7001 Westmoreland Ave. 
Takoma Park MD 20912
-use Mapquest-
(301) 270 8073 

Hope we will see you there,

Tom Forhan
