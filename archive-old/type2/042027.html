Subject: RE: Gas filler leak

&gt;===== Original Message From jim &lt;jiminwis_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt; =====
&gt;I would have sworn that I just read something about
&gt;this in a recent post, but I can't find it (maybe it
&gt;is &quot;old-timers&quot; disease that my son says that I have).
&gt;
&gt;My problem is that I get some seepage of gasoline from
&gt;the filler neck of the gas tank when the gas tank is
&gt;full.  It seems to seep out where the flexible rubber
&gt;hose from the filler on the side of the bus meets the
&gt;metal neck on the tank.  Should this have a clamp on
&gt;it, be sealed with gasket sealer or other sealer, or
&gt;what is the best thing to do?

On my '74 there are clamps.  The only way to get to them was when the shop had 
the engine out to do some work on it.  They were cool and let me replace them 
while they did the engine work.  If you know how to get your engine out ( I 
haven't been that brave/adventurous yet.), it isn't to difficult to do.
