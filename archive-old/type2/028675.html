Subject: (T2) Patterns for Interior Panels for 71 Westy
Date: Sun, 26 Nov 2000 19:55:32 -0800
Message-ID: &lt;NDBBJGENECDFOLEPFDLNKEDMCKAA.ppalika_at_home_dot_com&gt;

Importance: Normal

Listies I've got a 71 Westy that I'm using for a daily driver.  The paneling
is in pretty sorry shape both in fit and condition (originals were replaced
by PO). I would like to be able to create the interior panels without using
the old one as templates.  Does anyone know of a place where I can get a set
of templates?

Thanks for the help, Paul
