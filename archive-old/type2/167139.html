Subject: Carb Course

Last Night I finally located a source of information on my 40 P11-4 carbs. It
is also a wellspring of information on how carbs work.
http://www.hillmanimages_dot_com/912/fuel3.html  Check it out.
Sadly, Dave Hillman passed away a few months ago. I am sure his friends deeply
miss him, his generosity and his valuable information.

 Unka Dave
