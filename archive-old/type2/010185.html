Greetings --
I just wanted to extend my thanks to all of you (too many to contact
individually!) who sent recommendations &amp; advice about my rear brake
adjustment episode (broken screwdriver tip in drum, etc.) -- on pulling the
drum, freeing/cleaning/lubing the adjustment star, and other associated
tips.  It's been very empowering; I'm in the process of pulling the drum to
fish that thing out and clean things up.  In fact, I've been trying to get
that damn thing off all day long with no luck -- it's stuck tight and very
stubborn.  Looks/feels like it's rusted around the hub area.  So, I've
semi-patiently been Liquid Wrenching the area and lightly hammer-tapping
the face of the drum in hopes of freeing it sometime soon.  And once I do
(fingers Xed), I can finally move on to putting the rest of your advice
into action.  Anyway, thanks again!
