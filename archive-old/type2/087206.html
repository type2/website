Subject: Re: [T2] ATF fluid leak Help !!!


I have always seated them till they bottomed out....leaves about 1/8&quot; or 
so of metal showing above the seal.

Never had a problem with this.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; rear seal, change it everytime you have engine out, Bus Depot has em for
&gt; &gt; a few bucks.  One key point do not push them all the way in but they

&gt; I'm not too sure this is correct bob. Section 5 page 49 of my bentley
&gt; says this:
&gt; note: &lt;excess stuff removed&gt; The oil seal must be seated squarely in
&gt; the crankcase recess
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From this i take it that seated means all the way to the back of the
&gt; lip. Now bentley doesn't say one way or the other &quot;all the way till
&gt; bottoming out&quot; but I have always considered seated to mean that.
&gt; Anyone have any comments?
