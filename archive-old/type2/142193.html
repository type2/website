North Tampa area.  Temp in high 80's and humidity level very sticky, but not
as bad as it has been.

I decided to take E2 out for a quick drive around the neighborhood before
dinner.  Went driving for about 10-15 minutes and got 
Her back in the garage.  Opened up the engine lid and noticed that there was
condensation on the outside of the lower area of the 
Carb and the port.  I placed my hand on the port and it felt very cool to
the touch.  

The rest of the engine bay and dipstick was warm (not hot)

Any ideas?

Thanks for the input.
