So... I'm at my favourite Canadian Tire looking for a coil for Folly's 
new/old motor, and the guy says, &quot;Is that with or without the internal 
resistor?&quot;

                                                                                                                                :-0

Geeze?  Do I need an internal resistor or not ??  HELP.  $36.00 I paid 
for the coil!  &lt; With the internal resistor.  I flipped a coin!  Was I 
right???&gt;
