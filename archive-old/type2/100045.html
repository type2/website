&gt; There is a Sportsmobile van conversion company here in Fresno, Calif! I keep
&gt; meaning to go by during the day to see if they have any old literature left.

As luck would have it, Sportsmobile Texas is right behind the building I
work in and I dropped in one day a couple of weeks ago to look around.  I
had an interest in the finishes of their fiberglass tops.

The office manager who helped me said they had no literature for VWs.  They
did have some neat pictures on the wall of old VW conversions to outline the
company history.

She gave me a business card and said to contact Alan through the website for
any VW related questions.  I don't see a links to that name but I remember
she said something about the California office, so maybe he's there.
