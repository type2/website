Subject: Campout Update

This just in... at the campout the night before the Bloomington Indiana car 
show, the local Indian tribe will be performing a sweat lodge ceremony. If 
you have any interest in watching or even want to joining in, you need to 
camp with us. As long as you are camping with us, you could even come to 
the VW car show the next day.
