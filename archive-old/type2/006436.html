X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Over the past few weeks I've done a lot of long distance traveling in our
'70 Campmobile with a stock 1600SP, and it has run like a sewing machine
through high altitude passes, gale force winds and rain, and even a brief
early snow storm.  Always started instantly, never missed a beat, and gave
good fuel mileage.

Wednesday morning I popped the engine lid and did my normal daily oil check
and engine inspection.  Something caught my eye as being &quot;different&quot;, but it
took a moment to pin it down.  The spade connector on the end of the
condenser lead, connecting to the coil terminal, was at an odd angle
relative to the green wire.

When I touched the connector the wire fell free.  The condenser wire had
been held to the spade connector by a single strand.  Close inspection
confirmed only one bright copper strand, all the rest were dark from
exposure to heat and atmosphere.  It took less than 5 minutes to install a
new terminal on the broken wire and get under way.

I'm amazed that the ignition system functioned normally over many hundreds
of miles with such a limited electrical communication between 2 absolutely
vital components.  Just another example of the ability of these &quot;primitive&quot;
engines to keep going under adverse circumstances.
