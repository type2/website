Subject: Re: [T2] doing push rod tube seals this weekend

Richard,

I used some engine oil on mine.

My favorite on the gaskets is to use 3m weatherstrip adhesive on the valve 
cover side only ...applied sparingly.  Make sure that where the gasket 
will go on the heads that the heads are absolutely spotless and flat.

Took me about 45 minutes each side when I did this last(damn PO).

Do not *ever* use any sort of rtv on the gaskets!

Cheers, dave

&gt;  I've got a couple of leaks at the push rod tubes that I'm going to attempt to remedy this weekend.  I bought a set of Viton seals from Bus Depot figuring I might as well do them all while I'm under there.
&gt; 
&gt; What kind of grease am I supposed to apply to the seals before I install them?  Also, I was planning on following Bartnik's advice and using grease on the valve cover gaskets.
