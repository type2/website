&gt; Bob,

&gt; Exides are standard batteries, right? But you find it worthwhile to

right but they are basically sealed, never spilled one.

&gt; have two in parallel. Do you fit both on the starter battery shelf?

one on each side.

BTW the optima is an overpriced version of a starved electrolyte (or Glas
mat) battery.  they are much better as deep discharge batteries and
probably work much better as the camping battery rather than the starting
battery.  I would suspect that the Optima will give good service but will
fail without warning in about 2-3 years.  one of the major problems of
this type of battery, they give full service until they fail, very little
warning before failing.

of course as always
YMMV

Bob

BTW Exide also sells a starved electrolyte battery
