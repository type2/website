&gt; 
&gt; First, some info:
&gt;   My bus is a '77 fi.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, the symptoms:
&gt;   The bus starts up fine, but when I try to rev the engine for the first
&gt; time, the rmps drop to almost nothing as soon as I press the accelerator
&gt; - it comes very close to tying.  Once it's warm, this problem goes away.
&gt; 
&gt;   I know that the muffler leaks - I'll be replacing it soon.  However,
&gt; there's some more air moving under the engine, and I'm not clear on what
&gt; that means.  I think I may have exhaust getting out from the exhaust
&gt; manifolds, and maybe the heater boxes, and the U tube going from the
&gt; manifold to the heater boxes.  I hate to replace all of that ($$$!), so
&gt; I'll be looking closer soon.
&gt; 
&gt;   When I look at the engine from the driver's side rear tire at night, I
&gt; can see blue every time the engine goes over, so I think the manifold or
&gt; u tube leak is fairly big....
&gt; 
&gt; Third, an Idea:
&gt;   Is the hesitation related to all that air I'm feeling down there, or
&gt; could it be something else?  If it's all leaks, why does it go away when
&gt; the van is warm?  Is there any way I can check the vaccum advance?  That
&gt; seems like a suspect since the problem comes up when I press the
&gt; accelerator...
&gt; 
&gt; Fourth, a question:
&gt;   Has anyone else priced exhaust components recently?  The price seems to
&gt; vary hugely.  I think I'll probably end up going with a muffler from JC
&gt; Whitney (woe is me) that replaces the cross-over and a few other
&gt; pieces...  I haven't seen any exhaust manifolds for sale anywhere - junk
&gt; yard!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance!

Ben,

I am in the position of having to replace my exhaust as well.  In your
case if a Catalytic converter is not required, try RMMW. They have an
extractor, and single quiet pack for less than $100 together, something
like $35 for the extractor, and $40 for a single quiet pack(I think that
is what they are called). There is a dual quiet pack(no extractor) for
about $136 or so. These prices are not exact, but close. 
Bug-e-warehouse in San Antonio Tx(look in VWT&amp;A for the number) also has
the same setups for a few $$$ less.

The air moving under your engine could be coming from the fan.  Do you
have your thermostat hooked up and working? If so, when it is cold, it
directs all of the air down over the oil cooler, and out of the engine.
Then as the engine warms, less air is directed over the oil cooler, and
towards the cylinders, though there is still a significant amount of air
directed over the oil cooler.

There is a possibility that the blue your are seeing, is a crack in the
distributor.  When I was having problems starting my 79, someone
suggested that I check the dist at night to see if there is a crack. 
This is a possibility to look towards.

Hope this helps

David
