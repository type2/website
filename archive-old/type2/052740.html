Subject: Re: [T2] driving with louvers open?

It seems that seemed a silly question (when I first read it) has indeed 
proven to be a topic worth the bandwidth.

So I'll add my two cents worth,  That a real danger of driving with them 
open is that when camping or maneuvering in unusual places they can and will 
snag on trees and other objects.  Experience  taught me anyway?!

I'm sure I will open them slightly in summer hot weather, knowing I do so at 
their detroment, but my concience will nag and I'm sure won't do so as 
often.

Thanks for everyones' input.
