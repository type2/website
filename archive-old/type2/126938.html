Subject: starter/switch

71 Bay Weekender, stock 1600 DP engine. Occasionally, I can turn my starter switch and the starter doesn't hit a lick. Sometimes I can try again and it will hit immediately on the second try. Sometimes it takes 3 tries. Sometimes it won't fire for 20 minutes, I can go back and it starts the first time. I suspect the starter or switch, but it happens on such an irregular basis, that I can't tell. Dash lights go on, I can hear the electic fuel pump, headlights will burn. Where should I start checking or what should I replace?
