Eddie,

Pictures please, please, please!!!!

I really would like to see this as I am totally intimidated
by trying to do this(no patience for body work).

It sounds like you did great!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey all--
&gt; 
&gt; I actually finished painting my bus last week. I am very satisfied with

&gt; This job was much easier than I expected it to be. The biggest problem I
&gt; had was the fact that I overestimeated the work needed to get a decent
&gt; paint job. Its really not that bad at all. If you have a bus in need of
&gt; nothing but paint, you're all set. Most of my time was spent with
&gt; bodywork, and surface Preparation. The paint itself only takes a few hours
&gt; to apply. This isn't to say i rushed it. I definitely took my time and put
&gt; a lot of care into each step. I'd recommend doing the same.
