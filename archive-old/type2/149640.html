Subject: Re: [T2] Transmissions

&gt;i was just looking at a '68 Westy in the yards on Thursday (beautiful day 
&gt;in Virginia, so I played &gt;hooky from school) and the engine was removed.  
&gt;The transmission looked so inviting...

I've seen unknown 002 trannies go for goofy money (~250 bucks) - I would 
grab it and pass it on to someone that needs it. The offroad guys love them.
