Subject: Rabbit oil filter compatibility? -Reply

Brett,
I had a new heater box put on my 75 and made it impossible to put the fat
bus filter on.  Peek Performance did my work (They sponsor the Bug-On,
Monrovia Md.) and they installed a rabbit filter.  Haven't had to take it off
yet but I guarentee it will be easier.  Also, Tosh Gregg talks about using a
rabbit filter in his bus in the &quot;Idiots Guide.&quot;  I am pretty sure this is the
same filter they use on Golfs also.  It has been my experience that you
can get a pretty good price for a case of these from a VW dealership.  I
say this because that is how my dad buys them and he is way frugal.
