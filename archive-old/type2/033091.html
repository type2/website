Subject: Re: Heater blower on... engine off

Simple fix.  You have the wire to the heater blower hooked to the points
side of the coil.  You need to move it to the 12v side and all will be
well.  What's happening is when you turn on the blower, you're grounding
(through the blower motor) the ignition system.
