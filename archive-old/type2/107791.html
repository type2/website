Subject: RE: [T2] injectors won't fire

You're right about the injectors needing ground from the ECU. For this to
happen, the ECU itself has to be grounded. IIRC there are three white-ish
wires coming off the ECU harness that plug into a male blade connector
bolted to top of the engine case under the left side of the intake manifold.
They are hard to see, and could be corroded; find them; make sure they are
hooked up and clean.

Am I correct that the ECU is supposed to ground this other terminal in
response to the points being closed?

If this is correct, can anyone suggest a reason for my ECU not giving the
proper ground to the injectors?
