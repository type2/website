Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Constant Velocity Joints

Well......they could be Allen head. I have seen Allen used up until about the
end of 77. Later ones are triple square [12 point]. Since he did not give the
year of his bus &lt;grrrh&gt; I will assume they are Allen.
Make SURE the holes are clean clean clean all the way to the bottom. Put your
Allen socket in. I hope you are using a socket and not a wrench? Get a pair of
vise grips. REAL Vise Grips, not Craftsmen, not Taiwan, not Chinese...get the
ones that have the brand name Vise Grip on them. They work. You never loose
money buying a good tool! Use the vise grips on the head of the bolt to break
it loose.



&gt; First off those are not allen screws.  They require a different tool.  Which
&gt; the name escapes me at the moment.
&gt;
&gt; Second...  Spray some Kroil or PB blaster on there,  If you have already
&gt; stripped the heads. The best thing to do would be to cut a groove in the
&gt; head with a dremel tool and use a flat head to take them out.  Remember if
&gt; they are in any kind of a bind they won't budge.
