If no answers arrive sooner, let me know and I'll check Bentley tonight.

&gt; Well, having just bought a new 1600dp long block and having
&gt; hurriedly stripped my old one for it's core, I did not
&gt; properly note the orientation of the metal gasket that lies
&gt; between the altnerator pedestal and the engine block. 
&gt; You know, the one that looks like:
&gt; 	 ______

&gt; 	 ------
&gt; 
&gt; So, does anyone know off the top of their head:
&gt; 
&gt; a) whether the metal &quot;baffles&quot; (for lack of a better word) on the gasket
&gt; 	point up into the pedestal or down into the block
&gt; 	(i seem to recall down into the block)
&gt; 
&gt; b) which direction the )))) point in (left, i believe).
&gt; 
&gt; I've got it on there, and it looks right, but I'd rather get
&gt; it right first off and my bentley, which i'm assuming has this
&gt; sort of info, still hasn't arrived in the mail.  *sigh*
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
