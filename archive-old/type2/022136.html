Hi Mike,
I know your response was in jest, and I smile in agreement, but it did
bring to mind an incident.

Back around 2-3 years ago, my wife and I travelled to Big Bend and
camped there for a week. It was early March, and it was quite cool at
night.

Well, our first night, we dug out the 99 cent throw away BBQ grill,
broke a 3 hour fire log into half, placed the log in the BBQ grill, and
lit up.

Over in another campsite, one of the other campers starting raising
Hell about our having an open fire in an area designated as a &quot;no open
fire&quot; area. We just ignored the self appointed campsite &quot;cop&quot; and
continued to enjoy our hot cocoa and poetry of the evening.

Next morning, at just the crack of dawn, we lit the 2nd half of our
&quot;log&quot; so as to break the chill.

Shortly after doing so, the campsite ranger came around on patrol, saw
what we did, and remarked, &quot;What a really clever idea.  We should sell
these things at the camp store; no open fire hazard, no sparks, no
hacking of local camp shrubs.&quot;

The next morning, the ranger brought another ranger with her to show
what we were doing, and to illustrate her desire that the local camp
store start carrying the grills and fire logs for campers who wanted a
&quot;campfire&quot; at night.

Sure made us feel like the Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wizard of the campground.
No ash to toss.
No logs to cut.
Just light her up,
and sit on your butt.
