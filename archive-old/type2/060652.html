At the chance of beating this (already?) dead horseto death..

IMHO &quot;restored&quot; vehicles (no matter how well done) are neither worth as much (or as desireable) as a well kept up original bus. simple reason is that the chances of any surprises hiding behind that shiny paint etc. good conditon westy's should not be as hard to find as say a commercial vehicles for the simple reason that they often they were only driven in summer months and were better taken care of.. (try finding a nice orignial paint DC for instance)

just my $0.02..
