Subject: Re: [T2] Middle and Back seats for a Bus?

Hi Kevin,
Close is a couple of feet.
I'm not surprised the roller work looks o.k..
The real cutting edge between good house painters &amp;
bad ones is what they can do with a brush.
For some reason rollers sort themselves out although
the paint usually doesn't end up flat like a spray
job.
Stencils are like that though.....I did some fish
stencils for our kitchen once &amp; they were REALLY
fiddly.
Still,most people don't care about little
flaws....this isn't the OCTO show afterall:-)
The bus looks cool.
:-)
Cheers

&gt; Hey Andrew, what is your definition of up close? 
&gt; Surprisingly enough,
&gt; the red and white is very hard to tell that it was
&gt; rolled on.  The
&gt; blue is pretty good also but the problem I had was I
&gt; made a stencil
&gt; for the stars and there is overspray on the blue.  I
&gt; would say if you
&gt; are farther then 5 feet away it looks real good,
&gt; anything closer and
&gt; you can see problem areas.
