Jake and George,

I don't understand Jake's response that VW went to DP for fuel
injection.  VW didn't go to fuel injection on the uprights till 1975
in the USA. 1971 through 74 Beetles were DP carbs. 71 was the only
upright engine bus in the USA and it was DP carb.

Concerning George's answer that DP was required to satisfy the 1600cc
displacement, according to Bentley 68 through 70 buses were 1600 cc
single port.

I know I'm going up against the experts so fire away.

&gt;A major reason that VW went to dual port was for fuel 
&gt;injection......And
&gt;smog requirements...
&gt;
&gt;I feel it was the worst move they made, I love single ports, and 
&gt;thats the
&gt;only thing I will build for a Bus, other than a type IV...

&gt;&gt; &gt; I believe VW went to dual port to meet emission standards.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Single port provides slightly higher low end torque because of 
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt; higher velocity of the air fuel mixture as it enters the 
&gt;cylinders.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think that VW had to go to dual port to flow enough mixture 
&gt;after the
&gt;&gt; displacement increase to 1600.  Keep in mind that the same basic 
&gt;head
&gt;&gt; design had been used from 1200 through 1500, and there wasn't 
&gt;enough metal
&gt;&gt; left to make the holes bigger.  Since they had to make a casting 
&gt;change
&gt;&gt; anyway, they went all the way to the dual port design.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Single port heads are not subject to
&gt;&gt; all the cracking that you find &gt; in dual port heads.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure that the cracking worries apply to the long-reach 
&gt;plug dual
&gt;&gt; port heads.  Anybody have any data on the long-reach heads?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Single port provides more engine access especially when changing
&gt;&gt; &gt; number 1 and 3 spark plugs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Very true.  They also make it easier to seat the spark plug boots. 
&gt; On
&gt;&gt; dual port tin, you have to be careful to get the boots behind the 
&gt;manifold
&gt;&gt; nuts.
