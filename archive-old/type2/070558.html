Subject: removing cabinets

I am having a bad time trying to get my main cabinet, the one with 
the sink out of my 79 westfalia. I think I have all the bolts but I 
cant seem to get to the area inside the bus where the sink drains 
outside of the bus. There is a piece of board in the way that moves 
up slightly but not enough to see how to remove the drain. Anyone 
know a good way to get them out?

thanks.
todd.
