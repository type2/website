Subject: sump plate bolts stripped?

------=_NextPart_000_0017_01C18886.31CB8060
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

1975 bus, 1800

My sump plate, put on by whoever took it off last before i bought it, =
was put back on without the sealing washers... the result was that both =
bolts (little 10mm head m6 bolts i think) came off with aluminum in the =
threads... so the whole actual point of this message is to get =
reccomendations as to fixes - should i go with inserts (if so, where can =
i find ones that small) or should i put some studs in and fasten the =
plate on with nuts?

any ideas?

thanks!!

bill martin
