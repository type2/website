Subject: Swepco

I found some info in the archives about Swepco 201 tranny fluid and it was
left a hanging thread.

Hitting the search engines I found this:

http://www.blueglue_dot_com/archives/vintagvw/mhonarc/2001/10/msg00856.html

&gt; OK... i went throught this in the spring. Here's what I found out.... GL5
&gt; rated lube WAS a problem. It WOULD damage the brass syncros. But if the lube
&gt; also
&gt; has a MT-1 rating it is now SAFE to use.
&gt; 
&gt; So... GL5 with a MT-1 rating is perfectly fine to use in your VW transaxle.
&gt; Most major brands (valvoline,pennzoil,castrol....) are all now GL5/MT1 rated.
&gt; Personally I use SWEPCO 201, it a very highly refined organic lube and the
&gt; &quot;Hot Ticket&quot; with the Porsfhe crowd.

What is MT1 mean and does anyone know for sure if this is safe to use now?
