Thanks to all that replied to my querry on who was going. We'll be there on
Friday night....I don't know how long it will take us to get to North Adams
as there is no direct route from the eastern part of Mass..and besides we
have a high drag coefficient on this trip .... namely a canoe strapped to
the roof!

See you there!
