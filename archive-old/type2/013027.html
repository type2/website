Hello Jason,

I have had the same problems with rust forming under
window rubbers. It is possible the remove the window
rubbers without destroying them but it can be
difficult. In my experience, I have not found an easy
way to go about it. I tried to remove windows by using
a screw driver to pry the lip of the rubber in the
inside of the bus and work my  way around the glass
until the entire lip of the ruber was pushed under the
tounge of metal so the window would pop out. In doing
this, it is verry easy to scar the rubber and THE
GLASS. Please don't try this method. I have heard of
inserting a string coated in silicon under the rubber
and sliding ti around the window while working the lip
of the rubber off the metal. I have never tried it but
I should have.

I also came to a realization about rust under window
rubbers. Why is it forming there? Why is moisture
hiding in those areas? I personally believe that
significant rust under a rubber is a possible sign
that the window rubber needs to be replaced. Granted
that there are some areas that will rust no matter how
good the rubber is.

I have bought all new window rubbers for mine. I had
to save my money for a long while though. I hope your
window rubbers are not as bad as mine were.:0/ Because
of their condition, I was forced to remove the rest of
the rubbers by sliding a razor blade under the glass
until I cut the rubber in two and the glass poped (or
fell ;) out. Good Luck saving them!

Have a good day!

&gt; Which brings me to another question - is it possible
&gt; to take out windows
&gt; without destroying the seals? There are a few spots
&gt; of rust coming through
&gt; which will require the windows out to be treated
&gt; properly, before I get
&gt; started I need to know whether to order new window
&gt; seals or not.
