Subject: Re: [T2] High oil temps

Those flaps are darn near unobtanium. Richard has instructions on making new
gaskets here: http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Heating.html

Could we make new flaps? I think so. Aluminum roofing flash should be about
the right thickness for the flaps (covers shouldn't be too difficult
anyway). They're just squares of metal with tabs wrapped around pins that
run through holes in the fan shroud.

I picked up a full set (with non-functional thermostat) at the junkyard
yesterday so this is a great time to take some measurements. I'll post when
I do...
