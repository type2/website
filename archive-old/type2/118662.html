Actually, as far as I know, there's no *mechanical* difference it the
longblock itself between a California and Federal engines of the same year.
Everything that has to do with making an engine Fed or Cal relates to stuff
that hangs off the longblock and lives around the engine in the engine
compartment.  Things like exhaust components, FI elements, distributor and
supporting electronics and the wiring harness.  You pretty much have to look
at these elements to make an accurate determination.

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; &gt;One of the first things you might do is check and see what elements of a
&gt; &gt;&quot;California&quot; engine you have; things tend to wander off over time.
&gt;
&gt; Another way to tell if your engine is 78, 79, Cal, or Fed is to check the
&gt; engine number on the case.  For a while I thought I had a true 79 Fed
&gt; engine, but it turns out that a 79 Fed fan shroud was put on a 78 engine
&gt; somewhere in my Bus's life.  IIRC, the case number is forward (FIF) of the
&gt; fan shroud, on the case, near the distributor, facing up (not back).  If
the
&gt; case number does not match the fan shroud number, go with the case number
&gt; and make the necessary modifications to get it correct.
