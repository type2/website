&gt; If Bentley lists a wear limit on the endplay, then is reseting it

This sure isn't gospel, but here are my thought on it. If movement of
the crank is bad (read more binding on rod bearings &amp; wrist pins) then
taking up some slack created by worn parts should be acceptable. I
have not seen mention in any of the books I have come across that have
said that after innitial assembly, not to reset endplay, but there are
published specs for the 3 spacers &amp; what size they are made in.
Sooooo, as long as we don't exceed the 3 largest spacers all should be
okee dokee. Since excessive endplay usually indicated a well worn
engine I would say it's just a band-aid for one that needs attention,
but you know how us bus people are :)
