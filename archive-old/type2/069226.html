Subject: Re: 6 cyl Porsche in 1980 Westy?

Kit/Stuart &lt;shabel_at_ecentral_dot_com&gt; posted to ask about the feasability of
a six cylinder Porsche engine in a 1980 Vanagon.

I replied....

Yes this is feasable. Someone has done this in the UK and it works well.
This bus turns up at quite a few of the VW shows.

I've no idea what the instalation problems are, just know it can be done.

I beleive that the engine comes up higher than standard so pokes through
the access hatch, requiring a raised floor in the luggage area.
