What are they talking about &quot;drive line&quot;?? I had no probs getting my buddies
bus back from KS to VA on a tow dolly.

Subject: [T2] towing question


I need to tow a 74 bus from Ohio to NC. Assuming I have no
special equipment, which I don't, what is the best way to do
it? I called a rental place, and they said a tow dolly couldn't
be used because the &quot;driveline is too hard to disconnect&quot;. They
suggested a trailer (all 4 wheels off the ground). Yea, nay, bogus,
or right on?

thanks...
