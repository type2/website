&gt;Thanks for all the cool info Ron. I could have gone out and  
&gt;read my manuals and stickers, but you saved me the trouble.  :-)
&gt;But something about the above two statements doesn't seem quite 
&gt;right unless YOU are the &quot;P.O.&quot; who installed the Dometic a la 
&gt;Salvador Dali, (or unless you were spending time and money messing 
&gt;with Koolatron while driving around with an unused propane 'fridge 
&gt;already installed in your bus?) 
&gt;
&gt;Did I miss something? 
&gt;Care to come clean on that count, or right the record for us? ;-&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again for the info,

Well, since the Koolatron fridge doesn't get very cold, I mounted 
it INSIDE of the Dometic fridge to aid in its cooling capacity. :)

Seriously, I suppose I should read my outgoing messages more 
carefully before I hit &quot;send.&quot;  I can see the confusion.  These 
were 2 different '77 Westies.  The one that I had put the Koolatron 
in was my daily driver that I sold quite some time ago, not the 
same one that I recently sold that the P.O. had &quot;Dali-ized.&quot;
