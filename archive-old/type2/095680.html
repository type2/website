Subject: Fuel Pump, do I need one?

A question for the wise,
     I have a 74' bus, with a carbureted 2 liter 79' engine in it.  Somebody 
has mounted a fuel pump on the top of the engine.  Do I really need a fuel 
pump?  I thought the carbs were fed by gravity?  Hence, the never ending 
fires in the engine bay if something goes wrong.  It's kind of in the way of 
putting an air cleaner in there too.  Of course, so is the carb linkage.  I 
got an air cleaner that was originally for a 74' not knowing I had a 79' 
engine, can I make that work anyway?  the bus runs great as is with the fuel 
pump on it, incidentally.

Here's some pictures, the one on the tip right of this page is the fuel 
pump.  Click the little picture to see the bigger version of the picture:

Thanks,
Jay
