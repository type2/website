&gt; I like the numbers that Bob was quoting there from the melling pump. Are
&gt; they not both 30mm pumps? The Schadek and the Melling that is? This motor

&gt; iron and theoretically could expand at a different rate than the case...

one thing I mentioned but I think needs to be emphisised is that the pump
I got from melling was honed to spec before being used.  I truely believe
that this step was a major part of how well it pumps
