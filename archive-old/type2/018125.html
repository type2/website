&gt; However, wouldn't the noise be a problem on a campground unless you are
&gt; alone on the whole place? Don't you go to the campground/nature to
&gt; experience the silence and the sounds of birds, bees and wolves howling in
&gt; the night? And what would your camping neighbours think about the sound of
&gt; this system?

          I guess you've never been in a US &quot;campground&quot;  --- every RV has an
airconditioner, running non-stop. Not only that, but most of them put up &quot;yard
lights&quot;, some of the very bright security lamp type, some put up a string of bright
colored lights all around the perimeter of their area.  Major PITA, but that's the
way it is. I've thought of requesting park officials to outlaw lights after 10PM, as
they do noise (but they don't consider AC noise to be &quot;noise&quot;) , but I'm sure that's
pretty hopeless.
        Of course, there are plenty of campgrounds which are tent-only, and RV's are
banned, but then, so are VW buses.
