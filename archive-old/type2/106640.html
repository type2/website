Subject: Kelley Park

I went to Kelley Park in San Jose for the swap meet and saw some nice split
busses on display. Nothing older than 67 was allowed inside this year. It
rained most of the day but I got some nice photos during a break in the
rain.

I'm running out of disk space so take a look before I take the pictures
down:

If anyone wants a larger photo of any bus, I still have the 1280x960 JPEG
images in my camera that I can email to you.
