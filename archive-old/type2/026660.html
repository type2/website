Hi,

This is my first post to this list, so I hope it works.  I've been lurking
for a few weeks and been think'n about replying to a few postings, but
worried about getting too wrapped up in it.  Oh well, gotta follow your
passion.  Probably turn into a regular poster.

Regarding the steel vs. plastic headlamp rings thread awhile back, I've
always thought that the original older Hella rings were made out of chrome
plated brass.  They're heavier and softer than steel rings and a magnet
won't stick to them.  On the inside, where the chrome plating doesn't quite
cover, you can see a shiny brass color.  After the trim rings were stolen
off my bug a few years ago (a funny story about that), I couldn't find them
anywhere.  The suppliers thought the brass idea was nuts.  So I searched
through the salvage yard with a magnet.  Most were plastic or steel, but I
did find them eventually and had them re-plated.  They hold up a heck of a
lot better from rust and look better than the plastic ones.

Can anyone verify this brass idea?  If not brass, what are they made of?
