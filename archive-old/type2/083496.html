Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Modern Brake Switch

That's always been my tailgating strategy no matter what 
vehicle I happen to be driving. That and a nice menacing 
glare into the rear view mirror. If they persist I give 
a little tap of the brakes to flash the brakelights. On 
my motorcycle, I have the light switch on the rear brake 
pedal adjusted so the light activates well before any 
braking occurs.

&gt; 
&gt; When I get a tailgaiter who refuses to pass me I simply slow down to
&gt; somewhere around 15 mph below speed limit. This really frustrates them and
&gt; they then figure out some creative way to pass me. Sometimes it is even by
&gt; moving left and  into the passing lane...

&gt; 
&gt; Several lifetimes ago, when I was driving trucks for Ma Bell, I found a
&gt; simple solution for dealing with tailgating drivers [especially on the
&gt; freeway].  Works just fine with your VW bus, too, and no modifications to
&gt; the vehicle are needed.
&gt; 
&gt; Pull out the 4-way/emergency flasher switch and let it cycle 2 or 3 times.
&gt; The offending party invariably backs off smartly, apparently perceiving the
&gt; flashing lights as brake lights.
&gt; 
&gt; If he/she returns to harass your bumper, repeat the procedure but try to
&gt; randomize the flashes by manipulating the switch.  Be creative, it's your
&gt; life and property that are threatened by that insensitive, unthinking,
&gt; jerk.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Modern&quot; drivers are programmed to reduce speed and pay attention [albeit
&gt; briefly] in response to flashing lights in their face.  It's a classic
&gt; involuntary response [Pavlov's dog comes to mind].  Feel free to manipulate
&gt; that response to your advantage.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;The deficiency here is not in the design of the bus, it's with the driver
&gt; of the vehicle following. There are very few things one can do to a bus to
&gt; rectify the problem in someone else's vehicle.&lt;&lt;
