To the group:

For those of you who are  building  or rebuilding engines you might be
interested in a Compression Ratio Calculator that Ron Van Ness and Myself
put  together.  There are some  quickie calculators built in also.  The
direct URL is  http://type2_dot_com/rvanness/deck.htm  It may also be  acquired
by going through www.type2_dot_com  (Ness-Tek button) .  The only
disadvantage  is that you must have Excel 97 or better as I don't believe
Excel is backwards compatible.

Enjoy,

Dale Mueller
