Subject: Ha! this is my week.

Hrmph.

well, Ichigo made it to and from work.

But on the way, the gen light flashed at me twice. for a split second each
time. Checked belt tension when I got to the shop, AOK.

Played witht he clutch, found nothing wrong cable or linkage wize.  Feels
like the same damn thing as last time a plate lost it's pressure, just not
quite as bad.

On the way hope, I hit the interstae (about 5 miles from the shop), and
vwalah.  The SECOND I came off the onramp, the damn GEN light glades at
me.  whoa...says I, and pulled over, and killed it quick.

Popped out, opend the decklid half hoping for a busted fan belt...Nothing.
Tension is fine, belt is solid, so I started checking connections fromt he
alternator and regulator.

all fine.  Sh!t say I.  Crank her up, go back and look again.  Looks fine.
Odd sorta noise, though.  Grab te throttle, and rev it a bit.  ALet it
settle at about 2 grand, and I hear this naaasty grrring.  Damn.  Alt
died, and maybe a bearing too.

I guess it could be a tossed piece of commutor, or a lost brush.  guess I
get to learn how to rebuild a 74 bug alternator...(Bosch 4 wire, ext reg)

But first, I haveta fix mums bus.  Then put that shift coupliong on the
66, and drive it. (the one with less non-obvious probelms get my attention
first...except moms bus, that is first priority, since I cant get her
$#^%*^%^^_at_#$%$%&amp;*( jetta fixed..)

and, for those that read about moms bus....It has a pertronix in it,
(which COULD be bad...) so I'm not gonna run out (30 miles) and check on
her points...:)

thanks folks....david
