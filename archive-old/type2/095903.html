Subject: Wipers and voltage meter

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C25FCA.9A1E3A60

Hello All,

It has been a while since I have posted. (Pesky cross-country road trips =
:) Way to much happened to even try to write about it all.)
Had an amazing time and am now living in Chapel Hill, NC. (if anybody in =
the area wants to get together email me)

Well yesterday I went to fix my horn, and I did. About an hour later I ha=
d to leave to go pick some people up and it was raining and the windshiel=
d wipers wouldn't work. They worked before I fixed the horn! And now the =
horn wasn't working again either. Had to take my housemates terrible car.=
 Later I went to have a look at it. The fuse for the wipers would blow as=
 soon as I would try to turn them on. Took apart the steering wheel again=
 to inspect. Looks ok to me. Followed the wires and took down the fuse bo=
x. Looks ok to me. Is there someway I can at least narrow down the proble=
m by measuring certain points with a voltage meter? If so are there any s=
uggestions as to where to take the readings? The fuse wasn't blown for th=
e horn. Followed the wires and played with em a little and now it works a=
gain! =20

And it has been raining often enough and randomly enough around here that=
 I can't take the bus far without working wipers. Any help would be great=
ly appreciated. =20

Peace,
Kyle
