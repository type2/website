Subject: Re: [T2] engine door seal

What I got from Bus Depot looks like the '2nd Best' seal in your  pictures.  Doesn't look anything like the original.  And your  pics make it look like the seal is glued to the body rather than the  door.  Is that correct?  Thanks...KR

&gt;Hey,  Guys. I just got a new seal for my engine compartment door. Haven't had  one on it since I got the bus. Question is: which way does it go? I  tried it with the thicker part toward the engine and it doesn't seem to  fit. Does the thinner side go to the back and the thicker side fits  around the outside of the door? Also, what would be the best glue to  use on it? I'm thinking this will keep the engine compartment cooler.  Thanks...KR

See my photos for help:

Use weatherstrip adhesive.
