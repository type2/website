Subject: 82: FI and wiring...

Ok.

80-82 AFC wiring diagram, Bentley for 80-82 Aircooled and Diesel. Part
1... (non cal, btw)

Pin 10 on the ECU plug has a wire running to pin 88a on the double relay.
88a also has a wire running to 39 on the intake air sensor.  diagram shows
2 wires connecting to 88a on the double relay.  (other places it showes
the same type of connection, with two wires, have two wire on the bus)

There is only one wire connected to 88a, and I get continuity between 88a
and 39, but NOT between 88a and 10, NOR between 39 and 10.

AFAI can tell, there is either not supposed to be a wire here, though the
diagram shows one, or there is a connection for it sindie the harness that
is broken.  I am about to diassemble the plug at the ECU end, and see if
anything is obvious there.

Next step will be to run a jumperwire between 88a and 10, and see if I get
voltage at 10 then. (presently do not, when the key is on...)

If anybody sees a problem doing this, LET ME KNOW!:)  Quickly, even...:)

thanks...david
