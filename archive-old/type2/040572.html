Subject: fuel venting

Hi guys,
I am trying to establish standard fuel tank venting. the PO used a unique
venting device consisting of a 4mm screw into the tee junction above the
rear of the engine.
I have connected through to the charcoal cannister top right hand nipple and
from the lower right hand nipple to the air filter housing but the left hand
nipple on the canister? I thought it went to the fan housing but I cant find
where.
Can anyone enlighten me?

Thanks
