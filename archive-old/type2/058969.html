I just got this info from Miguel.  You get your choice of solid or hyraulic
lifters for same price.

They sell a complete turnkey 34-pict3 engine for $1700, so the FI system is
right at about $1100 more (which implies the value of the new bosche FI
system is around $1250 considering the cost of a 34-pict3).

Hello Stephen:

I am glad you are interested in an engine. We sell them for $980.00 for
both solid, and hydraulic lifters. We can deliver them to the trucking
company tommorow. The carge for shipping is 178.38 for one, and 326.40 for
two, and the rates go down as you ship more units.

We do not sell the system by itself because you need a long-block with
hydraulic lifters for it.. We sell complete engines with the fuel injection
system, and the computer. They cost $2,850.00. 

Please let me know if you have any other questions,

Friendly Regards,

Miguel Padres
