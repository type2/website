&gt;In bugs with a seat belt warning buzzer, there is a &quot;key in ignition&quot;

75 has a buzzer but in 75 models it is &quot;looking&quot; for a ground. In this case 
you would need a relay.

It works without a relay in my 77 since the buzzer was &quot;looking&quot; for 12 
volts. I run my CD player directly off the the key buzzer wire left dangling 
by the PO(no relay needed).
