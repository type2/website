Has anyone experience of reversing the two multi connector plugs that attach to the fuel injector (double) relay?

--DON'T ever do this, one relay contains hot voltage from the battery and the other direct wiring to the fuel injection computer. You may have damaged something, you may not have. You'll have to see how the bus runs and ask more specific question of the list.

the two plugs are physically identical,

--Don't let that fool you.
