Steve-
With all due respect.  I don't think your &quot;snip&quot; adds anything to the debate.
My point, to paraphrase, busses overheat if you push them too hard and it has 
serious impacts on longevity/reliability.  Therefore, quantify how hard you 
are pushing with instrumentation.
Mr. Bulleys, again to paraphrase, busses overheat if you push them too hard 
and it has serious impacts on longevity/reliability.  Therefore use &quot;common 
sense&quot; and don't push too hard.

You seem to be saying with your with your third hand testimonial that it will 
break when it breaks regardless of what you do. 

This is the third time to my knowledge that this issue has come up.  It seems 
pretty obvious to me that consensus opinion is that if you push too hard you 
will have problems, either with shortened engine life or worse.  I'm sure 
that with practice and the right attitude and temperament that you can avoid 
pushing &quot;too hard&quot;.  I prefer to look at a properly installed accurate gauge.
