Subject: RE: [T2] Seats from Vanagon in Late Bay

&gt;From: &quot;Mike's Bus&quot;

&gt;I have '78 &quot;westfakia&quot; &gt;
&gt;My bus was originally a &quot;deluxe&quot; so I have them there &quot;air channels&quot; on my
&gt;doors, so I had to remove the &quot;out side&quot; arm rest on each side...


&gt;and a beer... bus work always goes better with a beer...


I can agree with you there that Bus work and beer go well together. But the 
air channel? On the door? I thought those were on the earlier models.
