Subject: Re: [T2] Advice requested....'81 AdventureWagen

Our neighbor is asking
&gt;$4,000; I'm wondering if this is a reasonable price, and if not what you'd
&gt;recommend we offer

If it's in as good of condition as you say it's probably worth that to 
someone. Personally I would offer 3000 for it.

&gt;In searching for someone to inspect it, I got some disturbing feedback
&gt;yesterday morning from Frank's Automotive, a local foreign vehicle repair
&gt;shop. The manager pretty strongly warned me against purchasing an '81 
&gt;model,
&gt;due to its aircooled, underpowered nature.

I bought an aircooled Vanagon specifically because i wanted the aircooled 
engine. The water boxes are much more expensive to work on and fix. My 
mechanic says they are pretty much junk. With a 2L type 4 engine, the 
Vanagon isn't as underpowered as you are probably thinking. I'm happy with 
how much power my Vanagon has.

&gt;Thoughts? And while I'm at it, one other thing I'm wondering about....due
&gt;both to the vehicle's height, its underpoweredness and its high center of
&gt;gravity, how scary is it to drive in a crosswind? A friend with a Westfalia
&gt;(popup top) had this concern.

Yea the height of a hightop can be a problem, you won't be able to park in 
many parking garages etc. Not sure if it would handle worst than a regular 
westy. My Vanagon handles alot better than my 71.
