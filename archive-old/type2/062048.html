Re:  your comments regarding a possible trip to Baja

Might well be interested in this trip -

If the fish aren't biting we could just sit around on our duffs and drink a
few Dos Equus - 

 - and I may even have a bus by then - After being &quot;re-engineered 4 mos ago,
my (financial) prospects are improving!  - Start work tomorrow on new job
with local hi-tech company.

BTW - - a big roger that on your comments regarding ugly Americans in
Canada.  I traveled all over the world when I was in the Army  -  and in 7.5
years learned basically two things:

        1)  You seen (and been up to your neck in) one rice paddy, you seen
'em all.

        2)  Never underestimate the capacity of your fellow Americans to
offend the locals.  

In most cases, there are only a few such offenders, but they get remembered
- - for sure - while the rest of us - who smile, try our best to be pleasant,
etc etc  - often in the face of local scams and con games are quickly
forgotten.  I found, like you did, that if you were consistently pleasant,
dressed low key and generally maintained a low profile - people would often
mistake you for a local or for someone from somewhere else besides the US.

In this country, we have had the good fortune to be blessed (or cursed) with
material weath that is far beyond the dreams of probably 95% of the world's
population.  Conspicuous display of same by many folks (60' Winnabago's ??)
coupled with manners that my mother would have smacked me up beside the head
for -  is doubtless offensive.  

But all the same, many of the same troops who got totally smashed on payday
night and maybe thrown in whatever passed for the local jail - were first in
line to generously donate their time and money to support projects to aid
local schools, orphanages, etc. etc.

Despite the shortcomings of many of our fellow citizens, I remain proud to
be an American and wouldn't want to live anywhere else.       

keep smiling - - :-)
