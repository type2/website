Subject: Re: [T2] Emissions Test Maryland 79 Bus

In a message dated 9/5/06 10:19:02 PM, accessys_at_smart_dot_net writes:


&gt; Are you aware of Maryland's 'Historic' plate category?  Your 79
&gt; &gt; vehicle is 25+ years old and should qualify.  You would not be subject to
&gt; &gt; emissions testing, IIRC.
&gt;
&gt; limited to 5,000 miles a year.
&gt;

Not that I'm recommending it, but we're talking about a very
mechanical system that responds well to having a cable dis-
connected for long service intervals... Wink, wink, nudge, nudge... ;-)
