Hi Volks!

Mailed to Type2 List and Bus Depot.

The Bus Depot wrote:
&gt; These are brand new, genuine Volkswagen, complete front doors for a '69-79
&gt; bus. Coming from Europe but actually made in Volkswagen's Brazilian factory.

I'm not a prospective buyer, but I have two questions nonetheless.

1. Which model exactly?  '69-'73 didn't have the door locking pin
   hole in the rear lower corner of the window, and '77 (I think)
   to '79 had different hinges.  I thisk there were such things
   as adapters for new doors to old hinges, or vice versa,
   though.
2. Are these really the European style?  Mexican and Brazilian
   Baywindow Buses I've seen have a ridge embossed a short way
   above the lower edge of the door skin.  You can faintly make it
   out on VW do Brazil's home page:
   http://www.vw_dot_com.br/pager.phtml?id=21&amp;par=32
   as well as on VW de Mexico's home page:
   http://www.vw_dot_com.mx/salaexhibicion/default.asp?ida=8&amp;idv=17

Ron: Please do not regard this as an attack against you or
your business.  I think it's in both your and your customers'
interest to know what they're about to buy -- because, 
judging from myself, I'd be quite disappointed to have paid
$500 for a pair of doors that don't match the specs of my
bus, and I think you'll want to sell them what they expect.

In other words: No offence meant!

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
