Subject: Re: What's in a name

i have often wondered where the names come from!? especially since mine
was a secret for the first few weeks. i have the kreeper by the way. it
is my three year old son's favorite scooby doo episode and then i
thought what the heck its slow too and then a friend added (who has
rescued me twice before my rebuild) that i would be spending a lot of
time on a creeper!! ha ha very funny! anyway thats where mine came from.
its my  ca license plate too so you all can spot me rather easily!!
