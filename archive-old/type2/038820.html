This is true, but there are some pretty serious
differences between a circular saw and a Dremel;-);
it's kind of like comparing apples and oranges... The
saw has a base-plate that not only acts as a guide,
but a shield, as well (in case a tooth, or wood
fragments go flying). Also, a saw blade is going to be
a wee bit harder to shatter than a cut-off wheel!

And the biggest difference is in how they are used...
when you use the Dremel, you have a tendency to look
straight down on the cutting wheel/attachment so that
you can see what you're doing (not the smartest thing
to do, but it happens), and there is *nothing* between
that wheel and your eyes/face.... if it shatters,
there's nothing to stop the fragments from doing you
some real damage.


I don't shy away from power tools, as I always take
appropriate measures to protect myself. But using the
cut-off wheel on my Dremel scares the crap out of me,
no matter what I use for protection. This comes from
experience; I've had too many of those wheels come
apart and go flying...and yes, I've had them bounce
off my goggles, leaving nasty dents as they go!

I'm not saying don't use the Dremel; just remember
that it's not the right tool for the job, and above
all...BE CAREFUL.


I was once cutting a piece of aluminum with a jig-saw,
when the blade snapped, sending shards of aluminum all
over hell's-half-acre. One of the pieces bounced off
of my face, inside of my safety-glasses, off the lense
(of the glasses), and into my eye. Yep, it *was* going
that fast, and that's why I now wear well-fitting
goggles, instead of safety glasses.

I spent a total of four hours in two emergency rooms
(seperate visits to seperate hospitals) that night,
while they flushed my eye with *ten* liters of saline.
Anyone have any idea how hard it is to keep your eye
open, while saline gushes over it???? It sucks, I
assure you.

Does that story sound implausible? Sure it does...but
it happened. I also shot myself in the eye with a bb
gun when I was a kid (ricochet) and caught the bb in
my eyelid...again, implausible, but true.


So, like I said, be careful....your eyes have almost
*no* ability to heal themselves from injury; once the
damage is done, it's usually permanent (I can still
hear the nurse chanting that like a Mantra, even after
4 years;-).
