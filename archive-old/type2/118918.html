Subject: Starter Relay

I caught a few messages on the starter relay, and just want to give my
thoughts.

I think the starter relay is just a patch-solution for worn out wires,
connectors and electrical gizmos.  Ideally, if you can I'd run a new and
thicker guage wire in place of the old one then you should get much better
results.

In my case I just cut off the connector, put on a new one and have been
starting happily for quite some time.


Best regards and Happy New Years,
Shawn.
