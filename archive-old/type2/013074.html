&gt; Curious if there is anyone who has seen or knows of a place to find a spare
&gt; tire for a bus that is very narrow like a donut tire.  I took my big spare
&gt; off the front of my bus because I wanted the emblem not a tire up there but
&gt; I also don't want it in the spare tire place in the back of the bus taking
&gt; up room, what I want is the tire under the Z bed couch,  or I could put a
&gt; narrow tire in the storage compartment above the drivers head.
&gt; 
&gt; Where do I get one of these?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
