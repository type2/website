Subject: keep burning valves every 6000 miles

&gt;snip...
&gt;In case anyone hasn't been following my ongoing saga all summer, I am
&gt;doing all this in an attempt to figure out why I have been burning
&gt;exhaust valves every 6k miles or so.  After installing new heads this
&gt;spring, I put a cylinder h
snip...

Hello,

please forgive me if you have already had these suggestions.

-if you have fuel injection, have you had your fuel injectors cleaned and
tested for pattern and volume; a low flow injector makes for a lean and very
hot combustion mix

-are you sure the head rebuilder really knows his stuff? no matter what, you
always throw away the exhaust valves and exhaust guides and install new
valves and new guides and properly fit the valves to the guides.

-If you have the correct head, do you have the special fuel injected engine
special &lt;Sodium filled&gt; exhaust valves. These valves have sodium metal in the
hollow (sealed) stem of the valve. The sodium metal transfers heat away from
the valve head (and seat) to along the stem where the oil spray from the
rocker arms can cool off the valve.

I know you have gone to great lengths to correctly set up the compression,
etc.

- a tight valve adjustment will cause the valve to hang open a little during
the power stroke causing severe overheating of the valve and the valve seat.
I have hydraulic lifters. I adjust brand new oil empty lifters at 0.006&quot;
intake and 0.008&quot; exhaust and I drive for a couple of hours and listen to the
clatter, then I know the lifters are pumped full of oil, then I adjust to
exactly zero lash and drive for a couple of hours, then I adjust to zero lash
and then one full turn in only.

- do you have some kind of weird camshaft that should be for racing engines
only?

-do you have some weird kind of extra-lift rocker arms?

if you do have a weird cam or weird rockers, they could be holding the valve
open a much longer duration than the valve can stand (i.e. burn up every 6000
miles) . A valve has to touch very hard against the seat to allow the valve
to transfer heat to the head. And it has to seal very hard against the head
to keep it from getting any extra heat from the power stroke combustion. And
it has to stay closed long enough to cool off.

- have you checked your valve spring strength and length?  Loose weak valve
springs can allow the valves to float. That is:  at higher rpm's the camshaft
and rocker get in position to allow the valve spring to push the valve
closed, but the spring is weak and before the valve can actually close, the
engine crankshaft keeps rotating and the camshaft and rocker is in position
to open the valve for the next step in the 4 strokes. Let me try explaing
another way --That is: the rocker pushes against the valve and opens the
valve and leaves it hanging open and exposed within the cylinder, then the
rocker moves back, and quites pushing, to allow the spring to push the valve
closed; but the spring is not strong enough to close the valve fast enough
before the rocker starts to push the valve open. Imagine it like pushing a
kid on a swing. You push from the bottom of the swing. You push the kid up
and you let go and the kid goes up to the full swing height, but when the kid
reaches full height, and before the kid can swing back down to the bottom,
you run up real fast and push him again and etc. before he can swing down,
you push him up and he constantly goes full height but only falls back 1
foot. The valves float in limbo getting burned up. This valve float also
batters the camshaft, pushrod, rocker, rocker adjustment screw, valve stem
ends because instead of having the small 0.008&quot; gap (or the zero lash
hydraulic lifter) you have a big gap and instead of parts sliding against
each other, you get parts knocking against each other.

when you figure it out, we all want to know the problem and the solution, so
please post your story to the list.

thanks
