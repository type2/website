        Well, spent all day fixing snags on the bus .
Started at 6:00am by taking the l/h carb off and dismantling it.
The Contraption is my new 73 Westy.
I put a rebuild kit in it and set it up as per the Bentley.
Pull the r/h carb off and set the 0.004&quot; gap for the throttle valve to
venturi gap. I installed the carbs (in the rain) but was fairly sheltered
under the rear hatch!
        The engine still wouldn't accelerate without backfiring through the
tail pipe at idle (more like poping , not loud)
and through the carbs when accelerating.
         The German mech. I know who's going to do the safety check said it
could be exhaust leaks so attempted to pull the muffler but heck, its stuck!
Four nuts and washers off but won't break free.
           I was wondering if anyone could tell me if there is a sleeve from
the muffler to heater box joints?????

            I also pulled the right hand push rod tubes out as they are
leaking like a siv (sp?)
            Will do the left after the completion of the right so I have a
comparison.

            Scrapped about a pound of oily dirt off the engine and trans
while I was lying on my back.

            Just had a swim to cool off and its now raining like hell!
          Chow for now
