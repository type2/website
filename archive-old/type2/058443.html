I've looked thru the archives and can't find help on what I need.

1. Color code for a white 75 camper. I need to get a quart mixed up to touch
up some places on my bus. The paint place is good on having the mixing formula
if I know the color name or code.

2. The steering wheel bakelite is cracked at the edge of the left arm and the
central hub. I've seen the articles on restoring these wheels and filling big
cracks with an epoxy putty. The wheel seems to be strong in spite of this
crack. Is the structural integrity of the wheel still OK with the bakelite
cracked?

Thanks
