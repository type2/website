Subject: NEED good 2.0 sqaure port head core

Subject says it all, I need a PERFECT bare 2.0 liter square port core,
prefer an AMC head under 50k miles or so.

Will trade a PERFECT German round port core, and I do mean
perfect, for said square port, or will pay cash or make other trades.

I'm looking for a perfect core though folks, I mean no seat recession
plus NO CRACKS even the ones that don't matter down around the
guides.  The round port core I have to trade is like this, it is the nicest
round port 2.0 core I've seen in 20 or so heads, it has had the guides
removed but is a perfect candidate for rebuild/modification, I'm looking
for the same but in a square port.

I've got lots of square port cores with surface erosion or non-damaging
cracks deep around the exhaust guide bosses myself, I want one more
perfect one to have rebuilt.

Anyway, if you got something yell at me.
