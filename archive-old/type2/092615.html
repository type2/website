&gt;  now i have a pretty major oil leak from between the eng. and trans.

Be sure to polish the seal surface on the flywheel. It could also be 
leaking from the trans mainshaft seal.

&gt;  i also want to know how to check the end play while i have the flywheel 
&gt; off again.

No, you must check the end play before removing the flywheel, then remove 
it and measure the shims, then put in the proper shim calculated from the 
measurement.
