Subject: I believe!!!!!   (65 camper update)

in electricity!!!!!!!!

ive been converted.  i broke through.  i will no longer be afraid or confused
by wiring problems.   

just had to share that with you all.   anyway, the 65 camper now has  all
it's exterior lighting working correctly

well, i DROVE the beast today, and it was awful.   for the first mile, when i
got to a gas station to put air in the tires.     have you ever driven a bus
with no rear window?    the exhaust comes in the bus, i dont reccomend it.
  So i opened the safaris and drove in a wind tunnel.   should have brought
goggles.      sound of ripping from behind as the wind tore part of the
sagging and brush painted with brown house paintroof panelling off.

after the tires were properly inflated, it drove okay, though i was nervous
about the front tires, which show metal, popping.    actually went straight,
i spite of the bent tie rod (i bet a bunch of you are glad you dont live
anywhere near me, and wont meet this thing on the road.  oh dear.  no it is
not that bad.)

second stop - car wash.  i had previosly sprayed foamy engine brite on the
engine.   now i washed that puppy down.   the engine compartment paint is
actually very nice. (too bad about the rest of the bus)    much better  :)

third stop - Les Schwabb.  to get the good used tires i brought with me
mounted in the interest of safety.   you know, i just have to say im very
happy with them.  they are friendly and professional.  they have a spacious
and clean ladies room in which i proceeded to wash off the engine gook that
had jumped on me at the carwash.      they have  free popcorn and coffee in
the waiting area,   and they have the best deal in town.   (no connection
with them but a happy customer).

fourth stop - out of gas on the way home.   had to walk with the can to the
gas station, then hitched a ride back to the bus.   

home !  backed into the garage and pulled the motor and gas tank.   wait, not
so fast.  the top left bolt was a real pain,  but it's all out.    the tank
looks almost new.  nice primer grey, and clean inside.   wow.   i was
expecting guck.   all the fuel line was bad.   the sender has the rattle in
it, so ill assume it works.   the clutch looks new too.   the oil filter and
oil cooler mounted in front (FIF) of the fan has to go. 

tomorrow -
 reinstall tank and check sender by putting gas in the tank. new gas line
new trans boots and engine compartment seal
change oil seals, and switch to a stock oil cooler. add missing tin , the
frontmost piece 
put motor back in, and find a good muffler.
