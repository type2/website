Subject: brake booster and front panel ??

ok here's a question. is there a test that you can do on a brake booster 
that will tell if its bad or not? also why i am on the topic, exactly how 
does it work??? what does it hook up to and how should i check mine. i have 
a 72 westy.

also would a new front panel from a 72 NON westy fit right on my 72 westy. i 
would think so except that i recall another conversation sometime ago that 
said that the body of a westy was different from that of standard buses.

alright. thanks in advance
