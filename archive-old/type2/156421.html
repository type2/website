&gt; What size is the nut on the end of the rear wheel on my 78?  It's the

The nut is 46mm, but you don't have to remove it to take your drum off.
It is a composite drum, so the hub stays put.

It might be a bit tough to get the drum off, but apply penetrating oil and
wiggle it back and forth and it will eventually come off.

Put a thin film of anti-sieze on the mating surfaces when you put it back
on to make the job easier next time.
