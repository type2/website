Subject: [T2] 68 Oil Bath/AC Questions

Volks,

I am running a 1776 with a Weber progressive. Could I use the stock oil bath
air cleaner to vent the crankcase? I am running the Weber because I did not
want to cut the stand off for the Oil bath in order to squeeze in the Dual
Kadrons.

Also, can anyone suggest an AC kit? I already have the under dash AC and the
behind the head blowers. (Or whatever you call them (condensor?)) I also
have the 4 fan (looks like a radiator) that bolts in between the frame rails
below the floor. I want one of those spiffy 7 cylinder compressors with a
mounting kit for type I. I just don't want to have to purchase it with the
under dash unit. Also, the kit must be the new R134a stuff.

Has anyone done anything like this? Can anyone recommend a supplier for the
mounting brackets and compressor. Is there anything I may be missing.

TIA
