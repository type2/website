I freaked out the first time I saw what you described. Turned out to be only
water and carbon - mine evaporates quickly with no oily residue.

&gt; try checking the compression in all your cylinders to see their
&gt; condition.  Also look at your plugs to see if their fouled.

&gt; &gt; oh boy, I just know this is going to be bad...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I just caught it doing it this mornig, and I was scared this was it..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ive been noticing those little splotchy marks on the back window like
oil
&gt; &gt; had burned, and left residue on my window, and I was kinda hoping that
it
&gt; &gt; was just dripping on the tailpipe and coming up, but when I fired my 75
FI
&gt; &gt; up this morning, I threw on a white glove and stuck my hand in front of
the
&gt; &gt; exhaust.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; and oil oil oil was coming out.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What does it mean?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; its been running great lately to, and seemingly still is, but is this
&gt; &gt; something bad headed my way?
