&gt;Schwartze makes a good point that if the oil temp is lower it could be
&gt;because the oil is absorbing less heat, due to a lower rate of heat
&gt;absorbtion ( I can't think of the correct term here).  However, if the oil
&gt;has the ability to absorb heat quickly it also has the ability to dump
&gt;heat quickly, therefore showing a lower temp than an oil with a lower
&gt;absorbtion/dump rate.  Remember, the heat is lost throught the bottom of
&gt;the oil pan and the oil cooler, and an oil that moves heat better would in
&gt;fact operate at a lower temp, and the engine would also run cooler as
&gt;well.

I guess it would depend on where you are measuring it.  If it's after the
oil cooler, then I would assume lower temperature means it transfers heat
better.  If before the cooler, then I would assume lower temperature means
it doesn't transfer heat as well. My sender measures oil temp in the sump,
which is more or less before the cooler, so I'm still going with &quot;doesn't
transfer heat as well&quot;.  Of course, I'm not very confident in my
determination, and I'd love to be proven wrong.  :-)
