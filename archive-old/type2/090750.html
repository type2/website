Subject: openings in engine tin...

Too my never-ending bafflement, my 68 bus has been
'hybridized' over the years.

Besides the holes associated with the heat tubes
between the doghouse and heater boxes, my engine tin
has two matching smaller holes in the rear of the tin
(closest the bumper--behind and on either side of the
crankshaft pulley tin piece). 

The holes open vaguely to the muffler and the ground
below. Apparently, they were meant to channel rising
heat for some reason.

My air cleaner--which looks like it's from a 1500
bug-- doesn't have a corresponding hookup.

Shud I just plug 'em to keep muffler heat from being
sucked into the fan??? Or shud they be connected to
something somewhere?
