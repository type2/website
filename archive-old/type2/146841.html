Subject: Re: [T2] Friday: 46 mm socket and advance timing light

&gt; Has anyone tried the 46 mm socket from CIP?  Will it hold up to home 
&gt; mechanic use?

Why don't you pick one up from sears and if you break it, you'll get a 
replacement for free.

Speaking of which, my friends welded a craftsman socket to the end of a 
6 foot, 2&quot; diameter pipe.  They bent the pipe getting the wheel bolt off 
but the socket was undamaged.  On the opposite side of the 46mm they 
welded the socket for the clutch nut.

&gt; Any suggestions as to a decent advance timing light for not much more 
&gt; than HF used to sell them (about $30)?  Extra points for Canadian sources.

I believe that sears also sells these as well.

Mike
