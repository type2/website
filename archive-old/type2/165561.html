&gt; Going to the first site that came up on doing a google search on &quot;finned
&gt; tubing&quot;, this site http://www.fintube_dot_com/ has some really interesting stuff
&gt; that may work quite well. Also, you may be able to find the finned tubing in
&gt; some kind of salvage industrial heat exchanger. If it is steel, you can weld
&gt; it into rows with weldable u-bend steam pipe fittings available at any good
&gt; plumbing supply store or sweat solder copper fittings if it is copper
&gt; tubing.

If you look through pictures of cars of the early 20th century you'll find
a few that used finned tubing for a radiator, so the idea isn't brand new.
:)

The design goal of a radiator is to get the maximum heat exchange ability
in the smallest and least vulnerable package.  My feeling is that any
advantage to using finned tubing will be offset by the added size and
vulnerability of the system.
