&gt;Different thread: why was painting you bus root beer brown so popular in the
&gt;'70s?  same reason as cut wheel wells?  
*******

Root beer brown was THEE color in the 70's!!! Especially in SO.CAL!

Ford had just come out with a twinkly metal flake type paint for their 
trucks and EVERYBODY who was ANYBODY went for it as an after market 
gig! (Including my own self on my '65 slittie with the Super 1600 
Porsche)

GOD! I HATE that color now!

her re-done metal flake root beer brown!)
