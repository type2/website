Subject: goodies and my weekend (longish)

Hi all - just thought I'd let you know what I'd picked up from Lewis'
treasure trove (didn't want folks spending nights wondering what they
missed out on!).  I'm pretty poor, so MANY neat items have been passed
on... but I did pick up:
More manuals and repair guides for my library - a sealed (not for long!)
copy of the Bentley Bug 66 - 69, Clymer 61 - 79 Beetle shop manual, Haynes
1300 &amp; 1500 Beetle, and a neat little Clymer &quot;preview&quot; manual of the 1500
model. This car wasn't even sold in the US when the book came out! Lewis
saw how cool its neighbor was (that one had a section on VW industrial
engines) and refused to sell it to me. Ah well.
Also snagged a VDO tach, an SW oiltemp gauge and sender (set up for idiot
light use, which I don't like, but it will do for now), a VDO clock, a
nice little 2-holer box for the gauges and a cal-look seal for my
windshield, as everyone has convinced me of the troubles associated with
keeping my Delux Chrome seal.
I spent the afternoon redoing my dash today. The tach went into the spare
hole to the right of my speedo. Lewis mentioned that the PROPER way to do
this was to remove the instrument cluster, but I can hang offa the front
seat upside down and backwards and climb into the dash pretty good (college
girlfriend had one O those Batmobile-lookin'  early 60s Volvos - LOTS of
practice). Made a metal plate and it screwed right in, no troubles. Be VERY
careful when moving around all those wires under there! The dial is not as
large as my old tach, so it shows less  RPM fluctuation, but looks better
than the thing which used to sit up on the dash, so I guess all things are
a tradeoff. Next, I took all the *other* gauges off the dash (cylinder head
temp, ammeter, oil temp). I found that VW Bubble dashboards have the same
'grain' as those generic black videotape boxes, so I made a plastic blank
to fit where my radio used to be (burst into flames one day), cut two holes
into it, and mounted up the ammeter and the clock. Looks VERY nice. The
clock is powered by a  12v VCR battery, seperate from the car battery.  The
important stuff - oil and head temps - went into the little plastic box,
which is all that remains on the dash. I am amazed at the difference! Lewis
hisself hates gauges ('shorts looking for a home') and feels that 9 out of
10 are inaccurate, but I like having SOME idea what is going on back there!

 We would like to thank all the Listies who have responded to these posts -
Lewis is amazed anyone out there with a computer even CARES about old VW
parts, and I've had lots of fun digging through his stash. Feel free to
call Lewis about any part you haven't seen listed yet, we're still digging!
