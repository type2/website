&gt; I am once again thinking about tearing my bus a part and putting it back
&gt; together.  This is going to be a large and complicated project.   I
&gt; want to come up with some sort of plan.  Having never taken this kind of
&gt; project on before so I really don't know where to start.

&gt; Limits
&gt; Time and Money, while not limit less I want to do things right.

I think you would be better off just doing one section at a time so you
always have a bus that is close to ready if need be.  So many people get
&quot;burned out&quot; on such a large project once they get into it.  Having your bus
driveable from time to time will keep you motivated.

I'd start with the mechanicals, front end, brakes, rear trailing arms,
engine.  After the bus is mechanicaly &quot;freshened up&quot; proceed with the body.
If you can afford to, have a professional do it, if not, do it yourself in
stages.

The bodies on busses lend themselves well to sectional painting.  Do the
nose first as the front window rubber always needs replaced and the rust
repaired.  Do the side that needs the most work next and so on.

When your done, you will love your bus, but as you are working, take it out
from time to time to make sure your still traveling in the right direction.

Drive it, camp in it and love it.
