Subject: VW Parts

Dear VWphobes,

I have a container load of VW parts sourced over the years from around
Australia and including T2 mostly but also various beetle, T3 and other
pieces quality ranges from average to excellent condition but includes:
Barn doors,
Slide doors,
Panels,
Single cab ute dropside panel sets,
Assorted electrical..generators, manual and auto starter motors,
accessory cooling fans, wiper blades, interior trim panels
Doors complete with handles, glass,,etc
Glass for T2s, beetles, etc
External and internal sunvisors

And so forth.

Rather than sell parts individually I would like to find a buyer interested
in the entire lot.

Do you know of anyone interested in these parts.

Regards,

Bill Webb
