Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Pedal Travel Question

You should have about 1/2&quot; of play in the clutch before it begins to
engage.  I find the clutch to be fully engaged before it is halfway to the
floor.

&gt; I am thinking now that the pedal travel was designed for the pedal to not
&gt; go all the way to the sheetmetal so repeated full travel hits busted the
&gt; bolt.
&gt;
&gt; Wouldn't the pedal be designed to have a carpet and insulating pad under
&gt; it?  So having full travel to the sheetmetal is actually too far?
