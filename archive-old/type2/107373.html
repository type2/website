Subject: GENERATOR REMOVAL

Hello,

I recently posted a message about a strange occurance.
I have a 72 van and now have problems with either the battery not holding a
charge
or the generator is fried. Can the generator be removed without taking the
engine out?
I don't want the hassle of taking the entire engine out just to change the
generator.
First i am going to put the battery on a charger and see if it holds charge
then i can
rule out the battery if it holds the charge.but if it holds the charge i'm
gonna have
to change the generator, i have my old one from my other 72 van that the
engine got fried.
your replies are much appreciated.

Thanks,
Darren
