Subject: Re: electrical connector corrosion

On Wed, 7 Dec 2005, Dino sez:
&quot;Hello All,
,,,, problem with electrical connector corrosion.  ,,,snip,,,,
I live near the ocean; I'm surrounded by salt water so I'm always fighting
rust and corrosion. ,,,,

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
I live in a similar environment.....the winter salt belt of the Mid-West. I 
learned to use marine-grade connectors that are designed to seal out the 
corrosive agents.....water, salt, and air. I found some connection blocks 
that sealed out all the elements with a rubber membrane.......and I use 
Scotch. Super 33+ Vinyl Electrical Tape on everything.

If you have time you could do some research at this 
address:  http://www.boatus_dot_com/boattech/casey/05.htm

I'll summarize some of the goodies: Choose your wire carefully. Avoid solid 
wire on a boat or car. Wave-or motor-induced vibrations eventually fracture 
solid wire. Boat/car wiring must have the flexibility stranding provides. 
You could save a few dollars using type 2 wire, but a boat/car owner should 
use only the most flexible wire, called type 3.

The wire must be copper, but even copper corrodes in the marine 
environment, and corrosion is the primary cause of electrical failures on a 
boat. Plating each strand of the wire with a thin coat of tin (called 
tinning) dramatically improves corrosion resistance. The additional cost of 
tinned wire is nominal, the benefits substantial.

There is only one accepted field test for a crimp terminal   -  pull on it. 
Test every crimp terminal this way. Without using any tool, grip the 
terminal and the wire and try to separate them. If they come apart, the 
crimp was bad.

Some quotes from the site:

&quot;Adhesive-lined heat-shrink tubing is the marine electrician's secret 
weapon. Properly applied, this stuff will seal out 100 percent of the 
moisture in a splice. Additionally, it also makes it even harder to pull 
the splice apart. Beware of thin walled heat shrink tubing that doesn't 
come with an adhesive. These products will wick in moisture, and are easily 
damaged. &quot;

&quot;....don't recommend that you use electrical tape to seal wire connections. 
The glue used in electrical tape seems to melt in the marine environment, 
and using the proper connectors along with heat-shrink tubing will reduce 
the need for tape. However, if you need it for repairs, I recommend that 
you use 3M Super 33 tape. This product uses better adhesive, and the tape 
functions well in the cold and heat.&quot;

&quot;Make sure to slide the heat-shrink tubing over the wire before you insert 
the connection and crimp. You crimp twice, tug firmly, and then apply heat 
to the tubing after it's in place.&quot;
