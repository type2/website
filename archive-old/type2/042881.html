Subject: CDI noise

Hi,

I just installed a new tiger 581 on my 78 FI westfalia. It works fine 
but makes a high pitched squeal when the ignition is turned on. To 
anyone who has one of these installed, is this normal? This module was 
modified by Universal to accomodate the tach pulse requirements of the 
Bosch ECU so I have considered that this may be a factor but still have 
no experience with these units so I am clueless and slightly worried by 
this noise.

Bob
