I'd probably consider myself just as lucky.  I've lost an alternater 
belt, CV joint, headlight switch, windsheild wiper motor, but never 
points.  Never-the-less the appeal of electronic ignition lingers so 
I've been following this thread closely.

So now I have the following question... assuming that one does opt for 
electronic igntion, which is better - compufire of petronix?
