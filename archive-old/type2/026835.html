Hello:

Since I went through the front disc brake squeal episode a few weeks ago I 
thought I'd let you all know of a cheap source for brake shims.  The metal 
shims that are generally available for VW are pricey; about $7-$11 each.

I found a set of four shims in my Moss Motors catalog (a British car 
catalog, no flaming please!!!; http://www.mossmotors_dot_com that are $2.95 for 
the set.  They are made by Beck Arnley of fiber material (about like a heavy 
duty gasket) with a sticky back.  The Moss part number is 583-805.  The Beck 
Arnley item  number is 084-1122, if you buy from another source.  The shims 
fit perfectly without trimming on the back of the VW pads.

I ended up replacing my original new pads with another new set and used the 
shims.  It's been 3 days now and not a hint of squeal.  I'd been going batty 
trying to quiet down the front brakes with sanding, re-gluing, 
cleaning....etc.

Hope some of you can use this information.

Best regards,
