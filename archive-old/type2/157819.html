Subject: Re: [T2] no start after lubing distrib. with WD40

&lt;&lt;Oh, and I should clarify... The way he described the WD-40 use was to
free up the advance weights. That means he had to spray LOTS.&gt;&gt;

Maybe-- But I wasn't there to see how much he drowned the weights with
the WD-40.

Even if he dumped the whole can on the weights--it would still fire.

&lt;&lt;I've used it to dry a cap after an engine wash, but that's not what
was described.&gt;&gt;

It would fire with the WD-40 on the points.

Maybe they are fried and on the way out--who know's??

When I ran Enduro's I'd soak the points o my Triumph's, BSA's with
either WD-40 or LPS-1---

The engines would run under water without missing a beat.

I blast every vehicle I own with the stuff when the points, rotor, top
of the coil,all the wires, and cap are changed----always--

They always fire.

He's got some other ignition problems.
