Subject: Email Filtering: (Re: Content (or lack thereof)...PLEASE READ!)

&gt;        Perhaps I can offer a solution. Many email programs now offer
&gt;filtering, many more are following thier lead. Many of the serious fluff
&gt;posters can be identified. You probably see where I'm going by now. I
&gt;currently skim the list and stop to read topics that intrest me, from

Unix users can use elm's filter utility or procmail to weed out the &quot;crap&quot; -
my filter-rules file contains 160 delete directives!  I know I don't recieve
half the mail on this or the vintagvw list!

Eudora Pro has filtering capabilties too, but it actually has to bring the
message over the wire before it can filter it.   

I've been doing some research into running my own mailing list, and have
thus gained a much greater appreciation for whats involved.  Most people
don't realise all this stuff isn't _free_.

I know that if and when I host a mailing list, It will be much more strict
than we are now.
