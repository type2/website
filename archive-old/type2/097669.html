&gt; While it &quot;might&quot; have a 914 engine most likely it is just the pancake
&gt; which shares many of the same design features as the 914 engine. There
&gt; is most likely an easier way to check, but the way I know is that on
&gt; the heads where the intake runners connect to them. On the 914 head
&gt; there are only 3 studs to mount the runners to, the bus engine has 4.
&gt; Many people try to distinguish the upright engine (i.e. beetles &amp;
&gt; older busses) and the T4 (or T2) engine which has a fan on the end of
&gt; the crankshaft, this way.

Only the 2L 914 ( 4 cyl.) has a 3-bolt intake. 1.7L/ 1.8L is 4 bolts.
( The 2L 914-6 ( 6 cyl.) has 6-bolt intake manifold bolts :)
The easy difference is in the engine case- The 914 dipstick is on top
next to the breather and the bus-type oil filler location is a closed
casting.
The fan housing is also closed at the dipstick and won't work for bus.
