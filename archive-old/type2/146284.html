&gt; The only case I have seen where an older vehicle was not registered
&gt; under the year it was produced, was my current neighbors 4x4.  The previous
&gt; owner had completely restored it but replaced the engine and maybe some of
&gt; the drive train with a newer one.  Somehow, it was registered under a later
&gt; year because of this.  I can't remember the details but maybe this will
&gt; spark someone's memory?

   Not an older Landie?

I'm familiar with some tales of British cars languishing in showrooms
until sold...They then were registered as the year sold, rather than
under the manufactured year...i.e. a car built in say 1965 is regis-
tered as a '66...

OTOH, I've got a '66 MG Midget that fits into an envelope...Both
VINS (chassis and door jamb) were held on with screws and the
NJ title matches them...All it needs is a car to slip under them... ;-)
