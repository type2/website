Subject: Re: [T2] Head swapping question



&gt; &gt; The F.I. 2 liter engine has smaller valves to minimize (I think) the 
&gt; intake
&gt; &gt; pulses that would confuse the AFM. They also came with mild cams to help
&gt; &gt; the same problem.
&gt;
&gt;Correct, as stated in my original post. What I'm trying to determine is
&gt;whether or not this will have a detrimental effect when running with carbs.
&gt;

Sorry for the run around...

I have run dual 36mm Dells on 2.0 fuel injected heads with no problems. 
They won't make as much power as their larger valved cousins but they work. 
The biggest difference between the 914 and the bus was the compression 
ratio, valve size, and the head design was more efficient on the 914.

So there is no problem with running 2.0 F I heads with carbs - just won't 
be the barn stormer you might have in a lighter car with the different heads.

I got 25 mpg pulling a Hyundai loaded down when I drove my Type IV powered 
Beetle home from VA in 1995.
