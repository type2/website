Subject: FWD: Shift Rod Boots

Well, after numerous calls and emails, I have been unable to find the
shift rod boots for my bus.  Jim _at_ Old Volks Home sent the following
message.  Maybe some of the other retailers would be willing to share
some of the burden?
Forwarded Message as follows:

Hi Shawn -

Unfortunately, in their wisdom (or lack thereof), Volkswagen in Germany
discontinued this item about 3 years ago.  The original mfr has no
interest
in producing these and since VW owns that tooling, they wouldn't give me

the time of day.  I am looking into reproducing these (I have to make
10,000 pieces at one time), but it could be awhile getting the finances
up
for tooling and production.

End message
