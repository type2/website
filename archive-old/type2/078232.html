Subject: Re: [T2] speedo lube

I sent my BWM tach there and was very happy with the results.  They
charged ~$80.  I know that may other airheads have used the with good
results.

&gt; Now that I'm working on my 80 westy, I need to fix the odometer. I need the
&gt; little black drive gear. apparently they all crack, as I've seen several cracked
&gt; ones and no good ones in junkyard speedos. I believe that Wurth Products or some
&gt; other supplier may have these available.
&gt; Lacking that has anyone any experience with speedo repair shops? Palo Alto
&gt; speedometer is the only name I've heard. Has anyone used them?

&gt; Having gone that far though, you might as well rebuild

&gt; &gt; the damn thing.  I don't know what lube VW used on the main drive system of
&gt; &gt; the speedo, could be whale oil for all I know.
