&gt;can anyone give me any advice on fixing a whole in my pop-top?if anyone has
&gt;done this before please let me know.thank oyu for any help...

This is pretty easy.  I had to repair the lip of my 78, which had broken 
off over years of opening and closing.  All you need is some fiberglass 
sheets and epoxy resin (I got both at the local hardware store).  How big 
is the hole?
