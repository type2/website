enought of these stories so I hope this post can stimulate some more

My wife and I have been talking about living in a bus next fall in
Spain.  The &quot;too much stuff&quot; issues seems unlikely, given the limits on
airline luggage.  One big issue, on the face of it, is the question of
where to clean one's body.  It's less of an issue if one is camping;
where one is (1) expected to be somewhat unkempt, and (2) likely to find
oneself in campgrounds where there are facilities, at least some of the
time.  However, for my wife at least, this is to be a working trip; and,
moreover, we expect to be in more or less urban areas, however,
including Madrid, Granada, Girona.  If we stay in a city for a month or
more, I suspect it may be possible to join a gym, or make some
arrangements with an hostal/pension for facilities.

The other big issue, of course, is that I don't have a camperbus
anywhere in Europe.
