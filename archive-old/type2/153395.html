Subject: Re: [T2] Air cleaners &amp; thermostats

Phil asked:


Question 3: The two vacuum ports on top of the air filter. Which one (front 
 or back) plugs in the vacuum line running across the top of the engine bay ? 
 I know I should remember but I don't :-( 50/50 chance of getting this right 
 I suppose but since I'm e-mailing.

If you have two vacuum ports on top of your &quot;71 bus&quot; air cleaner....... you have a Ghia air cleaner!!

The bus air cleaner does not have vacuum ports. 

Look at the part number on the air inlet:
71 Bus:  
Knecht = 662/6 and on the top LB 662/1-504M1
Mann = 211 129 607 C and on the top 37 028 58 211

Late Ghia:
Knecht = 211 129 607 F
Mann = on top 37 028 58 261
