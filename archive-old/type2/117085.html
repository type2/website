Subject: key broke in ignition

It sounds like the screw driver will get you going for a shirt while. If
so, you're lucky.

It seems to me that worse comes to worse you could take the lock mechanism
apart piece by piece and try to get a good grip on the key.  In case you
didn't know there are instructions floating around the net explaining the
procedure.

- Shawn.
