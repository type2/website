Subject: Re: [T2] Re: SnakeOyls

Tim,

In closing I would like for you  to remove your blinder's and look to
the right as well as the left---

You defiantly have your opinion's just as I do---

With one large exception.

I was introduced to this product by an old timer, who had been twisting
wrench's, before I was a mere twinkle in my daddy's eye----

He finished his carrer working for Universal Oil Products labs here in
the Chcago area.

He passed on this information to me --I  disbelieved also---

I gave it a shot and it performed just as he claimed----

I always enjoyed paying attention to an older, much wiser, been there,
seen it, done it, kind of guy---

This is how one learns in life, and I did, I have, and still probably
will---

No hypothetical data, can ever replace experience----

Believe what you may---think what you may, but it is a fact of life,
that MMO is a fine product, which just happens to work very well, and
again, this is no infomercial--it is a reality, and it has performed
very well for me---

Just try the stuff for God's sake,and be a bit more open to suggestions,
than the Rock of Gibraltar--it just might work and shock the hell out of
you----Don't read the can though--it might cause coronary arrest 

Sometimes I believe you are stuck in the everglades, with 4 bald tire's,
no 4 wheel drive, and are just &quot;spinning&quot; your wheels.


Have fun----

Later,



Terry

 
E-mail message From Doktor=A0Tim  

Personal observations, and engine longevity is proof of the pudding, Mr.
Tim---- 

I disagree. You have no evidence at all that the snakeoyl had anything
to do with longevity. You just assume it so so you can think yourself
wise for spending the money on snakeoyl. 
The &quot;data&quot; plea seems to arise whenever the cat has got your tongue---(
here I go with the cat thing---) 
Most on this list will testify that I am rarely if every tongue tied.
Wrong again. 
Molecular analysis isn't needed here Tim--just plain common sense and
pure longevity figure's in this instance are adequate--- 
Don't need facts so don't need to listen to those with the most facts in
hand, the engineers who designed and manufactured the vehicle. So good
to know we have someone on the list to testify his subjective
experiences have more weight than the factory. 
Throwing data figure's is like pissing in the wind, if an actual real
world experience, isn't appreciated. 
No problem with anyone giving testimony of their experiences and
conclusions based upon subjective observations. It just can't replace
real data in a rational sense. 
If you interested in mileage figure's, and zero down time due to lack
engine failure's, attributed to the use of Marvel Mystery Oil, I have
plenty---- 
As I stated in my prior posting, I have been a believer, and user of
Marvel Mystery Oil for at least 35 year's, and never have had any lifter
failure, stuck rings, galling or excessive valve stem, or guide failure,
nor not one pounded out bearing in any engine I have ever owned--- 
Others who maintain their engines spec with no snakeoyl at all can
testify to the same great service. This would seem to back up the
factory advise as at least equivalent to your assumed beliefs. 
And I am a pedal to the metal kind of guy----not a tea totalling, stick
at 60 mph, mope---- life in the express lane is the way I drive--- 
I know, you believe you are invincible. 
The stuff works for me--and I'm happy I found it many moon's ago--it has
saved me money, aggravation, and down time. 
You believe it works for you, you don't know it works for you. There is
a big difference that you will never understand unless and until you
develop rational thought. 
And for that I'm happy, and I will continue appreciating the benefits of
it's fine lubricating qualities ---- 
Sell it to Marvel. They gladly accept unsolicited testimonials. 
This is not in any way shape or form a infomercial, by Ron Popeal,or
Dion Warwick--it is my own personal findings, using this product, for
long period of time---with superior results--that all. 
This is what you have said repeatedly to convince yourself that facts
are inferior to belief. This is the tech of claims and testimonials.
Repeat over and over until someone else believes it and you become
validated in your own personal reality. 
Please take a moment to read the side of the can of Marvel--it's
interesting and informative-- 
Sold you so it must be very convincing.
