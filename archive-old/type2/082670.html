 Don't know about the fuel pump, chrome trim, paint job, or gearbox but I do know that putting a bigger engine, if aircooled is you desire, could be rather expensive.
If you go for a Type 4 style 2.0l you'll have to put an upright conversion kit on it to fit it in the back of the 71.
You can kiss about a grand goodbye for that alone &amp; rebuilding that sort of engine at the is going to be quite pricey....belive me, I know!
If you choose to keep a Type 1 style 1600 case &amp; bore &amp;/or stroke it then there are other probs.
For instance, if you like driving in the desert be ready to fit an external oil cooler because going larger than a 1641cc means machining the block &amp; that will begin to take the strength out of it &amp; shorten the engine life &amp; will also mean that the engine runs hotter.
The truth is, that for an everyday driver a 1600, while not being a speedy proposition, is a very reliable one.
I'm sure there are people who will tell you that they can build a 1776 or 1835 that will run cool &amp; have a long life &amp; they may be right but more power for a bus that age is often expensive.
Of course you can always go the route I intend to with my 67 Panel.........a after-market fuel injected 1640 with a low boost supercharger to give it extra torque.
It'll be a long lasting engine, much more fuel efficient &amp; reliable sources have told me the engine actually runs cooler with the supercharger although I'll be intercooling the s'charger.
Anyway, check out the prices for an upright converted 2.0l......it may be cheaper where you are but I bet it will still be expensive in comparison to other builds.

-A few years ago I replaced the fuel pump in my 71 Westy. Still had the original pump. I replaced it with a sealed Brazilian made pump. The original worth anything? Should I keep it? The rubber diaphram (if that's what it's called) is shot. Any rebuild kits for these?

-What's it cost to get trim parts re-chromed? Like a mirror? Is it cheaper to just buy new? That is, buy the quality parts, not the el-cheapo stuff. Made the mistake of buying a really cheap-made replacement mirror and antenna. The antenna shakes and vibrates every time I hit the slightest bump.

-I live in Southern California. What's a fair price to pay for a decent paint job? I don't mean anything fancy. Just the basic &quot;good job,&quot; if there is such a thing. My bus is nice but I never want to make it so nice that I'm afraid of a few small dings or scratches. Currently is has a very cheap paint job--at least 10 years old--over the original. Original owner had it done. There's some flaking and it's about time for new paint.

-I want to upgrade my engine. I have got about 26K miles on a rebuilt engine I had installed 10 years ago. Paid $6-700 (?) for it. Had all the bolt-ons. Everything standard. 1600 in a '71. Case number (U5071232) on the rebuilt engine says it was a Type III 7.7:1 compression? Has ran great. Only recently did it begin to leak more than a few drops (literally) of oil a week. Now it's up to a few drops a day. Really doesn't burn any oil either. Less than half a quart to drive cross country. No bad sounds. A real solid engine. And I have ran the heck out of it. Regularly up to nearly 4K rpms in 3rd gear to pull hills, trips through Death Valley in August. That sort of thing. No sloppy or deliberate abuse. Regular oil changes and valve adjustments/checks every 2K miles. Very rarely driven over 60 mph. Have only had to adjust a valve four times in ten years/30K miles. I have been real lucky. Anyway, the problem with the engine is it just isn't engine enough for the driving I like to do in the hills and mountains. I'd like to have at least 25 more power. What's the best route to take? I'm willing to spend some $. But I want to have a very reliable engine. Not something that I have to pamper. Bigger engine, better cam, dual carbs--what's the best...or a good way to go?

-Ready for a new trans to. After 31 years the original sometimes pops out of 4th gear and is kind of overly &quot;sensitive&quot; to poor shifting into 2nd. Have heard a lot about &quot;Freeway Flyers.&quot; Good in a bus? Most of my driving is for weekend trips, often to the hills and mountains. Recommendations?

Thanks in advance.
