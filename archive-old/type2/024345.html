&gt; Got a pretty big trouble with my 32-34 pdsit-3 solex's, i turn on my engine
&gt; and leave it spining round 10 minutes and it consumes 2 liters of gas!!!
&gt; ...

 I'm no carb expert, but with these symptoms I'd start by checking that the
chokes are operating.

 Did it used to run OK or has it &quot;always&quot; been like this?


Cheers,
