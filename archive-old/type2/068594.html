&gt;Subject:
&gt;How are flywheels measured (Was 'looking for 228mm flywheel')
&gt;
&gt;  The original message reminded me of this.  I see these measures ( 200mm,
&gt;  215mm, 228mm ) tossed around a lot, since I have easy access to a
&gt;  wrecking yard, where are these dimensions actually measured, bolt hole to
&gt;  bolt hole, clutch disc contact surface??
&gt;
&gt;  Does anyone also know the number of teeth on the flywheels, all VW
&gt;  flywheels. Type 1, type 4, porsche 914 etc.
&gt;
&gt;  Thanks,
&gt;  Jeff

  Haven't seen any replies on this so I will take the bait.

 I have looked at three flywheels, an early bug 7&quot; (180mm), a late
bug,8.25&quot;(210mm) and a '72 bus,8.46 (215mm).

 The only thing those numbers equate to is the clutch disc face.

 All three have approx. the same outside diameter of 10.7&quot; (270mm)

 Still that can't be the only difference, there is difference in 
starters on those bugs. Don't know about the buses.

 I look at the teeth but just by eye and they don't appear different
either. I didn't count or measure tho.

 In fact all my measurements were with a tape measure.

 Once again there is more dark than light.

 Any of you people got data?  I feel real inadequate!

 Can anyone define the diff. in the bug starters ?

 Are there diff. Bus starters?
