&gt; &gt; getting nothing from the coil, no spark at all.......
&gt;
&gt; Just to double check all bases, are you still getting 12v to the coil?

yup nice and hot

&gt; perhaps something upline went out. I really feel for you with this thing
&gt; as these sorts of things are a huge pita. Something will show it's head
&gt; though. perhaps you just need to cool off with a frothy beverage and
&gt; clear your head?

current state of bevereage is indication that all is not well

mumble mumble mumble...

thanks
