Subject: driving advice?

Guten Tag volks,

I hope that this post is not redundant as I have not checked archives 
for &quot;driving bus with failing fuel pump&quot;, though I did check fuel pump 
stuff... 'nuf said.

So my bus is a 1969 with stock 1600 and everything is the same except 
for a 009 distributor.  Was my daily driver from 1987 to 1997, then was 
having trouble with the idle (drives and dies) and was leaking from the 
small circular ?? (Yikes, I don't know what it is) near the base of the 
fuel pump. After being stored for 5 years  I just recently towed her 
from Texas to Boulder, CO and having checked the valves, plugs, points 
and other simple maintenance stuff, it still has the same leak (of 
course!).  She started right up this morning and I drove her about 10 
minutes, then to an appt, about 10 minutes, then on the way back home 
she died when I let off the gas.  Also, when I check the oil it smells a 
bit of gasoline.  OK I am getting to my point-- I don't have the tools 
and knowhow to change my fuel pump and have an appt. for tomorrow to 
take it to a repair shop (only guy I talked to that I trusted in a 40 
mile radius), which is about 40 miles from my home.  I was going to have 
my AAA tow it there, but now am wondering if I'm being a &quot;wus&quot; to tow 
her and should drive her instead?  Aside from the occasional dying, 
could this really foul something else up?  Thanks a bunch for any advice.
Best, Karen
