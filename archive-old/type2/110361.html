&lt;&lt; I can use any insight you may be willing to give. &gt;&gt;

Did you check your distributor's full range of centrifugal advance with a 
timing light up to 3500rpm and also verify that the vacuum advance is working?  
Did you verify a good spray pattern out of each injector&quot;

My bus had a vacuum leak between the throttle body and intake plenum and a 
leak between the intake runners and cylinderhead.  I suspect both were leaning 
out the mixture.

I personally wouldn't run straight 30 oil in the summer.  Here in the west, I 
see a lot of folks consistently running 20w50 because of the high daytime 
temperatures.

Check your thermostat and air control flaps for correct operation.  Make sure 
all tin is in place and that you have a good engine tin to body seal.  I also 
seal all my tin pieces together with a bead of high temp silicone &quot;caulk&quot;.

Make sure your battery trays on both sides are rust/hole free and that there 
is no rust/holes in the lower rear wheel wells; also check that you have a 
good seal on the engine compartment door.

You do not want to be sucking ANY hot air back through!
