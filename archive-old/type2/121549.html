Subject: RE: [T2] Subaru Van's

I've got 90% of a Corvair 2.7 liter 110 HP in my bus too. I'll tell you 
more about it when it's finished. Definitely doesn't sound like a VW... 
More like the VW's six cylinder cousin that starts with a &quot;P&quot;. Love those 
flat six sounds.

I'm lusting after the 3.1 liter Corvair conversion, That is a 2.7 L with 
94mm VW pistons and jugs grafted in. Fuel Injection too please...

I've seen pics of Steve's bus. NICE.

&gt;I've got a 2.7L flat six in my 69 bay. Its not a Subaru though. It's a
&gt;rebuilt 69 Corvair engine ( and matching tranny ). I wanted to keep my
&gt;bus aircooled. I can't say it sounds much like a VW anymore. The fweem
&gt;is gone. But on the other hand, gone is the stress about merging onto
&gt;highways.
