Hey all,

I'm trying to find a place, either online or a retail store, where I can
order fabric for a camper mattress and seat. I'm hoping to find an
alternative to the standard plaid coverings that most Westys have, but I'd
consider that if there are no other options around. Also, my bus has no
fabric covers and has been at the repair shop since I bought it and I
haven't had a chance to measure anything--does anyone know what size fabric
I need? It has the basic camper conversion with the rear seat that folds
down into a bed. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
