Subject: [T2] First time engine pull....


&gt; Well, I've bit the bullet and decided to take the 2.0 liter fuel injected
&gt; engine out of my air-cooled '80 Westy. [snip]. My question...
&gt; Do I need to remove the tin before pulling the engine (I believe I do) and
if
&gt; so, does anyone have any insight into how this is most easily done?

No, you don't need to remove the tin before dropping the engine.  Drop it as
one piece except for a few things (dip stick, AFM and air intake elbow) that
will give you clearance.

&gt; Also, I know I've read it before in this forum, but what is the best
&gt; way/product to use to degrease the engine and clean up all the parts I've
&gt; already taken off?

Elbow grease and your favorite degreaser are a good combination.  If you've
got a large garage sink you can wash many pieces of tin in hot water and
soap, though you'll be amazed how tenacious the dirt/oil combination can be,
especially in the corners.  I'm not a big fan of &quot;spray-on/hose-off&quot; stuff
since it tends to make a mess below the vehicle and ultimately ends up in
the groundwater/rivers/oceans.
