Subject: Re: [T2] In need of odometer gear...

[...]


&gt; Buenos noches all!  I'm looking for that little white gear that turns the
&gt; odometer shaft, which in turn, turns the miles. I've searched my local scrap
&gt; yards and come up empty handed.  I would be very grateful if anyone might
&gt; have a spare!?  Peace to all

It should be a 9 tooth gear.
Before VDO stopped making them available, they were black. The black ones seem
to last longer than the white ones.....
Good luck. Your best chance may be off another speedo. A later Vanagon will work
also.
