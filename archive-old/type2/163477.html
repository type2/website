Subject: Running for governor in a '78 bus

After learning that Phillip Morris NaPier the People's Hero drives a 
'78 bus, I just had to sub up and let everyone on the list know about 
it.

NaPier, who says his full legal name is Phillip Morris NaPier the 
People's Hero, is running for governor of Maine. Pictures of him and 
his bus can be found at:

I've been in Maine about six weeks now. It's colder than Southern 
California just about now.
