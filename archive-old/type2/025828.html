&gt; originally, i thought the horn was disconnected by the PO due to a
&gt; short...beeping all by itself, but since the wires are connected under the
&gt; bus now, i have no eye deer.
&gt; 
&gt; anyone run into this problem before?  the fuse is good, so i know i'm okay
&gt; there!  i don't know what to check next.

Before I start, any time a component or wire tests bad clean the terminals,
replace the push-ons for those terminals, and try it again. Many electrical
problems on old cars are caused by dirty or corroded connectors.

Do you have a battery charger, or some other source of 12v that isn't part
of the horn circuit? Put on your hearing protection and connect your source
of 12v to the terminals on the horn itself--positive wire on one prong,
negative on the other. If it doesn't beep when you do this, the horn itself
is bad. Replace if necessary, then...

Next, connect your voltmeter between the 12v wire and a ground. If you see
12v, the wire's good; if not, run a new wire. (Which one's the 12v wire? Try
them both; only one should have 12v on it. If they both do, that's another
problem.)

Next, hook the 12v wire to one prong on your working horn and hook the other
prong to a ground. Since we know you have 12v on the wire, it should beep.

Now hook the horn button (ground) wire back up (VW has a weird idea about
switching; most people would put the switch in the hot lead, but VW switches
the ground) and push the horn button. If it still doesn't work, go in the
cab and remove the horn button, then connect the horn button wire to a
ground. If the horn doesn't honk, the ground wire for it is bad; if it does,
the switch is.
