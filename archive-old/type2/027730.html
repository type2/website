Hi Volks,
   Someone started this thread by saying &quot;...I have been thinking about the 
functionality of the Westy icebox unit in the 68 to 73 campers. Please share 
you experiences and ideas for making it work...&quot;

   Well we still have the icebox in our 71 and are happy with the way it 
works.  Of course we also still have the wire basket and plastic tray in the 
icebox.  We fill plastic bags with ice cubes and that goes in the basket, 
the tray underneath the basket catches the drippings and sends them 
overboard through a drain tube.  We've found that the ice will last about 2 
days while keeping things cool.  Not cold mind you, but cool.  Enough to 
kept food from spoiling even if it isn't cold enough to chill your beer.
   My vote would be to leave the original unit installed.
