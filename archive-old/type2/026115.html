Subject: Best location for fire extinguisher?
Date: Mon, 22 Mar 1999 14:13:38 -0000
Return-Receipt-To: Dave Horrigan &lt;DaveH_at_apdcomms.co_dot_uk&gt;

Can anyone recommend a good place to mount a fire extinguisher?  I
bought a 1kg powder extinguisher a few months back and I can't decide on
the best place to put it.  It's just rolling around under the sink at
the moment.  It needs to be within easy reach of the drivers seat for
rapid deployment, but not somewhere I'm going to trip over it.  So far
I've thought of between the back of the seat and the bulkhead (a bit
tight) or between the seat and the door (would make it difficult to
slide the seat back and forth).
So, any better ideas out there?
