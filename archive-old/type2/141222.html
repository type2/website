Hy Greg.
I believe these bumpers are the same, but with black mate finish. At least 
here the bumper are the same. many people dont know but this model of bus 
(higher roof and biger side windows) only start being mande in Brazil from 
1997. Before that the model made here is the Bay front with the split body 
(15 windows an panel).

Happy new year.

 Hi Prappas,

 That thing looks great. I particularly like the early style bumpers.
 I would add those to my late-bay in a heartbeat. Are they for the
 special edition only, or can they be fit to any 73-later bus?

 Ron, are you listening???


From P r a p p a s:

 here are a few shots that i made last weekend. of a Silver Edition
 Bus and some information to.
