check your dwell mter... if its really old it may have to be hooked up to the 
motor a different way. vw's firing order is not what you might expect if you 
have only worked on American engines. you may be able to rent (for 
essentially free) at your local auto parts chain or big parts store another 
dwell meter, with its own set of instructions for various engines. eliminate 
the problem of the meter first, then go on to the engine.
