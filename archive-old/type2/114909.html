Subject: My Kid's New Bus part 2

You must be right near my relative in Brick Township.
I'm in California, so I have only a vague idea of things new jersey these days....

I've dealt with the shifter a lot in my 76 and it's great now.

In order of ease/least cost/things I did first to
difficult/expensive/done last.......

Verify and replace if necessary all the bushing in the shift linkage. For the first bushing, right underneath the shift rod, the bentley only shows the early version, which sticks inside the horizontal shift linkage, the later version having a bushing that the linkage passes thru.

the two(three?) bushings inside the rear linkage (find the coupling setscrew in the middle) seem to be poor quality repoductions that don't fit. skip em.

the Y-shaped, as you call it, cage as I call it, coupler should have significant positive effects. some people say the tranny must be moved to install, my mechanic has done it without.

Finally, what made my shifter feel like it was new off the floor, was to replace a bushing inside the nosecone of the tranny that the gear selector rides in.

P/N for this item has not yet been found, and it'll cost you 200-300 in labor at the shop, in my case well worth it.

that all,

Billy

We tried to adjust the shifter . . . no luck.  The y shaped coupler in the rear seams to be OK.  Anyway, the situation as it stands is the bus is stuck in either first or third and it seems like something in the linkage is stopping it from finding the other gears.  I am afraid it might be beyond us, however, my kid just got Bentley in the mail
