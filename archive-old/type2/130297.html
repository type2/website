Subject: Re: [T2] gas mileage

&gt;One of these days, I'd like to do a little experiment and drive 
&gt;55 instead of 65 on the freeway, to see if it increases my mileage 
&gt;significantly (I expect it probably would).  However, driving 55 
&gt;can be downright dangerous on freeways around here (even at 65, 
&gt;people are blowing by me if the traffic isn't jammed up), and 
&gt;you just might get a ticket for impeding traffic or creating a 
&gt;hazardous driving condition.

I keep telling myself that I should drive my 73 Westy 70-75MPH instead of
85-90.  I did this once a few years ago and kept it between 70 and 75 MPH
and got 19MPG.  Normally I get a whopping 15 MPG, but like I said, that's at
speeds that'll keep you running with the big SUV's out there.

As to impeding traffic?  My biggest kick is coming onto the freeway ramp
near my house at about 55 (due to the sharp curve just before) and watching
8 or 9 cars all move into the fast lane because they see an old VW bus
coming on in front of them.  But by then I'm shifting into 4th and pushing
it up past 80 MPH and then into 5th at 85.  Then I get to watch a few of the
cars stay in the left lane still expecting to go sailing by, but they never
get the chance as I crest 90 before backing off a little bit.  And no, this
isn't a daydream.  It's reality with a 5-speed tranny and a fuel injected
914 2.0 motor :)
