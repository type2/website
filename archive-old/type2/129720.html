Subject: stevo trips

working the backroads in my 75 bus. tour included passes thru susanville,
reno, cedar something utah and the canyonlands. side tripped to telluride
and around to durango. spent a morning in taos at the pueblo, blasted thru
oklahoma, and grabbed a hotel in fayetteville, ark.. spending a few days
now in little rock before proceeding onto tennessee and toward the outer
banks. no major problems, and the bus handled three passes of 10.6k feet
in the san juan mts - one of which was 11k. only thing was a hinge snapped
on the westy top, but a piece of wood i found in the kodachrome basin near
bryce is holding up.  looking forward to the gulf stream and cheese steaks
near philly.

five people in a bus, and only three stiches so far. not too bad. more
later from the big pit stop on south jersey beaches, where dear sweet mom
awaits us.

saw two acvw buses.. terrible average. handfull of vanagons, but jeez
where is everybody? gas is only 2 bucks in ok and ark...
