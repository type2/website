Subject: [T2] BN 4 GAS HEATER

Darren,

&quot;The question is - what would cause this reset button to trip and what do I
need to do to stop it from tripping? so it will stay on for longer than 2-3
minutes?&quot;

Check the glow plug.  If it is collecting a black sticky carbon, it will not
glow and thus trigger the automatic shut off on the heater.  Simply
remove the blade connector, pull the wire, ratchet it off, and clean off the
soot.

I have to clean mine 2-3 times a week.  I haven't figured out, or have
been too lazy, to pinpoint the cause of the buildup.
