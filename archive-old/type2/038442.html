Subject: Strippe CV Joint hex nut

Hello All,
Last night it came down to the last bolt on my inner cv joint to be broken, 
and the little bugger stripped right out.  It felt like it had already been 
in bad shape.  I was going to try filing a flat edge to grip on, any 
suggestions to a better way?
Thanks,

Eggz
