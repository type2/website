Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust manifold wrapping

&lt;&lt; What is that thing metal wrapping around the exhaust manifold for?

I don't have any on the drivers side, and the passengers side has it, but 
its almost completely rusted through.

Is it important?

I know VW wouldn't have wasted their money putting it on (if not required), 
or would they?


Should I replace it?

I ask because Id like to just cut the rest of it off unless I really need 
it. &gt;&gt;

Since it's just spring (thanks, e. e.), you probably won't need 'em till
the fall... ;-(
But seriously, I'd get hold of a manual for your bus. Sounds like you're
unfamiliar with the basic design (it's quite different from water-cooled
vehicles).
