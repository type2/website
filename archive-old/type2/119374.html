Subject: irt: Mysterious Vacuum Gauge Readings

Steve:
My carb stix (intended for motorcycles but are 'Da Bomb' for vw carb
synchronization) have little restrictors to dampen out the sudden
delta-vacuum found in a short intake tract.

I'm not a pancake engine guy, don't play one on T.V. and so can't
picture the carbs in question after a long workday without actually
seeing them up close.  

Tie in:
If your vacuum guage does not have the restrictors, every delta-vacuum
event will be reflected as fast as the guage can respond.  If you've
tied into a straight manifold vacuum port on the mystery carb with
undampened guage you'll probably get the jumpy readings described.  Or,
if something's not quite tight, an intermittent vacuum leak could be
there

Questions questions questions:
Are these 'known good' carbs?
I know you've checked this but I still have to ask - are there any
vacuum leaks upstream from the carbs to the intakes at the heads?
When you tied the 2 sides together did the frequency of the wild
oscillations double?  If so then you probably are reading undampened
vacuum.  If not there's a problem on only 1 side but you indicated the
same symptoms from both sides....

Dunno man, that's what comes to mind.  Find a biker with a set of carb
stix, ask nicely, and he may loan them to you for a bit.  Those of us
wih older BMW bikes tend to have such items rattling around.

Let us know what you find!
