Subject: Correct 15&quot; MB or Audi rims for acceptable offset

I have read ratwells comments and the type2 tire/rim info, but there are a large no. of rims listed for the Mercedes and Audi. Can anyone tell me which car rims from which EXACT year and  model they're using in order to run 15&quot; wheels on a bay? The tire selection is SO much better in 15&quot;.
Thanks,
Courtney
