Subject: New to list / help with windshield wipers

Hi-  
  I recently bought a 68 Westy.  This is my first bus, so I've been learning
a lot
by just lurking in the background and reading everything on the list.
Anyway,
my current problem is a lack of wiper arms for my bus.  I have the motor,
linkage, etc, but no arms.  I've looked around online and at a couple stores
and have been unable to find replacement arms.  I've been told they are
next to impossible to find.  Any suggestions out there?  Can I mount arms
from a different year bus (or any other car) to my wiper shafts?  Will I
need to 
convert the entire assembly to another model year?

Thanks for any help,
Brad Baker
