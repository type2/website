Subject: Re: [T2] sender units

From Kevin H. Roberts:
Hi guys.  I am still wondering about the sender unit
in the tank.  Or is it by the tank?  What's the
inherent problem with these?  It's obviously sending
something for it to read half-full.  But this is a
common problem.  One guy here said that he changed the
wire and it fixed it.  I'm just wondering what the
underlying problem is.  I may or may not change mine. 
Might wait until I have to have the engine dropped for
something else. But if the price is right I'll go
ahead and buy one of those in advance.  I wonder if I
really need one.  Thanks...KR

1) it goes in to the top of the tank.
2) the problem is friction constantly rubbing across the resistance wire.
3) if you have a mid 73 to 79 bus, you NEED one.
