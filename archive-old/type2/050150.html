Subject: [T2] Heat Exchanger

Where are you located?  I have both heat exchangers/manifolds from the
original engine for my '75.  Not sure what kind of shape they're in, 'cause
I put a '73 engine in.  I also have a couple of the bits of tin for that
year.  I'm in Olympia.

Also - I know of two VW-only wrecking yards in the state.  One is Carter &amp;
Son VW, in Chehalis (www.localacces_dot_com/vw) (360) 748-3008.  They're only
open M-F 8-5, but I've dealt with them a number of times in the last 15
years and have had no negative experiences.  The other is Averre's (I think
they have a web site at www.averres_dot_com) down in the Longview/Kelso area.  I
don't have their number.
