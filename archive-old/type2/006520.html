	You may have bought the wrong vehicle? 
	 First don't expect to get much better than 
	20-25 USmiles per USgallon of gas out of a bus at normal 
	highway speeds. AT 90MPH, I don't think any body has
	any numbers on this - see next point
	Second don't expect to cruise at 80-90 in a bus because this
	will take fairly hopped up, expensive, low reliability engine, and
	also the bus isn't made to go 90MPH. It doesn't have the handling,
	brakes, center of gravity, or aerodynamics to go that fast. In fact
	I think most bus drivers would agree 90MPH in a bus is scary, if not

	crazy.
	I sometimes drive my bus at 70-75 Canandianmiles/ Canadianhour
	but this is scarier than driving a more conventional car on three
wheels is.
	I suggest you look into the other vehicle Mr. Porsche designed,
which is a 
	6 cylinder air cooled rear engine unit.

&gt; 
&gt; Hey there people.  I am just buying my first bus and my first air cooled
&gt; VW. 
&gt;   I own VW jetta currently.  This bus I am buying has no engine in it so I
&gt; 
&gt; am looking for another engine to put in it.  It has the mounting brackets 
&gt; for a bug engine but I don't know what engine to get.  I don't want to get
&gt; 
&gt; the stock engine power and I don't want the most powerful engine in the 
&gt; world.  Something that will get me going pretty good, doesn't hog gas,
&gt; will 
&gt; do good on the interstate so I can go atleast 80-90 Mphs without pushing
&gt; it, 
&gt; and something not to costly.  Does anybody know were I can get a engine
&gt; that 
&gt; fits that description.  Some were online, in a magazine, or at a local 
&gt; store??  Thanx peeps.  See ya.
