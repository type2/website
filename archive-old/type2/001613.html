I drove my bus all day with the Gene Berg temp sensor out, and felt much
better. I really don't think I'm getting all that hot, since the light would
go out when driving below 45 mph. I had to do something though to feel good
about my bus, so I replaced the upper cot that I had recently recieved from
Bus Depot. It's white and not tan like the original, so it will show stains
easily, but my 8 year old boy is so excited about camping and sleeping up
there. The replacement went without a hitch, and looks great. Funny how
changing something little about your bus makes you feel good about your bus
again.
