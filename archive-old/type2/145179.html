Anything can be done with sufficient money.  You may not get the nice
stamped sheet metal shape, but if you make a set of boxes out of 16ga
material you won't have to worry about them for a good long time!  Might
be worth a few hundred dollars of fabricator's time!

There's a business opportunity for someone!
