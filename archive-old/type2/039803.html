Subject: Looking for Cooling Tin
Content-Disposition: inline

Greetings,

I am missing the two pieces of cooling tin that are suppose to go under the cylinders/pushrod tubes.  I still have the little pieces that insert between the cylinders.  This is for a '79 non CA, 2.0 liter, FI stock engine.  I don't know if these pieces are the same on other years.  Somebody must have some laying around.  I've looked in some of the junk yards around here, but I only found 2 busses and their tin was already taken.

TIA
