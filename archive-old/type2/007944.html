Subject: stripped fan bolts
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com



big problem-
i have a 1700 pancake that i am rebuilding. i am in the process of
dismantling, and the heads on the three recessed allen head bolts with
rounded heads (no way to get a grip on them with vice grips, dammit!)
that hold my fan on are stripped all to hell. allen wrench just spins
and spins.(my fault!) i can't get to the bolts that hold the rear fan
housing in place without pulling the fan (as far as i know) and was
wondering... can i just drill the heads off of the three bolts holding
the fan on since i'm probably getting a new one or am i not seeing
something?  will i be able to get the fan pulled off by drilling these
bolts out?
