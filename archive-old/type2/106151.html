Subject: Re: [T2] Fuse Question...and more electrical problems

Fuses blow when that circuit starts pulling more amps than it should.
With a signal light circuit, that's usually because of a short to chassis
ground.
Of course, the entire chassis is a ground.
These shorts are usually intermittant and can be maddening to find.
One good way to tell if you have a chassis short to ground on a circuit is
to remove the lamp or load at the end of the circuit, so that you now have
an open circuit, and then to remove the fuse and put a volt-ohmmeter across
the load side of the fuse (opposite the hot side) and the somewhere on the
chassis where you can get a good bite. With the fuse and the lamp or load
removed, the meter should read open or infinity. So far, so good. Now, have
a friend rock the car back and forth, to and fro. A lot of times, you will
get to see the needle swing to the right, indicating a chassis ground...
somewhere where the wire has rubbed. It might be a worn grommet going
through an opening in the chassis, or some other element that is loose and
rubbing. You still have to find the location of the chafing, so you've still
got a job on your hands, but it can confirm a problem that is intermittent
and brought on by movement.

The other problem could be a headlight relay or switch. I would also
recommend locating and cleaning contacts before replacing anything. They can
get dirty and malfunction. Good cleaning tools are q-tips with alcohol, an
ordinary strip of paper, a strip of fine emery cloth.
