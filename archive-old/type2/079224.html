Subject: RE: [T2] generator light....

Darrel,
	I find that the armature sometimes wears in a sawtooth pattern, this is
very quick to demolish a new set of brushes. Get it out and lathe it if you
can, (this is best)or sand it if you are short of lathe or bux.

&gt; &gt; I have put new generator brushes in the top part of my generator about 2
&gt; &gt; weeks ago.  That stopped the generator light from going on.
&gt; Then it started
&gt; &gt; to come back on three days ago.SNIP
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I checked the brushes and they are almost warn down already.
