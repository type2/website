Subject: Re: [T2] resistance specs/temp 2 sender

&gt;The wire that should connect to the head temp sensor
&gt;on the 1979 engine in my 75 bus is grounded to the
&gt;engine tin.  I bought a new sensor and then discovered
&gt;that there is no place in the tin for it to go.  

I know it's a real bandaid, temporary work-around, but if you have a ohm meter 
and about 15 feet of 16 gauge wire you can buy a potentiometer with a suitable 
range (like 0-2500 ohms) and manually control your ECU during warmup. (You can 
find these at Radio Shack or any electronics supply store for 1-2 dollars).  

You'd want to use the ohm meter to get an idea where 2200 ohms, 1500 ohms, 1000 
ohms, 500 ohms, and 150 ohms was on the potentiometer.  Then run a wire from 
the FI wiring harness up through your inside engine hatch to the front of your 
bus.  Attach the wire to the potentiometer and ground the other input.  When 
cold, turn the pot to wherever 2200 is and over the next few minutes, turn the 
pot down lower and lower.

Pain in the butt to do something manually that should be automatic, but it sure 
beats hell out of over-working your starter and the embarrasment that goes 
along with re-starting your bus for 5 minutes!
