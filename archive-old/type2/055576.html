Subject: Thanks Ted, Thanks Karl, Thanks All!

Well I just want to thank Ted Bear, and Karl von Salzen. 
I posted asking where I could get an Air Flow Meter cover as mine was burned
in 'the fire'. 
Well both Ted, and Karl just mailed me the part.
This is yet an other example of where people in this group have sent me
parts that I've been having trouble finding up here. This sense of
'community' is getting fairly uncommon in this world and is one of the
things that makes this group special. 
Without the help I've got from this group , I probably would not have ever
got my van back on the road after the engine fire.
I would probably have sold it to someone as it was after the fire, and there
is no gaurantee it would have ever been on the road again.

Thanks Volks!
