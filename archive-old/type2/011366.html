Found a ahhh... &quot;interesting&quot; bus pic on the web.  If you're a resto-freak with 
a weak stomach you might not want to look at this one.

Go to:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/demonspawn914/autogallery/
and click on &quot;BUGS&quot; then click on &quot;1998&quot; - it's the left-most pic on the second 
row.  Be sure to note, among other things, the roof.

Anybody planning on being at the RMMW show (Woodland Park, CO), the Colorado VW 
Bus Club campout (Rainbow Falls Campgrounds near Woodland Park, CO), or the 
Bandimere Show (Denver, CO) this weekend???  I'm planning on all 3 so if you're 
gonna be here let me know - maybe we can meet.
