Hi all,
I am just catching up on the digests so this is prob all dead and buried, but 
anyway...

Last time I locked my keys in the car i was quite disturbed how easy it was to 
get in. On the top of my poptop there is a small hatch. I found a long stick, 
then jumped up on the roof (got quite a few looks at this stage), then opened 
the hatch, pulled the flyscreen out underneath it then manouevered the stick 
onto the sliding door lock. All in all this was about a ten minute operation. 
Kind of made me think twice about all the junk i keep in there.......
