A local shop wanted a couple of hours labor just to insert the glass and
re-install the latch bases in the wingvents of the bus that is getting
reassembled. I figured that I could use the $118.00 plus parts and tax
better than they could... Sometimes prior experience is priceless. Read on...

I spent all day and night Saturday monkee wrestling the wing vent glass and
frame assemblies together for the newly repainted &quot;Rat&quot; '63 EZ camper. 
Most of the affair was as enjoyable as fine public dining with a feverish
two year old or wisdom teeth extraction with out pain killers. Come Sunday
morning I am pissed off at myself and having to redo the whole affair
because of a few simple mistakes. Other than that it was a great opportunity
to listen to my neighbor's incessantly blaring Ranchero music.

My take on things is that the wise old guru guy sitting up in the mountains
has made every mistake possible *or watched someone else's mistakes and
avoided them.* The guru is percieved as wise only because he never admited
to making mistakes. As a former teacher I prefer to spread the wisdom and
help you avoid future frustrations. Here you go...

Guru tip &lt;mistake&gt; #1million:
Always take time to physically or mentally dry fit parts together. Double
check what you are doing! Make sure that you know how the whole assy will
work when together.
My failure to do this is costing me more of my time...&lt;frustration&gt;

Guru tip &lt;mistake&gt; #1million and 1:
Make sure that the base for the wing latch is on the correct side. Prior to
inserting the glass etc. You might have to replace the latch pivot base.
The base sits in the U shaped channel. A cylindrical portion of the latch
base,of course, is placed so that it is on the opposite side of the upper
rivet/pivot. The latch base on each side gets two rivets.

Point&gt;&gt; The tall side on the base's cylinder should be closest to the rear
of the bus.

I spent over an hour Saturday night trying to assemble one of the latches
and quit in frustration. I had previously accomplished this feat in less
than a few minutes on other trys. It wasn't until Sunday morning in fresh
light and strong coffee that I was slapped in the face with my error. It
could have been easily avoided by dry fitting the latches prior to setting
the rivets

Guru tip &lt;mistake&gt; #1million and 2:
The vent wing frame has a threaded shaft.
There is a small caged area just below the pivot hole on the main upper
window assembly.

Remember to insert a flat washer onto the main threaded pivot shaft as you
shove that shaft through the smallish caged area.

That washer assists in the vent window tension adjustment.

------------------------------

I will be tearing down the wing vent assys and redoing them to the incorrect
positioning of the latch bases and the washer omission. I hope that I have
saved you some frustration!
