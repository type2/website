&quot;Tim Hayes&quot; wonders??
  Did all of the bay
&gt; window buses have sliding doors?  Or could you get
&gt; cargo doors?  I like the cargo doors, but it should
&gt; not be that big of a deal.  Thanks for the help in
&gt; advance.
Tim:
68-79 Bus = one slider on the side, left or right depending on approprate
side of road driving conventions in your home country.
