&gt; hello Bob  glad you got your compression problem fixed,  What did  you end up
&gt; doing??

they were fly cut too deep, slid them just far enough off to inspect and
put in the old style alum gasket. pushed em back and torqued em down to
spec

&gt;   Check your wires and plugs first.

did that

&gt; then check for  vacuum leaks.

my suspicion but can't find anything

&gt; make sure air flow meter is pluged in also injectors are pluged  in  later  mark d

yup all tight.


thanks
Bob
