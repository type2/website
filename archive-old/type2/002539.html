&gt;&gt; That question about the homemade air cleaner reminded me of a project on
my
&gt;&gt; backburner:  I'd like to convert the oil bath air cleaner on my 71 Westy
to
&gt;&gt; use a paper filter.  I figure I can find a cylinder filter that I can fit
&gt;&gt; inside the can, with no outside changes.  I'd like to keep the outside of
&gt;&gt; the filter assembly stock, but never have to mess with the oil again.
Does
&gt;&gt; anyone know of an off the shelf filter that will work?  Or any reason why
I


Well off hand I'd venture a vanagon style cannister filter or for that
matter an 80's vintage Dodge Caravan filter would fit the case, you could
remove the filter media and rig a spacer to seal the filter perhaps?  But
I'll mention this.  I read an SAE report a few years ago comparing oil bath
wicking filters to some popular pleated paper and oiled gauze element
filters and the bath was superior on all counts.  VW knew what they were
doing, it lasts forever and maintainence isn't really all that involved.
  This said I'm throwing out a possible idea for everyone though,  for other
reasons I had to wash the filter element on the '70.  Sat the top part with
the horsehair in a 5 gallon bucket of kerosene for an hour, then as it
became evident I'd go through kerosene forever went to TSP and hot hot
water, and did about 3 water changes then finished back in the kerosene.  It
was AMAZING what came off that stuff, and scary.  But when I was finished
the hair appeared brand new and clean as a whistle.  It is a thought to
anyone, has your filter had regular maintainence it's entire life, and just
what did VW figure its life was?  I'm quite happy with the result and feel
much better about what the truck now sucks its air though.  Oh after the
last water wash I hooked a compact hair drier into the outlet with duct tape
and let it blow dry for a good half hour, whole thing was toasty warm with
no moisture left, then once into the kerosene dried then reassembly with a
cleaned bottom half and new oil.
