This month's VW Trends had an interesting, although limited, article on 
early delivery VWs (bus &amp; PU). Of interest to me was the 50s model van, 
painted red/orange, w/ the VW emblem replaced by the CocaCola &quot;cap&quot; 
(round sign, says Drink CocoCola)... used in England to deliver product.

Another interesting accessory for early single cabs was the delivery 
cap. From the rear, it looked like a windowless van (the rear panel 
was removed, and sometimes the side panels, making the PU into a 
flatbed, w/ this unit bolted to the top). On the sides, a canvas cover, 
perhaps w/ wooden stiffeners, could be lowered to cover the produce. To 
tie the rear panel to the front, a &quot;banner board&quot; is attached, which 
usually carried the name of a softdrink company, or such.

The vans/PUs were delivered in white primer.

They also showed one of the VW van ads, which ran frequently in the late 
60s. VW had a terrific ad campaign going back then... nothing like the 
Farfromthinkin ads of the later campaigns. This particular ad showed a 
65 or 66 Deluxe, w/ a bunch of nuns climbing onboard. The banner read 
&quot;Mass Transportation&quot;.

The marketing people of VW were very savvy to the needs of Europeans, 
but I don't think they ever penetrated the US market properly. With few 
exceptions (such as the recently posted ambulance) the US did not see 
the commercial value of VWs. I suppose this is partially due to the 
reliability of US manufactured PUs, but perhaps more because of the 
mindset against VWs in general.
