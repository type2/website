&gt;Hmmm....I replaced the fuel pump on my '69 &lt;before&gt;
&gt;converting to an alternator. It looked pretty much the
&gt;same as the one I pulled off, but I wasn't really
&gt;comparing
What I understand is that the later mechanical fuel pump has a shorter push
rod and a lower profile so as to clear the alternator.  Perhaps you have the
short push rod version, it works fine with generator.  On my 1600DP,
originally from a 1974 Type 1, but with generator and early stand, I tried
to replace the fuel pump with the generator type but it still had the short
push rod from it's Type 1 days, didn't work. Is that clear as mud?
