&gt; &gt;Isn't the &quot;wider body&quot; that shows up in the specs just 
the wider flares on
&gt; &gt;the wheel-wells in 1979?
&gt; 
&gt; Dunno. I thought this was settled, but it appears it 
ain't. It would argue
&gt; that the 70 has a wider body than the 69 if this is true, 
because the 70
&gt; has more flair in the rear wheel wells, but I don't think 
anybody claims
&gt; that...
