Subject: Re: [T2] Re: overheating

&gt; I should have mentioned that my front tires are 70 series (purchased before I knew any
&gt; better) so that wasn't my real speed.  From surrounding traffic and engine speed I would
&gt; guess I was probably going about 10 mph less than indicated.

Ive usually seen bus speedos off even with the right tires.
Mine is ~10mph with 185R14s. Get someone to time you.
