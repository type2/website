I am rebuilding a 2.0L 79' FI from my '79 nine passenger.  I am having
difficulty removing the fan and the fan shroud.  My manual (which covers
1972-1979 Type-2) says to &quot;remove three bolts in center of fan and work
the fan off the engine...&quot;

It is not that easy... It seems that there is something else to this...

Anybody have more specific instructions...?
