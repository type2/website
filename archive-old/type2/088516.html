Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone know any further info about these campers?

Hi Ken,

I knew there was a aircooled company in the USA driving an original
Kemperink.
One of few Kemperink's that were not camperized and still in use as delivery
van.

You are right when you say Bestelwagen. They were sold as &quot;Bestelwagen
Speciaal&quot; what translates to Delivery Van Special.

Greetings,

&gt; &gt; What do you call it and what does the interior look like?
&gt;
&gt; I have TWO Kemperinks out here in Seattle, We call them &quot;Bestelwagens&quot;
&gt; I only know of one other in captivity in the western US or even all
&gt; forty eight states? My opening page of my website (www.thebusco_dot_com)
&gt; shows the '69 I use as a parts hauler for my used parts business.
&gt; I also have a Subaru powered '67,
