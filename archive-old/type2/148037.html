Subject: Re: [T2] Westy tent?

That's something we are torn over. One of the attractions of bus
camping is being able to be self-contained and not have to mess with
traditional camping with the tents and all. But we find ourselves
frustrated by all the stuff spread out in the bus that we have to
climb over to get around inside. So tent and trailer are two
alternatives we are considering. We have not yet been able to camp in
a proper camper with cabinents, so we want to try that too to see if
it really gets things out of the way.

&gt; Ya know, I was all excited when I got my Westy tent. But it wasn't
 until last night when I sat down and contemplated building it. And
 then I actually set it up today.

&gt; What a pain!

&gt; So I'm selling it.

&gt; Does anybody here really like their tents? Responses on The Samba
 appear to be about 50/50.
