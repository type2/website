I have driven in snow ranging from 1&quot; to 12&quot; with Yok Y356D and had 
no noticeable problems.  Although they are not M+S rated and do not 
shed snow very well, using the right driving techniques they seem 
usable in locales that receive moderate but infrequent snowfall. I 
would not recommend them for winters in a heavy snow prone zone.
