Subject: Orientation of bolt-on gear on camshaft.


Dear Type 2 Folks:

I lost the documentation on my new camshaft and bolt-on gear.

Can anyone offer guidance on how to orient the bolt-on gear (threee-holes) 
onto the camshaft?

I think it should be the timing dot (on one of the teeth of the gear) 
aligned with the slot on the end of the camshaft where the gear connects?

It is a new camshaft for a 1970 1600 bus.

Many thanks.

Bill Spencer
