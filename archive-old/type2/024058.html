&gt; I don't doubt that they (VDO) are inaccurate - you're the second person to 
&gt;  tell me that - but --- can you pry a cover off and adjust anything?

If the gauge is reading too high you can get it to read lower by adding the 
appropriate resistance in the circuit.  This will work on all the oil/water 
gauges with thermister (resistance varies as a function of temp) type sender. 
And will work on the CHT gauge which has a thermocouple sender (output 
voltage varies as a function of temp).


&gt;  On a side note the VDO tach I just bought has a calibration screw on the 
&gt;  back. I think I'll leave it alone... &lt;grin&gt;

Good thinking :-)
