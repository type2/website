Brett,

Thanks for the data point.  17 in. is within the range of other points I
have received do far. (Keep those cards and letters coming...) The drop on
accelaration is normal. Back in the good ol' days some cars came with a
vacuum guage on the dash labelled &quot;good gas milage, bad gas mileage,
passing, service engine&quot;  :-) 

The lower your vacuum the more gas you are using.  When you floor it under
load, the vac will drop immensely, and when you lift your foot off the gas
going down hill, it rises accordingly.  A permanent vac guage can be a
real driving habit improver.
