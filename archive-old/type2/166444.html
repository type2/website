Subject: Re: [T2] Suspension upgrades

Hi Sid,

Go with the biggest swaybay you can lay hands on. I upgraded the sway  
bar on my 1972 westy when I put a 914 engine in it back in 1986, and  
the combination was excellent.

If you like the twisties, then the swaybar and shock upgrade is  
highly recommended. Also make sure not to scrimp on tires or brakes!

&gt; Grupp!  I am currently bringing back to &quot;road&quot;, my '74 Westy, and  
&gt; perhaps have
&gt; put a little more &quot;oomph&quot;, in it, but,  I currently have some  
&gt; &quot;wide&quot; audi
wheels and requisite tires, but, should I install the EMPI front and  
rear sway
bar kit and renew my KYBs front and rear, or should I &quot;back out&quot;, and  
leave
the &quot;westy&quot; as is....factory suspension, etc.?  I love to go through the
&quot;twistys&quot; in the mountains here, and built the motor up enough to do  
it, now I
have to make the suspension adapt.  Any sugestions are muchly  
appreciated!
Sid
