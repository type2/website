Subject: LPG in VWs

Folks,

Reading Hanno's post about LPG is very interesting. 

LPG is readily available here in Australia. Most taxis run on LPG, even 
in country towns. It is generally available as a factory option on 
vehicles which may have a commercial life.

I'm sure a tank could be accommodated in something the size of a bus.

A lot of vehicles get converted because, as in Holland, LPG is 
substantially cheaper. The main thing that has prevented me from giving 
it serious consideration, is the cost of conversion. I'm not sure what it 
is, but it's fairly expensive and the savings in fuel would take a while 
to recover for non-commercial users. 

I suppose I have to admit that I don't have Hanno's committment to the 
environment yet, so the dollars have a higher priority (just don't tell my 
kids).
