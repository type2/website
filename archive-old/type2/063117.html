Here we go:

yes it's another starter question. We're talking about a 1965 bus with a 1967
engine in it. Don't ask me why, I just got her and I'm the second owner. She
starts sometimes, sometimes not. Here's the symptoms:
    I can start her by jumping across the solenoid with a large screwdriver. 
    I can also compression start it, and it starts using jumper cables. 
    The starter is new, the solenoid is new, the battery is new, the spark plugs
are new, the points, rotor, cap, condenser, and distributor are all new. 
    The coil is old and the ignition switch is old. 
    When I turn the key it goes &quot;click&quot; and then nothing. 
    There is a flat spot in the ignition switch (if it feels like starting, you
can turn the key too far and it won't.) 
    I think the coil is maybe 6 years old, 3 of which were spent while the bus
sat under a tree, not moving the whole time.
    
Any help, suggestions, tips, tricks, new questions, anything, are all EXTREMELY
helpful and appreciated. I'm trying to restore this beauty so if anyone knows
something I can do with out drilling, cutting or jerry-rigging her, and it
works, I'd name my first child after you.

Thanks from the bottom of my heart,

scott
