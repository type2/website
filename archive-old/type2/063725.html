I have a tendency  to take every tool I own.  Usually I don't need any of them.
On a recent trip I was in my '69 and a friend in his '79.  We were barely out of
town when the electrics died from a melted down ignition switch.
He pulled out a complete electrical kit, including test equipment, wire and
crimp on fittings.  Half an hour later we were moving on down the road.  Just
another story  VW vans on the highway.
