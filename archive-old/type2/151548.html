Subject: Gear box

Hi all,

Well, finally I can tell you that our 69 bay-window, after doing a lot of
restoration after-hours, is ready for the big trip to Turkey.

One last question for now: the gearbox seams to make some wah-wah-wah noise.
It's been there for a long time but since we'll be driving some 10.000 kms I
wonder what symptoms there would be when it finally gives up? Do you think
we will have to change it while on the road? Any tips for extending it's
life?  I did change it's oil and yes, CV-joints and wheal bearings are brand
new.

So maiby we'll have to look for a Turkish gearbox... I don't mind, it's part
of the adventure.

Still eight working days to go, ready to leave on 1st august. You will hear
from me and I will need your help once far from home!

You know, you all helped a lot making this trip possible!

Bart
