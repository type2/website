Subject: Re: [T2] heating a bus

FIX THAT GAS HEATER!!  A gas heater is the BEST way to heat a bus, but  you
need to rebuild your heater, change the fuel lines and put a new exhaust on
it.  If you need rebuild parts, go to:

For those of you at the RMMW show this past summer, maybe you heard the
quiet &quot;roar&quot; of the gas heaters coming on and off in the Colorado busses
all night.  Those people who camp in the cold have figured out a good
working gas heater is a VERY nice addition on those cold nights.


&gt;i have a 71 non pop top camper that i need to heat... i can not use stock
&gt;heat exchanges due to a cheezy aftermarket header(soon to be replace)
&gt;i have an old stewart warner gas heater already mounted int the bus but it
&gt;smokes, i don't trust it while driving with my two children breathing in the
&gt;back... is it worth working on the gas heater.. it seems to pump out the
&gt;BTUs and heats the bus wonderfully but it also turns the bus into a gas
&gt;chamber.. would i be better off going with propane?
&gt;you can email me rather than clog the list if you prefer
