RD Robertson sed:

&gt;
&gt;While replacing one of the large heater air hoses underneath my
&gt;'79 bus, a key with a metal tag attached to it dropped onto the
&gt;driveway.
&gt;
&gt;I suppose that the dealer, or more likely, the factory, hid this
&gt;key and metal tag there.
&gt;
I hope all the folks going on key hunts under their cars will tell us what
they find. IMHO, however, I think the key was more likely hidden there by a
PO in case of losing/locking keys in car.

My SA 2c.
