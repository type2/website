Subject: im still alive!!!

hey all,

just wanted to email and let everyone know that i am
alright and still a part of this list. its just hard
to keep up ona couta im homeless. its ok though, not
really that bad. i move into my new house in 9 days!!!
at which point i will be more involved in the list.
just wanted to let everyone know, on the off chance
that anyone cared:-)


BTW- can anyone throw some possible causes of low
compression at me. besides the obvious ones like bad
rings. could mal adjusted valves cause low
compression?

thanks all,

Matty
