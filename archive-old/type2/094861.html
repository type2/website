Subject: Re: [T2] Installing cruise on 81 air-cooled Vanagon

Van Man

I installed a cruise control in my 77 (manual) bus following Donald Gibbons 
cruise control article in the Type 2 library.

This involved the installation of a Audiovox, CCS-100 (from Pepboys). I got 
the courage to do the job from Donald Gibbons great T2 library  article.

I used the same loop constants as in the article :
Settings. PPM - 5000
Speed signal - Tach only
Sensitivity - High (low power/heavy vehicles)
Control Sw - Norm open
Tach source select - coil

I did back off on the throttle lever arm attachment point from hole 2 to 
hole 3. The lowers the loop gain a little but on a brief test drive the loop 
seemed tight enough. The loop is too tight to control the engine RPM with 
the bus out of gear. (It pops right out as soon as I try to engage it.) But 
it operated smoothly at 55 and 65 MPH (in 4th).

I installed the servo unit inside the engine compartment with out trimming 
any of the wires (just coiled them up). So much for noisy engine compartment 
fears.

I also welded the weird washer to the lever arm to reduce slop.


My hat is off to Donald Gibbons.
