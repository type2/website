Subject: installing '69 master cylinder

To all:
RE: 1969 brake master cylinder (probably similar enough to '68 and '70)

When installing the twin-chamber brake fluid reservoir on top of 
the master cylinder, do I first install the rubber seals on the 
reservoir or in the master cylinder?

Please respond personally, as I am on digest mode.

Thanks!
