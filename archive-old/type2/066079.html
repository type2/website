&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure if I posted this or not, as I got no replies, so sorry if I am
&gt; boiling
&gt; my cabbage twice.
&gt; 
&gt; I need to urgently replace the fuel pump in my 2litre typeIV carb engine:-
&gt; 
&gt; Should I put a fuel filter inbetween the tank and pump?
&gt;     Yes otherwise between the pump and the carb,if the filter or it's couplings let go,gas will be pumped onto the engine for a likly fire!   
                     Peace phil
&gt; Do I need an M7 or M8 spline tool to remove the bolts holding the pump to
&gt; the crankcase?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible to do the job without dropping the engine? Ther is an
&gt; offensive piece of tinware
&gt; obscuring the top bolt.  The tinware is a small verticle piece, three of the
&gt; four screws holding
&gt; it in place are easy to remove the fourth is behind the starter and looks
&gt; impossible.
&gt; Do I have to remove the starter?
