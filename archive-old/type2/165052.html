Subject: Re: [T2] GPS again. :-)

If you don't care about a USB hookup you can buy the old Magellan Meridian Color for around $200.00, it was almost $700 when I bought mine new.

Get it in the package deal with all of the accessories and you will have roads, driving directions, car mount with power cord, computer cord.

The software is $100.00 outside of the package.

The driving directions are wrong quite often so it will give you the adventure you crave, sometimes it will have correct logging roads and incorrect paved roads, but it will usually get you where you need to go.

&gt; There are some ex $600 ones out there right now for $150. look online.
