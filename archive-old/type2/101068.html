Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield trouble

Richard,

IF...wups, no... *when* you get ready to replace the seal, you can
work the rust over pretty good and still put a new seal back in.

I did this on my bus last year before deciding to paint it.  If you have a 
non chrome window rubber, you are talking cheap.  I took mine out to asses 
the damage and then very carefully sanded the rust out.  I then painted
the rusty area with por-15 and put the window(and new rubber) back in.

If you are going to try this, then mark the current edge of the rubber to 
paint area and stay behind it when you sand and paint!  Go slow!

If you need to paint more, then consider just adding a line of black paint
below the window rubber...I don't think anyone ver noticed that mine
wasn't stock paint except another bay owner....cheap rust insurance before 
a major paint job.

If you get someone else to change out the rubber, then pay the price that 
the installer wants...they think their rubbers are better and would 
probably warrant them against leaking that way.

Cheers, dave

&gt;  I've got a windshield with rust under it that I hope to have properly repaired soon.  In the meatime I've sealed it up a little where it was leaking when it rained.
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday it rained like you wouldn't believe and water started to come in through the seal in a couple of places: the water hit the window, went down the inside of the seal, under the glass, and came up between the glass and seal on the inside.
&gt; 
&gt; I had this windshield replaced in 1997 just before I made the trek to Austin but I'm not sure if they put on a new seal.  I would guess not by the state of the seal now (dry and a little cracked in the corners).
&gt; 
&gt; I have to go on a trip and it's likely that it will rain on me while I'm on the road.  What can I do to seal the glass to the seal as a temp. fix up?
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to replace the seal now but I don't want to disturb the rust underneath until I can have the bodywork done to repair the damage.
