Subject: New Carb woes !!
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline

I have a 1973 bus with a 1700cc engine single carb, and I have had carb
problems for a while.  I rebuilt the carb last year and removed the choke
(electric) and it ran pretty good up until the last couple of months, now I
have been having to prime the carb to start it.  I bought a new Weber 32/36
carb and installed it on Friday and it starts really good. BUT now it
hesitates when I accelerate (like some of the past threads i've seen
recently). Another problem is that the linkage connection is not the same
as the old one and the accelerator peddle is very hard to depress. I
probably need to give my bus a real good tune up and try to set up the
linkage were there is not as much resistance. Anyone have any suggestions?

TIA
