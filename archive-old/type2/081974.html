Depends.  Could be the box.  Could be ohter suspension components.  Get out
the Bentley and check things out.  I wouldn't drive it like that.  Sounds
like something important could be very worn.

Subject: [T2] steering question


&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt; My '71 has very loose steering.  I have about 45 degrees of free play.
&gt;
&gt; Will adjusting the steering box fix this or is this a sign that more
serious
&gt; work on the steering box is needed?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Brian
