Thanks to all the helpful suggestions of the list members.  I have pulled the 
engine and everything looks intact.  The pilot bearing has grease and nothing 
is out of place. The pilot shaft is smooth and not scored. The new clutch 
disk, pressure plate and throw-out bearing still look new.  Is there anything 
I should measure? The relative of a  friend is coming by tomorrow to look at 
it, he has worked on quite a few VWs. This one is my first. Given the vehicle 
is 30 years old( OK 29!) I wonder what kind of mismatches have been installed 
over the years. I replaced the old clutch cable because it had been 
&quot;repaired&quot; by looping it back on itself with cable clamps to hold an eyebolt 
to attach on the yoke arm.  TIA for any ideas or information.
