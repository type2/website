Subject: '79 A/C Fan Belt Size

Group,

 

I've got a '79 Westy with dealer installed A/C and I am in need of a fan
belt for it. someone had suggested an 1180mm belt would work - well I tried
that yesterday and it is too short.  I did a search through the archives and
could not find a reference to belt size.  I will agree with many of the
posters that the process to put this belt on is a PIA.  I found a number of
folks in the archives that seem to have '79s with A/C and I hope you don't
mind that I bcc'ed you but I hoping that you would have this info at hand.

 

Thanks in advance to all for your help.

 

Wayne

'79 Westy
