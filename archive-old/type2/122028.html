Subject: Re: [T2] type IV fan fell off

Hello Bob    I have seen this before  It normally messes up the slot for the 
woodruff key and the key itself. also check the hub,  I have fixed some of 
these using Locktite quick metal  and using a center punch to seat the key by 
center punching on both sides of the key. Also use red locktite on the bolt when 
reinstalling it.  You could have problems with the hub lining back up properly 
which will throw your timing marks off.  Worse case you will have to replace 
the crank. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va
