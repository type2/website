Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Windshield crack while washing - buying glass

Careful on the seal. We have instqalled some of them from local places and  
the rubber isn't real wide form windshield post to windshield. So sometimes on  
the bottom corners the rubber hardly if not at all don't sit on it and the  
rubber curls in. I don't know for sure if it's the rubber or the glass is a bit 
 short. We bought some rubber from one of the aftermarket places and the 
rubber  was wider and we used that. It worked. Just like many of us the glass 
companys  don't buy the best they buy the cheapest. Just a FYI
