Subject: Re: [T2] Costco's Kirkland Tires - Any experiences?

Hi,

I,m suddenly concerned because I,m planning on buying Yokohama # 37047
tires which are the same rating
as those Costco's Kinkland tires that Kevin mentioned ( LT 195/75/R14 ).

I have a new '76 Bus and will be driving the family from Toronto to
Mexico next year.
Should I be concerned about instability ? I want stability and safety.
Has anyone had any
experience with these Yokohamas ? Is there another tire I should
consider ?
