&gt; I would trust Berg's engineering. However, I have found his prices to be a
&gt; trifle on the high side. I am getting a pump cover with the fitting for
like
&gt; $15 Canadian, which is like $10USD. I'm getting a filter base for $15
also,
&gt; which is very cheap. Anything from Berg is like $100-150USD, which is
pretty
&gt; steep. I have read of his pressure relief cover, sounds like just the
&gt; ticket. Tom

This Berg part is around $40 ( that's like $240 Cdn:).
You can make your own pump cover by welding a fitting.( $2 Cdn :).
I assume you will go the inexpensive route and use clamped
hoses and barb fittings. Check the pressure spec on that set-up !
Would you use it for a garden hose ?!

&gt; Berg has an oil pressure relief oil pump cover
&gt; which limits pump output to 125 psi ( and returns
&gt; excess to the pump inlet ) for full-flow application.
&gt; This could also be 90 psi, depending on where you read it.
&gt; The minimal downside is that hot oil is recycled through
&gt; the pump until it is delivered to the filter.
