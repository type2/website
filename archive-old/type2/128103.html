Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS UPDATES: (Was Re: [T2] Hi all - long)

&gt; Did you actually talk to the people, or just verify that their phone
&gt; numbers were valid? I ask becouse they only wait like six months or so
&gt; I think before they give out a disconnected number again. So just
&gt; becouse a number is valid, and hooked up, doesn't mean the person who
&gt; has it is the same person who signed up for AIRS.

the contacts will need to be verified and updated.
what I did was first send an email with the airs data attached and asked
if the contact info was still valid. then worked my way through the
failed emails  with phone calls etc....
its a pretty big job. i think perhaps 50-80% of the contacts are bad.
