Subject: [T2] Free Backissues of Hot-VW magazine - GONE

&gt; So they're free to the first person who p-mails me
&gt; (busdepot_at_email_dot_com), but you have to pay the shipping cost. ....


Sorry folks, they're gone.  I got enough responses within one hour to have
given away 500 more if I had them. Wish I had 'em...
