I finally fired-up the BA6 that's been lurking under the floor of my
Westfalia.  The PO had disconnected the fuel lines and the ground to the
main switch.  I re-connected the fuel lines and ground, and it started up.
Well, almost.  It's not getting any power to the fuel pump.  I rigged a
jumper for the test and the pump began working just fine.  Shortly
thereafter, the heater ignited.  I now need to replace the exhaust pipe and
the fuel line from the pump to the heater.  Does anyone know the proper
sizes for these?  I've checked the manuals in the Type2 library, but haven't
been able to find the specs.  The fuel line looks like the same diameter
used on the fuel return lines on a Rabbit diesel.  How long should the
exhaust pipe be, and what diameter?

As soon as I sort out the pump wiring problem, I'll be set.  More
accurately, after I drill-out the six bottom-pan bolts that snapped rather
than unscrew, and replace them, along w/the fuel line and exhaust, THEN I'll
be set.
