Subject: Washing/Cleaning Engine ('77 FI)

hey now,

one of the things i've done with the new '77 westy is to replace the gasket on
the oil blow off box. the old one was in pieces and was the cause (i think) of
the oil on the case and surrounding area. today i started cleaning the engine
of all dirt, oil, dust, leaves (from the local mice). i'm using purple stuff
and engine foam and it's coming along slowly. what i really need to do is to
spray it off with water once i let the cleaners sit. but i'm wondering if this
is safe to do. how to you folks clean your engines? i imagine i need to cover
up all electrical stuff...opinions/thoughts greatly appreciated!
