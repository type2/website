&gt; There is another issue.  There needs to be a minimum deck height of
something like 0.035&quot;.  In the two engines I have personally rebuilt, the
deck height was only about 0.025&quot; without the &quot;head gasket&quot;.  So I would say
that a shim should always be installed under the barrel to make up for the
thickness of the head gasket unless deck height is re-evaluated.

I would say that deck height must be re-evaluated first
to determine the necessity of a shim under the barrels.
Barrel shims supplied with aftermarket gasket sets
are .010&quot;, while the head gaskets are more like .035&quot;
Removal of the head gasket will raise CR by .1 on a 2L
.025&quot; deck height is too close for me.
Both heads should be checked for combustion chamber
volumes when one is replaced. Rebuilt heads may have
been flycut, and this can be a significant factor in CR.
