&gt; By the way, I was wondering, what is the proper way to spell Westphalia,
&gt; I have seen it written both ways, with a &quot;ph&quot; and with a

I thinks the proper way is with an &quot;f&quot; because with the &quot;ph&quot; you are 
implying that your camper has something to do with male genitalia.
