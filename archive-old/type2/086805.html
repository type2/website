Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filler hose

Richard,

I bought 2 1/4&quot; (58mm) &quot;gas filler hose&quot; from the local NAPA store.
None of the other flaps carried that size.


I have pictures for my gas tank write-up.  It is fairly expensive as you
*have* to buy a foot($21.00).  It does work.  I need to go back and pull
mine and take a picture of how I cut it to fit even better since it does
not bend very well.  

It really doesn't need to bend too much though.  It also has wire
reinforcement inside of it.  You cut it with a very sharp knife and then
clip the wires and clean the excess up on a grinder.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I searched the archives and I was wondering if there have been any updates
&gt; on the extinct fuel filler hose (211-201-125D) that connects the tank to the
&gt; filler neck on late bay models?
&gt; 
&gt; It seems there are a few options and I'm looking for leads:
&gt; 
&gt; - make/find a substitute piece
&gt; 
&gt; - hunt down one from VW for a lot of money if you can find it -- anyone have
&gt; a dealer number that carried one they bought?
&gt; 
&gt; - wait for the repro that is in the works -- when?
&gt; 
&gt; - use the Vanagon part and cut it to spec -- What's the part number?
