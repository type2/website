Anyone out there rebuild steering boxes? Quite a chunk of change to buy a new rebuild.

Mine has that horrible popping sound. and lots of play; haven't messed with the adjusting screw, though can't account for what the previous owner(s) did.

Another question, what is this little metal piece that fell out of my turn signal switch? its about 3/4&quot; square with a notch in one side. BTW the turn signals don't work. I can't figure out how it fits in there.

IN SEARCH OF:  Interior door and kick panels, headliner for '70 Westy. also stereo &amp; speakers. Email if you have got.

Much obliged...

Will
