Subject: Where are cheap + cool campsites

Hello everyone,

My family and I will be driving from Toronto, Ontario, down the eatern
seaboard, across
the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico, down through Texas and finally
into Mexico.
I've been looking at &quot; RV Park and family campgrounds of America &quot; on
the internet
and find that it will cost around $25 - $30 per night for our VW bus and
tent.
These campgrounds range from 40 - 800 RV sites in size, and they all
have cable
hook-ups, game rooms, hot tubs, swimming pools, big screen tv's etc.

My question is; are there alternative campgrounds that are perhaps
smaller, unusual,
and cheaper through the US ? Where do bus folk go when traveling ? How
does one
find these places ?

Thanks for any help.
