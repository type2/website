Subject: Re: [T2] poptop seals

I got mine at the Bus Depot and I'm happy with them. See Bentley for 
installation procedure...even though it maddeningly doesn't include 
info for 1974 and later campers (info wasn't available at publication 
date?!?)

I still haven't figured out how to install the flat seal that runs 
along the front edge of the poptop. One edge of the seal is flat, the 
other has a cusp along the edge. I assume that the cusp is supposed to 
face the front of the bus? Anyone?

(See illustration: http://www_dot_deadbus_dot_org/diaries/archives/000059.html )

&gt; Hi:
&gt;
&gt; I'm missing the seal on the poptop on my 78 campmobile, and the ones 
&gt; on the front section of the roof are somewhat ratty. I'm guess I'm 
&gt; going to install new ones all the way around.
&gt;
&gt; Any recommendations about which seals to buy?
