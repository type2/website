	Should be hyd lifters, according to the PO. Which is consistent with
what I know about the engine. the PO also indicated that the engine had
recently had new lifters put on. I am not sure if the valve burned
before or after this. Could a bad lifter cause this problem? It appears
that all the rest of the cylinders seem a ok, just the problem with
this one.
