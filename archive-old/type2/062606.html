&gt;i'm tired of the single weber carb on my '74 1800cc bus. didn't the 74 have
&gt;dual carbs as stock?

Yes, except some automatics supposedly had fuel injection.  I've never seen
one though.

&gt;it is my understanding that with dual carbs i'll get better milage and more
&gt;power. how much, i'm not sure. so, should i go to dual or try a different
&gt;single carb...or does mine need rebuilding?

Hard to say.  I only get about 16/18 mpg city/highway with the dual Solexes
on the two liter, but they are jetted real rich now.  I used to be able to
get 20-21 on the highway with the same carbs jetted differently on the
1800.  If you're getting 18, you're not too badly, IMO.  You might also
want to consider your driving style.  I've been trying to improve my
mileage by driving differently, with no success yet.  :)
