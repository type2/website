Subject: Re: Qu on Detecting misfiring plugs

&gt;Quoth Rick Taylor
&gt;&gt;&gt; Always use Bosch plugs, Champions have an extra thread at the bottom
&gt;&gt;&gt;and will carbon up, then when you take the plug out, the carbon in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;thread can ruin the threads in the head.&lt;&lt;
&gt; Now you tell me!  This happened to us on a bug motor once.
&gt;BTW,  1. using a strobe timing light that clips over the plug wire, will
&gt;it always not flash under either condition (shorting in cap vs shorting
&gt;in plug)- or will a shorted plug still flash the light since the current
&gt;is getting thru to ground but bypassing the gap???  If it still will
&gt;flash, how can you detect the shorting plug besides noting it's wet or
&gt;detecting that the cylinder is not doing its share?
&gt;2. What if plug is misfiring only at high rpms- any way to detect
&gt;this?????

The best way to test for a bad wire is with the Ohm test.  If you have the
resistor end on your plug wire, you will have to add in for that.  BTW, I
have found a number of those ends loose where they screw onto the wires.

As far as checking the plug for not firing under extreme conditions, the
only check I know of is to replace with a plug that you know is working
well.  The ignition system must be checked and bad components replaced
regular.

An engine out of tune not only burns more fuel, but runs hotter and with
much less power.  Don't get cheap when replacing parts, you'll pay for it!!
