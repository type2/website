Hi list, 

Sorry to bother all of you, but I am looking for
advice about buying a bus.  I am currently checking
out a 1977 standard bus with 150,000 on the original
1800 cc engine.  I haven't test driven or looked at
the engine yet, and the body looked solid with only a
small patch of rust on the rear passenger side.  The
parking brake also doesn't work but I didn't think
that was much of a problem. My questions are: 

1)How long do 1800 cc engines usually last before they
need a rebuild? And how much would a rebuild be?

2)Does anyone know of a good mechanic in San Francisco
where I could get an inspection done?

3)How much would fixing the parking brake cost and
could I do it myself?

It really is a beautiful bus and I have been dying to
own a bus my entire life.  Any suggestions would be
greatly appreciated, even reading material.  I've
skimmed the John Muir Volkswagon's for Idiots book but
would love to hear any other recommendations.

Thanks,

Tesa
