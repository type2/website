&gt;The hitches for '68-'71 Busses are a direct bolt on part.  There are
&gt;threaded holes on the outside of the frame extensions for the outer 2 pieces
&gt;of the unit.  Those 2 pieces hug the frame above the bumper brackets.  Then
&gt;the center bar bolts between those 2 pieces.  The tongue has a bolt hole for
&gt;a matching hole in the bottom of the bumper.

And they also float around at swap meets.  I bought one for $25 (NOS VW)
2-3 years back inadvertently not looking closely at what it was as the box
was mistagged as for a '73-'79.

They are out there.

John
