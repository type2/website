Subject: engine types, oil temps and thermostats

Steve,
As for the thermostat you run, it will depend more on the cooling fan and tin
rather than the engine.
If you have a type 3 motor in you bus, what cooling does it run? The type 3
cooling fan &amp; tin ware, or the fan etc from a type 1?
That will determine the thermostat you run and how it works.
Richard,
Brisbane Australia
