Subject: RE: [T2] Boddy Rubber

now, I'm new to this list and from what I've from the knowedgable resposnes 
I have been reading form some of you, I can say with certainty I am far from 
the brightest feller here. My two pesos on the subject of your adhesive from 
MUCH time spent working with sealants and adhesives for a major airline 
manufacturer is this:
NEVER attempt to apply a new adhesive on top of an old adhesive. even if you 
use the exact same type of adhesive to bond to the old adhesive, you will 
not get a proper chemical reaction between the two, and your stuff will not 
stay put. you can go to an autobody supply store and buy some MEK (methyl 
ethyl ketone) which is a deadly carcinogene but highly effective for 
cleaning sealants, and will soften the old paint and allow for a good bond 
(or MPK [methyl propyl ketone] is a somewhat evironmently safer alternative 
because of a slower evaporation time). if you clean down to bare metal and 
are concerned about future rust problems, you could wipe the area clean, 
then wipe the metal with Ospho which will prevent the metal from rusting if 
you then paint over it. I have used this alot on my previous VW 
restorations. Basically it changes the chemical properties of rust, turning 
iron oxide to iron phosphate. any residual rust on the area would turn kind 
of a blackish color and not rust any further, then you paint over it and BAM 
the rest of the car can disintegrate around the affected area but the 
treated area wont change.

of course, when using these cleaning agents, I cannot stress enough to use 
in a well ventilated area, and preferably get a respirator (like 30-50 bucks 
at the auto supply store). the correct filters for the respirator will 
generally be purple in color to denote that they are capable of filtering 
the small organic particles of the solvents and whatnot (havnt bought these 
in a few years now so the standard could have changed). and use proper 
gloves. latex surgical gloves are NOT adequate. you should use higher rated 
gloves also available at the autobody supply shop and they are not 
prohibitvly expense. ounce of prevention dontchaknow.
