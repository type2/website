Just to make you feel good, My uncle died from asbestosis about 2 years ago,
but he was working for a ship yard &amp; used to mix it up &amp; plaster it onto
pipework etc..... On the other hand I have worked with old asbestos &amp; even
did a stint working in asbestos removal. Either way, you or I will not know
whether we will choke to death for at least 30+ years.

Happy thoughts- :)
