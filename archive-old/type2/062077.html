Hi Volks,

So I wrote:

I'll come! Mexico 1 is the road to adventure if ever there were one. 

I was bitten by the Baja travel bug a few years ago. Four years ago 
I made a solemn promise to myself to return to Scorpion Bay every year 
until I die, or score epic surf. Of course, if I ever score epic surf there,
I'll be going back for the rest of my life anyway. I'm heading down in about
two weeks for this year's pilgrimage. 

I surf and July is prime time for playing the &quot;camp on a remote beach and wait 
for south swells&quot; lottery. Sometimes they come and sometimes they don't, but you
can't win if you don't play. 

To camp with such distinguished company in Baja would be an honor.
Besides when travelling Baja in a VW bus, strength in numbers is a safety 
thing. Baja has more than its share of dead buses bleaching their bones in the
hot Mexican sun. My dear old '79 Westy is among them. In fact, the imperative 
to be capable of fixing ANYTHING with no backup in the Baja desert is what led 
me into my practical enrollment in the VW School of Hard Knocks (and other 
Expensive Noises).

In my experience, the hardest part about Baja is actually getting a good crew to
come along. Amazing how many weddings, job changes, and other circumstances 
conspire to keep working age people from being available during a given two
week period. I'll do my best to keep my calendar free.

I've never been more than about 3/4 of the way down. Cabo here we come!
More as the time approaches.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
