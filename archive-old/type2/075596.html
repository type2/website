Subject: Re: [T2] Meters

One quick comment about meters: A very important yet so far unmentioned
point on any meter is how the test leads plug in. No matter what, make sure
the meter accepts test leads with &quot;banana plugs.&quot; Banana plugs (no, I don't
know why they're called that) are available in bags at any electronics
store. Get a bag of them and make a handful of test leads. One set will have
push-ons for test probes. Another will have alligator clips. Still others
will have whatever connector you want to use. Also make a set of leads
that's long enough to reach from the back of your Bus to the driver's seat.

A set of 25-foot test leads that's got push-ons for test probes is one of my
very favorite tools. You can hook 'em up to whatever you want in the engine
bay, get in the driver's seat and operate the controls.
