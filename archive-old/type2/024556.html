X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hey Y'all,
  Sometimes on the list we seen to point out the negitive things that people
do, bad service, flame wars, etc. Well I would like to mention a good
service that was provided to me.
  Joe Cali, owner of Next Generation, has written a book titled &quot;the Type IV
Upright Convertion Manual&quot; I shows how to modify a type 4 motor to fit into
a Bug, Ghia, or pre 71 Bus. This book is loaded with information on the
convertion. It shows how to do it with stock type 1 and type 4 parts saving
you loads of money. Do not expect pretty full color pictures here, just
great black and white text and diagrams. I sent off my $34 and got the book
1 week later. 
  If you want more power out of your early Bus, Bug or Ghia, you must get
this book.  Go to http://home.att_dot_net/~Nextgen
  I just wanted to pass this on.
