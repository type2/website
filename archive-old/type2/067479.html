Okay, my bus is 300 miles away, waiting for me to pick it up. It's cold out,
I'm recovering from pneumonia, and I'm bored. So this idea of a Bus Birthday
party is really starting to rap-tap-tap at my brain (that would be the April
23, 1997 party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Pon's visit to VWAG
where he laid out plans for the bus). If we were to try to pull off a big
bus bash, drawing listees from all over the country, where would we hold it?
(Please inform me: I'm sure someone else is probably already planning this,
but who?)

Here are some nominations:

Mark Twain National Forest (near Springfield, MO)
Ozark National Forest (NW Arkansas)
Colorado (in one of the many parks)

Right now, I'm just thinking about geographic locations. What would be
really cool, though, is to find a relatively remote location where people
were bus-friendly and sort of take over a town/park. The downside of using a
state or national park, of course, is that they frown on magnesium fires.
