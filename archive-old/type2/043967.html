&gt;  Sounds like just a slimy way to void the warranty of any engine when
&gt;  it fails after a short service life.

My first and last GEX engine had one of these tell-tales stuck to the rear
of the oil sump on the left side.

It managed to stay intact through 40,000 carefully-maintained miles (in a
bug) until a head failure prompted removal of the engine.  As delivered,
the bottom end of the engine
was loose enough that the oil light would come on after a half-hour 
freeway drive in summer (after the engine returned to idle)

As I removed the engine, I used a rag to wipe the tell-tale and it came
off in my hand intact.  Seems that they just glue the thing to the silver
paint that they slap on the case.  The tell-tale was still securely glued
to the paint, but the paint peeled off of the case.

BTW, GEX still owes me the Bentley manual they were giving away with each
rebuilt as a promotion.  Seems that they had &quot;just run out&quot; when I bought
my engine, but they would put one in the mail to me as soon as they came
in.  I'm not holding my breath!
