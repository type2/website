Subject: Re: [T2] oil cooler tin seal

From: Richard Atwell
&gt; I removed this seal in order to paint the tin it was attached to. What's a
 good sealant to use to reattach it?

It sits on the lip of the tin. It always stays in place for me. Once you mount the tin, it is held tight by
the oil cooler.
