Subject: rust repair

Hello all. Hope this is of some interest.

I'm in the process of trying to revive my 70 westy. Upon disassembly, I 
found a lot of rust under the front windshield seal, and driver's side rear 
window seal. I am now cutting the rust out and hope to weld in new material. 
The interesting thing here is that I've never done this sort of thing 
before. But, so far, so good, although I haven't actually got around to the 
welding part yet. My welding experience is limited to oxy/fuel, however, I 
am going to buy an inexpensive mig unit ($300) for this job. I figure I 
really can't lose: I was going to junk the bus, but if I can fix it, I'd 
love to put it back on the road. We've had a lot of good times together. I 
have a suspicion that a lot of buses meet their maker because of rust under 
the window seals. I'll keep you posted.
