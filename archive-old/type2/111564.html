Subject: RE: [T2] help! - CD install

if you don't want to cut the opening on the dash, try filing it.
i have sucessfully installed 2 bus radios with this technique.
it doesn't mar up the dash like a blade would.

also, my new-to-me 69 single cab has the under dash mount for the 
radio installed by the PO.  very clean looking &amp; i would suggest that
if you don't want to alter the stock opening.

good luck,

Joel Wilson
