&gt; First, according to Bentley, the 75-78 style exhaust was intended to
&gt; improve &quot;ease of installation and removal&quot; and improve &quot;heat output for
&gt; the passenger compartment.&quot; Were they kidding?

Ease of installation is they now bolt on with 3 bolts instead of the 72 and
prior 4 bolts.
Reminds me of a joke

    These 2 guys are flying in a plane when all of a sudden there is fire on
the right side of the plane and the whole plane shakes.  The Captain comes
on the intercom and says &quot;We have just lost engine #3 and will be a hour
late to our destinataion.  They are flying along and all of a sudden there
is fire on the left side of the plane and the whole plane shakes.  The
Captain comes on the intercom and says &quot;We have just lost engine #2 and will
be 2 hours late to our destinataion.   The one guy turns to his friend and
says &quot;IF we keep losintg these engines we are going to be up here all day!&quot;
