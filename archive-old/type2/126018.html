Subject: Re: [T2] true Porsche engine vs Type IV

&gt; so with lots of people calling the Type IV engine a Porsche engine, 
&gt; when it

&gt; Type IV engine

Case # is a pretty good indicator.  Of course, you can use a VW-flavor 
case to build a Porsche-flavor Type 4, or a Porsche-flavor case to 
build a VW-flavor Type 4.  Also check part #s on the heads.

OTOH, if you count 6 cylinders and see an external oil tank, then 
chances are you definitely have a Porsche (though not 914) engine :-)
