Subject: re: [T2] Knock knock...cv joint know-how


If yer gonna pull things apart, I'd like to pass along this advice:

A) Have a look at the following:
http://volksweb.relitech_dot_com/cvjoints.htm

B) The bolts; clean the heads out good before taking a tool to them. 
Whack each with a good blow to help 'unstick' them from the
hub/transmission.  Check if it is a 6 (hex) or 12-point bolt head and
use the correct tool.

C) Reassembling the CV joint; they only go together correctly one way. 
Remember the words 'narrow-to-wide' (this is covered on the above
page.).

D) If you buy new joints, don't disassemble them.  Put 'em on and grease
'em up.


The way to reverse the CV joints is to pull both axles and swap the
right wheel-side cv joint for the left wheel-side one.  This will spin
each wheel-side cv joint in the opposite direction.

&gt; 
&gt; Greetings to the List,
&gt; 
&gt; And my thanks to Sean, Al, Greg, Allen, Don, and Andy for their replies to my 
&gt; first Knock knock posting.  Guys, I am going to check the torque on those 
&gt; rear wheel nuts.  But, assuming the worst, and the CVs do need a little TLC, 
&gt; do you have any tips or tricks in dealing with these little monsters?  I'm 
&gt; spending my free time getting educated and reading Haynes, Bentley, and Muir 
&gt; (I've never tackled CVs before) but I'm wondering if any of you have 
&gt; &quot;special&quot; advice for a first-timer on this job.  I'm thinking I should be 
&gt; looking for scoring like on bearings...........what else?
&gt; 
&gt; Al, you mentioned switching the CVs.  How exactly does one switch them 
&gt; around?  Is that kinda like rotating tires - a special pattern involved?  Any 
&gt; particular grease recommended?  Any particular replacement boot?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks guys.  With a little help and moral support I just might be able to 
&gt; get through this little job.
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
