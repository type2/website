Subject: Re: [T2] Battery or Connection Problem?

Classic symptoms of a connection problem with one of the primary battery cables.  Try wiggling the terminals and wiring at the battery and starter.  Leave something on, like lights or radio so you will have an indication when the power comes back.

It has also happened to me once that the battery had an internal short, with the same symptoms.  But the connection problem has happened several times over the years, so the odds are with that.  :-)
