Subject: Brake Booster removal; replacement


I am about to remove my brake servo and my steering dampner to use one of
rustybus' tow bars. (It clamps to the crossbeam and these items would
interfere with it, which is not uncommon with towbars.)

 In my Bentley manual, it yells at you that if you remove this item, you
must rebuild it (replace the filter, a seal and o-rings).

 Is that strictly correct? Can I safely remove this thing and put it back
the way I found it, without doing that? Any advice?

I sure don't want to spend the $160 or so to get a rebuilt one...after I
screw it up.

Thanks
 Chuck
