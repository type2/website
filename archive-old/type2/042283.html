Subject: Re: valve springs

&gt; In converting a '77 solid lifter head (donor engine) into a '78 hydraulic
&gt; lifter head (target engine, MUST I change the valve springs??
&gt;
&gt; I noticed that the valve springs are different in RMMW catalog, so should
I
&gt; buy new springs??
&gt;
&gt; I guess the question is, what is the diffrence between solid lifter and
&gt; hydraulic lifter valve springs.

The hydraulic lifter valve springs are stiffer. I 'believe' VW put them in
to prevent the lifters from pumping up if you floated the valves. By this I
mean if you over-rev the engine, the valves will move so fast that they
would float and you would loose the spring tension to hold the lifter down.
The cam would turn turn so fast that the ramp speed on the closing side of
the lobe would be faster then the speed of the lifter following it. Oil
pressure would then extend the lifter plunger out to the end of its travel
and the valve would stay open. Zero compression!

Would I buy new springs?
No, the solid springs on my 77 Westy work fine with hydraulic lifters. I
have had no problems with them and it has run this way for 64,000 miles.
My daughters 77 Westy has the same set-up and she has had no problems for
over 50,000 miles.
And both of these are solid lifter cams.....all I changed was the lifters,
pushrods, and put the spacers,wave and flat washers between the rocker arms.
[68- 79 Bentley section 5, page 62, figure 17-8] I set the preload at 1
turn.
