&gt; Wouldn't that be from Tobermory to South Bay Mouth on Manitoulin Island?  I 
believe 
&gt; the only claim to fame of Blind River is that it is mentioned in a Neil Young 
song.  
&gt; I grew up in Sault Ste. Marie so I know Blind River as &quot;one of the places you 
have to 
&gt; go THROUGH  to get anywhere else; nothing more; nothing less&quot; ;-)
&gt; -- 
&gt;And what a Neil Young song it is!  A song to an old car he once had, so
&gt;I guess he's our kind of guy :) .  &quot;Well it was back in Blind River in
&gt;1962 when I last saw you alive...&quot;

&gt;The song is appropriately titled &quot;Long May You Run&quot; :)
