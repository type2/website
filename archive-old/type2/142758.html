Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel oil

Keeping with the oil theme here...

I'm switching back to straight 30w. My experiment in synthetic blended
oil resulted in the rear main seal going out. Granted it's probably 30
years old and ready to go out anyway, but it's awfully convenient that
500 miles into my experiment the seal goes.

I just love having oil blowing all over the cooling fins. :-|

As for multi-grade oils, I've used several variations over the years
and always been happier with single grade oils. I had a 76 280z that
had maintenance records from day one with straight 30w. At 250k it
still had lots of compression and ran beautifully. I saw no reason to
change...
