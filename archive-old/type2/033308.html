Now now...not to resurect the dead, here, but...;)

185 x .78 = 144.3
195 x .75 = 146.25

this is your sidewall height.  True, this DOES vary from manufacture and
model....but.

I can attest to the fact that the Y370 195/75 is definitly more massive
(even when worn out) then my 195/75 Bridgestone 603s...  Taller
(slightly!) and wider. (as wide as the oooold E78 or something like that
bias plies i took off...kmart specials.;)


but i digress.;)
