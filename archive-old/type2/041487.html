Subject: Road Noise Reduction &amp; Insulation

Hey List,

I'm looking to reduce the amount of noise and hoping to not have gale force
winds through my bus this winter.  I have been reading about insulating
panels that you can use to cover problem areas (wheel wells and large flat
metal surfaces according to the book I was reading).  My idea is to pull
everything out of the Westy, lay the insulation, and re-install.  Taking
special time to cover the wheel wells, gaps near the emergency
break/shifter, and the deck just above the engine.  Does anyone have any
experience with this?  Any helpfull tips?

Thanks,

Darrin K. Pierce
