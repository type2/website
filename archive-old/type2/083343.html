Subject: Timing question (again)


Last week I posted a question about timing my bus.
Unfortunately, I lied to you all. What I thought 
was a stock distributor is really a mechanical advance one (I can't
find my Bentley right now and I don't know where the part number is
marked, so I'm not sure exactly which one I have.)

Anyway, I timed it by feel last week, as my timing light was not working.
Today I got the timing light working and checked it. To recap, I timed
it by advancing it to max RPM at idle, then backed it off 4 degrees.
I've been driving it gently since then, and it's been doing fine.

Today I checked it and it was advanced 20 degrees at idle (900rpm).
I retarded it to 10 ATDC per Muir and then the old problems came back --
rough idle after it warms up and almost no power (0-60 took over
a minute where it used to take about 25 seconds, and it maxes out at just
over 60MPH on flats, 50-55 going over overpasses.)

This didn't seem right to me at all, so I advanced it to TDC at idle.
I checked it at 3000 RPM and it's advanced 24 degrees. Power is back
and it idles fine when warm nows, but I'm back to wondering if this
is good for the engine or not. Does that advance curve sound scary?

I do have a stock distributor on my spare engine, and will probably
install that soon, but in the meantime I need to drive to Portland
tomorrow (120 miles each way) and would rather not blow up the engine
in the process. Opinions?

Oh, the engine is a 1.8l, dual carb, manual tranny.
