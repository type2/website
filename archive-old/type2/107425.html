Subject: RE: [T2] bowden tube bend

I don't have the book handy, but the allowable tolerance on the tube bend is
pretty large. As long as you're within that you should be fine. If you do
exceed the tolerance, you could remove some spacer washers.

I went to my vw FLAPS and picked up a new bowden tube because my
originals were gettin' kinda nasty.  I noticed that it's slightly longer
(about 3/4cm) and therefore has a bigger bend.  The cable doesn't have
any major kinks and runs in a smooth curve.  Pedal action is nice and
smooth...

Think this will be ok or am I looking at frequent cable breaks?
