&gt;  Replaced coil w/ known good one (took
&gt; it off my functional bug) and still had no spark. Tested ignition lead- have
&gt; 12V to coil when key is on. Checked lead from condenser to (--) side of coil
&gt; - found juice there whether points are open, closed, etc.

There will be voltage there as the points are the switch and downstream.

I'd try another set of points, you may have a defective set where the insulation
is shorting out.
