Ok..seems I have to remove the oil filler tube at the case. do I need to 
drain the oil if I do this? I have the 3 pieces of rear engine tin removed 
already. Where do I disconnect the wire to the starter?? the Po has a mess 
of wires and I see that there a bunch of things spliced into the wiring 
harness. Do I remover the wire right at the starter? Cause I looked and 
didn't see any way to remove it.

thanks,
