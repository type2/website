I had this same problem and I obtained a new spindle assembly which
contained all the worn out parts.  The part # is 211-998-161E.  It is
readily available in the UK.  You will also need a new seal (grommet).

&gt; I've got a '73 bus with a wiper problem.  Specifically, the 
&gt; POs never lubed 
&gt; the wiper shafts and over time they've seized and caused the 
&gt; bearing shafts 
&gt; to rotate with them.
