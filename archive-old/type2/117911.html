Subject: [T2] clickety-clickety-clickety steering noise


 Lately the steering in my 78 has been making a funny noise. It kind of 
 makes a clickety-clickety-clickety noise. I can feel it in the steering 
 wheel. This happens while I'm turning the steering wheel. It happens 
 mainly if I am moving the bus around to park it, but it does not make 
 the noise when I am driving. Also, it is intermittent. Sometimes it 
 makes the noise. Other times I can move the bus around and there is no 
 noise at all.
 
 Any thoughts? Thanks.
