&gt;Does anyone know the standard sizes of the o-rings for the type 2 engine?  i.e. what size are the o-rings on the pushrod tubes

The push rod o-rings are roughly 3mm thick with 22m ID and 25mm ID.

&gt;My goal is to be able to go to any o-ring seller and give them a size, without having to attempt to measure a hardened or cracked oring.  I've looked at the archived lists and couldn't find any info.

Maybe you'll find a bargain but I've found busing a set of Viton o-rings from an online VW parts vendor cheaper than buying them as singles or in packs of 10.
