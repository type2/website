&gt; A relay can be bought to solve this.
&gt; It works as follows.
&gt; The wire that would normally activate your solenoid on starter goes to the
&gt; relay.
&gt; A wire from your + side of battery goes to the relay.
&gt; A wire goes from the relay to the terminal on the starter solenoid.
&gt; The last wire goes from the relay to ground.
&gt; When you turn your key the juice from your ignionswitch goes through the
&gt; relay to ground and closes the circuit in the relay allowing battery juice
&gt; to flow 4 feet directly from battery to the starter through the relay
rather
&gt; than 24 feet from back of bus to front and back again through 30 year old
&gt; wires.
&gt; Mine is a chrysler part I bought for $7, it came with a schematic to make
it
&gt; simple.
&gt; This fix is assuming you have checked all other possibillities.(starter
&gt; loose, dirty connections, bus is mad at you:-)
&gt; Good luck

&gt;
&gt; &gt; The bus in question is older but the question relates, my bus will start
&gt; up
&gt; &gt; every morning and run me to work.  Usually it will restart but often it
&gt; will
&gt; &gt; just click, and then I grab a screwdriver and flashlight, crawl under
and
&gt; &gt; cross the starter and vroom.  What gives??
