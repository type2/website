Subject: 911 fan shroud conversion for T4 engine...

I was looking around on the California Import website, and saw this...

http://store.cip1_dot_com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=cali&amp;
Product_Code=ACC-C10-5991&amp;Category_Code=02-06-01-02

It is a retrofit top tin section for running a 911 fan/alternator and cooling 
system on a Type 4 engine.

Anyone ever seen one in action or used one? It is awfully expensive for my 
tastes, but I have always like the look of the 911 engine's big fan, and 
flowing top tin......just a thought for the new year.

Take care all, and have a great new year. Thanks for all your help, advice, 
and friendship. Our local Air cooled scene has dwindled to two shops as of 
now, and neither are of much help anymore. I consider myself as a 
quasi-novice-mechanic, and really have been astounded with the amount of 
knowledge and advice that is generated by the type2 list serve. I would 
definitely be a couple steps behind in my resto without you all.

Take care and god bless,
