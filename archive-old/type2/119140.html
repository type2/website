Subject: Three point seat belts in the back of a 76 westy

Has anyone ever put three point belts in the back of a bay window westy.It
seems there is a mounting point for them but they are below the seat
level(below shoulder level).This to me doesnt seem right.On the driver side
in my 76 there is a cooler between the seat and the wall where the mounting
point is supposed to be.It seems to me that in an accident a three point
belt mounted to this location would just throw a passenger to the side of
the bus.Has anyone worked a solution for this problem.My daughter has
outgrown carseats and the way my son is growing it wont take him long either
so if Im gonna take them camping Im gonna have to work something out.Any
suggestions appreciated.Thanks
