Subject: Re: [T2] 34pict3 not adjusting

Fred is right on the money. I blew the plug out if the 30pict in the 
old 1969 bus. John and I spent an hour or two messing with 34pict 3 
on the '67. Two things to check. 1) As already stated make sure the 
carb if firmly and flatly mated to the manifold with a good gasket. 
2) Get your 17mm box end wrech out and make that cut-off solenoid is 
snug and I mean snug. With those to items corrected we were able to 
use the big screw to accurately set the idle.

Good luck.
