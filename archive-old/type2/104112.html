Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pressure testing

--Richard,

I don't know, but I bought a gauge with an american size fitting crimped on the end of a 3/8&quot; diameter hose and just cut off the fitting. I push the 3/8&quot; hose on the stub and clamp off.

Not mechanically beautiful, but functional for once annual use...

Billy
