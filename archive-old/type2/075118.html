Subject: Re: [T2] Oil filler gasket on a pancake engine

Just recently replace it. It can be removed/replace w/ the engine in
place, but i wasn't able to get it to ebey my will w/out removing the
mustache bar. everything was just hunky-dory after that. there is one
stud in the block &amp; one on the tube casting as well. the gasket I bought
for it was (071 115 315A) and it worked just fine. You also might want
to look at replaceing the dip stick boot (021 119 245) as well. YMMV and
my bus is a 79 2 liter.

p.s. I forgot i also had the exchangers off so pulling the mustache bar
wasn't an issue for me. i think it can be made to be forced up there
w/out removing anything else other than the tin around the neck, i just
didn't want to break anything.

&gt; Also, it looks like 2 bolts to take it off and replace.  Am I correct or
&gt; will this be a big PITA?  Can it be done with the engine in?
