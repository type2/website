Actually HP is not a product of a T IV engine, however Torque is......We
have good TI combinations, but the TIV  engines will outlive them 2 to
1.....

&gt; Will a 283 Chevy fit into an Auston Healey? Yes.
&gt; Will a 455 Pontiac fit into a 1954 Ford? Yes.
&gt; Will a 289 Ford fit into a Nash Rambler? Yes.
&gt; Will a 235 Chevy six fit ito a Truimph Tr3? Yes.
&gt; Will a Corvair Engine fit into a Vanagon? Yes.
&gt; Get your wallet out and wide open, you could shoe horn a hemi chrysler
&gt; into your van if you throw enough money at it.
&gt; Look at old Tommy Ivo, he had an Olds Toronado with both a front and rear
&gt; engine then to beat that he built a car with four engines. Ran like a
&gt; sherman tank but he got the job done.
&gt; Old Juke Raby is getting as much horse power out of his Type2 engines as
&gt; you'll ever get out of a TypeIV.
&gt; Most engine swaps are nightmares and I'm not talking about Tiico. Its the
&gt; homegrown stuff that renders your Van crusher material.

&gt; &gt; Jake Raby said that
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The 2.0 L Type 4 engine will not fit without converting it to upright,
&gt; and fabricating a new type of Mustache bar for the application..Of all
&gt; the vehicles A T IV can be installed into, this one is the roughest.
