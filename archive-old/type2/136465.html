Subject: Re: [T2] Scale for balancing?

I don't wish to raise the ire of an orangutan, but...

Gram scales are readily available in the US. I've three in my ceramic
studio (2 digital, 1 triple beam). I picked up the latest digital from a
scale specialist in the area for about the same price as an Ohaus triple
beam.

&gt; Chris,
&gt; 
&gt; No disrespect, but .1 oz. = 2.8g.  There is no doubt in my mind that the
&gt; chip in these is capable of 1g accuracy, but you would need to buy it in
&gt; any other country on earth to get it wired to display.  If you are close
&gt; to Canada and can slip across the border then I would advise the trip,
&gt; else I would look on the net and gladly pay shipping from a _dot_uk source.
&gt; 
&gt; OOK!
