	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi all!  I've been lurking for some time now on the list - learning lots and
enjoying everyone's contributions.  I had to let my 71 Dormobile sit outside
in a Minnesota winter last year.  Can't stand to do it again this year.
Problem is, the gal doesn't fit into the garage - the doors aren't high
enough.  So, tomorrow the top comes off and she goes in for the winter.
After sizing up the task this afternoon - it doesn't look like that nasty of
a job (is it?).  I am looking for any advice on what to watch for/be careful
with/avoid /problem areas/ personal experiences etc.  Any input would be
greatly appreciated!
Like I said I've been lurking for some time.  This winter I've finally got
the time and money (as well as a work space) to get some things done on her
finally.
So - the farther I get into this winter project, the more 'active' on the
list I'll become  - just a warning ;-).
Thanks in advance!
