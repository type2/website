Subject: [T2] 2 Campers for sale in London

Terry's VW Garage has 2 Campers for sale, both are 1600's. 1 has a full roof
&amp; drives very well good interior etc. £1400

The other is LHD Westphalia with 50000 ORIGINAL MILES, Mint interior &amp; Very
good body work, just a few scratches on bottom. Price is £5900 but I think
that's negotiable. This van is GOOD (I want it BAD), get the bottom
resprayed &amp; you could go &amp; win shows!

Terrys VW is on 020 8567 3165, ask for Luke.
