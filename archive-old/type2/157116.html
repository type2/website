Subject: Re: [T2] Emissions Test Maryland 79 Bus

A couple of years ago, I saw the chairman of Exxon/Mobile (also known  as the boogeyman) on the Charlie Rose Show.  Of course Charlie  starts drilling him with questions about why Exxon, the US Government,  and anybody else with brains didn't spend a ton of money researching  alternative fuels.  Think of all the possibilities, fuel cells,  solar, wind, corn, dead animal corpses, nuclear (oops, sorry, let that  slip).  He didn't bat an eye.  He said that Exxon spends a  lot of money on alternative energy research.  They know that their  product won't be around forever.  But the problem is that the  world uses 80,000,000 barrels of oil each and every day.  We use  1/4 of that, 20,000,000 bbls/day here in the US alone.  And  China's demand is exploding.  Naturally prices are going up.   The problem is that we are nowhere near finding an alternative energy  in such abundance that we can consume the equivalent of 30 billion  barrels of oil annually.  Wind, drop in the bucket. 
 Solar,  same thing.  Probably the best is nuclear.  (oops, there I go  again.)  But we've totally screwed that up in this country.   The green movement has done more harm to the environment than all of  the nuclear reactors in history.  By orders of magnitude.  I  can't wait until I can toss my 1.7L and throw in some kind of fuel cell  motor.  But it's not going to be in the next few years.  And  all the corn in Iowa is not going to make much difference.  We  need to find new sources of oil.  That's the first order of  business.  ANWAR, Gulf of Mexico, my backyard, wherever.   Hey, I need to go set up my drill.  I'm feelin' lucky!   Cheers...KR
