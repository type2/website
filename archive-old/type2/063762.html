Subject: tRusty '69

HI Y'all,
   Well, I am up against a serious rust problem at the jack points on the
'69 Westy.  I'm not about to give up on it, and intend to get it fixed.
The jack point at the driver's side (front) is really gone.  I woulldn't
even think about trying to change a tire using it. I have the '70 yard bus,
which actually still has the jack points intact.  So I want to try to hack
out the good jack points on the '70 and put them on the '69.  I suppose this
can be done without too much trouble, but I cannot do it myself since I don't
have a cutting torch or a welder.  What I need is some pointers from someone
who's BTDT to find out how much I should cut out of the '70, or if I should
even do that at all.  Can you order those jack point bars etc.?  The rust isn't
threatening the frame now, but it will eventually.  What can I expect when
I go down to the body shop and get an estimate?  I hate to let anyone else
touch my busses!! :(  Who was it that got a welder a while back?  Thom F?
Anyone welding honchos out there ever tried to weld a jack point?

   Thanks for any data concerning this matter.

Chris '69, '71 Westys, '70 Bus bones etc.
