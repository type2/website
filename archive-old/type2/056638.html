&gt;Do you set them up so they blow down over the cooling fans?  Also, I

&gt;key-if you have ice, you're insulating the interior from the cooling fins
&gt;and it won't get as cold as you would like.

You set it on the floor of the fridge and it blows air from the bottom of
the fridge up onto the coils.  The reason you have excessive ice on the
coils is because of poor circulation.  With the fan you will not have that
problem because there will be no temperature differential between the top
and the bottom of the fridge (i.e. the top will be warmer than before and
the bottom cooler).
