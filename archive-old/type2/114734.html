Subject: Electric Windshield Washer on '78?

Greetings All:

Does anyone know of a way to install an electric windshield washer on a '78 
bus, while still retaining the stock wipe/wash stalk to actuate the washer?

I know that I could buy a generic electric windshield washer and install a 
separate washer button on the dash or something (and I will if that is the 
*only* choice) but I'd love to keep my excellent original bus looking original.

Is there some way of fitting a microswitch in place of the original pneumatic 
coupling on the stalk, or perhaps swapping in a part from a newer VW?  I 
remember that on 914s you could upgrade to an electric washer by swapping in a 924 
wiper/washer stalk.  Is there anythung similar for the bus?  Anybody done 
this before?  All past references I could find just mentioned the separate button 
on the dash, nothing using the OE wipe/wash stalk.

Any info greatly appreciated!
