Subject: another really fantastic tire question you can't delete

i wondered if it were shocking and appalling to put 195's in the back, with
185's in the front until i realized i'da hafta carry two spare tires. but
has anyone tried this or know what might happen??

&gt;depends is it a plug/patch from the inside?? or just an external
&gt;plug.  plugs do not work on steel belted tires at all and should not be
&gt;used at speed, or on radials
&gt;
&gt;YMMV
&gt;Bob
