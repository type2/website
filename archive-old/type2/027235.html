OK, you are suppose to check the compression when the engine is (hot - 
warmish).

You are NOT suppose to remove the spark plugs when the engine is (hot - 
warmish).

Heck, I am STILL trying to get two teaspoons of oil into #3!!  How do you do 
this without spilling some all over the place.  I can use a squirt (oil) can 
with a flexible neck, but how do I know I got the 2 teaspoons in, or did I 
squirt oil all over the place??

Man, these things really bother me - like, half way through my lunch hour.
