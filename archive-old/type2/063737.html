Subject: Stats change, gotta bus

I'm now the proud owner of a rather rough '73 Westy.  All my other buses 
have had upright engines, so this will be a learning experience.  The 
engine has a prefix of EC.  Looking this up in the Idiot Guide it seems 
to have come from a '74 411.  But, the engine has been refitted with a 
lone weber on an intake manifold.  Anyone else have this set up?  Does it 
work OK or should I start looking for a used injection system?  My main 
priorities for an engine are reliability and longevity.  Thanks.
