Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Empi vs. Bugpack merged aftermarket exhaust for 77
   Westy

&gt; Actually it's a PIA for the Vanagons. Not enough clearance 
&gt; for the heater tubes. Some guys bash them in to make the 
&gt; muffler fit, but a better idea is to sandwich a bunch of 
&gt; gaskets between the muffler and heater boxes. For my van I 
&gt; cut off the mounting flanges from the old stock exhaust and 
&gt; used them as spacers. Fit like a charm.


That depends on the muffler. In Europe two versions of the muffler were
offered, one that had a few carefully placed &quot;dimples&quot; that allowed it to
clear the heater tubes, and one that didn't and therefore only fit a Bus. In
the U.S., you can get the Dansk version with the dimples but not the Ernst
version.
