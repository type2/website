Subject: Re: [T2] can it be done?

You're right!  I wasn't thinking straight on the cam.  For my students'
sake I had better grade this stack of AP Physics tests while my brain's
still jello!  :)

&gt; Actually, if the cam is 180 degrees out, by turning the crank 360 degrees,
&gt; the cam will be in the right place.
&gt; I would agree that the problem is the distributor drive.
&gt; I would agree completely with your remedy.
&gt; the engine would NEVER have run if the cam and crank were off by more than a
&gt; tooth and then, it would not run well.

&gt; &gt; On to your problem.  I suppose that it would be theoretially possible to
&gt; &gt; have the cam 180 degrees out, but it is much more likely that the
&gt; &gt; distributor drive is 180 degrees out.
