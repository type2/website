Amy,

There are a few things that affect the cold running of your bus that I can
think of offhand.
1. Choke - make sure it is adjusted properly (see type2_dot_com library &amp;
archives).  This is probably not your problem because your engine starts up
and runs OK at first.
2. Thermostat &amp; flaps - should be present and correct.  Make sure the little
lever the cable attaches to is in the down position when cold.
3. Air intake pre-heat - I had my hoses hooked up back to front until a
month ago (DOH!) - you would not *believe* what a difference it makes if
this system is working properly.  My engine used to run like crap when cold
and cut out at every set of lights, now runs fine but only if I bypass the
thermo valve and connect the vacuum directly to the flapper diaphragm (I
think the valve may be stuck closed).  Anyway, you can check if this stuff
works by sucking on the vacuum hose that comes from the pipework under the
air cleaner and seeing if the flap moves up and down (near where your
corrugated intake hose attaches).  You may have to remove the air cleaner to
see this.

I hope this makes sense.  Other listees with actual english skills would be
able to explain it better.  You will also find that your engine warms up
quicker if you start driving straight away (gently) rather than letting it
idle.

&gt; started my bus and it was running fine for about 5 min. while 
&gt; I let it warm 
&gt; up, and then when I got in it just died.  It started back up, 
&gt; but if I didn't 
&gt; give it a lot of gas on my way to school it would die.  Is it
