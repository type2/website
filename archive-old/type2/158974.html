Subject: Cotbed to Upper bed conversion

Why replace cot with canvas?  This foamboard bed was stock in European
Campers; my 71 had this, and it lifted with the roof and was outof the 
way when clipped to the roof.

Pop Top Cot to Bed Conversion

by Michael Benthin

   (Now in 
Archives)------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Editor's Note: Mike describes the procedure for installing the Westfalia
foamboard bed (found in some European models in place of the cot typically
found on US imported '68-'73 poptop campers). The advantage is a larger,
more comfortable bed, without the need to make the more extensive
modifications for the alternative solution: to install a '74-'79 style
poptop.]

There were queries on the detail of the Europeam option foamboard bed to
replace the cot on top. Details with drawings follow: (printout is easier)

The stock 57&quot;x38.25&quot; board had hinges at the front corners made of two
pieces of rightangle steel on the board and two corresponding pieces
screwed to the roof under the poptop front. These lifted the board high
enough at the sides to allow for curvature of roof in front. I did find
these; they are galvanized &quot;L's&quot; bent at 77 degrees , and the hole for
hinge bolt pivot is 1&quot;7/8&quot; off the roof. If flattened it's shape is: (side
of bed view)

                       ---+-----+--------------------------

It also had at least a pair of large rubber &quot;feet&quot; about 1&quot; in diameter x
1.5&quot; high at sides of board that rested on opening sides and made+ the
board level. It also had 2 &quot;forks&quot; (looks like end of tie rod fork) that
were screwed to edges just where the poptop roof grabbers could slip into
them to hold board up out of way when standing in bus. I don't have all the
hardware anymore, but looked at the board, and the holes for the grabbers
have nuts &quot;glued&quot; inside (probably countersunk under the foam); same for
hinge area. I'm sure that in use, one had to lift the top first (so you
need the 10&quot; or so gap at rear to push up top and climb up there), then
push up and latch the board.

If I were designing this,

   1. I'd measure the distance from front (where it'll fit with poptop down)
      to where board will end - for skinny people, can be less gap, for
      larger people, bigger gap! Also measure maximum width (with top down)
      that a board will fit overlapping opening.

   2. Cut the board out of at least 9/16&quot; plywood (the good stuff, not
      sheathing; good stuff has no voids). I'd test for board strength by
      laying edges on two studs and lying on to see how much it gives. 

      Round sharp corners. Test on roof opening to see if rear opening 
is                      big enough to let you open roof &amp; climb up onto 
board. I suspect you can
      use a thinner 3/8&quot; -1/2&quot; board if you beef up the edge at rear with
      thicker piece glued underneath or steel angle iron.

   3. Make hinges from sheet steel at least 1/16&quot; thick- bolts thru whole
      board would be stronger; or possibly you could buy the 1&quot; wide flat
      bar stock long enough to just bend down ends for hinge pivot and drill
      a bunch of screw holes to fasten it to board. You can use aluminum
      1/8&quot; thick for this (4-6 ft long)' long...Use just a few screws now,
      since you will screw this over fabric later. Would let you use thinner
      board (1/2&quot;) also. I'd make the entire hinge with pivot holes and
      hinge bottoms already bolted (with &quot;binding&quot; nut) to board, then put
      board in opening LIFTED up so you can see hinge bottoms, and mark
      holes for hinge bottoms on roof- (or measure very well &amp; transfer to
      roof;remember it's curved!) -get rid of board, drill the holes for
      either sheet metal screws or bolts thru roof (must pull canopy board
      for this). I'd use cap head bolts/screws so if it's a tight space
      (even with board lifted), you can use a flat wrench to fasten it down
      or hold while applying nut below. Mock up the board (don't tighten
      hinge bottoms yet).

   4. Locate grabber locations and fabricate something for them to lock
      board up- Me, I'd use a eyehook bolted to center of board and sash
      cord left tied across poptop supports at top- just hook over the eye-
      especially since lots of tops have the grabbers rotted out!

   5. Also check for leveling supports near end of board; add some to middle
      if it sags. Doesn't have to be rubber, could be plywood blocks screwed
      to bottom?

   6. Check for clearance to roof and get some foam (1.5 -2&quot; thick&quot;?). Get
      some upholstery fabric at the same time allowing at least 5&quot; extra
      over boa rd dimensions. (check store for endies, can be any HEAVY
      fabric). If you don't have it, get staple gun or lots of uphostery
      tacks. Take board down (you left it loose, right?)- and lay down
      upholstery, then foam, then board. You know the routine, bend up sides
      of fabric over board, tucking in an underlap, staple/nail all along
      one edge. Do opposite side. Do front, rear. TAPE Mystic tape over all
      the staples. If you used the flat bar stock with bend ends for board
      hinge, it's easy to put it back over fabric now with lots of screws.
      It must be within 1&quot; of edge, or board will hit roof when lifted! Add
      the spacer blocks and grabber holds if any.

   7. Muscle all this up there and fasten the hinges to roof. Voila, a
      bigger bed! For long people, the extra board I put in had cutouts for
      the roof arms and dropped across opening once you were up there. Would
      be easiest to add extra foam for this with fabric stapled to thin
      (1/4&quot;) board which is then GLUED to the across board with some kind of
      rope loops at sides to help pull out the board. Make sure the foam
      really butts agains foam on bed, since this is your head end; pillow
      will lay on this anyway.
