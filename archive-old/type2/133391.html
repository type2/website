&gt; I'm in a co-op that owns a house on an island only accessible to vehicles
&gt; via WWII landing craft -- I kid you not.  We have a 77 automatic bus out
&gt; there we use to get from the passenger ferry dock to the house and,
&gt; naturally, it's rusting to pieces in the sea air.  So we're looking for a
&gt; donor body that we'll seal up as best we can, take it out there, and
&gt; cannibalize the rusty-but-running 77.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not up to speed on late bays, but I'm assuming our engine will fit
&gt; just about any Type IV-engined bay body?
&gt;
&gt; Regarding our auto tranny, if the donor is a manual, can the automatic
&gt; components (tranny, linkage, etc.) just be bolted right into a manual body

no unfortunately the auto tranny has different hardware and the bus is
actually built as an automatic

&gt; or will we need to do some mods?

lots and lots of mods, anything is doable but.

&gt;  If the donor has a working manual tranny
&gt; we may not bother -- the island's dirt roads don't really allow you to get
&gt; above 3rd gear, so a tranny with bad 4th wouldn't be an issue.

might be in a position to take the auto tranny off your hands,

Bob
