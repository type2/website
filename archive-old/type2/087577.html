Subject: Everybus 2002 update

Hi,

EveryBus 2002 April 19-21, 2002. Complete details at http://www.everybus_dot_com

Update highlights.

Registration
There have been lots of questions about the registration process. 
Please visit this page if you are going. It has some very important 
info! Judy Neville has accepted the position of lead registrar and 
will be assisted several EB old-timers. The registration page has 
been redone and now sports a hamfisted .gif of the camping area.

Carabus List
The list continues to grow. There are now three buses coming from 
California! I have added the option of having a picture of your bus 
included if you are part of the carabus list. If you are coming to 
the event and want to join or lead a carabus please send me your an 
email and include a pic of your bus is you have one in .jpg format.

Kid's activities.
A group of young women(Tootsie Jablonski, Vicki Rivers and Cassidy 
Yust) who are 3 time veterans of EB have grouped together to handle 
the kid's activities. You can find contact info on the web-site and 
soon we should have some outline of the activities.

Many thanks
