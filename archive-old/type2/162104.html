Subject: New VW Bay Window DST Rules

Greetings All -

It's late, and I might not get home, from tomorrow until Monday,  
seeing as the new Daylight Saving Time (DST) rules affect my other  
life (called &quot;work&quot;), so I'm appealing to the Admins to allow me this  
- I'll try to make it T2 oriented...

So.... in my '69 Westy, I have a clock that it searches for signals  
from Boulder, Colorado's DIST-F1's Cecium-powered Atomic Clock for  
the time-of-day. Not such a big deal, eh? ... remember, I have this  
clock IN MY BUS.

If your BUS, like mine, has any &quot;Scheduled Tasks&quot; (or, if your BUS  
uses Unix, like mine, CRONTABS), that are scheduled for 2:01:01AM  
until 03:00:00AM, THEY WILL NOT EXECUTE on March 11th. Likewise, come  
November... things will execute TWICE if scheduled from 01:00:01 to  
02:00:00.

Obviously, Germany never anticipated DST in the 1040's... so be  
prepared!

Mike
