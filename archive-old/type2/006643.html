As you know, these steering boxes have a &quot;tight spot&quot; engineered into them
at the centered position.  If the box isn't adjusted correctly the &quot;tight
spot&quot; will bind, or in some cases actually cause a &quot;dimple&quot; or low spot in
one of the gears.  When this happens, no amount of adjusting will solve the
problem and the steering gear is basically scrap.

Over the years I've found the majority of steering gear boxes on early bay
buses are not properly adjusted, and at least half have a dimple that
renders them beyond repair.

FWIW.....
