It is always the same place for me as well. I hit the turn about 150 yards from my parking space at work. Motor and oil are cold. It seems to come on as I am coming out of hard right turn. I think the oil is thick and slow to slosh back to the pick up tube. The first time it happened I shut the motor down and coasted into the breakdown lane of the interstate overpass. I was happily surprised to check my oil level and find that it was at the low mark. For some odd reason I always carry a few extra quarts of oil so I topped it off and went about my may:)

Happy Motoring

&gt; I have to agree. There is a certain light near the studio where I often
have to make a quick stop while the engine is still cool and I can get the
oil light on occasionally.
