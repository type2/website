Howdy all, I just thought I would share what a great time we had this weekend,
in hopes of enticing even more of you to show up next time!
 We had 8 busses this time, including a crew cab, 2 splits, and 5 late model
Westfalias.
 We began arriving in the early evening, and set up in an area with a couple
larger sites, to accomodate everyone. As we were standing around setting up
camp, the ranger came up and asked if he could look in the busses. We were
rather upset for a few seconds, until he stated that he was a VW person
himself, having owned several Beetles. Well, that made things a LOT easier for
the night, as he then let us stretch the occupational limits of the campsites.
 We had a gerat time swimming in the lake, and meeting some new folks, and then
shared a SUPER community meal of Stefan &quot;MR. Camping&quot;'s burritos.
 Anyway, We had an excellent time, and are planning more east-coast stuff in
the near and distant future...
Hope to see even more of you next time!
