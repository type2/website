Subject: Anyone wanting a Holley dual choke?? Trade carbs???

I would like to take my 1.8L back to factory carburetion before I put it on 
the road. It has a progressive dual choke Holley now.

I would like to trade the Holley, aircleaner, manifolds, for a VW dual setup, 
including the linkage and air cleaner boxes with heat and air pipes.

Anyone looking for a Holley?
