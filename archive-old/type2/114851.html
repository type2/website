Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Towing a Campermobile with a Vanagon?

&gt;Sorry Rick I can't agree with you.  &quot;All of the safety measures&quot; would
include having a capable tow  
&gt;vehicle.  I think you would agree that a drum-braked 3000lb splittie with a
50hp engine does not 
&gt;qualify.

I would have to agree with this as well. I have often pondered over what
possess people to tow heavy objects with a 50hp motor on a 3000 pound
vehicle...Personally, I would never consider that as option and I would
barely consider it using my 2003 Mazda B3000...which has a V6 in it and
weighs around 3500 pounds.
