Hi volks,
               You may recall that I posted a few weeks back about the &quot;exhausty&quot; noise I have been getting. I was concerned that I had a cracked head or something similar.

 Well, a couple of Saturdays later I have pulled my exhaust system and replaced the heat exchangers and the tailpipe (silencer was good). and now my bus is smooth and quiet again.

 The HX to head nuts came off OK- they simply unscrewed without any problems (one stud came out of the head), however I had to cut off all six of the HX to silencer nuts- I used a nut splitter on them. The tailpipe bolts just sheared off- my new tailpipe is now held on with one bolt and two self tapping screws(!).

 I replaced the head nuts with VW ones- they are a self locking nut with an insert in the thread: Kinda pricey. I was told that the studs take an M8 nut but that doesn't seem to be the original VW spec.
 I wonder if the reason that I found them so easy to remove is the fact that they were the original spec nuts? I would guess that if the HXs had been attached with conventional nuts they would have been a real pig to shift.

 The new exchangers were Danske ones- I was told that these are OEM quality but that may not be true. After I'd bolted them to the heads I found that the spacing between the silencer outlets was bigger than it ought to be and that the LHS exchanger was sitting higher up than the previous one had been. It took a bit of fiddling with drills and files to get the whole thing properly fixed.
 The exhaust is now OK, no more chugging on acceleration or popping on overrun but I havn't completed the renovation of the heat system- I'm intending to replace the elbows (HXs to control flaps, UKL45 from Just Kampers, UKL35(+VAT) from VW) and some of the ducting, plus the control cable I got from Karl (Thanks, Karl!) and the kick panels.

 Thanks for the input from those that emailed on the likely causes of the original problem. When I pulled the HXs the copper sealing washers were very thin, one was split and they had clearly been leaking.

Cheers,
              W.
