Subject: Re: [T2] replacing Solex 30 PICT with 34 PICT

&gt;I suspect that the Solex 30 PICT-3 carb on my single port 1600 needs to be
&gt;rebuilt.  I have a spare rebuilt 34 PICT-3 but I don't know if the two are
&gt;interchangable without any significant modifications.  Can anyone clear
&gt;this up for me?  Thanks in advance.

One important difference is that the Solex 30 has a 30mm throat and the 
Solex 34 has a 34mm throat. More power (1/5 HP at least!).

&lt;grin&gt;

I've used both and prefer the bigger carb.
