Subject: need help with backfire

i checked in the library and other tech pages but ddin't find much.  i have
a 75 camper with a 2.0 liter type 4 engine and it backfires when i let offf
the gas, it can vary from a small puff to a shotgun type bang.  i just put
on a new exhaust because my old one was swiss cheese before it fell off. so
does it sound like a fuel mixture problem or is gas just not burning and
getting caught inthe exhaust??? any help is greatly appreciated. thanks for
your time.
