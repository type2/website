&gt; I'm a Volksie newbie here, just bought a '79 Westy about a month ago and

&gt; paranoid about heat.  Just finished installing oil temp/pressure gauges
&gt; today in order to monitor exactly what's going on.  Now I'm hooked on the
&gt; notion that an external oil cooler would be some good insurance for the
&gt; long road trips ahead.  But which cooler?

you did the right thing in putting in the guages, the typeIV engines are
pretty tough and the overheating problem is not a major factor in the
stock setup.  my suggestion is to really make sure your engine compartment
is sealed tight, especially the areas over the exhaust pipes and muffler.  
 
keep an eye on the guages and unless one gets well over 250 and stays
there on a hot day you are probably ok.  .  slowing down to about 55 seems
to keep the engines running cooler but that is just my experience.
remember the outside air has a lot to do with how hot the engine is
running.  (very general and loose rule of thumb for mine is about 170F +
the outside temp, at continous high speed running.)   as the thermostat is
supposed to keep the engine warmer in cooler temps do not expect the
engine to be much below 185 or so in winter.  YMMV

putting an oil cooler on the type IV engines is a royal PITA!  (IMO)

in very hot weather I have been known to drive with my engine comp door
open, seems to help that I draw fresh air in directly, don't forget to
shut it when you stop.
