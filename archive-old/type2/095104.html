Subject: 'New' engines

&gt;counterman, a trade mag for shops, even had an article on his shop last 
&gt;month.

Painter's shop is an awesome VW surgery center, yeah. A big warehouse filled 
with tooling rooms, building rooms, big racks of engines and engines-to-be, 
a few bays and a lobby sponsored by Bugpack. When the '69 I bought with an 
owner rebuild (my first VW) threw a rod in the first 1,000 miles, I cursed 
my life and then I waited six months and then I called Painter's to ask 
about a new Mexican longblock - I had heard he could get them and I no 
longer trusted any old rebuild. He sold me on his shop's &quot;new engine&quot; build, 
which was new Brazilian everything except rods and crank (&quot;I won't use 
Brazilian cranks&quot; he said) plus a few things I wanted like an oil filter and 
1641 P/Cs. It was an expensive engine: $1500 for the longblock and I still 
had to freight it over the mountains. That was 18 months ago; I'm at 23,000 
engine miles - it's in another bus now - and still running strong. The 
aftermarket oil pump cover they slapped on leaked from first start-up, a 
poor finishing touch, but I drove it to Denver and the tech fixed it for 
free - they had put the wrong bolts in.
