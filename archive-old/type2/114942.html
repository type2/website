Subject: Re: [T2] 75 bus westfalia

Hi James,

You have just driven straight and true, right up my alley of expertise. 
Welcome to the westification zone.

A '75 pop-top will fit your bus quite readily. I installed a '74 
pop-top onto a '79 bus back in the winter of 00/01. It was an excellent 
winter project. Damn shame you're a province-and-a-half from here....

The westification process can be completed in something between 20 and 
100 hours, depending on the level of finish you are looking for and the 
amount of autobody/metalworking proficiency you possess. There is only 
one structural member in the bus roof that needs to be removed and it 
gets replaced by the corresponding element in the donor roof. A 20-hour 
job would be glued rather than welded, and the level of finish would 
be... rudimentary. I contemplated using sheet-metal screws and RTV 
sealant for my project at one point but the donor bus turned out to be 
too good to treat so rough. YMMV.  A 100-hour job should be virtually 
indistinguishable from a factory westy. Plan on getting really familiar 
with your angle-grinder.

For that $$$ I would insist on a leakdown test first. Get the vacuum 
read, too. That will help make sure you're not buying an engine with 
problems. If everything checks out OK, you've got a bargain. If not, 
you've got evidence to haggle with. An engine-less westy can often be 
had for a few hundred dollars.

&gt; Hi there
&gt;
&gt; I have a 78' bus and am looking for a project this winter.
&gt; I have come across a 75 westfalia with a 2l fi motor. (Obviously not 
&gt; the original)
&gt; I haven't had a chance to take a good look at it but it's supposed to 
&gt; be in decent
&gt; mechanical condition but lots of rust.
&gt;
&gt; What's the chances the 75' poptop would fit my 78'?
&gt; Since mine is set up with a type 4 motor, the 2l might be ready to drop
&gt; in if it's in decent shape.  (mine is a 1700 and I could really enjoy 
&gt; more power).
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts on the idea.  I could probably get it for 1500$ 
&gt; Canadian.. around
&gt; 1100$ish US.
