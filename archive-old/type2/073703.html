Subject: Riviera sliding window

My 72 Rivi is missing the passenger side sliding window.  I went to the
glass shop and they told me it's NLA und would have to be reproduced in
plastic unless I could track down the manufacturer.

So, first, does anyone happen to have one, or even the little clasp?  And
second, does anyone know who manufactured the window frames?  I've examined
mine and find no maker's mark.  Maybe I'll have to scrounge a set of
jalousies. :(

Regards,
Grant
