&gt; I've been thinking about trying the synthetic route. 
&gt; Since you've done it I have a few concerns maybe you
&gt; could help with
&gt; 
&gt; How cold does it get where you are?  Do you think the
&gt; 5W50 work in the real/real cold?

I am a ski instructor, some mornings it's well below 0, now I do have a
dipstick oil heater, but I'm not real good at using it, so about half the
time the temp is ambient
 &gt; 
&gt; I have pesky leaks on the valve covers that wont go
&gt; away.  DO I need to make it leak proof prior to
&gt; changing?

don't NEED to make it leak proof but synthetic is $$$$$ so it sure helps
