Jeff:

Coincidentally, I received my POR15 order yesterday just after I sent out this e-mail, and according to the enclosed POR15 literature, you don't have to paint over POR15.  It is UV sensitive, but UV only causes a cosmetic change, such as changing color.  However, UV doesn't affect the rust preventive quality of POR15.  Obviously, you wouldn't want to use POR15 as your top coat, but you could use the clear coat product they have, which is not UV sensitive.  They also have a gloss white that isn't UV sensitive, which I'm thinking about using for the roof of my bus.

&gt; That saves a step, because with corroseal you'd still have to paint over
&gt;it.

&gt;&gt; Not so, With POR 15 you must paint as well, unless it is not exposed to
&gt;UV light. I've used both products, and IMHO they both work equally well,
