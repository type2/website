Subject: RE: [T2] I passed!!!

well I had put it off as long as I could, finally fired up the beast and
took it to the emissions station for testing, really didn't expect to do
well but a failure bought 90 days to get it fixed... the lady testing the
bus seemed quite pleased for a change of pace..

well the computer must have been satisified as it spit out the papers that
lets me drive her for two more years.  it was close in one place though
state allows 430ppm of HC max, I scored a 428ppm  but the bottom line is
that it passed!!! so I'm valid thru 25 Feb 2009!!

Bob
