Subject: Tie Rod seperator

Hello all, I'm thinking that before I send my &quot;old&quot; bus off to the boneyard I'd 
like to pull off the tie rods, which have less than 1,000 miles on them and 
exchange them for the ones on my &quot;new&quot; bus, which are of unknown age. In the 
Bentley section on front end, it shows a tie rod seperator being used. Is this 
a special vw specific tool, or can I rent one from my local autozone?
TIA--
