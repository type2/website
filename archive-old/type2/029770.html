&gt; Turn signals come on but do not flash.

OK, fixed the problem.  Before I got a chance to fix the flasher, the
headlights got stuck on high beam (luckily close to home)

The problem seems to be that water from the recent heavy rains managed to
get into the flasher and dimmer relay.  They plug into the bottom of the
fuse block, apparently designed by some idiot who didn't realize that
relays are vented on the &quot;prongs&quot; end for a reason!

Next problem:  The 4-pin 411-941-583C relay is no longer available (at
least locally)  Web searches revealed only one source, a Porsche supplier.

Luckily, I have a fairly savvy parts guy and he pulled out a 111-941-583
5-pin relay to compare.  The extra pin (#30) is supposed to be attached to
a hot wire to energize the relay coil.  In the old relay the coil  was
attached internally to pin 56 which
is the voltage source supplied from the headlight switch.

Apparently, the idea of the 5-pin relay was to allow the beams to be
switched with the
headlights off by supplying the relay with power from the ignition
circuit.

I soldered a jumper between the #30 and #56 pins and plugged the relay in.
There was a hole in the fuse block to accept the #30 pin, but no connector
inside the hole.  The modified relay worked perfectly.

The 3-prong flasher was a direct replacement.  No problems there.

I drilled a 1/32 hole in the bottom of each &quot;can&quot; to allow any water the
finds its way in in the future to exit.  I also fashioned a plastic cover
to deflect water from the fuse block.  Next job is to find the windshield
leak.

I was told that the fuse block was difficult to free in order to get at
the relays, but it turned out that it was fairly easy.  I didn't have to
remove any screws at all.  There is a spring clip in the center below the
fuses.  I pulled the clip away from the block and the whole thing slid
upward out of its bracket.  You have to lift it quite a ways to clear the
relays so that you can get at them.  This is definitely a time when you
want to disconnect the battery ground strap!  Getting it back in was a bit
tricky, as there are three plastic tabs that have to slide onto the
bracket on each side.  Once they are in the right place the block just
pushes down until it clicks into place.

While I was there, I also cleaned and retensioned the spring terminals in
the fuse block and replaced a few corroded fuses.  This was the first time
I had done this and found a few 15a fuses in place of the correct 8A
fuses.

The left turn signal now flashed at double speed.  I cleaned the taillight
socket and that fixed that problem.  The bulb wasn't grounding properly.

Thus ends my electrical odyssey.  I still wish I had switch diagrams for
the emergency flasher switch, the ignition switch, and the light switch.
That would have made troubleshooting much easier.
