Subject: Re: [T2] STOP ! ! (please)


&gt; &gt; Now, 167 ft /  23 ft/sec is just over 7 seconds.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just how loudly could I scream for 7 seconds of panic stop, all (hopefully)
&gt; &gt; four wheel pealing rubber, and the object of my attention drawing closer to
&gt; &gt; my front wheels with every second??
&gt;
&gt;A locked up wheel will not stop a vehicle, i.e. four wheel pealing rubber. And
&gt;you have no steering control. That is the main reason for Anti-lock brakes. To
&gt;keep you from locking up the wheels and losing steering control. One of the
&gt;benefits was shorter stopping distances.

An article I read explained that a sliding tire on a smooth surface 
(pavement) actually slides further because the bits and pieces of the tire 
that rub off ball up and cause the tires to slide on little rubber balls - 
- just like an eraser on paper. Slide you finger over a pile of eraser 
debris and see if the friction of your finger against paper doesn't go down.

Sliding is better though at slow speeds on dirt and gravel b/c of the small 
pile of debris that builds up in front of the tire and helps stop the vehicle.

FWIW...
