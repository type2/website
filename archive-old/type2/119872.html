Generally, fluorescent lights are well encased in plastic housings, and
they don't run nearly as hot as incandescent bulbs.  Gasoline vapor
doesn't get next to ignition temperature parts.

The temperature of an incandescent bulb probably won't ignite gasoline
either, but when the bulb shatters from the sudden temperature change the
filament will burn out and spark which will set the gas afire!

A good thing to put in your toolbox is a couple of large Cyalume light
sticks.  Very handy trouble lights for those night-time repairs on lonely
highways.
