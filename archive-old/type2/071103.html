To all who replied, thank you.

The 1.8 has a bad upper, the 2.0 a bad lower.

I understand how the extra 100cc or so was obtained, and that the engines can 
be &quot;married&quot;. I just can't figure if the cylinders need spaced upwards 
(assuming the pin-to-crown height is reduced on the 2.0) or cut (which I 
won't do). If it is a matter of inserting a 5mm spacer at the bottom of each 
cylinder, that is easy enough and would give my son a drivable bus while I 
rebuilt the 2.0 properly.
