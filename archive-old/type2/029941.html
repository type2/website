&gt; So Wallymart has their oil on the shelf at 92 cents Canadian which is about
&gt; 60 cents US. That is an incredible price. It is 10-30 and appears to be
&gt; similarly bottled as the Esso they sell.

Many products come in similar bottles, since the bottle manufacturers sell
to anyone who wants to buy.

 Comments on this? At 3000km
&gt; oilchanges, would this oil suffice?

Probably, since it's a good bet that WM bought the oil from one of the
majors and it's coded with the correct rating.  However, if WM sold a bad
batch of oil the bad press wouldn't make much of a dent in their business.
If Texaco (for example) did the same and it fried a few engines it
definitely would.  Bought any Firestone tires lately?  

My rule of thumb is
that I buy the least expensive brand of oil that has an oil company's name
on the bottle.  that way I can be pretty sure that it is what the specs
say it is.  I change every 2000 miles.  For the transmission, I use
Redline MT-90, since it doesn't get contaminated or changed as often.  If
I had a filter on the engine I might consider synthetic for the engine as
well.

 I don't know about it's additive package
&gt; and of course Wallymart people know nothing. Wonder who is making it for
&gt; them, it carries all the approval ratings, but IS marked energy conserving
&gt; which I've been told is not a good thing for air cooleds.

AFAIK, &quot;energy conserving&quot; simply means that it has low viscosity, which
is fine in aircooleds if the weather is cool.
