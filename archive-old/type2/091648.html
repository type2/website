Subject: RE: [T2] Dual batteries?

I've just converted to dual batteries. It wasn't that hard. I purchase a $30
dual battery isolator from Autozone and followed the directions on the box
for hooking it up. The trickiest thing was moving the accessories wire that
attaches to the starter to the auxiliary battery terminal on the battery
isolator. 

If I have it wired correctly, my starter battery does only that, start the
engine. Everything else is run off of a deep cycle marine battery that I
bought at Wal-Mart. The only possible problem that I may have is if I run
the marine battery completely dead. If I do that it probably won't have
enough juice to engage the starter solenoid to start the engine. In that
case I'll have to jumper the starter and auxiliary battery terminals on the
isolator. No big deal.
