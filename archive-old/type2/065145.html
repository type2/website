&gt; Hey all-
&gt; 
&gt; A while back there was a lot of discussion on what was the best weight
&gt; and kind of oil to use...Muir talks about ruining an engine by switching
&gt; from mutiple weight to detergent oil (I think)...does that mean I
&gt; shouldn't switch from say 10w30 to straight 30 weight?
&gt;   I think he men't don't change from non-detergent to detergentas this would release all carbon,dirt and crap from the nooks and 
crannies of the case and cooler and would plug oil passages and cause 
havoc!     Peace Phil
&gt; Comments appreciated.  Thanks!!
