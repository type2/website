&gt;         I was able to look at the generator and regulator on Ras Bulli

&gt; activity ;)  I could only perform the voltage test as my multimetre
&gt; can't cope with the number of amps that &quot;should&quot; be involved here.
&gt; The preliminary results do not warm I with encouragement...with the
&gt; engine running and everything in it's place, there is a small voltage
&gt; at the generator terminals...save it appears to be coming back through
&gt; the regulator to the generator... I stop the engine, disconnect the
&gt; ground strap, then the generator, start the engine up and try
&gt; measuring the voltage off the generator without the regulator...nada
&gt; :(
&gt; 
&gt; I pulled the brushes and they look fine, and the commuter doesn't look
&gt; burnt anywhere.  I checked the terminal wiring and cleaned the
&gt; commuter and brushes.
&gt; I then pulled the regulator and cleaned all the contacts and traced
&gt; all the wires from end-to-end...everything is connected properly.
&gt; 

Did you try replacing the brushes? If they are worn down too far, they short-out against 
the brush holder.
