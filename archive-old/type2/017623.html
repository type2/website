Try the Bus Depot at  (215) 234-VWVW  or

http://www.busdepot_dot_com/

    They will have the parts you need and get them out quick.  Their
prices are good too.

My FLAPs can't seem to get bus tranny mounts for me through any of there
suppliers ('72 bus)...and I can't find them listed anywhere.

I don't have the part for the front one (technically a transmission
hanger, I think), but the back ones (2) are 211 599 431. I need all
three if I can get them, but I'll settle for the back. One of my rear
mounts is broken, so I NEED it bad.

If anyone knows where to get these, I'd appreciate the info.

Thanks! Joe
