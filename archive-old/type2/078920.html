Subject: Re: [T2] Is airconditioning a good idea in stock 71 Westy?


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'd seriously consider a modern conversion system.  I'm sure new compressors
&gt;run MUCH more efficiently than those built 30 years ago.  If you are still
&gt;running a 1600 bug motor in you 3000lb+ bus you will want all the effieciency
&gt;you can get!
&gt;
&gt;If AC is very important, it also may be time to consider a type 4 conversion
&gt;at your next rebuild.  With almost 20 more stock hp, its much more capable of
&gt;powering AC without cooking itself.


Or a Corvair (Trans-Vair) conversion.

Choose your flavor: 95 HP, 110 HP, 140 HP, or 180 HP turbo.

I recommend 95 HP (cools best) or 110 HP (if you've just gotta have more HP.)

The difference is in the compression ratio.

Higher compression ratio = higher HP = higher heat = more chance you'll 
cook your engine on a hill.

Just pokin' at 'cha.
