Subject: REAR discs for a 1971 ???
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Does anyone know of a kit... or a set-up (please give year of equip. used) for
installing rear disc brakes on a 1971 Westy. As you know I have the front
discs but need more stopping power for my new (fat) motor.

Thanks in Advance
