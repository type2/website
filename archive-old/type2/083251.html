Subject: timing question


I have a '74 bus that I acquired earlier this year, and went to adjust
the valves and check the timing this weekend (finally.) It has a 1.8l
engine, manual tranny, stock carbs, and stock (I think -- at least it has
vacuum advance) dizzy.

The bus has been running pretty well, but it would lose a bit of power after
driving on the freeway for about 20 minutes, and would idle roughly afterwards
until it cooled off a bit. I found that #3 exhaust and both #4 valves were
tight, and that probably explains the rough-after-warmup stuff.

I figured that was fine, and went to set the timing. Muir swears that
all air-cooled VWs should be statically timed, yet his timing chart
shows that my engine should be timed at 10 degrees ATDC at 900rpm. OK, so
I get out my trusty timing light that I've been using for 20 years or so.
Except the timing light is dead. The bus was still rough idling, and
a couple people who have listened to it mentioned that timing was likely
an issue. So I started reading up on timing in the library, and one article
said that setting the timing to fastest rpm at idle is usually pretty darn
close, but perhaps a bit too advanced. So I set it that way and drove around
a bit.  It wasn't pinging, but since I had advanced it a good 12-15 degrees
I thought I should probably back it off a wee bit, which I did (3 degrees.)

The bus is running great now, has more power than it's ever had since
I've owned it, but I'm a little concerned that it may be advanced a bit
too much. I'll go deal with the timing light issue ASAP, but I may have
a 250 mile drive to make (all freeway) before I can get to that. Is
this too scary to do? I can back it off a bit more, but I'm rather enjoying
the power I suddenly have. :)

BTW, there were *NO* timing marks on the front of the pulley, and the
timing gauge on the case was just bare metal (I pulled one off an
extra engine and made the proper marks in the proper places), so I'm sure
that the PO would have had a very difficult time setting timing.
