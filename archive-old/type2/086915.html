&gt; &gt; DOT3 is specified.  You can use DOT4 also as it is compatible.  DO NOT USE
&gt; &gt; DOT5!!

&gt; You can also use DOT 5.1--AKA &quot;synthetic brake fluid.&quot; Available as Castrol
&gt; GT/LMA, Valvoline Synpower, etc., etc., etc. Specifically made to be
&gt; compatible with DOT 3 and 4.
