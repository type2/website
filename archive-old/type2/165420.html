&gt; Hi All:
&gt; I am in the process of changing my registration/title back to California
&gt; from Pennsylvania.  The problem I ran into was that DMV wanted to identify
&gt; the VIN No in two locations.  The one at the windshield was readable since
&gt; it is pressed into metal  The decal label don the drivers side door entrance
&gt; is damaged so you cannot read all the numbers.

You will also find the number in the engine bay.  On early bays the number
is stamped into the sheet metal below and behind the air cleaner platform.

I've never had DMV do more than peer through the windshield at the number
there.  Looking for two numbers must either be new or a local office &quot;make
more hassle&quot; program.
