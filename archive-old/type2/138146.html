Subject: Re: [T2] Generator Testing Help

hello eric     do you have a volt meter , how about the idiot book ???    If 
you have a volt meter you can tesst the gen and voltage regulator.Take the two 
wires off the generator hook the postive lead of the meter to D+ and the 
negative lead to the Df terminal on the gen. Start the engine and use a jumper 
wire from the Df to the body of the gen. dont hold it on too long so be quick  
rev the engine the volt meter should jump up to about 36 volts. if not then gen 
is bad if it does then hook the two wires back up to the gen. go to the 
regulator unhook the big red wire at terminal B+   if you have two wires here unhook 
both and hook them together put the postive lead of the meter on the B+ 
terminal and the neg lead on the ground side of the battery start the engine and 
rev the volt meter should read about 13 volts if not then the reg is bad   later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing
