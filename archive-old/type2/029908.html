&gt; I have had a set of these on my '71 for several years now and Ron's right.
&gt; No rust.  However the plastic beading between the glass and the metal is
&gt; cracking from the UV exposure.  I;ll have to find a replacement bead
&gt; material or simply silicone the glass into place.


Eh. No!  Dont use silicon on mirror!  it will, quite nicely, remove the
mirror backing from the glass...

Hit up a glass shop for a few squirts of something mirror safe.  the
urethane based stuff should work fine.  (if fact, liquid nails would
probably work..but I make no promises.;)
