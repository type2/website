Subject: Re: Help with push rod tubes

The heads do NOT need to be removed on your engine in order to re/re the 
pushrod tubes.  The tubes will pull out through the heads, after you 
remove the rocker arm assembly, which is a simple procedure.  Doing the 
push-rod tube seals can be a time consuming job, especially if the 
leaking oil has made everything around there really oily and messy.  Take 
the time to clean everything very carefully.  Although the job can take 
some time, it's pretty straight-forward mechanically.

Good luck!

&gt;  I am going to undertake the task of stopping the oil 
&gt; stains that our 80 westy just loves to leave behind. Could 
&gt; any body tell me, Do the push rod tube slide out through 
&gt; the head? Do I need to remove the head to get to them?
