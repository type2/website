Subject: quick trip on a junker 1600
Message-Id: &lt;v02130502b38619ef0899_at_[208.240.161.62]&gt;

my friend lewis and i (well, he) built a junker 1600 the other week; ok bus
case, some rot in the oil sump, he woulda thrown it away. i'm thrifty :)
used muffler, slightly used bearings and crank, the p&amp;c's outta the
workaday 1600 from the 70 (which is being rebuilt w/ berg rods and p/c's,
new bearings, crank etcetc   -  the RIGHT way!).

anyways, tho the endplay is hellacious (we just couldn't get it to set
right; figured out the problem well AFTER the thing was running) and it
rattles quite a bit at startup, the dang thing roars like a beast; ran at
60 in a head wind w/ 350 head temps and oil temps that never even flickered
the g berg dipstick sender. rpms of 3200.

good thing, too, as we had to slap together the junker to get me on my only
week of vacation this year!!
the engine will eventually be placed in the s/c as in in-towner and/or spare.
can't say recycling vw engine parts is the BEST idea (we discussed it about
6 months ago), but if you PAY ATTENTION and work carefully, ya just might
get lucky.  and frankly, its real good practice for the day when you decide
to tackle an engine job RIGHT; you might spend $200 on parts and materials
to make a pile of junk that doesn't go very far, but tearing it down and
seeing your mistakes will enable you to invest $600+ in GOOD parts w/
confidence in your skills!
