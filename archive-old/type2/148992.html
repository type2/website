&gt; So, I recently hooked my thermostat back up while the alternator

&gt; hooking up
&gt; the cable?

Yes but after the cable has been cut short it's hard to coordinate.  
I've done it enough times that I've got a system using a vice grip on  
the bar, an elbow and my hands doing the rest. If you give the cable  
too much slack it will fall off the pulley underneath.

What you can do is leave the flaps disconnected (wide open with  
spring present) and use a pair of small vice grips to keep the cable  
from flopping around or falling though the tin.

When the engine is warmed up completely attach the cable with the  
flaps in the open position so you aren't fighting the spring. As the  
thermostat cools it will pull them closed.

How warm is warm? Any highway drive for 15 minutes should open them  
up fully. I'm not sure about sub-zero temps.
