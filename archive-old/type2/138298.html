Subject: One more thing about the archives

Chris,

As you learn to use the archives as your first step in getting a 
question answered, you'll find that some of what's there is out of date 
or incomplete. For instance, if you search for &quot;heads&quot; you might find 
that a lot of people were enthralled with a place named &quot;Mark Stephens 
High Performance&quot; for heads. Well, MSHP is long gone now. There are 
lots of other things like that. The archives are starting to get a 
little long in the tooth.

But you use the archives to get a sense of all the possibilities, of 
what the problems are. Sometimes, it's when you have too much 
information that you then resort to asking the list.

Anyway, good luck.

Mark
