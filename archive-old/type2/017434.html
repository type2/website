Sounds like a good crowd is planning on making the campout in NC the
weekend of April 16th.  I'll be coming along with Sonny Flamer and John
&quot;Johnson&quot; Duerr but we won't be leaving until Friday PM (hopefully
before 7ish!).  So.....if anyone in the DC, MD, N. VA area wants to head
down with us (hey Jeff Stewart.....how about you and the fam?) let me
know.
