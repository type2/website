Subject: large engine=no heat?

Hi, I'm building a 2007cc engine for my 69 bus and was told that I shouldn't
put heater boxes on an engine that large-something about cracking the heads
after 15k or so miles. is this a legitimate concern? I live in Texas, so I'm
not really that distraut at not having heat, but it does get a little cold
here.

thanks,
jesus
