Subject: Is the starter for an 091 different than a 3 rib?

Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

I replaced the 091 6 rib trans in my bus tonight with a 3 rib unit from a 73.  The only thing that didn't jive was the starter.  It has a collar on the starter shaft that is intefering with the bellhousing causing it not to bolt up.  The two bellhousings do look different and I am wondering if I need to change the starter to an earlier model.  The bus is a 1971.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated
