Subject: Peregrine's progress

Work on Peregrine has been fallow since late February, but starts up
again this month. By September, my bus should be garaged in Flagstaff,
Arizona, where she will lead the life of a yacht. (I will be taking the
train from Oceanside, CA, to Flagstaff overnight to where I'll have
shelter and transportation patiently waiting).

Ninety percent of the work is body and paint, then a bit of mechanical
work, and finally some break-in before driving to below the summits of
the San Francisco Peaks.

I have to make way for my next project, constructing an MG TC from this
original part:

This is how much I have done:

But in order to make roof, I have to deal with this first:

Among other things.
