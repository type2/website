Subject: Re: [T2] It just died

Your symptoms suggest an electrical failure (check coil connections,
double relay plugs, temp sensor wire....ECU plug.  A problem with the
air sensor usually shows that it will start (catch) but die under any
throttle.
Why did you change the fuel pump?  Did it vibrate or whirr when cranked
by a helper as you felt it?  The tinu white/red striped wire going to
the solenoid terminal can be touched to + and you'll hear the pump.  If
doing this and the car starts, then the double relay is suspect if it
never caught even for a second. Ultmately one should see that there is
appropriate fuel pressure by putting a pressure gauge on the takeoff tap
located on the left side of the fuel rail.  If you cranked just
preciously, opening that tap will result in spray coming from it that
tells you it is under pressure. Barring that and no tiny 7mm wrench, if
you have a piece of spare hose and a pencil, one can yank the return
line leading to the fuel tank, plug the tank outlet and aim it down to
see if any gas squirts out when cranking.

So far, I've changed the fuel filter and fuel pump. Where do I go next?
Double&gt; relay? Pressure regualtor? Any adivice would be most welcome.
