Subject: Re: [T2] Belly pans?

We had a 75 westy for a long time and it indeed had a bolt on pan that went
from the front crossmember between the nonexistent &quot;Jack Sockets&quot; to the
corresponding rear crossmember.
Between the pan and floor was the corroded remains of an in line gas heater.
This seems like a much better way of getting the meagre heat to the front of
the bus .
My assumption was, as already mentioned, that this replaced the structural
integrity lost in the roof .
I also remember being under a split window camper of some sort and seeing a
similar arrangement w/out gas heater, but the pan was smooth and welded as
opposed to &quot;shaped&quot; and bolted on.
Ring any bells?

Subject: [T2] Belly pans?


&gt; Somebody recently mentioned to me that he was looking for a belly pan for
&gt; his bus. I, too, looked for such a thing when I first got mine, but was
told
&gt; by several mechanics that no such thing existed. This gentleman I've been
&gt; talking to said he'd hear that &quot;68-72's had
&gt; &gt;them, but it might have been the '60-70's.&quot; He also said he'd heard that
&gt; &gt;those belly pans had problems rusting. Does anybody else have some input
on
&gt; &gt;this? I'd love to get something under there to protect the mechanics of
the
&gt; &gt;bus, even if it would rust away itself.
