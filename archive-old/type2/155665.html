Subject: Re: [T2] Bite Sized Chunks

&gt; For $25 I'd definitely recommend you replace the coil. Mine packed it
&gt; in on the way to the Outer Banks on Easter Monday. It started as an
&gt; occaisional hiccup and got a lot less occasional within a couple
&gt; hundred miles. Problem was that the bus ran PERFECTLY at idle, so I
&gt; could not nail the problem down to a specific cylinder.
&gt;

Crap! That's exactly what mine's doing! Idles wonderfully! I have a spare
setting here too (the original Bosch one).

I keep hearing that coils just die. They don't degrade. Even though I know
better - winding shorts - I started believing them. Grrrr.........

I'll swap it in the morning before I leave for work.

Thanks!
