I checked my dwell as it was suggested my points were closing, it was right 
on 50 degrees. So I went to radio shack and asked for the diode suggested in 
the archives which is a 600 volt diode. They didn't have it, just the 400 
volt one, it's only 50 cents so i buy it. I go home and pull the old one off 
the tach and it is a 1000 volt diode, but i go ahead and stick the 400 volt 
one on to see if it works. Still acts the same, so my question is what is 
the normal voltage put out on the terminal of the coil? My tach had been 
working great for several months and it seems that 1000 volts is a lot to 
send through the one small wire, could it have simply been a power surge of 
some sort that blew it?
The archives say that the 600 volt one should work fine, so I assume there 
is less than 600 volts normally being sent?

Thanks again,
Nathan
