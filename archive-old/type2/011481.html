&gt;	Hello list. I have a 1970 Westy with a Brazilian
1600 DP motor in it. 
&lt;snippage of message to save space&gt;
This meant that only one of the top nuts removed from
inside the engine compartment, the one which holds the
starter on the upper right (fif). The other upper
mount, on the left side, because of the dog house, is
removed from under the bus. It is located right behind
the clutch lever. On my bus, there was no clearance
around the bolt to get a socket on. Part of the bell
housing casting was in the way, very close to
the bolt head. I tried a wrench, but there is no room
to move it once on. I sat and scratched my head for a
while, then went down to the FLAPS to get a
17mm &quot;crows foot&quot; wrench. This did the trick, just
barely.
&gt;	Did I have so much difficulty because the bell
housing is for the original engine? I was thinking of
using an allen head bolt when I put the engine back
in. Would this be O.K.

I had the same problem putting a 74 beetle engine in
my 65 double cab, due to slight differences in the
bell housing on the tranny.  I think using an allen
head cap screw would be a good solution (or bore the
threads out of the engine block), if I could just find
the proper bolt.

&gt;Also, the tin around my spark plugs
looked hacked up. I think that the P.O. used the
original single port tin on this dual port motor. Are
there two different styles? 

Yes, there is quite a difference between the SP and Dp
tin. I was lucky and had a complete engine with all
tin, etc.

It sure is nice to have both my bus and double cab on
the road again.
