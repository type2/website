Subject: Looking for old Friend

Looking for old Friend

In Dec 1999 we were transferred overseas and had to sell our old friend &quot;The
School Bus&quot;.   She was a Brown and white (picture here -
http://www.aircoolers_dot_org/images/09-14-2004smaller.jpg) 1969, nine passenger
bus that we had been in our family for over 15 years.  We adopted her in
1985 from her first and only owner, a minister, in Visalia, California, and
her California license Number was XML 726.   We had to let her go, she had a
few dings, but was complete and well taken care of.   A Navy Family adopted
her in December 1999.  We have been back in the states (Lemoore) for a year
and have not seen her, so I don't think she is still in the Lemoore,
California area.   I understand the family was going to make her a &quot;Hippy&quot;
or &quot;Flower Child&quot; Bus and paint her with wild colors and flowers, but I'm
not sure if that happened.  

We just want to confirm she is enjoying her new family and maybe see a
current picture.   If any one knows of her current location, it would be
greatly appreciated if you let us know.  If she were looking for a new home,
we would love to have her back.         

Thanks
