&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; my boss came in this morning after seeing my bus in the parking lot and says that he seen another bus yesterday for sale..
&gt;&gt; i asked about it but he didnt know if it was a split or bay or year or condition just seen it ,,,
&gt;&gt; i called them and they said that it is a
&gt;&gt; 69 split with a 914 flathead engine in it...
&gt;
&gt;Wow, and we thought '72 single/double cabs were rare! Lets see now...split windows ended in '67 and the Type 4 (914) engine came out in '70 in the
&gt;cars. Must be a pre-production model that has both early design (because customers complained that they didn't like the new bay window styling) and
&gt;the new engine configuration that was being developed for the next generation.
