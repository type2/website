 I'm curious about the mechanism inside of  a dual

 Is there a single diaphragm that is being pulled
 from both sides by 
 vacuum applied to the two ports on the biscuit?
 If  so, then is it a true statement that, as the
 throttle is opened 
 slightly, the point plate moves continuously from a
 position that was 
 set to give  a timing of 5 deg ATDC to a position
 corresponding to 
 the maximum vacuum-advance value allowed by the type
 of vacuum can?

Yes, there is a single plate that the arm attaches to.
But most have 2 rubber diaphragms sandwiched between
the plate halves. This way, when one tears, it won't
kill both sides.

Yes, the plate fluctuates constantly: the vacuum
over-comes spring tension and vis-versa depending on
throttle position. Decel = higher manifold vacuum =
retard. Accel = higher ported vacuum = advance.
