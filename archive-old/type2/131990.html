Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Installation

&gt; I have removed my engine from a '72 and the cart I had the engine on

&gt; chains/straps?  Any other ideas?

If this is a pancake engine, there should be two holes available at the top
of the crankcase, one near the flywheel flange and one near the oil
breather.  You can tie a rope to these.  If not, you can lever each side of
the engine onto progressively higher blocks of wood until you can get a jack
underneath (get a few pieces of 2x4).  This worked fine for me when I last
installed my engine.
