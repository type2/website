San Francisco Bay Area volks,

San Francisco Auto Repair Center offers Volkswagon repair classes, taught by
their 35-yrs experienced mechanic. There's one beginning September 10, and
one in November. Five 3-hour classes, meet on Tuesday evenings. Cost is $75.
The class covers the basics for all air-cooled VWs. There is also a generic
car repair class, six classes for $90. 

They also offer (according the flyer here) a &quot;do it yourself&quot; plan. &quot;Become
a member and you have a place to work, the tools you need and the technical
advice to get the job done.&quot; I have no info on the cost.

Phone 415 285-8588 for flyers and info. They're on Florida Street in the
sunny Mission district.

Usual disclaimer: I'm not in any way associated with SF Auto Repair (to say
the least). I brought in my bus for an estimate once, and Terry, the VW
mechanic/instructor, struck me as a thoughtful and honest guy. Went to a
cheaper place for the work, but that's neither here nor there. I'm signed up
for the September VW class, as is listmember Bren Smith.

Just thought you'd want to know.
