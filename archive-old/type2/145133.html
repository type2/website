Subject: Re: [T2] GWB is down - At a loss...

I don't believe that the cam can skip a tooth without
sever damage to the engine, it's solid gear to gear
drive, I've seen the cam gear rivets break, cam half
in two, but never the teeth on the cam and crank gears
strip or slip, without the engine stopping cold and in
pieces, big chunks. Start back at the basics,
power(12V at coil), Fuel in the tank, at and through
the carb's, Air, clear breather. check to make sure
the coil is powering to and from the points, the
condenser working, coil wire, and spark plug wires
good. Pull a 12V source from the battery to the coil
and see if that will get it to start, use a little
starting fluid.. Just to help a little. Make sure to
have the proper firing order on the distributor to the
plugs. It's got to be something simple that we are
missing. Phil
