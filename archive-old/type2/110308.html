&gt; effective on this type deposit) and a small brush and scribes and 
&gt; little screwdrivers and get every bit of crud out of there. USE A FACE 
&gt; SHIELD. You don't want even the tiniest bit of that chemical splashed 
&gt; in your eyes or up your nose, and if you do this right, it WILL spit 
&gt; back at you.

Would plain old carb cleaner do the trick?  My FLAPS has plenty of carb 
cleaners to choose from, but I couldn't find any specifically labeled 
for FI throttle bodies.

What's the NAPA cleaner made of?  Gumout carb cleaner seems to be 
mostly acetone and MEK.
