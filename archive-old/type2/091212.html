Subject: Running hot

I am new to this list, I have just gotten a 80
Westy(air cooled)- rebuilt the engine(2.0L), it seems
to be running a little hot, not knowing what it should
be thought I would ask. temp after a 20 mile run is
245 F., the oil light flickers at idle. I have not
checked the pressure yet. Phil
