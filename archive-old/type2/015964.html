Hello gang,

The disappearing gas guage needle trick must be bus unique!! My gas guage
needle does the disappearing trick when I let it get to 1/4. I was coming
back from Springfield, MO on the turnpike in NE Oklahoma, about 65 miles
&gt;from Tulsa. I decided that I had enough gas and wasn't real concerned about
it and I did make it to the eastside of Tulsa. When I pumped up with gas, I
had less than 1/2 gallon left!! So now when I go travelling, I don't let it
go below 1/4 without refueling. If your needle is disappearing at 1/2, I
would definately get it fixed !!!!
