Jupiters are available in a 6-ply rated version, size 185R14 Reinforced that
exceeds the VW specs for load carrying and inflation, and now also in an
8-ply rated version.

Some of us have had very good results with these tires in all kinds of
conditions, off-road and on.  The 6-ply rated version is selling for around
$60.00/tire at Les Schwab tire centers, but other outlets also carry them.

FWIW.....
