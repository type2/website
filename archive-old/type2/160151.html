PS  learned items:
1- beefing up one part of an engine will cause the weak link  to fail, 
that's why staying stock is safer
2- heavy duty valve springs  require upgrading rocker shafts, swivel 
adjusters, and/or lash caps
3-  stainless valves require matching hardened adjusting screws
4- RMMW  lifetime warranty parts--rot in  hell

----------------------------------------------------------------------


hey will    staying stock isnt alway good, certain things  like the rocker 
shafts are a somewhat poor design and the good replacement  shafts are a lot 
stronger. be careful of the quality of some swivel  adjusters.  i put a set of 
gene bergs that Tedebare had on his engine and  broke the ends off when i tried 
to adjust them. they said they were a bad  batch  ???  I do not like the type 
that use an allen wrench to adjust  them , makes the ends very weak. heavy 
springs and lash caps also need to be of  good quality, as i have seen brand new 
heavy springs break.I made a tool to  remove the springs on the bus using a 
flat piece of steel bent 90 degrees  ,drilled a hole close to the bend and 
cutting a U shaped notch on the end so as  to get to the keeper. take the valve 
loose by putting air into the clylinder.and  bolting the bar on the rocker studs 
and levering the spring down to remove the  keepers. you can also stuff rope 
in the clylinder but that is harder to  do.  lifetime warrenties won't work if 
the company quits :) have fun and  surf a wave for me  later  mark dearing
