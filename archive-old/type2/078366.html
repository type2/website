I'm not going to Havasu but I routinely attend an East coast and West coast campout about once a year.  If it's still in the East by next year I could probably get it at Blue Ridge or High Country and bring it back to Dallas, and then perhaps out West a few months later...  Or maybe swimsuit-model Dolan could bring it West on one of his treks?

&gt;It's sure be nice to see it at BBBV!  Any eastcoasters making the big trip
&gt;to Havasu?
