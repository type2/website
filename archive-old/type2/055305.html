Jim -

I have one of those, and they're great. Just make sure you don't burn any
grass that may be underneath it. Another option is to get an old, free, junk
clothes washer and extract the tub part of it. It's less wide than the
outdoor fireplace and it'll fit (OBC) in the Bus easier. It'll also hold the
firewood you need for a day or two, so you don't have to make more room
(OBC) in the Bus for the wood.

Camp on (OBC) Bussers!!

&gt; MSRP $99.95 and get Coleman's cool new outdoor fireplace.
