Subject: Urgent Clutch Help Needed!!!

This morning while driving out of my apartment complex, I pushed in the
clutch, then all of a sudden it fell to the floor and did not come back up.
I managed to limp back to my apartment and park it.
I can move it up and down freely from underneath the bus, there is no
tension what so ever.

Any ideas what may have caused this problem? Im still a VW novice so I need
help! Quick!! This is my Daily Driver!
BTW, its a 77 Westy Bus

Thanks in advance
Eric
