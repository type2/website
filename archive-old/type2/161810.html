&gt; I've been thinking about making a short fitting that is M10 male on
&gt; one end and M10 female with flats on the other so the oil pressure
&gt; sender can simply stand off rather than require a long hose to
&gt; relocate it elsewhere. The fitting would be the same size of the hole
&gt; in the oil pressure sender grommet to the tin would remain sealed.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone think vibration will be an issue? I just want to raise
&gt; the sender just enough so it can be tightened easily.


I have pretty much this exact thing on my bus. It is made from two brake
line fittings brazed together with a short piece of brake line in between.
It does vibrate a bit but no harm done so far in about 2+ years.
