&gt; I have a question about muffler heat.  In my 78, I have converted to
&gt; the 72-74 style of heater boxes/muffler.  All shields and flappers and
&gt; everything else is in place and working.  The muffler is a stock stainless
&gt; steel one from BD correct for the 72-74 setup.
&gt;
&gt; However, my rear bumper gets really really hot!  Is this normal?
&gt; The engine temps are very normal at about 210 or so.

the stock muffler from VW had an asbestos sandwich heat shield between it
and the bumper.   had a significant effect.
