Subject: 1981 Westfalia for sale in Austin TX

------=_NextPart_000_0261_01C200E9.23AC7580

Hello folks,

I'm selling my 81 Westfalia in order to upgrade to some sort of camper =
that has seat belts in the back seat - we're having a baby and my wife =
and I wouldn't trust a JC Whitney seat belt installation with our baby's =
chair.  Details of the rig can be found at =
http://www.geocities_dot_com/cdarilek2000/VanagonWestfalia1981.htm

Sink works, stove works, frig works (haven't tried it on gas though).

I've owned it for about a year and a half over which I put toooo much =
money in it and don't expect to get much out now - I'm asking $3500.

Thanks,
Chris Darilek
Austin TX
