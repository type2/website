Subject: Re: Where would you go in your VW? &lt;a friday question&gt;

&gt;Do we have any Funkengruvin members among us?  How comprehensive is the book
&gt;you get with membership of VW repair/parts places around the US?  Is it
&gt;worth joining to get this?

I'm a Fungengroovin member, at least I get the magazine.  But I haven't
received that book yet although there's lots about it in all of the mags.
I can't locate one right now, but I don't think its a join and get the
directory thing.  If it is, I have a feeling its not even compiled and done
yet.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I'll go look at that webpage and see if it says
anything.
