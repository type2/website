71 to 79.
Not 68 to 70, the latch assembly is completely different.


&gt; The tail gate on my '71 Westy is pretty badly rusted on the inside and it
&gt; also has a big dent under the window.  I want to replace it with a used
one
&gt; from the local Pick-N-Pull, but I'm not sure what years are compatible
with
&gt; my '71.  My &quot;seat of the pants&quot; feeling is that '68 thru '79 are
&gt; interchangeable.  Can anyone confirm that?
