Hi,

Some folks I know have a 71 Westy (?) poptop they are interested in
selling, but I don't know a lot about it.  It has had a recent motor
overhaul from a very good mechanic.  Some local vandels $crewed up the
tent in the pop-top.  I think it's almost road worthy, probably been
sitting for a while.  They say the body's pretty decent, but I have not
seen it.  Not sure about price.  If you're in the market fot a 71 Westy
and are feeling adventurous, email me and I'll put you in touch with the
sellers.  They are in Plattsburg, MO, just north of Kansas City.
