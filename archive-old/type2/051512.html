Subject: [T2] headlight buckets

The PO of my Westy crumpled the front end many years ago.  The headlights
didn't aim very well so I pulled the buckets out to see if I could
massage some metal &quot;just enough&quot; to fix it.  These buckets are not in
good shape.  Is a bucket a bucket a bucket?  What interchanges?  Can I
just order a set Beetle bucket from a magazine vendor?  I must not be
using a good enough keyword 'cause I couldn't find them at BusDepot or I
missed it in the long list of body parts.

Thanks,
John
