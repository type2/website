&lt;&lt;  Anyone have a VW reference that lists displacement by motor numbers?? I &gt;&gt;
The EA an WA 1.7's where also used in the 914's as well as the Type 4's.
Here's some specs for the EA.
Weight 277 lbs.
Displacement 1679 cc	
Bore 90mm
Stroke 66mm
Fuel Injection Specs
8.2:1 compression
Fuel Octane 98
Power Output, DIN HP  80 _at_ 4900 RPM
Torque mkg 13.5 din _at_ 2800 RPM
Normal Compression 128-156 psi
The carbed engines couldn't quite keep up with the fuelies, they had 7.8:1
compression and pushed 68 HP _at_ 4500 RPM.
  I have an EA in my wife's 412 wagon.  These are hot little engines.  I am
proud to say that this little wagon is the fastest air cooled VW I've ever
driven (sort of the 914).  And it never ceases to amaze me the look on fellow
VW drivers as I blow there doors off in the old ladys grocery getter.  Not bad
for Volkswagen's Edsel.
  Peace, Love, and you gotta be hard core to drive a type 4!
