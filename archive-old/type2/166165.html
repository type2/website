Subject: Looking for a voltage regulator in Oregon - 0 192 062 007

Ok, so I'm still having issues with my low voltage.  I don't know why, 
but the voltage on my regulator starts at 14 and drops to 12.5 after 
running a while.

So, my first step is upgrading my mechanical regulator and I'd like to 
upgrade to a solid state one.  Does anyone know where in Oregon 
(preferably southern Oregon), I can find the part recommended on Richard 
Atwell's site:

0 192 062 007

It's from Bosch.. supposed to be good.  Any recommendations?

It would be nice if I could get it sometime this weekish... as I'm 
driving back down sometime this week.  I *might* go up towards portland 
and/or Bend, but not totally sure.

Then, if that doesn't work, I'm gonna go with the Balmar ARS-5 instead.

Thanks!
Mike
