Hi Volks!

&gt; A few years ago, Erik, Tobin Copley, Everett Barnes, and I conspired to
&gt; deface an ad for a Lexus SUV, putting a bus in place of the offending
&gt; vehicle in an &quot;adbuster&quot; style spoof. The moment of truth is archived
&gt; at:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/014826.html
&gt; 
&gt; But the site in that posting is gone. I know I have found the ad on
&gt; some other site, but now I can't remember where. 

It's on mine:
http://www.gerbelmann_dot_de/lexus/

&gt; Anyway, welcome back to a first-rate co-conspirator.

Thanks!  Most appreciated.

One thing though: Please do not send me a copy of mail
directed to the list.  I get it twice then, and since the
list mail is collected in a different folder I read later
than the normal mail folder, I tend to answer mail in
private that should really go to the list.  Thank you.
(This is not directed at Mark specifically, but at 
everyone.)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
