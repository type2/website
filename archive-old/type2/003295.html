Volks,
I am taking  a set of rods to the machinist, and I want him to cut the notch
in the side per the official vw tech update that is about ten years old.
The same update talked about eliminating the head gasket.......I need to get
this online to print out.  I know it is on a page somewhere but I cannot
recall where......please help.
