Subject: RE: [T2] Recomended Gearbox shops.

  Rancho will rebuild an automatic (r/p and/or gearbox) but not the brain.
The Converter shop here in Lake Havasu will rebuild your torque converters.
They also manufacture new auto (bus) imput shafts, r/p carriers and other
assorted auto parts to beef up the trans. They also have someone who
rebuilds them for them (performance only). Type 4 auto's are the hottest
item in the off road crusier world now and are in big demand out here on the
west coast.

ps. AUDI and some other German marks use the same gearbox section as the
bus, only the r/p section is different. I have heard of an AUDI 5 speed auto
being put in a bus.
