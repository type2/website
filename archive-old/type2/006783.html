&gt;Oh, well.  It is a great test, it tells you alot about your cylinders and
&gt;the valves,
&gt;is cheap and easy to perform (if you have a prop to hold onto).
&gt;
&gt;The setup -- regulator, gauge, valve hoses, etc. as a unit is commonly
&gt;available from
&gt;aircraft tool places, they cost about $50 (sometimes less) for cheap ones.

     Cool idea. Didn't think of making my own, I was thinking of the
shiny Snap-On guage my buddy out in Victorville has. He has a shop so he
has all the cool tools... Seems like his
pretty-shiny-all-in-one-Snap-On-leak-down-tester was something like
$150+, but I may be off on the low side... But in retrospect it seems to
be a fairly simple tool to fabricate from spare parts. Maybe Sir Hoover
can suggest a method using 1/4-20 stock and a couple of old coffee cans?
And a used oscilating fan for air supply? ;-) ;-) ;-)

Peace,
