Subject: Re: [VB] Pulling the Generator without dropping the engine

you should be able to change your generator with the motor in...
I changed an intake manifold with the engine in (back in my silly days ...or
should I say daze.... of ignorance).  It took me a cool 7 or so hours of
frustration and a pack of camels...but I did it.
I also got the generator out somehow....and this was a single port 1600....I
can't believe I even tried that...now I would just pull the motor...hehehe

so yes...it IS possible..it takes a lot of jiggling though!
