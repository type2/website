Subject: Re: bus security (paranoids exposed)

&gt;have an ugly car.   Faded paint, a dent or two, tatty old curtains.    Leave
&gt;old pepsi bottles and food wrappers on the floor.   Some spare clothes, dirty
&gt;socks, some dog eared paperback, and empty cigarette packs.   Who'll want to
&gt;go in there, there wouldn't be anything worth while anyway.     Don't lock
&gt;it, and leave the key in the ignition.

This is my personal strategy.  Well, the unlocked, key in ignition (most of
the time), dirty, full of stuff tactic has worked well.  Once in a while I
vacuum and get everything clean, but the stuff just has no where else to
go.  My car always looks like someone's living in there.  Had some stuff
stolen about three years ago, locked the doors at work from then on, but
not anymore.  I know I'm gonna get flamed for this, but its the truth.  The
outside is just way more interesting, so I figure people don't even bother
with looking around inside for anything of value.
