Just for the record,
	The  &quot;black&quot; window handles did not match the handles in  my 76, nor did they
match either of the mis-matched handles in my wifes 79. However, for  $1.98
they roll the window up and down really well. Especially handy for venting the
bus interior and paying tolls in the way to and from work........Johnny
