&gt; I have an oil pressure gauge in my 80 Caddy and 85 Cabriolet.  Both are
&gt; good, but your Vanagon already has a decent oil pressure warning system.
&gt; If it goes below 0.3BAR the oil pressure light and buzzer will go on...
&gt; works for me.

If the '80 has the L-board system that the later Vanagons have, then that 
high/low circuitry can go bad.  That's what happened on my '87 and I really 
like having the oil pressure gauge.

Having been stuck in another vehicle for half a day once with a bad idiot light 
sender when there really was no oil pressure problem (but we didn't know), I 
think it's worth it to have the gauge.

It's a fairly simple add on...even I was able to do it.  :-)

YMMV.
