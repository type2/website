Subject: something is not right... what i mean is...
Message-ID: &lt;19991012171211.B23472_at_source.rebelbase_dot_com&gt;

when my email came down the pipe... and i re-read it as 
if i were someone trying to determine what in the holy
heck i was trying to say...

as for the popping during deceleration...
i didn't mean for it to sound like i was asking 
about the gear popping out during deceleration.

the engine... is giving out little pups, pup-pup
pup pup  puppup pup pup.

little exasperated puuhps.

perhaps that sounds a little like a timing/distributer
problem than popping during deceleration?

it happens  during idle as well.
the main concern is that they turn into stronger 
pops, like mini backfires during deceleration...
pop, pop-pop, pop pop.

seems like a timing/spark misfire to me... 
hence the &quot;backfireing&quot; similarity... 
but as i said, i checked timing, point gap, 
spark plugs.. etc...

i do have some more diagnostics to do...
however, i was specifically asking if my distributer
motion [the plate to which the points fasten to] is normal,
or not supposed to be happening.

if it's not... see, then i would think its that... which
would also account for the change in idle speed...back and forth.
or is this the dizzy making adjustements, and actually HOW it makes
those adjustements.

1600 dual port
bosch .009
solex 34 pict 3
2 outlet biscut vaccume advance
no apparent vaccume leaks.

please help.
