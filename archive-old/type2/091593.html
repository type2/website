&gt; Step #12 demonstrated spray the backs of the brake

&gt; copper spray lube before installation.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Does anyone do this as a regular habit?
&gt; 
&gt; Does it make it a lot easier to put in new pads with
&gt; a new rotors?

------------------------------------------------------Don't
know if it make's it easer to install but it does help
prevent squeeling, have been doing it for 30 years on
different cars, also if a dab is put on the shoe guide
on the drum brakes it helps them to position better,
just don't get any of it on the pad side on either
brakes(drum or rotor) Phil
