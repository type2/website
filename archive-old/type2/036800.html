Subject: RE: Computer spark plugs

I tried platinum plugs in 1600 DP and SP engines. In both cases, 
the plugs deteriorated faster than the regular plugs. The gap
widened because the center electrode shrunk. That may be due to 
heat. Has anyone on the list had a good experience with platinum
plugs? Are my engines running hotter than normal? I don't think so.

Archives do not clarify but add that Platinums have no advantage over OEM 
plugs. What's a dummy to believe? Please deconfuse me
