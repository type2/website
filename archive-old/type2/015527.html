&gt;Hey Tim, I just used the most expensive bottle of Techron in my Type2 79
&gt;auto tranny Westy. It's 12.00 a bottle up here in Cana-duh. :-) Is it worth
&gt;the money? Will one bottle do any good? I'd hate to have to do this every
&gt;fillup.

Read my post again. DO NOT use these detergent addatives more than once
every several thousand miles. They are only for occasional maintenance and
too much can cause problems with fouled spark plugs. The cheap stuff may
advise you use it every tankfull, but that's just how cheap stuff is
marketed. I wouldn't use that stuff even once. Techron may suggest every 3
tanks. Bull-roar!! If you are recontaminated in that short of time, the
solution lies elsewhere, not in another quicky shot of detergent
concentrate. If you don't note results with the good stuff from one
treatment, your problem is not likely contamination and another can is
wasted money. 

&gt;&gt; Follow instructions. If you use these
&gt;&gt; addatives too much it will surely foul your plugs. Just a one shot
&gt;&gt; treatment every 10-20k or 2 years. More available is the Chevron Techron.
&gt;&gt; They make several grades. Insure results by buying the spendier high
&gt;&gt; detergent blend, but it costs even more than the Jectron.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; STAY AWAY FROM LOSS LEADER ADDATIVES. If they worked well, they wouldn't
&gt;&gt; need spezial pricing to match the low values received from panaceas.
