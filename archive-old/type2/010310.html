With *considerable* help from readers, I found out that I had committed 
a BoneHead(tm) - I took the distributor out w/o making sure cyl 1 was at
TDC. (&quot;Gee, why doesn't it start?')

After using the valves to get things aright and re-installing the
distributor (then re-gapping the new points and static timing), Rebecca
surged to life and is running as well as she ever has.

My profound thanks to all who guided this tune-up newbie through what
was a terrifying time.

Cheers,
Norm Gall
