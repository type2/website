Subject: flywheel replacement

some may recall last summers adventures trying
to get my main seal to stop leaking.

Since I'm preparing to bolt out of Iowa to any state
that has mountains, water, and a job, I figured I'd
try to get some problems squared away on my bus.

My flywheel has a smallish groove worn in it from the seal
rubbing.  Do the reconditioned units have no groove at all?
Or is some kind of wear acceptable?
 
I haven't seen what I'd consider to be an afforable flywheel 
replacement.  I could fill the wear in with JBWeld and finish
the surface by hand. Or, alternately, do machine shops have
an easy way to regrind them? I can build it back up with weld (actual
metal),
but I don't have a way to refinish the surface, aside from spending
a few days with emory paper and wet sanding the thing.

thanks for the time....
