&gt; Well, this has been done to death. Just fill the freaking thing with a good 
&gt; GL-4 lube or Redline MT-90 and Shut the F*&amp;k up. ( to borrow a saying from 
&gt; D. Leary). Christ, you folks should know better than to argue with the 
&gt; newbies, it never works out. Let 'em fry a tranny or two......They'll 
&gt; figure it out then.
