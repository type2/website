Subject: Re: [T2] Federal Carb??

I think Dederal is just one of the many domestic rebuilder companies.

The questions is though - is it a top of the stack rebuilder or bottom of 
the stack?

Have to compared prices with Bus Depot and the other list suppliers?


&gt;Anyone ever hear of a &quot;Federal&quot; brand 34pict3 carb?  What do you know about
&gt;them?
&gt;The guy at my FLAPS says he can get me one for relatively cheap but I don't
&gt;want to spend ANY cash on some third world piece of scrap metal.

Compare warranties too.
