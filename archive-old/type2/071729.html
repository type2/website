Subject: finally got it off (gas tank screen)
Message-ID: &lt;f08af4d9.243ea83a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Well after a few hours this morning my friend in his trusty Volvo picked me 
up so I wouldn't get in trouble for truceny, in which case I was informed I 
had received detention for &quot;skipping&quot; half the day, because I was having fun 
spilling gas all over my face I guess.  ANYWAY, when I got home and after 
many coats of WD-40 and a suggestion of putting carb cleaner gumout crap in 
the tank and ran that through a few times to loosen rust on the inside, and 
yanking on it with needle nose for all i'm worth, i finally pulled it off the 
spout thingy spiilling more gas into my eyes and face and gettting a nice 
deep breath of it, and then managed to rip the filter out, i think the washer 
is still attached i'll look at that tommorrow.  I'm going to run some gas 
through it a few times to try and wash out as much crap as I can, I guess I 
need to order a new filter, anyone know what kind where to order one, I found 
them in Motorworks's Mag, but the year and chassis numbers didn't match up, 
also I guess I&quot;ll need a new seal?  I figure I'll replace the pushrod while 
there isn't any gas in it, if doing both of these doesn't fix the problem, 
anyone want to buy a bus?  ha HA

Thanks much for everyone's help, slow and erratic progress on the &quot;Ghetto 
Cruiser&quot; wouldn't of been possible without you.
