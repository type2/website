As some of you may know, I replaced the heads on my '77 2L awhile ago,
after the #2 spark plug blew out while traveling from Tucson to
Sacramento. I am planning on taking her on a road trip the first week in
July, and so I would like to retorque the heads before I go. I understand
from the archives that this is recomended at 500 miles, and the standard
way of doing this is to drop the engine. I also read though that VW did
not do this on new engines. Is that correct? 

It seems from the diagrams in the Bentlys (and my not so sharp memory of
how things went together) that it should be possible to take off the
intake mannifolds, the air cleaner and a few other parts of the top of the
engine, and remove the tin that is covering the top four bolts without
having to do all the work of removing the engine. What am I missing that
would prevent me from doing this? Is there more tin then the top cover
that I have forgotten about? Would going this way be more work than
dropping the whole engine? I really only have a weekend to do this in, and
so I am trying to minimize the risk that the bus will not be back together
in time for the trip. What are the risks if I don't do this before the
trip, and wait until after? Anybody in the Sacramento area interested in
helping/watching me do this? Anybody have recomendations on mechanics in
the Sacramento area if I get stuck and need the help of a pro?

Thanks,
-Nick (Still learning about these beloved things!)
