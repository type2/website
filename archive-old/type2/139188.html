Subject: RE: [T2] Twisted frame??

Timothy,

Find out who they're insured with. It's part of their cost of doing
business. You should be compensated for the expense of repairs. That's why
you paid the extra money and had a &quot;professional&quot; do the work rather than
doing it yourself.

Keep everything, take notes. Find all your receipts for major work like a
new paint job, recent engine rebuild. Not nickel &amp; dime stuff. Be sure their
adjuster knows what you have, and have a spare copy of everything to give
him. Keep everything, take notes.

Good luck,

Andy McKinley

As they raised the 77 VW High Roof, the left set of
floor hoist arms lifted and slipped. They caused my van to shift
horizontally to the right and bounce before they right arms balanced the
van. Now, the rear cargo door over the engine won't shut without
pressing on the left bottom part of the door.
