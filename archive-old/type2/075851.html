Subject: Re: [T2]  locking engine hatch + FIRES  TRUE



&gt; And another note, aren't most of the first in VW busses caused by old,
cracked
&gt; fuel lines?  If you change your lines, what else would cause a fire?  just
&gt; curious?

&gt; Mike

Let's see a hose popping off it's connection, yes clamp the fuel lines but it
can still happen and Electrical fires happen too.  There may be the chance
that you can catch the fire early enough to put it out yourself.  Which is all
I want to do.  If you have to call the fire dept, odds are the fire has been
burning for a while and by that time I agree the engine lid would be too hot
to open.  But when it first starts, you may have a chance and a chance is
better than nothing.

For me an unlocked engine compartment door when driving.

Peace brothers and Sisters,

&gt; &gt; Hi John Here
&gt; &gt;  Sorry but any Fireman approaching a VW bus will not open the lid, so
don't
&gt; &gt; worry about the lock. I lock mine because of my security system is back
&gt; &gt; there. I know when I am on the move my lid is not locked because I usually
&gt; &gt; check the oil before I move out. Firemen will approach and shoot foam or
&gt; &gt; other material through the engine vent intake. The lid keeps o2 from the
&gt; &gt; fire. Besides if its on fire I don't think you can go near that lid, too
dame
&gt; &gt; hot!
