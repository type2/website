Subject: [T2] NC Local Bus Club and AIRS

On Sat. nite about 10:30 the phone rang. A young women quickly
introduced herself and told me that she had my name from the AIRS
list. She and her boyfriend had just purchased a bus (1967 Westy)that
day in northern Va. and were on their way home to FL. After they
stopped in Greensboro for gas they could not get the bus to go into
gear. After playing twenty questions I gave them my address and told
them they could have it towed to my house and we would have a look in
the morning.
They arrived about midnight and we chatted about this and that and
decided that perhaps there was a failure of the clutch or perhaps the
throw out bearing fork. This was their first bus and they had it for
less the 5 hours and did not know a lot about VWs. We all know how
much I know :)
In the morning I called LBC member Chad Sibert and asked him if we
could borrow a clutch off of junk motor and he was more then happy to
do so. After picking up the clutch we proceeded with motor pulling
101. After everything was disconnected and the motor was hanging by
the studs , LBC member John Stainkamp roared up in the driveway in
his 61 DC. Whenever John pulls up I feel like the calvary has arrived
:)
We pulled the motor but much to our chagrin the clutch, fork and all
related parts were fine. The owner of the bus jumped in and tried to
put it through the gears. Many loud clunks were heard. Uh oh! The
plug was removed from the tranny. The magnetic plug was covered in
bright shavings and the tranny only yielded a cup full of brown goo.
The axle boots were in bad shape but there was no major evidence of
gear oil all over the place. The tranny had been dry for some time.
LBC member Roy Nilsen was summoned to obtain the only gallon of
Stalube GL4 that was to be found on a Sunday morning. We hoped in
vain that by filling the tranny back up it might help unstick itself.
We also fussed endlessly with a stupid Hurst shifter that had no
doubt been installed by the same idiot that painted the dash and the
steering wheel brown. The bus would not come out of third gear.
We gave it everything we had. Sadly the bus left the same way it came
- on the back of a tow truck. I am sorry that we could not fix the
bus but I am glad that we were able to try. Thanks to John, Chad and
Roy for putting up a good fight and spending a day trying to help
some strangers in a bus make it home. They truly appreciated it!
