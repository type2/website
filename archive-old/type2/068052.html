Subject: '54 barndoor around town

Today I was going to give Bugster a complete tune up including steering gear
box oil change, lube front end, and redo rear brakes.  (yes I know this is
not a type1 list, sorry if i offended anybody).   

Well, this was partially done ( it has the rear wheels off the ground as I
type), but I got distracted, and ended up running around in the 54 barndoor
kombi.  Took my friend's extra kitten to the adoption people (not the pound).
  We parked in the gas station across the street from the pet people, to get
some gas.    Unfortunately  the battery was low, and wouldn't start. (It did
start at home   : (  ? )   And while I was paying for gas, this woman in an
huge El Dorado, not that is any other kind, parked six inches from the rear
bumper .  So we pushed the bus forward a couple feet, and, much to the
continued amusement of the people filling their tanks, took out the crank and
started it up.    Much, much, much better than push starting.   Happy happy,
joy, joy.   We're on our way....

So Jan and I exposed a roll of film taking pictures of Old Blue    (Ol'
Blew?), which shall be posted on Zack web page prolly next week, if they come
out any good.

Back home the bus got an oil change, though it hasn't had 3000 miles this
year, I have seen engine cases that had old oil eat them an I shudder.    It
has a magnet on the oil sump plate, and I am glad to be able to just say no
metal shavings.

BTW, I saw a bumper sticker on a bus that said   &quot;Fast Cars Suck&quot;
