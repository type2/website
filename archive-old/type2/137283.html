Subject: cutting into a floor

Hi all.... I'm hoping to be able to talk the local auto wrecker into 
letting me cut into the floor of the badly crunched (front end) 71 they 
have for floor replacement material.  What am I likely to run into when 
I do?  How often is the flooring material welded to the cross 
members/supports etc?  What's the best way to go about this?  I need the 
flooring for the areas along the drivers side of the '74 Kombi.
