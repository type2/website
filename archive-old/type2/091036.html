Subject: Re: [T2] rear main seal, oil leak

I'm gonna guess you mean front seal (front is front) the one that is
pointed toward the tranny. this isn't a very hard seal to replace but
you do have to pull the engine. As far as damaging the seal when
installing the engine, don't know but just installing an engine would
be not likely to damage the seal. This seal is located behind the
flywheel so you would have damaged it if that went bad. 

But I'm basically just guessing here. More info would be helpful. Some
of the nice info would be what year bus, what size engine, how many
miles. Without this we really can't help w/ what you may/may not have
to do.

&gt; I have an idea that the oil drips that I am experiencing is a blown

&gt; the rear seal a bear to get at?  I probably have to rip the engine
&gt; down completely, eh?  I think I may have damaged it when installing
&gt; the engine last time.  Was I too careless?  Am I experiencing bad
&gt; Karma?  AM I GOING OUT OF MY MIND?????  At this point, probably when
&gt; I'm ready for hauling the engine and doing this, I may as well do an
&gt; overhaul?
