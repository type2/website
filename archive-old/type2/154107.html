Subject: Fw: [T2] Fw: 1978 bus Air flow meter problem?

Any advice appreciated.  This fuel Injection is a new issue, the rest of her
is pretty good



 Suggestion

 Disconnect the double relay, and fuel pump wires. run a &quot;temp&quot; wire from
the battery to the fuel pump, and hook a ground up to the other side,
respecting the polarity + and -, check fuel pressure at the rail, should be
30-40psi.
 If that worked, turn the key and and fire it up.   does it keep running?
Now you know the fuel pump and the rest of the fuel feeding on the system is
good, so back to the system that feeds the pump power.  Reverse what you did
so far.

Open the Bentley test double relay function on page 8, paying particular
note to the note on the top right hand side of the page if you recently
replaced the starter.

 How did it test, which part of the test failed?

 Thats the first step, and probably what the &quot;VW guy&quot; would do.
