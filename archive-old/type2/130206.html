Subject: Re: [T2] Rust and rubber was:I'm new at this...

&lt;snip&gt;

I would like to try and keep it running and do the same with my wife
and my 2 year old son. 

&lt;unsnip&gt;

Well you 2 year old will keep going on his own for quite sometime as kids have WAY too much energy for such a small body. As for you wife, she might need several products from the geriatric isle at the store if she's slowing down all ready. I'm just a couple years older and already feel like I'm slowing down! &lt;grin&gt;

Sorry - it's Friday!!! Just teasing you...

Anyhow - great project for great reasons! 

Rust - kill it now or it will consume your bus. Patch panels can be found in all the VW catalogs. Terry is our resident paint expert and can advise you further. Search the archives for RUST and you will find much wisdow. There are all sorts of ways to tackle rust - and not all involve cutting it out and replacing the metal. 

Suppliers: look at www.type2_dot_com for links. Same with www.vanagon_dot_com.  

www.aircooled_dot_net
www.busdepot_dot_com

Are just a couple... You can get darn near anything for these busses.
