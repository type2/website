Hey Y'all,
  I am going to have to sell one of my Busses. Its a 73 with Automatic
trans and a 2.0L with stock PDSIT's. Its blue/white, black intereior.
Good points are; rebuilt carbs straight body, no rust, runs  Bad
points; #3 valve burned so comp is low on #3 only. middle seat is gone
and headliner is shot. I am asking $400 OBO.
  I also have a engine hatch and rear cargo hatch for free, just come
and get them. They are off a 73 and are near perfect. I'm near Tacoma Wa.
