Subject: It's Out! Thanks! [was: Re: Type I Engine Pull, frozen pilot
 bearing?]


In regard to my engine which was stuck to my trans: Bob Hoover, Ron Van
Ness and Wouter De Waal thought I should try removing the starter and then
try to unbolt the clutch pack from the flywheel by working through that
hole where the starter was. (Statistically, the Dutch appear to have a
flair for sticky engine removal problems. I dunno why. 8)

It can be done, and it can be done with the driveline still in the bus.
Requires a 13mm crowsfoot wrench on a short extension, all on a large flex
ratchet (13mm offset box will take them out once they're started but it
can't get enough grip to start them, will round them off instead).
Meanwhile you brace the engine the other way with a flex handle and your
knee. It's not that tough if you get the rear end off the ground so you can
work.

They are apart and I can see what I'm doing, confident I can deal with it
from here, THANK YOU to everybody who replied.
