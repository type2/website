Subject: headlight eyebrows for type 2? plus an oil drip and other junk
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

1)I always thought those eyebrow thingys that go on the headlights looked neat
on some cars.  I've seen them on busses, but only seen them in mags for
beatles.  Anyone know where I could find them?

2)Also there seems to be some oil dropping from my newly installed mechanical
fuel pump every once and again, should I just take it off, clean the gasket,
and put some sealer on it or something?

3)my gas mileage seems to have gone down the toilet after I installed the new
fuel pump, I'm pretty sure I don't have any fuel leaks, think I just got such
awesome mileage before because I was basically running on a fuel pump that was
dying?

4)I'm looking for some dope hubcaps to put on this spring, the ones I have I
like but they're scratched to crap, the ones I have are the chrome with the VW
in the middle, but it isn't raised, anyone know where to find a new set of
those?

IN THE REVERSE,
Tripps
