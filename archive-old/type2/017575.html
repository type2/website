Subject: Towing capacity?

Does a '71 bus with a 1600 engine have any towing capacity?  Stop
laughing!  I was thinking about a little, teeny trailer that would be
used on trips to get some of the lighter, more bulky stuff like sleeping
bags, clothing and blankest out of the bus so the kids have more room to
stretch out on trips--instead of being wedged in like cargo!

Thanks, Lauria Watts
