Subject: WANTED: 71 Westy (with certain features)

Looking for a good solid (least rust-thru as possible) 71 Westy... WITH... 
NON-WALKTHRU front ! Sorry clan but I like the spare tire stash, and the 
ability for my honey to sit next to me.

It can be motor-less, and trans-less, and rough/stripped, as I plan on 
stripping it, and doing a total rebuild. Could also be sans interior... but 
need the fiberglass top (or at least the hole in the roof, and I'll purchase 
a top.

PS: The reason I want the 71 is the indicator lenses front and back, small 
5-lug pattern, and power brakes. I am willing to accept a 68-70, if it has 
the NON-WALKTHRU front (and I'll add the other stuff on in time).

Pictures would be appreciated, but small files, as I have a firewall.
