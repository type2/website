&gt; Hi All, 
&gt; 
&gt; Since driving my bus for about 2 months now, I've
&gt; come to the conclusion
&gt; that there's only about 1 other bus in this area
&gt; (Pasco County, Florida)
&gt; that anybody actually *drives*  

Seattle area has quite a few, but when there's snow in
the weather forecast, suddenly they crawl out from
under rocks, I think! Every neighborhood has a few
(Seattle City) It's almost like some kind of insect
that comes out of burrows in the ground (to mate) only
when there's snow in the air! -BaH
