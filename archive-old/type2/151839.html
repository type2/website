Subject: Re: [T2] small holes in my heater boxes

Dan,

While I haven't tried any of this that I bought yet, it should work fine 
for heater boxes....the outside of the box should not ever see 1,000 
degrees.

I would *not* use JB weld for heater boxes.

I bought it to use on some small bumper parts that I intend to powder 
coat(400F).

Cheers, dave

&gt; I have some small holes in the outer skins of my heater boxes on my 78

 is an option for the time being.  Can I patch the holes with something
 like JB Weld or some other similar type product, or does the amount of
 heat make sealing it like that difficult?  I certainly don't want that
 stuff to start to cook and give off any fumes that could make it into the
&gt; passenger compartment.
