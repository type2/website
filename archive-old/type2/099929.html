Subject: RE: Porsche Mags

&gt;I am in the market for some 911 porsche mags for my 1972 bus. 

Be aware that wheel adapters, necessary for running Porsche wheels on your
bus, are not the best from a safety point of view.  The adapters provide a
weak point.  In fact, Porsche Club (and SCCA) rules prohibit the use of
wheel adapters for any autocross or high speed event.  Which means I
wouldn't be allowed to use them on my 2000 pound 914.  And your bus weighs a
lot more than that.

That being said, it's your bus and your decision.  You may want to do a
little research and decide WHICH 911 &quot;mags&quot; you want.  5-spoke Fuchs?
Cookie cutters?  Phone dials?  Personally I think the phone dials look good
on a bus (and they're more affordable than some of the others).  Check some
of the online swap pages for Porsches and maybe peruse eBay to see what's
available.

&gt;have to change the other side and then work on the front end.  The front
end be a first also.  Any advise?

Check out the tech articles on the type2 home page - you'll find everything
you need to know about front ends and a whole lot more!  Go to www.type2_dot_com
and click on &quot;Library&quot; then on &quot;Front End&quot; and you'll see all the
appropriate articles.
