Subject: RE: [T2] Heads up, CIP has Type2 thermostats right now.

&gt; Just checking their catalogue and tucked away on one of the pages
&gt; are Type2 thermostats german made, but 75 bucks! Ouch!!! But hey, that is
&gt; Canadian, so that's about 45 bucks US for a real thermostat.


Not that much of a bargain, once you pay your credit card's exchange rate
surcharge plus shipping (unless, of course, you happen to live in Canada).
I sell them for $47.50 with listmember discount, and you only pay shipping
from Pennsylvania.

At least for now, the thermostats are in fact still available. It's just
that they're not available from Wahler anymore, only from VW (hence the big
price increase, from the prior price of $15 to the current price of nearly
$50).
