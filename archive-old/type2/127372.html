Subject: Finding TDC on a T4 engine

Hey Y'all,
I am used to upright engines, and am helping a friend
with a 1700 pancake, anyway, with the #1 spark plug
out we inserted a long dowel into the cylinder and
turned the engine until it was at what apeared to be
TDC, however, I remember somoene saying that this
piston comes to the top of the cylinders TWICE during
each rotation. So how do I do it is true TDC. Do I
look at the valves and make sure that both #1 valves
are closed???

Peace, John Baker
