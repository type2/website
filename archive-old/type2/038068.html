listees,
ive been roaming around the archives and have been
reading of late about posts pertaining to charlie
fords journey and one post seemed to say something
about his trip info being listed somewhere.   seeing
all this happened before my &quot;vw enlightenment&quot; i was
wondering if anyone can point me in the right
direction to where all his trip reports might be, if
anywhere?   im envious in the posts ive been able to
find so far:)
thanks
shelby
