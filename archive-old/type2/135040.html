Subject: [T2] Oil leakage-push rod tubes

&gt; 1977 Westy, with a bit of a Frankenstein engine...most likely a 1600
&gt; converted to FI...why...who knows,

How sure are you about this?

&gt; problem is thus:  recent valve adjustment has not fixed minor misfiring
&gt; and backfires -

valves would not have anything to do with missfires

&gt;  oil leakage from around the push-rod tubes...such that it drips onto and
&gt; then off of the tin cover plates underneath.  Leakage is from outside ends
&gt; of push rods both left and right.  Is this part of my problem maybe....?

This is common, I would check your valve covers first though. They can leak
esp if you are in and out adj valves and arn't replacing them and or
cleaning them well.

I would like to see a pict of your engine before attempt any diag of your
missfire.

With that missfire is just that, ignition. reaks of timing
