Subject: Distributor and cam timing

Just wondering if there is a way to verify that the cam timing is in synch
with the distributor/crankshaft timing (not sure if I'm using the right
words here).  I'm also wondering if it is possible to put the distributor
drive shaft in wrong (ie forcing me to rotate the distributor so it hits
things on the engine before my timing is right).  I'm looking for more clues
as to why my engine is still running rough/hesitating and without power, and
since I wasn't at the shop when they were building this engine, I'm looking
for things that they could have done wrong before this engine appeared on my
doorstep.  In other news, a failed injector was to blame for running on 3
cylinders.  Now I'm running on 4, but not well.  Things yet to investigate:
CHT sensor and AFM.  Possible vacuum leak in bellows.  (all this on a 2.0L
FI Hydraulic).

Thanks for listening to my confused meanderings,
Niall

P.S.  T-minus 18 hours and counting :-)
