&gt;In response to a question about speed bleeders
&gt;
&gt;Still, I wonder if you could not do all four at once, as 
&gt;long as the receiving jars are big and you
&gt;have a big can of brake fluid.  Any experience out there?

I can't speak from experience since I've always done it manually, but I
think you'd waste a lot of brake fluid trying to do all 4 at once because of
the unequal lengths of the 4 brake lines.  The shortest one would bleed
clear first, but you'd keep pumping fluid through it while trying to get the
longest one to run clear.  I would also suspect that the equalizer (the bit
that keeps the back wheels from locking up before the front ones) would
cause the back lines to not bleed much at all since the fluid would
obviously follow the path of least resistance.  Might get by doing the 2
back ones together and then the 2 front ones together though...
