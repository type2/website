Rick,
there's one thing that will drop oil on the heat exchangers, leaky valve 
cover gaskets and leaky push rod tube gaskets. Perhaps a push rod tube is 
cracked?
If you're going to do the oil pump gasket you may as well do the push rod 
tubes.
if you have the later bus you can leave the heads on and slide em out.
