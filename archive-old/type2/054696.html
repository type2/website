Subject: Tow dollys and busses.

I am to purchase a 78 shortly, only one I've found in PA that was cheap
and nearly rust free. My main problem at this point is it doesn't run,
mostly needing a battery and tlc, since it hasn't run in five years. The
motor has oil in it, but oddly, it hasn't 'peed' on the ground, like I
thought all VW's did. The motor is clean, and the owner, who has had it
since 81, claims she ran fine when parked. The only rust is the front
beam. The uprights that attach it to the body are perforated, but most
material seems to be there, and the beam itself appears fine, with that
serious expection. I, of course, plan on replacing it.

Qu 1: Can the vehicle be towed on a tow dolly, front wheels in the
cradles? Is a buses clearances too risky? The bus rides at a fine
height, no sags.

Qu2: What would be advice on starting this motor, the original 2.0? I
expect the usual, like oil, possibly pumping it up via the oil
pump/drill first, changing gas, cleaning injection (any
recommendations?) new plugs, praying the damn thing has rings still.....

Qu3. Can the upright peices be replaced, without requring a new beam?

My VW experiece is limited to a Bradly GT2 and a 1600 motor, so I am not
intimate with the 2.0 or bus layout, although I plan on it.
Thanks
Al
