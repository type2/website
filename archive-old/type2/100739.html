Subject: Front nose tire cover ??

A very good friend of mine that has had a run of bad luck--But finally after
2 years she has her bus back on the road after a bad accident--
She is in need of the tire cover for the spare on the front of her bus--A
used one will be fine--as she will decorate it to match her bus-- If anyone
can help please P-mail me--hopefully for a Christmas gift--? uj
