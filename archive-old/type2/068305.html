Subject: Re: 12-point tools info: from recent experience

Furthur info on 12 point tools from NAPA:

It's called the &quot;8mm serrated wrench&quot; and is serial no. 2304.  I couldn't
find the 12mm right off but I suspect you don't need it anyway, and even if
you do once you find the 8 you can say &quot;hey, I need this in a 12, too!&quot;
