Subject: Testing Carb diaphragm

Friends suggested looking at the diaphram located under the &quot;No hose
Conn.&quot; portion of this picture.

(2 bl Holley.)
In reading some a novice how-to I believe it's referred to as an
&quot;Accelerator Skirt&quot;
Anyway, I took the 4 screws off and it didn't budge.  Let it sit.

Came back to it tonight and the cover had fallen off, diaphragm and all.
As I don't know the terminology for this (I've put off ordering the
carb book. :-() I don't know what to search for.

The movable walls of the rubber don't appear to be cracked or have
holes, but are wrinkled.  When I expand it (push it out via lever), it
doesn't pop back in.  Should it, or is that the job of internal
pressure?

Is this enough information to justify replacing this part?  Is it
likely the source of my &quot;accelleration flat spot&quot;?
Can I simply screw this back on, or will I need to use a sealant?

Thanks in advance,

Dean
