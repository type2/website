Subject: Re: [T2] Bizarre Failure

I've had that happen on an old type 1 that had the stock vw pulley on 
it.  Have seen others with the problem also.  Basically the pulley works 
loose and then gets forced into the alternator front.  I have only seen 
this happen on two piece pulleys of the original vw type..  The alt 
front is rather soft metal so it chews up real quick.  You will need a 
new alternator and a new pulley as well.

&gt; The

&gt; alternator, and embedded itself into the housing!
&gt;
&gt; Once I got some wrenches in there, I found the rear part of the pulley 
&gt; was
&gt; cracked all the way around, from cutout to cutout, spun right into the
&gt; housing, and took 3 out of 5 front shaft supports to Valhalla with it.
