Subject: Re: [T2] re: cheap muffler

I installed the dual muffler performance muffler from Rocky Mountain Motorworks. $120 way back when. Rust was a big issue. I still have the mufflers as I scrapped the system (still have the pipes in my scrap pile I think) and used the cans for the Corvair implant. PLENTY of aftermarket options. Find one that fits the space and go with a stock spec can  so it is quiet. Asian SUV or minivan - see Mazda or Nissan. 

I liked this RMMW system because the chrome tips are STILL rust free after 6 years, and it was solid. Once upon a time I went through about 3-4 dual quiet pack systems on my Beetle because they fell apart. The tabs welded to the mufflers to hang the mufflers from the pipes would tear out. BAD design. Went to the &quot;High tuck&quot; system and all is well. Different design, much more substantial design-wise.

I prefer to engineer my own and weld my own. Unfortunately I don't have the MIG welder I need (YET)!
