Subject: Re: [T2] Upholstery shops in the Denver, CO area

I would definitely recommend that horsehair (synthetic horsehair??) padding from Wolfsburg West.  You will not be disappointed!  Buy some of it and take it to the upholstery people.  They'll know what to do.  Cheers....KR

one they would recommend?  Were looking to get all of our Westy foam  
done and am also thinking about having the panels done to match.  We  
were looking at SewFine but apparently they just moved to TX.

Peace, Troy
