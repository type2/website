Howdy,

I've had this happen also.  A little gunning of the engine freed it up,
until I went on vacation (flew) and left the bus for two weeks.  Came back
and no go.

I backed off the adjusting screws all the way, and spent about an hour with
a propane torch heating the drum, occasionally smacking it real hard with a
rubber mallet.  

Then I put the wheel gunned it real hard and it broke free.  I then took the
drum off, and half the pad was still on the drum.

Notice that I had no plugs in the inspection holes, which let water in all
the time.  With my current bus (granted it is still down, just the axles and
two pieces of tin left:) I have all the appropriate plugs and it has never
happened.  Same weather, driving habits, terrain, etc.
