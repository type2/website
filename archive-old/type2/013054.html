Sorry,

I just want to maximize safety in our vehicle is all.

Bottom line is &quot;don't drive fast&quot;. But I can't avoid the other guy.

I can see my  children being hurt even by a fast braking, so I 
wanted to check it out.

Since the vehicle was made without them, it will pass a safety 
without them here in CANADA

Cheers,
