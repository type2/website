If you will look at the fan hub you will see that there are three ears
with threaded holes for the bolts. Between two of these ears is a smaller
ear which should have a locator pin in it. Now look at the mating face of
the fan.  Do you see the hole the locator pin goes in?

Remember the washer or air conditioner pulley between the hub and fan or
you will lock your engine right up!

                             OOK!
