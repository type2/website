&gt;&gt;I thought it worth mentioning since gauge mounting in Vanagons have 
&gt;&gt;limited space for additional gauges. &lt;&lt;

I have never been inside a Vanagon, so I'm not sure if this will work on 
one's dash, but I really like the three-gauge pod that Bus Boys sells.  I 
mounted it &quot;up-side-down&quot; on the top of my 68's dash with double sideded 
tape.  I have oil temp, oil temp and oil pressure in this pod.  Now that I 
can see that both temp senders are consistent and I only need to monitor 
one, I'm gonna change one of those pod holes to CHT.  They also sell two and 
one pod versions.
