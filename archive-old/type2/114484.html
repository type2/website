Subject: RE: [VB] Battery danger

I have seen that happen when a spark ignited the hydrogen gas trapped in
the not so well ventilated space. I have also seen batteries explode
when the jumpers were hooked up backwards. 7 out of 10 times it will
take out the VR or alt first, but there is also that rare chance.

   If you think this is phooey, extremely rare, or a
nearly non-exist phenomenon that only happens in labs
etc. YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN. My  brother had a battery
blow up in his face when he was about 17 and was lucky
