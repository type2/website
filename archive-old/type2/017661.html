Bob,

Not VW specific but on most PCV valves that I have seen, the purpose of the
valve is to keep a backfire from igniting the oil vapors in the crankcase. 
Ergo, it's a one-way valve.  Vapor can move from the crankcase to the intake
but not vice-versa.

AND...

I'm told that leaking under the cork gasket is not at all uncommon.  I replace
mine yearly just to preclude the problem.
