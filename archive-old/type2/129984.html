&gt;&gt; I also have identified the need for a new passenger (us) side tail light

&gt;&gt; Also wondering if the assembly 211945231 available from BD
&gt;&gt; comes with this cover?
&gt;No. I think you can get the cap through the dealer but the cost is
&gt;outrageous.

For whatever it's worth, I picked up a new pair of made-in-Taiwan EMPI 
taillight assemblies off of Ebay, and they came with the inside covers.  
It was a cheap way to get non-broken lenses, lens seals and inside 
covers .. and that's about all they're good for, the actual taillight piece
with the bulbholders is junk -- doesn't hold bulbs very well, and won't
fit the Bus without some filing or whittling.
