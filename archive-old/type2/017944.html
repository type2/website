   What I'm going to do with my diesel conversion in my '73 is use two
small radiators w/fans and put them in the rear airscoops, instead of
running them up to the front and cutting out the nose. Somebody else put
one on top and built a scoop, but I figure you can just use a Y-pipe and
two smaller radiators in the stock airscoops. Maybe bike radiators or
some of the better quality oil coolers, etc., something fairly long and
narrow.
