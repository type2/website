&gt; I'm wondering if we shouldn't get the Steven Dolan money together and buy
&gt; Joe a motor. Anyone got a really sweet singleport turnkey we could ship
&gt; him for under a grand? :)

I think that's a *damn* fine idea, Jack, and I love you, man.

Fiddled with the engine a little tonite but my bro-in-law's got the 
floor jack so I didn't bother trying to pull it.  

But confirmed:

- engine turns 1-3 degrees and goes clunk against something in 
either direction.  Otherwise it appears that maybe it's not seizing -- 
this is not the stiffness it had last time around.  Maybe it's not even 
inside the case.

- starter was toast. :-(  More specifically, solenoid non respondo.  
Added to my pile of dead starters.

Decided not to fry my one remaining live starter just yet, so I 
goofed around elsewhere with the electrical system.  Got the rear 
interior two-switch light installed and working, tracked down a 
pesky fault in the driver's door switch that prevented front interior 
light from operating with the doors (now it does and it feels like 
decadent luxury vs. my old '68 westy with no door switches at all), 
got right front parking lite going (lens full of water!), got license light 
working.  Many wins, as they say - simple tasks to make me feel 
better amid the engine foolishness.

Of the lights, only the rear side marker and reverse lites remain to 
be fixed.  I was telling my wife about my wiring successes and she 
said, in her inimitable way, &quot;Doesn't do much good on a car that 
won't drive, does it?&quot;  (She just says things like that to encourage 
me.)  

Sure, but it makes it seem a little more real to have the blinkers 
work (ahh- 12V!) or sit in the back and read the wiring diagram by 
the cabin light.  When I bought this thing it was inert metal 
sculpture.  Now it's metal sculpture that can get a short, catch fire, 
and burn up.

I'm starting to get excited about camping in this bus.  'Ware, wife.

C'mon, engine.  Fix thyself.  The road beckons.
