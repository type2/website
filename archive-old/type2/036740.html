Subject: Re: gasoline

So, what's the deal with high octane gas?  I had a '68 and the guy told me to
put in 92 and I did, but then me and my dad decided that that wasn't
necessary.  We figured it never had anything that high in '68, why does it
need it now?

    I'm driving a '77 now, and I put regular (87?) in it.  It seems to run
ok.  Am I missing out on power or something?  What should I be putting in it,
and why?

&gt; Chevron Techron 92 was the cat's meow.
