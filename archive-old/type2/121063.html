Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Oil on Concrete Garage Floor

If on concrete, I cover the spill with flour, then a layer or 2 of
newspaper so you can walk on it.  If you see the oil stain the top of
the flour, reapply more flour. Sweep/vac up a few days later. The stain
will come up well sprayed with GumOut carb cleaner or doused with
acetone and wiped up with a rag.  The acetone will dry very fast; paint
thinner tends to leave a slippery film for a while.  If on blacktop
(which we have also) use the flour, vac it up well, then use a
detergenty like 409.
