&lt;&lt; Re: Pulling Gas Tank (??)

  &gt;&gt;
Hello all,
                 As I am installing my gas tank as we speak so I will give 
this one a shot. It works better without the engine in the bus but I have 
heard a roommer it is possible with the engine still in place with the buses 
with the type 4 motor. First order of business is to unhook the fuel line 
from under the tank from your carbs or F. I.  In mine the F. I.  has been 
replaced with a 2 bl Webber. Block the line off or if the tank is empty just 
note how it attaches to the bottom of the tank and remove it. Next remove the 
gas cap and you should see a rubber elbow attached beneath a metal ring held 
down with 4 screws. disconnect the ring and on the other side of the panel 
this elbow is connected to a pipe that has a bend in it and runs down to the 
filler neck hose. Check this piece very carefully for cracks especially if 
you have been smelling gas fumes. It might be better not to disturb it too 
much as this part is very hard to find.( just a warning).Follow the pipe on 
down to the filler neck hose and remove the clamp holding this on and remove 
it. To gain access to all of this remove the black metal pancake disc that is 
mounted into the right side of the engine compartment and the panel just 
behind the engine that is held in by 6 or 8 screws. you will know it when you 
see it. Also it helped me to remove the top of the engine compartment lid for 
access.Now you will have to remove the two straps holding the tank in. The 
bolts for these are under the bus as you look up exactly where they are 
attached. You will see them quickly. Also you will need to remove the sending 
unit wires (2) One hot and one ground. Disconnect the battery first as a 
spark would be a disaster if gas were in the tank. and the vent connections. 
There are I believe three tubes connecting the vents in the compartment just 
above the tank and attached to the tank. Remember how all this goes back 
together for reassembly. I often take notes and draw pictures to help as it 
may be some time before I can get back to a project. It is important to note 
any rubber pieces under the tank holding it in place and their location. Also 
mine had a bunch of felt strips glued to it. These help hold the tank in 
place. You will have to pull up on the tank in order for it to clear with the 
tubes coming out of the bottom. It should be a matter of wiggling it out from 
there. A P.O. had cleverly cut a square section out of the engine compartment 
top right above the sending unit and siliconed it back in. Makes it a snap to 
change the sending unit without removing the tank. A MAJOR word of caution 
here. I am having a very hard time finding the rubber elbow that attaches 
just beneath the gas cap and also the fillerneck elbow that attaches to the 
fuel tank. So be forewarned if these parts are worn out on your bus they are 
difficult if not impossible to find. I am still looking for these two pieces 
if anyone knows of these for sale.
