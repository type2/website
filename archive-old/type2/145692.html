&gt; Based on the assumption that these MexiMotors have domed pistons and

&gt; grades of gas...

Actually, dished pistons would be low compression.

&gt; This engine does not have the power that my previous one had.
&gt; Thatistosay, Lurch does not climb the hills the way he/she/it used to.

Matches my experience.

&gt; I guess the trade-off is longevity of the engine.  I THINK it runs
&gt; cooler, but I still don't have enough miles on it to make an accurate
&gt; assessment in that regard.  I've been watching CHT and oil temp.

I don't know about longevity.  It certainly is nice not to have any ping,
even on a hot day climbing hills at large throttle openings.

&gt; My mileage (MPG) has dropped off (from about 18.5 MPG to 17 MPG).  I'm
&gt; guessing it is because I'm having to be more aggressive with the
&gt; accelerator pedal in order to compensate for the decreased power.

My experience too.  Lower compression means lower volumetric efficiency.

&gt; I am now using a SVDA distributor instead of a 009, but I am not seeing
&gt; the benefits that many people claim (better gas mileage, cooler
&gt; running).

I didn't see any difference either.  I did see a big difference in
drivability, though, which makes the SVDA distributor worth it.

&gt; My opinion is that this is not an upgrade from a rebuild, but I'm
&gt; hoping time will prove me wrong.

Having _all_ the parts be new is definitely a plus.  If I wanted to build
a higher compression engine, I'd start with a Meximotor and replace the
pistons for higher compression.

Higher compression might be a good idea these days.  The price difference
between regular and premium has remained about 20 cents even with the
overall price doubling.  It might be more economical to build an engine
with higher compression that gets better mileage even if it requires 92
octane.
