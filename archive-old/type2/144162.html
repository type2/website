Subject: Re: [T2] Jacking points 

Side thread:  Anyone here ever built (dug) what
I know to call a grease pit, i.e., a hole in
the ground over which you drive a vehicle for
service?

We're on a farm here, and I'm thinking of doing
this soonish.  The bus would be one use, but
we have a bunch of others.  I'm assuming that
this is simple, but it never hurts to ask for
advice...
