&gt; After a couple of hours of fiddling with it I Managed to get it running most 
&gt; respectably. It was TOTALLY dry and all of it's problems were due to a bad 
&gt; installation and an installer that compensated for a basic problem[out of 
&gt; calibration decel valve causing a huge vacuum leak] by turning screws and 
&gt; changing the timing etc.
&gt; With the overly lean mixture, Too tight valve clearances,and the timing the 
&gt; way it was this engine was a good cantidate for an explosion. Doubtless it 
&gt; would have been blamed on GEX.

The GEX engine I had was also relatively dry and ran quite well. The
problem was that it ran well for less than 40K miles in a
well-maintained bug.

Bob Hoover (I think) explained it rather well.  The typical aircooled VW
changes hands every one to two years.  It would not be smart for crate
rebuilders to produce an engine that would last much longer than this,
because it would cut their sales to subsequent owners.
