Subject: Re: CDI noise

Bucket, I Truly hope you are kidding. If not, then no offense  intended, but 
you are a complete Idiot. The Tiger CDI works two ways. If the plug is 
inserted with the arrow pointed to the word CDI, then you are running on the 
CDI. If you reverse it, then you are back to normal ingition( fail safe, in 
case anything goes wrong with the CDI.). Please tell me you were kidding in 
your previous post. This is clearly listed in the instructions that come with 
the Universal CDI. If you are not kidding, well then, please don't respond to 
any other posts. You are obviously not capable of reading instructions, and 
are passing along totally bogus advice...Sorry to sound so pissed off, but 
the last thing a new type2 owner needs is advice from someone who has not a 
clue.
