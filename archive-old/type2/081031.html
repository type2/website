&gt; &gt; Saw this ad and thought I would share it with you.  It is the front
&gt; &gt; end of a 78 Rabbit and the back end of a 72 Bus.  It looks like
&gt; &gt; someone did a nice job on it.  It's not mine and I do not know
&gt; &gt; anything about it.

&gt; Yes, of course, it's an abomination and merely viewing it will condemn you
&gt; to an eternity of driving Chrysler minivans, but....
&gt;
&gt; Did everyone notice the mods that were done to the jalousie windows???  I
&gt; rate it as being as pointless as the rest of the conversion[1], but was
&gt; fascinated by that more thna the graft.
