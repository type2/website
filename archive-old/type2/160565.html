&gt;I've just managed to find myself an old VDO tachometer for my '71 Bus ;-).
&gt;It has what I think is a part number on the back: 230/98/1.  There are three
&gt;terminals on the back (and one &quot;blank&quot; terminal).  What do I connect them
&gt;to?  One must connect to the coil, one to ground, and one to a positive
&gt;supply I think.  From left to right, the terminals are labelled &quot;-12&quot;, (the
&gt;blanked one is labelled &quot;6&quot;), &quot;15&quot; and &quot;+&quot;.

I'm not sure about that one but the old style tachs, when looking at the back of the tach and the horizontal pins were 4-3-2-1, then the wiring was:

4 - Terminal 1 on coil
3 - GND
2 - 12V
1 - leave unused
