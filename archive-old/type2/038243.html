Subject: Everybus and the#4 spark plug

Well Gunthor has new spark plug wires, the valves have been adjusted, a
compression test was done and the spark plugs were cleaned and regapped.
Everything is running pretty smoothly. He still has a slight missing
sound when running at speed but seems to be fine at idle. Anyhow I'm
sure he'll make it to Everybus with no problem. Everything is packed in
real tight and ready to go. It's amazing how much you need to take to
camp. Especially when your bus isn't a camper.

We're off to see the wizard! See ya at Everybus 2000

Thanks for everyones help!

Sharon
