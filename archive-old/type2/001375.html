Subject: Dang!!  Power Brake Booster Req'd!

Hi Folks,

I have a 73 westy with 113000 miles on it.

Drove to work last night, and everything worked just fine.

Drove out the parking lot this morning on the way home, and the power brakes
were power-less.

It stops fine, if you push with both feet, but I can't make the tires lock
up. I can hear a slight whooshing sound as the pedal swiftly descends 2/3 of
the way to the floor before braking starts. Very unnerving in the morning
traffic.

I checked the vaccuum line at the booster, and there *is* plenty of vaccuum.
My mechanic says the last time he did one of these that booster was
expensive, and will probably be hard to get, as well. Actually I just
checked with the local dealer, and he says the part is about $500cdn. On top
of that, the increasing volume of sound from the back end says we need new
heater boxes as well. Oh bliss.

We were starting to shop for a more &quot;conventional&quot; mini-van or sport-ute to
take the pressure off the poor beast for the winter, now it appears we may
have to move up that purchase. I guess I'll jus have to wait to do the
repairs in the springtime, after I get the Christmas bills paid down.

If anyone has a lead on replacement parts for heater boxes and brake
boosters for a 73 westy in the Toronto area, this would be a good time to
let me know.
