&gt; Hello Volk
&gt; Im looking for a plan to make an adaptor plate plan for Golf/Jetta
&gt; Engine to be done at a shop in my area
&gt;
&gt; Since this plate has been produce for over 20 year, im sure its
&gt; possible
&gt; to find a plan or programm for CNC machined!!

There isn't much chance that having it made will be cheaper than buying it
unless you own the CNC machinery yourself.

Go with the ready-made solution from KEP. Yes, they have been doing them for
20 years and that is why you want to use their product, they have already
made all the mistakes that you are about to make if you try to do it
yourself.
