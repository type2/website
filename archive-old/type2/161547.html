Subject: Re: [T2] Cam Question

Arnaud, all the push rods are the same length; none are bent as they all 
roll evenly. When everything is in place, however, it's as if the rod is too 
short.

I pull the head, and when I look at the lifters in the block, the exhaust 
side recedes into the block about 1/4 inch behind the intake side. What 
you're saying is that they don't touch the lobe when in that position. It 
seems that they should be even in order to push the rods into the correct 
position to adjust the valve....

The valves are closed when adjusting at TDC. The adjustment screw is all the 
way in...but... too loose a valve to run properly.

The valves are all seated properly. Bolts torqued according to the sequence 
in Bently.

Jamie, is there a way to pull the lifters out of the block? I tried with a 
magnet, buit they won't come all the way out. Then I can measure the cam 
lobes, right?

&quot;the adjusting screw way in on the rocker arm and it won't contact the valve 
head....? &quot; That's it.

It's pre hydraulic valves-'76'.....

The valves and the head are fine. What I'm seeing is that the lifters aren't 
even when at TDC. Aren't the valves supposed to be both closed at that 
point? So the lifters should be even in the shaft?


Thanks guys!!
