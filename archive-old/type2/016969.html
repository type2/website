Subject: Weber 32/34 &amp; Type 4

Three points:

1.  On the type 4 engine, this carb is supposed to get larger idle jets
to help prevent hesitation coming off idle.  The 1600 setting is 50 and
60.  My Weber came with a 70 to replace the 60, and then you put the 60
where the 50 is.

2.  I found that my stock vac/mech advance distributor had such a long
advance curve that setting the top of the range to between 28 and 32
degrees had it retarded too much at idle.  I disconnected the vac
advance hose (plugged it on carb) and that way its got some advance
already at idle.

3.  The symptom you describe can occur on the PICT equiped 1600s also,
if the heat riser is blocked.  The problem is worse when it's cold,
right?  You have those long cold intake runners and no heat riser.  I
have been meaning to figure out a different air filter arrangement that
would allow me to draw hot air from under the cylinders, like on the
stock 1600s (the stock dual carbs get heat through their short
manifolds).

4.  There should be two fulcrums for the accelerator pump.  You could
try switching to get more or less gas, to see if that helps.
