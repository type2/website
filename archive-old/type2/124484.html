Subject: Re: [T2] Auto Paint at G.I.Joes. How bad is it? 

After painted my '65 Bug (very first time) then my '77 Westy with pretty
good results (a professional painter who painted a few of my friends cars,
said so) I found that the problem is &quot;surface preparation&quot;, no matter what
kind of paint do you spay on it, a bad surface means a bad paint job.
I do not recomend do the job twice but if you want to do this way, I suggest
to you to lead your efforts in the preparation, ask around how to, talk with
friends and go to shops and see then working.  I am sure if you do that way
you gonna let your first paint job more that a year, well if you finally
like the color scheme.

Greetings from the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela
