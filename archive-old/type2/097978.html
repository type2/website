&gt; Oil ratings work like this:
&gt;
&gt; SAE            - test standard of the Society of Automotive Engineers
&gt; first number   - viscosity at room temperature
&gt; W (if present) - winter rated (viscosity index has been modified so that
&gt;                  it thickens less at low temps)
&gt; second number  - viscosity at high temperature (200F, I believe)

The way I was taught this was:

The designation ending in &quot;W&quot; gives you a viscosity range at low
temperature (something like -30C) on a standard (ASTM D5293) testing
machine.

The designation not ending in &quot;W&quot; gives you a viscosity range at high
temperature (something like 100C) on a different standard (ASTM D445)
testing machine.

The two numbers are simply designators, not actual measurements, and they
cannot be compared to each other.

Oils with a &quot;W&quot; designation usually have viscosity modifiers that give
them a flatter viscosity/temperature curve, but this isn't always the
case.
