&gt; My husband and I have had a running argument on this subject for years. He
&gt; thinks the '82 aircooled Vanagon should sit and &quot;warm up&quot; after being turned
&gt; on. I always turn it on and take off immediately, as suggested in the
&gt; handbook. (Since it's mine I win anyway. &lt;g&gt;) Any comments?

My opinion is that you should warm it up for at least a couple of 
minutes, especially in the winter time.  Or drive it gently (ie, not 
running the revs up very high, or fast) until it reaches operating temp. 
I am assuming yours is an '82 based on your e-mail address, thus it is 
aircooled.  These beasts need to be warmed up even in the summer time. 

Just my $.02
