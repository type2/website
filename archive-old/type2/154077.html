Subject: RE: [T2] Bugpack Header and Single Quiet Pack Combo for 77?

Courtney,

I hate talk smack, but honestly Bugpack and Empi replacement mufflers are
crap. I think the lower price is a result of having them made of pre-rusted
steel. Now I haven't used the type4 mufflers, but my 68-71 muffler(s) rusted
faster than a kid's-BBgun-left-in-the-rain.

From what I have heard, using the VWC-071-251-053-PS is pretty decent but
having a muffler shop weld one up is much better in the long run. Oooo, they
could even do a stainless one, or titanium or.... wait, that doesn't save
money!
