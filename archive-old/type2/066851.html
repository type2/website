Pat Walsh sez:

&gt;My dream trip would probably be driving the old Route 66, from Chicago to
&gt;LA.  I got the 66th anniversary Route 66 map from Rand McNally a few years
&gt;ago but staring at it now and then is about as close as I've gotten so far.

I also have a huge old air control map from the 70's pinned to my
wall. I like to check out where listies live or other domestic
places I situations. (I have the map becuase it is the only map
I could find that had NO political boundaries on it. Try to find one.)

But, I have a cure for my 'vanderlust'. I am driving to Sandy Eggo
next summer to hook up with the Baja-Bound listies. I am planning
a minimum of a week from Washington, DC to Sandy Eggo. I am thinking
of taking the Northern route, it being the middle of the summer,
and route 66 is a good choice for much of the way. I am not
an interstate driver, unless I can help it. I may take more
time, if the job and moolah allows it. Two weeks in Baja, 
and more time home, either back through SD or up through
the Mexican mainland. (hot, hot, hot!)

So, if you live east of the 'ol Miss., or want to hook up
along the way, why dont you plant to take from a couple of days to
a month to travel with me? (us??) Strength in numbers!

And I dont even have one of those fancy-schmancy 'Westies'. Just a 
7 passenger bus with some 'custom' modifications.
