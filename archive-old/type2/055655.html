Subject: tents, campers.....

We have a '65 Westy walk-thru, and a '77 Westy, with no stove and an
ice-chest. The '77 has a wonderfully comfortable bed, and it is really nice
not having to un-make the bed, or fold things up when yo uleave camp.
Almost like having two rooms, and the view up there is wonderful too. The
'65 has style, the bed is small, the damn tire in the way, but with the
tent attached [we have a drive-away big-top tent], the Coleman kitchen set
up in the tent, the kerosene lamp lit.....it doesn't get much better than
that.

But the secret to the tent is that the doors with all the shelves fold
right into the tent. Makes it really handy, and aftermarket walmart tent
won't have that feature, and then yo might as well just be camping in a
tent, which isn't bad mind you.  The Westy tent is really better.

So go with the '77 if you like comfort, or a '65 if you like style.....

Jim
