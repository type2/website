Subject: Re: [T2] Double Jointed Rear axles??

&gt; I am getting ready to do my first engine pull ever on my 71 Type II. I am
&gt; using the Muir book as a guide, and the book says give some information on
&gt; how to support the transmisson if you have double jointed rear axles. I can
&gt; see from the book that the double jointed rear axles were introduced in 68.
&gt; Does the 71 have them too?

yes.
my favorite way to support the tranny is with a length of chain and a
couple of s hooks or small turnbuckles.
i support the engine on a floor jack and unbolt the rear support.
then i lift the engine up a few inches.
then i slide under and support the tranny with the chain looped around the
frame rails. there is a spot on either side convenient to loop through.
then once the engine is out the bus can roll if needed.
