The floors are beautiful!

Solid body no motor, needs a home. no title. asking
$500obo. must go this week, or we will get fined if it's still here. located in Tuckahoe ny

Call (914) 337-6100 anytime I'm usually here at the shop 7:00-11:00pm m-f and 9:00-6:30 on sat. We are on the AIRS list, so if you need any help, please call me. 
 
act quickly before it goes to the boneyard 
(I would if I could, but I already have a Diesel Vanagon in my parents driveway, and a 88 GL is going there next week to be converted to a 1.8 or 2.0(whatever I find first goes in it).
