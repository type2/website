Subject: i will photograph poptop conversion
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

judging by the big response, i will be photographing everything i do for my
poptop conversion. i'll also be painting the top of my poptop, getting out
all the dents (only a few) on the bus itself and giving it a whole new
paintjob as well as putting in new rubber window seals. lets see, what else!
pretty much photo-ing anything related to the poptop. from simple stuff as
installing the poptop canvas to welding the suppports and so on! should be
pretty fun. i am going this weekend to the junkyard to pick up the cut off
roof i took the poptop off of. i feel this will be really important and save
loads of time planning the wholes and supports. by the time i am done, i'll
be able to give you dimensions, etc if you dont have the roof yourself to
measure from.

give me about a month or so till you start seeing pictures (i'm already take
a couple pics) becuase i just had a dual carb rebuild done and i am short on
the cash flow now :) ohh, if your wondering, my bus is running the best it
has ever run since buying it! i'm glad i had them rebuilt.

regards, dave
