Subject: Re: [T2] Emblems

From: &lt;fatmedia_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I found front emblems on Bus boys,
&gt; http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/emblems.htm
&gt; and on Bus Depot
&gt; http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=241853601B
&gt; Bus Depot also has a blue and white VW sign that is about 11&quot; across.

After looking through both sites to compare prices, there might be a market
for resin repro's.  If and when I find the three emblems (up to '67, '68 to
'72, and '73 to '79), I'll give repro'ing them a whirl.  Well five if you
include the vanagons ('80 to '88 and '89 to '91), but there might not be a
strong market for the vanagon ones.

Figure $25.00, plus shipping.  They could be 1. Ready for priming or
chroming, 2. Bronze, 3. Silver, 4. Gold, 5. Copper, and 6. Gun metal.
