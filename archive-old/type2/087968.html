Well, I'm off on the first high mileage trip with the rebuilt heads on =
my 82 Vanagon Westy.  I'm getting on I-44 at Springfield, MO and going =
through Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Chickasha, and Lawton.  From there I'm =
heading West on 62 to Altus where I'll take 6 North to Quartz Mountain =
State Park. =20

If you see me, be sure to honk and wave!!  My Westy is light blue and =
I'll be towing a red trailer with a white Vespa scooter on the back.  =
I've got the names and numbers from the AIRS list.  Hopefully I won't =
need them!!

I'll be returning Sunday afternoon.

Thanks,
Erich Elmer
