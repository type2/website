Exactly!!! Use That DTM, I have 3 of them on my personal engines, and live
by the design..It is a truly wonderful piece, that is designed and hand made
by a man whom I respect more than anyone in the VW industry...You will not
be sorry..

&gt; I don't know how truthful that LAST comment was, but 1)I don't need
&gt; anything from Kennedy.  I have a '79 transmission in the bus. 2)Cutting,
&gt; what cutting? I intend to use one of these: www.spiretech_dot_com/~opshroud 3)
&gt; While we're at it, I'm planning on a 2.2 or a 2.6 litre.  That's why I
&gt; wouldn't opt for the 1.9L type1.

&gt; One good reason is that Bernie Bergman motors are crap.
&gt;
&gt; Except the ones painted red.

&gt; &gt; well, if it was a 72 up, you wouldn't have to cut all
&gt; &gt; that metal out of the rear, and then get a KEP
&gt; &gt; flywheel, and then you only have a 1.7 or 1.8L engine
&gt; &gt; stock, why not get Bernie Bergmann to build you a
&gt; &gt; nicely balanced 1.9L type 1 engine and save the bus,
&gt; &gt; or just get the later model bus w/2.0L already there -
&gt; &gt; makes sense $wise - yes or no
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
