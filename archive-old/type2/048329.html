Subject: Re: [T2] 3 things around the turn signal

&gt; Anybody have advice on how to fix this. I checked the archives but
&gt; didn't find much that was helpfull.

I had a washer hose rupture under my dash shortly after I got my bus.
Yuck! The mechanic cut the hose where it was broken and spliced it back
together by inserting a small plastic tube snagged from another engine
-- vacuum line? -- between the two cut ends, and butting the cut ends
together over it.
