Subject: Re: Engine modifications


&gt;Edmonton, Alberta Canada, and I paln to do alot of camping/driving in
&gt;the rocky mountains where the hills can often be steep and long.

&gt;the average cruise speed on our hwy's is approx.
&gt;70-75 mph on flat land and usually 50-60 mph in the mountains.  What
&gt;type of engine modifications would you suggest, or resouces to access.

In the nicest possible way: get a Ford. You cannot possibly expect a bus to
take the Canadian Rockies at a minimum of 50-60. Either learn to deal with
the consternation of your fellow travelers in a serene way, or get
something stronger, because as things sit a bus is not for you.
