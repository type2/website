Thanks to all who replied.

I replaced and checked things in this order: valves, plugs,
plug wires (one at a time test, not replaced), swapped carb,
cleaned air cleaner and added new oil, replaced condenser.  
Still ran rough.

So I then bought new distributor cap, plug wires, and rotor. 
Runs fine now.

Moral is, after replacing the obvious, if it still runs rough, 
replace everything else too.
