&gt;
&gt;Showing your location in your sig is a good idea.  It would also help if 
&gt;people would pare their signatures down to only a few lines, so those that 
&gt;receive the digests will not have to scroll through them so many times.

Hopefully my revised signature is more acceptable, if not, I'll delete it 
entirely.
