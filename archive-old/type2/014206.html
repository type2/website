Subject: Re: [T2] whomp whomp...



&gt; actually...i did also replace the steering dampener.
&gt; 
&gt; the tires are yokohama 356 185R14 load D's...with only
&gt; 400 miles on them.
&gt; 
&gt; like i said, they only put a balancing weight on the
&gt; inside and not on the outside, eventhough the other
&gt; ones have weights on the outside.

Sometimes this is normal.  The wheels are balanced radially and for wobble.  Most of the time you end up with weights on both the inside 
and outside of the rim, but not always the same weight.

If a tire requires a lot of weight to balance, I'll ask the tire man to turn it 180 degrees on the rim, which usually allows balancing with fewer 
weights.  A couple of times I've asked for a different tire when turning it didn't reduce the need for weights.  I like the tires to be reasonably 
balanced initially, as they wear more evenly and stay in balance longer.

Good tires used to have a spot on the sidewall on the heavy side of the tire, which you would match up with the light side of your rim (if 
you knew where it was).  Not seen too often these days.

&gt; i'll put the wheel off in the morning and check the
&gt; cotter pin.  the noise is loud enough to worry me that
&gt; its more than that.
