&gt; So I start my bus up and i notice this tapping sound comeing from

&gt; bit of gas), but the taping sound is much louder at the higher rev.

From my experience the taping in the engine is a lot of times
something in the valve trane. Could be other stuff, but let's
eliminate the easy stuff first. You need to correctly adjust the
valves in the engine, both bentley &amp; muir cover this as well as in the
library here: http://type2_dot_com/bartnik/valveadj.htm but do note this
is a for a type1 engine. Process is the same but some of the things
are different.

&gt; Loose valves and Timing off??? Am I right? Also, a 72 bus has an
&gt; alternator of a generator??

according to this http://type2_dot_com/library/identifi/modvar.htm the 72
was the first bus to include a alternator. Which makes sence because
of the resesign of the engine layout.

&gt; And while Im on the subject, Whats the difference between the two?
&gt; Alright, thats it for now. Thanks

this site covers the difference pretty darn well:
