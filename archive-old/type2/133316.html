&gt; I'm new to the list, currently looking for a bus between 1977-1979.

good years, I think 78 is the best but.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 1.) How available are the automatic transmissions to fit these
&gt; models/years? If I get a manual transmission, and
&gt; want to convert it, will I be able to find an automatic trans and about
&gt; how much will it cost me ?

less than 10% were auto trannys and while the auto tranny is ok it is no
where near as strong as the manual, also gets a little less fuel mileage.

that said if you drive in the city like I do they can be very handy.
converting between manual and auto trannys on a bus is a very difficult
job, search for the model you want.

auto trannys can be found but are not as plentiful or as cheap as the
manuals.   they cost aboutt $1,000 to have one professionally rebuilt and
there are only a couple people I would trust to do it.
