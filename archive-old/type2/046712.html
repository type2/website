Subject: re: low oil pressure at low speeds

Said Al Brase:

&gt; I'm with Clara that an oil pressure gauge would be nice, but the ideal
&gt; &quot;baling wire&quot; fix is 20w-50 oil. I've even used 60-70 Harley oil in a
&gt; worn out American truck.

Alas, I've got 20W-50 in there now.  Perhaps there was still some of the
diluted oil left over.  I'm looking for higher viscosity now.  Used to
run straight 40W in south Florida in my 65 Beetle.  Is there such thing
as 50W?  And this Harley oil -- available widely?  Maybe I should use
90W tranny oil. ;-)

&gt; I'd also rather  see that the light is winking at me at every stop light
&gt; than listen to it revving too fast (and burning a LOT of petrol) at
&gt; idle.

It ain't winking - it's staring at me, one-eyed and threatening, like
Odin.  But again, it might not be accurate.  Gauging will tell.

Then said Mike Dwyer:

&gt; Second:  Switch to 40 wt oil and let it warm up a bit.  (Use a block heater?)

Warmitup might be needed in winter, but the way it's been around here
(FL) this summer it's hard for me to even take that seriously. :-)

&gt; Drive very carefully and easily, staying close to home while you build a
&gt; replacement engine.

Ultimately the solution I'll go for.

Again, thanks for the suggestions!
