&gt; &gt; Funny how we cringe at the thought of yahoos lowering their busses or

&gt; running around in daily heavy city traffic with their
&gt; right sides unharmed might be able to tell you something.

??? never thought of this as a problem but then I paid my way through
college driving a bus (not the VW kind) and never even use the inside van
mirror except to keep an eye on the kids.  even got tired of having my
stuff and tools exposed that I have covered the rear windows with
translucent film.
  but then my other bus for many years was a &quot;TC-31 Twin Coach&quot; but that
is another list, you think restoring a Type 2 is expensive and hard to
find parts for!?!?!?
