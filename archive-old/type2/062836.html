Subject: Refinishing fiberglass top

The fiberglass top on my 79 Westy is at the fuzzy stage - not delaminated
yet.
Any advice?

Here's what has transpired so far:

Friday I made the runs to two local paint dealers in Ukiah.  After reading
about marine paint here on the list, I asked about the advisability - the
first store
said  to use epoxy paint instead (you get to mix two parts and spread with
a roller). $70/gal for epoxy paint.

At the other store, they suggested industrial enamel.  I asked about
epoxy paint...they said not to use - it is inflexible and over fiberglass
it would 
crack.  The industrial enamel didn't look too sharp - one guy at the store
had
painted his Nissan pickup with it.  At this point another person stepped in
and said to use gelcoat, as it is designed for fiberglass, but suggested I
speak 
with the experts at their competitor's - the first store I went to, of
course... ;) 

Now that I am full circle, anyone actually done this, and with some long
term
success?
