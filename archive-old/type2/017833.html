&gt; Funny... I just a what sounds like a similar run-in.  Got a nastygram from
&gt; the city telling me that my bus was a &quot;visual blight&quot; -- shows how little
&gt; they know!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow, long story short, decided to but it back on the road, too.  Had it
&gt; towed to local VW shop, he got it running but discovered that it won't pass
&gt; emissions, low compression on one cylinder.  So, drove it home last night
&gt; (yeah!), stalled out once I left the freeway (sigh!), but nursed it home.
&gt; 
&gt; Called emissions folks, talked to a fellow who had driven a '64 camper from
&gt; Turkey to Kashmir in his youth.  Very sympathetic in trying to find a way to
&gt; help me weasel out of the emissions requirements, but in the end, nothing
&gt; for it.
&gt; 
&gt; So!  I am faced with my first engine rebuild.  For that matter, first engine
&gt; removal.  Eeek!  Muir in hand, but it makes me feel shaky anyway.  Looking
&gt; to start in on it later this summer (wife &amp; I are taking some
&gt; maternity/paternity leave late June...).
&gt; 
&gt; '72 412 1700 FI, or so I'm told.  The '72, Type IV, and FI I can vouch for.
&gt; Automatic tranny, Westfalia conversion.  Named &quot;Entropy,&quot; as I've put more
&gt; miles on it trailered than under its own power (about 3-to-1 ratio :-/).
&gt; Wife's been very tolerant.
&gt; 
&gt; Question: I know that Muir's book says to label everything you pull off --
&gt; but with what kind of tape???  Between grease and dirt, everything I've
&gt; tried just falls off.  The main thing that terrifies me about doing this is
&gt; the prospect of not being able to piece it together again.  I know it's a
&gt; silly thing, but I'm really curious.  Do you gurus just *know* what hooks up
&gt; where?  Or do you have some special super-sticky tape?  Or is my engine
&gt; compartment just unconscionably filthy?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance -- glad to be back on list!

Lars:
A few suggestions:
1. Take a few photos. A good old time non auto focus camera with a
flash, stop the lens way down and set the focus at minimum. EVERYTHING 
will be in focus! I once did this with a Porsche 911 and you could read
the part numbers on the wire harness! Make a few different exposures and
angles to make sure every thing shows and put a piece of white paper
behind things to hilite them. Photos are cheap compared to time.
2. Use White vinyl electricians coding tape, write in ball-point pen,
tape around the wire and stick it to itself like a flag. Stretch the
tape a little so the tape is tight on the wire.
3. Don't worry too much. Many people on this list can talk you through
this, that's the easy part.
4. Draw a few sketches to remember which bolts go where, etc.
