Subject: RE: [T2] Need part number for 050 rotor and cap

&gt; Just installed my new(used) 050 mechanical advance dizzy, but did not
&gt; realize that the rotor and probably cap are of a different size than those
&gt; that fit the 009.Can anyone point me in the right direction here?


The cap for the current Bosch mechanical advance 050 distributor is a Bosch
part number 9 231 081 413, which we sell for $9.95  The rotor is an 04012
($6.95).  The condensor is an 02086 ($6.75).
