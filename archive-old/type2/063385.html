Subject: Back out on the road and shift linkage Q....

Well, it's finally cooling off a bit here in the valley o' the sun.
The Campmobile's been sitting in the garage most of the summer -- 
partly 'cause it's been damn hot lately, but mostly because the 
thing was having a hard time getting up the hills and keeping up
to speed on the freeway...I was lucky to be able to hit 50MPH on
the flat, and it took a looong time to get going that fast. This 
was really puzzling to me, since all indications were that the engine
was in good shape -- good compression, good color to the plugs, new
points/condensor/coil, and gas mileage was great -- about 24. The only
other indication that something was amiss was that it seemed to be
running a bit hot, but then again, when it's 110F, everything seems to
run hot.

Anyway....I decided to take the bus out Saturday morning to visit the
barbershop...still not much in the way of power.  I kinda got to thinking
&quot;gee, there's not much travel in the gas pedal...hmmmm&quot; So when I got
home, I asked my lovely daughter Willow to stand on the gas pedal (yes,
the key was off!) while I went around back to have a look-see.  The 
throttle lever was only down at about a 45 degree angle. Hmmm. I found
my 8mm box wrench and moved the accelerator cable clamp from the back
of the ferrule to more like the front.  Now the throttle lever wouldn't 
go back to rest (idle). Hmmm. I grabbed the gas pedal and pulled up.
THUNK! Seems like the linkage was hanging up in the hole in the floor.
I fiddled a bit with the linkage, and I found I had at least twice the
pedal travel I had before. Took the bus out to the produce market, 
taking the freeway, and lo and behold, I was going 60 easy -- INTO THE
WIND!!!

So I brought the bus to work this morning...the hill I usually have 
to crawl up in 3rd at about 45 I was now taking at 60! And when I got
to work, I sniffed in the vent [OK, show of hands...how many of you
will admit to walking around to the back of the bus after driving for 
an hour or so and sticking your nose in the vents??], and it did smell
a lot cooler!

So I guess this is another thing to put into the ol' checklist of 
what can go wrong....looks like I was going for Pons knows how long
at 50-75% throttle....which would explain why I couldn't hold 55 and
maybe even the heat thing (low rpm's = slow fan).

The next thing to tackle is the shift linkage -- I'm having the 
classic hard shifting down into 1st-2nd, and into reverse. I replaced
the rear cage awhile back, so either that's not adjusted properly
or the front thingy (shift plate) needs attention.

Does anyone have a good procedure on adjusting the linkage? I just
remember the post about the guy who payed the local guru $50 to 
deal with it and avoid the aggravation.  I'll pull the Bentley this
afternoon and see what he has to say.

OBTW...someone just walked by my office door and commented that I
looked a lot less cranky this morning....I guess it shows!
