Subject: Spare Tire Cover Brand New Need to Sell

I just received a new spare tire cover in the mail from a great reputable Bus parts supplier, it is very nice, well constructed, white with black piping that looks really cool, unfortunatly it doesn't fit over my spare tire.

I had assumed that my spare was a stock size, but it is a 195-75/14 (which is the same size as the tires I put on the bus, so that is kind of nice).

I would like to sell it to somebody in Portland before it lays around in my garage getting ruined, I would like to sell it for the $14.95 I paid for it, the buyer saves by not paying shipping to get it.

I live in SE and work in NE, I could meet you somewhere along my path, please email me for my phone number.

Thanks,
James in Portland, Oregon
