Subject: oil temp sender

I asked this question once before a few months back but can't remember if I
got an answer. So I ask again.

I have a VDO oil temp gauge installed in my bus with an oil sump temp sender
(in a 1.5 quart deep sump). The temperature on the gauge never goes above
120 F, that is it barely moves off the stop. I know that's wrong. Has anyone
had similar problems with their VDO temp senders mounted in a similar place?
Bob
