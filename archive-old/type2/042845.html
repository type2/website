I drive my '69 pretty hard.  It's a 1600 and I drive it like I want to
get somewhere  &quot;today&quot;.

I take it on long trips 8 to 9 hours at about 70mph.  I do this about
every two to three months.  

I don't have any special gauges.  Everything is pretty much stock.  No
sump, oil filter(just screen), external oil cooler.   I don't worry about
my oil temp and such. Just watch those idiot lights.   I just put
everything together like VW engineers put it together.  Only buy German
parts if possible.  They knew what they were doing.  

Been running on this engine about 5yrs now.  And it gets hot here in West
Texas.    Just do oil changes before and after each trip, same with valve
adjustment.

Seems to be working here.
