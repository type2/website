Subject: Email to Thomas Tarka RE: Virgingia DC/busses

This is an open letter Thomas Tarka, because I lost your email address and 
phone number.  Buddy, it's been a rough couple of days.  I'd really like to 
cancel/postpone our meeting in DC today, because I have to deal with some 
things here.  If I don't get an email or phone call response from you in the 
next couple hours, I'll meet you as planned.  I don't want to leave you 
hanging.



Thanks,
Jaybird
