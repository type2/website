Subject: Re: [T2] Spring Cleaning

wayne just IMHO........
a engine should be cleaned up every 5 years depending upon usage storage etc.. etc...
 
i would say dropping the engine and doing a major clean up if never been done would be best...
i myself wouldnt want to try to get to the heads not taking the engine out...
you could even just take top tranny bolts out(ones that bolt into frame 15mm) and lower motor and tranny together rest the tranny easily on a jack stand and make sure its not to low (to keep from bending the shift rod) and then you could get to taking the tin off and etc,,,,'
reccommend just pulling it and taKING IT APART TO A LONGBLOCK AND CLEANING IT ALL BACK UP considering the xhaust you could leave it on there and few other things depending upon you and engine...?
no need in taking the oil cooler or nothing like that ,,,,,,! as long as the seals still look good?doesnt loiok like ntihing is built up around it and if the oil cooler is still good and clean...? may need taking off and cleaned out will breath so much better...that aways....
this is just the way i would do it though...
this isnt a must for someone that doesnt do there own work though unless you got some time and patience as well as help... and ther again this is just my way someone else may have a better mor efficnet way of cleaning everything up tidy,....
peace
chris
2 cents worth if that

After seeing some pictures of the &quot;crud&quot; and stuff that can get lodged in
the cylinder fins and the oil cooler and with my own experiences with mice
and their nests with my other old cars I'm thinking that I need a plan of
action when spring arrives. 

So can one get to the fins and oil cooler to clean them out without pulling
the motor? If so, which pieces of tin should/can I remove? In what order?
What's the best way to clean them?

TIA
