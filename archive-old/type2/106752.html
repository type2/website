Subject: Re: [T2] I hate to do it but ...77 Westy for sale 

&gt;I love my bus, but I haven't had time, money, patients to work on her
&gt;in long time (my graduate degree is taking all three).

In my experience it was my bus that got me through my graduate degree.  When
studying severe mental illness, being able to turn wrenches in a controlled
environment sure reduced the overall life stress.  Plus I lived in the bus
while doing all of the on campus work.
