Hi, 

EveryBus 2001 is in the works. Last years event brought together 80 buses
from 15 states and Canada together for 3 days of soggy bus fun.

I was just looking at the calender and April 13,14,15 2001 look like great
set of dates. I don't know what the IVWA Bug Bash schedule is for next year
so I can't determine if we will be keyed to Farmington. Is that an issue for
anyone?
