Subject: Re: [T2] WHat works well as fuel line plug?

&gt; I am just about the drop my engine for the first time and wondered if anyone
&gt; had some novel solution for plugging fuel lines?

I wouldn't call it 'novel', but I just use a pair of vice grips to firmly (but
not tightly) clamp the hose to the frame, plugging the line and securing it
for the drop.

-Eric
