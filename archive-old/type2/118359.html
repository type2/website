Subject: 79 FI Transporter Runs all day then starts well and  dies on
  its own...need help troubleshooting

Dear Type2,

I am having fun troubleshooting my 2000cc FI '79 Transporter.

Background Info:

It is a daily driver.  I bought it after a gentleman rebuilt the engine and
interior.

One odd thing about this engine is that it has a mechanical camshaft and I
have put hydraulic lifters in it.  It has been  running this way for 5
months.

One month ago I put Prolong, snake-oil additive, in the engine and gas tank.
I started having problems with the rust collecting in the filter and
clogging the filter.  I have since pulled the filter out three times and
blew out the rust each time.  Last week I put a brand  new filter in and I
checked it today - clean after three days of bumpy driving.  I think the
rust/prolong problem is over.

The following items are brand new.

coil
spark plugs
spark plug wires
temp II sensor
cylinders
cylinder heads
fuel pump
fuel filter
oil cooler
throw out bearing
clutch plate
main seal
hydraulic lifters


Tune Up Settings:

7.5 degrees before Top Dead Center
Idle 1000 rpm
Dwell 48 degrees
Valve clearances 1/8 turn in
Compression cold is _at_ 90 on each cylinder


The current problem goes like this.  I will go 4 - 6 days of stop and go
driving on and off the highway and she does great.   Then all of a sudden I
will go to start her up and she will start with no problem and needs to rev
at near 2000 to stay  running.  If I start to let off the accelerator too
soon (say less than a minute) (before she warms up) she will die on her
own.  She will go from 2000 RPM to 0 Rpm in 5 secs regardless of the
accelerator position.  After she dies there is a obvious abundance  of gas
smell around the Van.  Sometimes she will start up shortly thereafter and I
have to rev her at 2000 for 1 - 3 minutes  before she will idle on her own.

Since my last tune-up (one week ago) I have been experiencing something I
have never heard with this engine.  She starts strongly but then for the
first 2 minutes she runs rough and I have to rev her high - close to 2500
rpm.  There is an intermittent subtle soft popping sound and uneven firing.
After 2 minutes she evens out and runs and idles smoothly.

Other oddities.  I timed her this afternoon and noticed that the timing
light synched up 180 degrees out.  In other words with  cylinders 2 and 4
not 1 and 3.  Why?

Carbon tracks build up within a week.  I wonder if I am loosing spark
strength because the gap between the dizzy rotor and  dizzy cap studs is
excessive.  I am considering getting a complete new dizzy.

When I pull the spark plugs each one is consistently black.  Not oily black.
A dry black.  What does this indicate?

Ever since I have had this Van it seems to run rich.  Is the computer
telling the injectors to stay open much longer than they  need to be?  I
wonder if Prolong additive fouled the injector needles and they are peeing
excessively.  It does not make sense  that all four injectors would fail
simultaneously which makes me suspect the cold start valve.

Lately in Houston we have had warm weather.  During the winter though it has
gotten cold.  I have never heard the effects of a cold  start valving
working.  Is it noticeable when the cold start valve kicks in?  I wonder if
my cold start valve is leaking and/or doesn't work at all.

I have never had trouble with the ignition, starter or solenoid.  I don't
have the hot start relay and I don't think I need it  nor do I think it is
the cause of my problem.  Is this naive?

As for the FI components...I don't know much about them...I am going to
research them next...any likely culprits I should look  at first???

Thanks for reading.  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Have a great day,

Chris Walker
Houston, TX
