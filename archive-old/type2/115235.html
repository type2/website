Subject: Re: [T2] Points?

Hey-
I was discussing this a day or two ago with my local partsman. Apparently,
the &quot;beefy&quot; points are from a Rabbit. They are the same dimensions as our
regular points, but have a stronger spring. As my last points (regular
bosch) had warped out of alignment in a short period of time, I opted for
the Rabbit points, and so far, they work great.
Cheers,
Matthew




&gt; My local yocal flaps guy told me he had two different Bosch points sets.
He
said one was beefier than the other and ran close to ten bucks and the other
was $3.50. Whats the dealio?
