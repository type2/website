I found a site that lists Mcodes for the type 2, but Im still a little 
confused on some of the codes. Also, do all single cabs have a hatch on 
either side to get into the lower compartment or is us usually one side or 
the other? All I saw listed was a left side compartment door  or a right 
side compartment door. Nothing that listed for both sides.
