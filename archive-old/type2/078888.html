Subject: Is airconditioning a good idea in stock 71 Westy?

Hello,

I have a stock 1600cc 71 Westy and often times it gets pretty hot in So.
Cal... I thought about putting a fan or two, but I don't know how much this
will do. If all possible, I'd like to avoid putting an ac. It seems like
there was a factory air condition option for this year as I read in the
original manual. If I can't endure, I am thinking of putting an ac in my
westy(read an ad by a shop in San Diego area that specializes VW ac for
air-cooled). Does anyone have any idea as to it's impact on the 1600cc
engine, horse power and the engine life? I am also curious if one were to
put the ac in, how would they connect the duct into stock Westy?

Thanks!
William
