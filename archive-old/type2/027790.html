OK, we all made that complaint, RIGHT!!

Well, when you find a VW transporter in the penny saver papers, or the 
classified, why don't [you and I] contact the person selling and ask them to 
put a little card in the VW transporter for the NEW owner, introducing 
yourself as a current VW owner interested in sharing the adventure.

I mean, you could even USPS mail a note to the seller, with a letter of 
explanation.  include your e-mail address, of course.
