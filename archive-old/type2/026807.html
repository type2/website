Hello,
I wrote the original question.
Answer is yes, I have all the tin, mounts etc.
Basically, the 79's crankshaft snapped (have a
feeling the case is toast but havent checked yet),
and I was going to install the 80 (friend gave it to me) if
it was easy enough.

If you guys are saying it's a pain in the ass,
mabye im suddenly in the market for a running or rebuildable
78-79 engine.

Thanks for your help.

&gt;But he has 79 tin, shroud and alternator mount doesn't he?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The tin is different, the shroud is different, the way the alternator
&gt;&gt;connects is different, the oil breather is different, way more of a pain 
&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt;the ass then it would be worth.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have a air cooled 73, and a 81, I have both engines in the garage (the 
&gt;&gt;73
&gt;&gt;motor is from a 77) and I will tell you it is significantly different but
&gt;&gt;similar.  I am sure it could be done, but I would take an easier route.
&gt;
&gt;Very minor case differences that shouldn't matter and the  79
&gt;(071)heads are the same which is the big difference.  Swap out the
&gt;heater boxes, tin, shroud,  alt mount, and which ever way you are
&gt;going with the dip stick.  Drill out the 79 engine mounts to 12mm and
&gt;it should fit just fine.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I just went the other direction.  Put a 78 case into a 83 Vanagon.
&gt;Only difference is the engine carrier inserts in the case need to be
&gt;enlarged to 12 mm and I needed to drill a hole for the dip stick.  No
&gt;sweat!  I'm going to build a spare long block this way also so I can
&gt;use it on my 77 also (with vanagon heater boxes)
