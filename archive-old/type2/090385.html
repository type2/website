&gt; OK, I found some Bridgestone RD-603 LT tires in the
&gt; archives. 185R14 ST 8 ply. Load: D. 65 PSI. Max load:
&gt; 1850 lbs. I found them locally, purchasing, mounting,
&gt; balancing, and all, a grand total of $343.65.... Sound
&gt; good?                              -Paul Deatherage

I use them and like them.  They're OEM on some 1-ton Toyota pickups
