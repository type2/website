Subject: UPDATE ON STUCK VALVE

Hello,

Thanks to all who responded to my stuck valve question.
I made it home but it was scary slow , i wouldn't do it again.
luckily my drive home is down a country road with not too
many vehicles but i had some bad instances with large
trucks, had to pull over to the edge.
Got home and took the head off with the engine in.
only issues were the tin. man that valve was far down
in the hole...i read the Bentley and they claim it is
hard to replace the valve seat...special tools etc.
has anyone had a valve seat replaced?

Thanks,
Darren
