Subject: RE: [T2] Trade 79 parts bus with title

It's amazing how different states handle this. I had a 78 Hondamatic
motorcycle and CT told me I needed a court paper to help me get a title. I
moved to Virginia and they said I could register no problem.

Anyway, the other option you could have is if you have a friend in a
friendly state, you can &quot;sell&quot; the bus to him, have him get certificate of
ownership and then he could &quot;sell&quot; the bus back to you. In CT they don't
issue titles for cars over 25 years old, but they do give you registration
papers. So if you sold to someone in CT, you can then go back to your DMV
and say you're buying a car from a guy in CT with no title, but CT will not
issue a title on a car older than 25 years, but he has all of ownership
paperwork. This could kind of force your DMV's hand on the issue. They can't
force you to get something that another state won't give I wouldn't think.

I've had to do this with a buddy's vintage Ford Econoline van. Worked for
Maryland.

Just a thought. Damn regulations lol!
