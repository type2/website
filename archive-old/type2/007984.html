Hi Group, I recently put a 2.0L Fuel Injected motor back in my 78 bus.  I must have missed something. Thanks to all of you I now have the vacume lines right but the injectors still aren't working. I get fuel all the way to them and then it's just stops.  I took one suggestion and and squirted some carb cleaner in the air intake to see if everything else was right and the motor ran for a second.  I've triple checked all the plugs, lines, resistors, battery has the juice, etc.  Any ideas or other tests I can run.  
Thanks Dennis
