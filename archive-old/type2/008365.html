&gt;Anyone have a  complete propane tank assembly  for a '78 for sale?
&gt;
&gt;TIA

Thomas,

I have one and I'm willing to sell it, but I'm not sure what a fair 
price would be.  I've been told they're worth everything from $150 to 
$500, and believe it or not the salvage yard at $500 says he sells all 
he can get at that price. I know I would never pay that, but if our 
fellow listees can give us a good estimate of &quot;fair price&quot; I would 
probably take it.  I know it will have to be at least $150 because I 
have already turned that down and another salvage yard said that's what 
he sold them for 10 years ago, but he hasn't had one recently.
 
If this price is in your range and the list gives us some figures I'm 
willing to deal.  The tank and hose is in good shape and came from a '78 
Westy. So what do you listees think is a fair price?

Thanks,

Randall Gammill
