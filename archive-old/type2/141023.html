Subject: Re: [T2] microbus news 

The thing that absolutly infuriates me ... today ... is these 24&quot; TVs for 
sale for $150.00 everywhere - here in Canada about 1/2 the food stores sell 
em the largest hardward store chain (Crappy Tire)  ... Walmart .. everywhere 
you go practically you can buy a 24&quot; TV for under $200 (at least it seems 
like that) - those things will never be fixed - ever - who is going to pay 
$75.00 to fix a two year old TV that only cost $200.00 - my bet is in 5 
years some very large percentage of those pieces of crap are going to be in 
land fill somewhere and everybody knows this - yet the slaves in China keep 
pumpin' em out - the large store chains keep sellin' em - and we, 
apparently, keep buying them - progress I guess

yeah - coolin' off here too.
