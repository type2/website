Subject: Re: Fitting a muffler

&gt;On my 1600 twin-port type 1 engine I found that it was made slightly easier if
&gt;I slacked off the nuts that hold the input manifold on to the block. This 
&gt;enabled me to jiggle the input manifold a bit and made lining up the bolts 
&gt;for the pre-heat tube easier.

This might not be a good idea since the metal gaskets between the DP
manifold and head have raised compression areas--you might be setting
yourself up for future vacuum leaks by loosening and retorquing the
manifolds (maybe just overcaution here on my part, but I offer it anyway).

I use various size screwdrivers as levers to coax the pre-heat tube on the
manifold to line up with the flange on the muffler.  Having 3 hands helps,
but a two handed person cursing profusely also works ;).
