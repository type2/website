Subject: heat exchanger??

Ok. Well Im pretty sure that its the heat exchanger. Thats what it looks 
like to me. Its right below and to the side kinda of the heads in my 72 with 
a type4 engine. Im right aren't I?? Then there is a tube thing that connects 
each of them to these long cannals that goes to the front. So now that we 
are all on the same page and you know what I'm talking about (cause you do 
right??) What is the whole purpose behind it. Is it only for heating 
purposes?? How do you remove it? Could I drive with it removed?? I live in 
California and when do you ever need a heater in California? The reason that 
I am asking is that I finally got around to taking things upon myself and 
adjusting my own valves and the damn heat exchanger thing is right in the 
way!! I was having a bear of a time adjusting them and I was hoping that I 
could just take them out without any damage. Well Hope someone will give me 
some feedback on this one. Thanks

Joey Patino
