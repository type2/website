Mice have ate holes in the large (foamish seal?) It runs around the engine
and I believe seals against the tin? When engine door is open if you look
down you see it, all along then curving by the battery trays and out of
sight. My question is what's this (seal?) called. I'm trying to order from
Ron or whoever but can't find it, I'm sure it's sold and I'm just not
calling it by it's right name. How far around does it go, can you get it all
installed with the engine in? Can you replace just bad parts that you can
get to? Is this seal pressure fit or do you use some kinda glue?

Thanks Ray
