Hi Volks,

Last week sometime, I found either through this group or in searching, some
round VW fans that fit in the ductwork above the kickboard in the front. It
seems you pull off the channel cover and these units bolt right in. I have
checked the archives to no avail. Does anyone remember this. The poster
listed the VW Part number for this item and indicated that they were quite
rare. I would like to find a pair in working or non-working order. (I'm sure
everyone would like a set.) Any help would be greatly appreciated.
