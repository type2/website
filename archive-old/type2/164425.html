Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] digital timing light power source...

Terry asked: &lt;snip&gt; Why would you want to carry a timing light around
with you anyway?



... I always carry a timing light.  I've had several occasions where a
point set has gone south requiring a replacement.... and of course, that
leads to a need to reset the timing.
