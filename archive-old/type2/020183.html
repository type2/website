I followed his advice on soundproofing, very effective, BUT I wish i never did
it. Using the roofing material as sound dampening was a big mistake. It works
but what a complete mess. Also Im worried about the consequences it will have
for trying to do any body repair and what it may do to accelerate rust.  Wish
i had thought it through more carefully. It is very effective but i'd make the
warning that there may be unintended consequences to following the procedure
to the t.
good luck though which ever route you take

&gt; Anyone serious about heat in you bus/van should have a look at G. M.
&gt; Bulley's pages at http://bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex.  A ton of good
&gt; heat/noise/rust info.
