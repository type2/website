&gt;So, the heads were just barely still under warranty from a certain rebuilder in Sacramento.  The company has always been helpful and they asked me to send the heads back.  Today, I got a call from the company, as it turns out, the exhaust valves were all burnt.  I was asked how I had the valves/lifters adjusted and I replied, &quot;2 full turns past zero lash, just as Bently instructs for the hydraulics.&quot;  I was told that I should have adjusted the valves to one turn, as 2 turns &quot;will almost certainly cause this condition to happen.&quot;

I really doubt it simply because there are many, many people on this list who use that procedure and have not had problems.  That being said, I am not one of those people.  I set my hydraulics to 1/2 turn in because I *am* worried about burning the valves.  

If the valves become loose, they will start to get noisy as valve lash increases.  If the valves become tight, you will hear nothing, compression will drop and the valves will burn.  The farther you turn in your adjusters past zero lash, the closer you are to potentially having tight valves.  I err on the side of caution and keep my ears open for loose valves.

I still think they were feeding you a line though, and they certainly should have made it clear how they wanted them adjusted if they are going to try to hold you to it.
