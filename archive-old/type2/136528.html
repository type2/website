Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Codes - 70 Type 2

Scott,

The engine probably has been rebuilt into a different monster than whatever
the code indicates, and it's entirely possible (likely?) that the engine is a
1584cc (1600) built on a case that used to be a 1493cc engine.  Hard to tell
when it's in the vehicle!

If you need a new engine, remember that on a 68-71 Bus, you have the option of
a factory-new engine from Mexico.
I seriously considered attempting to rebuild the engine myself, but given my
lack of experience in engine-building and the very small difference in cost, I
couldn't resist.  I mean... how many other 35-year-old vehicles have brand-new
engines available from the factory?  Surely my Bus will grant me additional
engine-rebuilding opportunities in the future, but there will come a day when
new Type 1 engines are no longer available.

Two years ago, as a beginner, I found that just removing the old engine,
cleaning things up, and getting the new engine ready with help from a
listmember were more than enough to keep me thoroughly entertained.  A new
Meximotor costs anywhere from $1300-1500+shipping depending on where you order
it, vs. something like $1000+core for a professionally rebuilt T1 engine, or
$??? in parts/machine shop work, plus your time, to rebuild it yourself.  If
your current engine has the single-port heads that would be stock for a '70
Bus, you would also need a dual-port manifold.

Just something to consider!  You're lucky to have lots of options.

Cheers!

- Miles
