Subject: exhaust leak-Found, but...

After replacing my muffler and pulling the heater boxes, I finally located 
the source of my exhaust leak...none of the above.  It was one of the bolts 
in the cylinder head which had worked itself out of the smog hole.  I 
remember way back that it never fit quite right so it was glued in with RTV 
silicone stuff (7years ago).  I am trying to find out what size bolt would 
fit in the smog hole.  I could always shove it back in with the silicone, 
but I was hoping for a better solution.  Somewhere out there is a bolt that 
fits those threads and bolts are so cheap and plentiful. If not, it`s the 
RTV for another 7 years of wilderness mechanic motoring.  BTW, my muffler 
actually was toast, so that was the first suspect, but a muffler leak sounds 
much different than a head leak.  I will know better next time.  Thanks as 
always for the help.

-James
