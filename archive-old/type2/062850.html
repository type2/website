&gt;Jim,
&gt;How 'bout sketching some diagrams and layouts of your designs?
&gt;Better yet, take some photos, scan them and put them on as
&gt;attachments for us to see!  Your hard work should be visual....
&gt;people around here appreciate stuff like this!

Ummm... fine except for the part about attaching photos.  If that isn't
forbidden by the list charter, it should be.  We'd love to see photos of
your stuff, but please just make them available by anonymous FTP or put
them up on a web site.  Thanks!
