Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Wheel cylinders - Do Type3 fit Type 1??


&gt;Another thing to consider is the stopping power of rear discs.  Don't you 
&gt;need a proportioning valve to lessen the pressure to the rear brake 
&gt;hydraulics, so you don't lock and slide under hard braking?  The chances 
&gt;of such an occurrence with rear drums is MUCH less, is it not?  Hydraulic 
&gt;gurus?  Anyone?  Bueller? ;^)

I was running 4 wheel discs with a Karmann Ghia master cylinder. It braked 
pretty good and pretty evenly.

You could add a proportion valve it you needed to but I found my setup 
worked just fine.

K-G brakes up front, 914 discs and calipers out back. CB Performance kit. 
Build your own, the kit was big $$$ and all VW and Porsche off the shelf 
parts except the rear caliper bracket (also easy to make).
