Subject: Dear Mr. Hover

&gt;Dear Mr. Hover,
&gt;
&gt;I've just discovered your web page.  Great Stuff!
&gt;
&gt;I wonder if you can help me with a funny problem I've been having?  
&gt;I've recently acquired a 1966 Volkswagen Beetle.  It runs pretty
&gt;good for such an old car but it leaks a lot of oil.  
&gt;The worst leak is at the oil pressure sensor.
&gt;
&gt;My Beetle is a six volt system, all original.  When I tried to buy
&gt;a six volt oil pressure sensor the man said there was no such
&gt;thing.  I have been using a book called &quot;How to Keep Your Volkswagen
&gt;Alive&quot; by John Muir.  On page 85 Mr. Muir says 'Be sure and get
&gt;a six volt sensor if your car is 6 volt and a twelve volt sensor
&gt;for a 12 volt system'.  He also warns that VW occasionally will
&gt;sell a bad oil pressure sensor.
&gt;
&gt;I showed the passage in Mr. Muir's book to the parts man but 
&gt;he just laughed and wouldn't discuss it.
&gt;
&gt;I've asked other people and they say if I have a 6v system I  
&gt;can not use 12 volt parts.  Are 6v oil pressure sensors still available?
&gt;and if so, would you please provide me with an address or phone number.

Dear Jon,

The guy behind the parts counter is correct and Mr. Muir is wrong.  There is
only one type of oil pressure sensor; the same sensor is used on both 6 volt
and 12 volt models.  The oil pressure sensor is a switch.  It does not care
if you feed it 6 volts or twelve. 

I'm not sure which edition of the 'Idiot's Guide' you have.  There are about
two dozen and each has its share of errors, some serious others merely
stupid, such as the 6v-vs-12v oil pressure sensor.  Sadly, the people
presently running John Muir Publications (John died in 1977) do not seem
especially sensitive to the question of accuracy -- or even Volkswagens.
 (JMP now offers 'Idiot's Guides' for everything except Sherman tanks.) 

Errors aside, I think you'll find John Muir's book of value.  But as the
Mechanic-in-Charge of your vehicle, for that is what you are, you're going to
have to get into the habit of thinking for yourself.  Don't accept ANY advice
at face value (including mine).  

Despite all modern advances auto mechanics is not yet a science.  It contains
elements of the manual arts and even, as John Muir has shown us, a certain
amount of philosophy.  Read his book for that if nothing else.  But in the
most practical vein, some of John's instructions, such as pounding on your
axle- or blower-nut with a hammer and chisel, are destructive -- doing so
inflicts concealed damage on the bearings in your gearbox or generator. 

 John's errors were not malicious, they simply defined the limits of his
skills.  Taken overall, I think you'll find the good outweighs the bad.
