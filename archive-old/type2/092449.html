Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Blown Jug&quot; on '77 Westfalia Van

[...]
recommend the long block route.  It is quicker and much more cost 
effective as well.  dont know what delivery time would be but I show 
busdepot lists engines for just below 1100 before shipping/core/whatever 
else

&gt; My mechanic tells me my van has a blown cylinder.  I live in N. 
&gt; Wisconsin and far from any dedicated VW mechanics.  My mechanic is a 
&gt; competent, honest man.  He will remove the engine but hasn't worked on 
&gt; a bus since the early '70s and is hesitant to take on a rebuild (he is 
&gt; the guy everybody goes to and can't cut the time from most of us 
&gt; desperate ones that need work done right now to get the clunker to 
&gt; work).  He suggested getting a &quot;long block&quot; and having him install it 
&gt; as he can find time.  There are other guys in the area that have worked 
&gt; on aircooled engines...he is checking with them on the expense of a 
&gt; part by part rebuild, but I do not know their expertise.
&gt;
&gt; Suggestions of where to get a long block that is likely to be worth 
&gt; installing in the van?  I looked around on the internet and have found 
&gt; prices from about 1100$ to 1500$.
&gt;
&gt; The van is a '77 Westphalia with 190K miles.  I had the engine rebuilt 
&gt; at about 85K and have had the manual transmission replaced. I drive it 
&gt; only on camping trips in the summer and just love this thing, having 
&gt; owned it since 1982.  I am a single guy 55 years old and have 2 little 
&gt; autistic kids and would pay to cut the chances of breaking down a 
&gt; thousand miles from home.
&gt;
&gt; Your experise/experience/advice/suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
