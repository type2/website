&gt;He can eat a lot of fish, we surmise, and he tolerates children well, which
&gt;around here is pretty much all it takes to become a hero.

That and bus problems. You must be able/willing to tolerate bus problems. If you can actually fix them, as Steve has demonstrated, Hero status is well within your reach.

I had an enjoyable evening last night as my four children destroyed Ken and Erin's home. It was nice to finally meet Steve. Great bus. Excellent dude! Awesome viddles. In a way I'm glad Ken has Steve around a little longer. A little more time and we can start to work on some of his northern ways. ;-) Be careful crossing Arkansas, though, Steve! If you get stranded there for more than a couple days, your kinfolk may start appearing attractive to you. There is an antecdote, but it involves a wife and cloning yourself several times.

Save passage and God's speed. Joe
