Subject: Re: [T2] Farfignugen!!

Todd, just wait until you see all the smiles, waves, honks and longing,
soulful looks you get when you're out and about in your T2. Lots of people
have memories of these cars and they'll even want to stop and tell you about
their long lost VW T2 love. They were a very well-loved vehicle. They have a
friendly, happy &quot;personality&quot;. The kids especially take a lot of looks and
say things like, &quot;Cool!&quot;.You're going to find out that you have a whole
family of VW lovers out there that you never dreamed existed.
