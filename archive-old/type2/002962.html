Hi people, thought I would show you the pics of my new Westy, just click on
the descriptions to see the good, the bad, and the ugly! :-) It is actually
in very good shape, automatic with air conditioning, but I lifted the carpet
in the living area and ewhhhhh!!!The rust looks worse than it really is,
lots of it is the slag and chips lying there after a good hammering. I'm
looking for the replacement panel anyways to put in here but all I can find
is the universal replacement piece that is 15&quot; by 58&quot;. You can see my other
VW in the background a very early 70 Canadian Standard 1200.
