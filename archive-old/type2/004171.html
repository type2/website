One question was not answered: How do you know if your engine ('71 Type 1
1600 DP in a 66 bus) in your vintage bus is too hot WITHOUT GAUGES?  Is
Muir's suggestion of &quot;If you can hold the dipstick in your hand for a couple
of seconds without burning your fingers off, then your engine is running
cool enough&quot; an accurate standard by which to measure?  Anyone have any
other little tricks for estimating engine temp

One &quot;trick&quot; is to smell the engine.  An engine that is running too hot will
definately have a distinctive odor.
An inexpensive, easy add-on is the Gene Berg oil dipstick sender which
attaches to the oil pressure switch.  Some people don't like wiring two
separate items to the same idiot light, but if you have ever used one of
these senders, you can immediately tell the difference between low oil
pressure and high oil temp by the distinctive  flicker of the light when the
engine is running hot. It is an incredibly easy installation, and I think it
is worth the $15. or so.  Gauges are better, IMHO, but I'm not taking mine
off (which is actually a short version threaded into the Type lll dipstick
block-off plate), because I like the idiot light function.  I can't stare at
gauges all the time!
