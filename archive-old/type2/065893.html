Subject: FS:  Rust-Free '77 Westfalia Camper, $1975.00 (Pa.)

Tiaga Green '77 Westfalia, deluxe camper package (sink, stove, fridge, 
etc.).

Bus is from California. **NO RUST!!** (Okay, just a tiny bit of surface 
rust under the windshield, but not much there either.) Paint is pretty 
good. Has one notable dent, at the right rear tail lens. (Also a very small 
one on the nose, not very noticable.)  Also, windshield has a couple of 
stone chips, and a small crack at the very bottom. 

Runs well. '78 2 liter hydraulic-lifter motor (no valve adjustments 
needed!), good compression all around, good clutch, good heater boxes.  
Leaks a little oil. Hand brake does not work. 

Interior needs some cosmetics. The woodgrain laminate on most of the 
cabinet doors is chipping/chipped off, and the front passenger seat needs 
to be restuffed. (Fabric is OK, though.) Also the carpet could use a good 
cleaning.  The stove and sink work fine, and both beds (sofabed and top 
bunk bed) are fine.  

The poptop canvas is shot. However, there is a very nice (and probably 
expensive) awning attached to the side, which is in good condition.

Summary: with a little bit of work (poptop canvas, one dent, some interior 
cosmetics) this could be a very fine bus.  The body is completely solid and 
the engine is strong. 

Price: $1975. If the above work were done, this would easily be a $4000 
bus. I am in Pa., between Philadelphia and Allentown.  E-mail or (610) 
754-8989.

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
