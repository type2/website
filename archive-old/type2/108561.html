&gt;  despite taking all of the necassary precautions and
&gt; having decent covers mine seem to leak more often than i care to admit.
&gt;  so please enlighten me.


Forgot to add to make sure you have a very clean, smooth surface on the
head. I take some fine synthetic steel wool and clean mine off. The stuff is
called steel wool 2 bought at local home improvement store.
