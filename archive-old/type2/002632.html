 &gt; I want to put this engine and the tranny into my 69, but put a doghouse
oil cooler on instead.
 &gt; First, is this even possible (I hope so) second, where can I get the
doghouse parts (I need the cooler, tin and shroud?) new vs. bone yard.
&gt; Should they be for the engine year or the body year?

Any bug engine with a doghouse set-up will give you all the parts you need
EXCEPT the front upper tin. That piece is 71 bus ONLY. Make sure you also
get the L bracket that mounts on the oil cooler. Nick-named the 'hoover
bit'.
And if you or anyone else needs the 71 bus-only upper front tin, I have 2 of
them......
