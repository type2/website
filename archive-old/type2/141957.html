Subject: Need a thermostat bracket, pulley and pertinent parts

Well, having looked my engine over, I can see I need the following parts to put my Type 1 thermostat on.

I need a bracket and necessary mounting bolts.
I need the pulley and mounting bolts.

I think that is all I need, I have the thermostat, and a cable, and the rest of the flap assembly is in place, along with return spring and little nut and bolt to attach the cable to.

Does anyone have any of this in their spares box. they'd be willing to pass along or sell to me?

Many thanks,
Courtney Hook
