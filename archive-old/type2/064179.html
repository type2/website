Subject: Re: Why adjust valves?

Bren,
  The engine in my bus is a '74 1800cc twin carbs engine with sodium filled
exhaust valves. The valve gap for these sodium thingies is 0.08, while the
intake valves (not sodium filled) are set to the usual 0.06.
  So the answer to your question is yes, but don't ask me why...
Hope this helps,
  Ciao,
                Gregor

                 &gt; So this
begs the question, would the addition of sodium- filled or
&gt; mercury-filled valves, which have the ability to more efficiently channel
&gt; heat out of the combustion chamber, change the gap between stem and
&gt; adjusting screw?
&gt;
&gt; I know the answer is probably no, but I'd be interested in why?
