Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

&gt; &gt;If Califonicadia requires the pump down there, there would be a
&gt; &gt;market if it is still functional (not likely).

&gt; they can still occasionally be  found in the Pick-A-Part places, usually
lying inside or next to the bus in  a pile of parts that were hastily
stripped from the engine in order to pull it.

We no longer have inspections on 73 models, which is not quite the same as
saying the pump is no longer required, but amounts to much the same.  Is a
law which is not enforced still a law?  If a tree falls...  I've never
actually seen one in my yard hauntings, but I did see one of the fan
housings with the little extra bosses.  Shoulda grabbed it.

 Regards,

Grant
