I'd be careful about trusting the gears to hold the bus in place. Had a
Toyota run away from home once when it popped out of gear. Landed in a
mesquite tree, but that is another story.

My emergency brake is a brick. I carry it in the back of my bus. I just
stick it behind the back wheel when I park on an incline if there isn't a
curb to turn the wheels against.
