This 1980's Camper Thinks It's an S.U.V. 
By CHRIS DIXON 

The New York Times
July 18, 2003 

SOUNDING and bouncing through the dusty backcountry of the  Hollister
Hills in central California, Ron Lussier demonstrated a rugged bravado
that would do the steeliest off-roader proud. &quot;You know,&quot; he said,
&quot;roads like this are really the only valid reason for owning a Humvee.
They're completely silly in cities or even driving down the freeway.
But get back here in one, and you can have some serious fun.&quot;

After easily clearing a three-foot berm on Bonanza Gulch Road, Mr.
Lussier headed for  an alarmingly steep route, marked by a sign with a
single black diamond, indicating a particularly tough off-road drive.
Not convinced that his vehicle would make the ascent, I climbed out of
the passenger seat and clambered up the road, occasionally on hands and
knees, to watch his attempt. He released his clutch and lurched upward.
Four knobby tires clawed the ground, and in about 20 seconds he made
it,  leaving several hooting onlookers, including me, astounded.  Mr.
Lussier was not driving a Hummer; he was in a 1991 Volkswagen Vanagon
Westfalia Syncro camper.

That's right: camper. After this grueling backcountry jaunt, the Syncro
converted into a well-equipped R.V. - a trick no Hummer has ever
mastered. And Mr. Lussier, a photographer  from San Francisco,  settled
in for the night.

Produced in Germany and sold in America from 1986 to 1991, the Syncro
Vanagon, a four-wheel-drive version of the standard, boxy 1980's
Vanagon, is now exceedingly rare, and rarer still are the camper models
- the fully outfitted pop-top version made by  Westfalia in Germany and
the hardwood-trimmed  models  modified by  Adventurewagen or Country
Homes in the United States. The Syncro has a military-inspired
undercarriage and  a jacked-up drive train with a special gear for
climbing hills; on the camper models attachments fold out, slide out
and pop up to create sleeping space.

More than 50 Syncro owners, who had largely met through  Syncro_dot_org or
an Internet mailing list,  gathered a few weeks ago  in an oak-shaded
campground in the Hollister Hills State Vehicular Recreation Area  to
compare notes and put their vans through the paces on challenging and
beautiful backcountry roads. The vans are an anomaly amid the Jeeps,
Land Rovers and four-wheel-drive pickup trucks that usually ride this
terrain. &quot;People do get pretty surprised when they see us back here,&quot;
Mr. Lussier said as he rolled  back into camp after our white-knuckle
ride.

No one, not even Volkswagen, seems to know for sure, but hard-core
Syncronauts estimate that only about 5,000 Syncros - 1,500 campers and
3,500 passenger vans - were sold in the United States. Well-preserved
camper models  now sell for almost  their original sticker price of
around $18,000 and are appreciating in value.

The couple - a married former Roman Catholic priest and a former nun -
who sold Mr. Lussier his  Syncro told him they had driven it from
California to Alaska, where they lived in it. Mr. Lussier once shipped
it to Venezuela and drove it through Brazil. Now, with upgraded shocks,
wheels and a gleaming paint job, it  is in superb condition.  &quot;I don't
believe in mollycoddling it,&quot; he said. &quot;You've  got to use it.
Otherwise, what's the point in having it?&quot;

Brian Smith, 44, of Oceanside, Calif.,  has  a 1987 Syncro camper that
he has customized with a microwave, toaster oven, camp heater and
external generator. &quot;I swear to God if someone offered me $50,000 for
this car,&quot; he said, &quot;I wouldn't sell it.&quot; He added:  &quot;I drove it down
to Tulm in the Yucatn and camped right on the beach. I went through
Chiapas and saw the waterfalls and rain forests. You can go and camp 10
feet from the water, completely self-contained.&quot;

These Syncro enthusiasts were preaching to the converted. Last year I
purchased my own 1986 Syncro camper, paying $12,000 to a family in Los
Angeles who had  named it Cecilia. For me, Cecilia represented the
ultimate journalist's tool. In it, I could get nearly anywhere to cover
a story, and  I wouldn't need  a hotel. I could fix a cup of hot
coffee, plug in a power inverter to run my cellphone-connected laptop
and type away.

Of course, there was also the promise of camping adventures with my
wife, Quinn,  which we have pursued with abandon across California's
outback. And like many other Syncro converts, we soon began to wonder
why there weren't more of these versatile vehicles on the roads.

As Christian Bokich, a brand marketing strategist at Volkswagen, and
Thomas Niksch, a mechanical engineer who runs  a German Syncro
enthusiasts' Web site (www.syncro16_dot_de), tell the story, the Syncro was
both behind and ahead of its time. At $18,000, the camper model was
expensive  for 1986, yet it had only a 90-horsepower engine, better
suited to a Beetle than a 4,000-pound van. It was complicated to
manufacture, and Volkswagen was concentrating at that time on building
a new minivan. The company was loath even to promote the Syncro, though
magazines like Car and Driver gave it glowing reviews.

&quot;I've had a lot of contact with managers from that time,&quot; Mr. Bokich
said. &quot;They said that the biggest challenge was that people weren't
getting the message about the Syncro.&quot;

The Syncro's origins go back to  the late 1970's when two Volkswagen
engineers, dreaming of a vehicle they could use to camp and travel to
remote places like the Sahara desert, built some prototypes. In the
mid-1980's, Steyr-Daimler-Puch, manufacturer of a legendary military
off-road vehicle called the Pinzgauer, teamed up with Volkswagen to
design and manufacture the Syncro.

IN many ways, it was a groundbreaking ground pounder. An independently
suspended four-wheel-drive system gave it excellent ground clearance
and kept all four wheels planted in challenging terrain. A locking
system gave it tanklike traction by preventing any one wheel from
breaking free and spinning.  A viscous coupler, now a common device,
automatically engaged the four-wheel-drive in response to any slippage
in the rear wheels. Many of the inventions found in the Syncro have
since made their way into vehicles like the Subaru Outback and
Volkswagen's own new S.U.V., the Touareg.

But it was the camper model that truly distinguished the Syncro. In it
you could keep food fresh  in a small refrigerator, cook it on a
two-burner stove, wash the dishes in a stainless-steel sink with water
from a 13-gallon tank, store  gear in a series of cabinets and sleep
four people comfortably. The little-known Syncro camper was a
backcountry mobile home, the ultimate expression of a  sport utility
vehicle before the term was even coined.

At the Hollister camp,  Brent Christensen, a director of product
development for a software company in Santa Barbara, Calif., described
a family trip &quot;all the way up the coast, close to Seattle, then through
the Sierras&quot; with stops at  out-of-the-way campsites. &quot;We'll say,
`There's a neat-looking site, but it's right over that big berm and
down between those two trees,' &quot; he said. &quot; `Let's see if we can get
down there.' The next morning we wake up with the creek outside our
front door.&quot;

Eric Ching, 35, a  lifeguard from Huntington Beach, Calif., and his
wife, Tina Om, have taken their 2-year-old daughter, Zoe, around
California with them, charging in their 1990 Syncro through the soft
sand dunes of Pismo Beach and the deep snow of Mammoth Mountain and up
the punishing hills  at Hollister (where Zoe snoozed in her car seat
the whole way).  &quot;We like going places you don't see people,&quot; Mr. Ching
said.

Brian Smith's Syncro traveled the world even before he and his family
began taking it on  trips to Mexico. &quot;The guy who owned it before me
was a diplomat,&quot; Mr. Smith said. &quot;They shipped him out to Africa to
work and he shipped the van. He was with his wife and two kids camping
in the van and they woke up one morning and thought there was an
earthquake. They look out the window and there's an elephant running at
them. He just jumped down from his bed with the pop-top up and started
driving. The elephant collapsed the back hatch but they got away.&quot;

The  Internet has not only coalesced the thinly spread community of
Syncro zealots, but created a viable market for Syncro parts. Today,
you can buy any Syncro part online, including oversized South African
VW wheels and improved suspension components from Australia. You can
even swap the  engine for a more powerful VW turbodiesel or a Subaru
Outback powerplant.

Mr. Lussier said he was  already wondering  how to put an electric
engine in his Syncro in the distant future, when he expects petroleum
use to be banned.

Like several owners at Hollister, he said flatly that he would never
sell his Syncro.

I think I'll hang on to mine, too.
