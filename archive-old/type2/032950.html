From;    TWWM    {the world's worst mechanic}  Yesterday we had
something very similar happen to our &quot;Bessie&quot;  the Grateful Dead
bus--the gas in the Phoenix area is &quot;oxygenated&quot; to the nth degree!! I
use two filters on each of the 4 VWs we own-- You would be surprised
with the problems this type of fuel can cause!--We get a lot of Snow
Birds during the winter here in Phoenix and Aridzona--Cars from out of
state experience the same thing and many of these are just 4 to 5 years
old!!  I feel that if something like this happens--And you get NO
Backfire--then it is a fuel problem--An old trick is to take the
aircleaner off--if you have one--Have someone rev up the motor--then put
your hand over the top of the carb--this will cause a great suction!!
and suck out all the goop in the carp and lines. We call it the $1.98
tune up--Please do not ask why $1.98!! but it does work--TWWM--uncle
