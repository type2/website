Subject: [T2] Re: Anybody used Fred's VW in San Carlos CA?

Is this the San Carlos that's next to Santee in San Diego CA?

It might have been Fred's VW- I dealt with some VW place out there.
Scroungy looking shop, mostly worked on racing engines as far as I could
tell. When I was gearing up for my first ever rebuild on my '78 Westy
back in '94. Guy there tried to disempower me - persuade me there was no
way I could ever do the job myself without screwing up and wasting all my
money- so I should hire him to do the job for me. Pissed me off. I never
went back. Heard bad stories about the place from other VW sources after
that- rebuilt an engine for a woman and filled it with worn out parts
while charging her dearly for new ones.

If you're in that area, I'd recommend instead that you deal with
machinist Don Bolton, Bug Patch, 9470 W. Heaney Circle, Santee 92071
(619)449-8670. Telephone prefix may have changed in recent years. This guy
does good work, is pretty honest, and was super helpful in setting me up
with everything I needed to rebuild my own engine.

Your actual mileage may vary.

Good luck,
