&gt;        Well after everyone's encouraging comments like 'go for it', 'why
&gt;not', and 'its like playing with tinker-toy' I have decided to fix my zero
&gt;compression in once cylinder problem myself.  My problem now is to decide
&gt;what or what not to do.  Is a top-end rebuild enough or should I go for the
&gt;whole schmear; how do I decide?   What else should I look into ? She is a 74
&gt;Westy with 124K miles and in decent condition, the PO neglected her (nary a
&gt;valve adjustment or tune-up in a year), but the PPO had a VW mechanic son
&gt;who kept it in really good condition. AFter 22 years and 124K miles what
&gt;else might need a little TLC or should I just fix the compression problem.
&gt;My other question was how do I support the transmission when I drop the
&gt;engine, is a couple of stacks of bricks and a two by four enough?

You don't need to support the transmission.  It is supported by a carrier
at the rear.  Pull the heads first and see if you find the cause of loss of
compression.  It's probably a valve problem.  If so, I would replace/fix
the heads and leave the bottom end alone.  Three times as much work if you
mess with the bottom end.

&gt;Thirdly does anyone know of anywhere in the Vancouver (B.C.) area where
&gt;parts are readily available, after hearing all of the J.C. Whipme stories
&gt;I'm not terribly keen on ordering through them.

They don't have any type IV engine parts anyway.  Cofap parts are okay,
German are better but more expensive.  Check the VW mags, or just order
from a reputable place such as Pauter Machine or Mark Stephens.

Oh, you said Vancouver?  You can get all of the parts you need from Tobin's
bus.  :)
