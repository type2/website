Subject: RE: Heater Control REsponse

To all,

        Thanks to all who responded to my heater control question. I would thank you all 
individually but I spend enough time just reading all the posts I get. Tuesday after the holiday I 
had 228 posts waiting for me. Until I get an address at home I am forced to use my office one. I 
wish I could contribute more technical advice. Being a first time owner, I am in the dark about so 
much. Everytime I turn the key I just pray it starts. Having good luck so far. It runs fairly rough 
on cold mornings till it warms up. Other than that everything seems to work fine. Keeping fingers 
crossed.
