Subject: fantasy bus...

cool idea, man!

my ultimate fantasy is a 21 window with two tone paint, green/white, a new
3.6L porshe turbo engine (yeah, 400+ horsepower!), a syncro westy
drivetrain, but with adjustable shocks to lower it for road driving, and
wide tires.  of course it would have a full westy interior, and a set of
recaros in front.  a nice clear stereo and gas heater would round out the
package.

i would just love to out-drag a snobby little mustang owner, then go
camping in the woods afterward!  i could even pull a trailer with this
van, and still pass people!

just dreaming...i will never be able to afford even the engine for this
thing!
