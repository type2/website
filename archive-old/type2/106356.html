Subject: Re: [T2] Electric or Propane conversions

&gt;Probably not do-able.  There will be a physical limitation to the voltage 
&gt;you can achieve with solar panels on the roof of a normal-sized 
&gt;vehicle.  Even a 96V bus will need about 250 individual cells and there 
&gt;just isn't room for that many on the roof.  I suppose an array the size of 
&gt;the largest full-length bus roofrack I have ever seen would come close, 
&gt;and you would need an array that size to even make a dent in the power 
&gt;consumption of the vehicle on the clearest summer day.  I hate to say it, 
&gt;but photovoltaics on cars are just not going to be practical until they 
&gt;get the efficiency from the current ~15% up to something more reasonable 
&gt;like 50%.  What would be really nice would be if they could come up with 
&gt;translucent cells that could be embedded in window glass and function as 
&gt;window tint at the same time - but I'm really dreaming now.

Well now I meant that the radio might play tunes for an extra day because 
who could drive without tunes??

&lt;grin&gt;

Of course we'd still be driving without heat...

They have designed roofing shingles that act as solar cells. NICE.

You've probably thought alot about this - more than I have. Great facts! 
Thanks!
