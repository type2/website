Subject: RE: [T2] Nashville bus available

Yea the engine was &quot;new&quot; in 1998 when it was put in but I bet it has more 
than 3K on it - she drove it for a few more years after that until it 
developed starting problems.

I looked at that one with 500 cash in my pocket and I didn't think it was 
worth it. Nice camper interior, engine is single port and seems ok - got it 
to run. (Have to whack starter sylonoid) This bus has sat for a long time 
and is pretty crusty on the bottom and sides - it's worth 800 to someone out 
there.

It needs new tires cuz the ones on it are rotted out - it is not a roller 
two tires are down and the other are questionable. Sure it's ready to go 
camping it you park it in your yard. Has some electrical issues and probably 
needs the standard brake work after a bus has been sitting.

If anyone wants to buy and part it I'd like the transmission if it's for a 
reasonable amount - otherwise I'll keep saving for a rebuilt. (I'm in 
Nashville)
