Subject: RE:[T2] if you were/are a mechanic, would it bother you????

if you have in mind a desire to pay-learn with a mechanic, i recommend
checking out san francisco auto repair. they have a great attitude with
beginner and experienced wrenchies. not that you can peer over their
shoulder (on your first visit). but they have two great things that apply
here: 1) they provide inexpensive evening classes in small groups on
tune-up, brakes, and general understanding of air-cooled vw's, and; 2) lend
tools and a flat surface to work on your vehicle for next to nothing. i
hung out there in the early 90's when i either lived on a hill, or worse.
visitors to the city should know about them too. dead-head sensitive owner
and staff. several girl mechanics and instructors. very guru, kine, and
crunchy.
