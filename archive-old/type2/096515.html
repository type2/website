&gt; While contemplating how I might win favor with the Wet Westies List, I
&gt; pondered various upcoming VW events, potential trip reports; I fell into
&gt; a quandary so I just quit thinking about it.
&gt; I continued on with tearing down my most recent Type IV engine and
&gt; performing a careful examination to discover the cause of failure.
&gt; I carefully cleaned all the pistons as I got the set off, started
&gt; cleaning the crankcase and finally split the case to find a pinched

&lt;snip for brevity&gt;


&gt; Then it hit me, an epiphany.
&gt; Truly genius.
&gt; I'll write a trip report about living in my Westy for the next three
&gt; weeks, that will please the Wet Westies group.
