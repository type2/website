Subject: Re: [T2] Shift rod bushings

high Shad  if you are just changing the rear coupler no you dont nee to drop the engine...
  if you are changing the shift rod bushings inside the tube ues you have to drop engine...
  i woudlnt personally do that though..
   
  when i did mine i did the front shift rod bushing located inside the skid plate in the front of bus....under the shift rod.....
  my shift rod plate under shifter was broken also so i got someone to get me another one and I replaced it...
   
   wonderful improvement changing out just the front shift rod bushing as well as the rear coupler....
   
  good luck...

  Hi All,

According to the Hayes that came with the '77 bus, it's necessary to 
drop the engine/transmission just to change the rear shift rod bushing. 

Is that the only way, or is there a method I can use that doesn't 
involve investing so much time and effort? 

I hate sloppy shifting.
