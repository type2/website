Chuck Shultz sends:

&gt; My buddy mail-ordered a gas tank for his Bug and it arrived with a
&gt; questionable paintjob.  It was a bit tacky on the outside and somewhat
&gt; smudgeable, and tackier and wetter (almost like petroleum jelly) and makes
&gt; your fingertip black when you probe around inside the filler hole.

e) This is Cosmoline, and if it wasn't on there your tank would have arrived
as a rusty lump. Kerosene should dissolve it, then Marine Clean, then U.S.
Standard Fuel Tank Sealer for rustproofing. I know John at aircooled_dot_net has
it (it being U.S. Standard, not Cosmoline), I think Ron Salmon at Bus Depot
does too, and RMMW used to have it but I don't know anymore.
