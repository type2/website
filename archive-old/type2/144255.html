Subject: Re: [T2] ignition switch part #

Richard,

Not to be dense, but this is the part, not the lock cylinder or anything else
labeled &quot;ignition&quot;

or,

This is what's being replaced on the web page you're mirroring from (D.
Schwarze?) somebody else on replacing the switch?

Is it the only thing I should replace while in there, beside the tamper proof
bolt?

&gt; This number is from another model that has superceeded the original
&gt; 111-906-865L.

&gt; Probably stands for Meyle. I know that one is all white and one is
&gt; white/black. I think it's the latter switch that's less good.

Meyle is right, there's no pictures of the swithes on the BD site, is the
better one the one that is 6 bucks rather than 5?

Billy
