sounds like you need to
replace the shift linkage bushings
they're not too expensive
but the rear is a real bitch to get on/off
you should replace both front and rear wile you have the shifter disconne=
cted

Hiya listies...

Gear problems...

I have recently bought a T2, 1600, 1976, and I am having some stress with
the gears.

First and Second gear are hard to get into, but with a little practice an=
d
patience they will 'normally' go in... third and fourth are never a probl=
em.

However after a 50mile motorway trip, the gears became significantly wors=
e,
with first and second nearly impossible to get... I attribute (perhaps
incorrectly) this to the temperature ??

In the morning the gears were back to the normal - difficult, but drivabl=
e
state.

Any ideas?
Is this likely to be a gearbox on last legs? or linkages? or could it jus=
t
be in need of an oil change?


thanks in advance

Andi
