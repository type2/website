Talking about a different device.  Not smog pump.  Enginaire is a
proprietary device that allows one cylinder of a multi-cylinder engine to
provide compressed air.

&gt;&gt;My original '73 engine had an air pump.  It was used in the
&gt;&gt;emissions equipment to help the exhaust afterburner work.
&gt;&gt;In so many words it was a smog pump - not much good for pumping
&gt;&gt;up a flat tire.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Good grief, all this chat about the lazy man's way to fix a flat!
&gt;&gt;I say just carry two spare tires and a bike pump just in case.
