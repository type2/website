Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps/A Long Rant

Well I have been of the opinion that over 250 is way to hot.
BUT
My friend who had driven his bus everywhere possible always said to me:
&quot;The WORST thing you have ever done to your bus is intall that damn oil temp 
guage.
You watch it like a hawk and then you worry. I never put one in mine and I 
never
will&quot;.

Maybe he was right.

Dont flame, just think about it. He took his bus and drove it whereever he 
wanted
to and it just worked, Sure he watched for a thrown fan belt, signaled by 
the
gen light comming on, and watched for low oil but he drove and he was happy.
I worried all the time, and I still do.

Jason
