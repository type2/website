Subject: [T2] Windshield fog - a question for the cold weather volks

Morning,

I was driving around in my '79 Baywindow last night and I encountered a 
situation that I thought I might be able to get some advice from you all on. 
  My problem was that I could barely see out the window due to steam from my 
mouth I suppose inside the bus.  I tried just wiping it off with my sleeve 
but it didn't work very well.  As I live in the northern Utah and it is 
purty cold up here I was wondering if putting a coat of that invisible 
windshield stuff on the inside of the windshield would help?  Anyone find an 
inventive way to combat this problem.  It takes a while for the old bus to 
heat up but her heater works pretty well when she does.  I just put new door 
seals around the driver door and I think I need to fix the seal aroung the 
vent window.  It would be nice if I could see now.

Thanks for your input.
