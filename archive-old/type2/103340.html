Subject: Oil Temp

Hi Folks,

I've been running my Raby 2.0 FI engine with Mobil 1 since it was broken in; 
15W-50 in the summer, and 10W-40 in the winter.  When I was in Colorado, I 
saw engine temps in the summer regularly around 230-250 and winter temps 
around 180-210, regardless of what kind of load.  Typical to all aircooled 
engines, going uphill made higher temps and going downhill made lower temps. 
  Now that I'm in North Carolina, I haven't seen engine temps above 180 -- 
even when going uphill with almost 1,000 pounds of gear.  This summer I 
expect to see oil temps around 210-230 at the most, given the higher ambient 
temp.  I think the denser low-altitude air makes for more efficient cooling, 
and that helps oil temps a lot.

I read somewhere that 250 was too hot, but I'm pretty sure that's for dino 
oil.  I think synthetic resists thermal breakdown up to 275 or 280, and 
that's more than enough for our engines -- at oil temps that high, the heads 
will burn up before the main bearings sieze.

As always, YMMV.  Good luck!
