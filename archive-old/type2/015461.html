It is my experience that you can get lifetime warrenties on junk parts that
you will need if you want to pay the frieght, and on quality parts in which
case you don't need a warrenty even if one is offered, as long as you
install it properly. Consistant, no hassle dealings and fast delivery are
worth at least a 10 to 20% price premium in my book. I choose parts by
quality and reputation of the manufacturer first, integrity and reputation
of the vendor second, and consider price of a genuine part incidental. No
price is cheap enough if the part does not arrive as stated and ordered,
fit up properly and function as intended for a long service life. Cost to
get results is how true value must be measured, not parts price.

Fill a semi-trailor with junk parts. Drive it to me and attempt to give it
to me gratis. I will not sign for it or receive it, even though I know with
a few hours of effort I could get several grand for it on ebay. I don't
market heroin or crack either for the same reason. I don't feel it would be
good for SOCIETY for me to do so, despite any windfall. How do you sell
specious parts at a discount?? Offering a lifetime warrenty is a typical
technique. Always claim that they meet original equipment specifications,
regardless the truth is another. Note the VW dealer parts are typically 6
mo. 6k mile warrenty, and will outlast any discount wannabe aftermarket
imitation three or five to one.

Something an early mentor said to me when I was 21 or so. If you haven't
got the time to do it right the first time, where will you find the time to
do it over. He was a hell-of-a fine practical engineer from WaZoo (WSU).
Since that time I have discovered that Einstein proved that time=money².
Ergo, if you haven't got the time/money to do it right the first time,
where will you find the time/money to do it over, and pay for the tow
and/or the lost time from work or take your most valuable time, time off to
do what you want on the weekend if it happens to be other than re-doing
poor results. 

How long do you want a $$$ per hour mechanic dinkin' with a $10 part? If it
takes him 20 minutes to fit up a junk door handle that takes 5 minutes with
the genuine article and the genuine article will give 15 years heavy use
and take abuse, and the wannabe doesn't really work right from the getgo
and will last maybe a few months or a few years depending upon level of
abuse, what are you going to do? Buy a $15 lifetime wannabe or a $35 real
deal. If it takes a savy, skilled and experienced mechanic 20 minutes, how
long will it take you?? You cifer it out and talk it over with your wallet
and see if you can find any middlin' ground.
