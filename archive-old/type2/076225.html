&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; They do not without major work.  The '68-?73? column is completely
&gt; different from the '?76?-79 column.  The change occurred somewhere
&gt; between, I am not sure where, but I have had a '73 and a '76 and they are
&gt; very diferent.  If you want to know just how much of a bear adapting a
&gt; late column to an early bus is, ask Don Boneau.  I *think* he has the
&gt; column from a late bay all set up and functioning in his early truck by
&gt; now...  Don?  :-)

Yer right, Steve...

It took weeks and many hours of backtracking, and re-reading the Bentley,
and finally got every thing to work.  We installed a '79 steering column
into my '71, because the PO gave it to me when I bought my '71 Crew-Cab. He
had intended installing it at a later time, but ended up selling the whole
shebang to me instead. So it turned into a nightmare of calls to Steve who
took pictures and emailed them to me with instructions and many other
friends help. And one by one, I/We managed to get it all to work with no
jury-rigging. Would I do it again...naw. But I do like the stalk mounted
turn signals. Is it worth the time involved...probably not. And it probably
could be done more easily by someone more inclined than myself. But, don't
pay someone to do it for you, as it could cost a lot in time and money.

But you might have it easier as your year model being closer as an upgrade
should be much simpler.

Good luck if you go for it.
