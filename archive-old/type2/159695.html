Subject: accelerator cable linkage on transmission?

Thanks to all for the help with my questions earlier (re: what do I do now)

I've got one more that I need help with and then I should be back on the 
road (or on the road for the first time really)!!!

I'm trying to replace the accelerator cable on my auto 77 westy.  I'm 
having trouble finding the linkage on the transmission. Does anyone have 
any pics or could anyone help me out? Where should I look? I know I've 
seen it before (when I took the cable off originally (1.5 yrs ago), but 
I've been under the bus for 20 minutes and can't find it!
