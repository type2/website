My '70 is inconsistent.  It does this, but sometimes works to the right,
sometimes to the left.  Can't seem to find a set of circumstance that affect
it either.

Weird.

Volks,

Today I swapped turn signal switches, put in the correct fuse box, and guess
what..................My signals flash in the instrument cluster when i turn
them to the right(up) but flash once and no more on the dash when I go left
(down) ..............I have a good relay, for it works fine internally and
externally when going to the right or on the emergency
lights....................

Any one seen this before?
