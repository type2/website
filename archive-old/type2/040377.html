Shelby,

This would be the best time for you to check the clutch disc, clutch cover,
release bearing, flywheel, and, rear main engine seal.

Do the right thing, this will gratify some people and astonish the rest.

&gt; hey volks,
&gt; well seeing my current state of compression, and a 3
&gt; day weekend coming up, im gonna pull the motor out of
&gt; lizzy.   i should be able to peruse the archives for
&gt; tips on droppin the motor as well as muir et al., but
&gt; i was just curious as to when i have the motor out,
&gt; besides assessing and fixing my current problem, are
&gt; there any other items worth replacing at that time.
&gt; and remember i am just a poor guy dropping my bus
&gt; motor, ie., my wallet is way skinny!   but seriously
&gt; if there is anything i should look for to replace or
&gt; do while it is out, please let me know.
&gt; TIA
