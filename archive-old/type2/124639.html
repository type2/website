Subject: Fw: Engine Rebuild

Hi Rus,

One thing you can do when you get the cylinders off is to look inside the
case at the cam to see whether the surfaces are pitted. This would be one
more piece of information to add to the suggestions already given.

Good luck,
Bill Moon

| Hey everyone,
| I am getting ready to pull the engine out of my 71 bus
| (standard) and while the body work is being done im
| going to rebuild it. I have the how to rebuild your vw
| engine book.......and am reading it........but can
| someone one clue me in as to what i might need to
| replace. I believe the pistons and cylinders.......but
| what else needs to be done besides the usual replacing
| of the wires, coil, condenser, points,
| plugs.......etc.......
| Thanks for all your input.
