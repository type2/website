So I wrote:

Dear John,
I've got a 78 too and have had symptoms a little like yours at times.
Once I had awful rough idle and terrible performance and it turned out
that my air intake manifolds were not securely bolted down to the
heads and thus air was leaking in and I effectively was getting an extremely
lean fuel mix to the cylinders. Tightened bolts and was OK.

ANother time I was vexed by extremely annoying intermittent coughing,
sputtering, dying, power loss, etc. and it turned out to be crap in my
gas tank that was intermittently settling on the &quot;fuel out&quot; hole and starving
me for fuel (then floating away and restoring normal function). 

Another time I poured dirty gas in my car and went through Hell
and about 4 replaced fuel filters before most of the crap worked its 
way through. I used a lot of fuel additives to dry up the water and
changed my fuel filters every tank or two (and found them full of
rusty water and junk).

The real solution to each of the latter two problems was to pull the 
fuel tank and have it derusted by a radiator shop. Problem is, you have to
pull the engine to do it. I heard that it will JUST BARELY come out
if you only remove everything on top of the engine, but that sounds like
almost as much work as dropping the engine.

So my advice to you: Change your fuel filter and check the old one. Does
it have obvious rusty water droplets and / or other big crud in it? If
so a dirty tank may be your problem. 

Check torque on intake manifolds. Maybe inspect your injectors while
you're at it. A gunked up or failing injector could do this too, I 
suppose.

Other potential problems with fuel system (probably less likely than the above):
failing fuel pump, or intermittent power to an OK fuel pump. Failing
double relay (which powers fuel pump), or intermittent power to it.

Good luck, and let me know how it goes,

Surfer Bob
