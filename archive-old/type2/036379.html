Subject: RE: Gas price rip offs

I have to disagree, Dave.  I don't want to start a non-VW flame war, but you
should consider yourself lucky you even paid $.92 a gallon last year.
Prices have been close to $1.50 a gallon here in Seattle for close to 2
years.  I'm sure there are others on this list with more research to support
these arguments, but here's my cut.  I realize that many on this list have
chosen to drive a used car almost exclusively, but we do so with the
knowledge that our car (bug, bus, whatever) has a top end of fuel
efficiency.  And hopefully that was considered upon the purchase of this
auto.  If gas was going to be such a big concern, perhaps you should've
bought an '83 Honda Accord that still gets 35+ mpg on the highway, not the
57 bus that looks beautiful but only gets 18mpg hwy.

But more importantly, why are you outraged at the low prices on a finite
fuel source, that by some estimates based on current consumption rates will
be exhausted in less than 50 years.  I think prices should be even higher
for gasoline than they are.  That would be one encouragement for people to
drive less frequently and/or perhaps think twice before buying that brand
new SUV that should get 40+ mpg city and instead gets only 16 hwy.

The problem runs much deeper into the psyche of Americans than the
ostensible problem of high gas prices.  Change will continue to occur
glacially for auto manufacturers until gas prices do go up, people stop
buying autos that get ridiculously low gas mileages, and auto manufacturers
decide that rich, suburban America demands better fuel economy in their
autos.

Or better yet, continue to encourage and support the production of autos
like the newer Hondas and Toyotas that run partially on electric and
partially on gas. Or press your congressman or senator to fund research into
fuel cells, electric cars, and other self-sustaining types of motor
technology that don't run on a fuel with a finite existence.

Americans whine so much about their high gas prices, when they are some of
the lowest in the world.  And considering the U.S. consumes 40% (last
estimate I heard) of the fossil fuels in the world, but only has 4.5% of the
population, perhaps we should look at ourselves and our consumption habits
and do some reevaluation.  And if people are going to continue with their
current lifestyles and the toys that they entail, then I often wonder how
they can whine about it.

Cheers,

Tom

Is anyone outraged over fuel prices?  Where is the outrage?!?!?

Remember the Gulf War?  Prices rose drastically and we were told that once
it
was over things would be back to normal.  Well, it never happened.   Fast
forward to 1999 and we have the lowest gas prices in many years.  Here in
Florida I was paying $.92 a gallon for reg gas.  Then prices began rising
(&quot;for summer driving&quot;) and we were told they'd lower during the winter.  Ah,
but the heating oil keeps prices up...so they will lower in the spring.  Oh,
but oil companies cut production by 8%.  Hmm, let me do the math.  Prices
have risen 40% higher and production has only been cut by 8%.  I see a
DIRECT
rip off on consumers here.  Doesn't anyone else see this?  Does anybody
care?
Maybe there is no outrage because everyone thinks &quot;what can we do?&quot;  We can
speak out and TRY to make a difference.  Let these companies know that we
see
their scams!
