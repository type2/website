Subject: Rear brake backing plate/bearings...
Date: Mon, 22 Mar 1999 21:17:17 -0800

     Howdy,           George suggested using a little penetrating oil at
the base of the lugs, and at the hub/drum joint to help me get my rear
drum off.  That worked fine, so I was off and running to get into my rear
wheels to replace brake shoes, cylinders, etc.  Went out and got me a
3/4&quot; flex bar and a 1 13/16&quot; socket for the castellated nut.  A couple
days of WD 40 soak and it came off ok too.  So now I've got the drum,
nut, cylinder, and outer oil seal out, and the emerg. brake cable out of
the backing plate.  I've decided to take the backing plate off and clean
it up too, probably even paint the outer part. (any problems with that?) 
The question is: how to get the darned thing off.  Do I knock the backing
plate out and off the dowel pin......will it come? Am I liable to break
something while trying?  I think the dowel pin is the last remaining
stronghold....
        Now, assuming I get it off, clean it up, paint it, or spit shine
it or whatever, I still want to go in and repack my bearings.  Bentley
has me confused (more likely me than him).   In what order do I remove
things. Do I have to remove the bearing housing from the spring arm? 
Must the shock come off?   I've got the outer oil seal off.  I don't see
any circlips anywhere yet......so they must be enroute from the
inside...?  Remove the axle shaft?  Or.....throw in the towel...concede
defeat.  By god, I splurged for the big bar and socket, and I know
someone wants to help walk me through this.
     So....# 1:  How to get that backing plate off...?
             # 2:  How to get at the bearings for inspect, repack, or
replace...?

              Headed to the archives to look again...:-(   Kevin  Snow
