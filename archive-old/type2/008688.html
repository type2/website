 Hi,
	Mine's behind the driver's seat: not ideal for camping but OK
for driving. It's a little difficult to get at but I figure that if I
need it the adrenalin rush will overcome any minor obstacles...
 In my '71 I had it on the driver's B-pillar- easier access from the
interior but I was always a bit worried about it coming adrift in an
accident.
 I think if I was camping more often I'd put a second one in the rear of
the van, probably mounted horizontally (if that's OK) on the outside of
the underbed storage panel.

Cheers,
	W.
