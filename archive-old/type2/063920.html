Subject: Going Cross Country, what to see?  (Was trekking thru NC) 

&gt;ah, the mountains of north carolina. i've been across the united 
&gt;states and have seen many a pretty area. but the north carolina
&gt;mountains are the most pristine in the US, imho. 

This is of interest to me, as my wife and I are about to leave on 
our first cross-country journey, in an 83-1/2 Westy (which Kyle at 
Volks Cafe in Santa Cruz is readying for us as I write this).  We 
have the first leg of the trip planned - Santa Cruz, San Francisco, 
wine country (as per list member H. Steven Dolan's advice), then 
down to LA to visit friends, then Vegas on the way to the Grand 
Canyon, probably down Arizona and into Mexico for a day or two.

Then things begin to get a little sketchy.  We'd like to stop in 
New Orleans on our way back towards home (Phila. area), but haven't 
really decided on what route to take or what to see between Arizona 
and Louisiana, or between Louisiana and Pennsylvania.

Any suggestions from those who have done this before?

Also, would any list members feel like a short visit from a 
relatively young couple passing through in a Vanagon Westy?  It 
would be nice to meet more of the people whose e-mail I read and 
respond to every day, and who will understand the sense of wonder 
and relief behind the words &quot;the bus made it this far.&quot;
