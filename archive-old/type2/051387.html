Subject: [T2] BN4 question

Hello

I have a 72 camper with a late-model BN4 heater. How do I remove the plug? I
don't recall reading that this is particularly difficult, yet it is directly
below the wheel well and I can't see how I can get a spark plug socket onto
it without removing the unit.

Thanks
