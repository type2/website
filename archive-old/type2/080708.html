Subject: Re:Freaky Electrical Problem on '68 Bus

Brett,
    I just saw your post on the type2 list and thought I'd give you a
possible answer.  I looked at the wiring diagram for your 68 bus as I have
my Bentley manual open to the electrical section for my own problems.  You
can find the wiring diagram at
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/Transporter_USA_from_August_1967.jpg
if you don't have a manual with it.  I think the reason that turning your
headlights on and off gets things working is because the headlight switch
( F in the diagram ) is in the main power wire between the battery and both
the ignition switch and the fuse panel.  I'd suggest that you check both
ends of the 3 heavy, red wires on your headlight switch.  Make sure they are
in good condition and that the terminals on the switch and wires are clean
of dirt and oxidation.  If they aren't, fix and clean them until the metal
is clean and bright.  If that doesn't make the problem go away, I'd consider
a new headlight switch.
    I hope that helps.
