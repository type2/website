Subject: Re: heater boxes

I have some heater boxes on my 69 and the arm on the front theat the cables 
hook to seem to be upside down. There is no way that the cables could be hooked 
up. Could these be off of a bug? 
Secondly has anyone had any experience with the SS heater boxes either from the 
RMM catalog or the ones from like Denmark or one of those Scandanavian 
countries (cant remember which one)?
