&quot;Just wanted to speak up for those of us on the lunatic fringe...&quot;  

I'm a card-carrying member!  Cheers...KR

interest, especially the discussion about specific torque numbers for the
lugs. I've owned three Vanagons (two with alloys), and three Bays including
my current daily driver. In all that time, as well as ownership of nearly 30
other vehicles, NEVER have I used any sort of torque wrench in tightening
the lugs. My standard method has always been to snug them down with my
impact on a low setting, and then tighten by hand with a 1/2 drive ratchet
and extension in a criss-cross pattern. I figure anything tightened with a
ratchet can be undone with a ratchet, and I've never had a problem, nor have
I ever even come close to losing a wheel. Never. Why go to the extra hassle
of using a torque wrench? I *do* own one, which has been used for head bolts
and the like, but otherwise I prefer to wing it.

I've had the same experience with CV hex bolts. Never used a torque wrench,
just get them good and tight with a socket. Never any problems with those,
either. I generally just use the size of the bolt head as a guide in
calibrating my arm! Anyway, not trying to discount the value in torquing to
spec. Just wanted to speak up for those of us on the lunatic fringe...
