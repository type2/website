Subject: RE: [T2] Anybody seen this?

&gt;From: &quot;Chris M.&quot;

&gt;So he didn't have a digi-camera for pics but he posted for sale pics? 
&gt;&lt;griN!&gt;

&gt;Send 'em a roll of film, get 'em to send it back and get them developed. 
&gt;Fast film. 400+ ASA.


They even have Digi-Disposables now, he can take pics of the bus have them 
processed in less than an hour. Kodak is magical.

Kodak ... trusted by Abugrave prison guards for memories you don't want to 
forget and for those you do. ;-)
