Dear Perry,

2.0L heads tend to be in short supply. Good ones in even shorter supply.
You might consider using 1800cc heads instead. They will fit on a 2.0L 
engine with no modifications. You lose a bit of displacement, but there 
are more of them out there and it might get you going by your target 
date. 

I've been running 'em on my '78 Riviera ed. Westfalia for 6 years now 
with no real problems. Someday I'd like to get the real 2.0L heads and 
see if I get any more power, but until then I'm quite happy with mine.

Regards,
Surfer Bob
