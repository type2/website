&gt;Q: I installed a fuel pressure regulator on my, ahem, NAPA fuel pump to

What is your fuel pressure after installing the regulator?  You must know 
this before you can rule out excess pressure as a problem.  You can't just 
install parts and ass-u-me they work.

&gt;i noticed someone said there is an adjustment that limits the amount of 
&gt;fuel jetted into the carb intake. is this what i should be attending to, 
&gt;or am i still on the wrong track? any hints here would be appreciated.

They're probably talking about the accelerator pump arm adjustment, but 
that's not going to cause your problem.  Have you looked down the throats 
of the carbs?  Try it with the engine running (carefully) then kill the 
engine while you're watching (remove power to the coil or have someone else 
shut the engine off) and see if there is any fuel dripping/pouring into the 
manifolds.  You can also actuate the throttle a few times and verify that a 
thin stream of fuel shoots into the throat of the carb while the throttle 
is opening.  Once it is all the way open there should not be any more fuel 
flowing.  If fuel dribbles down the inside of the carb from a hole instead 
of shooting out of a small brass-colored L-shaped pipe, then you are 
missing said pipe and this could be part of your problem.  It's common for 
those pipes to fall out.  Regardless, be sure and change your oil 
again.  Gas will dillute your oil and keep it from lubricating your engine 
properly, which will lead to accelerated ring and bearing wear.
