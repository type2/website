Subject: Re: [T2] possible purchase of bus -- first post

--------------0522E7F8399A13B25BA7A1B9

&gt;
&gt; The question I have are: (1)what should I look for on this bus that may
&gt; spell trouble and

The mechanicals, like health of engine, trans, etc, just like any other car
purchase. If you do not have the skills yourself then pay a mechanic familiar
with the T2s to spend an a few hours looking and testing.



&gt; (2) is it priced too high.

Hard to say because we all have our own ideas about money and what things are
worth. I paid $3200 for a 78 westy deluxe in good condition with 130k miles. I
spent $3000 more putting in a new engine, starter, bellows, one flapper box,
minor rust repair, auxiliary oil cooler, new paint on pop top, window and door
rubber, kick panels, alternator, tank sending unit, upholstery, head and oil
temp gauges, tachometer, clutch, and other minor cosmetic things (I'm sure I
forgot some stuff). I did all the work myself (except I bought a long block
from reputable builder) which means I have at least 100 hours invested.  Note
that I have not gone thru the brakes, suspension, etc, which means that the
work and expense are not yet done. I like what I now have and consider the
total expense to be reasonable.

If the bus in question is as good mechanically as it seems to be cosmetically
then $6000 is reasonable. At least to me.

Good luck
Chris
