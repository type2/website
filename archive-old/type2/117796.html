Subject: RE: [T2] Valves

Interesting....as my AVP rebuild(346 miles so far) came with
AMC heads...same brand that aircooled_dot_net offers...may not be the same
exact heads, but same manufacturer.

My AVP rebuild seems to be doing well...no oil leaks after an 85mile run 
at 70-80 mph both ways.

Temperature at the oil filter on both runs was 215 degrees at about
70-80 degrees ambient.

I will be watching to see how AVP handles the return.  


Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; &gt; I just purchased a set of AVP heads a few months
&gt; &gt; ago (June).
&gt; 
&gt; I know nothing about AVP heads, never heard of them,
&gt; but i would say they should stand behind their
&gt; product, seeing how in my opinion it appears a defect.
