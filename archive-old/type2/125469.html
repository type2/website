Subject: Re: [T2] Missing water filler key, 84 Westie

If you were on the East coast, I could help ya.  As I have impressioned keys
for these before. Just drive to your local locksmith and ask him to
impression a key for it.  You will need to remove the lock from the inside I
think. ( I never had to remove or install, I had the people just bring me
the cylinder)  Shouldn't cost $10 or so.  It uses a Master (as in Master
padlocks) keyblank forgot the exact one but it is in the Vanagon archives
somewhere.

Good luck,
Snoopy
