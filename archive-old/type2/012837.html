&gt; Follow up to my knocking noise.

&gt; I drove it home after work and noticed the sound only happened while 
&gt; going over bumps.  luckily!! :)  So at least it is not engine related.  
&gt; I took it home and crawled underneath and grabbed everything I could 
&gt; get my hand on and moved it and pushed it.  NOTHING moved.  nothing 
&gt; seemed loose.  while driving it seemed as I could hear it more while in 
&gt; the car then while sticking my head out the window.  but man, its a 
&gt; loud noise.  not something you have to try to listen to in order to 
&gt; hear it.
&gt;
&gt; So I guess....CV Boots, Bad Shock(does anyone know what kind of symptom 
&gt; that would produce?), or engine mounts are loose but I dont think its 
&gt; that.

a shock makes a really loud *clunk* sound when you go over bumps if the 
rubber grommet between the
shock and the mounting stud has moved or fallen out.

To check, get under the bus and just look and see if any points where 
the front shocks mount is
just a ring of metal (the shock part) around a metal stud which may or 
may not have a rubber
grommet also on the stud pushed to the side.
