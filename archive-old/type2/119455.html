&gt;I installed a bilge blower (along with new heater pipe and insulation)

&gt;plastic bilge blower melted into one big lump not letting any heat
&gt;through at all. And that happened when we really needed heat ...

I've read about this situation several times in the archives and it seems it's a fix that only addresses the symptom (with negative results!)

After taking out my engine, examining the exhaust and checking the ductwork there are so places that heat can escape I feel they need to be addressed first before attempting modifications. I colored this diagram a while back to explain where the losses can occur:
