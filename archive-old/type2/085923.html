Subject: Re: [T2] Testing the double relay.

Matt,

Think of the two relays as the power latch and the pump. pin 85 is the 
common(ground) for both relays.

12 V applied to 86 or 86a or 88a should energize the pump relay ( 88y is 
closed to 88d and 88c). 88d and 88c are tied together.

12V applied to 86c should energize the latch relay (close 88z to 88b and 
88a) 88b and 88a are tied together.

In the run state both relay are energized. the latch is held on by the 
ignition on switch. The pump is held on by the combination of the latch 
relay and the closed switch in the air flow box (pins 36 and 39).

Can't send schematic as my scanner is down.

&gt;
&gt;Can anyone tell me how to test the double relay? I am having trouble
&gt;understanding it's layout and my manual does not go into detail on it. Does
&gt;anybody have a schematic?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
