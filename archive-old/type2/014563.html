Hey ya'll... my 82 westie, which usually (after 2 heads and 2 p &amp; c's)
runs smooth as glass, over the last few trips has developed a very
slight hiccup/miss at highway speed.  It's only one little catch, but I
tend to get fussy about those things in my van.  It also occasionally
dies when I come to a stop after being at higher rpm, like the stop sign
coming off the highway.  It will restart, but may die again when I put
it in gear to drive off.  Seems to get back to normal if I rev it up
after restart.  I guess I'll change the fuel filter, and a good tune-up
even thought it's not ready for it milage wise.  Couldn't hurt...  just
thought maybe someone on the list could guess what's causing this tiny
tweak in my smooth 2L.

BTW- anyone got a gas cap they wanna sell me? The gas pump gnomes stole
another one...
