Subject: RE: [T2] 68--To 79 Type 2 &amp; Vanagon Westfalia Accessory Window
  AC Unit

In this case, I have some design ideas too--
And they do include a tray type set up--but instead of taking the
support legs to the door--have telescoping/ adjustable legs to the
ground to support the AC unit.

I woud sure hate to put a load in the middle of the door and put a dent
in it or cave it in.

Simple.

Later,

Terry

68--To 79 Type 2 &amp; Vanagon Westfalia Accessory Window AC Unit 

I love the boot, that is much better than fabricating something heavy to
put around the ac unit. The mounting is also very slick and easy to
store. 
Have any suggestions for mounting on a 73 Westy that does not have the
luggage rack in the front? 
I was thinking of a tray the hooked onto the door at the bottom of the
window. This tray would hold the ac unit. Under the tray have some
support legs that got straight down the door, padded of course. I am not
sure of the length to stop the door from being dented by the weight.
Storing this would be somewhat of a pain unless collapsible. Just some
thoughts I am still trying to work out in my head. 
I will not have time to try until next summer. I am to busy trying to
get this gas heater installed and saving up $1300 for a new complete AC
system for the bus. Anybody ever use a system from Gilmore Enterprises?
they make complete kits for bugs, and busses. They are just finishing up
the mounting bracket for the T4 engine. The kit comes with everything,
even the under dash blower for $1300. What about other systems, anybody
ever get a kit from somebody else? How do you like it?
