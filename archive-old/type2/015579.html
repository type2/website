Subject: Fuel gauges
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi Volks,

The recent gauges discussion got me thinking about the annoying
habit my fuel gauge has which I've been putting up with for a
while but I really should get sorted out.

When I first aquired my '76 Double Cab,just over 10 years ago
now,the fuel gauge would only ever read up to about the 1/4
mark when the tank was full then within a hundered kms or so,
dissappear off the gauge.

Tried new sender,made no difference.Had a spare instrument
clusted so swapped them over and now had a reliable fuel gauge,
...well,as accurate as they ever were.Never did really get to
the bottom of the root cause however...

All went well 'till a few months back when the current gauge developed
a mind of it's own.It has moments of lucidity when it will still
give an reasonable indication of fuel level,usually only when
I first start the truck but as you drive along,the needle starts
dropping and if the tank is half full or less,it starts to dissappear
again off the gauge.Also when I have a full tank of fuel,and turn
the ignition back on,the needle will jump about several times as it
attempts to pass the 1/4 mark before actually succeeding.

Given my problems are similar to what I experienced once before
and swapping sender units made no difference,could the voltage
stabilizer unit going kaput be likely to produce symptoms similar
to those I am experiencing?

Any insights appreciated,
