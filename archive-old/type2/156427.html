&gt; Does anyone have a source for the ground connector

&gt; wires to hook to.  

Do you require original equipment? I have collected
stuff like that from electronic stores and electronic
surplus stores. If &quot;anything&quot; will work for you, I
might have something... I'll look around the junk
bins. -BaH
