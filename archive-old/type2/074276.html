Subject: starting problems...

Sorry about the long post but perhaps the extra info will help in making =
suggestions. I recently built an engine for my 71 bus (90.5s, 78 stroke, =
44 heads, kadrons) with all new parts. 95% of this engine is brand =
spankin new. A few weeks ago I was finally able to put the darn thing =
in, I went to turn the key, with the plugs out so I could prime it, and =
nothing. Luckily my dad has owned a bus in teh past so he had me =
underneath, pounding on the solenoid. This worked in allowing it to turn =
over and it turns like a champ with a new battery and now a rebuilt =
starter/solenoid. Here is where the problems come in. Whenn the plugs go =
back in, and I go to turn it over, it will only turn over a couple of =
times, sort of a whump-whump-whump. It is almost like it can't overcome =
the compression or something, but I have .090 spacers on it and the =
compression is only set to about 7.3. I am going to put in a new =
ignition switch but I don't have a whole lot of hope that this will do =
the trick. I am perplexed to say the least. I don't think it is fuel =
delivery or anything because I am not getting that far. Any help would =
be awesome as my FLAPS has proved useless. If anyone saw a similar post =
to this on the volkswebbin site, yes this is the same best of burden, =
but I have been on vacation. For the love of all that is sacred, help me =
before I take a hammer to this thing. Thanks.
