Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus automatic Transmission rebuild kit?

you got lucky the early bus 003 auto transmission rebuild parts have
generally been unavaliable for some time.   the later 010 auto tranny
parts are still avaliable.

&gt; I'm going to do it anyway.  I installed a bigger engine and I want the
&gt; trans to be
&gt; in the best shape possible (subaru EA81 + 1987 SPFI)

personally I would try to chase down the later 010 auto tranny used from
75 to 79 and also used on other VW and Audi's.  the 003 tranny uses vacuum
as part of the shift system, where will you get the correct vacuum on your
new engine.

&gt; Are there better prices ($199 seems like a pretty good deal to me)
&gt; Are there better parts to buy?  Anyone have experience with rebuilding
&gt; the automatics, and opinions of which parts are best?

you will need an ULTRA clean place to do the work.

&gt; Am I going to need special tools?  I have the VW instruction/service manual,

yes there are a number of tools you will likely need.  	 personally would
not do this unless it were a spare tranny or was broken..

&gt; but I haven't looked at it closely yet.  It has good pictures and
&gt; rebuild instructions,
&gt; I'm just wondering what tips and tricks you (type2 mailing list subcriber) have.
&gt; Rich

have your sanity checked????  it is not impossible but unless you are a
glutton for punishment or want to become an auto tranny mechanic why
bother??

the 010 tranny is reasonably avaliable and is a better tranny, if I wanted
to spend $200 I would search out an 010 tranny (you should be able to find
a good one for less than $250) and it is almost a bolt on swap, get the
cable linkage and you have everything you need.
