Subject: RE: [T2] Hybridizing the T2 (was Annual smog checks)

From what I understand, hydrogen injection is sort of like a supercharger
system which relies on the engine to provide additional boost. They both use
belts to turn a device that produced drag and boost or electrical. But of
course a supercharger is like robbing peter of his coin purse to pay Paul
for the Starship Enterprise. The payoff is huge (proportionally speaking).

For the hydrogen injection system; I have read a few folks using a
combination of an alternator and a geared alternator that runs off the
braking system to charge a capacitor and a low yield l-ion storage system.
Not free, but at least it is moving in the right direction.

What is the acceptable efficiency ratio for this type of augmentation to be
relevant? My engineering education isn't formal. Most of it I pieced
together off the back of sugar packets. :)

Like most devices of this kind, the web site is a bit vague about how the
thing actually works.  Reading between the lines, it appears that the
device uses electricity from the vehicle to perform electrolysis on the
water, yielding hydrogen and oxygen that are conducted to the manifold to
be burned by the engine.

Not a bad idea, but the energy for the electrolysis has to come from
somewhere and the process cannot return more than that amount of energy
when the hydrogen and oxygen are recombined.  The returned energy will
actually be less because no process is 100% efficient.

Now, if they were using a large solar array to run the generator and then
burning the hydrogen the approach might be a way to get &quot;free&quot; energy.
However, using the alternator of the vehicle to supply energy is just
robbing Peter to pay Paul.
