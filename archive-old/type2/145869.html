&gt; Ever had a beer can chicken dinner? Seriously, people cook whole chickens
&gt; with a beer can in the cavity. You pop the top sit the chicken upright in a
&gt; pan and roast it in the oven, or on the BBQ. Makes the meat really moist and
&gt; juicey. So there you go, we DO add beer. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;    Ripcord the other five cans from the six pack and the chicken is 
superfluous...;-)
