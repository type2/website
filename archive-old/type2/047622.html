&gt; Avoid any tire store that doesn't tighten your lug nuts with a torque
&gt; wrench, using factory specified torque values.  And you shouldn't have to
&gt; ask, it should be their standard procedure.

I've never seen a tire store yet that uses a torque wrench!  I count
myself lucky if I can flag the guy down before he tightens them with an
impact wrench!

For this reason, I seldom take a vehicle to the tire store.  I take them
loose wheels.  this also gives me the opportunity to clean and paint the
wheels and to inspect the brakes before I tighten my own lug nuts by hand.
