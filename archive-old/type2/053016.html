Ladies and Gentlemen,

First, the cop/helpfulness thread is now killed.

Secondly, let's have a quick review of the list rules, shall we?  The list
charter, which you all automatically received when you subscribed, clearly
states that even on Friday, all messages must have Bus content.  This list
is not a chat room.  If you want a chat room, get on mIRC, go to
irc.type2_dot_com and join #buslist and chat all you want.

This list is about Buses and only Buses.  If it doesn't have to do with
Buses, don't post it.  This is very simple and I just can't understand why
it's such a problem.  Don't post Bug stuff.  Don't post Sprite stuff.  Don't
post cop stuff.  Don't post civil rights stuff.  Just post Bus stuff.  Easy.

Like it or not, this is the way of the list.  If you can't abide by the
rules, then go find another list.  In case you were wondering, no, the list
is not a democracy.

Meanwhile, back in the jungle, Ken is revising the list charter to include
some more goodies and when the revision process is completed it will be
posted for all to read, save, and refer to before posting questionable
stuff.

If you think I am a hardass, I don't care.  If you want me to lighten up,
good for you.  I figure if I'm not pissing at least a couple people off, I'm
not doing my job right.  Thankfully the vast majority of e-mail I get
regarding admin posts is supportive so I'll take that as a good sign.

Thank you and have a nice day.
