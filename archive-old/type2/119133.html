Subject: Exhaust conversion

Im considering doing the well talked of 72-74 exhaust conversion. Right now I have the 79 Calif exhaust system. Ive been trying to locate an uncut left Cal heat exchanger but it doesnt look like Im going to find one. So here is what Im thinking. Leaving the right heat exchanger in place and removing everything else (muffler, cross over pipe, left heat exchanger). Then installing a left 
72-74 heat exchanger and buying a new muffler that was used on 72-74 buses.
I dont live in California so there is no need for the CAT.

Now originally I thought the 79 and 72-74 exhaust were both square port at the
cylinder heads but I now discovered the 72-78 are oval port...

This article is doing well at confusing me. http://www.type2_dot_com/library/exhaust/exhperm.htm

I find it hard to believe that the square port will fit into the round port hole and make tight seal. Has anyone done what Im considering or have a recommendation.

Im still holding out hope on finding a uncut 79 Left Calif heat exchanger, if you have one for sale Im interested
