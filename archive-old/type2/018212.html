Subject: Removing stickers / exhaust
Message-ID: &lt;374DA69C.C9DACD08_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

The PO of my 72 Adventure Camper was a serious Deadhead, and the bus is
covered in all kinds of stickers.  Unfortunately, several of them are
stuck directly on the paint of the rear hatch and engine compartment
lid.  Anyone got any recommendations on how to remove these stickers
without damaging the paint?  I was hoping there is some kind of magic
solvent that will take the stickers off, but leave the paint unharmed. 
The PO also &quot;played for the other team&quot; so to speak, so I really would
like to get these rainbow stickers off my camper.

Also, in my 71 bus, I have massive exhaust leaks.  The damn thing sounds
like a Harley. ;)
The muffler (last replaced 4 years ago) and the heat exchangers (never
replaced) are rusted badly.  In the 8 years I have owned that bus, the
heat has never worked.  Turn on the heat, and you got exhaust in the
cab.  I am getting sllleeeeeeeppppyyyy.  Well, living is So Cal, I can
live without the heat, but the noise is starting to bother me.  Since I
don't need heat, an extractor seems the way to go.  But after reading
the Hoover Sermons, Bob seems really against extractors.  I really don't
want to spend the big money for a pair of heat exchangers when I don't
need the heat.  Also, I hear those Brazillian ones don't last.

What are my other options?  Is there some kind of item that I can use to
replace the heat exchangers and still use the stock exhaust?  Bob only
mentions not liking the &quot;cheap&quot; extractors.  Are there good extractors? 
The only ones I have seen are what RMMW carries.

Thanks for the help,
