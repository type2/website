Don't panic!
Goto the local hardway store and buy a length of (i think it's) 5/16 rod.  
Make sure you have a 5/16 drill bit.  A good one.  Prelube the screws 
holding the lid in place with WD40.  Carefully remove the screws.  Remove 
the hinges.  Put the hinge in a vise.  CAREFULLY drill the old hinges out.  
MAINTAIN a straight shot in.  Works better if you have access to a drill 
press (there's 1 at my house if ya wanna come use it this weekend).  test 
fit the rod in the hinge.  Should be a tight fit.  Grease well, put rod in 
hinge, cut off excess, leaving about 1/8&quot; on each side.  Carefully slot the 
extra with a hacksaw.  Expand the slotted part with blows from a precision 
instrument such as a hammer and chisel.

Pizza cake!
