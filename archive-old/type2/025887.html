Thus spoke Dan of vw_bus_74_at_yahoo_dot_com on 5/15/01 3:51 PM:

&gt; So has anyone manufactured a westy style wood headliner?
&gt; If so I could use some tips on how to cut and bend the
&gt; headliner wood to fit the complex curves found in the
&gt; front and back of the bus.

The rear ceiling panel from a 70 Sportsmobile, flattened out measures:
Front:  52 3/4&quot;
Back:   52&quot;
Sides:  47 1/2&quot;

Funny you should ask.

I've been in the process (for the last 2 years) of replacing Phrogbus's 30
year old liner (made out of fiberboard) with birch plywood. The old one has
sat outside for a while and now looks worse than ever. It's also warped.
Anyway, I'm trying to clean-up the backyard for Ari's birthday party and I
intend on finally throwing it away but first I wanted its dimensions. So
last weekend, I straightened it out and measured it.

My big fear is that I will lose the dimensions so I wanted a copy in the
archives and your post gives me an excuse to place them there.

I beleive that there are previous posts regarding something called baltic
birch which is sold in a metric size which is wider than the 48&quot; inch sheets
available at the Home Despot. If you use the 1/8&quot; stuff, it's flexible
enough to conform to the curve.

Hope this helps,
