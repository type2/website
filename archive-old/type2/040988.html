The Pumpkin is alive and well, and thanks to Dave Schwarze, has  a decent set of
heater boxes - thank you! Anyway,
while waiting for my new shocks and wheel bearings to arrive, I'm test riding
and trouble-shooting the motor. I'm not
familiar with dual carbs to say the least, and just picked up a sych tool. The
motor/Trans I installed is an 1800 from a 74
bus. the carbs had already been de-emissionized (plugged and sealed in various
ways) However I left the one piece metal
tube which connects to the inner side of the left hand carb and the inner side
of both manifolds. It has a port under the air cleaner that I'm thinking of
running the brake servo hose off. Not sure if it is an appropriate place.
Anyway, The van runs
smoothly off the line on level ground up through the gears. (compression Test:
#1: 115, #2: 135, #3 135 and #4: 115), however
on the hills and under load it craps out in the top of 3rd gear. By crapping out
I mean the RPMs drop to just above idle - maybe 2000 rpm, but the gas pedal is
totally unresponsive. It chugs along like that at about 10 mph, I get back to
level ground, put it back and first and again proceed through the gears no
problem. Hills no go, level ground okay. Any comments
appreciated. I'm about to put on my gas mask and football helmet, grab the sych
tool and haynes, assorted screwdrivers and get back there and try adjusting the
problem away.
