Kelly:
What Jerry did was probably as close to perfect as justice usually gets. At
least the guy feels like the fool that he is! Nobody should probably get shot
over an emblem. I've lost 2 and got one back!
Now back to the obligatory bus content:
Many years ago my brother built a beautiful bus tow bar. Started with a bolt
together bug one, lengthened it about a foot, put an X-member in it, cut the
brackets and rewelded to fit the larger diameter bus axle tube. Seems like
there were springs on it somewhere to slightly absorb the shock, too. This
tow bar was stolen from the front of my 58 deluxe clear back about 1985. I
realize it's a long shot, but has anyone ever seen it? I'd sure like to get
it back! I'd even pay a reasonable finder's fee not to exceed its market
value. Whoever has it now probably is NOT who stole it. 16 years is a long
time for a hot tow bar to cool off!
This was taken in Waterloo, Iowa about 1985, so it's probably still in Iowa,
but you never know! Mostly sentimental value, but a bus tow bar sure would be
handy.
