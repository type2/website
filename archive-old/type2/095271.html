I guess without having a liner to prevent this(as you do in a home) could 
present you with the opportunity to own your own schwimmwagon. :^)

&gt;
&gt;IF there was anyway to keep it sliding forward off of the perch of the rear
&gt;bed and slamming into the rear of the front seats and then bursting
&gt;flooding the front of the bus.
&gt;
&gt;I imagine the car next to this bus staring at the driver and passenger
&gt;inside the flooded cab, water over the front windows, gropping for the door
&gt;handle...
&gt;
&gt;Wonder how bad that would swell out the nose - probably would look like a
&gt;VW bus with a bee sting right on the nose...
&gt;
&gt;Bet a bus like that would go cheap.....
&gt;
&gt;Air mattresses are alot cheaper...
&gt;
&gt;&lt;grin&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Apart from bursting, the other thing about not driving with
&gt;&gt;it would be its effect on weight distribution. As a floating
&gt;&gt;mass it would shift forward as you brake increasing the
&gt;&gt;likelyhood of lockup, and it would probably effect your
&gt;&gt;cornering as well.
&gt;
&gt;Ciao!
