&gt;I have a 70 bus w/a rebuilt (by me) 1600cc single-port.  Recently, it has 
&gt;been difficult to start when its cold (sitting overnight - overnight temps 
&gt;appox 35F).  It doesn't matter if I try to start it in the morning or in 
&gt;the afternoon.  Usually it takes 2-3 tries to get it to fire, then 
&gt;die,  then another couple tries after that.  After it has started, I have 
&gt;to keep my foot lightly on the accelerator pedal for a few minutes until I 
&gt;can release it to complete its warm up.  I have a new carb, a 32 Pict 3, I 
&gt;believe, along with the rebuild.

Two issues here, battery+starter and carb+choke+fuel delivery+spark.
ANY slowness in the turning of the starter can probably be blamed on a weak
battery--cold weather is when this makes itself known.  Time to check
your battery, no matter how new it might be.  Harbor Freight sells a nice
load tester.

Your main problem seems to be a choke issue.  Have you adjusted the auto
choke for the winter?  I adjust the auto choke so that the choke plate is just
barely closed, on a cold morning.  In the summer I re-adjust them looser.
Be mindful that any timing/ignition issues are liable to show themselves 
more in the
cold.  A complete tune-up, and oil change to a lighter oil, are good 
winterizing measures.
