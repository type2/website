hi Volks
This may be  a really stupid question....but maybe not.  Anyway...we are
trying to replace the brake shoes on our 1968 Transporter.....neither one of
us have ever attempted this before on a VW so we are stumped. So far, we
have the dust cover off the front right side and....oh...thats our
problem....the nut on the spindle that is attached by a hex bolt...how do I
get that off???  do I take that off ???  I think we can handle it once we
tackle this drum removal We are using Chiltons and The Idiots Guide (how
appropriate :-}&gt;)

PLEASE HELP&gt;&gt;&gt;WE ARE STUMPED!!!!
Peace Love and Happiness
Chance and Amy
