Subject: Re: rear s belts question
To: type2-digest_at_lenti.type2_dot_com, devans_at_hometech_dot_org

I got a partial set of rear seat belts from Dan Evans (Dan, if you read this, 
fear not, your reimbursement is on it's way along with another tape -- any 
requests?).

I cleaned 'em up with ammonia and cleaner and they became supple right away.  
They are not all identical, and so are designed to mount in different places 
in the back.  I've got some of them on, and it really makes a difference 
(thanks, Dan -- Emma thanks you too!)  The other ones I had were for a 
standard transporter and were way too short.

How does the buckle part for the sitzback (rear-facing seat) mount?  I've 
looked all over, but cannot find a mounting bolt similar to the ones under 
the folding bed.  Also, it seems that the buckle part would have to be longer 
then those that go under the folding bed, or else it won't reach (if indeed, 
it DOES mount to the floor, which it seems like it should).

Anyone out there know how this particular part mounts?  Do I need a longer 
belt with buckle?  Dan could not be sure, since he shipped enough for only 
two belts.  He was able to help, however, with what belt goes where.  Dan, if 
you can send me the other pieces, I can send you another tape (along with 
postage), if you feel that is a fair trade.
