Kenny,

GET A MANUAL

But we'll let you off, just this once 8-)

Pancake engine, right?  Go under your bus, take the right hand side
cylinder cover tin off, your thermostat lives in there.  Looks like a
squirrel's accordion.
(Whaddya mean, you've never seen a squirrel playing an accordion, they
all have them round here.)
