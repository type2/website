Greetings list....


  Well, I spent all weekend pulling, fixing, and reinstalling the motor in
the Great Pumpkin so I didn't get to read the list until this morning. To
say I was surprized about Bob Hoovers decision to drop his sermons is an
understatement!!!!

  I happened across the archives and sermons about 2 years ago and that
rekindled my desire to obtain a new bus. Reading on his methodes, his road
trips, and how to modify VW's was an inspiration, I will really miss them.

  Bob, if you are reading this, you are without a doubt the most
knowledgeable Type2 person I've seen. I know first hand about how people
can be real jerks and bring any desire to help to an abrupt halt. On a
newsgroup I used to belong on, the original purpose of the group was
overtaken by a bunch of what I suspect a group of bored kids. I think that
you will find a whole lot of good folks on this list and I, like most who
appriciate your sermons, failed to properly thank you. If you decide to
publish a CD, count me in for a purchase!!
