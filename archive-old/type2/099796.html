&gt;Now, what I asked, is regarding the

Oh please.  While it's true that the rod bearings are slightly larger in the 1800, they are not any more &quot;heavy duty&quot; than the ones in the 2-liter.  Think of it this way - the 1800 rod bearings are Lennox Lewis and the 2000 rod bearings are Mike Tyson.  True, Lewis is tougher than Tyson but Tyson is still good enough to whup 99.99% of the people on this planet, and that's &quot;good enough&quot;.  The 2000 rod bearings are also &quot;good enough&quot; - I'd think a guy with 240k miles on a set of 2000 rod bearings would agree.  :)

&gt;and he thinks the 77 afm/ecu will simply note how much air the
&gt;smaller engine is drawing and give the correct gas for from the injectors?

Sounds reasonable to me.
