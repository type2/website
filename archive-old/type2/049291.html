Subject: [T2] Breather box

Hello

I am wondering if there is supposed to be some kind of element inside the
breather box of my '72 Wesfalia. I was surprised to inspect mine and find
none. Also, why are there two holes in the bottom of the box, one
appoximately one inch in diameter, the other approximately 1/2&quot; in diameter?
Finally, a few weeks ago there was a string regarding the gooey stuff that
accumulates here and there because of moisture in the crankcase. Can someone
tell me the subject of that string, maybe send it to me?

Thanks

Rich Patano,
