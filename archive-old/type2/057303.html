Gee, that's a bummer. I only just started reading them, and found
some really interesting information there. Bob, if you're reading this,
I urge you to reconsider. Or, as someone else suggested, burn them onto
a CD -- I'd buy one. Although the web version, which can be constantly
updated, not to mention available to a lot more people, is probably the
best venue. 
    But I can certainly understand the problem. My interests range far
and wide, and over the ten years or so I've been hanging around the
internet and Fidonet, I've been on a great many mail lists and
newsgroups -- and there are one helluva' lot of assholes out there. And
sometimes the sheer volume is too much. 
    Hey, maybe you could post them thru one of the anon re-mailers. Then
the jerks could beat their pointy little heads against the wall trying
to answer you, and you could answer those you chose to on the list.
