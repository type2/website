This is a &quot;bad thing&quot; (tm).  That wheel cylinder is toast in a big way and
needs replacing... *but* so do the shoes and so does the wheel cylinder on
the other side!  Brakes are *always* done one axle at a time, anything you
do to the right must be done to the left as well.  My recommendation is
shoes, cylinders and springs.  rubber lines would not be a bad idea
either.

&gt;It's not leaking as
&gt; much now but I'm sure the leak didn't just go away.  (if only it were
&gt; that easy)  It's now bad enough that I have to pump the brake pedal four
&gt; or five times before it builds up enough pressure to activate the
&gt; brakes.  

Because your rear shoes are dead flat out of adjustment.  The rear shoes
on a VW bus are not self adjusting, which just about every other car made
is.  As the shoes wear, the pistons in the cylinder must advance further
and further out to get the shoes to the drum.  If you let the process go
too far, then the seals on the cylider blow (as yours have).


&gt; If I don't pump the pedal it goes all the way to the floor.  

because the rear brake circuit is not working at all.

&gt; At
&gt; the very bottom of the stroke it gets stiff and if I apply pressure the
&gt; bus stops but the brake light also comes on.  

What is happening is that the piston in the master cylinder is bottoming
out and at the very bottom it engages the front circuit only, which gives
you limited disc brake action in the front.  Because you have some
pressure in the front circuit and 0 pressure in the rear, the logic in the
brake warning light (a logical &quot;and&quot;) kicks in to tell you something is
dead wrong.

&gt; I am assuming this is not
&gt; good and try to avoid this situation by doing the pumping to build up
&gt; some pressure.  

IMHO, this is not &quot;not good&quot;; this is suicidal.  When you pump it up you
are robbing the discs of fluid and you are headed for the day (*SOON*)
when your fronts go out to, at which point you will park the bus in the
rear of a semi if you are lucky, in a school bus stop full of kids if you
are not.

&gt; I've ordered a new wheel cylinder to replace the leaky
&gt; one and will then bleed the brakes.  I hope this is all that is wrong.

*two* wheel cylinders, a set of brake shoes, and a brake spring kit!

&gt; Do you think my symptoms could all be a result of the leaky wheel
&gt; cylinder?  

and terribly mal-adjusted rear brakes, yes.

&gt; Could some air have made it's way in through the leaky area
&gt; and be contributing to the problems?  

Yes, almost certainly.

&gt; Or does it sound like I'm going to
&gt; be looking at the servo and or master cylinder after I replace the wheel
&gt; cylinder and do the bleeding?  

Maybe, but these are separate issues.  Check the servo with a vacuum
gauge. You can't really check the MC until the rear axle circuit has been
replaced.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1) Stop driving
2) Stop driving
3) Stop driving
4) fix the brakes


&gt; P.S. I am of course limiting driving with this potentially dangerous
&gt; situation to a bare minimum.  :-)

This situation is *not* potentially dangerous... this situation is bloody
suicidal and potentially murderous!  Before you move the van again, ask
yourself the question, &quot;Is this trip worth taking out a school bus stop
worth of kids??&quot;  Not to mention yourself!  you may well be minutes from
total brake failure, and from the symptoms you describe, I am willing to
bet the hand (parking) brake comes all the way out with minimal effect as
well.
