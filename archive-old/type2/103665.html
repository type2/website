&gt; I have to replace the wiring harness and at least the metal tube that the
&gt; wire goes thru from front to back (underneath and in center of bus).  This
&gt; is for a 71 SC.  I have already purchased the new Wiring harness from Wiring
&gt; Works out of CA.  &lt;Nice :) &gt;  My question is what would be the best and
&gt; easiest thing to replace the metal tube?  This truck is not and never will
&gt; be a show truck.  I am going to use it for what it is for, a truck.  I do
&gt; not have a welder and the SC will not be drivable until the wiring harness
&gt; is in place.

use some of the heavy duty plastic electrical conduit avaliable at the
local Home Depot/Lowes whatever clamp it into place with stainless steel
pipe clamps in many places.

&gt; Also what would be the best strategy for replacing the wires?  start at back
&gt; or front? Pull off a wire at a time and replace?

I would put the new harness in place beside the old one and then swap
wires one at a time from the old harness to the new one

&gt; Also don't know if will matter yet or not.  But I have the wiring harness
&gt; for a 71 bus, the front end of my SC has been replaced with a 73 and up
&gt; front end with the later turn signals also.  Will this cause major problems?

probably not
