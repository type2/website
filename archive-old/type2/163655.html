Subject: Re: [T2] bus FI info

Richard Atwell has a really great site with resources.
http://ratwell_dot_com/

Here are a few of the sites that may have some of the info you need:
Bosch L-Jetronic Technical Manual
http://bama.ua_dot_edu/~darren/boschindex.html

L-Jet manual (Type4_dot_org)
http://manuals.type4_dot_org/ljet/

Bosch L-Jetronic Fuel Injection Manual
http://www.ratwell_dot_com/mirror/potts/index.html

BTW if you need any parts, Ive got a good wiring harness, and a few other
goodies :)
and if you took a photo of the plug I may be able to help you.

good luck!

&gt; I know there is info out there but having bit of a hard time finding it
with
&gt; this shop computer (lack of links)
&gt; I'm trying to decipher the pugs on a FI harness.
&gt; this I think is a older harness as it has the 2 wires for throttle switch
&gt; .But the plug that I thought would be for the resistor is different than
the
&gt; other harnesses I have here.
&gt; instead of it being rectangle it looks like a cross an has some wires out
of
&gt; it to another black plug like goes to the afm.
&gt; I'm looking for more info on this complete injection set up
