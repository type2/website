Subject: [T2] cold start/thermo time debug

&gt;  I've been dealing with this problem for quite awhile.  To start my
&gt; 2.0L FI, I have to give it gas and keep the engine revving or it will
&gt; die.  I have to do this the first time I start the bus for 2-5 minutes,
&gt; starting around 2500 - 3000 rpms until it will idle.  Once the engine
&gt; is warm, this problem goes away.  Sounds like either the cold start
&gt; valve or thermo-time switch to me.  Anyone agree with me or have some
&gt; other insight.  Can't afford to blindly replace those parts or pay to
&gt; have the problem diagnosed and fixed.

You got the correct answer to diagnosing the real problem with your engine -
follow a step-by-step process, one component and a time - and some thoughts
about what's *really* wrong here, but no one posted, at least on the list,
why it's probably *not* the cold start valve-thermo/time switch system.
When the thermo/time switch &quot;knows&quot; the engine is cold it energizes the cold
start valve *as long as the starter is engaged.*  This extra shot of gas
will help a cold engine start up easily.  But, once the engine is running
and you release the key from the &quot;start&quot; to the &quot;run&quot; position the
thermo/time switch is no longer shunting power to the cold start valve.  So,
the fact that you can get your cold engine started OK but have to baby it to
keep it running until it's warm suggests the cold start valve-thermo/time
switch system is working OK and the fault lies elsewhere.  The aux air valve
is the logical place to look since it's designed to, in effect, hold the
throttle open a little - increasing the engine idle - until the engine is
warm.
