Subject: Re: merc wheels

&gt; Bus Boys indicates the mercedes wheels from the 70's - 80's could/might be
&gt; the 15
&gt; inchers with the same bolt pattern as the 5 lug 14 inch bus wheel...Any
&gt; verification?

All Mercedes wheels have the same bolt pattern. 5 x 112mm.
That is not the problem. The problem is the offset. Offset is how much a
wheel is off its center line. If you were to measure the width of the wheel,
divide this by two, then lay a straightedge across the back edge of the
wheel, measure from the straightedge to the face of the flange where it
mounts to the hub, then subtract the 1/2 measurement.The difference in mm is
the offset or ET.
Ideally, you want the center line of the wheel to be in the center or
slightly more to the inner bearing, since it is larger, of the two wheel
bearings. The more positive offset you have, the more you are moving the
centerline to the outside. This shifts the weight on to the smaller outer
bearing, causing premature wear. Also, this causes too much negative camber
and will wear out the inside edge of the tire. The more negative offset will
make the tire rub on the inside of the fenders, cause positive camber, and
wear out the outside edge of the tires.
The 124 body [300E] in the late 80's/early 90's did have 6.5 x 15 wheels,
but the ET was 49.
