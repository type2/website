Subject: Re: [T2] Unknown Timing

Hi Bob,
    Don't bow too far. I am running a stock dizzy.  Don't know what year you are running but my  78 ran 43 degrees total advance for
years with the stock engine. It now has an audi i5.   If you add up the centrifegal, vacuum, and initial setting in the bentley you
will find 40-45 degrees is perfect for the type 4 engine and most but not all modern engines. You get max advance 40 -44 degrees at
3k rpm on most engines.      You will never get that much total advance from a 009 thus it will never run properly.

Darrell

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, Bob.  The moral of the story is that if you time to the block, not the
&gt; &gt; &gt; distributor, it can cause you to severely overheat the engine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'll second that.  More than one Type 4 engine has been severely overheated
&gt; &gt; because the owner had an 009 distributor and timed it to the specs printed
&gt; &gt; for the engine (which originally had a vacuum-advance distributor with a
&gt; &gt; completely different advance curve). You must set timing based on the
&gt; &gt; distributor that you are using, not to the engine.
&gt;
&gt; I guess I have been doing it wrong  for 30+ years and just been D**n
&gt; lucky.   well I have also owned a timing light for almost the whole 30+
&gt; years so maybe saved my butt.
&gt;    still somehow confused, I had that damnable 009 in my bus when I bought
&gt; it and never could get it close to timed right.  but I was and still turn
&gt; on timing light, start engine and aim light and make sure the timing marks
&gt; are where they belong and that it advances correctly.
&gt;     have temp guage and it never gets over 240 on the hottest of days on
&gt; the interstate...lately (it's winter) it has been barely reaching 200 on
&gt; the interstate at 65mph
&gt;
&gt; certainly I bow down to the knowledge of Steve and Ron, they have more
&gt; experience than I ever will on the VW bus.
&gt;
&gt;   now to figure out what dist I actually have (think it is the correct one
&gt; for my engine) and compare that with the &quot;real&quot; specs
&gt;
&gt; Mea Culpa to anyone I may have mislead.  although honestly I am still
&gt; confused about the way bentley presents it, thank goodness for the list.
