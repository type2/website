&gt; The bad news is, the compression is not good: 100-135-135-100. Also, it's
&gt; leaking oil bad on one side--he said the push rod tubes need to be replaced
&gt; (the PO had just finished doing one side but didn't get to the other).

100 psi is good compression--right on the edge of good, but good
nonetheless. What I'm worried about is the differential in there--five
pounds difference between cylinders is okay, but 35? Not so hot. Did he tell
you which cylinders were at 100 and which at 135?

This is what I'd do: Get your bus back and drive it home. Get a compression
tester and test your engine, then squirt some oil down the spark plug holes
and test it again. If there was a jump after you squirted in the oil, you've
got bad rings. No difference? Bad valves. If both low cylinders are on the
same side of the engine, I'd let the engine completely cool then torque the
heads to VW specs and check it again. This has fixed engines for me.

Volkswagen did a very nice thing when they designed the Type 4 engine, which
you've got: they made it so you can replace the pushrod tubes with the
engine in the car. You take off the valve covers, then the rockers, then
grab the pushrod tube and slide it toward the head. It comes right out.
