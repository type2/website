Subject: Re: [T2] Tire noise

Richard,

What kind of noise?  Rock in the tread?....yeah, I know, you would 
have looked for that..


Wonder if the rim is cracked somewhere around one of the supports or something?

Can you make it do it if you push the bus back and forth at a certain 
place?

Makes the noise in a straight line or just on curves?

Cheers, dave

&gt; There is a repetitive noise that's been driving me nuts lately and I seemed

&gt; 
&gt; If I rotate tires, the noise moves with the tire. I'm not sure what to be
&gt; glad of at this point although it's sort of a relief it's not CV or bearing
&gt; noise. Anyway, the tire looks perfectly fine to the eye.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had a similar experience?
