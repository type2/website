I just hate when a domain isn't &quot;fully&quot; registered.  You'll have to add the
&quot;www&quot; to the link in Andrew's message for those of you who did not figure it
out.

&gt; Eron,
&gt; There's a guy here in Australia who specialises in
&gt; transplanting V6's &amp; V8's into Baywindows.
&gt; His name is Kimm Garland &amp; he run a company called
&gt; Indian Automotive that does all sorts of bus work,
&gt; everything from general services to split-window
&gt; restorations to Baywindow hot rodding.
&gt; You can check them out at http://kruizinwagon_dot_com.au
&gt; Kimm should be able to give you lots of hints.
&gt; He runs a GM supercharged &amp; EFI 3.8 litre V6 in his
&gt; severly slammed 71 Dual Cab &amp; it's a weapon!
&gt; Best of luck.
&gt; :-)
&gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hello listees,
&gt; &gt; I am currently looking into transplanting a VR6
&gt; &gt; watercooled powerplant into
&gt; &gt; my '70 Deluxe.  Aside from the obvious modifications
&gt; &gt; necessary(which I feel
&gt; &gt; confident I can tackle alone), there is the single
&gt; &gt; issue of rear(which would
&gt; &gt; be side form the original vehicle) motor mounting.
&gt; &gt; Is there anyone in the
&gt; &gt; Boise,Idaho/SE Oregon area who knows of, or can
&gt; &gt; themselves handle the
&gt; &gt; fabrication necessary to create a custom mounting
&gt; &gt; mechanism for such a
&gt; &gt; transplant?  The last time I looked into this, I was
&gt; &gt; given websites with
&gt; &gt; information on a Vanagon-VR6 transplant, and a Chevy
&gt; &gt; Vortec V-6 into a Bus,
&gt; &gt; but these projects were different enough that I
&gt; &gt; couldn't use either as a
&gt; &gt; reference.  Any help would be appreciated.  If
&gt; &gt; anyone knows of anyone else
&gt; &gt; who has tackled this also, perhaps they could point
&gt; &gt; me in their direction as
&gt; &gt; well?  Thank you all(in advance).
&gt; &gt;
