Subject: Sunroof-1979 Transporter

All:

The sunroof on my recently purchased '79 Transporter ($300) is stuck.  It is
out of the track (half-in and half-out on one side, other side is ok). It won't
budge either way.  I've taped up the seams on the roof to keep water out (I
live near Seattle).  

Any ideas on how to get the sunroof out so I can rebuild it?  Everything I've
tried puts too much stress on the roof and I'm afraid I'll break it.  The Haynes
manual is helpful regarding the mechanics of a healthy roof system but not much
on removing a stuck roof.   

Also, does anybody know how rare these sunroof busses are?  I don't see many
around.  

Thanks. 

JIM
