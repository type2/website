I'm commenting here, as an idiot and largely without proper forethought
last winter and because I was freezing I ran out and bought an
Instaheater (used to advertise in the mags), bought the highest I
felt a late Bus could drive, 45 amp, considering my 55 amp alternator
and ran it off the '78s aux battery.  This was of course stupid,
45 amps at 12 Volts is about 500 watts, IE THE POWER OF A HAIR DRYER
ON LOW, think about it, even with a heavily insulated Bus, might as
well have not had it, a 20 amp unit putting out a whopping 240 watts
is a joke in the volume of a bus.  A recirculating system though the
stock exchangers is the ticket, those things are putting out more
heat than an electrical unit ever will, simply need to reheat the
interior air, not keep trying to heat outside air.  Most buses are
drafty enough you aren't going to deplete your oxygen supply easily.
An insulated partition is a great idea as well, this winter I'm likely
going to make one simply out of a custom cut piece of R-board.
A stock generator is like what somewhere in the 25-40 amp range, sure
not enough to make electric a viable option, particularly in winter
when your battery is already taking a big hit.

my opinions.
