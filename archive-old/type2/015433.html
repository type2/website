In 1972/3 I bought a 69 Type 2 Kombi. It had an 1800cc suitcase motor with
dual Solex carbs, very much like the type 3 setup, not like the 72 and
later setup. All factory stock. It was a spezial commercial model with no
rear seats or side liners, very bare bones. I had no idea then how rare
this setup was. I knew it was atypical. Now I know I have never seen or
heard of another like it. I have no further recollection of specifics as to
engine mounts and such except that it obviously had a rear mount of some
kind. I don't even remember if it had an oil filter.
