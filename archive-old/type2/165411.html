&gt; &gt;&quot;If webbing-grabbers are so effective,
&gt; &gt;why doesn't the government make
&gt; &gt;them compulsory when older cars'
&gt; &gt;seatbelts wear out?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 	This joker is the same one who condemns the T2 as a mere
&gt; 'lifestyle choice', not a practical vehicle.  I view him as a mixed
&gt; bag.
&gt; 	But thanx for notifying us that there are improved versions
&gt; of 'inertial' belts.  I hadn't known this.

That article is really a mixed bag.  The writer condemns belts that have a
certain amount of &quot;stretch&quot; without realizing that that stretch can reduce
injury in an accident.  As long as the belt stops the occupant before they
strike the interior of the car the stretch is an asset, not a detriment.

I am leery of the &quot;webbing grabber&quot; design.  Having the webbing sliding
through a confined &quot;grabber&quot; would increase wear to the belt in a region
that is not easily inspected.  Not a good design, IMO.

The graphics in the article are laughable.  The one showing the aftermath
of an accident with a diagonal-only belt clearly shows the occupant
hitting head first, which cannot happen with this type of
restraint.  The occupant would &quot;submarine&quot; under the belt, not launch over
the belt.  This lack of attention to reality relegates this article to
&quot;scare story&quot; status.
