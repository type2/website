Subject: Bleeding Brakes

I bought a bleeding kit from Trac Auto and ended up taking it back...It had no
advantage over my old technique of running a rubber hose into a half full can of
brake fluid.  I've heard of kits which have a one way check valve to prevent the
sucking up of dirty brake fluid.  Such a kit might be worth the trouble and
money.
