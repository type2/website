The thing is is WHY. I can understand not using VW logo or the word
VOLKSWAGEN, but to go after people using it to describe there business is
stupid. If you look in the archives, copyright, a person who used VW and
volkswagen as a way to discribe there business BEAT VWoA in court. The thing
is who has the money to go against there bank of attorneys!. Remember that
every time one of there attorneys sends a letter they just made $300.00
dollars (the attorneys) and VWoA just pis#ed on anther group of loyalist. I
AM MAD!!!!!

ronnie   off to a NON VWoA sponsered show!

VWoA is *using* the ACVW people who show up as poster children
to further their cause.   You're getting *tooled* by attending;
an unwitting PR prop, and like a drunk sorority girl, you'll be
dropped and forgotten until the next time you're needed.
