Hi Steven and Billy,
Thanks for the reply.
I am already trying to do exactly what you are describing, but I can't get it
to work due to this grounding problem.  I may not have made myself clear in
the first post.  The horn appears to be grounded where it is mounted to the
frame.  Literally the bolt that holds the horn to the frame is what completes
the circuit.  Should the horn itself be insulated from the frame?  Am I
missing some rubber part(s) that would do this?  It works fine if I unbolt it
from the frame.
And Billy, I understand how the horn circuit works (silly as it may be), and I
understand how the horn was originally grounded.  But when I disconnect the
original ground wire from the horn, and thus create an &quot;open&quot; space within the
original circuit, the horn still sounds.  The horn will sound with ONLY the
12v wire connected, meaning the horn has found a new ground (without using a
ground wire.)  Hope that made sense.
The saga continues.
Thanks again.
-PM

&gt; Paul,

&gt; If you are going to go this route (and after 4-5 go-rounds with the horn
&gt; on my '73, I am *certainly not* saying it's a bad route to go), I would
&gt; ditch the whole stock horn button concept.  Head to your local FLAPS.
&gt; They sell generic horn buttons, buy one.  Buy one that includes some sort
&gt; of strap to strap it to the steering column.  Install the button on the
&gt; steering column.  Run a wire from one contact of that button to
&gt; the body of the bus (ground).  Run a second wire from the other from the
&gt; button to the horn. check both wires that lead in to the horn for 12V.
&gt; put your new wire on the contact that *DOES NOT* have 12V!  Bingo, yer
&gt; done.
&gt;
&gt; The stock horn circuit is one of the bigger PITA's that VW ever came up
&gt; with.  I have worked on it, I have gotten it to work, but it requires
&gt; total insulation between the steering shaft and the shell, which is
&gt; verrrry difficult in vehicles as old as ours are.  About the only excuse I
&gt; have for maintaining the stock system other than my vintperv fascination
&gt; is that it does force me to check the isolator disk at the bottom of the
&gt; steering shaft every year or two.
&gt;
&gt;                            Steve Dolan

Actually, the horn grounds when you push the button on the steering wheel.
grounds right to the column. so in bypassing this, you lost your ground.
