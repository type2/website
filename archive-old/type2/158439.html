Not as  many as 
&gt;last year, I think Cruz of the rain - and Troy Tical didn't  drive his 
&gt;bus


Guilty here because of the rain and the new 65  camper that  needs a lot of 
seals to stay dry, and or the 67 westy that needs full  restoration(last years 
HCBF winner of the&quot; most need of restoration &quot; award  not to mention the 
wife's new 72 westy.  (needs windshield  and tires ... frig I'm sure its going to 
get worked on first)
