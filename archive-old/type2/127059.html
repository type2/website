I disagree that the best way to lower is via torson arm adjusters.  This
method reduces the available wheel travel and changes the steering
geometry.

Better are lowering spindles that leave the trailing arms and steering
tierods where they belong and allow full wheel travel.  They also make it
much easier to return things to original.
