Subject: Re: [T2] Marvel Mystery Oil (was oil additive advise)

MMO is really just a solvent mixed with oil.  The solvent can be good for
things like stuck lifters, but you have to balance that with its possible
negative effects on other parts of an engine.  It will loosen sludge from
engine surfaces just as well as it cleans it from the lifters, so unless
you change the oil filter promptly it can cause big problems.

I don't know why MMO has escaped &quot;snake oil&quot; reputation, but for some
reason it is now a mainstream product.  It has a purpose, but it isn't
magic by any means!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure what is in it but I was introduced to Marvel Mystery Oil in
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1965. Since this product is still in business they gotta be doing something
&gt; &gt; &gt; correct.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I found the MSDS for Marvel Mystery Oil. MMO contains:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-refined mineral oil&quot;
&gt; &gt; * at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-dewaxed mineral oil&quot;
&gt; &gt; * and no more than 30 percent Stoddard Solvent (mineral spirits)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's all they listed. Motor oil with parts cleaner in it. Helluva concept,
&gt; &gt; and one that works extremely well.
