Hey y'all
When I put the Tinkertoy together I installed a Pertronix unit.  Because
I ws in a hurry and she hadn't been run in 5 years I assumed the poor
running was a carburetor problem.  Once I got to my destination
(Tinkertoy in tow) I started chasing what I thought was a clogged
somethingorother in the carb. I tried rejetting, adjusting, rebuilt the
damn thing twice.  I'm no stranger to carbs having done, with great
success, everything from carter1into2 bbl on 40's era Packards to
Rochesters, Holleys, Mikuni's - you name it.  Damn Solex was giving me
fits.

We were going to visit my Mom in St Pete.  Wife driving, I'm trying to
sleep having worked the previous 24.  Head leaned against the Bpost
listening to the engine.  Running good then just like a switch, started
acting up again (DAMN!).  Hmmm.  Switch.

Next morning broke out the tools, and a set of points &amp; condenser I
carried in case that miracle of modern electronics failed.  The
Pertronix had indeed gone bad. The Tinkertoy ran the best she ever had,
and 1 year later I'm just now maybe thinking about trying another
Pertronix in the Dor.

But I still won't go without carrying a spare set of good old basic
ignition components.

Dave
