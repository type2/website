&gt; I believe it!  Driving north on 550 one time from Durango to Ouray my 86 GTI 
&gt; was really lugging up a hill.  I was wondering what was going on and was 
&gt; considering pulling over to do an engine check. Just then I passed a sign 
&gt; that read something like &quot;Red Mountain Pass, Elev 11,000 feet.&quot; Man, that's 
&gt; an altitude airplanes fly at!  An altimeter (or an oxygen mask) would have 
&gt; been useful.  Good thing I wasn't driving the bus...

been there done that, my 65 Westy just barely got over Red Mountain Pass,
and the engine never ran right after that, sorry I didn't have oil
temp/presure guages then. I drove it back to Baltimore without turning the
engine off, parked it behind my house and the engine never ran again.  

sold it cheap too, and it was a pristine (well almost) white westy. (of
course this was 73 or so)
