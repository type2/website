Subject: re GL5/GL4 connundrum...

I'm personally satisfied with this concept, especially because GL4 is so hard
to find, unless you want to buy a big pail of it. My local lubratorium has
GL5/MT1, and I've changed it twice.

&lt;..but wait, here's more!...

&gt; To add my 2 cents worth... Bob Hoover is quite right, the first GL5
&gt; standard is slightly corrosive to the bronze in VW gearboxes when it's
hot.
&gt;
&gt; Once the oil companies discovered this, they improved the GL5 standard&gt; to
GL5-MTI (VW aren't the only gearboxes to have bronze components),&gt; which is
NOT corrosive to VW gearboxes and is quite safe to use.
&gt;
&gt; GL3 and GL4 standards are quite OK too.
&gt;
&gt; The normal VW gearbox oil is 85w90 or 80w90 Hypoid.  The 80w90 is&gt; better if
you live in an area of snowy winters - it will make for&gt; smoother gearchanges
on cold mornings.
&gt;
&gt; The Synthetic gearbox oils are often 75w90, and this is fine too -
&gt; making for even smoother changes on cold mornings.  So long as it's&gt; GL5-MT1
and NOT the original GL5 standard.
&gt;
