Subject: [T2] What kinda bus do I have

   Well I'm new to this whole thing but being a surfer and sailor I love the 
space not to mention the simplicity and do it yourself nature of the bus.  
However I was wonder what kind I am exactly.
My Chassis # is 2232242534
So I know I am a 73 Type 2    am I a Kombi? Westy?
Also I'm not a pop top camper but a good portion of the midle section of the 
bus is a sunroof that slides back.  I don't know if thats original.  Is it?

    Aloha,
     Daniel

      73 ?   name to come
