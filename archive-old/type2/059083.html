Subject: Rear Disc Brake Conversion?

Hi All!

Just thought I would ask, as long as I have to replace/repair my rear brakes I
thinks to myself 4 has gotta be better than two!  Seriously, anyone performed
this conversion?  I know the ebrake thing is usually the roadblock, but I
haven't seen anyone offering such a modification.  My 74 has front discs and
rear drums.

Thanks in advance!

dave.  (BTW - Thanks Brian, Marv and others, the steering box adjustment and
replacement of the coupling disc, went fine, steering is really nice and tight,
I don't think I need a new box!).
