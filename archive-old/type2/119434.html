Subject: Re: [T2] Auto trans Bus engine RPM's

Thanks for the replies.. I have an alternative engine project that would
work perfect if the trans ratio was closer to 2500rpm at 65mph,,,,I
thought maybe the auto trans reduced the engine rpm..
the engine torque curve goes up to 6k rpm so it won't hurt to run it in
the standard bus 091 trans.
