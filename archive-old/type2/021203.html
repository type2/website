Here is a few quotes from the online pages

   The June Jitter Bug is one of the largest VW shows in Canada. The Jitter Bug
is held at
 Firemen's Park in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The Jitter Bug has continued to be
the VW Car
  Show in Ontario that keeps the enthusiasts coming back year after year. It's
&quot;Claim to
 Fame&quot; has always been it's &quot;Free Admission&quot; to spectators and it's &quot;Fun&quot;
atmosphere
 for the whole day. With tons of games happening for both Adults and Children,
getting
 bored at this show never happens, making the Jitter Bug, &quot;Not just another car
show&quot;.
 On the Saturday night before the Main Event, we have a Cruise Night at a local
Drive-In
 restaurant where every body gathers to chat about VWs and what ever else A
chance
  to catch up on the gossip with old and new friends, and a chance to see
Niagara Falls.
   During the evening we have a Engine Tear Down contest and later in the
evening a
  Giant cruise past the beautiful Niagara Falls. (Be prepared because you might
get wet
from the mist) We then return to the Drive-In for the rest of the evening to
finish up with
                       checking out every bodies Kool set of wheels.

       Sunday is the main event and gates open for vendors at 7:00AM. Vendor fee
is
 $20.00. Gates open for Show cars and Spectators at 9:00 AM.  Show car
registration fee
 is $15.00, $12.00 with a canned good ( For Project Share Food Bank ) $1000 if
you are a
 member of the NVF. There are door prizes given out on a regular basis
throughout the
  day. The Swap Meet is incredible with new and used parts vendors, T-shirt
vendors,
  and even Tool vendors, you won’t go home empty handed. To top things off, the
BBQ
   features famous Pillers Meats cooked to perfection to savor anyone's
appetite. The
 quality of cars is just incredible to say the least. The June Jitter Bug is now
in it’s 15th
    year and this year promises to be the best one yet. Last year the Famous &quot;
Clutch
   Eater&quot; which is a giant teeter - totter for cars seemed to challenge quite a
few. What
  you do is drive your car up one side and try to balance your car in the
middle. This is
   extremely difficult to do, because one inch too much past the pivot point
sends the
  teeter - totter off balance and makes you go in reverse. This sequence happens
back
    and forth for about 1 minute long, then someone else tries. Only a few have
ever
  mastered this. The winner receives a great compliment for his car. A New
Clutch!!! All
                  in all the Jitter Bug is one show you don't want to miss.
