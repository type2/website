Subject: Re: [T2] Starting troubles in San Diego

Ok.  So I remove the right head cover, a half a cup of oil dumps out as I do.  Oil continually drips out as I poke around.  3 of the 4 rockers feel normal.  The second from the front, the number 1 exhaust?, has a pretty big gap.  Lots of rock in the rocker.  The other parts all looked in there correct places.  I didn't do anything else under there as I am parked in the street plus I can't say I'd really know what to do.  So I put the cover back on.

And btw, this is on a 74 type 4 1800 dual carb engine.

I got the #1 Spark Plug out; the lube did the trick.  Bad news.  The tip of the plug is completely gunked up with metal shavings.  I didn't take the time to drain the oil and check the strainer but I'm sure I'd find more shavings there.

So, correct me if I'm wrong but I appear to be in a situation where, at the very least, the head needs to come off and likely replaced.  On the more extreme side, there's a possibility of having to replace the block as well.

As such, my thoughts turn towards getting it to a shop.  I kinda like the idea of getting away from the type 4 engine and replacing it with a good sized type 1 single carb.  Or even finding a similar Westy with a strong drive train and transfer over my interior.

San   Diego locals, I could really use a recommendation for a shop in the Clairemont/La Jolla area.

Comments, ideas, suggestions, offers to buy are welcome and appreciated.
Thanks again, all!

: At this point I'd be pulling the valve covers and looking for  
oddities there.  Beginning to sound like a valve problem.
