Subject: Re: [T2] Name of &quot;partial&quot; pop-top?

Actually, they did appear on 68 to around 74 Type 2s in Europe, installed
usually at the center of the vehicle.  Over the years, I've heard it called
the &quot;European Poptop&quot; that Westfalia installed then.  I used to make and
sell the seal  and replacement canvas for it back in the 80s and early 90s,
although not very many of them.

64-67 Westys began what was called the &quot;Center Poptop&quot;  In 68 it was
continued to be made by Westfalia and sold mostly in Europe and into Canada
as well.  Never sold in the USA to my knowledge.  It was a bit longer in
length than the 64-67 Variety.  I used to have a very nice used Euro-Poptop
cover in my stash until around 15 years ago.  I haven't seen one in about a
decade.

&gt; I am interested in possibly retro-fitting my standard '76 with a pop-
&gt; top I have seen occasionally. I would like to know the official
&gt; terminology for the style of top that is only around 1/3 as long as a
&gt; full Westy top. To be fair, I think I've only seen these on pre-68
&gt; buses, but would still like to know how to refer to them in my search.
&gt; I believe my current bus is in very good mechanical condition - don't
&gt; want to go through what I did on it with another unit. Though, in the
&gt; end, I might settle for another project with a Weekender version.
