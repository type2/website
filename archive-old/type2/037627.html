Chris,
I've always had good luck using an impact driver, It's a screw driver that
twists slightly when you hit the end of it with a hammer.  You get the
benefit of unscrewing and tapping at the same time.  Short of that I'd
suggest tapping the end of the screw with a hammer then trying to loosen it.

Good Luck,
Dan Evans

&gt; Any other suggestions for removing a stuck screw? Or am I right in
&gt; assuming that the screw and the head are now inseparably connected?
