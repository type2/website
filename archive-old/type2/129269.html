Subject: misfire question

Ok, so I just changed out my points for a compufire and the engine is 
already running better, however, I *still* have this strange misfire. 
It does not seem to have a pattern.. just kinda random thumps.  It's not 
horrible, but I want to get this enging running smoooooooth and I think 
it is possible.

I have the megasquirt installed so I can see a very clean tach signal. 
I am even tempted to hook up an o-scope to verify that the tach is 
clean.  I also watched the pulsewidth going to the injectors and it's 
barely changing, meaning, the injector open time is relatively constant 
and fuel flow *should* be constant as well.  I also checked the fuel 
pressure and it is holding nicely.  Valves are all in spec.  And the 
last time I checked compression I got: 1:142, 2:141, 3:140, 4:145

I guess the only things I can really think of are either the spark plugs 
or a faulty injector(s) being faulty.  Can anyone think of what else 
might be causing my strange misfire?  Any quick and nifty ways to test 
either of these?

Thanks,
Mike
