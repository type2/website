&gt;I can't remember if the automatic was available in '73, but the stock 1974 automatic bus would be.  My guess is that someone dropped a '73 drive train into your '74 Safare.

&gt;The transmission is still original. Never been redone. Which is actually the next question.....Who does the list recommend for transmission rebuilding?? Do the large transmission chains, such as AAMCO do a good job on aircooled vehicles?? Anybody had any experiences with them??

My experience with Aamco on another somewhat unusual car was all bad.  Unless you have a 95 Accord or 93 Taurus, they won't know what to do with it.
