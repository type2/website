&gt; This is a '72 dual PDSITs. It does not have the carburetor

&gt; between the carbs.

Take the reading from the left carb where the distributor picks up  
it's vacuum retard signal.

&gt; The left and right carb manifolds supply the brake booster with  
&gt; vacuum [so to speak]. At idle, what manifold vacuum should I be  
&gt; reading off the balance pipe at bus-boy's    item  F. 021-129-637D  
&gt; Elbow-Manifold Balance Pipe Bus/PU 1700 Right Side 1972 Only
&gt;
&gt; in this diagram http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/carb1.html

I'm not sure how the reading is going to differ at that location as  
I've never measured it there.

&gt; And a second question, again at idle, what vacuum readings should I  
&gt; expect to see at the left carb for advance [throttle vacuum] and  
&gt; retard [manifold vacuum].

This depends on your distributor. If it's stock at you have vacuum  
retard hooked up you should see 9-10&quot; of manifold vacuum at 5 ATDC  
and no ported vacuum signal. If you have the engine timed to 7.5 BTDC  
with another distributor you should see 15&quot; of manifold vacuum or  
more. That would indicate an engine that is breathing correctly.
