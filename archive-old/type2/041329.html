Subject: newbie w/a weak tranny

Hi listers,
	I just bought a 78' bus and have been &quot;lurking&quot; for a few weeks.
Now I'd like the collective wisdom of the list on my problem. The 2L FI
engine is fine but the transmission (4 speed) is not. The synchro is so
weak you can't upshift into any gear without grinding unless you're going
granny speed and have a very light hand on the shifter. Forget
downshifting. I've adjusted the clutch and changed the trans.oil (80W
Valvoline) - didn't help. A mechanic buddy of mine, who is conversant with
VW's, suggested I run ATF in place of regular transmission oil. That sounds
a little far-fetched to me.  I can't afford to buy a new transmission right
now. Should I try this experiment or does anyone else have any advice for
dealing with a weak tranny?

Thanks for your help,

Frank Ahern
