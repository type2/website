&gt; I have had the points rubbing block break off.  And the spot welds

I keep a timing light too, but only use it to make sure that the vacuum
advance is working properly.

In fact, I usually check timing without a meter of any sort.  Turn
ignition on, turn engine slowly toward TDC, listen for the light &quot;snap&quot; of
the spark and see where the timing mark is when I hear it.  Works great!
