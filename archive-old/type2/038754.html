&gt; I noticed that the screws holding the coil on were loose - way loose.

As I recall, there are nuts spot-welded to the inside of the fan shroud.
Either their threads are shot or they have broken loose.  Either way it is
pretty nasty.  If the nuts are still attached, you could probably try to
gently retap them larger.
