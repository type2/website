i finally broke down and took the bus to local vw expert yesterday.  i got 
some bad news.  he came to the same conclusion i had been coming to after 
testing everything out according to the bentley.  the brain may be bad.  
unfortunately i start college in 10 days and need a dependable vehicle to 
get me to and from school and work, so i'm gonna have to let her go....i 
figured someone out there might want to take her off my hands.  the body is 
nice, the interior is even nicer, the engine is clean, it just needs some 
fuel injection attention.  i paid $400 and hope to get that back.  it's a 
'78 van.  i'm in lancaster pennsylvania.  this is a NICE bus, i just don't 
have the time or money to do it right now.  i took a gamble and got screwed, 
but that's the way it works sometimes....

mark.
