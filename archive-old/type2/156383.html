&gt; I have a 76 Trans and I can't find the short to

Circuit 12? Track 12 on the diagrams? Fuse 12?
I'll assume fuse 12. Check the baseplates inside the
brake/taillight sockets. If a wire got snagged and
pulled tight, the brake light wire / terminal may be
shorting.

Horn circuit. If your turn signal switch or your
hi/low beams acts strange and sometimes causes horn to
honk, there's a good poss that's the target site.

Hazard warning switch. If I remember correctly, this
is also on fuse 12. It causes all kinds of problems.
They like to come apart inside. For awhile, my bus
engine wouldn't shut off with the hazard warning
switch hooked up!

My #1 pick, though, is that fuse 12 is a 16 amp
circuit and requires a 16 amp red fuse. Could that be
the prob?
