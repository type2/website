	Hej

	Since there has been very little discussion on this matter i feel i have
to give my contribution........... 
To the original poster: Don't take all these puritans too hard. 
In Finland we have a saying: Kaikki ei tarvitse olla niin viimeisen päälle! 
In free translation: Everything does not have to bee perfect! 
A cheap engineless bus can have a productive and joyfull life with a cheap
type1 engine. Seal the gaps in the engine compartment with whatewer you
got, drive and enjoy the bus.  Maybe someday you'll find a fresh type4
engine you can use. Keep the type1 engine as a spare engine if you need to
do any bigger repairs to the type4.

	My 1971 Kombiwagen has seen a lot of miles with it's spare engine, a beast
put together from junk from mine and my friends garages. With a helping
friend the engines can be switched in an hour. 
	The engine i normally use is a 1775 type1 with a balanced counterweighed
crank, balaced pistons and pushrods. The first edition got a crack in the
left block half, a normal failure when the cylinder holes in the block are
opened to accept larger cylinders. The second edition with a brand new
block has now lived 100000 km without showing more signs of wear than
normal.
