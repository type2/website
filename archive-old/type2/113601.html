Subject: Re: [T2] Tin Snip question

&gt;If you're going this route, try this out before you carry all that stuff 
&gt;into a junkyard.  Body metal can be quite tough, and a small inverter 
&gt;(&lt;600Watts) may not supply enough juice to keep a good power tool running 
&gt;at full capacity. Be sure to try a test at home before you load all that 
&gt;stuff in your bus.

Take you kiddo's wagon and load into it 3 car batteries (whatever you've 
got) and a good inverter - 300W+. That will run my bigger tools as long as 
I don't stall it or start it under load. I also used several fuses (pops if 
I stall the tool).

We ran the car when I went out into the country to cut out some moustache 
bar brackets for my Trans-vair project. I don't know if a single battery 
would have had enough capacity but in  a junkyard I'd take the batteries 
out of the other family cars and take them with me. Tell your wife so she 
doesn't freak when the car won't start! &lt;grin&gt;

When I was in the Navy and had no garage (Navy wanted my partially 
completed Beetle to be registered, insured and have lights - the towbar did 
not exempt it from a safety check!) I rented a storage unit and used a car 
battery and my inverter to run my tools and a drop light. I could do a full 
day's work with 1 good battery if it didn't involve alot of heavy tool usage.

If you buy an inverter be sure the internal fan works. Mine didn't - I 
thought it was thermostatically controlled - but after the moustache bar 
trip I realized it wasn't ever coming on and the inverter got quite hot. 
It's hot wired now and comes on whenever the switch is on.
