&gt;One thing is a bit weird though. The partnr on the

&gt;That's the number for the original hubcab. But the
&gt;title of the webpage is &quot;Hubcap 251601151A&quot;...and that
&gt;is the partnr for the Vanagon and 1980ties Beetles
&gt;hubcab.

I noticed that as well when I saw the ad a few days ago and when I asked Jeni and she told me the part number in the window title was a mistake and was used for the previous hubcap that was advertized on that page.
