Subject: front wheel carrier 75 Westy

I am looking for a good way to store my spare tire, not that the under the
sink method isn't pure genius, but I saw the picture of the caravan at
ftp://ftp.ari_dot_net/users/dworkin and the picture of the 75 (pat*****)with the
tire on the front inspired me.  I also read the rookie mistake bit on the
list that touted front wheel carriers as a mistake.  Now... Is there a way to
attach the wheel carrier to the bumper, as it looks like has been done on the
pictured 75, or does one have to drill 6 holes in the front of the bus and
mount it like the guy at our local vw place told me to?  Just trying not to
bugger up the bus.  Oh.. if there is a bumper mount, where can I get one?   
Thanks for all who help, and those who read on...
