&gt; taking off any nuts that Gas Station Bozo has air-hammered on and putting
&gt; them back on with anti-seize and correct torque.

&gt; One of the tire places here in North Jersey, EuroTire, has always impressed

&gt; wrench after looking up the specs on their computer.  Can't imagine why the
&gt; dealer doesn't respect their own cars enough to do the same.

I'm also surprised they don't take the care. Our local tire shops always 
torque the wheels... for the last 5 or 10 years. They told me that they 
do it to avoid product liability suits.
