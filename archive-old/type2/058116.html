Subject: Tranny needed -- '76 - '79

    Had a real fun time on my trip from Mobile to Wisconsin -- stopped for
gas in Cave City, Kentucky, everything had been running great, but when I
stopped at the stop sign just before getting back on the freeway, I
suddenly couldn't catch 1st or 2nd (or reverse) but had 3rd and 4th. Since
I had a line of cars behind me, I tried to take off in 3rd, which worked,
more or less, but from that point on I was stuck in 3rd. 
    Pulled over and spent several hours trying to free it up, and then
some more hours trying to rent a U-haul and car dolly. Finally decided
that rather than spend close to a grand to have it towed to WI, and since
there weren't going to be any U-haul trucks available for a few days, I
would see how far I could get driving in 3rd gear. 
    Ended up driving the next 548 miles to WI in 3rd -- at 45mph.
Absolutely wonderful fun. Had to be extremely careful where I stopped for
gas, of course, and ran quite a few stop signs. Chicago was especically a
treat. Figured it didn't really matter -- the tranny was toast, and
burning up the clutch was no biggy when you have to pull the engine
anyway. And every mile was one less I'd have to pay $1.50 for getting
towed. 
    So does anyone have a good 090 ('76-'79) tranny they want to part
with?
