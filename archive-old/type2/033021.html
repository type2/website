Subject: vacuum hoses:  thanks!

Thanks to all who responded to my questions about the distributor vacuum hoses on my
72 Campmobile, Lily.

I've replaced both hoses (3.5mm and 4.5mm), set the idle and retimed the engine and
she's running really well.

Setting by the shop last week when I brought her home:  10 degrees BTDC, idle at
1300 rpm.

Setting by me:  1 degree BTDC, idle at 950 rpm.

I like my settings more (even though they are not at perfect spec they are a lot
closer than before) and so does Lily.

Thanks everyone for your help,

Peace,

Dale G
Lily (72 Campmobile, 1700 rebuilt to 2000)
