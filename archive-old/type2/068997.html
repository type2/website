Subject: Re: '67 color schemes

&gt;&gt; Has anyone compiled a list of factory offered paint schemes for 
&gt;&gt;a '67 bus?
&gt;
&gt;Dave Easterwood has just put up a very comprehnsive list on colour 
&gt;schemes on busses from 1950 -&gt; 1967, although there are a few bugs 
&gt;to work out on the page overallit is is very impressive.
&gt;
&gt;Check it out at  http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/paint.html

I had not announced this to the masses yet, since it still has a 
few bugs in it.  Problems I am aware of are splotchy color chips 
(which I think is a result of 256 color small gif images - I will 
try to correct these this weekend), the wrong paint code and 
paint chip for Chestnut Brown, the '67 2-tone for Velvet Green 
should be Pearl white (not Blue White), etc.

If anyone spots other mistakes, please call them to my attention.

Dave (the bus geek)
