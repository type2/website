Subject: Carbs vs. FI
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.990513222552.5111A-100000_at_techsrv1.tech.mtu_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; Well here is my opinion on this (everyone knows where this is going....)
&gt; I personally would NOT buy a van that had been converted from FI to carb
&gt; unless it was the nicest Westy in the universe AND the owner had every
&gt; single FI part, nut, and bolt in a box, clearly labeled for me to
&gt; re-install and was willing to take a few hundred off the price for my
&gt; trouble.

--&gt; I can understand this point of view.  Not everyone who carbs an FI
engine does it through lack of knowledge, though.  I thoroughly understood
the FI system on my van...after going through it multiple times from end
to end, it became obvious that it had multiple chronic problems, at least
one of them very expensive.  Since I knew the van would never have a
prayer of passing emissions, should I ever move to California (it had the
unobtainable EGR valve missing, an aftermarket exhaust, and was a Federal
model to begin with), I made a decision to put carbs on it.  I agree that
FI is more efficient, and runs better.  When new, it was no doubt more
reliable.  Mine had suffered years of abuse and tinkering by a clueless
PO, and I got sick of it stranding me.  Just my choice and my opinion.
