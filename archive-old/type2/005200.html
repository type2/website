Subject: Westy Which color for interior Vinyl
Date: Wed, 28 Feb 2001 15:57:32 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'm in the process of removing the interior of my 72 Westy and was wondering
if anybody had changed the color of the seat fabric? I have an industrial
sewing machine ( don't know how to use it yet) and have bolts of tan, white,
light blue, dark blue, and brown vinyl. The Westy is white so I'm open to
any ideas especially if you have pictures of the finished project. One more
question, has anyone covered the wood in a Westy on the ceiling? I was
trying to be different and quiet the darn thing down a bit.
Thanks,
Britt
