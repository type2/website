Subject: Re: [T2] Help! - Now it's gas in MY oil!

Hi John,

 From what I remember, the oil level was high, the oil was thin and it 
reeked of gas. Collie was draining the oil prior to a complete engine 
rebuild at the time, so we weren't too worried about it at the time.

Happy trails,

&gt; Thanks again for the tips. Did your friend also experience increase in
&gt; oil volume due to gasoline entering the crankcase from rich running
&gt; conditions?
