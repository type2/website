Subject: New Website up for Beta testing sorta

Hey folks...  well, i know i promised a new classifieds page for everyone to
try out but I got a little sidetracked on the Gallery section of my site.
The only thing working on the site right now is the gallery section.  Please
check it out and upload an image of something VW related.  For an added
incentive Ive decided to try something called the Feature Free For All.
This is where you all get to choose what shows up on the front page right
then and there.  Thats right!!  You can ensure the placement of your V-Dub
right on the front page!  hehe.. until someone else selects a new one.
We'll see how it goes.

Anyway, the classifieds will probably be up tommorow along with a submit
your own links section.  Please send me any feedback or errors you might get
or if you think i should change something some.  Im always up for
suggestions.
