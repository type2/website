Subject: sliding door rear support

Just a quick note to thank all of you who responded to my inquiries 
last week with good advice and also offers to supply needed parts.

In particular, thank you Ted Kitch. Ted responded to my inquiry about 
the rear support nearly instantaneously, and then sent me a spare rear 
support at no charge. My sliding door is now installed and functioning 
properly. Thanks Ted for your generousity.

I'm really pleased to have this problem resolved, especially before the 
all day rain forecasted for tomorrow. The car looks great too.

Rob Mead
