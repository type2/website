If you are into file sharing it is out there in vast quantity. Try eDonkey 
for one. It's about 550 MB so be prepared for a long download.

The ones I have seen cover the whole VW fleet 1949 to current and contains 
the catalog that the parts counter guy (or gal) uses. It contains basic 
drawings and part numbers. Good to use when you don't know if you are 
missing some pieces. Contains Audi, Seat, Skoda, VW, etc.

Imagine an electronic parts fiche. Good to be able to print out the 
drawings sometimes. It also lists fastener sizes since you could buy them 
over the counter too I suppose. Print out the pics, use and throwaway. 
Better to get them dirty and greasy than the Bentley manual.

The newer the version has fewer of the old parts shown as they become 
obsolete and NLA. Consequently the newest version may not have the old 
parts us old bus drivers are interested in.

Is it available to the consumer? Nope. VW probably wouldn't want us to have 
that but it is wide use and availability if you know where to look.

Enjoy.

Would I pay for it? Nope. Would I sell it? Certainly not. Wouldn't that be 
illegal? &lt;grin&gt;

I hear the big auction site has them and they may even be real. Remember 
the newer ones may not show the older parts.
