&gt;I think your problem here is that '71 Westys came with an icebox, NOT a
&gt;fridge.  So if you're waiting for it to cool on it's own, it may take awhile.
&gt;Late Oct./early Nov. in these parts, at least...  ;-)

Pat,

Almost all '71s in the U.S. have coolers, but there are a few European
Westfalias that made it to the U.S. that had an original fridge (I believe
the fridge brand name is Electrolux). I don't know how well these work or if
you can still get parts over in Europe for these.  If anyone would like to
describe their 71 fridge and tell us how well it works I'd be interested and
I'm sure other 71ers would be curious.
