Subject: Re: Headlight relays install grounding questions,

Hi Kevin,

Your local electronics or automotive electric supplier should stock  
&quot;piggyback&quot; spade connectors. These little critters work just like  
regular female spade connectors except they have a male connector that  
allows a second female spade to be connected to the same post.

Here's a line drawing of one:

You can see one in use here:

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; Well I'm just about finished installing my headlight relays but...   
&gt; I'm out
&gt; of grounds on my posts.  Can I just use those circle type connectors  
&gt; and
&gt; drill a screw holding them togeather to the body right near the ground  
&gt; wheel
&gt; or should I find another ground post wheel and install that?
