those CB performance solexes have a vacuum port on the drivers side
carb. it exits away from the center of the engine as well. The web
site is really vauge about the details, and the email responces from
them are many times non existant. However for the money (at least on
my upright engine) this was a very good buy for me. I really enjoy
these carbs.
