Subject: Re: Help identifying P&amp;C

&gt;They look just like the P&amp;Cs on my type 4 engines, but no book I 
&gt;have shows a 96mm option.  The excuses that I can come up with 

Those were sold as a big-bore kit for type IV motors and were pretty popular 
among the 914 crowd who wanted more from their 1.7 or 1.8 motors.  The increase 
in displacement isn't really enough for 2.0 owners to bother with (I'm not sure 
the piston skirts would clear the rods with the longer stroke in a 2.0).  
Pretty good quality for aftermarket, but not as good as original Mahles in my 
opinion.
