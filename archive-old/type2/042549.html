Yes they are all the same. You should really use new CV joints wherever
possible. If you are using used joints make sure that there is no sign of
wear at all, the boots were not split and there is no dirt in the joints.
Try and clean all the old grease out and repack with new grease before and
after they have been fitted.

Here in the UK you can get 4 x German made CVs, 4 x boots and new grease for
about $180. Try someone like Ron at BusDepot_dot_com
