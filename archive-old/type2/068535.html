I spoke with a friend who just got off the phone with these folks.
They said they have a 59 ambulance, a Dbl Cab and a Single Cab amongst
their flock that will be slaughtered by the crusher (my words).  I hope it
is not a clearance sale ploy to get folks to come to their 'remote'
location.

I am not interested in pursuing these.  I am at my 'hoarding' limit!
It's about a 6 hour drive one-way from where I am at.  They are worth 
looking into though if it is feasible to fetch them somehow.
