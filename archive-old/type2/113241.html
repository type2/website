Subject: Stuck in 2nd...

While I was sitting at the stoplight I tried to shift from 4th back into 
1st. It seemed to get stuck in neutral. I could get it into reverse, but no 
forward gears. I finally fiddled with it enough to get it into 2nd. Luckily 
I didn't live far so I could drive her home in that gear. Now she's stuck 
in that gear.

She's a 1971 with a tranny from a 1969.  Has anyone had this problem. Is it 
a tough fix?
