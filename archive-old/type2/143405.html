Hi Volks,

Just over a year ago I pulled apart a 411 engine that had sat for 25  
years. It was a rebuilt bought from VW Canada that had been driven  
for a week before the vehicle was  totalled. It had been stored in a  
barn ever since.

The cheese-head screws were all well rusted into the tin. A big  
screwdriver turned with vice-grips would move about 1 in 5, but the  
rest were solid in place. PB-blaster was little help.

The answer for us was to heat them up with a propane torch and quench  
them with a candle. The wax wicked into the threads and they would  
then spin out with very little torque required. It worked like magic,  
and they ALL came out easily as a result.

We replaced them all with 10mm hex-head M6 bolts. They don't look  
stock, but they don't argue when it's time to get them off, either.

Who in God's name allowed the krauts to use flat bladed screw's for that

Whoever it was should be lined up against a wall and shot--dead, morto,
finito.
I had to use the impact driver on every one of them ( seemed like a
hunded of them.)

Then someone before you took that engine out, apart, and put it back  
together using type 1 engine screws. I
see it all the time.

You can just about know a type 4 engine has not been screwed with  
when you see it still has all its original
cheesehead screws.  When I see all straight slot screws, I cringe  
knowing it is a basketcase inside. Ususally
the case says GEX under the tin......


Happy trails,
