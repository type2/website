Subject: Casualty! was :Starting an engine after 22 years.

Hi Volks,

Thanks for all the replies! No,  I did not blow up my engine, just got a
trip to the emergency room.  The story: I had my tools, oil ,and all
tune up parts laid out and ready to go, but I got distracted and decided
to try out some Tuff Stuff spot and stain remover on the seats.  While
scrubbing away, I hear a pop and realize that the tip of my middle
finger was pointing down and I could not straighten it.  What dumb
luck!  I went in and told my wife that I was off to the emergency room.
She looked me up and down to see if I was missing any parts. I did not
mean to frighten her.  At the emergency room, I was asked how I hurt
myself and I replied cleaning.  The nurse exclaimed God bless you!  I
wanted to take credit for cleaning the house and receive the Husband off
the Millennium Award, but I fessed up that I was cleaning my bus.  Well,
it looks like I tore my flexor tendon and will have to see a hand
specialist on Monday.  This really bums me out because  the finger is on
my right hand and will make writing on a black board and working on  VWs
very tough.  I'll keep you all posted on the buses progress.
