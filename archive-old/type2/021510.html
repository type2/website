Whoa, you think a tight spring causes leaness?  Also, I thought the idle
adjust screw on the AFM only controls bypass air used to run at idle and
should not affect running at speed??  I know that the resistance (the
little arm rubbing on the resistance board) experienced at a given level
of air flow controls the eventual mix- ie, you are measuring air flow
based on the air pressure pulling the vane open, which is based on the
throttle opening.   The more air coming in, the more the rubbing arm
moves and increases the distance(resistance) from rest.  Move that arm
towards rest and it won't go as far for a given amount of air and you
could adjust the mix that way.  The vane does not control air intake, it
only measures it.  Now if the spring is tight or has friction,  wouldn't
it take a higher flow, or more air to get the same reading- hence a lean
result by the &quot;fooled&quot; brain?  If the spring gets weak, then less air is
used to open the vane as far, and hence, a rich mix?  I'd think someone
out there can put a strain gauge on the vane of a good AFM and check
grams of force to produce say, 2 cm of opening?  Take the afm and fasten
a thread to the edge of the vane and mount it so you can hang a weight
from it and keep adding weight until it opens a certain amount??  Sean
B, what's your take?  BTW, what's being measured as the vane opens- the
increasing resistance between home and the arm, or the decreasing
resistance between the arm and maximum opening???

&gt; tight.  I'm wondering because I have an almost brand new rebuilt AFM that
