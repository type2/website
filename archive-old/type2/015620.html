&gt;Has anyone ordered form Bus Depot?

Probably only about half (500) on this list have bought from Ron.

&gt;
&gt;Can you tell me of your experience?

Ordered a pair of carburators. One was obviously damaged, probably before
it was put in the box. This tells me that they don't look at the parts
before they buy them or sell them. Who else does??

Refered a client who ordered rotors and pads for a Vanagon. Seller
could/would not identify manufacturer, only they were European. Received
Brembos and Pagid. Good stuff, half the cost normal aftermarket suppliers
and 1/4 the cost of dealer rotors.

My impression of Ron is he is a nose to the grindstone type, strong work
ethic, but human, like the rest of us. His overall service is average or
better. He does have parts from time to time that are NLA otherwise, and
typically at lower cost than the market will allow. I wish he would charge
more when so warrented so he could hire higher skilled help to improve
communications time lags. He is better than most at follow up and follow
through, but it can take several days to get a responce. 

With all suppliers, do ask about sources. From another supplier I once got
one German and 3 Chinese bearings as a SET, and all at the German cost.
Frankly, some of the Mexican and Brazillian VW parts are pure junk, not
cheap, and cannot be installed or will not function properly and do damage.
The clutch cross shaft is one example. Some are so out of tolerance that
they will break your new German clutch (if you know how to find one) in
short order. Reworking your German parts here and elsewhere is always to be
considered strongly as an alternative with much better potential results.

Always inspect all parts immediatly upon arrival. Get the
return/replacement hassels out of the way before scheduling the work. When
picking names of unknown suppliers from the web or Hemmings or Yellow
Pages, expect about a 50% success rate in having good communications and
the right parts the first time. Guys like Ron improve this success rate
tremendously, but if he is hitting 95%, that certainly can leave a few
orders weekly that go wrong somehow. 

Rule of thumb, stay away from full page flashy 4 color+ magazine ads. Only
the bottom feeders keep them in the black.
