Subject: Re: engine running on 2cyls?

Don't know if this is related or not but it will help some people.
I bought a bus that had a rebuilt engine.  For some bizarre engine the 
distributor was 180 degrees out!  Adjusting the valeve the correct way by 
viewing #1 nothc on the distrib actually meant that they were all wrong.  The 
bus wouldn't run right. Once Ifigured this out everything was fine.  I've 
seen this on a couple of VWs.  Can a distrib gear be put in backwards? Is 
this something related to the crank gears?  Who can tell me the answer?
