Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Mexican longblock&quot; - CR? HP?

I'm using the same Solex 34 PICT 3.  I fiddled with the idle bypass
screw (the big one on the side) to bring the idle down a little bit.

I have a Brosol 31 PICT (with an adapter) that I could use, but I
believe the distributor is set up for the carb (I'm guessing they have
different vacuum signals).

I had been happy with the 009, but I'm doing everything I can for the
sake of longevity, and it seems the SVDA should boost my odds for a
longer lasting engine.

Maybe I need to learn how to drive the SVDA, though theoretically, they
are supposed to be idiot proof - just floor it and it goes.  I had been
used to feathering the accelerator pedal through the &quot;flat spot.&quot;

&gt; That would be dished pistons, wouldn't it? Domed pistons INCREASE
&gt; compression.
&gt;
&gt; I'd go with playing with the carb. Especially if you replaced it with
&gt; the engine. If so, put your old one back on. Don't worry about the
&gt; 009. Wanna see if that helps? Plug the vacuum line. Instant 009!
&gt;
&gt; (Ok, not exactly an 009, but you get the idea...)
