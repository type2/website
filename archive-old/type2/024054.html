&lt;&lt; Bently says that the 
 engine should be at 10 ATDC, and by a quick look at someone elses scale 
 noticed that mine was down around 5-10 BTDC. &gt;&gt;

VW just did that to meet emitions... in reality no engine should be timed 
after tdc,  (anti knock sensors probably retard timeing this far though thats 
a different story though) im probably wrong, any other reason to time 
something btdc? anyway, the further you advance your timeing the more power 
you get (dont go setting it to 50 atdc, it'll shake it self to pieces), but 
it will run hotter and be more likely to ping. The stock setting for my 
engine is 5 after, i have it set at tdc or  5 before, somewhere around 
there....
