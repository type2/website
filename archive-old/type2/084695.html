&gt; &gt; &gt;In the 10 years I've owned my bus, I've burned rings 3x and lost valves

&gt; &gt; I suspect the add on oil cooler. Not enough volume coming off the crank to
&gt; &gt; splash the backs of the pistons and cool them. The extra friction loss of
&gt; &gt; add on coolers and hoses tends to overwhelm the oil pumps capacity, hence,
&gt; &gt; less flow at the crank, less splash to cool the pistons.
&gt;
&gt;Would my head temp sensor give me an indication of this?

Not necessarily. You appear to have a cylinder/piston temp issue. It's 
either that or something else creating poor lubrication.


&gt;I am inclined to lose the add on oil cooler. Although it has dramaticlly
&gt;reduced my oil temp, the survival rates of my engines seem to speak for
&gt;themselves.

Where is the oil temp sender?? Down in the pan?? With too little splash 
running off the back of the pistons it would surely mean less heat when 
mixed in the pan with the cooler oil from everywhere else. I would be 
interested in how much black burned oil is found on the back of the piston 
with the blown ring. If things are right, there never will be a build up of 
varnish much less hard carbon black burned oil residues. It should remain 
always as clean as the day it was assembled if the lube interval is 
appropriate for the conditions of use.
