Subject: RE: Parts Failure Survey and Speedo Question

Some of these I can vouch for personally

&gt;fuel line (failure causes bus to burn to the ground)

Haven't had that happen yet, but I'm currently replacing the fuel lines.
It's a cheap price for peace of mind.

&gt;starter solenoid wiring (failure to install a Bosch WR1 relay kit causes bus
&gt;not to start when hot)

I had a solenoid problem that seemed similar to this for a long time ---
I'd get out in the middle of nowhere (the parking lot at my office was a
common place, as was the gas station I usually visit on the way), park the
bus, and then be unable to restart it. The only common elements in these
situations were that it would usually start fine the first time each day
and refuse to start on subsequent occasions, and I was almost always parked
facing uphill. I checked and rechecked (or so I thought) all the wiring,
tested the solenoid and starter, etc., and was under the bus, getting ready
to pull the starter and solenoid, when I noticed that the little slide-on
clip on the solenoid was loose. I cleaned the connectors and tightened the
clip with my trusty needle-nose pliers, and it has worked fine since.

&gt;rust under windshield (if you see it, there's probably much more you can't
&gt;see under the seal)

I pulled my front window a couple of weeks ago and ground off all the rust.
I found a number of sizeable holes and noted that the window gasket rim was
eaten away in a few places. Inevitably, I will have to have this cut out
and replaced with fresh metal, but in the meantime I coated it with POR-15,
patched the holes with Bondo (I know, I know, but I'm playing for time),
repainted and reinstalled the window. More accurately, I had to have the
window professionally installed, because the seal I got from RMMW was a
touch too thick. I've been happy with the other seals (pop-top, luggage
rack, door seals, etc.) that I've gotten from RMMW, but I think I'm going
to stick to WCM (via the Bus Depot) for window seals from now on.

Another couple of prime rust locations are under the sliding door rail
cover and its decorative twin on the other side of the bus. The inside of
the covers tend to rust over with a thoroughness that is really impressive
while leaving the outside deceptively untouched. By the time this happens,
the screws are rusted in really good as well. I used my Dremel to cut a new
notch in the screw heads after Liquid Wrench, drilling, hammering, and
screaming and cursing (in no particular order) failed. It was then that I
discovered substantial rust creeping out under the adjoining window seal.
The rail covers are fairly easy to fix, if time consuming --- I just ground
off all the paint and rust, neutralized the rust, painted the underside
with POR-15, topped off with a dust-coating of primer (without which paint
is loath to adhere to POR-15). I then primed the front and painted the
whole thing. I'm still working on the rest of it.

The area on the roof that is in direct contact with luggage rack seal is
worth checking. When I pulled the rack to replace the seal, I discovered
the telltale bubbling of the paint in a few spots. When I ground off the
paint, I found tiny rust patches under areas that had not yet bubbled, so I
proceeded all the way around the path of the seal and found plenty of rust
that would have become a serious problem in a year or two.

The doglegs over the front wheel wells are also rust magnets. Mine have big
holes in them, earning them a trip to my friendly neighborhood welder,
ASAP. Battery pans go without saying. Mine is rust free only because it is
an aftermarket plywood part. The rain gutters are also prone to rust for
obvious reasons, and as they look like they would be difficult and
therefore expensive to replace, I'd keep an eye on them. The front air
intake behind the grille can also get pretty nasty.
