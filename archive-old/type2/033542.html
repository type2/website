&gt;higher altitude=less oxygen per liter of air.  So i thought, when one goes
&gt;to high altitude you need to _lean_ out the mixture as the higher you go
&gt;the ammount of fuel metered stays constant, but the oxygen content
&gt;decreases as you ascend.  then, logically, one would need to lean out the
&gt;carb to match the changed oxygen content of the air.  

It depends on what type of fuel system you have.  My knowledge of the bus
FI systems is a little thin, but I'll take a stab at it anyway:

Carbs cannot adjust for altitude and will therefore run richer as elevation
increases.  

D-Jet fuel injection is similar in that it cannot determine how thin the
air is.  Additionally, I would guess (no real world experience here) that
it would run even richer at idle in high elevation than a carb, since with
this system, fuel pressure varies inversely with manifold pressure, and
there will be less manifold pressure (approx. 1 in per 1,000 ft) at idle at
higher elevations.

L-Jet fuel injection has a mass-air meter which accurately measures the
amount of air going into the engine regardless of the elevation.  This
system will not run rich at high altitude like the previous two.

&gt;From this, it looks like the L-Jet would be the only one that might benefit
from having the mixture enriched at high altitudes.  The D-Jet would need
to be leaned out, and there is nothing you could do about a carb short of
changing jet sizes.

Ian, I saw a guy with exactly what you describe at Busses on the Blue Ridge
a couple of years ago.  He had an Oxygen sensor in his tailpipe with a
digital readout in the dash, and a rheostat running back to his temp
sender.  He claimed it worked very well, although I don't know how he
determined what &quot;well&quot; was.
