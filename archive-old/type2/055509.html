Subject: Re: body work, mig welders, etc...

I've used MILLER, LINCOLN,  LINDE, &amp; CENTURY units; not much difference between
them.

Although much debate has been had on the list, I find a 120 VAC unit is all you
need for body work on a car (van). I use a CENTURY 70 amp unit now. It has welded
everything I need to do, even up to 1/4&quot; angle iron  frame works.

Get a unit set up for gas; C25 is the better gas for mild steel.

The only way to get any good at it is to play with it. Burn a couple of pounds of
wire on junk metal and you will learn fast enough.
