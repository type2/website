Do you think it might be a good idea to meet at VW Euro in September? It
is held in the south of The Netherlands. It's a very big event with
losts of aircooled VW's from a lot of North European countries.

I am travelling with my van to Eastern Europe very soon. Austria,
Slovakia, Hungary, perhaps even Croatia and Slovenia. Are there any list
members over there?

By the way, I come from Leeuwarden, The Netherlands
