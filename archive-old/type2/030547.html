Hi clara,

well, to be frank... i could always see black soot where the heater donuts
developed leaks... there was no smell per se in the heat, just my monoxide
detector would start rising in number and beep eventually (never let it
get that far.) i think that these leaks were shooting into the heating
system somehow, though i cant say exactly how... but when i couldnt see
the black soot leaks, then the monoxide detector didnt go off...

&gt; ?  wonder if the tubes you put in to help mate the heater box to muffler 
&gt; resticts exhaust flow and if so what that does to the motor?

Hmm, good question.  More backpressure gives greater low end torque and
lower high end horsepower, so its a change i can probably live with
;) though the restriction in ID probably isnt that much, ... maybe not
good for a big 1835+ motor. (i've never had over a 1600 personally) Might
necessitate a jet change.... i am unsure, though that wasnt the case here.

take care,

Steve
