I like this idea of Charlie's, and I like Mike Gensler's variations.

Yesterday I was thinking somewhat tangentially, in response to Joe 
Clark's e-mail about going to Jerome, that it would be nifty to somehow 
come up with a railroad flatcar, modified so that 15-20 buses could be 
tied down on it. East coast people could make it to Jerome, west coast 
people to BBTA and points east, and it would be a gas on the flatbed. But 
this idea is really halfbaked. Don't even know if it would be legal, let 
alone affordable.
