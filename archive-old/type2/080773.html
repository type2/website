Nope, the only reason people use bug mufflers is to cheap out, not for fit
or performance. The type 2 muffler exhausts to the side to put nasty
combustion byproducts in the slipstream and away from the inside of your
car. Bus =shaped like brick
+bug muffler=co thru leaky hatch seals. Also depending on year, to make em
fit finds you bending either the muffler or rear apron. Or worse, cutting
the apron and being cursed for all eternity , joining the DPO league. If you
must cheap out, at least throw on a QP extractor.

&gt; The muffler you have is a bug muffler and is preferred by many. It is
&gt; cheaper and I think has better qualities than the single pipe version.

&gt; OK folks, while my engine is out for the gas tank repair, I am also going
&gt; to replace my muffer on the 71 westy (1600 DP).  The current muffler on it
&gt; is the one with 2 exhaust outlets (pea shooter?).  Looking through parts
&gt; catalogs, I see that all the bus mufflers for a 71 have just the 1 exhaust
&gt; outlet.  So, do I currently have a Bug muffler? If so, are there any
&gt; reasons I should NOT replace it with a new Bug muffler of the same style
or
&gt; would I be much better off going with the proper single exhaust bus
&gt; muffler.  The version I currently have seems to be considerably cheaper,
so
&gt; that's one advantage of the 2 exhaust version.  All opinions appreciated!
&gt;
&gt;
