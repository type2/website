Subject: VW-SLIDING DOOR HINGE REPLACEMENT
Message-Id: &lt;199906152038.NAA10176_at_judge.rand_dot_org&gt;

My '71 Type II's sliding door's upper rear hinge (the sliding thing with
the U-shaped connection) seems to be broken.  The fixed door side of the U
&quot;joint&quot; appears to have been snapped off somewhere (the front half of the
U can be slid into the gizmo on the door but it won't stay there).  What's
the deal with putting a new one on?  Does the assembly just bolt on the
door after you get the runner on the body track?  Do I need to replace the
whole door?

If the U-joint assembly is removable, will all 68 and beyond Type IIs serve
as good sources for junk yard replacements?

The reason why I'm asking is that I just noticed the limply hanging
u-joint and instead of opening the door to look closer, I figured it would
be best to wire everything shut until I had a plan of action.

Mucho thanx for any suggestions,


Nick
