In my old Chevy V8 days, we always said that a quart a thousand
was acceptable.  So a pint every 500 probably isn't too bad.

&gt; &gt; Let me guess, there is oil all over the back of the van.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My guess is a broken ring on one or more pistons causing
&gt; &gt; blow by.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It may go another 10,000 or more miles with out a problem
&gt; &gt; (other than adding oil ;-})
&gt;
&gt;         Hm. How much oil loss is &quot;acceptable&quot;? I probably put in half a
&gt; pint every 500 miles, maybe more. 'Course, that ain't a quart, but it's
&gt; enough to make me suspicious.
