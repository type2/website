Subject: Re: Pertronics adjustment

Here's an issue I have never heard others talk about.

What you are &quot;seeing&quot; is the removal of the points. This also means you have
removed the points DRAGGING on the distributor's rotor, which is coupled to
the centrifugal advance mechanism.

In short, your centrifugal advance mechanism is sticking, and the points
used to provide a little drag to return it to &quot;zero&quot;, but you have removed
it with the Pertronix install. Time to tear your distributor down and clean
and lube the advance.
