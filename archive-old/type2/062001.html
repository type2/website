&gt; hey now,
&gt; 
&gt; just wondering if anyone has some opinions on installing a distributor that
&gt; has a governor that prevents the engine from going over a certian rpm. they
&gt; are about $30-$40 and i've heard they are good to have. seems like a good idea
&gt; to me. small price to pay to protect your engine. but i'd like to hear from
&gt; the vw gurus on the list....
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,

&gt; jonathan '74 RetroWestie (Ru/\/\ba)I don't know why you would bother with a govenor, unless you plan on 
racing your rig. If you are concerned with overrevving, I'd spend the 
money on a tach.

In '65, VW equipped their vans w/ a cheap governor, to prevent 
overrevving while the engine was in break-in. It consisted of a spring 
in the rotor. When RPMs got above a certain point, it would short 
(open?) the rotor, and you couldn't get the engine above the &quot;safe&quot; 
operating speed.

After 30 years, mom still complains about the ticket she got in our 
Deluxe. She says she was in 3rd gear, and there's no way she could have 
been going faster than the posted 35 mph.
