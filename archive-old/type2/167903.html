Subject: Re: [T2] Can we weld new exhaust manifold flanges on our heater
  boxes?

  Hi, I also drive a '77 WESTY, and that's all I did, I welded new 
flanges right over the old ones( taking the time to make sure they were 
completely leak proof) didn't have any problems with clearance. A year 
later and still no leaks. Just bought the replacement flanges at 
California Imports.

&gt; My 77 Westy heater box flanges (the triangular shaped ones) are corroding badly, yet the boxes themselves are in very good condition. I was wondering if I could just weld new triangular flanges on where the old ones are? I thought the thickness of plate, added to the old ones wouldn't be much of a consideration in clearance or muffler problems. Any thoughts on this?
&gt; Thanks,
