Hey Frank!
Make sure you replace that fuel filter first.  Even though it may not look clogged, it still could be.  On my old 75 camper, this happened and I went through a bunch of other stuff trying to find my problem, and it ended up just being that little $1.99 filter.  Other possible culprits: bad fuel pump, dead coil, clogged fuel line (ask me how I know about all these!!!)  If you've got Muir's Idiot's Guide it has a great troubleshooting chapter for when your bus stops or won't start, that gives you step by step things to check and how to check them.  I find it helpful to use this Guide along with the Haynes Manual, the Idiot's guide gives you easy laymans terms and explanations while the Haynes manual gives you REAL pictures of what you're looking at.  Good luck, I hope it's minor!
Peace, John BAker

Hi All,
Well Happy finally left me walking.  It sat for a week, ran fine before,
but last night developed a slight sputter.  This morning, the sputter
became worse and finally quit.  Upon inspection, I find the fuel filter
is dry.
I am looking for ideas of where to check first.  I am referring to the
filter leading into carb.  But you probably guessed that!
Thanx in advance
FEBIII
71 Happy Bus
