My guess is that you've popped one of the oil gallery plugs.  Not an
uncommon problem.  Not an expensive fix *IF* you do it yourself. 
But... the bad news is that the engine's gotta come out to fix it.
Then the fan shroud has to come off.  (Which means that it's the ideal
time to replace the hanger bar motor mounts (about $7.00 ea IIRC) ) 
Domino theory at work!  

If you haven't got a Bentley/Haynes now's the time!
