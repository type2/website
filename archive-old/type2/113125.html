Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Problems?

Re clutch chatter- I have this twice, and it was due to 2 diffferent
reasons: 1. A spring in the clutch plate had broken- I usually just
pushed the clutch pedal in and let it out again and it would be ok. 2.
The lining on one side had separated and was binding in areas, causing
grabbing.
