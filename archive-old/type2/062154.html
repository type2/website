Subject: cleaning canvas

I don't know what the Westfalia pop-top canvas is made of, whether acrylic or
cotton.  But I know that cotton is easily weakened and rotted by bleach.  A mild
treatment with bleach followed by a good rinse can eliminate fungus and mildew
and protect against bioligical causes of rot, but too strong or sustained a
treatment will be bad for the canvas...John Jensen in Annapolis
