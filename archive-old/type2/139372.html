Subject: Center steering column bolt.

Well since its -17F here it looks like my ignition lock cylinder has 
finally bitten the dust, cant turn the key that precious last notch to 
spark my '73 up. I got my hands on a new one with keys to throw in 
there for now. I'm not stoked on more than one key but thats another 
story.

So I was just out there thinking I would pull it all off real quick to 
work inside and I find that I definitely don't have a socket that is 
going to fit that sucker, my 24mm and my 1inch sockets are too small to 
remove that wheel hold down bolt in the center of the wheel. I could 
have sworn I had the right size in my toolkit but obviously not. What 
size is that center bolt at the top of steering column on a '73? 26mm ?

I am guessing it will be a trip to the store tomorrow to buy the right 
size, so if someone can tell me what that size is that would make me 
freezing my nadgers off less painful when I go outside again. Why oh 
Why did I buy a house with a garage that wont fit the daily driver 
Safare in ?

Steve
