Subject: THANKS! (was: VW-NEED BRAKE BOOSTER INFO ASAP!)

A thousand thanks to Karl von Salzen &lt;aufever_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt; and Joseph
Fournier &lt;jfournier_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt; who gave me the answer to my question
about wierd braking going on at high RPMs.  I had thought there was some
complicated problem with the brake servo on my '71 Type II since it was
experiencing reduced power at high speeds and up hills but only with the
brake booster line attached to the manifold (and there were no detectable
vaccum leaks or pedal movement and it idled just fine).  This suggested
some sort of failure of the internal valves to close or open as needed and
that meant at least $250 for a rebuilt servo.

Thankfully, the light of reason asserted itself and these two gentlemen
sent me a personal response with the simple idea that the problem might
lie in the connection between the pedal and the servo.  Sure enough, I
wound up having to drive out the bolt out of the clevis since even in the
upright pedal position, the connecting rod was jammed a bit into the
servo.  This resulted in the internal valves being opened slightly and at
high RPM, quite a bit of undesired braking was going on.  I never saw any
pedal travel because even in the neutral position, there was braking
already taking place.  Not enough to turn on the brake lights or cause
freeze up when sitting in my car port but enough to become bothersome when
the engine vacc sucked enough to drive the piston further into the master
cylinder.  The holes in the connecting rod clevis and the pedal hinge were
a quarter inch apart; that's a huge amount.  I screwed in the connecting
rod into the servo to the point where the clevis bolt slid in without
resistance and BINGO!  Everthing runs great.

What bothers me is that I had taken my Bus to Winston Tires in Santa
Monica last week for a &quot;complete&quot; brake system inspection and specifically
told them to check out the booster system.  They said everything booster
related was just fine (though they hit me up for new discs, pads, yadda
yadda yadda...).  One would think that a brake job that cost hundreds of
dollars would include a simple check of the freeplay in the pedal-servo
connection.  Alas, this proves that the ultimate authority for what is
right for our beasts with 350,000 miles on them and 30 year old technology
is, in the final analysis, ourselves....

Anyway, thanks again for the help.  I'll shut up now.


Nick
