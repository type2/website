James. does that make the info in the Hoover Sermons NLA?

&quot;Universal Corportation 730 Independent Avenue Grand Junction, CO 81505
Tel (970)242-5267&quot;(Yes, thatOs the correct Area Code. It is one of the new
ones.)
A call to Universal put me in touch with Mrs Eileen Iles, who told me they
were waiting on new tooling for the extruded aluminum case (which also
serves as the heat sink for the module). The delay had disrupted only that
one model and she expected it to be back into production (and back in J. C.
WhitneyOs catalog) in the near future, promising to let me know so I could
pass the word.&quot;
