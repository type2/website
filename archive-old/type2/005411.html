Subject: My analoge clock has stopped
Message-ID: &lt;00d201be92f6$0de3de00$32c060cb_at_hildougb..igrin.co.nz.&gt;

I took the stopped analoge clock out of my bus to clock and instrument
repair people. They all
declared that it was unfixable.

I had a look at it myself, the clockwork mechanism works fine but the coil
that winds it up is burnt out.

Can anyone  provide me with a coil, or know where I can get one?

If I cant obtain one I will try to rewind the one I have - but there is an
electronic
device connected between each end of the coil.  It has also over heated so
that I can not see the colours that used to be on it.  My limited knowledge
tells me that it is a resistor,  but logic tells me it could well be a
condenser.  Can anyone please help me identify what it is and its
specifications.
