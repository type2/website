They should be next to the bumper. In 1972 VW moved the turn signals
up next to the air intake. However, I did once own a 1971 bus that
had the newer style front turn signals. That has always been a mystery 
to me. Anybody know the story on that? The rear tail lights on that bus
were correct for 1971.
