Subject: Re: [T2] VERY cold weather starting

IIRC, dipstick heaters are available for VW aircooled motors too.   My
58 bug had a heater that had an electric element in the plate on the
oil pan.

A more luxurious way yet is a recirculating coolant heater (requires a
water-cooled engine, of course).  The one in my wife's TDI golf gets
the engine warm enough that the temperature guage on the dash is
already part way to normal when the engine starts, and warm air is
blowing out of the heater.

With my bus, I've had the best luck with a trickle charger that
ensures the battery is fully charged and slightly warm - it starts at
-40 (C or F).  5w30 oil also helps.  Uses a lot less energy than the
recirculating coolant heater.
