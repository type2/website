Subject: Re: '79 Engine in an '81

&gt;    Don't know about that, I've used the '73 alternator on the '81 fan
&gt;housing in my '73 bus. And also used the '81 alternator minus the fan
&gt;(no room) in my bus.
&gt;
Interesting.  Well if you've done it I guess it works :-)
I know the Vanagon alternator is different from the Bus alternator but I 
suppose if you can get the two mounting holes in the Vanagon alternator 
to line up with the bracket and adjuster on the Bus fan housing, you 
could get it to work.




&gt;     What a &quot;proper installation&quot; consists of for some people on the
&gt;list is clearly different for others. Depends on whether you are doing 
a
&gt;&quot;restoration&quot; or just looking for a ride. My bus is ride.

Mine is too.  A restoration it ain't.  But to have a reliable and 
durable ride you've got to have a mechanically sound engine.  An engine 
with an improperly fitted cooling system that doesn't do what VW 
intended it to do is not mechanically sound.


 You're making the same
&gt;arguement that others do about &quot;if the VW engineers in their infinite
&gt;wisdom designed it that way, we should follow suit.&quot; So therefore,
&gt;putting extractors on our buses, Weber carbs, whatever, is bad, bad,
&gt;bad. Not! 

That's exactly the argument I'm making and I will agree that Weber carbs 
and extractors are certainly bad.  But I believe in stock big-time.


&gt;    I'll agree that a sealed up engine compartment is a good thing -- 
it
&gt;keeps all the slush, water from puddles, mud, leaves, and other crap
&gt;out. Or maybe it's real purpose is to help you float when you hit the
&gt;water -- which is what they used to say about the bugs. 8-) 
&gt;    But for engine longevity, I'll worry more about the essentials. 

Then I suppose you'd better worry about that tin.


My
&gt;last engine wasn't in a sealed compartment, and never got hot all last
&gt;Summer here in Mobile, AL -- 

I did a test with this.  My old '78 Bus had an oil temperature gauge 
installed.  When I got the Bus it had a very poorly installed a/c 
compressor.  Whoever did it hacked the left rear tin pretty severely, 
and there was a big open spot there.  And that Bus ran hot.  After I 
rigged up something to block the gap, preventing hot air entering from 
below, I noticed a serious drop in oil temp.  That's all the proof I 
need.  Similar thing with the '75 Beetle I once had.  Idiot PO didn't 
have an engine seal in place.  This was before I knew enough about VWs 
to know that a sealed engine compartment was important.  That thing ran 
REALLY hot.  I know I killed that poor engine driving it around without 
that seal.  You say yours never got hot.  I disagree.  You just didn't 
notice how hot it got.
