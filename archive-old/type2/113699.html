Subject: Re: [T2] Overhead AC

Underdash yes, overhead in the front no, overhead in the rear yes if you 
ditched the rear cabinet.

Another option would be a/c for the front run by the compressor on the 
engine for mobile use, and the rear a/c hooked to a 120V compressor for a/c 
when you were on shore power. Hide the compressor under the seat or under 
the sink or in the closet. Certainly going to be a bit noisy I expect 
gauaging by the window units I am most familiar with.

&gt;All this talk of consoles and the pic that was posted got me thinking 
&gt;about the
&gt;stock overhead AC system for the bus. Does anybody know if it will fit in a
&gt;Westy?
