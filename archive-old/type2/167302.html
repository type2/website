  this....WRONG, Now: Brake backing plate

&gt; So my question is; Is this a backing plate from another VW (bug,

&gt; case that I
&gt; have to replace the Brake backing plate? They both look pretty  
&gt; crusty, but the
&gt; metal is all good, with no major rust, just surface rust.

VW changed the hardware mid 74 (VIN 214 2057 730) and eliminated the  
hole. You'll also find a lot of backing plates for sale (Brazil,  
Germany) have these holes. It can get wet back there so cover up the  
holes.

IIRC, Dolan once told me that he preferred not to use the retaining  
springs even on the older models. He used to be the brake guru when  
he was active on the list.
