Subject: Re: Trans question

&gt; In my 70' Kombi I have a late type trans that looks, and performs well. =
&gt;However, oil leaks
&gt;out at the drive shafts. Looking at the Bentley manual, it would appear =
&gt;that the problem is=20
&gt;the oil seal around the axle shaft.
&gt; Questions...
&gt;1. Is this a relatively easy fix?
&gt;2. Does this indicate bigger problems? extreme age?
&gt;3. Am I better off using the other trans that I have had sitting around?
&gt;It too is of indeterminate mileage and has been sitting outside for =
&gt;about 15 years.
&gt;
&gt;Thanx, Jako

jako, have heart: very easy fix even if tranny is in. there is a fabulous
write up on the procedure in the library. take this link and scroll down
about half way http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/transmis.htm
the outer caps cost about $3 each, seals about $4.50; as far as tools you
really only need a philips screwdriver and the correct circlip remover. a
real small dull ice pick sorta tool will enable you to pull and reuse those
blue $3 caps. i took mine apart two days ago for reconditioning. i cleaned
each side of the tranny, and can check in a few thousand miles to see if it
was leaking fluid or was catching road crud. both sides with tranny out
took an hour total with cleaning and chatting - add 15 minutes to pull and
replace the seals.

if you are leaking fluid i don't think its a sign of a problem, just worn
seal. is your fluid level norml? use the same tranny if you're not
experiencing other symptoms.   - steve
