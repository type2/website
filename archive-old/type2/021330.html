Grant,
I think you miss 3/4 of the point. 1/2 of the kick of the dual advance comes
from the retard section and it is NOT turned off. It gives an immediate 12
degrees punch when the throttle is opened.
PLUS, most miles occur in 4th gear, and the advance was always on in 4th.
Also, this vac advance cutoff system was not used on the 74's with manual
tranmissions, just 72 and 73 and all 3 years with automatic (Not real sure about
the automatics)

&gt; Well, like every other up to date VW person I have gotten religion on the
&gt; subject of vac advance, and its superior ability to respond to load not just
&gt; RPM.  Now I find that  (at least here in the balmy latitudes) it was turned
&gt; off most of the time.  Saint Hoover save us!  Should I doubt my faith?
