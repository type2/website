Subject: Case cleaning and Cam for carbs

My method for cleaning air-cooled engine cases has been to use generic WD-40 
type spray on the crusted black crud to soften if and carefully scrape most 
of it off and then to use a tooth brush and spray to loosen up the rest. I 
don't like using gasoline because of fumes, safety and it turns your hands 
white.

My 75 engine had a lot of baked-on stuff especially the heat-baked layer of 
oil residue inside the case. I also tried the spray-on foaming cleaner which 
was only moderately successful. I really think a clean case makes an engine 
rebuild look way better than a half-baked cleaning job and it's much easier 
to chase oil leaks.

I could pay the machine shop to dunk and clean my case but I'm never sure 
what else has been dunked before my case. It then occured to me that I had a 
gallon size can half-full of carb cleaner left over from a 356 Zenith carb 
rebuild. That stuff is really hot stuff so don't get any on you or in your 
eyes. I lightly coated the crusty surface with a paint brush, let it sit for 
a few minutes, and it works great!! I sprayed the WD-40 stuff to neutralize 
the carb cleaner and wiped the case down with an old t-shirt. A second 
application will be needed for the few places that were not completely 
cleaned. That stuff works really well.

Since I'm going to dual carbs and need to buy a cam--does anybody have a 
recommendation for a source for a carb-based cam grind over the FI-cam? Not 
looking for hotrod stuff but thought the cam should fit the job.
