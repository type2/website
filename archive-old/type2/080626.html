Subject: Interior re-upholstery questions

Hello all.

We made a trip to a local upholstery supplier and shopped for colors and 
patterns on Saturday.

Can anyone advise me how many yards of fabric I need to re-upholster the 
front seats, front door panels, sliding door panel, rear hatch panel, and 
rear Z-bed, and upper mattress pads in a 1978 Westfalia?

Any patterns in circulation? I plan to use my existing upholstery for 
patterns I guess.

Lastly - the curtains. How many yards for that project?

Thanks all.

Chris in Cookeville, TN
