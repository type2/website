Hi,

&gt; I already bought 1 Conti Contact (CS21?) in a 205/65/15 and 
&gt; mounted it on
&gt; the 6x15 Fuchs. It looks great and fits (*barely* in the back 
&gt; with the 1&quot; adapters)...

 Can you let me know the Load Index for these?
 
&gt; However, I'm hesitant about using the adapters. Everytime I 
&gt; check them,
&gt; usually after only 10 miles (round trip to work) the lug nuts 
&gt; come off with
&gt; less torque than I used to fasten them!

 Are you sure this is unexpected? If you try to re-torque them, have
the nuts slackened off?

&gt; ... one possibility is that the holes in the adapters are
&gt; not properly machined to
&gt; fit the spherical shape of the bus's lugnuts. The holes have 
&gt; more of a cone shape.
&gt; If anyone thinks that's a very likely reason, I may 
&gt; have a local machine shop correct that.

 I would think this is quite possible: You could get different 
wheelnuts, though, instead of getting the adapters machined?
 I expect a breakers yard could get you them for peanuts.

 I don't know how high-quality the adapters you are using are, but
with the German TUV people being happy to accept the use of some
units on high-performance vehicles I don't think the technology is
unworkable, if properly executed. I can see that poor-quality
adapters could lead to the problems described elsewhere, but that
needn't exclude all of them, and I suspect that your Fuchs with
good adapters would form a better system (stronger, lighter) than
my Mercs on their own.

Cheers,
	  W.
