Hi Michael,

I agree with the folks who say that gauges are inaccurate and are better 
used to monitor trends.  However, it's tough to tell what &quot;normal&quot; is if 
you've never used gauges in your Bus.  I have a 1979 Westy with a new T4 
2.0L FI tuned for 5,000-ft altitude.  So, here's a breakdown of what I see 
at normal highway speeds:

Speedo: 65-70 mph (indicated, pretty accurate)
Tach: 3700-3900 rpm
Oil press: 35-40 psi
Oil temp: 210-230 deg
Volts: 13-13.5 V (daytime with radio, no lights or wipers)

Oil temp reads higher if I'm heading up a slight hill at speed, and oil 
pressure drops as temp rises.  I've also noticed an &quot;overlap&quot; effect where 
my oil temp will climb for a little while after I crest the hill and head 
down the other side.  Also, I've noticed higher oil temps if the outside 
temp is higher, lower temps if it's lower.  Humidity also plays a part, as 
its evaporative effect affects the cooling ability of the air.

While you're installing gauges, you may want to put a cheap thermometer 
outside your Bus where you can see it from the driver's seat.  I clipped 
mine to the antenna, and can see it great.  Something to think about...

Good luck!
