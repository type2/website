Subject: Who has a full flowed upright engine on their bus?

I finally took delivery of my newly built, full flowed, single port doghouse
cooler 1776 for my 70 Bus today. I'm wondering if anyone can tell me how
they handled the barbed oil hose fitting that sticks out of the rear of the
engine block. I have 2 possible fittings, one is straight and the other is
90 degrees, and either of them interfere with the rear engine tin(the one
that goes around the pulley). The only way I can see is to cut a big hole in
the tin. What have other people done here? Also, do you teflon tape the
fitting into the block, or did I read somewhere that Berg recommends putting
it in metal to metal?
