Subject: replacement for Kadrons

I am about to pull the Kadrons off of the 1776 in my '71 Westy.  Several
reasons.  First and most important,   the lack of a choke makes the short
trip to work an unpleasant one during about six months of the year here in
Northern Virginia. Secondly,  the flat spot is an annoyance. Thirdly,  it
is just too difficult to reach the mixture screw and mounting bolts when
the engine is squeezed into the Westy.

I have read many posts that say that a 34PICT-3 is plenty of carb in a 1776
and I am leaning toward this because I am thoroughly familiar with it and
it has a choke.

My question is this:   Are there any other carbs that do have a choke and
that I might choose instead of the PICT-3?

Thanks, Jack
