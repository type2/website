Some portable toilets are much easier to empty than others.  We've gone
through 5 over a period of 20 years, and some were impossible to dump tidily
under any circumstances.

We now have a Sears Pakapotty [same as &quot;genuine&quot; Porta-potti] in our Westy
and it's a breeze to empty without a mess.  It has a drain spout that
swivels to any angle to make things easier.  By itself that's a definite
improvement but still can be a bit messy.

I liberated a 2 foot piece of Gates marine hose that slips over the tapered
spout and fits/seals tightly.  Placing the end of this extension right in a
toilet bowl outlet, then thumbing open the air valve results in a totally
mess free dump and flush.  Using the same extension to dump into a privy has
the same result, partly because you can stand to one side at a respectful
distance :-)

I carry an old plastic pitcher for dumping water into the potty's waste tank
after emptying.  A few quick sloshes and dump.  Repeat, and then remove the
extension hose and store it in the pitcher.  Everything's clean and smelling
sweet and you're back in business.  With practice and reasonable access to
water the whole drill takes less than 10 minutes.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Best way is just to take it with you when you visit a regular toilet.
Dumping the whole thing down the loo and then flushing takes exactly as much
water as when you simply do your business.  Be sure to clean up any
splashes, so as to be a good citizen!  &lt;&lt;
