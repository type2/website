&gt;     Hey the same thing happens to me in my bus!! And I even have the OEM
&gt; clock in the dash.  Sometimes I find myself tooling down the road 
&gt; turning
&gt; down the cd player so I can listen to the motor, birds chirp, or the 
&gt; wind.
&gt; Busses rule for this reason.

man, that's it.  The whole &quot;turning down the radio&quot;....going down the 
road, feelin' good.
Every time I reach for my watch (my cell phone) I put it back before 
looking at it and
just pay more attention to the sounds she's making and the beautiful 
weather  -- as
all weather is!  :)
