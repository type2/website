&gt; Well, you guys never cease to surprise me.  I saw a post of Karl's about
&gt; torquing lug nuts.  At the time I just chuckled knowing that Karl is
&gt; somewhat of a perfectionist.  I've never in my life heard of anybody
&gt; torquing lug nuts.  I always just got them tight with a lug wrench and
&gt; didn't worry about it.  Is this something VW specific or have I been
&gt; risking mine and somebody else's lives all these years in the many
&gt; vehicles I've owned having lost only one lug nut that I can remember?
&gt; Learn something new here every day.  Thanks....KR

where I get my tires (NTB) always torques all tires on all cars to spec, I
had to show them the spec for my bus in Bentley because they didn't have
the numbers in their computer.  they have special wrenches they use to
tighten all lug nuts.

I suspect this is legal protection issue
