Hey now:

'79 stock fuel injected bus.  I'm trying to determine the size of the fuel
line that goes in between the fuel filter and the fuel pump.  This is not
the standard 7mm line, but rather a fatter hose with wider diameter.  This
is on the low pressure side of the fuel pump.

Going to the dealer first thing in the morning and I'm on digest at home so
please pmail answers to my home email address, timatt_at_fwi_dot_com.

Thanks
Tim Woenker
