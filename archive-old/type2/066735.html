&gt; &gt;This weekend I am planning on installing a new starter in the Westy.
&gt; &gt;Are there any hints, tips, suggestions ya'll have before I tackle the
&gt; &gt;job?

&gt; Don't drop it on your face. BTDT.

Y'know, if I hadn't done the same thing, I wouldn't be ROTFL!

Serious hints:

DISCONNECT THE GROUND STRAP!!!!!

Bring a twisty under there with you.  The push-on connectors
are easy to keep track of, but it is easy to lose one or more of the wires
under the stud.  If you thread a twisty throught them as you take them
off, they are easy to find later.  

To reconnect the upper bolt, you will need a fine flat-blade screwdriver. 
Push the &quot;D&quot;-head bolt through and get up into the engine compartement. 
Put that screwdriver into the thread next to the case so you don't
accidentally push the bolt back into the netherworld as you try to start
the nut.
