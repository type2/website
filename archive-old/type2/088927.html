Subject: Overheating solution

I just thought I would share a couple things I learned this week when my =
bus was overheating.  It was getting so hot I couldn't touch the carb or =
the fan housing while the engine was running.

I don't know the word to describe what happened to my oil cooler seal, =
but I know someone else will.  One of them had a reduced inside =
diameter.  Reducing the oil passing through the oil cooler. I didn't =
realize they could go bad that way. I just  thought they could  start =
leaking.

Other thing I learned was about the piston for the oil relief valve.  =
The one in a type 3 engine is different. It is slotted. It will allow =
the oil cooler to cool more oil.  Or make it pass through more often.   =
I'm not exactly sure, but is suppose to lower you oil temps about 15 =
degrees.  We tried it in my mechanics bug.  He says he can see the =
difference.  I am going to try it in my bus next. =20

I haven't seen anyone talk about these things.  I'm sure others could =
give more detail.  Just my two cents!
