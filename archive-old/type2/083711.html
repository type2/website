&gt; &gt;It is true that you don't want to exceed 30-32 on a wedge chamber (no semi

&gt; &gt;10-15 degrees of timing (unless you like losing 4mpg and a hotter running
&gt; &gt;engine). If you understand how vacuum advance works, it disappears at 1/2
&gt; &gt;throttle, leaving you with the hose-disconnected timing (Wow, 30-32 degrees,
&gt; &gt;remember?).

&gt; What John says seems consistent w/ what I've been thinking, so I'll
toss this out to see if I'm wrong.  I think that on TI and T4 engines
(w/o semi hemi heads), the desirable max advance at plus 1/2 throttle
under full load is the same: 30-32 deg BTDC.  The challenge is that if
you put a timing light on a motor w/ a combined mechanical/vacuum advance
distributor (i.e. the stock distributor for a 1600dp and the SVDA) and,
w/ no load on the motor, pull the throttle open by hand until timing
maxes out, the throttle never exceeds appx. 1/4 open.  At 1/4 throttle,
the vacuum advance mechanism will be in play, thus the timing will be:
&gt; 	initial setting (e.g. 7.5deg BTDC) plus
&gt; 	Mechanical advance (e.g. 22 deg) plus
&gt; 	vacuum advance (e.g. 10 deg) equals
&gt; 	max advance reading (e.g. 39.5 degrees BTDC)
&gt; This is different from max advance at plus 1/2 throttle which will be:
&gt; 	initial setting (e.g. 7.5deg BTDC) plus
&gt; 	Mechanical advance (e.g. 22 deg) plus
&gt; 	vacuum advance--0 deg. equals
&gt; 	max advance reading (e.g. 29.5 degrees BTDC)
&gt; This is confusing to those seeking to set max advance while the bus is
in driveway (i.e. me).  In theory you could estimate max advance at plus
1/2 throttle by subtracting the amount of advance provided by the vacuum
advance mechanism.  In practice, the exact amount of advance provided by
the vacuum advance mechanism at 1/4 throttle, no-load can't be determined
very precisely.
[...]

What we call &quot;vacuum advance&quot; distributors are't really advancing with
vacuum, at least not manifold vacuum.  The vacuum signal to the
distributor comes from the carburator and is controlled by the throttle
opening and airflow through the carburator.

You're right in that it is hard to get good readings in the unloaded
condition.  You can run the engine at a speed where all the centrifugal
advance is in and then blip the throttle open while watching the timing
marks.  The vacuum advance comes into play and you can pick out the
maximum.  It helps to have the marks highlighted with white paint (&quot;Liquid
paper&quot; works well).
