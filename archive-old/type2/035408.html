Subject: Need search help please

I have found the instructions for doing a search of the archives a little
confusing. I don't know much about search criteria and was wondering if
someone could help me out a little. Please assume I am younger than 9 or
older than 40. 

I would like to do searches for multiple word criteria such as &quot;disk
brakes&quot; or &quot;oil cooler&quot;. How would I present such criteria to the search
engine so that I only get pages that contain the words as written and not
everything containing &quot;oil&quot; and &quot;cooler&quot;?

Any other search tips, tricks are welcome.

Thanks
John
