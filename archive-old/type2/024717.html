 Are you sure that you checked your pushrod length? and extension.  If
 it's wrong you can screw up the pump or simply have it not work. 
 Check the Bentley manual for the correct specs for your pump.
 
 I've found that mechanical pumps are far less prone to failure than
 the electric pumps I've tried.
