I stand corrected. Thanks David. So indeed 75's still had the 1800. Either way, my main foe to making the progressive work with the 009 was attempting to time the 009 on the pancake incorrectly. I finally saw a post which stated that an 009 likes about 5-7 before tdc at idle when using an 009. Before that I was thinking 28 btdc at idle (yikes!) that wasn't working out. 5-7 degrees btdc seems to get me in the ballpark, but my idle is still a few hundred rpms too high for my neck, so I continue to seal possible vacuum leaks, spin the adjustment screws on the holley, and remain teachable.....
