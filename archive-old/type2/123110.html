&gt; &gt; Second question is I had a problem recently with the fuel breather

&gt; &gt; vented gas cap wrong am I missing something? Do others use vented gas
&gt; &gt; caps too?
&gt; 
&gt; So long as vapors can escape and replacement air can enter there is no
&gt; harm in this.  It is not what was originally intended but it will not
&gt; cause any problems.

if it is just for testing, you could just simply loosen the gas cap to see
if this solves your problem, if it does than a vented cap could help, if
not then you are wasting your money, also if you are in an area where
there is EPA testing many times (I know here in MD) a vented cap will not
pass the test.
