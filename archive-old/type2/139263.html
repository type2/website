Subject: Re: [T2] parcel trays revisited

Dave, et al-

Santa Claus did, in fact, bring me the parcel trays I'd asked for.

It appears that Ron has since updated his website to disclaim that 
these will not fit what he calls a &quot;Deluxe&quot; bus... one that has the 
armrest fresh air ducts (I had mistakenly referred to them as heater 
ducts on this forum &amp; he posted that language on his site).

I held a tray into place to see what might work.  It appears that I'd 
need to scrap my armrests (which is a possibility, as my interior 
panels haven't been restored yet), AND find a different metal duct 
piece (the one you usually see those cool electric fans mounted in) 
that doesn't flare out to feed the armrest ducts.

If anyone is interested in buying mine, I'll hear your offer.  
Otherwise, I'll probably send it back.

Could 2005 be the year?
