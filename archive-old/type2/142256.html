Subject: RE: [T2] More KONI's Now Available!

So the original equipment ones from Germany are not as good? How much better
are the Koni shocks?

&gt;Cheap at that price,,,,...you get what you pay for

$100 for a shock is cheap? Wow, I don't think I have ever paid that much for
shocks for any vehicle. I guess it is one of those things that you don't know
until you try them. I would love to, but not at that price and it looks like
this is the last chance to get a set.
