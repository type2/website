I dunno.  I have found, however that dwell is fairly critical to good
runnng, and the closer I am to 50 degrees the better my bus runs.  Also, I
tend these days to run it up and down the RMP range a bit to see if dwell
varies with RPM.  On older, worn Distributors, it can vary quite
substantially, which is bad.  Only cure I know for that is a rebuilt
distributor or replace the Voltage Regulator (VR) depending on which is
bad (see below).

&gt; I have a second question, too, from reading over a couple of threads on
&gt; the [sometimes imperfect] relation of dwell angle and point gap.  There
&gt; was some mention of having to fiddle with one number to get the other one
&gt; right--accepting a non-spec dwell angle if the points are by-god gapped
&gt; right, or going to a non-spec point gap to get the &quot;right&quot; dwell angle.  
&gt; If, as some listees said was the case, their rig just will not produce the
&gt; right dwell angle at the right gap, which measurement should they rely on?

Well, it's like this...  both measurements are proxies for the actual
dwell angle, and the possibility exists that you will get it wrong using
either method. What you really want is for the points to be open for a
certain part of the crankshaft rotation to allow the coil to build up
voltage for the next spark.  The ideal, IMHO, is 50 degrees +/-0, which
is not that hard to achieve (tho the one GM idea I wish VW had bought
into is that allen-wrench adjustable points plate).  

With the points gap method, you assume that the lobe height is constant
and stock.  If the cam is worn, then you will get too much dwell because
the cam is not lifting the points as high as it ought or for as long as it
ought.

With the dwell meter, you are assume voltage is constant and measure the
percent of 12V that the points pass, averaged over time.  If your VR is
mis-set or not rock-solid, then the dwell will be wrong.

I tend to go with the dwell meter method, but acknowledge its potential
weakness.

On a side note, if you are caught without a dwell meter and want to set 
your dwell that way, you can use a volt meter (preferably an analogue
one).  The dwell formula for our 4-cylinder engines is as follows:

There are 360 degrees in a circle. the points must open and close once for
each cylinder during each rotation of the rotor.

Which means once each 90 degrees of rotation

To allow the coil time to build energy for the spark, you want the points
to be *open* (I think) for 50 of those 90 degrees.

If the VR is putting out 12V then the ratio is:

50     x
--- = ---  or 6.6V
90    12

Now in actuallity, the VR is set a tad higher than 12V, so closer to 7 is
ideal.
