Subject: Re: [T2] First Bus / Rebuild or Buy Longblock ?

Roger said:


 The previous owner let his 17yr old son drive the bus while the son's car was in the shop!  The #3 exhaust
valve broke off hit the piston turned sideways and jammed its way into the head.  I am looking at new heads
$400, gaskets/bearings $100, cylinder &amp; pistons $300, $300 cam, machine work etc.   I am new to this world of
air-cooled, rebuilt a lot of Jeeps and GM.  It seems to me that from a cost standpoint, due to the damage,
that a long block is pretty close to the cost of me buying the parts and having the machine work done and
putting it together myself. Not to mention buying a long block for $1600 incl. shipping gives me the
chance to upgrade to the 2000.

 Am I correct in this dilemma?  Anyone else run the numbers and come up with this?  Am I missing something?

Due to my recent entry into this world, I would like to buy the long block through Bus Depot it seems that
they are very reputable and would have chosen wisely when picking a supplier.

You neglected the core charge figure in your equation.

With the damage done to the head, you will not get a full core credit.....
