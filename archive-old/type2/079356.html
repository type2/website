-------------------------------------------
But wouldn't the tire and wheel also serve to spread
the impact over a greater area and therefore provide a
greater amount of structure to absorb said impact? I
thought that would be a good thing.
Dave     PS: I didn't take physics.
------------------------------------------
Dave, Physics is fairly intuitive. That being
said, the laws of physics are fairly rigid in that
you have a fixed set of variables to work with.
IF physics could actually give you the answer to this
question then all of the test labs run by (almost) all
of the manufacturers of vehicles of all types could
be mothballed. In fact, reality sometimes suprises
even the most experienced theorticians.
  In surfer Bob's example the only way to tell if the
tire made things worse would be for him to run into
another cow under similar conditions... without the
tire on the front of the bus... I will buy the beer
afterwards Bob...
  In short, we do not know the answer to this question
without doing a series of controlled tests.
