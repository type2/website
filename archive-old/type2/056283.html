hi chaps (and ladies of course), 
i pulled the motor on my 72 westy today for a little oil seal work and maybe
bearing replacement to find, whats this, i have the wrong motor. it should
have been a 72 'cb' 1700. instead it turns out to be a 76 and on ge (2000)
motor. no wonder it ran so well. some po had put all the original tin back on
and i got the engine number from that. then i noticed the different number
stamped in the case.  question- i looked in my clymer book and it says there
is only 4 more horses from the 2000 than the 1700. does that 300 cc make that
much difference? what about mpg?
well the moral of the story is, check and double check. who knows what other
people have done.
cheers, marty :)
