Subject: spring loaded pushtubes for 67 westy?

Hi all,

 It appears that I have a couple of push tubes leaking, and it is =
getting worse, where can I find the spring loaded type? If I use this =
type, can they be installed without removing or loosening the heads?

BTW it is a stock 1500...

Thanks,,,
