&lt;&lt; I posted on my 80 Westfalia apparently overheating before and now that I 
have 
 an oil temperature gauge, I know it. Down the highway/freeway it indicates 
 220 + in our 100 degree ambient temperatures. &gt;&gt;

Probably normal, vanagons weighed alot more then kombi's. As for what wrong, 
my 72 stays cool at idle, all your tinware there? Did you check your timeing? 
lets see what else, pinging?? i know that causes extra heat....  gunk cloging 
your oil cooler, when i pulled my engine about a forth of my cooler was 
covered in gunk.... uhh,
