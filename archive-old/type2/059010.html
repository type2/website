 I have a '71 westy. No motor. Pretty banged up but roadworthy with a 
little effort. Body is mostly straight. Rusty in spots but from a 
distance looks ok. Camper kit is mostly complete. Some vinyl rips and 
the spice rack is pretty thrashed. Kit is just sitting in there not 
bolted down as I was in the process of  redoing the floor. The wood 
floor that is. Canvas has some rips but can be repaired. All wheels are 
there and it can be towed without hassle. I also threw in a bunch of 
engine parts. Crank, freshly turned flywheel, a bunch of engine tin, 
dist. a couple carbs, manifolds, generators, heads etc..
 I am moving and want $325 and you tow away the whole lot. Don't want to 
part it out. I have a signed title for it.
 I live in Corvallis Ore.
