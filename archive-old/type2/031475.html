&gt; Has anyone ever bought a BN4 heater from Cassandra at Coyfishat_at_aol_dot_com?
&gt; They are selling heaters for $100, just need to know if anyone has had any
&gt; experiences with this person?

be sure it is a BN4, BA4 is much more avaliable and is much harder to fit
into a bus, ask me how I know ?
