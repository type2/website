Subject: Tennessee workings

Seems everyone is posting lately recent progress on our buses in a 
mechanical sence. This is good as I hope to see many people driving 
their buses to campouts this spring. I thought I might join in as well.

For months I have been feeding oil into the leaking monster. It would 
loose at least a few ounces every startup, on the case right below where 
the oil cooler is located. My assumption was that I had a loose nut or 
bad seal at the cooler, but until I could pull the engine it just had to 
sit and leak. The only good thing was after it warmed up, the leak was 
nearly stopped. sooooooo. Over the new years holiday I pulled the engine.

Nothing new here, just normal removal. I pulled the tin and retorqued 
the case and heads. I was amazed how all the bolts needed some sort of 
tweek. Pulled the oil cooler and found the problems. One was a slightly 
loose nut holding the cooler mount to the case, the other was some very, 
very hard sealing seals. With those replaced I moved on to fiddling with 
my carbs and replacing the intake and exhaust seals. My #1/2 head intake 
gasket had managed to come apart and cause a vacuum leak. I replaced the 
crappy ones with the metal one and moved along.

I run the dual solex setup and have been happy except for the repeaded 
problems with the chokes. The assembly has become fairly sloppy and some 
parts have broken. One in particular is a small lever that the electric 
choke pushes against to actually operate the choke. Once again it fell 
off the choke shaft, but fixed it good this time ;) A welder is a 
fantastic thing! Just be careful welding on anything that once contained 
gasoline.

With that fixed I just took my time painting a bit of tin and then 
assembling the accessories back to their proper places. The bumper/frame 
I had fabricated for my single wheel had a design problem with where my 
remote oil filter is located. I had to disconnect the filter from the 
engine to remove the bumper. Having enought of this PITA I relocated the 
filter to the inboard side of the frame rail and modified my oil line 
routing. problem fixed.


I can say the engine runs much better now and doesn't leak a drop. It's 
all ready for camping season 2006. One project I have not finished yet 
is hooking a real air filter back up. I hate the filters that came with 
the solexs. I want to pipe up my original oil bath filter to the duals, 
but in it's stock location it interferes with the passenger side carb. I 
have made a custom bracket for it, to move it rearward a few inches to 
get the clearance. I still have to decide what I can use to create the 
air plenum to the carbs. I suspect I can use a few different pieces of 
radiator hoses, but have not yet tackled that. There is always next week!
