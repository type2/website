Subject: Re: [T2] Pics of the dangers of a front mounted spare

hey - im not disagreeing that they are unsafe - IIRC - you said:

    &quot;What in the hell do you guys think would happen with a direct blast
    without the spare tire mount?

    Whatever you hit would be in your lap---
    Or the nose sheet metal &amp; dash board  would most certainly be anyway.&quot;

Which to me sounds like you're saying that without the spare tire mount 
whatever I hit would be in my lap - I'm saying - in the accident I was in - 
I believe you are wrong. I am not disagreeing that a bus is a relatively 
unsafe vehicle as compared to most other vehicles - I'm just arguing that a 
spare tire mount in the front - in my case - caused way way more damage to 
the car (my bus) and did nothing to prevent injury to myself or my 
passenger. I'm saying - in my opinion - at the speed of my impact - the 
bumper was the ticket - the spare only served to damage my bus. I'm not 
disagreeing that there are speeds at which a front mounted spare tire would 
save you. I am also not disagreeing that there are speeds at which a front 
mounted spare tire won't make any difference at all.
