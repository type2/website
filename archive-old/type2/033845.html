you wrote:
&gt;&gt;The pushrod for the alternator style fuel pump is longer than the generator
style. That may be why your fuel pump is damaged.&lt;&lt;

Er?...Am i missin sumpin ere?  Why would a fuel pump be different for an
alternator than a generator.  Would the Mexican case be cast differently
for the alternator requiring a different length fuel pump pushrod??

Just curious.
