Subject: immaculate 21 window schoolbus toy

I was going round a boot sale in the east end of london this Am and bouht a
great find.( A boot sale is the English equivalent of a flea_market)

It is a Japanese tin toy, 21 window schoolbus. I may not fit the
prefectionist ideas of ThomF and Claraw but it is unused in th cardbox. You
pyush it forward and it make a siren noise.

It looks like it came from the 50's but the oddity is that there is a
bar_code on the side of the box. All the passenger are occidentals and the
male driver is on the right hand side with an adult female front seat
passeger, there are about 12 kids faces in the back, with the little skylite
windows. The writing on the side of the bus is Japanese!!!  No Jail BArs or
rear quarter windows.

What is it?? and does it have any monetary value or is it just neat splittie
memorabilia???
