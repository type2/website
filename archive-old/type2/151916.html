&gt; &gt; Hey all---spent all day on Erin's bus, still no success.
&gt; The ongoing saga---
&gt;
&gt; So we were once again unable to get the bus running.  In some ways
&gt; things have gone to worse, we're not able to get the bus to turn over
&gt; now since Erin pulled the distributor to get the part number.  I'm down
&gt; the block from a VW mechanic's shop, and he's come by a couple times to
&gt; help us out, but by Friday afternoon he had to acknowledge that he's
&gt; stumped.  The bus will fire on the cold start injector, but stops stops
&gt; immediately afterwards, and we just don't know why.  I gave him a bottle
&gt; of wine for his troubles.  :)

this is a classic fuel pump not running problem,  the double relay allows
the pump to run when starting but as soon as the key is released (when the
engine starts) the other side of the double relay should keep the pump
running..  check the AFM connection and push the air flap to see if the
pump runs. check the double relay.

good luck

Bob
