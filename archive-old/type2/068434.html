Subject: Re: Wanted: Gas heater for '70 Bus

&gt;&gt;Since my last posting was a bust, I'll try again.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I need a used gas heater in good condition for my friend's '70.  If you
&gt;&gt;have something that might work, drop me a line.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks.
&gt;&gt;
I've got a heater, but not all the ductwork/exhaust etc.  Will this help?
