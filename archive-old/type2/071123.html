&gt; I would like to pull the engine in my 80 Westy.  The archive instructions 
&gt;  specify putting the transmission in neutral to disengage the cv joints, 
but 
&gt;  my problem is that the trans is stuck in 4th gear (why I want to pull the 
&gt;  engine in the first place).  Is it really necessary to have the trans in 
&gt;  neutral?  If so, maybe just removing the nosecone would be a better way to 
&gt;  go?  Thanks.

With the transmission in neutral you can jack the wheel up and use the wheel 
to turn the drive shaft to facilite easier access to the CV joint bolts, but 
I've never found it necessary to do that on a loaf.

If there is reduced access on a vanagon requiring that the shaft must be 
turned to give access to the wheels then get an assistant to press the clutch 
pedal so that the transmission is not connected to the engine and then turn 
the wheel to turn the drive shaft.

My '73 got stuck in 3rd (no grinding or expensive noises just permanently in 
3rd) and the problem was inside the nosecone. On the end inner end of the 
shift rod there is a J shaped hook the curve goes through a rubber bushing 
(which looks like a 7mm (approx) diameter sphere  with a hole through it). 
the rubber bushing sits in an eye on the top of a vertical rod.
As the gear shift moves the rod back and forwards and rotates it the movement 
is translated to the vertical bar which then moves the selector rails.
The problem was that the  'hook' had come out of the worn bushing and 
everything got locked in third gear. When the mechanism inside of the nose 
cone was put back together with a new bushing (£0.50 UK = $1.00 USA) 
everything worked OK.
I hope its as simple for you. Before disassembly of the nose cone we were 
expecting to find the parts which hold the vertical rod in place and allow it 
to turn had broken as (apparently this was common prior to a minor redesign 
of the selector mechanism for 1974 model year)

Any way although you have an '80 model year I hope that you find something 
just as simple wrong with your transmission as I did and do check if the 
problem is within the nosecone before tearing the rest of the box apart.

Good luck
