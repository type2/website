&gt; You can build your own for cheap. Use a O2 sensor (3 wire is best) and do a

The cheap ones are narrowband sensors, like OEM manufacturers put into
cars.  They don't work well on the rich mixtures that performance and
aircooled people are interested in.  Wideband sensors are another animal,
and cost a lot more.

You can tune with a narrowband sensor, but the problem is that the ratios
that aircooled engines need are at the edge of the narrowband's envelope.
It will tell you if you are too lean, but not if you are too rich.

I've been doing a lot of research on this field lately while considering
summer projects.  :)
