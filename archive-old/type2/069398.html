Subject: Electrical fire follow-up

Thanks to everyone who responded to our message re: the
electrical fire we had the other day.  The consensus
seems to be (as we had suspected) that a short took place
somewhere in the positive battery cable.  One possible
scenario is that the cable shorted out to metal near
where the rubber and metal brake lines meet, thereby
heating up the brake line(s) and causing the rubber
line to seperate from the metal connector at its end
(no metal part of the brake line was free to move, so it
couldn't have moved to cause the short).

The brake fluid may then have started the fire, or at least
fueled it further.  We'll never know for sure, as the damage
that took place likely conceals the original cause.  The positive
cable has 12-16 inches of insulation which burned/melted off, so
we'd be hard pressed to find where the original fault was.

To follow-up on some issues raised by some of those who
responded:

- - In terms of how an 8 volt battery is charged.  We just
followed the advice of others on the list and tried to
use a charger for 6 and 12 volt batteries, on the 6 volt 
setting.  I have been told this should work by a battery
distributor as well.  We did have to try the manual setting.  
The old battery didn't seem to take a charge on this setting 
or on the 12 volt setting (which we tried only after the 6 volt 
didn't work).  Thus we bought and installed a new 8 volt battery.

- - We're not sure that just the use of the 8 volt battery could 
have caused the problem, as has been suggested inone response.  
There was one in there before we put the new one in, and the cables 
(without knowing the exact gauge) seem just as large as those used 
in any 12 volt system.  They are also quite new (though installed by 
the previous owner).  We have not yet been able to check the output 
of the voltage regulator when charging.  If the previous owner did not 
get it set to put out more voltage - could this really result in the 
amount of heat being generated to lead to this result (i.e. fire)?  


If that wouldn't make it produce such heat - the best guess seems
to be that the positive cable, despite being quite new, developed
a hole in the insulation and the exposed wire came into contact
with metal (near the brake line connection it seems).  The contact 
might have been the result of the  cable having been moved when the old 
battery was removed and the new one installed.  The previous owner may 
not have have had the cable routed and attached properly (he had the fuel 
line, with no clamps anywhere, not even attached to the mounts designed 
to keep it away from moving parts), and this may have resulted in 
premature wear to some section of the cable. Or slight heat build up (see 
above) could have resulted in a break in the insulation. We'll never 
know for sure.

We are hoping to hook everything back up next weekend and would 
appreciate advice as to how best be sure we won't develop the same 
problem again.  We'll be using new cables for the positive side
and negative side of the battery.  We'll attach things at the starter
to avoid any improper contact and attach the cables so as to prevent
wear.  Once we've done all that - what is the best way to be sure
the system is set up properly and won't generate too much heat?  Just
run it for awhile and check for heat build up?  If heat does seem
to develop - what should we check/fix next?  Should we consider that
we really do need to use a 6 volt battery?  

Thanks in advance.

Brian and Stephanie
