&gt;David,

&gt;the interesting thing is that without the spring (I believe is the one
&gt;between the distributor shaft and case, if my english is right) the
&gt;upward movement is still there.

If I remember correctly, the one I am thinking of sits in the top of the
distributor drive shaft.  It's small, maybe 40mm wide by 3cm long.  I think
I made a mistake in my last post - I said that the distributor body lifts
up 3mm - I meant 30mm.
