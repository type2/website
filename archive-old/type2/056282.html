Subject: I'm Finally the Owner of a Bus!
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

       Ya! Hi Fellow listees. I have a new member in my Volks family. A 1973
Westy.
The PO delivered it as planned, and we (My Father and I) drove them Home.
(About 90 miles
Kitchener Ontario.
       I should intro duce myself .........Phil Gowdy, damm glad to meet
you.
I haven't had a chance to look at the motor but it sounds like its missing
when running although power seems pretty good for a loaded bus with an old
1700.
        No idea about the mileage maybe 130,000. miles.
The body is good and the interior is original with added  stove ,which I'm
removing.
       I'm sure I'll have many questions and hopefully some answers in the
near future.
I'm doing a tune -up ala Hoover tomorrow.
       Question: On the top of the motor,aft of the intake filter box is a
copper looking pipe that someone has cut off and soldered or brazed.
       What is this?



            Thanks for any replies.
Peace Phil
73 Westy.......&quot;The Contraption&quot;
67 Beetle........ Old Blue
