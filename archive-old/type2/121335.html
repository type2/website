&gt;My 78 Westy has front door locks that are VERY difficult to turn with the

&gt;Does anyone have suggestions on what could be done externally to make these

&gt;the linkage, what is the best proceedure and do I need any special tools.
&gt;All other locks open easily.

No way to clean and lube inside without going inside. Also, you must remove 
the latch mechanism to do a good job of cleaning and lubing. No special 
tools are required, just some tenacity. My 72 had the same issues when I 
got it. Removed, cleaned and lubed everything and they now work perfectly 
again. Still all original lock cylinders at 30 years old.
