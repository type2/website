Subject: color wiring diagrams

I've had a few requests so I will make this offer to the whole
list.  My Bentley has color wiring diagrams for 68 through 72
busses.  It was old and falling apart so I removed the diagrams
and had them laminated.  I found out that I could make a color
photo copy of them and it comes out great.  So I will send
anybody a color copy of the diagram for what it costs me.  $2.72
for each year.  $6.72 if you want them laminated.  Please send me
an e-mail off the list if you are interested.
Hope this helps some people,
