Subject: re: slider roof seals

&gt; All of the above is true except.... the felt is

&gt; space and prevent the wind from forcing the water over
&gt; the lip an into the bus. they designed it to allow the
&gt; water to enter and the just drain.

This sounds pretty similar to the construction of sunroofs on bugs, 
though the bug version may have only two drains. A few years back, I 
had a lovely little pale blue '65 bug with a sunroof. It had quite a few 
floor leak problems, so I was used to driving with wet feet, but one day 
the heavens opened up. Being totally clueless (about almost any 
mechanical matters... I read this list for things to discuss with our 
mechanic and to sorta know a lot of cool folks), I managed to 
persuade a friend who had a bus to look at it. He figured out that those 
tubes were clogged... clearing them involved the rather nasty process 
of putting suction on the downside/road end. But once they were clear 
again, the bug went back to being perfectly sealed (from the top 
anyway) with no further maintenance on the seal. This may not apply 
to the bus roof, but I thought it worth saying... if your roof is leaking, 
make sure you clear the tubes.
