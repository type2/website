    That switch is no good. I had one go bad and started doing that
exact same thing. Mine would work on high beam or low, but if you had it
on high, as soon as you used the turn signal, the headlights would go
out. If you kept it on low, you could use the turn signals. And
sometimes there just wasn't any high beam no matter what. Junk it. I
bought a new switch from RMMW and it's been fine from then on. 
    My wife had the unfortunate experience of having a cop see the
headlights go out with the old switch. He pulled her over, gave her a
real hassle, tried to tell her she couldn't drive the car home (I mean,
she did have low beams anyway) -- guy was a real jerk, wish it had been
me, I'd have told him to stick it up his ass and drove away, all he can
do under WI law is give you a five day warning notice in the first
place.
