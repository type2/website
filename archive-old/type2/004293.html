I don't think I have ever seen one of these in the South (Louisiana), But I
sure like the idea of them better then the Westy, especially the older
versions with the upper cot instead of the bed.

Any reconditioned ones out there for sale?

BTW  I saw and drove an 81 Vanogan for sale Drove good, pock mark rust on
front, a bit ugly but seemed sound. Asked $1950.00  called back and said
would take $1500.00

Any interest?


Rick
