&gt; &gt; I'm looking for the 17mm hex plug socket, for the

Here's waht I use:  I took a short bolt with a 17 mm
head, screwed a 17 mm bolt onto it and welded it in
place on the end, so basically what you have is a
little thing that looks like a &quot;dumbell&quot;, 17 mm on
both ends. One end goes into the plug on your tranny,
the other you can just use your regular 17mm socket on
to tight or loosen, works beautifully.
BTW, have I mentioned that I am a cheap S.O.B.??!!
