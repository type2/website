Subject: Oktoberbus!

Allrighty then!
It's October, and do you know what that means, kiddies?  That's right, 
Oktoberbus is just 12 days away!  The weekend of 11-13 October is that 
special time where buses from all over the place converge upon Van Hoy Family 
Campground in Union Grove, NC for a weekend of bus related stuff.  

Traditionally one of the smaller campouts, Oktoberbus is a great opportunity 
to wind down the camping seaason, meet old and new friends one last time 
{Moonies know differently though ;^) } and generally enjoy a great fall 
weekend.

This year we would like to celebrate our personal favorite holiday, 
Hallowe'en!  Bring decorations for your bus/site/group camp.  Bring goodies 
for trick or treating for young and old.  Dress up in costume if you dare.

The Full Moon Bus Club will be serving up tasty Breakfast Burritos Saturday 
Morning, bring food donations and your own eating utensils.  The regulars 
know what to do, let's do it folks.

How much will this cost? you might ask.  Negotiations with the campground 
were long, confusing, and arduous, and were settled on $5 per adult per 
night, $2 for kids 16 and under.  No charge for our 4 legged friends, and you 
can even bring your dog.
