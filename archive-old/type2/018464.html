           I'd have to wonder about putting a muffler not specifically
designed for the VW engine on there. Even the stock VW muffler isn't
optimal for power, that's why I always use an extractor. Also, it would
be interesting  to see how Midas dealt with all the varieties of VW
exhaust over various years, Calif. or Fed, carb or FI (w/ or without O2
sensors), catalytic convertors, etc. for those who wanted to pass
emissions tests.
           But you're right, it might be a cheap alternative -- OTOH, a
new muffler once and awhile isn't going to break me. I just opted for a
$135 S&amp;S extractor. I'm going to give it a coat of good hi-temp paint
and then wrap it with that insulating tape made for exhausts.
