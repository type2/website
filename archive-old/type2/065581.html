Subject: what is it...??

I have a question one of the more knowledgable of you might help
with... just found a cache of Splitties in a salvage yard here in NH

        the one I'm interested is a hardtop camper can't find any ID plates, so
heres a description: Hardtop with submarine hatch, non-walk-thru, two
bench seats facing each other (can't get into the side doors; do these
fold down somehow to make bunks), swing-up table with funky
leg/attachment to drivers' side wall, cabinet on passenger side rear;
large oval shaped door on front, curved corner, two smaller oval shaped
rear deck-ceiling doors on rear, wrought iron rack thing behind rear
bench seat ( from cabinet to opposite wall) curtain rods on sides same
as '67 westy I had ( with s-curve for overlap) curtain rod side to side
at front partion( 1&quot; curtain rings) mounted just under fan outlet

        I'm pretty sure I'm going to try and save this bus... at least for the
interior... Bus has been sitting frame deep in rotten apples for 18-20
years (right next to a 23 window Deluxe sunroof with NO floors or
frame)so I don't think it can be restored also it has a broken front
drivers' side windshield so dash is in Very rough shape...

        Yard owner said $100 for the whole thing including the partially
disassembled 36hp motor sitting in the back...

                        any help determining what year this is would be appreciated

                        JonR
