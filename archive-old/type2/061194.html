&gt; Do not respond to me call Tim at 1-703-534-2906,near Falls Church VA. 
&gt; Tell Tim that John from Phila. sent you.
&gt; Will someone please forward this to the vintage bus list.


If anybody wants me to go take a look at this bus, it is only a couple
of blocks from me. I think I have seen it before, but only from
a moving vehicle.
