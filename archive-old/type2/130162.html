Subject: Overheating? How can you tell?

HI All,
  I found myself pondering this question recently. If you have stock
instrumentation, I, ie oil pressure light, how do you tell if you are
overheating your VW engine? And I mean, 'hopefully', before damage is
done. As a relative VW 'newbie', I am curious. I am looking at a bus,
and I will have to drive at least 500 miles getting it home, so I want
to make sure that I do not break anything.

Thanks All,
Matt
