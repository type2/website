If you can get the Liestritz system from Bus Depot:

http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=211251053EC

You will find that it bolts up very nicely.  It seems to have a longer
service life than the cheaper options.

I notice that Ron has appended a /Ernst to the Liestritz in the ad.  You
might check ahead to see what manufacturer he is actually stocking or if
the manufacturers have merged.

Avoid Mexican or Brazilian mufflers.  The money you save won't be worth
the extreme hassle of making the parts fit.
