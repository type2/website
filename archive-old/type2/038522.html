Subject: Re: LEDs in the dash (was '69 electrical FIXED!!)

There are white LEDs. They are a very recent invention thats why Rat Shack
doesnt have them yet. Im sure an internet search or maybe a Big
electronics house can turn some up. and they are plenty bright like those
blue LEDs which BTW are a pretty recent invention as well. White LEDs may
not be all that cheap yet but they wont burn out in this lifetime MTBF is
prob like in the 100,000 hour range.
