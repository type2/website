Subject: Virginia Emission Inspection - fixed!!
Date: Wed, 26 Jul 2000 16:41:17 GMT
Mime-Version: 1.0

Can I have an opinion on the following URL??

It seems that vehicles 25 years or OLDER, do not need to undergo an 
emissions inspection.

Effective 1 July 2000

Now, isn't THAT a kick in the butt!!
