Subject: Re: Rocker Geometry Questions

I got screwed by SCAT  buying those things.

I blueprint my engines, and to get the lift available from the cam I had
to add 3/8&quot; under the RA mounts. Needless to say, this carp holds an
honored place on my work bench. Every time I look at them, I remember
that the money I wasted was the last dollar from me SCAT will EVER see!
I called SCAT -- they where like christmas lights on a bulldozer --
useless.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in the process of re-assembling the 1500 from my wife's Type1 and I ran
&gt; into a head scratcher: I decided when ordering parts that the swivel-foot
&gt; rocker adjusting screws would be a good move. The set I got said all that
&gt; was required to do to compensate for the increased length of the screws was
&gt; to shim under the pedestals. In the kit were four shims (washers) measuring
&gt; .075&quot; each. That wasn't enough. If I shim a total of .175&quot;, there seems to
&gt; be enough clearance/adjustment range. My concern is the rocker geometry.
&gt; Who out there has BTDT? Would removing material from the underside of the
&gt; rocker arms be better? I looked at shortening the pushrods, but that
&gt; appeared that it would make angles worse. Any advice/opinions appreciated.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
