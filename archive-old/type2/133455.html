&gt; &gt; actually I think VW had a correction and stated not to use the serrated
&gt; &gt; lock washers at all. I have discarded mine years ago and have had no
&gt; &gt; problems just using the funny two holed washers that connect two bolts
&gt; &gt; together....
&gt;
&gt; Do you have a service bulletin number for this?  While Volkswagen deleted
&gt; the dished washer between the CV hub and the half-shaft, I have never seen
&gt; a service bulletin deleting the serrated washers.  In addition, Volkswagen
&gt; still sells these washers today.

whoops think you are right, was thinking the dished washers.  the lock
washers are still used I do believe....now you got me wondering??????
