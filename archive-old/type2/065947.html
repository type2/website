Subject: ('62) Scored Another Brochure!!!

At the moment I'm 'temping' at a company (typing -- groan)
Passing the hours chatting with the guy next to me (a computer
graphics artist) who has a '71 bus and races old Minis in his
spare time...

Anyway, when he was a schoolboy, his enlightened school
took him &amp; his mates on a school trip to Germany, which included
a day-trip to the VW factory at Hannover.

This was in 1962

He told me he picked up a brochure or something &amp; said he'd
bring it in for me since I seemed so excited about it!

Well, he just gave it to me &amp; it's brilliant. As far as I can make
out (it's all in German), it's some kind of glossy promotional
*magazine* -- with little articles about people &amp; their Split Screen
Vans (an artist, some scientists, etc.) -- a quiz where you have to
guess which close-up pics of interior gadgetry belongs to
which type of van (pick-up, deluxe, camper etc.) -- there's
even a VW bus themed crossword (not filled in!)!!! Cool or
what?!

One of the articles seems to be about a posh German family
celebrating the arrival of their beautiful Deluxe microbus --
one of the photos shows a man sprinkling champagne onto
the bus!!! 

There are also a few tasteful shots of pretty plump German
girls in bikinis (sorry Kathy :-), and a postcard to send off
with the quiz answers written on it.

It's dated III/62 but has alot of early buses in the photos (some
with semaphores, but no barn-doors that I've spotted yet)

Says inside &quot;Transporter-Illustrierte fur Volkwagen-Freunde&quot;
Has anyone every heard of this kind of thing? Was it a regularly
published magazine? Oh, I forgot to say, it's called 
&quot;Flotter Transport&quot; which apparently means &quot;Fleet Transport&quot;??

Alan (who gave it to me) says he also has a Ghia one from the
same trip which he'll look out for me. AND he told me where 
there's an early 911 hiding in the area which is sort of for sale. The
story goes that a German soldier was over here, the car  broke
down, he left it at this motorcycle repair workshop, and never
came back for it. It's reported to be a real mess, but worth a
look I reckon.

My new acquisition will be scanned for your perusal asap along 
with all the other scanning I keep promising you all :-)

Toodles for now...

Sarah
