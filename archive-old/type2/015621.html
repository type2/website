Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure extension hose

Man, you guys are fooling with the lifeblood of your engine. If your setup
is not engineered to twice the level of my skill, you put your bearings at
risk. If you feel the need of a cooler running motor with dry sump and big
oil supply, put in a 911. But that is only if reliable horsepower at the
lowest cost is truly the goal.

&gt;Hi Bob,
&gt;
&gt;I used the brass pipe method of mounting the oil pressure sender on my 
  I usually try to lean the sender against something 
&gt;solid (dizzy, tin, injector rail), but I think the engine vibrations are 
&gt;waving the sender around and enlarging the hole.
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like the flexible hose is the way to go...
