&gt;
&gt;I have a '77 T2 with the 2L FI engine and I am looking for the decel
&gt;valve.  Any suggestions?  I haven't found anyone locally (Houston)
&gt;(besides the dealer -$$$$).
&gt;

Yours is a manual trans and the valve is a large round disc about 4&quot; across?
Or do you have a auto trans and the valve is cylindrical in shape?
Either way I have an extra of each. Your choice, free.
