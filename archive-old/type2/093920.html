History

I was running a stock 1600 DP, CW crank, balanced, vacuum dizzy, and 34
PICT3. Had always gotten lousy gas mileage, but the bus ran good (55psi oil
pressure, 210 oil temp, and 300/325 CHT _at_ 3800 rpm. One day my vacuum gauge
starts going crazy, flipping from 4 to 20&quot;. Did a compression test and found
#3 down. Checked the vacuum with the brake booster disconnected and gauge
did the same thing. OK says I, I've got a bad valve in #3.

I had a rebuilt 1776 with about 200 miles on it (sitting for 4 years) new
case,new Berg everything,new heads, and 009 with dual Kadrons and the dual
Dell's. The vacuum gauge still goes crazy at idle and this engine runs hot
(250 around the Cincinnati Outerbelt (my test drive).

************************************************************
Sounds like gauge line leaks or plugs.
