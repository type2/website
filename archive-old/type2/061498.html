Fellow Volks
Like so many of you, I never actually met Josh but feel I knew him. As a
relative newbie to the list, I've taken great pleasure in watching the threads
develop and reading the impute from the list guru's as they have helped
someone or debated some point of philosophy. One of those voices has been
stilled.
I've learned something amazing about this list and the web, that the stilling
of one voice in one part of the world, can so profoundly effect people in
another part of the world. Maybe we are all one.
My best wishes to his family
