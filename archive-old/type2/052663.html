Subject: [T2] Rear brakes

Howdy folks-

I'm in the middle of a long overdue brake job on my 68 bus.
Front went fine, rear was going fine until I put the second rear 
wheel and drum back on - the shoes drag on the drum, even adjusted 
all the way down.  It was dark, I was tired, I haven't checked my 3 
or 4 other than Bentley manuals or the archives (assuming I can at 
the moment  8^] ) etc, etc.

Is there a simple explanation?  Should I skip my AM moron  pill and 
just go analyze why side A fits and side B doesn't?

Groveling, kowtowing, but not quite begging,
