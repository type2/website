Hi All,

Now I know tires have been done to death on this list but I'm after
something a little different.  Does anyone know of a suitable tire with the
right load rating in a 235/65/15 and 215/65/15.  Just incase you want to
know why, well the Bus is V8 powered with 230hp and I'm planning on painting
it up like an old racer, imagine Herbie but done on a Bus.  Should be a good
laugh to say the least.

Cheers
Steve
