Subject: Re: [T2] Emissions Test Maryland 79 Bus

Anyone notice I changed my sig line about 2 weeks ago?


Current solar cell efficiency is about 6%....the other problem is that 
they are still expensive.

I'm really begining to think about this at home as the prices for 
electricity rise.

Bus Content:  Anyone still have plans for electrifying a bus?

What this country needs is not a 5 cent cigar, but a cheap efficient 
battery...we have all the sunlight we can use....as long as we can store 
the power from it someplace besides biomass or heavy batteries.

Anyone seen the folks that are supposed to be producing the 250m range new 
eletric car that looks kinda like a ferrari or something?...and out 
accelerates it?

The only problem there is that it is expensive to be green...only $100,000


LOL! 

Cheers, dave.

Enough sunlight reaches the Earth *every* hour to meet the world's
energy demand for an entire year...The problem is, that sunlight is free.

&gt; It's not the reactor, per se, that's the problem...It's the nuclear waste...
&gt; Are you ( not personally &quot;you&quot;, the collective &quot;you&quot; ) willing to have the
&gt; waste in your backyard...?-)
&gt; 
&gt; Exxon also spends   &quot;a lot of money&quot; financing studies to refute &quot;global
&gt; warming&quot; (as well as lobbying to retain their &quot;oil depletion allowances&quot;)
&gt; Also, Exxon spends the least of the big oil co's on alternative sources...
&gt; And in terms of profits, I'd like to see what the &quot;actual&quot; cost of oil/gas
&gt; in this country is...? Including subsidies, and the cost of US military/
&gt; foreign aid/ etc. to protect the Mideast sources of oil.
&gt; Sadly, oil has become more (a quick overview of the history of the
&gt; Mideast since the beginning of the 20th C. will bear me out) of an
&gt; economic weapon than merely a commodity...;-(
