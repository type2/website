Subject: High Country Bus Festival - Offical Report

what a wonderful event, I want to thank everyone who attended!

We had approximatly 170 buses make the trek up the mountain this year.

I arrived on Tuesday to start setting up, and found 3 other buses already 
camping.  John, Kurt and David were well on their way to a great week.

We did have some rain, but the hardest rains were on Wed and Thurs before 
most folks arrived.  There were some intermitent showers on Friday - all 
day,  but it gave lots of a chance to get stranded under a random tarp and 
making some new friends.

The weather on Saturday was great,  a little overcast, but no rain,  and a 
great breeze.  What wonderful sleeping weather! (nice and cool)

The Full Moon Bus Club somehow managed to feed the masses again, this always 
amazes me.  Thanks to everyone who donated food...............but the 
biggest thanks go to the cooking and clean-up crew!

Mark Dearing gave a great tech class,  from what I was told.  one of these 
years I would like to go to his class myself, but I always seem to be busy 
with something.  I really appreciate Mark taking the 
time......................this was a vacation from his job of working on 
VW's and I asked him to work on some VW's, ect............... thanks Mark!

Dixie did a great job with the kids activities.  She had a lot of 
help.(Beck, Lori and more)  The kids got to make some cool bird feeders and 
the &quot;BEE-Team&quot; won the scavenger hunt.

We did a  Poker Run, OK let's call it a Poker Walk to raise funds for the 
Full Moon Bus Club.  Anita Nash won $45 with a Queen High Flush!  She then 
kindly donated all of her winnings back to FMBC.......thanks Anita.

Ted-E-Bear ran the 50/50 Raffle for the TYPE 2.list   Some lucky soul won 
$190 and another $190 went to the Type 2 list.

Now for the people's choice awards:
- The People's Choice: (crowd favorite) Maynard Cambell with his &quot;mystery 
machine&quot; vannagon
- The Black Sheep Award - goes to Boyd Smith and his bus that contained a 
300+lb pig!
- Most In need of restoration:  Andrew Strom with his chopped roof splitty
-Dept of Homeland Security; (bus most likely to be pulled by the cops) 
Justin Hinshaw's Tie-Dyed Bay
- Best Group campsite: Mel Wilson and Sharon Houston:  the alien site
- Best Individual Campsite:  goes to Boyd Smith and his bus that contained a 
300+lb pig!

yup, Gurney the 300 lb pig was a huge hit with the crowd.

Then Bessie Mae's Dream took the stage for a first set.  it was a great set!

then the limo arrived and BLISTERED DAWSON jumped out to host the VW FAMILY 
FEUD.
(answers to the survey questions will be posted later)  There were 3 
celebrity judges:  Uncle Fester, rapper Little John (what), and the 
president of Afganistan Harmite Karzia (sic)
The game show was a lot of fun, I have no idea where Blistered Dawson shops 
for his clothes, but I want directions!

After the VW Family Feud,  Bessie Mae's Dream came back out for a second set 
and wrapped up by 11.  lots of fire pits all over the field and friends 
gathering to hang out.  I think I might have even seen one or two folks 
enjoying an adult beverage.

On Sunday Morning folks began to break down camp.  At 10 we began to line up 
for the carabus.

About 60 buses came along for the ride on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  It is 
quite a site to see when the buses go over the Lynn Cove Viaduct - a cool 
bridge the is built off the side cliff of a mountain!
We wrapped up the carabus at Price Park and some folks took off to have 
lunch at the Mellow Muchroom - thus bringing a end to an incredible weekend.
