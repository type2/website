Subject: removing rusty shock sleeve from mounting bolt

i attempted to put my new front shocks on today. the drivers side went on
fine.  the passenger side came off, but the metal sleeve on the lower
mounting bolt for the old shock is rusted onto the mounting bolt.

is it going to take some heat to get this thing off?

any suggestions?

thanks,
