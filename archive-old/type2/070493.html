Getting closer:
* All wood cut, sanded and stained. Will varnish tomorrow (Saturday).
Hopefully install Sunday if dry.
* Jalousie windows ready to install. Will wait until all wood is in just for
a &quot;little&quot; better air flow inside the bus.
* Jalousie window Dust seals:
Recieved more rubber dust seals from M. Heron for the jalousie windows.
Thanks Micheal! Cherry and I sorted through the options last night. Am
considering an experiment with vynil dye to freshen the visual of these.
Talked to Jim at BusBoys about these on Wednesday. He mentioned that it
looks good for a tentative late September release for the (thank goodness!)
repop of these seals.
*Grey plastic trim for around poptop cut out in the woodheadliner:
Bus Boys is still attempting to refine this item. They are hoping to be able
to avoid the four corner mould but may have to inorder to get the corners
correct. This will affect everyone's costs al the way down the line.
* Will clean and detail all of the SO-42 laminated furniture pieces tomorrow.
* Once the interior is mostly completed then we will move on to the final
engine issues (install Dels, mount FF oil filter etc.)
*Am hoping/pushing for a Jerome Jamboree debut. It will be real close. Will
switch to the engineering issues before the final interior details just to
get the thing on the road!!!
