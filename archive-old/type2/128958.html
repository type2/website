 &gt;ATE makes a brake cylinder paste. Comes in a tube that will last forever.
 &gt;Looks like blue grease. I am still on my first tube which I bought 10 years
 &gt;or so ago in Germany.

v
found its part# on ATE web catalog.  It is &quot;ATE Brake Cylinder Paste&quot;
180 gram tube   03.9902-0501.2.    Maybe a local [USA] Mercedes
dealership can order that.   . . .don't know.  The original thread pertained
more to general [non-brake] rubber seal lubrication for those &quot;no grease
means *no* grease&quot; applications.  I just happen to be on a quest for
brake cylinder paste.  [and ATE seal # 3.3302-0032.1 among others]
