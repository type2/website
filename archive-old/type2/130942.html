Subject: electrical problems

Hello, i have a 1970 Campmobile Bus, and the generator light came on about 3 
days ago.  I replaced the generator, and the voltage regulator, and the 
light is no longer on. But whenever i drive at night, the headlights dim 
dramatically, and if i shut it off, it doesn't want to turn over. I am 
draining power, but have no idea how...

Thanks in advance

Alex
