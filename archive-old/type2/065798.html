&gt;Don't remember whether they did so voluntarily (eco-sensitivity is much

You think Germany is eco-sensitive?  :-)

&gt;Question: to retrofit my '75 fuel injected bus with a cat, do I
&gt;necessarily also need the lambda sensor, hence a new brain, new wire
&gt;harness, etc? What about cats for carburated engines?

Don't know for sure, but I suspect you could just bolt one on.  My '85
Mustang (RIP) had a carburator, two catalytic converters, and no exhaust
sensors of any kind.  Ran strong and clean, too.
