Subject: Engine/Trans Pull

Dearest 2be's,

Mr. Schwarze has a point here.  Having dropped engines both with and
without trans, I would say that with trans makes a few things easier and a
few harder.  You must unbolt the CV's or entire axles.  You should be doing
this anyway if you haven't greased or inspected or cleaned your CV's
anytime recently.  Unbolting the two front trans mount bolts and shift
linkage is no harder than the four engine bolts.  You get to inspect and
renew the fuel filter inside the tank.  You get to inspect and renew the
fuel lines.  Dumping both trans and engine on the ground is no big deal,
I've used a log up front.  You might want a second jack when re-installing.
 When you attach the engine to the trans on the ground there is no fight,
it's actually rather fun.  When they both go back in you get the trans
lipped on it's mount and raise the back.  Perhaps it's different with the
type 4 but I doubt it.  I suppose it's trickier if you can't roll the bus
back over the assembly and have to push it under.  These days, I too drop
both.

&gt;What's the hardest for me is getting that mother back up on the jack
&gt;when I put it back in. You have to push it under the car, then use a
&gt;long pry bar and fulcrum and gradually block it up on each side until
&gt;you can fit the jack under the engine. Now how the hell you would do
&gt;that with a tranny attached, I have no clue. Sure don't want to try it
&gt;by my lonesome.

I pick/roll it up one side and slide/work a 2x4 and rolling floor jack
under the center of the 2x4.  The trans doesn't really affect this and even
helps by putting a pivot point up front.  Perhaps the type 4's are harder. 

This reminds me of what I used to do with the 1971 &amp; 1969 squarebacks.  I
made 2x8's with notches at the top and placed them inside the car, centered
over the engine and tight against the sides.  Then I put a cross-bar of
thick-wall 1-1/4&quot; steel square stock on top of them.  Then I used a cable
type come-along to raise and lower the engine and occasionally the trans
too into place.  I only dumped the assembly once when the 2x8's rocked,
spun and dropped the load.

Perhaps something like this could work for the newer buses that have the
top engine access panel.
