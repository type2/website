That's the best deal ever. I've been using the part number I've collected to source the odd one here and there but you got a true deal.

&gt;Supposedly the cable goes
&gt;through the union nut..which screws onto the thermostat, but what
&gt;keeps the cable in there?

The hole in the union nut is smaller than the ferrule crimped on the end of the cable. You remove the union nut, thread the cable through and then it's secured inside.
