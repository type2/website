Hello All,
I  seem to recall someone posting the name and address and tele # for the
stateside distributor of Waxoyl.
Seems as though it might have been in Iowa, or that neck of the woods.

I do have, from my filing system, the following for contact:
Moss Motors; PO Box 847; 440 Rutherford St.; Goleta, CA ,  93116. 
1-800-667-7872. 

Does anyone have info on the main USA contact point for product
distribution and channel management?
I am looking to have serious professional rustproofing done here in
Houston.

Thanks for any recalls of info.

Bob in Houston.
