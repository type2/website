Dustin:
One thing you need to do (and it MAY not be obvious), is take out the front
shifter tube. The tube goes between the two axle tubes and has to be removed
first.
Getting the center clamp out was a real bear in my 69, I think I ended up
cutting the clamp with a parting wheel and then re-welding it.

&gt; First, thank you to Joe Mitchell at Busted VW.  Much appreciated on that
&gt; axle deal.  What a deal!  You're saving my butt.  My bus is my only vehicle,
&gt; so thanks again.
&gt; I have a feeling I'm going to learn alot on this replacement.  I'm looking
&gt; forward to it actually.  I know its gonna be tough.
