Subject: engine fire protection - marine extinguishers

this seems like a good idea as a supplement to proper maintenance, a
nice thing to know you have just in case, because as we all know &quot;SH*T
Happens&quot;..  the activation temp is 175 degrees. how hot does the engine
compartment on a
bus get at normal to heavy operation?  Would we have a problem with
premature
activation?

&gt; An idea I have been playing with is the engine compartment fire
&gt; extinguishers they sell in the marine catalogs
&gt;
