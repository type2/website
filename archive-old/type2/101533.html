Subject: Bosch WR1

I was going to ask the best way to weatherproof the Bosch WR-1 starter relay
when I was reading through the archives and found a post that said to mount
it in the engine compartment where it's already dry instead of drilling a
hole in the body to mount it (among other suggestions).

I was thinking of mounting the relay from one of the screws holding the
voltage regulator to the firewall.  I haven't tried yet but the archive post
suggested that the length of the wires from the relay are long enough and
this location is close to the wire pass through grommet on the firewall
below.

Has anyone done it this way?
