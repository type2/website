Subject: Friday RUSTY bus sighting...

Happy Friday, listees!

Driving home from work today, passed Notre Dame Academy (a high school?) 
in West Los Angeles on Overland Avenue...

The campus of this school is immaculate, they must have a hundred 
gardeners working there non-stop, the buildings themselves are beautiful 
- it's really quite a visual oasis as you drive down the street.

Anyway, I glance over today and what do I see amongst the shiny 
late-model Lexuses and Mercedes in the parking lot, right in front of 
the main door to the school, but the absolute rustiest 68-71 bus on the 
planet.  It looked like it might once have been white, but I don't think 
there was a rust-free spot on the whole bus!  I think the owner was 
trying to GROW rust for a science project or something...

Don't get me wrong, my heart skipped a beat and I gazed lovingly at it, 
but I can only imagine what the upper crust must have thought!

Is the owner on this list, perhaps?
