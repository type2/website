Subject: Re: [T2] cyl heads loose

Your info is contradictory.
Fresh rebuild can't pass muster? Leaking oil,
blowby, heads loose, but not losing compression ?
You can't have it both ways.
The defective dizzy will cause bad timing,
and it won't be long before the engine siezes.
Overheat it once, and it will be all your fault.
Loose heads that don't hold retorque
is studs pulling. There are a number
of solutions for that. 8 or 10mm studs?
Compression? Verify it yourself, along with oil pressure.
 Do you have a receipt for this job?
What's the going rate in NZ?
