Hi All,

Searched the Library and archives, but could not find the answer for this
one. the turn signals and emergency flashers on my 70 Westy all work fine,
but the Turn signal indicator lights on my dash both *blink* when I use my
turn signals. Left or right makes no difference, they both flash, while the
operation of the outside lights is correct. Anybody have this happen? I am
going to try and fix my horn today so I can get a sticker and do some
camping this weekend. I adjusted the brakes yesterday and went for my first
long ride in the bus with some friends last night. Big S**t eating grin on
my face the whole time. By the way, this being my first extended time in the
bus, does it always feel a little weird at first to be ahead of the front
tires? I think I need new shocks, because the ride was very bouncy and a
little strange.

Thanks for any input

Jeff
