&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; Everyday is drive your VW to work day for me -- even in here in sunny

For those of you &quot;taking the bus&quot; to work tommorrow there is a neat flyer
that I will be putting in my window. Check it out at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Garage/5901/idmt2_1.jpg

&gt; Las Vegas (108 degrees is the forecast for today!!). Roll down the front
&gt; windows, crank open the jalousie windows and keep moving!! 
&gt; 
&gt; For those interested -- with my external cooler and a well sealed engine
&gt; compartment oil temps stay about 210-215 degrees around town.
&gt; 
&gt; Drive on!!
&gt; 
210-215 in stop and go driving is impressive considering 112+ isn't
unusual there, and (which Scott didn't mention) is the fact that he is
running an 1835cc.

BTW I need an oil bypass valve for my external oil cooler...where should I
look?

See you all on the road tommorrow!
