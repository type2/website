The PO put a removable heater in our van by tapping into the stove
propane line under the sink (on 81 Vanagon).  He used a shut off valve
and union that allows the heater to be removed.  Otherwise if stores in
the cabinet under the sink.  DON'T go to sleep using these, even with
ventaltion. I also wouldn't use one of these if alone, if you dose off,
bad things can happen.  A family/group of 5 or 6 died in their tent a
couple of years ago near Cape Cod doing just that.  Consequently, I have
no plans to use this thing  I used to tenting it anyway, A van to sleep
in is a luxury enough without needing heat can't .  No I don't use the
van in the winter - salted roads.  Yes I do use the tent in the winter so
far to 15 deg below zero.

Heaters, we don't need no stinking heaters
