Subject: coil wires? revisited

Well, we finally got to check out the coil etc.  looks like the wires are
fried..... there is no power getting to the back at all... but, there are no
fuses blown either...points are fried.... not sure about all the rest.....
didn't have tester handy.... will do that tomorrow.... Hopefully, it will
not turn out to be a full rewire job on the whole bus.... but.... it is
looking like it......
any ideas any one?
Thanks......
