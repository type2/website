Subject: Woodstock Edition Bus

Hello List.

When we purchased our bus, a '69 Campermobile.  We were told that it was
a woodstock edition.  Does anyone have any information about this or
anything close?
I have never herd any reference to anything close to this.

Ant light on the subject would be nice.
