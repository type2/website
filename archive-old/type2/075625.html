Subject: Re: [T2] Westy interior panel patterns

&gt; I could generate patterns in AutoCad .dwg or .dxf
&gt; &gt;files if that would help.  Let me know
&gt;
&gt; That is something that BELONGS in the archives for sure!  Me, I have
&gt; replaced all my panels with 1/8th wood panels stained Red Mahogany held on
&gt; with brass screws but what I need now are the wood roof panel patterns,
&gt; which I plan on using formica paneling (some cool blue marble pattern or
&gt; such)


How about getting hardtop as well as poptop patterns?? cool daddio......
