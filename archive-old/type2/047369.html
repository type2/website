Hi,

 Honda engines arn't noted for their low-end torque. You need plenty of
torque for a
bus because it is big &amp; heavy (the alternative is a close ratio gearbox and
a lot of
effort on the part of the driver).

 I would compare the torque curve of the Honda 1.6 with, say, a VW 2.0
pancake
(67 SAE hp_at_4200, 101 lb/ft_at_ 3000) and make sure it is better before
proceeding,
otherwise you may find you have a bus that's hard work to keep rolling and
no
fun to drive.

Cheers,
