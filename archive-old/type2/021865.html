Subject: Re: [T2] towing my bus

nevermind!!  I found a local place to drop my engine and in return I'm 
going to help someone else out pull their engine from their ford.  I 
only have to travel about 1.5 miles and the bus'll make it that far :)

woo hoo!!

thanks,
Mike

&gt; I need to tow my bus 18 miles.  What is the best way to go about doing 
&gt; this?  My friend's dad has a shop in anaheim where we'll be able to drop 
&gt; my engine and swap it out into my other bus and then tow it back.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anyone in the long beach, CA area that has a tow bar or tow 
&gt; dolly which I could borrow or rent?  I have a 78 westy and my friend has 
&gt; a 2000 ford ranger...
&gt; 
&gt; I am debating doing it in my garage, but I'll only be able to jack up 
&gt; the car about 15 inches.  Is this enough?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Mike
