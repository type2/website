Subject: chassis outriggers etc and hundredweights
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Dear all,
Have been enjoying your obsessive rants etc for a
little while now. Am writing for the first time.

I have my 71 Danbury conversion (English paupers
version of a Westfalia - but rather good), perched
high in the air at the moment (well, just high enough
to weld under). I have been busy with an anglegrinder,
and as always have found more rust than I had
anticipated. I have removed the underbelly-pans (I'm
not actually sure if American models had these) and
have revealed that the chassis outriggers with jacking
points (i.e. the four forwardmost ones) need
replacing. The outer sills (I think you guys call them
rockers) also need replacing. The van's rear wheels
are on ramps, and the front is supported on blocks
under the front portion of the chassis rails forward
of the front wheels. My question is is it OK to take
out the sills and the chassis outriggers with the van
supported in this way? Will it fold in half? Or
distort somehow?

Is there anything else I should know before attempting
to replace the outriggers/sills?

By the way Bob, a hundredweight, as the name suggests,
is equal to 112 pounds. These are English Imperial
pounds of course not your American ones. I don't know
how you convert to US, but in metric a hundredweight
works out at 50.80235 kg. 

Why does my van have nuts and bolts in metric and
imperial?

Yours,
Ben, Sheffield, UK
