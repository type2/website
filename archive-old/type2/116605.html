Subject: RE: [T2] Westy Rear Speaker Location

&gt; I'm just looking for good ideas on where I could move my rear speakers.
&gt;

I havent done this yet, but here is my plan.

I removed the &quot;head knocker&quot; cabinet from above the back seat.
I am going to buy two 6X9 speakers and wedge style truck speaker boxes from
Cutchfield (Wally World has them also). I am planning on bloting them to the
area where the cabinet was. Hopefully using the existing holes.

It is important to me to have the speakers facing forward and have them high
up so nothing gets in the way of the sound.
I have already installed a CD player and replaced the door speakers, so the
back speakers are my next step.

Hope this gives you an idea. It may be possible to do something similar
without removing the cabinet.
