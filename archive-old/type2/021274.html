Peet:
This has happenen to me on the 80 Vanagon, too. I think mine backfired! I assume the hoses were the two to the deceleration valve? someone wrote about this about a year ago as well and I think the learned reasoning it was some kind of safety valve to protect the AFM in case of a backfire.Backfires are usually a symptom of being too lean or sometimes WAY out of
time, but out of time probably does not apply if you were just driving it.
I'd just put them back on and see if it happens again, then if it does, look for the problem.

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; So, I hop in the '78 Riviera bus yesterday a.m. to go to the airport and she fires up, then promptly dies.  I tried a couple of more times, and it sounds like it is being choked out.  I look in back and all the hoses had become disconnected!
