Subject: Speedo test and tires....

The question about testing the speedo and tire size got me thinking about
something.

The bus I just bought had 195/75 14's.
When I checked the user manual and the sticker on the steering column they
both said 185's.

I noticed a few posts referencing using 195's of various profiles.

Barring the obvious desire for a different look or performance issues,
should I been running 195's for some reason?

I put 185/70's just like the book said. The bus is a '79 2.0L.

Also, I live in Montana and being the middle of winter I don't need to
introduce conditions that might hinder traction and control.

Thanks,

Bill
