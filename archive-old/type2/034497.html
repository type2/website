&gt; Hey, gang. I'll be driving to Texas and points more
&gt; southerly from Connecticut. I'm leaving Monday, Jan 3,
&gt; expect to go through NY, MD, VA or WV, KY, TN, GA, AL,
&gt; MS, LA, TX, if anyone needs a lift, talk, or both.
&gt; Hopefully I can bump into Clark this time.
&gt; 
&gt; In the meantime, I had a question: noticing that,
&gt; while the blower fan on my type 4 motor only goes on
&gt; with the heat switch all the way down, it cools the
&gt; exhaust (and the heads some, presumably) while going.
&gt; Somewhere along the line my blower fan switch is not
&gt; working, but I got to wondering: since the flaps can
&gt; control whether or not the heat goes to the cab or out
&gt; under the car, and the blower cools the heads, why not
&gt; have it on all the time? I think the switch problem is
&gt; in the little silver box that plugs into the fan body,
&gt; since the fan works hooked up in other ways and the
&gt; hot wire (red) from up near the cab with the inline
&gt; fuse is hot, and nothing in the dash seems amiss.
&gt; Anybody tried this? Any reason NOT to have the fan on
&gt; constantly?
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Ian
