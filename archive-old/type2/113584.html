Subject: Re: [T2] Free fiberglass poptop

&gt;My '52 Chevy pickup had one...Expect a lot of horns at intersections,
&gt;though...
&gt;It's hard enough to see an overhead traffic light already; unless you also
&gt;get the little mirror gizmo that sits on your dash and allows you to see al-
&gt;most straight up... ;-)

Lots of wind noise too. I've even heard of a few cracked windshields from 
wind buffeting at highway speeds. Only seen them on 30'2 and 40's and a few 
50's cars.
