Subject: Admin - Jetta CV Boots

Folks,
This is most certainly not a Jetta list.  The engine's not even at the right
end of the car!

The list content rules here are very simple.  If it's not bus-related, don't
post it.  Am I not saying it clearly enough?  It doesn't seem like a complex
concept.

Perhaps rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled would be a more appropriate forum
for a Jetta discussion.
