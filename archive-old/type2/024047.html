Subject: Pop-Top Canvas Replacement

I have a 1971 Riviera conversion pop-top camper. The canvas needs work. It's
not actually canvas, but some sort of yellow plastic thing. The screens need
some work and the zipper to access the roof top cargo area is broken. I'm
thinking of either replacing this or at the very least taking it off and
fixing the problems.

Has anyone done this? How hard is this thing to get off? Does anyone know of
a good source for this item if I decide the old one is beyond repair?
