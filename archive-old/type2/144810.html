Subject: CVJ update

in short ... we're rolling once again!  test drive went smoothly.  now
for the long.

once i got the CVJ off of the driveshaft again and got it all cleaned. i
still struggled putting it back together correctly.  it wasn't until i
recalled someone mentioned the cvj stuff in the type2 library.  after
reading tom carrington's cvj servicing atricle it made sense.  the
pictures of the front and back brought it all home.  it was finally
together correctly.

i greased it up and set out to install the driveshaft.  the wheel side
went in pretty easy.  torqued per bentleys and all was well there.  the
tranny side was much more difficult.  my arm still hurts from holding up
that damn driveshaft.  after much cursing i got one the bolts started.
the rest came pretty easy from there.  three turns of the wheel and i was
washing my arms and hands and changing clothes for the test drive.

i want to thank everyone for all the help and encouragement.  i learned a
TON doing this...mostly to buy the damn complete driveshaft with CVJs and
boots from busdepot for $119!!!!!!!!!!  just kidding  :)
