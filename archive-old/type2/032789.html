Steve....wanted to say thank you, both personally and publicly for your 
article on Sliding door maintenance.  My '73 was having a real problem of 
shutting without a very hard pull, often many times.  I remembered that I had 
saved your maintenance location, re-read the instructions, found I was 
missing the two rear bolts.... took the whole assembly apart, cleaned, 
reassembled, installed the missing bolts....WOW.
The door slided shut like silk, very little effort.

So...thanks...the words and pictures made the job very easy.  It is the best 
hour and a half I have spent on the '73, and the best results.  And thanks 
for all the work you, Ken and George do at keeping this list such a great 
resource for all of us.
