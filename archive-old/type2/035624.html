Subject: bad karma to a listee?

Before Xmas we had a round of karma-giving, wherein folks offerred parts up
to thems what needed them. Being a practical man, I asked for someone to
toss a rear bumper for a 70 in to the pool  :), whereupon I would turn
loose motor parts, wiper motors, whatever seemed like folks might need.

Sadly, Matthew not only failed to send the bumper ( I was going to pay
shipping), but no longer responds to pmails.
So I still need a rear bumper for a 70, and I still need to dig out a part
for the List to snag. I will do the latter later tonight; if anyone HAS a
bumper, please pmail me.

And Matt... I would do a LOT of preventative maintenance for the next few
months ;)
