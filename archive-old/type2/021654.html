Subject: Re: [T2] Adapting engine rebuild stand for running in ?

ToobWiz_at_aol_dot_com wrote:

&gt; I've got one of those floor stands (Harbor Freight, et.al.) which has a
&gt; rotating trunnion with 4 articulated arms to hold the engine. Each arm has a
&gt; &quot;bushing&quot; on the end to take an engine mounting bolt.
&gt;
&gt; I was unable to get the basic T4 engine to fit for rebuilding, so I did that
&gt; work on the workbench.
&gt;  Has anyone used one
&gt; of these stands with the bellhousing and starter? What mods or fixtures did
&gt; you have to make to fit?

Don,

I did that very thing, using
   1. the stand, remove the atriculated arms
   2. a plate of 1/4&quot; steel  (maybe even 3/8&quot;)
   3. an old bellhousing

- I cut the plate large enough to cover the bell housing mounting holes.
- Drilled the plate to match the holes
- Welded the plate to the flange that the articulated arms bolted to
- Bolted the bell housing up to the plate
- Installed back into engine stand
- Bolted engine &amp; starter up to bellhousing.

Worked like a champ for me.  I can take some pics if needed.
Hardest part was getting the metal cut, which ended up being quite easy as I had
the metal house cut it out of their scrap with their umpteen ton sheer.

Hope this helps
