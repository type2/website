when you say &quot;rearranged&quot; to accomodate a wheelchair do you just mean the
seats and things or does it have the ramp and drop floor modification from
HP-bus (only one I know who did it).

I have one of the HP-bus modifications and in my research I have not heard
of any being done before 1975.   and in fact all were auto tranny buses
because of shift linkange problems.
