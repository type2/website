CV Joints

Biggest problem I had was that you have to really clean out the centers of
the CV bolts or the Allen or triple square drive socket will not fit.  Be
sure to order the 8mm triple drive socket if that is the kind of bolt you
have.  Nothing else will fit.   Another tip that now seems obvious, is keep
the wheels off the ground and the transmission in neutral so you can rotate
each tire to get each bolt into a good position for your socket wrench. 

I agree this is not a hard job.  Just be sure to keep the joints level
because if they fall apart they are a bitch to reassemble. Not impossible
but frustrating.  Speaking from experience

Mmmm...
It's winter, well for me! so take the time and do the job yourself!
Don't only change the boot, degrease/re-grease and inspect velocity joint.
I did this da*n job 8 times so i now what i am talking about.

It's a nice job (Not), but an easy job. (2 hours per joint, 8hours for a 
nice job)
Buy german/good boot from Ron or other, if one (or more) velocity joint 
is worn, replace with german made velocity joint.
$40 complete axle = scrap and cheap stuff!
Remember to clean the inside of the wheel hub and trany hub, they are 
full of... stuff!
