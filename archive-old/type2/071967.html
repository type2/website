&gt;Just bought a 1978 Type 2 Camper Van - Viking Conversion - chose it
&gt;because of the layout and the heating system worked, but ignored the fact
&gt;it was heavy to get in and out of gears.
&gt;
&gt;Got worse and limped into a local garage where they pulled the clutch out
&gt;and down to bare metal. They put in a new clutch and got going again -
&gt;witin a few miles (about 20) it was back difficult to change gear again.
&gt;
&gt;Limped home and got the engine dropped - the new clutch has gone in a
&gt;matter of a few miles - the metal backing is blue and the clutch material
&gt;is worn and broken up on one side.

My guess is that the clutch was not adjusted properly and was slipping.
The blue (overheated) metal is a strong indicator of that.  Which side is
broken up?  Flywheel side or pressure plate side?  This should give you a
hint.

&gt;1) The guy I bought it off put in the wrong clutch type, realised it was a
&gt;problem and sold it on to me quick. The first garage just changed the worn
&gt;clutch for one exactly the same type, and it went straight away again.
&gt;2) The first garage put the wrong one in by mistake

I doubt it.

&gt;3) There is a nack to setting up the clutch - if you dont get it right it
&gt;wears within a few miles

Nope, it's very straightforward.

&gt;4) I'm just unlucky

I doubt this too.  Clutches don't just fail for no reason.

&gt;Any ideas as to which is most likely - can you mix up the clutch types and
&gt;get one that nearly works, but doesnt last.

If the clutch disc lines up with the pressure plate and flywheel properly,
it shouldn't wear out quickly, even if it is one of the smaller sets from
an earlier year.

&gt;Is there any way of checking which clutch type fits which engine ?
&gt;
&gt;Details
&gt;Engine no CJ100346
&gt;1970CC
&gt;Year 1978

You should have a 228mm clutch set, which was I believe the same size used
&gt;from 76-79, and possibly even up to 82 with the aircooled Vanagon, although
that last part is just a guess.
