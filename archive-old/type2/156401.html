&gt; Hi all,
&gt; just a follow up on my low pressure issues, I have run the motor now with a spacer
&gt; under the relief spring, results look promising.
&gt; What it has not affected though is idle pressure, which is now ~11psi _at_700rpm &amp;
&gt; 190F oil.
&gt; So I guess that means some excess clearance on the bearings?

Yep.  Your relief valve is compltely closed at idle, so the pressure is
determinded by what slips by the bearings.
