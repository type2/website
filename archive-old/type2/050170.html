Subject: [T2] Westy Water Tank Crack

Greetings list -

Happy New Year!! I'm back out of digest mode for the day to get wisdomed-up.

1969 Westy. I have a 1&quot; crack in the bottom of the plastic fresh water tank
adjacent to the threaded drain hole. Water does leak through this crack. The
crack looks fixable. I have thought of either using super glue or hitting it
with a soldering iron tip. I have also thought of screwing a greased-up tube
inside the drain thread (so the tube sticks inside the tank about two
inches), pouring some sort of epoxy inside the tank then removing the tube -
extreme, but what else is one to ponder whilst peering into a plastic water
tank?

Any suggestions are heartily welcome.
