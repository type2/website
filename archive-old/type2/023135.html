Concerning the carpet underlayment - will it hold water? - seems like any 
foam underlayment that will combined with a leaky seam or window means 
deadly rust!

Has anyone used carpet underlayment and treated it with a waterproofer or 
??? to deal with this?

I plan to do begin the interior of my '78 Westy and are debating between 
underlayment (CHEAP!) or industrial neoprene used to sound proof and 
insulate - available locally and in a variety of thicknesses - check the 
Grainger catalog (website) for examples. The Grainger selection is a closed 
cell foam so I doubt it is a very good sponge.

I got a sample of the stuff that the local supplier offers (not a Grainger 
franchise) and it didn't hold water well and dried very quickly. Seems to 
fit the bill well.

The underlayment is much cheaper I suppose (I haven't tested it for water 
absorbtion) but the industrial stuff was good too (didn't hold water).

I'm not going to the extremes Bulley-Hewitt did, but I'll cover the floor, 
inside of the door panels, top of the engine compartment (in the 
compartment), the seat pedestals, inside the nose (since my dash is out and 
the factory 1/4&quot; styrofoam was a joke!), and some on the ceiling under the 
upholstery I'll put up there (doubt the old Westy wallpaper was much good 
anything related to heat or noise).

I'm not too crazy about filling any body cavities with anything but linseed 
oil (not Great Stuff foam). Seems like a good way to trap moisture. I'll 
replace the factory vapor barriers I want some small drafts to dry out the 
body cavities. Maybe some Great Stuff to connect the outer panels to the 
inner bracing to kill the drumming thing.

I'll be running the OEM style rubber mat in the front foot well and I'm 
going to try to find orginal style seat pedestal rubber (anyone lead me to 
some?) as I tend to get the floor up front pretty dirty.

Any more suggestions?
