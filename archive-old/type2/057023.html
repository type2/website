Subject: Bus won't stay running! 

Hello again!

I've got a ''77 bus (breadloaf) with 2.0 FI engine.  My wife picked me up
from the airport yesterday evening, and it ran fine.  This morning when we
got up, it started up but then died about 1-2 seconds later.  Start it
again, it runs for about 1/2 a second.  After that, it just turns over.  

I'm mystified!  It's got a new fuel pump and fuel filter (6 months old), and
I just had the starter done a week ago (not that I believe it has anything
to do with that...).  I don't know anything about fuel injected systems, and
was hoping that someone could think of anything.

Also, I waited about 5 minutes and jumped in to try it again.  This time I
put the gas pedal to the floor, and started it.  It stayed started, but ran
really rough!  I fluttered the pedal, becuase it was always on the verge of
dying.  As soon as I took my foot off the pedal, it died.  I think I heard
it backfiring while it was reved high.

Thanks in advance,
Marcus
