Subject: Only second gear

Need some advice. Have an 82 type2 with 190,000 and today it decided to only 
go into second gear. The linkage feels strange like there is no fork. I looked 
under the van and the transmission linkage is very loose. The relay lever is 
very loose and the guide pin ring is gone. I had replaced the gearshift lever 
bushings about a year ago as they were totally shot. How do I determine if it 
is linkage or the transmission? If it could be the linkage, any 
recommendations on where to get the parts? If it is the transmission, how much could this 
set me back? Muir says dump it if the tranny is gone. My wife says dump it 
period; she just doesn't understand.

Jon
