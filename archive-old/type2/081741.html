Subject: Tires --  no MX

Hey guys,
Well I checked around and no one around here seems to know of the Michelin
MX reinforced tire.  Bob, I checked to see if there was an NTB around and
the nearest one is 50 miles away, so I won't be going that route :-)

Looking at Michelin's web site they don't list it anymore either so I'm
assuming it's out of production and those that are left are already in
various tire retailer warehouses.

I talked to the local guys and also looked on the web site and it looks like
the only applicable current Michelin is the Agilis.  The Agilis comes in
185R14 and with the proper load rating.  Actually a better load rating than
the MX.

It's looking like I'll just get a couple of the Agilis tires and make the
other good MX my spare, since my spare tire is shot anyway.  Before I do
that (I figure the Agilis will probably be around $100/tire) I wanted to see
if anyone has any recommendations for CURRENTLY AVAILABLE tires in the
proper size and load rating.  I'm not interested in changing sizes, so no
195/75R14 users need apply :-)

Also does anyone have any experience with the Agilis as far as performance
in wet weather, snow, etc?

Thanks!
