 The TSB says the 90 degree turn of the wrench doesn't have to be done in one
 go: it can be done gradually.

A 90 degree turn past initial torque on a stretch bolt is ALWAYS done in one shot.

I cannot believe the TSB says to do it gradually!

No matter what article you read on TTY bolts [stretch or Torque To Yield], they never say to 
do it in increments or gradually. You always do it in one movement.
