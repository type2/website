Subject: Re: [T2] Recommended Compression Ratio for today's fuels?

&gt;Hi All:
&gt;
&gt;I am looking for opinions on compression ratios for today's fuels that
&gt;minimize heat build up on my heads. I will be running a stock type IV
&gt;2.0L engine (hydraulic cam, valves, etc.), fuel injected, 87 octane
&gt;fuel, as a daily driver pushing around a 5000 lb Vanagon Westy.

A 5,000lb Vanagon Westy?  Day-am!

I just posted this to the TDI-conversion list this morning so I don't even have to retype it:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;82 Westfalia diesel is rated at 5292 lbs.

I think you already know this but in case anyone else is not aware, that is Gross weight.  Subtract the one-ton cargo capacity and the base vehicle weight is around 3300lbs.  Add a couple hundred for Westy/camping equipment and you have the true Net or curb weight of the Vanagon, about 3500lbs.

There are lots of people running around saying they have 5000lb+ vanagons.  They all looked at the sticker in the door but did not understand what it meant.  They all have ~3500lb Vanagons.

All weights I just described are U.S.lbs, divide by 2.2 to convert to kilograms.
