Tom,

Our baby is 10 months old now and I love my bus. It is just a bay window but
I would love to have all of the creature comforts you have. I thought I
wanted a new car when I was pregnant but having the bus is great. We took the
middle seat out for everyday use because it's much easier to get the baby in
and out. Plus the bus holds everything! Plenty of room for the stroller and
all the baby stuff you seem to need when you go out. Tell your wife she will
love driving the bus. I know I do!
