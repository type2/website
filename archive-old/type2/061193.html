&gt; Subject: Brake Fluid Reservoir '71
&gt;
&gt; I have a '71 with the brake fluid reservoir mounted behind the driver's
&gt; seat and it is separate from the master cylinder/booster which of course is
&gt; under the bus.  The problem is that the reservoir itself is leaking either
&gt; at the seam in the plastic or at the rubber gasket so that it is completely
&gt; empty overnight and the fluid is in a nice puddle on the seat base.
&gt;
&gt;  Has anyone replaced this with another type of reservoir like a Ford or
&gt; Chevy etc. since I believe the OEM one is no longer available?


You are right that the OEM one is no longer avail. (That is what the
local dealers and a couple of aftermarket places told me.)

I fixed mine by cleaning it out really well with soap and HOT
water, dried it in the sun for a couple of hours, 
roughed up the cracked seam with a rasp, then used
some $2 epoxy to seal up the crack. No more leaks.

If it is emptying all the way out, the crack is prob.
around the tube on the bottom. Mine was along
the mounting tab on the back.

Getting another reservoir to fit the tube tightly
worried me, so I fixed the one I had. It was out,
fixed and back in overnight. I used slow cure epoxy
but left it under a desklamp all night to hard cure.

Good luck!
