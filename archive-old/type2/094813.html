Subject: Re: [T2] Painting muffler



&gt;
&gt;My Hecho en México muffler I bought locally to get my bus running is
&gt;starting to burn off the paint after only 2 months.

	Did you paint it yourself?  The grey 'paint' is actually just a primer, and 
will burn off rather quickly.  You can just paint over it, but the thing to 
do would be having it beadblasted clean, degreased, and THEN painted.  I had 
this done and the muffler looked great for years.  The Bar-B-Cue paint will 
work, but it isn't intended to be used on such a rough service part.  
Bar-B-Cues arent pelted with rocks and dirt.  You may want to use an 
automotive paint like Krylon, PlastiKote, or VHT.

	Eron
