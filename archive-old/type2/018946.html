&gt;         The round numbers are just that- round numbers. 1700 is really 1679,
&gt; 1800 is 1795 and 2.0 is 1971cc. Then there are the non-stock configurations,
&gt; like 1776, which is a popular over-bore of the 1600, which is realy 15xx of
&gt; course.
&gt;         VW's 'round number' aircooled displacements were 1100, 1200, 1300, 1500,
&gt; 1600, 1700, 1800 and 2000cc. 11-1600 were Type 1/2 cases, the 'upright'
&gt; fan shroud style, as found in Beetles and busses through '71 in the USA.
&gt; 1700 through 2.0 are Type 4 engines, pancake style, installed in busses
&gt; from 72 to 83 (early Vanagon). NONE of these engines has the actual
&gt; round number displacement in ccs.
&gt;         The precise numbers, like 1776, usually indicate aftermarket
&gt; bigbore or long stroke or both setups. Unless you're talking with
&gt; someone who KNOWS what the actual displacement of a 1600 is and
&gt; likes slinging the number around the impress folks.
&gt;         So when in doubt, ask, as you have done.
JT, Bill, list:
Well boys and girls, it's not rocket science to do the math yourself
(it's more like hot-rodder science).
What we're dealing with here is finding the volume of 4 cylinders.
V= pi x radius(half the bore) squared x h(the stroke)x 4
A simple trick that works with 4 cylinder motors is to just use the bore
dimension  squared (which will be 4 times the radius squared) and then
don't multiply by 4; so for a 4 cylinder the displacement formula is:
v= pi x d (the bore) squared x h (the stroke)

The other handy thing to remember is to start with the kinda units you
want to finish with, i.e., want the result in cc's(centimeters cubed)
use dimensions in cm. going in, want the result in cubic inches, use
inches going in, want the  results in cubic miles, use miles going in
(warning-this will be an extremely small number).
On second thought I guess it IS rocket science- oops, lost another $100
million satellite! (I digress.)
The numbers for a stock 1600 are bore= 85.5mm (8.55cm)and stroke= 69mm
(6.9cm.)
displacement for a stock 1600 then is:
v= 3.14 x 8.55cm. x 8.55cm. x 6.9cm = 1583.8 cm cubed (cc.)
common type 4 motors: 1700 bore 9.0 cm. stroke 6.6 cm.
		      1800 bore 9.3 cm. stroke 6.6 cm.
		      2000 bore 9.4 cm. stroke 7.1 cm.
You can do the math yourself now! (I'm sure most could before!)
