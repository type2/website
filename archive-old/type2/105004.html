&gt; &gt; I like to grab as many relays and fuses as I can when I'm perusing the

&gt; One problem with the ceramic fuses is that they can accumulate corrosion,
&gt; causing excessive heat if the fuse is reused.  I have reused fuses, but
&gt; some have become rather hot and been unreliable in service.  Others have
&gt; been fine.  Go figure!

The fuse discussion has come up on the Karmann Ghia list in the past and one of
the points made was that dissimilar metals cause a chemical reaction that serves
to build up resistance. So if you have copper wiring going to copper connectors
and copper fuse holders and then stick steel fuses in you will get a degradation
in performance over time. There are 2 varieties of the original style fuses on
the market, one made of copper and the other not so look for the copper ones.
