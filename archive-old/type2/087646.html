Subject: RE: [T2] 72-79 Pressure Plate bolts

&gt;Karl is one the money with the 74-75 flywheel having 7mm bolts!  They are
&gt;7mm x 1.00 thread x 20mm long.  This also will give you a 11mm head instead
&gt;of that cursable triple square [12 point] head.

FWIW I like the &quot;cursed 12 point head&quot; as I'm assuming you mean
a male 12 point, as in just put on a 12 point socket, which if they
are the same as the GTI/FWD 7mm bolts is a nice readily availble
american size like 11/32.  (well it fits perfectly anyway)

On the rabbits these are nice grade 10.9 bolts and the small heads
(larger hit things) encourage people to find the right grade instead of
putting any ole bolt in which can happen on the 8mm quite easily.

Anyway just my opinion, if the 74-75 used a recessed 7mm triple
square, that must be a nightmare, as I've oddly never owned an
1800 I have absolutely no idea.
