Subject: Call for scans of campers (for Friday project)

Hi all,

I suspect this really should be a Friday post, but since a few of us are
working on this *for* a Friday thing (but need the info sooner), I hope
it's OK...

You might recall the &quot;repugnant ad&quot; thread from last week: we're working to
subvert the ad by substituting a VW camper with a popped top for the Lex*s
in the the ad, and &quot;enhancing&quot; the ad copy somewhat.

I need help obtaining a good quality scan of a VW camper in camping mode
(pop-top up, etc.).  I'm think the camper should be a loaf or a split,
preferably a westy.

I need a 300 dpi scan of the camper, in the following orientation:
 - photo taken from right side front quarter view, with camera at
   about 1:30 or 2:00 on the horizonal axis.
 - the bottom 4 inches or so of the tires on the opposite side of
   the vehicle in the original photo are visible.
 - camera height appears to be approximately 3 feet, maybe four
 - distance from the camera to the vehicle is somewhere around 12
   to 18 feet, hard to tell, as a wide angle lens was used.
 - I'd guess that a focal length of about 35mm was used (in 35mm
   film format equivalent --the actual photo was almost certainly
   taken with a medium format camera).
- lighting on the subject is fairly bright, but diffuse.  No
   distinct shadows anywhere, but main light source is from above,
   forward of the vehicle, casting the lower portions of the car
   nearest the camera into shadow.
 - the ad is a two-page spread, with the car being about
   6 1/2&quot; wide by 3 1/4&quot; high (17 x 8 cm).

For those who would like to see the original ad to help in photo selection,
it can be found in the Dec issues of &quot;Outside&quot; (pp 24-25), and Road &amp; Track
(pp. 68-69).

I also have thumbnails of the ad in tiff format (85K + 69K) and can p-mail
copies to you if you wish.

We're trying to move on this pretty fast, so ideally I'd like to have some
images to choose from by Wed at the latest.  If you have some scanned
images you think might work, or if you can scan some, and you'd like to
contribute to this project, p-mail me.  DO NOT EMAIL THE LIST!  Feel free
to send me images; I've got a high bandwidth connection and can handle
email attachments of large files.

Thanks!  (and sorry again for the bandwidth).

Tobin
