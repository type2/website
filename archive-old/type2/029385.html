&gt;                I GOTTA BUNCHA QUESTIONS.... THANKS FOR ANY ANSWERS YOU
&gt; HAVE!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;     1.  is this tough on the engine to have it modified like that? what
&gt; about gas milage?

Dunno.  If they are dual webers, then as long as the fuel/air mix is
correct the van is fine. To check that the fuel/air mix is good take to a
mechanic with an EGA (exhaust gas analyzer) or better to a dyno shop.
Dyno shops (the best know brand is dynojet
(http://www.dynojet_dot_com/lauto.shtml) but there are others out there.

FI buses get ~18-20 MPG, carbs generally get less... 16-19.  below 16 MPG,
something is wrong.  Above 20, something is also wrong! (you are running
lean... VW's can get better milage, but only at the cost of temperature
and longevity!)

&gt;     2.  where can i find or make gaskets for where the pipes to the carb
&gt; attach to the intake manifold..?.(not the boots...got those..)

www.busdepot_dot_com or any VWFLAPS (VW Friendly Local Auto Parts Store)

&gt;     3.  how much and what kind of oil do i put on this aftermarket guaze air
&gt; filter?

KN?  I don't know, but a vist it the K&amp;N web sight will probaably tell
you... http://www.knfilters_dot_com/

&gt;     4.  how do i get the cover off the engine to adjust the valves? (took
&gt; off all the inside screws and it seems to still be attached by screws and
&gt; some part on the other side of the firewall?  maybe its one whole part?)( or
&gt; do i even need to adjust the valves if its running so good with only a
&gt; slight tickety tick tick..)

Hmmm...  Valve covers on a stock engine are held on by spring-steel wire
loops (bails)  to remove the valve cover, you crawl underneath with a
big-ass screwdrive and pop the bail *Down* (it does make a difference :-)
then lift the cover off... if you have nuts and bolts with a cast cover,
then you do have a performance engine of some sort and it is time to go
back to the seller to get a raft of info about what has been done to that
engine.

&gt;     5.  there seems to be something wrong with the tranny... the clutch
&gt; cable has just been replaced but if you try and shift from 1-2 or 2-3 with
&gt; any resonable quickness it grinds a bit ...AND it grinds ALOT if you try to
&gt; downshift while moving... my buddy mentioned syncros going out maybe?

Yeah, that is probably true...  remember that it is 27 years old, and most
cars make it to 10 before they are junked.  Shift slowly and all will be
well, changing the transmission fluid to redline MT-90 (GL-4 *only*!!!
**never** GL-5!!!) might help for a while (like 10-20K miles).

&gt;     6.  the throttle is REALLY touchy.... is there any way to change the
&gt; linkage and make it more smooth? ...i dont need a race car... im only using
&gt; up 1/3 of the travel in my accelerator peddle....

That is part of the &quot;joy&quot; of performance carbs :-) If you hang around a
while, you will find that I am a &quot;stock freak&quot; and believe that stock is
better... opinions on the list differ significantly and I try to respect
that :-)

&gt;     7.  im going to redo the interior myself....i found a webpage explaining
&gt; in detail how to sound proof and insulate a vw van.... has anyone acheived
&gt; happy results soundproofing and isulating thier van? im interested in a
&gt; solid feeling van and improved climate in the hot texas summer.... i was
&gt; thinking of painting with a bright reflective based paint (pearly white on
&gt; top.. champange or the same orange-red on bottom) and trying to find that
&gt; window tint that is almost like a mirror on the outside... do they still
&gt; make that? can i do it myself? i dont care if its illegal.. ill take my
&gt; chances... i must have it.

No idea, sorry.. the Bulley Hewitt page looks like good stuff, but I have
not done it.  I love to listen to the engine :-)  (what can I say, I am a
stock-freak :-)

&gt;     8. does anyone like the VWoA side tents distributed by vw a while ago...
&gt; canvas w/ white duffy... i found one but i want a tent that makes a
&gt; watertight boot to the van... and has a waterproof floor... would i just be
&gt; better off modifying a regular tent?

Depends... there is a guy on the list who sells good modern tents, that
are very nice looking and fit well, but &quot;authentic' is authentic... if you
are going for the restoration, then the original tent is all that will do,
but functionally, any tent can be modified and modern tents are *much
lighter!!!

&gt; THANKS AGAIN!!!!
