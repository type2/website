Subject: 20 mile VW Bus adventure. Only took 3 hours! (Long)

Hello List,

Who says that you have to travel hundreds of miles to
have an adventure in your bus. It only took 20
miles(Over 3 hours) for me. 

I started out today around noon tinkering with my bus.
I pulled the spark plugs (caked in carbon), cleaned
them, adjusted the valves, and did a compression test
on the engine (the engine was cold). Well my
compression readings were 135- 150 on all cylinders
except #4. It was 105. I need the recheck the valves
on that one. Any way, I decided to take it for a test
drive. 

The power had improved since the valve adjustment. I
drove it towards the beach which is around 11 or so
miles from my house. Well, the engine is not as
powerful as I hoped it would be, but I kept going
anyway. Everything was going well except for a rather
loud lifter tap (gotta recheck #4 again). I get as far
as Ft. Fisher Museum which is walking distance from
the shore, and I hear this &quot;clunk&quot; sound. It
immediately feels like the transmission is in neutral.
I coast the bus in the museum parking lot to take a
look. I find that the driver's side axle has
completely separated from the rear wheel. After
inspection, I find that all except 2 bolts had backed
out over time. One of the remaining bolts had broken
at some point in the past and the last bolt broke
today. Luckily, 5 of the six bolts were still in the
cv. One was broken and one had a striped head. I found
an allen key in my tool box that fit and was able to
secure the axle back in place with 4 of the remaining
bolts.

I head off again having no other problems with the cv.
About 5 min. into my trip back home, I notice a
definite loss in power so I pull over. I checked the
oil level and to my surprise I find that it is a quart
too full and the oil is very thin and smells like gas.
I tried to lean out the mixture. Turning the idle
mixture screw did not help much because at some point
my engine ate the accelerator injector tube from my 30
pict Solex.

I head off again towards home, my top speed around 45
mph now. The bus gets slower and slower so I have to
stop once before I reach Snow's Cut bridge and once
after. Heading back over the bridge, my top speed
reaches 23mph.  Some how, I was able to limp it back
home even though I stalled at every stop light and I
had the accelerator floored the entire trip.
 
Well, I have a few things that I need to do which
include installing a new accelerator injector tube,
adjusting the solex, rechecking the valves, changing
the oil, and fixing the rear cv. I also noticed today
that my bus seems to be drinking brake fluid because
the reservoir is empty again and I filled it up not
too long ago. I think that battle if for another day
though. ;) All suggestions, comments, scoldings, etc.
are welcome. I just thought I would share. Have a
great day!

Regards,
David Kelly
