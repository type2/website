Subject: [T2] rust question??


Have you considered moving to Arizona ?
Dave \X/

&gt;Hey,
&gt; i posted this message before, im not sure if anyone saw it or not but, i
&gt;live in new york and i just got my first bus that was just shipped from
&gt;arizona. its rust free and in great shape. since i live in N.Y. theres a
&gt;better chance for rust to form. i dont have a garage, so what do you think i
&gt;can do to prevent rust formation (especially the under carriage)??? i was
&gt;thinking about a bus covor but thats not gonna help the under carriage from
&gt;driving in pretty bad weather conditions with the salty roads and such. if
&gt;anybody lives in the new york area or anyone that knows something can can
&gt;prevent this it would be a HUGE help!/ thanks alot
&gt;-Matt
