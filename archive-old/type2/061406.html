Subject: Cold Start Trouble
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Having trouble with my bus.
Need help......
Tried many things but to no avail.
Bus won't start unless I pour fuel into the top of the carb!!
so far:
Replaced fuel pump
Replaced plugs, leads, contacts, condenser, distributor cap, rotor arm...
Replaced auto choke

The problem is only evident on cold start.  Once used, the bus will start
all day, stopping for up to 6 hours.  After that...more fuel in the top of
the carb.  Outside temperatures here during the day vary from + 15 celcius
down to 0 celcius.  Nothing too outrageous.

Bus is a 1975 bay window, 1600cc no mods, Solex Pict 34 carb.
Anybody got any ideas?

Help
