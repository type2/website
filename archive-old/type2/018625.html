I'm sure &quot;Autoglass&quot; or similar could do it (at a cost) - I had a new
windscreen fitted a few weeks ago by them (on the insurance). For anything
other than the windscreen, I would get glass from a scrappy and fit it
myself (cheaper than the insurance excess). ISTR you're in/near London -
you could do worse than give &quot;Just Kampers&quot; a ring (they do break buses).

Incidentally, having locked myself out of my bus, I can vouch for the
security of the door locks. The AA man couldn't get it unlocked by fishing
inside the door (which works for many cars), so it's no wonder people
resort to breaking the glass. (I ended up 'picking' the lock myself, but
it was one I had removed a lever from when I &quot;re-keyed&quot; my locks to work
&gt;from a common key).

Still, it makes your blood boil when something like that happens.

&gt;Dear all,
&gt;    Isolde was sadly assulted last weekend.   Someone who had obviously seen
&gt;me welding on her decided to jam up the lock (which didn't work) and smash
&gt;the quarter light- in order to get in and steal my MIG welder and some power
&gt;tools.  Yes, I shouldn't have been so stupid as to leave them in there, but
&gt;they were well hidden from view, and the welders just too heavy to lug
&gt;backwards and forwards- please if you are in my situation make the effort to
&gt;take the welder home and not leave it inside the van.
&gt;    The result is, I need a new rig, and a quarter light.  Does anyone know
&gt;where I can get the glass- can someone like autoglass just cut me a new
&gt;piece or will I need to get one s/h- if so can anyone recomend anywhere
&gt;(UK).  Time is running out as my new job starts in 2 weeks.  Thanks for all
&gt;your help.
&gt;
&gt;    cheers
&gt;        Tristan and Isolde
