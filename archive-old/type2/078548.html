Subject: engine leaks oil?

hello all,

is there any way to tell if an engine leaks oil, when
it is out pof the vehicle. i have a 79 engine that i
bought from a &quot;salvageyard&quot; i want to rebuff it and
use it but i want to determine if it leaks oil or not.
can i just pour oil into the crankcase, come back in a
wekk or so and look at the floor beneath? will this
metheod return accurate info?

Matty
