Subject: rear brake backing plate fasteners

Hi Volks,

Our family winter project this winter is a 75 westy named Franklin. 
We're replacing both rear brake backing plates, and the bolt holes are 
very rusty. We had to get down close and squint just to see that the 
holes even had threads.  Or to see that they used to.

Can we simply run a tap through these threads to clean them out, or do 
we need to drill and re-tap one size larger?  If someone can identify 
the thread (M8??) it would be appreciated. And if we replace the bolts, 
do we need a particular hardness or will anything the right size be OK?

Since the brakes are important to everyone's safety I want to be sure 
we do this right.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
