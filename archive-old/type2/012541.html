&gt;They remill the carriers and install larger ball bearings.  Basically new
CV's.

Ah but the question, do they reharden?  Cause if the old ones
are galled through the surface that was flame hardened, if you
don't they aren't going to last.

And even if you do, does the hardness of the ball match the outer
race and does it match the inner race?  This isn't even the case most
often with German new now days.  Lobro seems to run in cycles of
well matched to utter crap every 3-5 years.

Although $99 is certainly appealing, in my estimation it's worth the
time and effort if you will be keeping the thing 100k miles to take the
chance on new ones for $45 each and get quality boots, and do it yourself.
