&gt; Some paranoids may like the clamp more than any T thing else because it can
&gt; be used as an anti theft device. How funny it must be to see a bus stolen
&gt; and 'breaking down' a mile later :)

well the nice thing about the ball valves I have in mine is when parked I
can reach to &quot;just the right spot&quot; and give a 90degree turn and &quot;no gas&quot;
great theft deterrent and since there is one in both the feed and return
lines of my FI bus I can turn one or both for extra backup protection
