Hi!

&quot;John Connolly&quot; &lt;Conman_at_sisna_dot_com&gt; wrote to the List:

&gt; &gt; As I recall, VW offered a diesel version of the Vanagon.
&gt; and it's slower than a 36hp bus (I'm not kidding) too! :-)

Not all of them.  IIRC, the following versions were offered over
time: 1.5, 50 bhp; 1.6, 54 bhp; 1.6 turbo, 70 bhp; 1.9, 65 bhp.
At least the latter two run well -- for a bus ;-)

Conversion of a watercooled vanagon to a Diesel is easier
than that of an aircooled Vanagon or Bay, but everything's 
possible.  Without a Diesel Vanagon parts car, though,
it's an expensive task.

P-mail me for further discussion, as this is off topic
for the List.  Thank God it's Friday!  :-)

Yours,
   Erik.
