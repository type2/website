  Subject: '71 needed

  Due to an oversight on my part, my '71 Campmobile (&quot;Lurch&quot;) has rolled
  down a hill and become intimate with an oak tree.  The front end is
  toast.  Accordi ng to local advice, I have two options: 1) Keep it for
  sentimental reasons and put a new (used) nosepiece on it $$$, 2) Find
  another camper.  The whole family loves our camper, and if it is
  replaced, it would need to be as close a match as possible.  This
  happened before and I was able to upgrade from a '69 to a '71 -- same
  color (white).  I doubt I can be that lucky again.  I'm a-lookin'

Don't give up yet!  If your steering, pedals, and instrumentation are still
working and all that has happened is that the tin on the nosepiece is
smashed in, then your bus may live to see another day.

Last October I wasn't paying attention and rearended a stopped car (first
car-to-car accident that was my fault in 25 years of driving).  Crushed in
the front and my insurance company totaled it.  First thought was to take
the money and put it as a down payment for a newer car than I realized
that I would feel naked in anything else.  So I....


....removed all the non-essential under dash stuff (heater tubes,
windshield washer stuff, that flimsy cardboard coverings

....took a couple of floor jacks and some odd bits and pieces of lumber and
using the seat humps as a brace, pushed out the front tin into an
approximation of the correct shape; doesn't have to be perfect by any means
(you'd be surprised, and disturbed, how easy it is to reshape the front end
tin)

....paid special attention to making sure that the pedal holes (now since
shifted) didn't bind on the gas and brake pedals

....adjusted the link to the brake booster servo so that there was
sufficient freeplay in the universal joint (VERY important; can result in
brakes coming on at high rpms)

....replaced broken lights and lenses and then readjusted as needed

....put in metal dryer vent tube from floor to defroster vent

....created an underdash covering using stolen United Airlines blankets
(screws at just under the dash, into the old cover screw points, and at the
floor).

....sprayed some Rustoleum on any of the exposed metal on the nosepeice

....and paid RMMW $85 for a nose bra and slapped the sucker on.


Bingo.  Back in service and everyone is happy.



If this isn't possible, keep your current one for a while and buy a
replacement.  Then strip your old one down to the wheels just enough to let
to roll.  Fill zillions of boxes with everything you can unscrew including
handles, covers, ashtrays, headlights, the engine, all the instruments, the
windshield wiper motor, every piece of wire, yadda yadda yadda.  Then have
the hulk hauled off.  As time progresses, your &quot;new&quot; bus will be filled
with replacement parts from the old one and if the most visible stuff like
curtains go in first, your family will have an easy transition.  It worked
for me and lots of my friends never noticed that I replaced a bus a few
years ago (when I forgot to set the parking brake and it too rolled down a
hill; only it hit a wall, flipped over, a blocked a no-exit cul-de-sac for
three hours).  Eventually the spirit of Lurch will take over the new bus
like some sort of bad science fiction thriller.


Good luck.  I can understand your pain.
