And I need the tube that this cap goes onto and down into the tank.  It is
ribbed on botton so that it just pulls out of the tank.

 I need your help.  The cap for the water tank in our 71 Westy broke, and
I'm
 in need of another cap.  If anyone has a spare they are willing to part
 with, or knows where I can get one, please let me know.
