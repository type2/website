As it turns out the little tray in the picture I had was something John
Leale added from another ice box. I still don't know what the lower slots
are for, but it was suggested that the upper slots are there to accomodate
different size ice blocks  :)

If anybody knows what the lower slots are for let me know.

It was also suggested that I use an old windshield curtain to sew side
curtains up so if anybody has an extra one, especially ones with holes or a
bad stain, I maybe could salvage some of it.

Thanks for the input!

&gt; Ok   In my bus (and in the picture on the link I attached) there is a slot
&gt; at the bottom of the fridge for something to slide in to. On the super
&gt; original 72 in my link (which is on VWplanet classifieds right now
&gt; www.thesamba_dot_com ) there IS a big tray there as if a vegetable crisper or
&gt; something. http://www.72camper_dot_com/3936.jpg
&gt; If this tray is not original what are the slots for? A rack? It sure looks
&gt; original.
&gt; I do have the metal basket at the top and a drip tray that has a tube that
&gt; goes to the grey water tube, whick also shows up in the above link.
&gt; There are actually a bunch of slots in my fridge and it still has the
&gt; Campmobile sticker on it so I know its original. Any help is appreciatted
&gt; and I still want the tray if its original or whatever was!!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again,
