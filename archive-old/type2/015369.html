&gt;&gt; They seem to think they can build just about everything. I have recently
&gt;&gt; seen two repeat AVP long blocks fail for a Mercruiser engine from them.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I deal with AVP regularly and sell their engines.  They're a VW specialist,
&gt;and specifically a VW bus engine specalist.  I think you're confusing them
&gt;with somebody else.
&gt;

Can't say it's not possible. I can review the case and get back with
correction or confirmation.
