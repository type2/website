From what I could gather,  in speaking with the owner/seller. This show bus
is somewhat of a &quot;modified freak&quot;  lowered, and tricked out completely.  I
doubt if you would ever see it at a campout.....

&gt; i agree, a showpiece car is nice to look at, but i
&gt; tend to like the advice my uncle gave me once.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;its just no fun to own it if you don't put itsideways
&gt; once in a while.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; he was speaking more on the sports car side so just
&gt; insert, camp, take a trip in etc., and you get
&gt; mydrift.  have a great wekend!
