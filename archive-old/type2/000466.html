For the past twelve years I've been running my own (computer-) company. I
recognise the problems that Ron wrote about. It's probably the same in most
businesses. If Ron's suppliers tell him things are on the way (when they are
not) he will be giving incorrect information to his customers. Still, in the
end Ron is responsible and if his customers are not satisfied (for whatever
reason) he will suffer. I'm convinced he knows that. I'm also convinced he
is honest and does not willingly put people in this situation.

In order to keep our cars on the road we need people like Ron who try to
combine business and hobby. So don't write off The Bus Depot right away. I
don't think this does justice on his part.

And I still think you cannot blame him for not making it to a show two days
later. Sure it's annoying but with cars this age if you want guarantees you
need to order parts well in advance as delays can and WILL happen.
