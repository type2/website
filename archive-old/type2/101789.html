Subject: Re: [T2] Just got a no seatbelt ticket... has there been a
  study done saying that belts in a bus would do nothing to prevent
  injury?

     There is a reason seat belts are in cars man, they really do help.  I 
have allot of friends who are EMT's and Parameds, and they unanimously agree 
that there are MANY more fatalities in cars where seatbelts aren't worn, 
regardless of car type or seat belt type.  We all know the cars we drive are 
not equipped with all the modern safety equipment so we are accepting a 
certain amount of extra risk every time we drive (which I think as a 
community we usually make up for with our lower speeds and safer driving 
habits), but why on earth would anyone want to add to that risk?  If you're 
seat belts aren't adequate, I would strongly recommend getting better belts, 
not just deciding not to wear any belts at all.
     Anyway, that's just my opinion, so I'm sure you'll do whatever you want 
anyway and that's really none of my business but you did ask about seat 
belts.  At least in this case you'll be killing nobody but yourself, and 
that is pretty much natural selection (no offense intend, but it's the truth 
dude).  I would like to remind you though that there are probably other 
people who would care allot more than me (got a wife, kids, a mother?), and 
PLEASE don't pass this behavior on to your kids if you have any.

Thanks,
