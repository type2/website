Subject: 911 engine swaps in UK.

Hi,
     I phoned &quot;VW/Porsche extreme&quot; in Bournemouth this afternoon looking for info on doing a 911 conversion in the UK. They said they'd had a call from someone else a few weeks ago asking the same thing: was this a listee, perchance? Maybe Alistair Brown?

 If so, or in any case, does anyone have any info on UK conversions? I know Lee Griffiths (you still here, Lee?) has a friend with a 911/Splitty, but it sounds like a major custom project. Andy Erskine said a while back that he'd seen one and that maybe &quot;WASP&quot; did this work. Who are WASP?
 I rang GBE engineering in Nantwich- they don't do 911 adapters and couldn't suggest anyone who did.

 I'd like to talk to anyone who's done this in the UK/Europe before I try and do it on my own with parts from the US.

Thanks for any info.

Cheers,
         W.
