Subject: Re: [T2] Eberspacher BN4 heater pics...

 My install is going a bit longer than I had wanted, but I am learning along the way.  Most of the time was
spent trying calculate exactly where I wanted to drill a hold in the floor for the exhaust.  A bit nerve
racking.  I cut it in the wrong spot the first time anyway.  I havn't been able to come across many descent
quality pics of these units, so I took some preliminary
shots.  Later I'll add shots of the install process and hopefully provide somewhat of a relevant write up on
it.  For now though,

Probably too late now but......  I put the VW heater book up here:
http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/ebersp.html

It has directions and diagrams for installing the heaters......
