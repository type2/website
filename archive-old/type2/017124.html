Subject: Rear Door Hinge....springs

Recap:
D.P.O. buggered up the rear door (hatch?) hinges, and the past two years have
seen me wearing my motorcycle helmet anytime I have had to go under it. Found a
decent replacement set, and pulled them out intact. Would like to replace the
broken ones with the good ones.

How does one go about this?

I've searched the archives and it appears I'm in uncharted waters....

I'll figure it out, taking lots of pictures along the way, and post a proceedure
somewhere.
