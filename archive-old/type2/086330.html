Subject: '78 Westy

I bought a 'Low Mileage' 72 standard bus a couple of years ago, and it was
like raising something from the dead. It's plenty of work to bring these
back, the lower the mileage the more work involved, in my opinion. Mine had
75k original on it and had been mostly garaged but flooded once and not
driven since 1986. As was documented on this site, the drivetrain fell apart
like clay and had to be totally replaced, not to mention the brake system
and still working on the electrical and body ....so low mileage has no
benefit except in the condition of the drivers seat.
just my opinion
