Hello Volks,

Last weekend I saw an ex-Bundespost highroof, that one will probably go to
Africa.
I just called a car import-export firm who has a slidingroof, slide-window,
audi-engined Baywindow for sale.
It's ment to be exported to Africa. Guess right now, it's ment to be saved
by me...

Can anybody tell me if the 'export-syndrom' is something Dutch, or do
simply ALL buses go to Africa?
(In that case, I'd like to go to Africa to check out option-code plates!)

And if so, shouldn't we have more African members... ?
