Subject: Crankcase Breather problems in 73 bus

When I bought my bus, the carb in it was not doing to well (Weber
progressive single carb conversion). I just installed a new Weber in it and
it runs great now. I think the problem was that the crankcase breather had a
hose that connected to the underside of the AC assembly and there was a lot
of oil inside the air cleaner that I think ended up ruining the old carb. I
mean, there was more than just a film of oil inside the AC unit, in the
edges, it was all pooled up and the choke plate closest to the breather tube
was almost all black. I had also replaced all the intake manifold seals and
the intake port on the cylinder that was closest to the breather tube was
also black inside but all the others were a nice bright metal color.

Anyways, I don't want this to happen to my new carb so I didn't connect the
breather tube back up to the AC unit. I just left it hanging loose (pointed
up). I don't want it squirting oil all over my engine either, but I'm afraid
to block off the tube because I don't want air pressure to build up in the
crankcase. What should I do with the tube?

Thanks!
