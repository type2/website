I had an old cable go bad and was unable to feed the new one through. I
used the old cable as a pull wire to try to get the new one through and it
got stuck. permastuck.
I ended up having to cut approx the last foot off of the cable tube, past
the last weld. What I think happened is that the tube was corroded at the
weld or maybe the weld had intruded into the tube somewhat and caused a
partial blockage. I extended the end of the tube with a length of fuel
hose past the trannt and its been funtional for a few years like that.
