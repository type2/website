&gt;A.  Is the SR17X the so-called &quot;automatic&quot; starter, that's self-supporting 
&gt;without a bushing?

Yes. This is also the correct starter for the Porsche 911/912. Same starter 
as well as the 928 EXCEPT the 928 rotates the opposite direction, so 
carries a different no. but the case and solenoid and guts are the same. A 
VERY robust starter, as would be expected of anything approved by Porsche.


&gt;B.  Will this starter fit a stock 1970 bell housing, 1600SP case, etc.?

I'm not sure. Don't have the book here at home to verify.


&gt;C.  Related question...  I'm still running the factory original generator 
&gt;and regulator.  The generator is in good shape, and has been rebuilt a 
&gt;couple of times.  Is a new or Bosch-rebuilt generator still available?

Yes.
