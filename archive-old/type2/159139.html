Subject: Re: [T2]Temp Roof

Last year I drove my High top bus with out the top from Chicago to Kelly 
Browns Shop in NC and back.

I had stripped the interior and all of the windows except the windshield 
and the front door windows.

Got lots of funny looks but did not have much of an issue with wind and 
driving.  As for the rain it was all behind me, though that might not 
work for you.

Removing the rear hatch should be enough to keep things smooth and plan 
for good weather.

Even got pulled over by someone asking if I wanted to by another bus.
