Normally, I'd be all for this technique, but after seeing what my roller
bearing race looked like after it ran with a loose axle nut I'd want to
try a puller first.  The spacer, nut, and drum hold the bearing races in
proper position within the hub.  If you do go this way, back the nut off
one turn so that things will be relatively in the correct place.  Don't
drive it this way more than a short distance.
