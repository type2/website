Detmar is a company specializing in marine items.  They may have a website,
but it's a common line carried by lots of marine supplies.

There are metal or synthetic housing squirrel cage bilge blowers, and
they're available in various sizes, configurations, and mounting
arrangements.  They have relatively high outputs for their sizes, and in my
experience are also quieter than the plastic-bodied inline blowers.

The squirrel cage type would be my first choice for a heat booster in a bus.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I found this very interesting and sounds like a deal compared to J.C.
Whitney.  I found a web site selling the Attwood Turbo fans for $17.95.
Thanks.  I do have on question.  I can't find any information on the Detmar.
Is it a product of Attwood?  Is that the manufacturer name? I'd like to live
in a heated wind tunnel.  &lt;&lt;
