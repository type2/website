Subject: [T2] some bad AP3 cams out there


&gt; I had a engine built by a local shop. we installed a AP3 cam. it went flat
&gt; and the grit distroyed all the bearings and the crank in 900 miles even
with
&gt; 3 oil changes. the owner has had all three of the engines he built with
his
&gt; last shipment of 5 cams(he still has 2) come back. mine ground the crank
so
&gt; bad it started leaking around the pully. he has been using these cams
since
&gt; the early 80's with no bad results. he recieved the bad 5 early last
year.he
&gt; is waiting to hear from his supplier. he is gonna build me another one
with
&gt; a engle 100 or scat cam. hope this info helps someone else.

AP cams are made in Brazil by Resolit.
Cams require the proper surface hardening, nitriding,
matching lifter hardness, correct valve spring pressure,
proper break-in procedure,etc.
It's all voodoo. It can still go flat. Just Ask Murphy.
