Subject: [T2] Cab window help needed...

Now I'm stuck. Help!

I'm working on a 72 Riviera cab door, trying to get the dent out of the
bottom (slide hammer in the reflector screw holes does wonders for that
malfunction, once you get all the Bondo off) and the edge straightened out
(vise-grip welding clamp works here) and now need to take the window and
regulator off for ease of painting and scraper replacement.

Following the instructions in Bentley, that window is still firmly in place.
Insert your favorite dirty words here.

Are there any little tricks I'm overlooking? Thanks.
