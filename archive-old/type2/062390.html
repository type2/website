&gt; &gt; The socket on your dash is a 12v outlet.  The corresponding plug is
&gt; availiable
&gt; &gt; at bmw motorcycle dealers, as they use it for electric vests.
&gt; 
&gt; Electric vests?  Like battery powered socks?
&gt; My fiance would be VERY interested in that!

I've already thought about that.  Whin I was in my pre-syncre days, I
found elkectric socks at the Fleet Farm (large farm type wal mart) They
ran on 9v, But I'm sure they could be adapted to run on 12v through the
plug
