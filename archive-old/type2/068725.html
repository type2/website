&gt; &gt;The fan motor is frozen (Like H Steven said) but, not wholly so it turns,
&gt; &gt;but sticks and backs up and blows the fuse right away.  Need new motor.
&gt; 

NO, NO this motor may not be dead, this will happen sometimes but
sometimes can be ressurected.  Here's what to do, take it out and 
observe that the motor comes apart by removeing these 2 little screws 
that hold tabs that lock into the case of the motor.  Take it all apart, 
clean and lube the bearings on the shaft then do this.  You must 
reassemble it running, in fact simply loosening the screws then running 
it while tightening may be enough.  Attach a 12 VDC power supply (car 
battery using jumper cables or a battery charger) directly to the fan 
motor with everything loosened up and the fan side secured in a vice or 
like.  10 to 1 it will run now.  Tighten down the screws alternately 
while it is running and likely it will still run.  Easy trick might save 
you some money.  The 78's and others I have owned were &quot;bound up&quot; but
this saved them.
