Betreff: [T2] Here we go again: Glowing red light


Hey Auker,
I think your problem is not that strange.
An old mechanical DC-generator - regulator is switching D+ between Batterie
+ and Chassis (ground).
The bulb ist powered, by switched Batterie + and then fed back
to the regulator where it is switched to ground ( low generator voltage),
light on, or batterie + (high generator  voltage), light off because of no
delta Voltage on bulb.

I think you have a more powerful  AC-alternator with elctronical regulator.
It nearly works the same, but - there is no hard switching between + and
gnd, it's done the electronic way.
The bulb is off, when it is powered by 12 V via the ignition switch on one
side and 0V or 12 V via the regulator on the other side.
If your igition switch, the cable that supplies it and/or all the contacts
on that way are a little corroded, you'll have (with engine running)
13,2 V on the regulators side and only 11 or 12 V on the ignition-switched
side. So the delta of  rough 2 V make the bulb glowing.

It also can be the contacts that lead to the regulator, the bulb is always
glowing when there is a voltage delta between their contacts.
But I'm quite sure, it's the ignition-contact-plate or the fuse contacts,
that makes your problem. When you turn on the turn signals and/or brake
light, the current through the ignition switch increases, with a constant
(too high) resistance it results in a higher voltage loss BEHIND the
igintion switch. And that's the reson, why your bulb is glowing only with
this additional loads.

I know this problem since more than 20 years from my 6V split-Bus, it does
not mean that the battery is not properly loaded, it is directly connected
to the generator/alternator. But it abnerves.
I've had a bad Iginiton switch in another '77 last year, it's a lot of work
to change it.

Best wishes to find the bad contacts,

Hi Volks,

The subject line tells all.  I have read all the archives and gotten
some great info but...
I am stumped.  The red light in my '70 westy used to glow all the time
at night with the lights on. I replaced the generator with a Super 75
by Kymco and deleted the possibilities of a faulty generator and
regulator.  Now the light only glows when the turn signals, and brakes
are applied.  My guess is a bad ground, but I am a clueless math
teacher.  What do you all think?  Thanks

Auker
