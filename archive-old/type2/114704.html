&gt;i have what i believe to be something like a sway bar,
&gt;i dont know if this is factory or aftermarket..

Rear means aftermarket.

&gt;my concern is that the drivers side apparently isnt
&gt;hooked up, and there is no bracket for it..
&gt;
&gt;is anyone faintly familar with what im trying to
&gt;describe?

It's not doing much good if it isn't attached to both sides.

Can you take a photo?
