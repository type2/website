Subject: [T2] Alternator/fan tinware Q


&gt; Hey y'all
&gt; Whilst spending time not at work due to illness, I decided it was time to
&gt; finish the Sp doghouse project, in between bouts with the nasty drugs I
was
&gt; given.  Before I just put the new fan on the hub, is there a difference in
&gt; the tinware between fan and alternator?  I don't recall a difference but
&gt; right now my mind's not exactly at it's sharpest...
&gt;

Well, Dave, fujoyek fjflkr  vuifcud cidopminkc pokllsc fkn opypjj  mjgmffr
There is a difference - 38 amp generator tin is special.
You need 30 amp generator tin for your alternator conversion.
In addition, you will need to hotlik bnp flersch yuivyoper tektokf.
I hope this helps:)
Get well soon.
