Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild just one cylinder? Cam? Bigger valves?

Richard and that Subaru guy :-) have already explained the decrease in 
low-end torque because of bigger valves.  The reason I said it might 
make up for it on the top end is because at higher RPMs the bigger 
valves generally become an advantage and produce more torque (and more 
torque equals more horsepower).

I said &quot;might&quot; because the rpm at which the bigger valves switch from 
disadvantage to advantage might be 3K or it might be 5K (useful vs. 
useless, respectively).
