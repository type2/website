Subject: Re: seat belts

Remember that most seat belt bolts are inch, not metric  7/16-20 size
(until very recently) and please don't use hardware store bolts for
these!

If anyone needs Seat Belt Bolts, I can likely supply proper bolts for the
postage reimbursement only - P-Mail me.  I have a Vanagon, so I am not
sure of the style (shoulder or not, length) used on the Bay window
campers.

Happy trails,
John
