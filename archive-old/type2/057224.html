critical is
&gt; it to put the cut out in the same position?  Do these cutouts serve a
&gt; specific function?

What these cutouts do is cause the pad to have less pressure on its
leading edge, which probably reduces squealing.  The cutout is placed
on the downward pointing side of the piston with the caliper in its
installed position.

There is a retaining plate with two projections that goes between the
piston and the shoe.  The projections keep the piston in the proper
orientation,  If the plate is installed incorrectly, the first brake
application will flatten the projections, rendering the plate useless.
 Luckily, the projections can just be bent back out again.
