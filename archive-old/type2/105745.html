Subject: Re: [T2] RE: rain gutter repair

It all depends where the bus is from.  My bus has a very solid body but 
over 60 holes, had - now repaired - in the roof.  WHY, because this is 
how all vehicles rust here in the islands.  Not so where I grew up, New 
England, but that's someone else's headache.

&gt;Hey, Tom.  I would tend to agree, but this bus is relatively solid except
&gt;for the gutters (it sat with the drain holes blocked)  But, I am hard-headed
&gt;(and cheap) and will find a way to fix it.
