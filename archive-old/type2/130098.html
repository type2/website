&gt;These results are consistent with what I expected. And yes, it's possible

Well, I'm not sure that I cross threaded, I can't even start threading the 
spark plug and I heard a sound of loose metal falling around the entry of 
the chamber.  Now my compression tester is stuck in the chamber somehow (it 
didn't screw in, it just sort of fell in).  It has a ton of play but I 
can't get it out.

So, the engine will come out once again.  And it looks like a new head is 
in order.  The question is should I replace both heads, or just get another 
one from MOFOCO.
