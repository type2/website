&gt;  I'm trying to set up a specialized mapping service for our busses.
&gt; Generally speaking, hills are bad, and most of us here prefer the
&gt; scenic route anyways.  So if you have a favorite route you'd like to
&gt; share with the rest of us Busheads, please send them my way.  More


I'd love something like this.  I'm *always* looking for the &quot;off the 
beaten path&quot; road that are those hidden jems.  Especially when there's a 
neat spot to stop and heat up some tea and enjoy the scenery ;)
