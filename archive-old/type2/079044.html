Subject: Re: [T2] type 1 into a 73

Are you sure the clutch disk splines are the same and properly aligned
with the pilot bearing.
You may have crushed the edge of the main shaft pilot bearing (not un
common when you use force).

&gt; Ok, I have my friend's 73 bus in the driveway. He took the 1700 out 
&gt; and
&gt; is tryiiing to put a type 1 engine into it.  We have everything 
&gt; lined up
&gt; but cant get the engine all the way on to the tranny.
&gt; What are we missing?
&gt; 
&gt; the engine came out of a 71 bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Ed
