How is yours different.  Are you guys using a different kind of O2

&gt; &quot;normal&quot; operation with the cheaper units often includes the meter pegging
&gt; to full rich or full lean, even when the engine is operating normally at a
&gt; good A/F ratio. Another one is where the meter takes FOREVER to respond to
&gt; O2 levels. These are both very common with the cheaper kits, so do your
&gt; homework.
