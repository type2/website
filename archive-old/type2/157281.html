Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ?(AnswerNemo)

You're right about under-body tire mounts being a pain
to access. As it was, the only place I could mount it
was behind the front left wheel and because it
wouldn't fit between the frame rails or between the
frame and body edge, I had to mount it below the rail
which gave me about 4&quot; of ground clearance! I could
live with that near an axle centerline, but amidships
is just too vulnerable. It now resides in the
passenger footwell, jammed against the dashboard. The
passenger seat is long gone - that is my pantry now!

&gt; I can say that the worst thing in the world is
&gt; having to jack up the vehicle to get the flat off
&gt; the ground, plus jack up the vehicle in the
&gt; location of one of those darn under body mounts,
&gt; and then crawl under the #&amp;%$!#^* truck to get
&gt; the darn spare.  Never would I purposefully add
&gt; this feature to any vehicle.
