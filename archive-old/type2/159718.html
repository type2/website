Subject: Re: [T2] Turbobus update

Yes, I'm thinking about it.  My current daily driver is a '91 Mercedes 
300D and I am running that on a vegetable oil blend.  Works very well 
but I have heard mixed results with the VW engine so I am going to 
proceed cautiously.  I will probably not try VO in it for quite a while, 
at least not until I have a spare injection pump to fall back on.  :-)
