Subject: Tow Dolly Trip was Successful!!!

Hi Volks,

Just thought I'd let y'all know we made it back to Toronto safe and sound
with Matt's 79 Van.

It looked better than I dared hope to expect from a freebie, and followed us
home on the tow dolly without a whimper. The amazement factor went even
higher when *all* of the 14 allen bolts holding the axles came out without
any serious problems. If you've ever seen a 10 year old Ontario car you'll
understand that up here, that just doesn't happen. They strip or they shear
off, and you're guaranteed at least 4 skinned knuckles. I still have fully
intact skin on both hands. Crossing the border was a piece of cake, the duty
was extremely reasonable and there wasn't even a line-up at the counter.

Matt was an excellent and gracious host/tour guide in the all-too-short time
we were there, and my wife Colleen and I had a great time talking buses,
computers and taking in the outlet malls of Maine and New Hampshire.  We had
a great time.

I've processed and uploaded the pics from the digital camera, there are a
few shots of the van and trailer online here:

Also, many thanks to Denmeister for the moral support and the comfort of
knowing help was just a phone-call away if we needed it. Thanks also to the
many other listmembers who sent their comments, stories and advice.

P.S. Matt's Karma balance is *way* up there, IMHO.  THANKS MATT!!

Did I mention we had a great time?
