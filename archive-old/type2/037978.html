Well, it's correct two times a day!

First, make sure that it is getting power.  The best clocks won't work
unless they get some juice.  Measure the voltage across the terminals.

Second, clean it up.  Take off the housing and carefully clean it.  If it
is of the design where a mainspring is wound periodically by the closing
of electrical contacts, carefully clean the contacts.

These two steps will clean up most mechanical clocks.  If you have a
quartz clock, you need a specialist!
