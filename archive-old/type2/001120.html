I am considering buying a exhaust analyzer.  There is one at JC Whitney MDL
#12ZX5486B that I am thinking about.  Anybody have any experience with this
or any other consumer model?  Are they accurate?  It sure would seem to save
me some money.  About the only reason I go to mechanics is for the CO
adjustment.  This model is also a ignition/battery tester.  Thanks.
