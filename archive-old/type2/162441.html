&gt; Oh...I looked at my Bus today. It was pretty.

I looked at mine today and it gave me the razzberries... I've spent the
past two weeks taking the roof down to bare metal and zinc primer, then
primer then undercoating.  (will wait til I have a good day for the gloss
white)  just as I was doing the very back I found a couple of pin holes so
I guess it is out with the welder and try not to burn it up.

but it has been running rough intermittently and I decided to stare at the
engine this morning,  was tightening this and that, turned the engine off
for something and then it would not restart...?????  moved this and that
and it restarted??? huh.  so with the engine running I started moving all
the wires and thinngs around, nada   took the tank of acetylene and let
some out at all the vaccum connections, nada.  pulled spark plug wires
nada.  when it is running it runs nice, but.

still haven't figured out what gives.... I hate intermittent stuff...and
the bus laughs on.!!!!

now there is a good sized crack in the #1 exhaust pipe right before the
muffler that I need to weld up but that isn't intermittent.

oh it is a 78 auto tranny with Pertronix and a 72-74 exhaust system
otherwise stock.


mumble mumble mumble.
