&gt; &gt; they patch you up.)

&gt; Assuming you survive this, let me tell you *how* they patch you up. (This is
&gt; so you get scared enough to not use gasoline for anything but its intended

&gt; Nurse Ratched is going to dip that Scotch-Brite pad into the alcohol and
&gt; scrub the burnt skin off you. Now you know what the earplugs are for.

&gt; The film the Army Burn Institute made of this procedure (they don't have the
&gt; screams on there) was one of our safety NCO's favorites.

I was an Army medic during the war and that film had to be edited to
eliminate some of the more gruesome sections...!

as they say, been there did that, don't want it done to me!

let's be carefull!
