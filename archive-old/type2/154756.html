Subject: Re: [T2] Interior heat should be independent of the thermostat
  ??

I am not saying that I would be stopping the airflow through the system, I just want to dump it in a less restrictive way farther from the engine and closer to my dash, the airflow through the heat exchangers should improve actually.

I could rig up something with much less feet of cable if the heater control box was closer to my dash.

As for allowing heat to flow out of the exchangers when the heater is off I could open the tube to my rear heat vent and let it pour out underneath the bus, all it needs is to divert the heat so it is not coming inside, right?

&gt; &gt; What if I replaced my heat control boxes with smooth straight pipes and 
&gt; controlled my heat as close to my dash as possible with one giant heat control 
&gt; box???? 
&gt; 
&gt; You'd melt down the HE's. They're designed to have air flowing through 
&gt; them whenever the engine's running. The control boxes just control 
&gt; where it goes. Either to the cabin or dumped outside.
