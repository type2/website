Subject: mark it b4 dismantling the torsion.....

please, please, please, please.....mark the torsion arms with a cold chisel.
this way you can re-assemble them in a relatively short period of time. 
otherwise you will be real good with a protractor and ruler after you are
done if you didnt mark them (the rear torsion arms) b4 taking it all apart. 


a friend of mine...from the vintage list bought a super beetle that had been
*lowered* in the rear.  it took days of measuring, assembling then lowering
the car back onto the tires.  then measuring again,  dis-assembling and
doing it all over again.....to this day it still feels a little *squirrely*
in the back.  just mark them...(unless you are feeling the gods of fate will
bless you, and lead you to install it correctly the first time)...get a
chisel, hammer, and pound.  done.


ok..my rant is over.
