Subject: Driving Bus to Washington next week! 3.44 + .82 going in this wee
	kend...

Howdy Volks on the type2 list  -- my transaxle stuff is splitty specific
(reduxtion boxes and all), but my offer to deliver things and have beer is
good for any bus owner :)  Splitty, Loaf or otherwise.  Anyway...

Lots and lots going on.  I've been working way too many hours the last few
months and have not done much with my bus since the last drive down to
Arizona at the start of December.  I've gone home to Seattle twice since
then, but flew out of Vegas (which isn't exactly easy given that Lake Havasu
is still 3 hours away (one-way) from Vegas).

BUT NOT GOING AIRPLANE THIS TIME... I'm driving my 1967 Westy!

This next trip, schedule for departure on Wednesday (7 days from now) I am
driving the 1350 miles to Seattle spending about 12 days there then driving
1350 back here to Arizona.  So if anyone needs any thing delivered TO
WASHINGTON, please let me know (I'm pretty full on the return trip).  I know
someone in Colorado wanted me to deliver something, but I'm likely going to
go the I5 route again (Sacramento instead of the Salt Lake City route)...
but maybe if the weather is good I'll venture it... but I'd rather stick to
known mountain passes (Oregon)...

I'm also proud to announce that Tristan and I are getting Married March 25th
in Las Vegas!

Anyway, putting the Todd Hill 3.44 R&amp;P with .82 4th transmission in this
weekend.  Fixing some engine seal and engine tin problems too.  I'll have my
GPS and tach working for that long (driving solo) 1350 mile trip next week
and I'm sure you hear all about how the 3.44 works compared to my currently
stock transaxle.

I know some of you wonder what the heck I've been doing down here for 3
solid months in Arizona... what I'll say is that the grand opening of the
new on-line catalog will happen before my marriage!  We are starting
testing/preview really soon.  Keep your eyes on http://www.OldVolks_dot_com/ ...

Thanks to all.  Anyone in Sacramento, Eugene, Grants Pass, Portland,
elsewhere? want to get together for a beer latter half of next week?

P.S.  I don't think I've seen any mention on the list of the April VW Trends
coverage of Rancho's new bus transaxle .77 4th and 3.88 R&amp;P combo... first I
have ever seen outside-our-list references to a .77 4th in a bus.
