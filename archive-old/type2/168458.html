Subject: Re: Megasquirt + Lambda?

Don, it is also possible to run MS without benefit of any O2 sensor, then you futz with the fuel map endlessly and do a lot of spark plug reading :-)

I just installed the second barometric sensor in mine (for real-time auto adjustment) but I am still putting the engine together from the dropped valve seat so no feedback on that one yet.  Last year I went from 3500' here over the rockies to Vancouver in a day.  I use the latest MSII variety.

Mike, I am running an MSD ignition off of the original hall-effect distributor and taking the tach signal from that.  It is rock solid, a bonus feature when switching to MSD. I picked up a used unit for $100.  If you are making a trigger wheel, make 2 - one for me!!  Distributorless ignition is on my evolutionary timeline somewhere.  I just saw a system installed on a Volvo B18 in a P1800 race car - very cool.
