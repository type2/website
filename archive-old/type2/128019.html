&gt;&gt;I traded my 82 Westy for a 71 Westy,&lt;&lt; 

Sounds like a good move to me ;^)

&gt;&gt;I don't have a tiitle, it was a Georgia bus.&lt;&lt; 

Isn't Georgia one of those states where they do not
give titles for old cars? If so, all you need is a
notarized bill of sale from the previous owner and
your home state must accept it...

&gt; Here's what I'm currently looking for, the only
&gt; things I really want new are 
&gt; the cables.&lt;&lt;

I am pretty sure i have the sliding door handle, and a
new accelerator cable that you can have for the price
of postage. I'll have to check when I get home, email
me later...
Peace, John Baker
