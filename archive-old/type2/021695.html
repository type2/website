Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot

Hmmm,
I kind of agree with Damon on this one. No one is really slagging the Bus Depot.
It is important that we discuss our supplier experiences. I, for one, would
never have thought of going to either brokenbus_dot_com, or JB Heater Source if it
wasn't for these conversations.
However I disagree about the second half of Damon's message. I don't mind
welding tips, or conflicting mechanical fixes.
An if your concern is that a supplier is be slagged, remember, its for a reason.
If bus depot doesn't maintain thier site, and they read on this mailing list
that people are losing faith they may spring into action and do something about
it.

&gt; Why? I actually think reading about other's experience with suppliers is one
&gt; of the most useful things I have seen on your list.  Sure beats reading
&gt; conflicting mechanical fixes or that someone bought a welder.  But don't
&gt; worry, list Nazi - I am unsubscribing.

&gt; &gt;Yes.  Don't order anything online. They list lots of items. However, in
&gt; &gt;almost every case when I have placed an order a Bus Depot employee calls to
&gt; &gt;tell me half the item is out of stock.  I have had several items on
&gt; &gt;back-order for months.  I have had much better luck with Bus Boys (they got
&gt; &gt;a rebuilt '68 bus steering bos to my mechanic in one day - they are in
&gt; &gt;Calif.  we are in Maryland).  Rocky Mountain is also very prompt.
