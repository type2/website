&gt;For all you US owners Kuhmo makes a nice 185R14C but it
&gt;is not available in Canada (Probably costs about $35-65
&gt;USD, tirerack at $55). At first they quoted these to me
&gt;at 75 $CDN but then said they couldn't get em.  If you
&gt;need tires look em up, Id be interested to hear how it
&gt;went for you. Kuhmos are korean and supposed to be very
&gt;tough!

I can attest to the fact that Kumho tires are of good quality.  I have not 
used the 185R15 tire on my bus (it's just too narrow for me, please no 
flames) but I have Kumhos on my Mustang now after hearing my friends rave 
about them.  They handle and wear very well.  I've also used their DOT 
legal roadrace tires with good results.  I would not hesitate to recommend 
Kumhos to anyone.
