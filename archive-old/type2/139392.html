&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; I just checked my gas mileage in my 71 bus, for the third time since 
&gt; the end
&gt; of October and have noticed that my gas mileage aint what it should 
&gt; be. I
&gt; normally get somewhere between 19 to 23 mpg, now its about 12 to 15 
&gt; mpg.
&gt;

Same here in Oklahoma, getting 14 mpg.  I've heard producers gradually 
start the &quot;winter&quot; blend gasoline in October, working to full &quot;winter&quot; 
strength by January.  Producers  gradually go back to summer blend 
starting in March.  By June, gasoline is a full &quot;summer&quot; blend.  It 
could be, however, the cooler temperatures affecting fuel mileage.  My 
2 cents worth!
