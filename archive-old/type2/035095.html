Subject: 68-71 generator setup tip

Hot tip: You can make your upright generator go straight in and out by
not using the two nuts to attach it to the backing plate.  I always do
this to my buses and can change the generators thereafter in 15 minutes
no problem.
This saves pulling the engine to do the correct procedure, and it sure
saves the horrible damage that can be done by paid wranglers trying to
wrench the thing out without pulling the engine.

Look carefully at the setup next time you do it and you can figure this
out for yourself, the only drawback is that you may need to be more
particular setting up the spacer washers for the fan and the vertical
alignment of the fan housing because your clearance between fan and the
backing plate/fan shroud  is going to be a little smaller and less
controlled without the nuts cinching things up. You will just install
the generator snug against the backing plate already installed into the
fan housing, and tighten it down with the strap as usual.  The studs
that these two missing 10 mm nuts are on will continue to locate the
generator for its correct position, going into their holes.  The first
time you set this up you will have a dissasembled fan housing and
backing plate after the conventional pain-in the ass removal, and as you
re-assemble you may get some interference of the fan and housing. This
is understandable because fan housing needs to be vertical and the side
points set up with nice washers.  See, you would normally find the
vertical allignment is established by the backing plate's connection to
the generator.  Without that, you want to help keep the correct location
of the fan shroud just with those anchor points that are sometimes not
even used, and its interference fit with the rest of the motor as it
touches the case.  It is worth a little setup to get this done, leading
some to perhaps correct bent edges of the shrouding connection that
interfere.  Thereafter, you can withdraw the generator carefully
straight outward, the hole in the backing plate is big enough to allow
the fan spacer parts on the generator shaft to come right through!
Now, my experience is only with the older fan shrouding, not the
doghouse cooler setups.  I suspect my oil cooler upright in there helps
to make the vertical position more of an initial given than it would in
a doghouse cooler, but it is not going to waste much time to try it out
as you do your next generator change.  I confess to once or twice
tweaking shroud alignment in some of my experiences doing this to five
cars.  Add another spacer washer as you go back together for added
clearance and it's likely you will have no problems.

Related tip:  Having trouble with belt setup, for having to max out the
adjustment range of the upper pulley to get the belt tight?  Just put a
shim under the generator in the stand, using a piece of thin sheet metal
cut to size.  It will make your fan belt life go up to have the correct
upper pulley width to fit the belt.  Don't set the belt any tighter than
necessary to avoid slipping and you will get 100000 on the generator
bearing, by the way that bearing can be changed and should be done to
keep using a good generator when that's all that is wrong.
