Subject: Fw: failure notice

I seem to remember reading 30K for bearings and 50K for CV's (relying on my
poor old memory), but I would tend to agree with Rick Taylor.and do it more
frequently. I decided to re-use my old CV's 12 months ago even though I had
new ones, and only re-packed them. Having just replaced them (~20k miles)
for the new ones I was surprised how much grease had been pushed out of the
joint and not doing it's job.
As per usual, it also depends on the use it get's. My bus see's mostly
highway use and a fair bit of off road stuff, so more regular servicing is
in order. If I was just running around town in it, I'd be happy to leave the
intervals much further apart.
