Subject: Canada, camping, screens and things?

Our family just got back from a week camping in Birds Hill Provincial park
near Winnipeg Manitoba, for our yearly sojourn to the Winnipeg Folk
Festival. I met a number of Bus people and was given a magnetic sign &quot;VW
Junkie&quot; by one? Helped out another who stalled in the festival parking lot
at three AM while honking to our rather raucous group who party while the
traffic clears, we got out the tester we had juice, took the line off we
had gas, went and parked our 77 next to Dave's 73(just for company) imbibed
a bit and when the planets aligned it started right up. It's always nice to
have fellow VWers around when the going gets tough. There were at least 50
bus's(within sight) all ages and types lots of slanted poptops across the
horizon of parked cars (ours was the only straight up pop-top? and people
loved the shade we can make with a large blue tarp attached to it) 
 
I'm writing for two reasons first to let fellow travelers know about this
wonderful event (perfect for a camping bus) this was the 25th year the
festivals been around it runs for 4 days and nights with more then 100
performers from all over the world, blues to African drumming and
everything in between. This was our 20th year and we've never had a bad
one, it's well run and the 20,000? who come over the 4 days are the
politest, friendliest crowd I've ever seen, lots of good energy, safe for
the kids. Many kinds of camping from no noise after 10:00 to one where you
can stay up all night playing the tuba. Anyway I highly recommend it and
would be glad to pass on info for next year, it always takes place the
weekend after the 4th of July.

It was a hot this year so them little mosquitoes were active, my 1977
Riviera camper is in excellent health and shape except for the screening in
the pop-top and I'm wondering if anyone has come up with a way to fix
without taking it off, it's two rectangular (straight up pop-top) pieces
maybe 2' by 6' long. Any ideas would be welcomed, also the best type of
screening to use?
 
Thanks much - (the border was breeze both ways!)
