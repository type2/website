Subject: 1974 van dies when warm

Hi,

We have a 1974 van, with dual Solex carburators, that dies when it gets warm and won't start again until the engine cools down.  This happens when idling or after driving for a while, stopping for 5 minutes and then trying to start out again. We recently replaced, 
spark plugs, rotor, cap, wires, points, adjusted the valves, timing and rebuilt the carburators.  So, now it starts off and runs nice until it is warm and then it starts losing RPM's and finally quits.

After it dies, if I look down the throat of the carburator and pull on the throttle, no gas shoots into the carburator.  Could this be vapor lock?  We live in Seattle if that's of any significance but it happens in both winter and summer.  If you suspect vapor lock, is there a way to test for that?  I've also read about an egr valve and similar problems but am not sure what it looks like or if our van has it anymore. Could this be the problem?  If so, how is this corrected?  If there's anything else you  recommend checking I'll be happy to take a look.

Thanks.

Jeff
