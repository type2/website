&lt;concerning replacing the front beam

&gt; All total, it took me three hours by myself and I was back on the road.

Very true.  Even with a lift I couldn't hope to match Scott's time on
this.  I'd start on Saturday morning and make sure that I had alternative
transportation to get to work on monday, just in case!

But then again, I've had engine swaps run two weeks because of little
things that needed attention that I hadn't noticed before the engine was
out!

Very important when dealing with axle beams is to make sure that they are
corrosion-proof.  Paint them well and make sure that they are well-filled
with grease at all times.  Rotten beams are no joke!
