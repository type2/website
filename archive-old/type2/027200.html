Hi Neil,
  I had a similar problem only it was with a gas smell&lt;smile&gt;...sorry couldnt stop myself....
anyway, start the beast and let it run for a minute... turn it off an check all your &quot;petrol&quot; lines.
sometimes they look fine but when you pinch them you will see that braided cover get wet
indicating you had best put new lines in.... or your carbs could be leaking a little if they are
starting to wear.... or there is a hidden splice on the left side of the engine compartment
which joins a break in the condensation lines (steel) which run from the top of the &quot;petrol&quot; tank
up into the air intake cavity on each side of das bus. Mine used to smell real bad right after
I filled the tank... I finally found this splice to be the source of the smell... BTW mine is a 74.
Good luck.

Any suggestions on petrol smell in Van, only happens when engine is
running.
