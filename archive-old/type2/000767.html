Volks,

1.
I'm ashamed to say that last night my original 1973 jack bent thanks to my
stupidity. 27 years of perfect functionality and then me.

Anyway I have been toying with buying a small 1-2 tonne trolley jack which
is about the same cost as a replacement jack. Should I buy a replacement VW
jack that'll fit in the original jacking points or can I carry a
trolley/floor jack around in my van.

Also where are the best places to put the trolley jack to jack it up?

2.
I had a really hard time trying to adjust the drums on my rear wheels. Does
anyone have any clever way's of doing this. Firstly the stars hardly move
and then I just can't figure out how they need adjusting. I can see very
little through those holes. Muir says you don't need to jack up the van but
then how do you rotate the wheel to check the brake linings.

I'd really appreciate any help with this
Max
