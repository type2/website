Subject: re:petronix ignition &amp; others generally (long)

Jensen queries about the operating principles of the Petronix ignition 
system and askes if there are other kinds not using coils.  

John: If you go back far enough you'll find internal combusion engines 
that don't use the induction coil to light the fuel.  There were 
hot-tube systems and flame-port systems use on stationary engines but 
in the automotive field the only one that I ever heard of that didn't 
use an induction coil was the Atwater-Kent rotary capacitor system.
All others that I am aware of use induction coils, either self 
induction type (with the breaker points inside the cylinder or valve 
pocket) or are of the Kettering type as used extensively in all cars 
except the Fort &quot;T's&quot;.  

In the past twenty five years we've seen improvements in the method of 
timing the spark by using transistors to amplify the breaker point 
function or a variant of that using either a tiny permanent magnet with 
a sensing coil or an optical interrupter device to replace the breaker 
points.  In these &quot;transistor amplified&quot; systems the objective is to 
either lessen the effect of breaker point bounce while increasing the 
dwell angle to assure staturation of the induction coil core.  An 
additional advantage is that it minimizes the electrical load on the 
points but increases the parts count.  

Another variant is the CDI (capacitive discharge ignition) system which 
still uses an induction coil but instead of saturating the coil primary 
on the &quot;make&quot;, a large capacitor, charged to 300 or more volts, &quot;zaps&quot; 
the coil primary.  The CDI system, although high on parts count is/was 
once said to produce the most intense spark at extremely high rpms when 
compared to the Kettering or transistorized Kettering system.
