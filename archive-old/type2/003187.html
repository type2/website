I was able to blow my stuck calipers out with compressed air, it didn't take
all that much.  But I wish I'd saved the rubber seals first.  They tore, and
getting replacements to fit right was so frustrating I ended up buying
rebuilt calipers (with trade in) and just bolting them on.  So...  save the
rubber (if it's good, or buy smarter than I did), take the whole caliper off
and just blow the pistons out.  Steel wool them smooth and pretty, but it
all back together again.  The Bentley manual has good instructions.
