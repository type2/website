Subject: First ever engine pull... Complete!

Hi all,

Thanks for the advice given and moral support lent.  Muchly appreciated.
This is probably old news for most listees, but the actual experience didn't
seem to match any book's or person's suggestions.  Biggest gripe was
probably due to a PO.  It seems that the engine tin was held together with
an amazing mix of bolts, star drive screws, both SAE and metric.  Ditto for
the exhaust system.  Sometimes 1/2&quot; nuts and bolts, sometimes 12mm,
sometimes 13mm.  What's the magic oil/grease/stuff for putting an exhaust
back together so that it can be taken apart again later?

The winner for the most unusual thing:  water pouring out of my FI
connector.
Most unnecessary thing:  a sling for the tranny, it's attached to the frame
already at the bell housing.
Thing that I should've been told to do:  remove the ignition coil to clear
the rear apron.
Thing that's impossible to do when told:  remove the oil filler tube before
the engine mounting bar is removed (it does NOT come off with the rear tin)
Thing that I didn't expect:  Getting covered in gas when removing the first
fuel line

5 hours start to finish, and a very enjoyable 5 hours it was.

(The parts list is already growing)

Later,
Niall
