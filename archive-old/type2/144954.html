Subject: [T2] Westfalia: Baywindow or Vanagon?

My first VW van experience was in a vanagon. 
Trip to the beach.  It broke down on the way.  It
was only a few months old.  

I also owned a daily driver 1.9 vanagon for a
while.  Large and comfortable, for sure.  Way
more power than any 2.0.  

&gt;If a guy has a bunch of time on his hands, and
doesn't mind crusin' at a monotonous at 50-60 mph
all day the Bay's are neat.

That's the best part.  I can cruise fairly
comfortable at 65 with a 1600.  Don't tell the T4
guys here, they say all drive 85mph.  Never mind
that VW listed the top speed at 72.  The ones on
Thesamba_dot_com say they drive around 100 or so coz
they all have Porch engines.  

&gt;A real pain to work on,but doable.

Yeah, the T4 is a pain in the arse for sure. 
Vanagon is fairly easy to work on, but one must
have parts to keep an old vehicle on the road. 
T4 parts are stupid expensive and Vanagon parts
are you gotta be kidding me expensive.  I find
myself wondering why I could buy a 350 chevy
longblock for cheaper than a guaranteed to fail
in 35,000-50,000 mile new vanagon head.  

The part situation for the vanagon isn't going to
change. Vanagons were produced in Germany and
South Africa only.  Since there were no vanagon
plants in Central or South America, there never
was a supply of affordable parts and never will
be.  As the German parts become NLA.  It's over. 


To a lesser extent, the same can be said for T4
parts, but they seem to be priced less.  

&gt;Not too bad to work on--a bunch easier than the
suitcase engine's of the later bay's.

Agreed it is physically easier to get a wrench on
most of the parts, but the biggest problem with
the wasserleaker was blown head gaskets. 
Replacing them with new soon to be blown head
gaskets and replacing the head (or JB welding it)
from all the pitting associated with the head
gaskets isn't easy work.  And the price of a new
set of head and gaskets? Around $1000 or more
just for parts.  

And coolant hoses, all 30 or so of them, cost
$500-1000.  And that doesn't include the NLA
ones.  That's why you and everyone else didn't
replace them.  I once bought an 84 wolfsburg
interior (spotless) because a surgeon scrapped
the vanagon with less than 50,000 miles on it
rather than pay $1000 plus labor to get his hoses
changed.  He bought a Dodge Caravan.  

Digitools/Boehler/FI harness patches for &quot;vanagon
syndrome.&quot;  Analog FI.  Now way man.  Rusted or
cracked center pipes.  $100 heater fans and $150
heater coils.  Rusted gas tanks (in that little
hump in the middle.)  Pot metal sliding door
handles that break every few years and cost $50. 
The nightmares are coming back.  

Vanagon?  Never again for me.  (Well, maybe a
diesel vanagon running veggie oil.)
