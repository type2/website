Subject: poptop seal

Ok list today I got the new seals I ordered from Bus Depot. The quality is
nice, I paid for the nicer ones.The seal going around the poptop came out
1/2&quot; short,but its no big deal. The luggage seal was perfect, but heres my
question The large seal which goes on the front of the poptop where the
carpet hangs down, is not staying up there very well Im not sure if I
installed it correctly as mine was non exisitence. Does the bevel go
towards the front of the bus?Do we use glue to make it stay on tight? All
the other seals are nice and tight any advice?
