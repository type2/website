Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Rear Wheel Bearings?  HELP!

&gt; &gt; Paging Rick Taylor - I recall he has invented a grease tool for this
&gt; &gt; normally unserviced item.

&gt; Thanks for the plug Dave, I wish I could loan this out to all the bus people
&gt; in order to save everyone the hard job of greasing their bus rear wheel
&gt; bearings and CV's  By keeping bearings greased it saves the hardest and most
&gt; expensive job of replacing the bearings!!  I have and will loan it locally
&gt; and the people who have used it, love it.

Well, do the next best thing and tell us how to make one!  :)
