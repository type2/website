Subject: ENGINE flywheel seal!! DID YOU INSTALL IT OR NOT?

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL


We just purchased a *crated* 1600 DP long-block engine *for another 71 bus
that we are restoring*. The engine builder said it had been run in their
test cell for an hour, and was *supposedly* ready to install.  After
assembling it to turn-key ready we installed it,  put in oil,  adjusted
valves, set the timing etc.  After it had run for about 5 minutes, we
noticed a considerable amount of oil coming out between the trany and the
engine. Ah, Oh, .. My first thought was the front engine oil seal since it
appeared to be engine oil and not the heavier trany oil.  Called the engine
builder, they said: We ran that engine for an hour if  their is an oil leak,
&quot; It's your problem/fault everything was good when we tested it&quot;.  Hmmm,
okay, what could we have done to cause this since we had only installed the
perefrial parts, and had nothing to do with the long block engine assembly.
We then asked them what they would suggest we do. They said:  1.  Take the
engine out.  2.  Disassemble it again.  3.  Ship it back to them *at my
cost* and they would check it. Oh man!_at_$%*&amp;$$$.....

So we listened to their suggestion on how to handle it. We then  pulled the
engine, pulled the pressure plate and disc off,  to discover oil on the
disc, and oil coming out on to the face of the flywheel.  This is where my
curiosity got the best of me.  I pulled off the flywheel checked the engine
oil seal,  it looked okay *though it was recessed in quite a bit*  and was
covered with HIGH TACK gasket sealant.  Looked inside the flywheel  to check
the flywheel O Ring and discovered THERE WASN'T ONE!!!  and it hadn't been
installed!!! unless of course it had disappeared?  I took pictures of
everything, and called a business neighbor of mine to come take a look, so
that I had a witness to the O ring not being in there.


I don't do machine work, or rebuild engines myself!

So the question is:  What would you do? 1. Demand reimbursement for
time/labor?  or  2.  Put the O ring in, find another engine builder, and
forget about it? or 3.???????



Bob, who is looking for the best air-cooled engine, at the very best
available rate.
