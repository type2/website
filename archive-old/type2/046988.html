Subject: Re: [T2] Converting 69 Westy to electric refridgerator

Hey there, offer my experience. Having trouble posting to the list so
p-mail to you.

The fridge in my 78 died (this is a horizontal chest style fridge) so i
pulled the ammonia powered guts out, very hard to do in-situ, but possible.
Now I am attempting to install a Peltier device in place of the original
cooling mechanism. A Peltier is a thermoelectric device where you apply
power and one side gets cold and one side gets hot. This is how those 12V
coolers work. I got mine from www.meci_dot_com and I believe it is a salvaged
unit from one of those 12V coolers. It's $20 (w 2 heatsinks) and they do
have a temp control available, but with no directions so you need to have a
clue to use it (I don't). I am going to try to use my old fridge control
since it has a temp sensor etc.

In testing I got the cold heatsink totally frosted over which is a good
sign.

The problem I have run into is the thickness of the wall of the fridge, it
is thicker then this heatsink|Peltier|heatsink sandwich. I've taken it
apart and I'm going to flatten out some copper (good heat transfer) pipe to
make spacers so the assembly is wide enough. Then I need to add some 12V
fans to increase the efficiency of the heatsinks.

The positive is it is inexpensive, much smaller then the original ammonia
powered rig in the late westies (so it has a better chance of fitting in
the upright cooler early westies), draws about 6 Amps which I think is
about the same as the ammonia powered rig.

The negative is it still uses 12V so you can't run it for long when
stopped. An RV fridge, though $$$ big bucks, is usually 3 way,
12V/120V/propane which means you can run it all weekend when camping.
