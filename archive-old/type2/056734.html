Subject: Overheating after engine is off

Hello All

Last night got my 72 westy road worthy and got to drive it
all over the place. Apparently is had been parked for
several years however, everything seems to work great. A
little low on power, but think some tuning might remedy
that.

My concern is with the engine temp.  When driving it, no
problem.  Shut it off and it'll turn right back over with a
twitch of the starter.  Sit 15 minuted and it takes 10
seconds of cranking and gas to start.  Then it seems to be
fine.

My only possible explanation is that the heat propigates
thru the engine and makes everything hot, absence of blowing
air.  Is this expected, or shoud I worry and do some
digging.  All the engine tin is there, and it has a good
engine compartment seal.

One other thing.  The thermostat.  Mine doesn't move.  It
appears to be expanded completly.  The wire has no tension.
Does this mean the flaps are closed and I'm restricting air
flow or are they always open.  I plan to replace it, however
I don't want to cause damage in the mean time.

Thank
Brent
