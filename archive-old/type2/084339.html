Start by verify your timing.  Incorrect timing can lead to backfiring,
hard-starting, and power loss.  Get a timing light on there, check
Bentley and make sure it is to spec.  If not, time it correctly.  

Check and double-check that the distributor drive clamp is tight.  If it
isn't, the distributor may inadvertently turn and throw off your
timing.  Post again with what you find.

Hope this helps

&gt; 
&gt; 1974 Bus (1800cc) with 115k. Distributor vacuum diaphram went bad so 
&gt; I replaced the vacuum advance with a vacuum only unit rather than the 
&gt; original vacuum/retard unit.
&gt; 
&gt; Van runs OK with the minor problem of a rare backfire. Could be 
&gt; timing or idle setting now 1000 rpm.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the strange part. I drove around town this morning and pulled 
&gt; into the gas station. Starting with a third tank of gas I fill the 
&gt; tank putting in 10 gallons. Immediately, the car will not run. It 
&gt; takes a long time to begin firing and then it immediately dies.
&gt; 
&gt; I run the battery flat trying to get it running. Gas is coming out 
&gt; the exhaust. Clearly flooded. We quick charge the battery. Finally it 
&gt; starts but runs terribly. By taking a long route home, I avoid 
&gt; stopping and letting the engine disengage until I get home. A couple 
&gt; of times the engine just looses power and nearly dies. Then it 
&gt; regains some power, never very much.
&gt; 
&gt; It has done this act twice before when I have filled the tank.
&gt; 
&gt; I have checked the floats in both carbs and they seem OK.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions will be most welcome. I hope you have never 
&gt; encountered this strange problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; Herb
