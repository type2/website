Subject: Hicups

I have been experiencing an ongoing annoiance with my 71 bus.  It drives =
great (most of the time) but occasionally feels as though it is not =
getting enough gas and will hicup or lunge slightly.  This happens only =
in 2nd and 3rd gear and not all the time.  I have replaced the fuel pump =
and things seemed to be better for a while but the problem has now =
returned.  Are there any suggestions?  Carb, ditributor, etc.  Please =
help.  A local mechanic told me to look for floating points, what does =
this mean?

Also, I have the normal oil leaks.  I replaced the drain plate excepting =
that things would get better, they did not!  The leak seems to be coming =
from an area in front of the sump pan and up towards where the engine =
and transmission come together.  Do I have a problem or should I just =
keep a good eye on the oil level.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Scott
71 bus
