FOR SALE IN DENVER, CO (no connection to sale. . .)

Heres and example of the year/model bus that won the recent &quot;best bus&quot;
vote on the list::

-1978 Westy, Champagne Edition
-Orginal Owner, 94 k miles on bus
-20k on rebuilt motor
-Dakota Beige over Agate Brown
-Chrome Bumpers and strips (fair condition on the strips)
-BA6 Factory-installed gas heater (hasn't run for a couple of years)
-Brown-green plaind interior (instead of the usual CE material)
-Stove, sink, propane, etc.
-Dual batteries, fridge worked until deep-cycle battery died
-Canvas is pretty weak
-Passes current Colorado emission test (Pretty impressive! In Denver these
 are dyno-based tests and some of the more stringent specs in the Country)
-Owner is asking $3750 for it but may take a little less

Irwin, the original owner, says the bus can be driven anywhere. It
has no rust but has some less-than-perfect repairs to some dings and
zings in the body.  Does not have the factory AC, hitch, side-step or
radio but has everything else.  Couldn't tell from my brief phone 
conversation if the intermittent wipers were installed and/or working.
Motor/clutch was rebuilt 20k ago by a fussy Porsche mechanic in Denver
who is known for good work.  Asking price seems fair but may be flexible.
I haven't seen this bus and have no connection with the owner or the sale.
But, from the sound of it, someone could get a nice '78 CE to complete
restoration on and enjoy.  Caveat emptor, YMMV, etc. Irwin said serious
calls only please!

IRWIN'S NUMBERS:

Work Phone:  		303-770-2046

Home Phone:  		303-790-7629



Happy trails,
