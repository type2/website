hello fellow listers,

i've finished the insulating and vapor barrier project
on my bus and have a huge amount of fiberglass
insulation leftover ( i bought the smallest size from
home depot and only used less than one sheet).  if
anyone wants pink panther insulation please feel free
to contact me.  i live in san francisco near the
panhandle. 

have a great day,

tesa
