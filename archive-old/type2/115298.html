Subject: Cleaning the engine carbon

Someone on the list gave a reference url link to an article (like an email 
message) where someone cleaned out the carbon in their engine.

I cannot find it...  Does anyone recall??


It seems the driver fed a 1/2 can of something like BG 44 thru their brake 
vacuum hose to the intake manifold while the engine was idling, and then 
poured the rest in the tank.


There was something else, an addition to the oil.


The person then drove their vehicle and a huge black cloud came out and 
followed the vehicle for a while.  But the end results were fantastic!!

Can anyone direct me ??

TIA
