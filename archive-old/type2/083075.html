&gt; Unless someone on the FMBC or the type2 list is 
willing to sell you 
&gt; one your best bet is ebay. They can be had for less 
than $20. If you 
&gt; want a new one you can go ahead and buy it as Andrew 
suggested and 
&gt; then download the color wiring diagram from 
www.vintagebus_dot_com. I did 
&gt; this for my 67 and then laminated the color print and 
kept it in the 
&gt; bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck.

You can make a super easy to read color diagram by 
inserting the downladed jpeg into powerpoint. Select one 
section at a time from the main slide(set up to print 
out on 8.5x11 paper) and paste each section into its own 
slide in the same presentation. Now each section is 
blown up to 8.5x11. The printed image is actually 
10x7.5, so you have 4 2.5 inch sctions across and 3 
down. I did this with almost no loss of quality. I'm 
thinking of having the 12 sheets mounted on a poster 
board. Not exactly portable, but I also printed out the 
original slide to slip in the betley.
