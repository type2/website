I remember there was a CB book I used to check out when I was in high 
school that not only had a list of 10 codes but 11,12, 13, etc on up to 
some high numbers.  I don't know who is the authority on these codes but 
there was some pretty nasty stuff you could say with numbers only.  I 
don't know the name but a good WEB search may turn something up...
