Subject: Need a part

Folks,

I am looking for the front half of the air filter holder(air intake)
for my 78 bus. That would be the half that is *not* attached to the
afm.  In other words, the part you would take off to change the air filter
on a regular fi engine.  It was missing when I got it from the po.

It is the only part I know of that I need to get the engine back on the
road!

If anyone has one please pmail me.

Thanks ,dave
