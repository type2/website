&gt;can anybody tell me the physical differances between 36 and 40 HP judson
&gt;superchargers?  also, what does the parts list include?

I think the 36hp ones have 2 pulleys, the 40 has one, and the 40 has an
idler arm for belt tension.

You also need the aluminum &quot;Jusdson&quot; air cleaner, oiler, jar, pulley, and a
little linkage doohickey.  I think there is also a hose between the oiler
and the blower.               

&gt;thanks.  (this is for my bug.  if only they would fit into a bus w/o
&gt;cutting it up.  sigh.)

It would fit in my '54 just fine: I had one lined up to buy, but the guy
flaked...
