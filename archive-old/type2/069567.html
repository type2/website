&gt;       2: I need one new headlight assembly (i.e. glass lens, bucket
&gt; thing, etc.) can I use a beetle one or does anyone have a spare one for
&gt; sale?
A beetle ons should work, turned sideways. The adjusting will be different, I
think.
&gt;       4: I'm replacing some brake lines along with the master cylinder
&gt; and the whole brake system is dry.  How much brake fluid is needed for the
&gt; whole system?
I replaced the entire brake system on my '67. I assume you've checked your
wheel cylinders as well. While you have everything off, it's a good idea to
blow out the metal lines with compressed air to clean out any crusties
remaining.
As for brake fluid, go ahead and a couple of the BIG bottles. You'll need a lot
to get everything bled correctly, and it's always a good idea to have plenty in
case you need it...
