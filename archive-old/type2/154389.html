Subject: What engine is this?

Hey guys,

    I just bought a VW Bus motor from the local junkyard. There was a poor
type 2 sitting there in the yard that was my same year, so I was pulling parts
off of it. It had some crazy looking orange plaid upholstery inside... (pretty
cool actually). Anyway, there was an engine sitting on the passenger seat. I
don't BELIEVE that it goes to that Bus because it had fuel injection, but this
Bus that it was sitting in didn't have a computer ANYWHERE...

Anyway, luckily the motors don't weight that much, so I was able to put it in
the wheel barrow and put it in the trunk of my Crown Vic.

I was wondering if you guys wouldn't mind giving me some information. I'm
trying to figure out exactly what kind of Bus motor this is.

The only number I saw was &quot;GD042787&quot;.

I have an 1800 in my Bus now, I'm hoping it's at least that size.

I figured I would use it as a spare and rebuild it.



Thanks,

Todd
