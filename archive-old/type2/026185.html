Your brother's engine might not be running hot at all.  Go to
www.geneberg_dot_com and read the Tech Tip on &quot;Why we don't sell gauges.&quot;  The
Gene Berg dipstick sensor is the only one I trust.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I am sending this out on behalf of my Brother who is trying to work the
&gt; kinks out of his new 1776.  It is in a 71' standard and he is having temp
&gt; issues.  The motor has about 200 miles on it and is running between 425
&gt; and
&gt; 450 down the road (as per the new VDO cylinder head temp gauge, 55-60
&gt; mph). 
&gt; As for the particulars, 1776 w/ new 009 &amp; standard blue streak points, 34
&gt; pict3, bosch blue coil, extractor exhaust and a very mild cam.  
&gt;
