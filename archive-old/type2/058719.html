&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Doin battle with my steering box.  A 74.  I have about a half turn
of steering
&gt; wheel play.  Checked and it seems to be the box and not ball joints.
Don't think
&gt; it is adjustable, but I am looking at over 200.00 for a rebuilt one
and thought
&gt; I would check.  Anyone adjusted the play out of a 74 steering box?
&gt; 
&gt; Checked busted bus and Mr Erskine says he did on a 72, but I can't
find an
&gt; adjustment nut as he describes.

The steering box was changed from a worm and peg design to a worm and
roller design in August 1973  The new design, while more durable,
isn't adjustable.
