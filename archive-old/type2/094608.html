It's not all-metal, but virtually all of the stressed parts are made of
metal.  For example, the triggers and levers you pull to open the doors
are metal on a bus, but plastic on modern vehicles.&gt;&gt;
I think it was sort of plastic on my 1973 Squareback...The door handles, =
that is. Might have been with my 73 Beetle too. =20
TJ, who can't for the life of him remember what the handles on his 1978 B=
us are made of right now...Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer down=
