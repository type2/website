&gt; decide to go.

I believe that the EGR helps keeps head temps down...I think.. someone 
else can confirm.

&gt; I understand that holes in this part could cause the engine to run
&gt; lean(thanks Karl).  That being said Karl also stated that it could cause a
&gt; vacuum leak as well.  If I am not mistaken the brake servo operates off

Yeah, it will run lean, and it will make the engine run hotter.

&gt; the vaccuum system does it not?  If my brake servo doesn't work, couldn't
&gt; this be part of the problem?  I know I am kind of beating the brake servo

Well, then you gotta look at when the egr valve is open.  It's closed at 
idle and full throttle.  Unless you like to press on the gas while 
you're braking, you won't be getting any air coming into your manifold 
during braking.

&gt; thing to death, but its one of my main goals, that and solving my starting
&gt; problem(which I believe is related to the hot start problem these tend to

If you want, you can disable the egr valve by disconnecting it from the 
throttle valve.  However, who knows if the valve is even working 
correctly.  Usually, they tend to clog up, so it's kinda in your favor.

What you might want to do is first get a fire extinguisher, then start 
your car, then spray starter fluid at your hose junctions and see if you 
hear an increase in rpm.  If it goes up, you've found yourself a leak.
