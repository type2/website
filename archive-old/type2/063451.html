Weston -
Keep me posted on this, both my '80s leak.  The Beige one has had it 
for a while &amp; I keep it topped up, the small amount drips on the 
inside of the steering column cover, but that's it.  When the fluid 
gets low, the brake lights may stop working as the pressure of air in 
the system isn't enough to actuate the pressure based brake light 
switches, BTDT.  
The Brown one I just bought and PO didn't even know where the 
brake fluid resevoir was, and couldn't figure out why the drivers
floor was always wet, DUH!  But never had braking problems though, 
the fluid level was just below the low mark when I bought it.
Haven't had time to investigate what the problem is.
My success rate with hydraulics is low, so am postponing this work 
until my attitude is proper for the anticipated task.

&gt; The mc leaks. Seems to be unrelated to braking but the plugs or seals that
&gt; the fluid resevoir fits into seem to be wet. I suspect those plugs are tired,
&gt; it's a matter of a few drips a day. Is this to be expected?
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like those can simply be replaced by pulling the resevoir and
&gt; fitting new plugs without actually removing the mc. Are those available
&gt; somewhere?
