Subject: Re Interesting Radio

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Just bought my '68 Westy and it has a three band radio in it which we found
&gt;rather odd although this may not be? The third band doesn't seem to pick up
&gt;anything at all and the bands are labeled U, L and M. I have the schematic
&gt;in the manuals I got with my camper.
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone tell me what this third band is for?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Jen
&gt;'68 Westy

Here in the UK (If memory serves)

L= Long wave
M= Medium Wave (AM)
U (or I have seen UKW) used to mean FM or VHF

Which one does not work?
