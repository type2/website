&gt;Steve Dolan is in New Mexico and having some engine problems.  The MSHP 2.2
&gt;litre he is running in his Vanagon is running hotter than acceptable.
&gt;
&gt;This means that he may indeed need another engine.  He will be heading
&gt;along 40 west toward southern california.
&gt;
&gt;If there is anyone out that way with a good running used 2.0 litre engine
&gt;that severl of us could buy, and get to steve or have him meet it somewhere
&gt;it would be great.  I will help pay for it and take care of the cost along
&gt;with some other listy's.  I have comitted 50 bucks to the cause.  HELP IF
&gt;YOU CAN!
&gt;
&gt;This guy takes one vacation every two years and this is it.  He works hard
&gt;for this list so let's help him if we can folks.  We may or may not need it
&gt;but it would be good to know it is there if we do.
&gt;
&gt;Come on list, you helped me so much and this is my chance to give back a
&gt;little.  Join me in this cause to help out our type 2 brother.

     Don't know about funding, but I can offer a good parts source. 
Desert Autohaus in Victorville CA, just off I 15 on D st., assuming he 
makes it into CA and across the desert. If he's headed that way give me a 
holler and I'll tell Darryl to expect him...


Peace,
