Howdy Volks,

I have just bought a 73 Westy...This is my 4th bus but
all my others have been late models..With the late
models there is an electric pump and I guess the early
models are manual.Anyway, I can't seem to get the sink
to work. It looks like everything is hooked up
properly, I put water in and went to pumping..nothing
happened..Any advice on how to make this thing work.

Also, I'm installing a new pop top canvas this
weekend..if anyone could give me any advice on the
best and easiest way to do this..I would really
appreciate it. Thanks for your help. Please email me
directly with responses..THANKS!!

Greg
