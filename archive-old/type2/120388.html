Subject: bumper

I'm actually posting this question for Gowesty..  who has their front carpet in 2 sizes (68-73 and 74-79).
I ordered the first (mine's a 73) and got the wrong size.  I didn't think about it that the difference was due to the inside step created with the new bumpers.
Question Bill asked me:  was their a half-year introduction of the new bumper in 73 or do all 73's have the new bumper with step inside?  I told him all 73's to my knowledge and that they need to change their listing to 68-73 and 74-79.  Am I right?
thanks and Happy Friday!  -Chris
