Well, you beat me on the milage, I beat you on still having the original
engine at 227,000 mi on the 78 Westy!  Everything is original except
starter, usual seals and hose bits, clutch, set of lifters, steering
damper, front window cranking apparatus, and recently, I replaced the cv
joints while the engine was out for the clutch.  The $3500 I paid in
1985 was a sound expenditure!  
     I'm curious if you noticed how much push-pull play you have on the
rear wheels (mine's pretty significant), but silent.  Camber is like 2
degrees also, wheels toe out at bottom.  Also, was the steering relay
lever bushing ever replaced?  I'm getting overdue;  original front end,
passed the 
&quot;turning the wheel inspection while lifted&quot; but going over bumps
shakes it and you can see the lever go up and down when someone turns
the steering (bus not jacked up) while I look underneath.

&gt; My Westfalia has 256 K on it, the previous owner kept meticulous
&gt; maintenance records (a genuine rocket scientist, I still have his
&gt; Association decal on my rear window) I haven't found any record of
&gt; replacement of the rear wheel bearings and each time I've put my van on
&gt; jack stands and run the drive wheels I find that the bearings are very
&gt; silent (I'd expect this with no-load conditions).
