engine from a hole burned in a  piston 


hello Robt     The normal cause of holes in pistons is  timing being off or 
too lean . it could be that the water injection caused a  lean condition.  on 
rebuilding the motor you would be better off getting a  set of rods that have 
been rebuilt and replacing the pistons and clylinders with  new. I would also 
recommend rebuilding your heads at the least  later   mark Dearing
