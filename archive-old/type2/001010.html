Hi all,

     I just replaced my master cyl. because it was just starting to leak.  I
have a problem that I thought was related but now it is still there.  When I
press on the brake pedal the pedal will go to the usual place stop &amp; then
move just a fraction more.  Almost like a pause or a step.  The brakes are
not affected by this.  They are strong &amp; firm with no sponginess.  Another
side note.  When I bled the brakes the fluid really did not come out with
the force I have seen in the past when I opened the bleeder valve.  After
all the air was out, the fluid just sort of flowed out with not very much
force.  Again the brakes do not seem to be affected by this at all.  Any
ideas or should I just not worry about this?
