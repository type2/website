Subject: [T2] Fw: so lets talk about transmissions

 Heavy duty American trucks do not use synchromesh transmissions.  It is 
possible to &quot;no clutch&quot; these transmissions after start, although not 
recommended by the manufacturers.
 
 European trucks use synrhomesh transmissions and the manufactures 
recommend to NEVER shift gears unless the clutch is fully released
otherwise the synchros will wear extremely fast.
 
 Using any transmission with synchros requires a full clutch release for
proper operation and long life.
 
 Think about it.  :)
