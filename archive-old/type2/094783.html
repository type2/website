Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen


An easy way to prevent an unwanted guest from starting your bus, even with 
the key, is to hide a small pushbutton(like an alarm reset switch, available 
at ANY alarm retailer/installer)that you press as you start the vehicle.  
Hide it where you like.  No pressure, no start!

&gt;I was wondering what do you guys do to keep your busses from being stolen?  
&gt;I was thinking of making it use a push button starter that could be hidden 
&gt;in the bus somewhere, like behind the seat, or something of that nature.
