Ok, OK...so all of you guy who are all knowing and can remove and reinstall 
an engine in a couple of hours...
anyone interested in helping me out in replacing my engine in my 71?  I would 
love to get it up and running soon!
It would need to be done at my folks house...who by the way, have a great, 
nicely stocked heated garage with all the tools nessecary...and i can provide 
beer and pizza (and good conversation). 
Any one interested in helping me get it back on the road???
BTW, it's in Southern Maryland. 

Thanks, 
Melissa
