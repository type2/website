I hope someone out there has some insight for me..

I have almost completed rebuilding my motor for my '78 doublecab. I have the
original dual carb setup that came off of it (this DC is an odd one - type
IV - check out http://www.insync_dot_net/~kittman/78dblcab.htm if you are
interested). I have rebuilt the motor using a Vanagon case, hydraulic
cam/lifters, etc. I am at the point in assembly that I am about to install
the manifold and carbs. Since the original motor had a mechanical fuel pump,
I need to install an inline electrical fuel pump. *However*, I have
purchased an entire FI system from a fellow listmember. I would like to
install this FI setup on the DC. Since the truck has never had FI, there is
no wiring setup for it. What do I need to do to prepare for the FI? Is the
only wiring difference in the engine compartment? Am I *crazy*? Doomed to
fail?! I know that I'll need to pull the tank and install a return fuel line
from the fuel system. I have FI on the '76, and have been extremely pleased
with it.

Should I:

a) Install the carbs and electrical fuel pump and just be happy with that;

b) Install the carbs and electrical fuel pump *for now* and work installing
the FI later;

c) Do the necessary modifications and install the FI now, and sell the
carbs; or

d) Other

Any and all comments are appreciated!
