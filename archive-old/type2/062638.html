Subject: Re: Need Some Options on Carbs

I get about 18 in the city and maybe 21-22 o the freeway, at 55 or so.  I
drive a '74 with newly rebuilt carbs, but they have worn bushings on them.
I don't thik this affects performance, but it won't idle below 1100.
While cruising around, I get what I think is pretty good mileage,
averaging 19 on a tank.

The dual carbs are a pain in the butt.  I hate them.  But, the
alternative is not good-no emissions waivers without the dual carb setup.
I managed to pass  last time, but if I fail I'm in trouble with a single
aftermarket carb.  My recommendation is to stick with the stock setup, if
at all possible.
