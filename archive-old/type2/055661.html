Subject: Re: Mexican 1600dp longblock group purchase

Steve and list:
I've thought about this before, but my version was to purchase a bunch
of new Mexican cases as opposed to the whole longblock.... this way we
each have complete control over the components that go into our
babies. I'm sure that a Mexican longblock is using all Brazilian
goddies, whereas I'd prefer to go German with certain things(i.e.
bearings).
We might even be able to talk some of our SoCal or Az. brothers and
sisters to go down there and save us all the International shipping
and customs charges. Sounds like a great bus club adventure. 
If each adult can cross the boarder with two bottles of liquor duty
free, than it must be at least three VW cases per adult.
