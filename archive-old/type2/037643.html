Subject: minor oil leak, end of camshaft

Well, I finally had it with the oil leak in my '79 Westy - it wasn't
losing much, but enough so that it leaves stains everywhere.  So, I took
off the fan housing to expose the oil pump (my best guess at the culprit).
Close, the leak was actually to the right and down - I believe it is the
end of the camshaft.

My question now: is there a way to seal off the end of the camshaft?
Possibly some high temp silicone?  I'm not about to split the case!
I've heard of using joint compound between the case and end of the 
camsahft when reassembling the engine.  What is that stuff exactly?  Can I
use that to form an outside seal?

Thanks!  Any help is appreciated!
