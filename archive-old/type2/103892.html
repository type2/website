&gt; Sounds like the electrical portion of the ignition

&gt; same problem. Bus depot should have the part. Phil

I had this happen to my bus back in 1995 timeframe and my beetle back in
1990 timeframe. I'm trying hard to remember what the cause was but it wasn't
the ignition switch in either case...
