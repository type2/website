Hi there,

I was just talking with Ron van Ness about T1/t2 radarvehicles last week
when suddenly a picture of such a vehicle appeared in our local
newspaper yesterday. The picture was taken 6th of October 1964 when the
police showed their new equipment to justice department personnel in the
Frieslandhall here in Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.

Notice the front of the bus, it is quite different than of those radar
vehicles I have seen so far. Wonder what happened to these cars.

You can view the picture at:

Uhm, one more minor detail, don't forget the Porsche 356 in front that
almost blocks your view to the wonderful bus.
