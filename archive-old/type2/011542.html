hey volks,
i accidentally only sent this back to Art and not the
list.   being in omaha, smack dab in the middle of the
country, anyone travelling the lonely roads out here
can certainly drop in anytime for whatever you need.  
just a phone call away and you've got a new home.  on
another note, i was just wondering if anyone has
called the funeral home listed on the Kristin site to
see if it is ok to send flowers or whatever and if so,
the address to send them to etc.   i just dont want to
flood the funeral home with a ton of calls so if
someone has called if you could pmail me or put up a
one time email to the list with the info.
thank you.
