Subject: Re: How/why did you get your first bus?  (friday ramblings, long)

My first bus was a '57 singlecab.  While still a young hippy walking down
Hearst Avenue in Berkeley in 1972 I saw an old singlecab truck.  Instantly
I knew that this was the vehicle that I always wanted!  It took a couple
of years, but here's how it happened.

I bought an 8-track player (yeah, I'm way too old) from a roommate in my
frat-house/hippy place.  I got some real cool folk-music tapes with it, and
I really bought it for the box of tapes.  I paid $50 (It was alot of tapes,
and a pretty nice player, sigh) but was informed that I had to remove it
from the car ASAP, since the junkyard was coming to take the car away.
&quot;Well&quot;, I said, &quot;I need a car for my new tape deck.  How much is the junk
yard giving you?&quot;  Turned out he was paying to have his dead car removed, 
and he gave me the car, so I'd have some more time to pull the tape deck.

I looked into this beast, and realized all that college engineering stuff
was going pay off!  I figured out that I could re-plumb the fluidic computer
that ran the clutch and get it running again! (I know this sounds strange,
but this was a 1961 Mercedes 220s with an automatic clutch and a four-speed
manual shift on the column).  A sodium-filled exhaust valve, new brakes, and
I was the proud driver of a classic Mercedes with a cool 8-track!  Fast
forward, many thousands of miles on that $50 machine...

I drove to my new job in Yosemite Valley, arriving in the middle of one of
our great Sierra snowstorms, sliding into a &quot;parking space&quot; amidst the
three feet of snow.  About a week later (I XC skied to work that week) I
saw that I was parked next to a singlecab, and that the owner of it was
looking at my MBZ!  We talked, and his singlecab was missing third gear,
and my MBZ was rusted out, and had a wee crack in the block, and he wanted
$500 for the VW, and did I want to trade.  You bet!

So, in 1975, I traded the Mercedes that I got for free with the purchase
of an 8-track for my first VW bus.  I met my wife while owning that bus,
travelled all over, went through many engines, and a couple of tranny's,
and lots of mousy-acorns stuffed in...

Lots of memories.  

Almost a year ago, while driving home from work one night, a deer jumped
into my path while I was driving at 60mph.  I survived, but alas the bus
did not.  It did hold up enough in the subsequent crash to keep me in
one piece.  I had intended to keep the wreck, and retire it as a planter
at my place.  When I finally saw the poor thing, though, it was too torn up.
Lots of torn, ripped metal.  Many cuts on our hands getting things from
the remains, and I decided that I could not have it around my children,
and let it be taken off to the junkyard.  The insurance company gave me
$2500 for it, which is what I paid for the Kombi Syncro, another cool
truck, but I sure miss my old ride.  20 years of service for me.  The
valve covers now sit on the heads of the Kombi -- 1957 covers on a 1986
bus.  I have four Vanagons, now (one is a parts bus) but I still miss my old
truck something fierce.  My shoes remained crushed into the floorboards 
of the '57 -- we could not exrtact them, so the bus kept something of me, too.
I hope it's not too lonely, and that it gave up some good bits to keep other
old busses alive for a while longer.

I feel like crying.
