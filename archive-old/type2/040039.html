Subject: Shameless Plug for John Connolly at Aircooled_dot_net

A quick, shameless plug for John Connolly at Aircooled_dot_net:

I took advantage of John's recent generous offer of free shipping and a great 
price on the Sway-A-Way swaybar kit for loaf buses.  His online ordering is 
fairly straight-forward and quick and I got fast e-mail responses from him with 
the questions I had.  I got an almost immediate on-line confirmation of my 
order and I received a confirmation invoice in the mail 2 days later.  The 
swaybar kit arrived at my doorstep only 4 days after I ordered it.

I don't know when John came on the scene - I just started seeing his input on 
things one day.  But I CAN say for certain that I'll be ordering from him again!
