&gt; Been trying to get my 75 back on the road again so I can meet some of you list
&gt; members at the Jerome weekend. Spent last weekend installing new brake hoses
&gt; and front wheel bearings. That went well. This weekend I removed my rear axles
&gt; in order to install some new ones complete with installed cv joints and boots.
&gt; I thought this would make things easier. Well, not quite the case. Turns out
&gt; the new axles are over 20&quot; long. Wonder what they could be for? I suspect they
&gt; were drop shipped from the manufacturer, not shipped from the folks I ordered
&gt; them from.

sounds like you got Right side auto tranny shaft....Auto tranny is offset
to one side and half shafts are two different lengths, right side is
almost exactyl 20inches.  505mm.   manual tranny half shafts are only
476mm long.

check the half shalf does it have a ridge on it about midway.  this ridge
designates an auto tranny half shaft.
