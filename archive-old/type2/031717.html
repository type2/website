time well spent

&gt; They are not a save device to use under drive wheels since the drive

&gt; damaging your car or sending them flying like a 40 pound bullet.
&gt; Think safety guys! If you want to call me a fool while you're in the body
&gt; shop or emergency room I'll accept that you will be more careful in the
&gt; future.

what I do most of the time is jack up the rear, put the drive on ramps
under the wheels facing towards the front of the van.  then put some wood
or cinder block under the ramp, in case it colapses, and then jack stands
under the torsion tubes, and also leave the jack under the center of the
van, as back up to the backup, call me paranoid but I have seen the damage
a falling vehicle can do to a human.

when I'm done I can then just drive down off the ramps, slowly.
