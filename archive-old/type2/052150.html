I forgot one thing that these three dealers do for us, 10% to 15% discount 
for parts for club members.  This really helps for those more expensive parts!

&gt; So far, we, the Twin Cities Volkswagen Club, have a very good relationship 
&gt;  with three of the four local Volkswagen dealers.  Burnsville, West Side 
and 
&gt;  Countryside all have taken turns sponsoring our spring swap meets.  The 
&gt;  annual show is held at West Side and they usually let us move the new cars 
&gt;  off of the lot for them.
&gt;  
&gt;  Hopefully this does not change.
