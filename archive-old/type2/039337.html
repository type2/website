Subject: compression test

I am having a compression test done on a 81 camper before I buy it. I
am having the test done at a vw dealer that has nothing to do with
the sale. How should I interpret the results. I am in Denmark, so it
will probably be in metric readings? The seller tells me that the
camper has only been used in the summer and placed in storage during
the winter, and has only been driven 93,000 KM. I figure it could be
193,000 KM just as well, and this is why I'm having the test done.
Any suggestions.
