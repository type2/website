Subject: Q: Pressurizing windshield washer

'71 Loaf.  Both books I have (Muir and Clymer) say to pressurize the
windshield washer fluid to 40 psi at the local gas station's tire pump.
However, the cap I have that goes onto the spout where you fill the fluid
doesn't have any sort of nozzle to fit a tire air pump... how is this
done?  Do I put the air pump onto the nozzle where the washer would spray
onto the windshield?
