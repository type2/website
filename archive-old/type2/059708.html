Subject: Splitties FS in Mid-Missouri?

A fellow e-mailed me to tell me he was going to be in Rolla, MO soon to
visit relatives and wanted to take the time to check out any pre-68 Busses
that might be for sale in the area.  I knew of nothing off-hand, so I
thought I'd turn to the list.  Anyone know of anything?

(I left his e-mail address at work, so send replies through me).

Thanks!
