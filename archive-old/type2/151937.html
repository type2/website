the Govenor is leaking??? that can.

&gt; Any idea where I can order such things?  The Bus Depot can't get them.

they are unobtanium, if you find a source let me know because I wouldn't
mind having a new one.   unless yours is really really screwed up they can
usually be cleaned up enough to work

good luck
