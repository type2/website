Subject: Re: [T2] &amp;*^&amp;!!!! oil filter length and removal

This is what I use for assistance when the filter is on too tight:

OilFilterHelper.jpg

It's a rubber disc used to remove the tops of jars and lets me apply  
additional grip to the base of the filter instead of just the sides.

The Mann/Mahle filters both have the same fluted base which has  
always been frustrating when looking for a filter wrench:

I contacted Mann sometime ago about their wrench tool for their bus  
filters but they don't sell it anymore. I tried several Porsche  
suppliers because some of their filters have the same flutes but  
everyone was stumped.
