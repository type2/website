Subject: Re: [T2] cam questions

Clark,

True, I like to see 70 -80 in my type 4, but this was 
a T1 single port....If he can keep it at about 3600rpm(65mph?)
then it might last forever with an aluminum case.

I don't think he mentioned any year, and somehow I kept thinking
reduction gears....need more coffee&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; I know we're talking about a cam, but thats why the
&gt; type4 bus engines are designed to see around 40
&gt; degrees total advance - to deliver power up high,
&gt; right?
&gt; 
&gt; just blabbing,

&gt; &gt; Sounds pretty good&gt; 
&gt; A *very* mild cam might help a little on the
&gt; &gt; top end...but are you
&gt; &gt; really going to go there in a bus?
