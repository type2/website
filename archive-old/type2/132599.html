 &gt;&gt;i have a chance of getting goodyear tires for my bus at a good price.
What kind of goodyears should i get and at what rating is the best...&lt;&lt;

Sam,

this is yet another big can o' worms &amp; potential flame war. check the 
library. it has the basics &amp; you can come back with more specific 
questions later.

some tips to get you started:
-do NOT put passenger car tires on your bus (if it starts with 'P' then 
avoid it, you want 'LT' tires)
-the stock size is LT185R14
-get load range C, or step up to D if you have a camper
-inflate to the pressure as suggested by Bentley or owner's manual

of course YMMV,
