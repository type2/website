Subject: Stock dual carb experiment

I tried something new with my stock Solex PDSIT carbs - I decided to 
disable the central idling system.
I turned the large volume control screw at the top of the left carb all the 
way in, so that no air could get past the large solenoid.  I also 
disconnected power from the large idle shutoff solenoid and replaced the 
two idle-jet solenoids with simple idle jets.  I also disconnected both 
chokes and set the choke plates so that they are always held 
vertical.  This way, I need NO electrical connections to the carbs at 
all.  I adjusted the throttle stops inward a few turns to set the 
idle.  I'm happy to report that the bus runs just fine this way.  I may run 
into trouble in the winter without the chokes, but now with the warm 
weather it is no problem.

Why did I do this?  I was tired of all of the headaches associated with the 
solenoids and electric chokes.  The mechanisms are fragile and 
trouble-prone, and I have spent more than my share of time and money trying 
to keep them in working order.
