Subject: Re: [T2] re: great jack

&gt;i couldn't use your link for that jack but what i use is an ATV jack from
&gt;harbor freight with a board on top, drops down to about 3 inches and works
&gt;quicker and safer than anything else i've ever used to pull an engine.

Motocycle/ATV jacks are really great for pulling and putting back the
engine.

I basically stripped the old engine and reassembled the new one (tin,
intake and exhaust etc) on such a jack. It allows you to easily access
the underside of the engine which is great for engines with
thermostats and exhaust ports on the underside.

The only problem is the cost (normally &gt;$100). I managed to find one
on offer at the local Kragen.
