Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Injection Pump wiring problem - Fixed

&gt;
&gt; &gt;If I remember right...as I am rotating the ALT bolt -the Exhaust- opens
&gt; &gt;first I think, then intake in/out, then I have to rotate it another 3
&gt; &gt;inches... nothing seems to move during these last 3 inches or so.

&gt; Sounds like 180 off then.
&gt; Remember:
&gt; Intake open, piston is pulled down.Fuel/air comes in.
&gt; Intake closes, piston comes up(Compressed fuel Mixture, TDC, fire).
&gt; Piston is pushed down.
&gt; Exhaust Valve opens, piston is pushed up. Exhaust releases.

John,

Reading your post and Michael's, I think you are thinking that TDC is when
#1 intake closes and that Michael is thinking (correctly) that TDC is when
#1 intake closes PLUS ONE HUNDERED EIGHTY DEGREES.

OOK!
