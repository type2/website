Subject: Re: Possible engine for the Bus

Hi!  

I've got a '72 Camper I'm trying to make purr.  It's got a strong 1700 with
the original Solex duals and I'd appreciate any thoughts on upgrades or
fixes that will increase it's power, efficiency or longevity.  I know about
changing the oil, warming the engine before driving and getting the valves
adjusted regularly, any other tips, gurus?  William mentioned upgrading the
ignition system...?
