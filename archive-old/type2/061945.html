Subject: Manassas Bug-Out is Sunday, 9/1 ONLY

Operating in neutral, as usual, I assumed that the bug out was a Sat-Sun
event as it has been in past years.  Turns out to be a SUNDAY ONLY event.
:-( Thus I will be camping out at Bull Run Regional Park for Saturday
night only. Any others who were planing to attend Saturday based on my
earlier post, Sorry.
