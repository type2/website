&gt; Porsche and Tatra shows what can be done with big $$$, VW limited to low

VW made incremental improvements to just about everything, but did make
some bonehead moves, almost always at the prompting of external
regulation.  things like EGR, throttle positioners, seatbelt interlocks,
key-in-ignition buzzers, etc. were not VW's idea.
