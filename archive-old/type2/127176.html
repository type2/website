Subject: RE: [T2] Starter Question (fwd)

&gt; The solution to your problem lies at:

I have to disagree steve.
do the starter troubleshooting first.
http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/starter.htm

then i think he will be replacing his intermittent starter.

the relay kit is useful is you have a problem with hot starting maybe
caused from the voltage drop in the wire combined with a slightly harder
to turn over engine and more current required. but this is just an
intermittent start problem.
i would check and clean up all of the connections first but my suspicion
tells me the starter contacts are not engaging and are just intermittent.
BTDT several times.

he could try to disassemble and clean up and lube the various parts of the
starter and solenoid and lube the bushing and then put it all back
together and see how it goes.
thats a lot of work. if you have lots of time and little money its a
thought.
i think its false economy though.
ron has brand new starters for 90.00 and takes just a few minutes to swap.
i suspect he will be replacing it eventually.

the relay kit is not a bad idea. probably wont solve this problem though.

cheers and good luck.
