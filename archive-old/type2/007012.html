Tim:
I recently went to a junkyard looking for retractable belts. The only usable 
ones I found were on a '93 Blazer. They work fine on the passenger's side but 
the driver's side is a tight fit where the retraction mechanism bolts down 
next to the seat rail. My driver's seat is frozen in place and when I get it 
broken loose I'm reasonably certain that moving it forward one notch will 
take care of the problem.
