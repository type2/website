Subject: Aluminium or Magnesium case for type 1

I'm seeking feedback on aluminium replacement type 1 cases - versus
new AS 41 replacement cases.

It would seem obvious that aluminium is a better choice, since it
lasts longer and VW actually used it starting with the type 4. I've
found two people (John Conolly and this list member who complains
about his &quot;crapcase&quot; who dislike the aluminium case)  but I did not
quite get why they are no good for type 1.

So anyone has aluminium case and likes it ?

- Arnaud
