Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Smell


Bo,
On my 78 2.0L FI I had the same symptom and found the problem to be weeping
fuel lines in the engine compartment. They develop small cracks/tears over time
and will allow just a little gas out when under pressure. Look very closely as
they may look OK upon a more casual inspection. There are many short pieces of
rubber tubing and they all need to be checked and I would suggest replacement
of all of them. Of course you might as well check all rubber fuel lines back to
the tank while you are at it. I do not know, but I suspect that this is one of
the causes of engine fires, so perhaps this is a ASAP situation.

Good Luck!
Cheers
Chris

&gt; I have a 79 2.0-L fuel injection Bus with a BN6 heater, and yesterday I
&gt; smelled gas when I was driving inside the vehicle.  I would smell it more
&gt; when the heat vents were on, but not at all when the BN6 heater was on.
&gt;
&gt; I would guess I need to check all the fuel lines for leaks.  Are there a lot
&gt; of fuel lines to check, and should I check other things?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
