Subject: 82 vanagon won't start...mystery

Well I have three Vanagons.  #1 sits up on ramps waiting for me to complete
the overhaul and reinstall engine and tranni.  #2 runs great but has an oil
leak and a nice bit of rust.  So #3 is my prestige car and I've been putting
all my efforts there.  #3 is an '82 Westi.  Everything was going fine.  Last
weekend I changed the fuel filter (which was badly plugged up) and changed
some fuel hose and some vacuum hose.  No problem...ran great, better than
ever.  Then on Tuesday it just stopped going...like the switch was off.  So
I had a friend tow me home and commenced the diagnostics.  Checked points
and timing and eventually changed to a known working distributor just for
good measure.  Checked fuel delivery is a little less than a quart at 30
seconds cranking. Haven't actually checked fuel pressure.  Ran  tests on all
pins at computer as per Bentley.  Double relay ok, but changed it out
anyway.  resitor block ok, Air flow meter tested out ok but changed it out.


The van will crank and run for maybe a second.  Like maybe the injectors are
leaking down a little into the manifold enough to run for a few seconds...So
I'm guessing the injectors aren't firing...BUT WHY OH WHY NOT?????

Any wisdom out there  for a poor seeker of truth?

John Jensen...three vanagons to make one run...but I love 'em
