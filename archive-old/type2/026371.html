Tyler,
	I like to use Permatex Aviation Gasket sealer.  It's purply black,
stays tacky, and comes off easily when you change them.  Try it out.

	Eron



I am doing this for the first time tonight. I searched through the archives
and
my Bentley manual and I am solid on the process. I just have one question.
Will
using a small amount of grease between the cork gasket and the cover (enough
to
just wet the cork) be sufficient to hold the gasket in place while putting
the
cover on or should I look to another product to ensure proper fit. The
grease I
have is the all-purpose Lithium based stuff.

Thanks,

Tyler Koyl
