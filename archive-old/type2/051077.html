Subject: Re: [T2] knob?

Hiya Michael,

That knob behind your right leg is for operating the floor heater vent just 
behind and between the two front seats.  It should pull out (heat is 
dispersed through the floor vent for second seat passengers) and push in 
(vent closed).

As for the electrical spaghetti behind the dash..............  if the PO was 
really playing around under there, who knows?  It could be most anything.  
But, in terms of VW factory color coding, a large yellow wire is most likely 
a lead to your headlight high beams on the driver side.  I'd guess that is 
not (if it is a headlight lead) causing your starting problem.  Were I you, 
I'd get a good wiring diagram for your Bus and trace the ignition circuit all 
the way through back to the starter making sure that all the connections are 
secure.  I'd bet that will solve your starting problem.  As to the mess under 
the dash...............
