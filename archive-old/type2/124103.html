Subject: Engine Compartment Wiring

Hey guys,

    I'm considering buying a complete wiring harness for my 73 VW Bus from
BustedBus. They sell refurbished wire looms. I believe the complete set for
the entire car is arond $200 bucks which is pretty reasonable.

I know that mine is a 73, but I currently have an 1800cc with a single 2bbl
webber progressive.
I have an electric fuel pump (Bug Pak / Purolator).

Is there any particular year that's better than another? Or should I just
stick with 73? I plan on basically re-doing everything if I can.


Thanks,

Todd,
