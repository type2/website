Subject: Re: Fuel milage going going gone.... Ideas?]

&gt; Hello Friends,
&gt; I dont know if its the rising fuel costs, the cold
&gt; winter air being denser and harder to push through or
&gt; (and I'm trying to avoid this) something wrong with my
&gt; 1978 fuel injected bus, but my milage seems to be
&gt; dropping. I remember getting around 20 miles while
&gt; cruising on highways and now even though I'm mostly
&gt; confined to the city, 15 mpg seems a little too kind
&gt; to the Kuwaities. Any thoughts or advice appreciated.
&gt; Aside from low compression what could be resposible
&gt; for the drop in economy?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Giles


I would consider 15 mpg to be good for winter city driving.  My guess is
that the majority of the posts will agree to me.

Wait until summer and compare summer highway cruising mileage to the
summer mileage you remember getting.

I never saw better than 17 in my '77 (unless I drove less than say 60mph)
while on longer trips.  Do not fret.
