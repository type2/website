Ooooh guys,

I hear gasoline is slated to get up near the $2.00/gallon mark this summer!
I don't know about the rest of you. but old Gus (78 passenger van) hauls
many folks for few $$$$$'s.  He also gets pretty good highway mileage when
he's permitted to go at 58 mph which is his &quot;happy speed&quot;. Wonder how many
of those kid hauling urban assault vehicles will be putting in overtime at
$2.00/gallon going to the soccer field.

Chris and Gus the &quot;Ja, I don't eat much, stay slim...&quot; Bus
