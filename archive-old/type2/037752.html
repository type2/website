Subject: WTB parts for my 68 crew

SunflowerList
It has been along time sense I have came out of the shadows and actually
wrote to the list as a whole. Though I do answer peoples troubles when I can
in personal email. So all of you that I have spoke with in the last 3 years
please back me up, I am not a complete lurker!!!
Anyway with that said I am hoping I can get some help from you all with some
parts I am looking for to complete my current project. I have a 68 crewcab
and am in need of a metal dash (I believe they it is called a European
standard dash). It is the one that have just the small amount of padding on
it, instead of being completely covered. I am also looking for a good set of
doors, preferably 68 so I don't have to drill for the locks.
Any help anyone? Also Please let me know if I can help you with any parts. I
have an extra rear seat pedestal for a crewcab and a set of gate handles
just to name a few things.
One last thing anyone have a set of hoops for a canvas canopy. I just want
to get the measurements off them to make my own. Of course unless you want
to sell yours.
Thanks in advance
