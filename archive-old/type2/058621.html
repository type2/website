Hello again fellow v-dubbers!

    Don't you just love P.O.'s?  Seems my '72 pancake-engined Riviera had an
especially creative one.  He must have been really bored one day and decided
he'd pass the time by taking a screwdriver or some equally damaging tool and
pounding out the identifying letters of the serial number on my engine.
    Two questions come to mind...
    One.   Why on earth would someone do this?   Stolen engine or something?
    Two.  Is there any other location on a pancake engine where the serial
number is stamped?  Or any other way to identify what I've got here?

Have a great Day!
