Well,
All I know is I bought it from a local VW supplier trying to reduce the
number of dead VW's due to fire.
http://www.mickmotors_dot_com.au/
Brand is : Airod who make fuel and LPG equipment.
It's a simple normally close solenoid with a valve and straight through line
for the fuel.
I mounted it near the tank outlet and ran a wire to it from the coil, so
it's only open when the motor's running.
It cost me ~$A50 and was an easy do it yourself install.
An added benefit is I ran the wire through a hidden switch as theft
protection. Even if they hot wire the bus, they only get as far as the fuel
in the carbs.
Richard,

&gt; If you have manufacturer's info, and other data about this, I'd really
&gt; like to look into what you did. Basically, who is the manufacturer,
&gt; where'd ya get it, how much did you pay, how did it install... you know
&gt; the usual list of questions.
&gt; 2 little kids strapped into car seats while gravity pulls gallons of
&gt; fuel onto a fire underneath them is keeping me up nights.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, to what I have done to minimise the risk of fire. I have fitted
&gt; &gt; a solenoid in the fuel line at the tank to cut fuel off when ignition
&gt; &gt; is off.
