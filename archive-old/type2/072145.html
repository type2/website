&gt;Obviously SOTO is a bust, so what other clubs out there are actually
&gt;producing a
&gt;newsletter.  ABC, Box on wheels??? Who?

One of the best club newsletters I have seen is from Bob Hufford
&lt;bhufford_at_mail.orion_dot_org&gt;.  Bob edits the newsletter for the Springfield MO
(no the Simpson's don't live there) VW club &quot;GROOVE&quot; and is one of the
driving forces behind the local bus group &quot;SAMBA&quot;.

There are many great reviews in the newsletter and even a toy report from
Jerry Jess each month.  Membership is $20 per year, worth it just for the
newsletter.
