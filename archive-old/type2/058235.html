Subject: Re: jerome - enough!

Enough?  please?  Posts announcing shows are fine, posts requesting
formation of caravans are fine, but as the charter says, &quot;theres a line&quot;
and I think we have arrived at, if not passed over, it.  

Also, If you have a complaint about a post, the proper address is *not*
the list;  it's me.  I am here and I do take requests.
