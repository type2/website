[...] I've never tried it myself but have heard that powder coating can be a
do-it-yourself project.  I think Eastwood may even have a kit for it.  The
hard part is talking your wife into use of the kitchen stove.

&gt; 
&gt; hello list.  i have recently been searching in my neck of the woods for
&gt; someone to powdercoat my rims.  unfortunately, i think at this point in
&gt; time it is going to be too expensive.  so, i was wondering if any
&gt; of you out there have painted your rims yourself.  please report on the 
&gt; materials you used as well as long term results. i really dont want the
&gt; paint to start chipping/flaking 6 months down the road.
