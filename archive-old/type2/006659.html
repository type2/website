Subject: 72 Westy for sale in Calif
Date: Fri, 20 Apr 2001 07:15:50 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Need to sell my Westy fast:
New Yellow paint on the bottom 1/2 of the bus, 1975 1.8 engine with single
progressive carb., straight body no rust, missing the icebox inside the
fridge but I have the fridge cabinet with sink and water tank, 50% tires,
poptop canvas has holes in screens and tears in canvas by hinges. I have
started reupholstering the seats in back with tan vinyl. Starting to become
a nice Westy, also new master cylinder. I'll be at the Red Barn tonight for
sale at $1875.00 firm.
