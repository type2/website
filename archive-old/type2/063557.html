Subject: Charging Westy Auxiliary Battery

I had to charge the main battery in my '77 Westy last week and found in
the process that the auxiliary battery is completely dead.

It appears the PO has changed the way the aux batt is charged. I don't
have a circuit diagram for this, but I would imagine the charging
current would come from the regulator somehow. The setup in my van
now is that there is a 2.5 amp trickle charger in the engine compartment.
Its positive voltage is fed to the aux batt. I'd like to restore the
aux batt charging back to stock.

How do I connect the aux batt back into the charging system?

Why would the PO want to use a trickle charger?
