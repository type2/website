&gt; Perhaps it had something to do with the storage of the engine before

maybe but not sure it would have that effect.

looking at the photos the scratches on the skirt of the one cyl is ???
 the pitting probably has no effect at all.

are the rings loose in their grooves??

in the 4th photo of the #2 piston in the left side just above the middle
there appears to be some blowby. or is it just the photo.



&gt; I've seen a loose head before, it had finger-tight nuts and the

doesn't have to be that loose though

&gt; blowby tracks were really easy to spot. This one is clean as a
&gt; whistle, and the nuts were plenty tight.

well this one also only has 1,000 miles on it too.

it sat an awfull long time I wonder how easily the pistons are moving
around on their rods.  still doesn't seem like it should have failed that
soon though.

now this engine in mine has more noises and unknowns than I can shake a
