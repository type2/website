What a hose job !!

He advertises parts for sale, receives the money, and now he is too busy
to get the guy his parts !

You are responsable, and obligated to get Eli, the stuff he paid for, as
soon as you got the money,  regadless of how &quot;busy&quot; you may be.

And don't even try to relate to the BD's situation.

Ron has his hands full, and this is a one time deal, and you can't even
get it handled.

Eli, contact your credit card institution, and file a stop payment on
this transaction.
