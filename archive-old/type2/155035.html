Subject: RE: [T2] More from Nokian North America

&gt; Discount Tire was able to pull through for me when I looked
&gt; for snow/ice tires with the proper load range when I owned
&gt; the Guac.  Like Richard said though, they aren't cheap. I
&gt; believe I was right around the $1k range for a set of 5


For those who need a good snow and don't have $200 a tire to invest, I have
about 10 of the Vredesteins available at $109 each. Exceed all Bus specs of
course (or I wouldn't sell them), and have an excellent reputation.
(Vredestein is an OEM supplier to VW, and is highly regarded for their snow
tires.) I use Vredestein snows myself and can confirm first-hand that they
are markedly better than any all-season tire in snow (even compared to the
Hankooks, which are great-season tires, but no all-season tire can compare
to a dedicated Snow). If you need snows this season, get 'em quick, as I
don't know if I'll see any more this winter.  Last winter I had 50 of 'em,
but Vredestein seems uninclined to import many reinforced 14&quot; tires these
days. :-(  I was originally told there would be none at all in the U.S. this
year, so under the circumstances I was happy to get even ten.
