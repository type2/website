...Of course it is cheaper in bulk. Everything is.

To my knowledge Q-pads aren't a &quot;Car Stereo&quot; product...haven't seen them 
offered with those *other* boom-box sound deadening pads. It is a auto 
manufacturer / Body shop product. You can get it typically at a body-shop 
supply house, or through Hurst.
