Subject: Brakes still broken: Clunk in vacuum assist ('76)
Message-ID: &lt;19990518135418.9408.rocketmail_at_web109.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

Hello list, I posted this problem 10 days ago and got no responses. 
Since then I swapped back in the original vacuum assembly and added new
hoses on both sides of the assembly -- not much changed.

Problem: There is a clunking sound in the brake pedal / vacuum assist
assembly when I drive over bumps.
I can stop the noise by riding the brake pedal, depressing it about 1
inch.  This suggests that there is slack in the pedal/vacuum assist
assembly, but I can't figure out how to eliminate it.

The problem arose after I replaced the following with new parts: all 4
rubber brake  hoses, rear cylinders, rear shoes, and rubber hoses
connecting to the vacuum assist assembly.  I also swapped in the
following from another van: front calipers, disks and pads, as well as
the master cylinder and vacuum assist assembly.  When the clunk
started, I swapped back in the original vacuum assembly, and the clunk
continued.  Could it be that I have a vacuum leak and the vacuum assist
doesn't retract all the way, leaving a gap between it and the brake
pedal pushrod?  Any thoughts?  This is driving me crazy.
