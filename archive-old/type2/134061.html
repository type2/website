Subject: Buses of the Corn - US Carabus

Hi,

Buses of the Corn is ONE WEEK AWAY and you would think I have started 
packing by now but I have been wasting time putting together a web 
page for the Mid Atlantic Carabus to BOTC !!!!!!

If you are heading to to Canada from the US, check out the web site. 
We may cross paths so if you are interested in joining us please 
e-mail me.

The web page is http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~macbus/

Thanks
Chris
