'79 Westfalia
Yesterday I wrote about a large oil leak apparently coming from my oil
cooler during initial startup following a complete engine rebuild.  Well,
after consulting both the Bentley manual (which has a detailed exploded
diagram) and the Haynes manual, I discovered that oil cooler installation
instructions in the (*$#^!)&amp;$#_at_)( Haynes manual are wrong.  Haynes states
(p39), and I quote &quot;Do not forget the washers between the cooler and the
crankcase&quot;.  My interpretation of this was that the thick aluminum washers
go between the oil cooler and crankcase.....right!?  That is precisely what
I did.  Bentley has a clear picture (p5-25) showing the thick washer, along
with a spring washer going under the nut.  Judging from the magnitude of my
oil leak, I'm assuming that Bentley is right, Haynes is wrong.  Any
comments?  I need to know the 'right way' to proceed here.

Thanks to Walter Wray, I was able to get the cooler off tonight without
pulling the engine, but it was a B!+¢|-|.  Its a good thing that all the
exhaust bolts were off recently.  Hopefully I'll find the time in the next
couple of days to get it back together.
