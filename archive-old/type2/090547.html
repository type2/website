Subject: stock radio

a previous owner unhooked the stock radio, perhaps to install after
market stereo. there is an alpine amp in the cabinet, not sure if it is
defective or PO didn't realize it was left in there. anyway, the radio
was in the dash, but all wires were unhooked. there are wires with
connectors hanging amongst the wires under the dash, but i don't know A)
do these wires even go to the radio B) if they do, which ones go where? i
looked at my wire diagram in that green manual, probably haynes, but it
doesn't list wires for a radio. help please???

on the plus side... i disassembled the licence plate light and made it
work ALL BY MYSELF!!! lol. still haven't figured out why the horn won't
work, though. checked the fuses... #1 was broken, but diagram shows horn
being #3. oh well, guess i will just have to yell out the window, lol.

leaving on a 6-8 hour drive after work tomorrow, across desolate kansas,
at night, without music to keep me awake!!!!
