Subject: Re: Fuel Filter Saga: Again

Travis:
the group mind need more input.
you will notice that generalized questions
net non-specific results. you have posed a
question to the late bus group, and so  we
are guessing that your fuel-injected type 4
was made in the seventies. (what year is it?)
(1.8/2.0 ?).
you mention &quot; no obvious disconnections&quot;
as your repair procedure. did you just look around,
or clean terminals ? or attempt a shaolin solution ?
the gas fllter saga should have included a
measurement of pressure and flow prior to
replacement. willy- nilly parts swapping is a
professional technique reserved for VW dealers
and full-time mechanics.
your problem here will ultimately be determined
to be &quot;electrical&quot; and the specific solution will be
to A) replace flow meter (preceeded by) impedence
measurement found in Bentley manual , and
found to be not restricted in flapper travel , or
B) replace temp sensor located  at cyl# 3 (tested
defective) or C) clean and tighten the brown ground
wire on the firewall near the double relay, which has
received a proper terminal scrubbing (shiny brass color. )
or D ) something else.....
