Hey!  I actually did that in my old bug in college! 
We used 3 milk jugs (that's how many fit in the cooler
I was using as a back seat) with windshield washer
pumps, and made a piece of wood that held three on/off
switches with tubes and spouts hooked up.  The premix
stuff used to last my friends about 3 or four days
before I'd have to refill the whole thing.  Worked
great for tailgating, and although I had no tailgate,
I had the best bar set up around!

&gt; &gt; So would it be legal to convert the windshield
&gt; washer reservoir to hold Jack
&gt; &gt; Daniels if the hose were routed to the cabin?
