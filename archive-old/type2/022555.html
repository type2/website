Please Help!!!
	71 dormobile with charging system trouble. I just bought this beast and
the previous owner installed a new generator, new volt regulator and wiringharness through out. Trouble is my battery keeps dying. I checked the
generator for voltage and it seemed fine to me. Could the voltage regulatorbe the trouble and not allowing the current to flow back to the battery? I
hope that it is because the wife would understand 30 bucks versus 130 for anew generator. New to VW's and becoming frustrated. The local mechanic
checked the charging system for free but I feel thats is all the info he isgoing to give me unless I pay the 55 bucks per hours for shooting wires.
Thank you.

Paul Saulsbury
