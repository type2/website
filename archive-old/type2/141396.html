&gt; &gt;I pressed a bunch of buttons,, and when I finally got sound..... the radio
&gt; &gt;station was playing Greatful Dead  , Magic Bus!   How appropriate!
&gt;
&gt; Jamie,
&gt; the next time you're down south, we need to have some remedial 60's
&gt; music appreciation. . . Magic Bus is a great tune but it was done by The
&gt; Who, not the Dead. . . enjoyed your great bus rescue TR. . .


Your right,, hanging my head,, That is why I can never find the song on a
Greatful Dead album!   D'oh !

2 people picked up that mistake!
