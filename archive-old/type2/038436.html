Subject: Bus Tires

I have a 77 Westy (lime green). Decided to buy new rubber, so I read 
everything anybody had to say about tires on type2. Armed with this info, I 
called my local tire guy and asked for 195/75R14 C tires with reinforced 
sidewalls.

He says he has a Toyo tire, grade C made for light trucks and SUV's. So he 
installs them today (great deal all 4 installed/balanced $210), I pick it up 
and I find the tires are not C rated. They turn out to be Toyo 185/75R14 
92S.

I confront him on this and he says they're C rated and have reinforced 
sidewalls.

According the Toyo_dot_com the tires specs are:
Ratings
UTQG Treadwear 380
UTQG Traction A
UTQG Temperature B
M and S Rated
Max PSI 35
Max Load 1400

Toyo's Description: The Toyo® M410 Open Country offers riding comfort and 
quiet performance for pick-ups, vans, and SUVs. Its shock-absorbing 
construction smooths out bumps in rough roads making it ideal for highway 
versatility.

Will these work or should I raise hell with him to switch them out? The were 
$35 less than the &quot;comparable&quot; Michelin tires. If so just run 'em at 35psi?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks! Marvin
