 Bus Questions:
 
 Does anyone have the height of a 73 westy with pop top? I am building a garage
and looking at a car lift. I was going to put in a low profile lift with no
beam going over the lift so that the bus would not have clearance issues. Then
I found a different lift, with the overhead crossbeam, for a much cheaper
price. I just want to make sure that the bus will not hit the cross beam when lifted.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Is this a Rotary lift? If yes, my 77 poptop Westy fits under the crossbar and goes all
the way up without hitting it. The Rotary also has a safety bar just below the crossbar
with a microswitch on it, if you hit the safety bar the lift stops rising. It stops before you hit 
the crossbar. You might check what safety features your new one is offering if it is 
not a Rotary.
