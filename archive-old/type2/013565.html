I have for sale a 1980-1987 Bentley repair manual for
the VW Vanagon and Westfalia Vans. This manual covers
repair for all engines used in the vanagon including
both air and water cooled.  Asking $50 plus shipping.

Also have a new unused dual relay for the type IV
engine.  Relay is used to supply power to the fuel
pump. Purchased in Dec. and spent $85, yours for $40
plus shipping.

If interested Email me at txl1star_at_hotmail_dot_com
