Subject: Re: [T2] Re-calibrating AFM?

Hey Tim,
Yes, loosening the spring does richen the mixture because it sets the 
flap farther open for any given airflow.

However, if you'd really like to get a hold of your fuel mixture, throw 
away the AFM and get a megasquirt.  I messed with that stupid flap for 
years and it drove me nuts.  Plus, the contacts wear out which is an 
added head-ache.  There are alot of band-aid fixes, and yeah, you can 
get a rebuilt AFM, but it costs the same amount for a MS.  Granted I 
like to fiddle with everything so one little flapper door wasn't enough 
for me ;)  Anyways, with the MS you can tune it to your heart's content 
and you can see if your mixture is running rich or lean (o2 reading).

Now, if you don't want to go the megasquirt route, but would still like 
to see your mixture, aircooled_dot_net sells a nice o2 meter that will put 
you in the general ballpark.  It's nothing like WB02 (which 
ultramegasquirt will have - aw yeah!), but it is helpful.

&gt; Hi All:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm aware of the implications of adjusting the spring tension on the 
&gt; AFM, and that everyone says not to mess with it.  From what it looks 
&gt; like to me, the way you perform this adjustment is by rotating the gear 
&gt; shaped piece that holds the tension spring.  Therefore reducing tension 
&gt; would result in a richer mixture and increasing tension would result in 
&gt; a leaner mixture.  Am I correct?
