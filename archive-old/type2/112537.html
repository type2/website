Subject: master cylinder?

Has anyone ever tried to rebuild there own master cylinder? I was going to 
attempt to rebuild the one for my project bus but the only rebuild kit (VW 
dealer) was almost as much as an already rebuilt one. Any clues on where to 
look for a kit? I'm really not sure if that is a normal price for a rebuild kit 
or not. 

Also after taking the snap ring off of my master cylinder the thing still won't 
come apart, any suggestions.
