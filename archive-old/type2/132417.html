Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Price ??? What do you think

Hi Matt,

That sounds like a reasonable price, but it depends a LOT on the 
quality of the components. It isn't impossible to spend more than that 
on body/paint alone to repair a lesser bus.

Find out what the owner considers a rebuilt motor. Some people consider 
a cylinder head replacement to be a motor rebuild. Did they use new 
parts or re-use the old stuff. Did it come with a warranty? Did the 
motor come from GEX???

It's easy to pump $5K into a newly acquired bus getting it back into 
good condition. If you start with a good condition bus you CAN save a 
lot of this expense, but you have to shop carefully. There are people 
who luck out and don't pay as much as Mr. Hineline.


Happy trails,

&gt; I am looking at a stock 1971 bus, in Good condition. Advertised as

&gt; getting $3,000 for it. This is a California bus, and looks to be in
&gt; Good/Great condition.
&gt; So, Is this a 'good' price for this bus, or am I thinking of putting 
&gt; too
&gt; much out?
