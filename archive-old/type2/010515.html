&gt; Checked my newly painted white Westy this morning and found the

&gt; multiple egg tosses. What's the best way to remove the egg stains
&gt; without
&gt; messing up the new paint job?
&gt; BILL

Popular wisdom is to soak the egg stains with detergent solution, then
with ammonia solution, and then to soak any remaining stains with
detergent that contains enzymes.

Good luck!
