Hi all,
    Ok, so I've had two valve seats drop this month.  #3 exhaust 3 weeks ago
and the #1exhaust last week.  Besides the #1 my compression ratios were
still very good when i checked them yesterday.
#1.) 2
#2.) 125
#3.)118
#4.)135

Maybe a little off balance, but the real question is this.  A local shop has
recommended that i use nickel seats and diesel valves when i have *all my
valve jobs done at once*.  Has anyone heard of nickel seats?? Any
experience??  I really want to eliminate this valve trouble I've been
having.
TIA

Word,
Isaiah Smith
