Subject: Exhaust Screw back in place

hey now,

i borrowed a screwdriver and was able to get the exhaust screw back in. running
fine now. my worry now is what i can do to prevent this from happening again.
is this something that i need to drop the engine and get to the head to fix?

thanks,

jonathan
