I got this info from VDO and thought some of you may also find it useful


How To Check 300 degree Oil Temp Sender

Disconnect wire from sender.

Check the resistance between the terminal and ground


322 Ohms =  120  Degrees
105 Ohms =  180  Degrees
64 Ohms =   210   Degrees
35 Ohms =  250    Degrees
18 Ohms =  300    Degrees
