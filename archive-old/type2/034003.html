Subject: Re: Grab Handle for Terrified Passenger

&gt;What came to mind was to be sure NOT to put the handle where 
&gt;your passenger's arm would interfere with the mirror during transit,
&gt;assuming you have a right side mirror.

Good point!!  I can see it now....  
Emergency maneuver required and I can't see out the mirror so I yell at my
passenger, &quot;Get your stupid arm out of the way!&quot;  
Passenger: &quot;No way!  If I do, I'm going to be flung out of my seat.&quot;  
Me: &quot;If you don't, I'm going to fling you out of your seat!&quot;  
Passenger: &quot;See why I don't want to let go and move my arm?&quot;

I'll keep it in mind when I get around to doing it.  Thanks and Happy
Holidays!
