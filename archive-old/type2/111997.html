&gt; The hazard flashers on my '76 aren't working.  The hazard circuit was a
&gt; little more visually complicated than I expected.
&gt;
&gt; In any case, the symptom is:
&gt;
&gt; 	- right and left turn signals work as expected
&gt;
&gt; 	- when the hazard knob is pulled to the &quot;on&quot; position,
&gt; 	  the dashboard turn signal indicator lights up solid,
&gt; 	  but the lights don't flash.
&gt;
&gt; All of the wires appeared to be hooked up correctly, but I'll
&gt; double-check them again.

That is always a good idea.  The most important terminals on the hazard
flasher switch to check are 30, 31, and 15.  Check terminals 30 and 15
with a voltmeter between the terminal and the body of the bus.  Terminal
30 should have 12V whether the key is on or off.  Terminal 15 should have
12V when the key is on only. Terminal 31 should be checked with an
ohmmeter or continuity checker. It should have no reistance or perfect
continuity to the body of the bus.

I will bet that you have no power on terminal 30 and that your interior
lights are not working.  If this is so then look in your fuse box as one
of your fuses has blown.  If replacing the fuse fixes the problem then you
are done.  Uusually there is a problem with the wiring for the interior
lights and a new wire needs to be pulled.  This is a ticklish operation
and many people choose to put it off and simpy disconnect the light
circuit from the fuse block.

&gt;
&gt; My questions are:
&gt;
&gt; 	- do the hazard flashers use the same flasher relay
&gt; 	  that the turn signals so, or does it include its
&gt; 	  own relay in the switch (this is kind of what it looked
&gt; 	  like, to me)

They do use the same relay but they use different power sources.

&gt; 	- anyone else encountered the above symptom before?

I have seen this before.  No emergency flashers and no interior lights is
a classic symptom to me.  I replace the fuse and look for trouble in the
interior lights.

                             OOK!
