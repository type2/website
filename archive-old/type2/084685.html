&gt; &gt; Nothing will be more functional than the very

&gt;'Commercial', ie sidewalls like on a
&gt; &gt; Peterbuilt), it's not spec.

the same thing.  I've never seen both
&gt;designations on the same tire (which does not
&gt;mean that it doesn't exist!)
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, they do exist.  My last set of Cooper
&gt;Mastercraft R/D (same as Cooper SRM) were 195/14C
&gt;but load range D with a max load of 2000+ lbs.
&gt;The sidewalls were very stiff and the ride and
&gt;handling was a VERY VERY DRASTIC improvement over
&gt;the passenger all seasons that were on the
&gt;vanagon.

That's why they're spec. T-II's don't handle cross winds nearly as good 
without them. In this case, spec tires means FAR BETTER results than just a 
step down to lesser specs. It's the difference between night and day. The 
ultra stiff sidewalls of the commercial rated tires are not optional if you 
want it to handle as intended by the Meanereers who designed it.
