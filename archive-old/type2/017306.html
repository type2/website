Subject: Gear Calculator

   Somebody told me to look at the CB Performance website for a gearing
calculator, and they've got a pretty good one -- runs in Netscape, so
you don't need windoz -- and it's easy to copy it to your hardrive. Just
go to the URL, make sure that you are clicked on the actual frame
containing the calculator, then go to File, then Edit Frame, then when
the Edit window comes up, do a Save As to your harddrive.   8-)
