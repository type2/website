Any vehicle that has set for 10 years will require for safety and function:

Replace fuel hoses, pump, injectors and all brake and clutch hydralics and
hoses. Expect leaks from all oil seals as well, both engine and trans. The
only use harsher on components than extended non-use is all out at LeMans.
I would consider pulling the tank well for inspection and cleaning and of
course a new filter is in order.

After that is done, then you can go on to diagnose other items. You have a
very small chance to get this long sitting vehicle going without
replacement of many items.
