Subject: 914 engine

&gt;List,
&gt;Have i seen pictures of a 911 or a 914 engine in a bus on the web? I &gt;thought i had.  I searched the archives for a
&gt;while and couldn't find anything - does anyone have a picture of this?
&gt;thanx,
&gt;c.gordon


Check my site  http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/typeIV.html and there are some
links there to Nextgen and Sharpbuilt with 914 (typeIV) engines and
typeIV with 911 style air shrouds.

Hope this helps

Scott
