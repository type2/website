Subject: Re: [T2] Frustration in Florida

i am at that point of major repairs.  i thought about getting another car for 
a little while (very little while), but in the end i will have a great runing 
car that i will know how to mantain and fix it, and that, to me, is much 
better than buying some $5000 used car, that seems to be perfect until it 
breaksdown and you dont know what to do. 

77 green bus(no rust chicago car) soon to have new 2000cc type IV with 
hydrualic vavles and fuel injection
