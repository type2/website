Subject: [T2] drill press for sale/trade/whatever

Gentlepersons (in the Northern NJ area)-
Champion no. 1200 three speed (on the tree, no less) drill press (bench model)
Age: Makes your bus look young...
Price: Negotiable to the Nth degree....Trade for something VW, something 
interesting?
Does it work? Actually quite well, but I've got a Walker Turner now, and I 
need the
space. 
Why N. NJ? C'mon this sucker weighs in at about 75 or so lbs. Forget 
shipping.._dot_cast
iron construction.
