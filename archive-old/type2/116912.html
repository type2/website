Subject: Negative battery terminal on a 72

 Could someone tell me where the negative battery terminal was mounted to on
the body on a 72 bus? And send a pic of possible :-) While reassembling my
72 after and buying a new battery I noticed there was no negative battery
terminal. Not sure if was originally mounted someplace where I repaired the
body. I looked on my 73 parts bus and it is mounted to the wall in front of
the battery where the gas filler neck is. I did no repair in the area on my
bus, but there is no negative wire or a place where there was one (like a
bolt hole or something).  Can someone look on their 72 and tell where the
proper mounting place is? I suppose I could just drill a hole and mount one,
but I'd like to put it where it is suppose to go for a 72 if possible. Pic
of my battery compartment -&gt;
