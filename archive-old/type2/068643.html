Subject: RE: 8 volt battery in 6 volt bus

Thanks to everyone who responded to our earlier post 
about using an 8 volt battery in a 6 volt bus.  It 
seems the previous owner might earn a few points back 
for having used one.  We may move to a 12 volt system
at some point, but not now.  

It seems we can go ahead and use a 6 volt charger on it.
One person sugested we could even use a 12 volt charger,
but not for long.  

We've been considering buying a spare battery (I guess
an 8 volt, if we can find one) b/c we figured we'd
not be able to jump the 6 volt if we ever needed to.
Is this true - or could a (modern) 12 volt car be used
to jump a (not so modern - i.e. 1962) 6 volt bus?

We may post another thread about this - but can anyone
tell me if they know where one can buy the idle control
valve and choke element for a 6 volt system?  We may
want to replace our carb (it is a 30 PICT1, not original
for a 1962 I gather), but the places we've looked into so 
far seem to indicate that the 6 volt versions of these are 
no longer available.  Does anyone know of a source for them?

Thanks again to all those who responded to the previous post.

Brian and Stephanie
