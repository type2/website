&gt;There is a marking on the tops of the valves that marks them as being
&gt;sodium filled. This is important to shops that grind valves. Sodium
&gt;filled valves cannot be ground, if memory serves.

That's what I've heard too.  The mark on top of the valve is like a small
dimple right in the center of the valve.

&gt;The valve stem is solid, but the head of the valve is hollow, and, as
&gt;the name implies, is filled with sodium crystals. As the valve heats up,
&gt;the crystal phase changes (correct me if the term is incorrect), and
&gt;this helps keep the exhaust valve running cooler. The valve heads tend
&gt;to expand more than solid heads, thus the slightly greater clearance.

That's not exactly how I remember it.  :-)
The stem is hollow, and the head of the valve is solid.  The stem is filled
with sodium, which is, if I recall, a very soft solid at room temperature.
At normal engine operating temps it becomes a liquid, and the reciprocating
motion of the valve lets the sodium circulate heat from the head of the
valve where it is hottest, through the stem to the retainer and spring,
where it is cooler.  The sodium filled valve does not expand more or less
than any other valve, and I don't think that's why the exhaust is supposed
to be set to .008&quot;.  If anything, the sodium filled valves should be able
to handle .006&quot; better than solid valves because they run cooler.

&gt;When I was first learning to repair cars, our shop teacher told of
&gt;horror stories of grinding these valves. Having your grinding equipment
&gt;suddenly explode could ruin your whole day. Maybe someone can fill in
&gt;the details about grinding sodium filled valves. They aren't explosive,
&gt;are they?

I think pure sodium can explode when exposed to the atmosphere.  My
chemistry teacher in college kept the sodium immersed in oil.
