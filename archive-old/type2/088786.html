&gt; quoth Vanagon Man:
&gt;   Check endplay before you do
&gt; anything during the teardown...........that would give you a fairly good
&gt; indicator of what your main bearings are all about.

&gt;  I did see movement (in
&gt; out) in the thrust bearing and thought this was related.

If the thrust bearing moves, it is not clamped in the case,
and the dowel pin hole is oval. You need to have the
case align-bored and thrust cut. Now.
