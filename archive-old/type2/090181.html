Subject: Re: [T2] star adjuster clips

&gt; You can replace the backing plate.  It will have new clips on it, I think.
&gt; $99/pair at Bus Depot.   You can buy a used clip from BustedBus for $5.  I
&gt; am not sure how it gets attached, some kind of rivet.  I worry about this
&gt; happening to me too, so far it has not happened yet.

I remember awhile back that Erin rigged up functional clips from metal
banding material he grabbed at the lumber yard. I dont remember if he had
pictures or not but a description should be in the VB archive.
