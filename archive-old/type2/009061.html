Next time u change your plug wires, keep one of the long hard celluloid boots
that fit on the plugs.  Use your spark plug wrench (one with a &quot;T&quot; handle and
a universal joint available from 'Big-Lots' for about 2 bucks) to break the
plug free. Leave the plug in the cylinder, remove the wrench.  Push the boot
down over the plug tip and gently turn the plug out of its socket. 
Installation reverse of removal.  - put the boot down over your new plug and
hand-thread the plug into its hole until u can pull the boot off and finish
the job with your handy-dandy cheapo spark plug wrench.  Been doing this all
weekend.  Works great.  No dropped plugs!
