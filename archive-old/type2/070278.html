Subject: Re: '77 Camper - I own one now!

&gt;I just bought a '77 Camper. I was looking over the Bus summary FAQ 
&gt;and I think it might not be a '77.
&gt;
&gt;The reason I say this is that the window on the sliding door 
&gt;slides open, its not one of those crank jobs with
&gt;the small windows slats.

All Westfalia campers thru '79 had the crank-open jalousy window on 
the sliding door.  Even in '79, the bus had a sliding window on the 
sliding door, but the camper did not.  I suspect someone changed 
the window (or the sliding door) on your bus.
