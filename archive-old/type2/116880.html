Subject: Re: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

Bob Bailey's article was nice but I feel mis-represented by it, and I fear 
the attitude he associated with my paraphrased quotes is not only innacurate 
but may have led to the thread that some careful and sensitive readers 
consider &quot;Hippie-bashing&quot;.  To start with, I was raised in the woods by 
Mother Earth News reading back-to-the-land farmsteaders in the early 70's.  
I grew up immersed in Hippie culture, and still consider the ideals of that 
era to be the foundation of my personal values.
The commment I made to Bob when he interviewed me had to do with the 
post-70's tendency to dismiss the ideals of the Hippie generation by 
associating it with the surface kitsch of tie-dyes, VWs, stoned kids, etc.  
The entire premise of my project, and my motivation for making it, is a huge 
need to see justice done to the Ideas that came from that culture and 
changed our world for the better.  There were many good solutions presented 
to major problems that we as a society are still facing, yet we tend to blow 
off these ideas universally because they are associated with a movement that 
we have been taught to make fun of.  I think Muir's book is a great example 
of actualizing some of the best ideas of this period, and as effective as it 
is in the world of VWs, I want people who are not interested in VWs to 
benefit from it as well.

Peace,
Sean Solowiej
