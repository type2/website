&gt; Are there any tricks to reinstall the dipstick boot without taking the fan
&gt; housing and all off?  Just got the engine back from mechanic and replaced my
&gt; tin and went to replace dipstick and it wouldn't go.  Look under to see why
&gt; and one side of the dipstick boot is off.  The top if it matters.  Any
&gt; ideas?  I can't find the procedure or mention of it in Bentley and don't
&gt; really want to take it all back apart if I don't have to.. :(
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any ideas..

Heat it up in hot water - it makes it more flexible and therefore easier to
install.
