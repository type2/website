Subject: Rust!

Hello all,
  My Bus has a cracked windshield that can't be repaired, it has to be replaced. There is a bit of rust beneath the windshield and it extends under the rubber a little. So I figure I should do somethin about the rust before the glass goes in. So here's the real question. Since I plan on getting a resto-quality paint job on it in say, a year or so, what would be the best method of attack on the rust? I don't wanna do a half-arsed job, but I don't wanna go over board either. The rust is bad enough that it will require some body work to get her cherry. But for now, I want to arrest the rust.

Thanks,
JJ
