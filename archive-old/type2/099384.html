Subject: Back Window leak

List, 

Got a leak inside the back window of my 71 Westy. The rubber seal looks
brand new, one of the best rubber pieces on the bus. Can't figure this out.
Is their anything I can do besides change the seal? I could see changing it,
if I could see that it was old, torn, worn and all that. 

Is a new rubber seal my best bet here to remedy the problem. 

Thanks, 

Trey
