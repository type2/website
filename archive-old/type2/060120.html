&quot;Urge&quot; my 71 westie is to the point in the rustoration that she is ready for
finish work and paint. Right on! 

It has been a long road. Everything will be stock as she sits, but my dream
has been to get a special paint job for her. Thinking about the sticker from
&quot;Tribal Ink&quot; of the splitty with the roses down the side. Many of you have
seen it I'm sure. I want it to look 3D as if the roses are suspended around
the bus. Look at the cover of Hot VWs April 98 for an idea of what I want. 

Any ideas on how to find an artist to do the job?  I do not think it will hurt
the value of the bus as I can not imagine her ever being sold (even if I died
today -- many of you have met my kids :-)  )

Another question: Seems like I saw a thread about using super strength Velcro
rather than the standard way to replace the top canvas. Where did that lead?
Seems like a great idea to me as could be pulled off to clean, and a
hellofalot easier to do???

BTW, the 65 deluxe hard top I was thinking about buying to part out might be
saved! A listee wants to look at her as she is. We will see. Will be a big
job, but may keep one more on the road!
