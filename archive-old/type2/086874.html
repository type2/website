I have to vouch for the high speed of service when you need it, I never
seem to be able to figure out everything I'm gonna need for a job before I
start and have used the &quot;gotta have it now&quot; service more than once, and
they have a 100% come through for me, and once when I REALLY needed a part
I drove 5 hours each way to pick up a $3 part and they had it sitting
there waiting for me when I got there..not perfect no one is but they sure
beat anyplace else I've tried

of course YMMV


&gt; &gt; I needed a clutch this weekend so I can drive again! ...
&gt; &gt; I have used many of the online stores, probably all of them. Nobody
&gt; &gt; mentioned GoWesty in this thread but they are the only ones who had what I
&gt; &gt; needed in house and could ship it today. I have found lots of places say
&gt; &gt; they have to get it in and it would be at least 2 days before they could
&gt; &gt; ship it. GoWesty is a shop too so they have a lot of stuff right there.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; They have a lot of stuff (go-westy), but their prices are waay to
&gt; &gt; high. Bus Depot has always had what I needed and at the best price.
&gt; &gt; Just my   $.02
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Just a note that we DO offer same-day shipping, combined with next-day,
&gt; second-day, or third-day air delivery, upon request, on anything we stock
&gt; (of which a clutch kit is definately one; we have at least 30 on the shelf
&gt; at any given time!)  We can also do the same with thousands of items that we
&gt; don't have in stock, as long as one of our distributors has it and can drop
&gt; ship it for us same-day.
&gt; 
&gt; If you order via standard ground delivery, you will be quoted 7-10 working
&gt; days delivery, and it may take a day or two for the item to ship. But if you
&gt; ask for Expedited shipping you'll have the item in 1-3 days and it will ship
&gt; same day as long as you call by mid-afternoon.  (Expedited ordering is best
&gt; done by phone.) The cost of 3-day shipping is often just slightly higher
&gt; than ground, particularly on items that are not too heavy.  (On heavy items,
&gt; like a clutch kit, the price difference could be small or large depending on
&gt; destination.)  Frequently, the extra shipping cost is more than offset by
&gt; our lower parts prices.
&gt; 
&gt; If you need a part in a hurry, that's the way to go.
