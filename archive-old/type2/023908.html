&gt;       Well, after 1120 miles on my new rear 225/75R15 tires, I've got
&gt; one real definite thing to say --- DON&quot;T!
&gt; Not in less you've got a lot more power than my 2.0L w/FI engine. Or a
&gt; lower final drive ratio. My tranny, with a 4.86 ring and pinion, and a
&gt; .81 (or maybe it's .82) 4th, just won't pull those big tires. Bummer!

Hi all,
I have to strongly agree with this although in creating my Baja Bus site
I've spoken to quite a few Aussies that have had no problems with 30x9.5
tires on the back of a 2.0lt Bus.  Saying this it's not everyone that'll
admit they made a mistake with thier choice ;)

If you want to know more about gear ratios and tall tires etc then checkout
my Baja Bus site at http://www.baja_dot_com/Kombi there's also a link to a site
that has a gear ratio calculator as well as a chart showing rpm at given
speed for both the 1600 transaxle and the 2.0lt transaxle to give you an
idea of the affect of 3 different height tires.

My bus is running 235/75/15 tires on the back but is also running a 4.4lt V8
and a transaxle with custom ratios (taller final drive, not lower, I have a
ton of torque), this is one of the few ways you can run the tall tires and
still get the versatility a Bus has to offer.

Hope this helps a few
Cheers
