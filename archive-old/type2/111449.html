&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I'm concidering a T2 for my family holidays.
&gt; I have 2 kids; 2,5 years old and 5 months old.
&gt; Can I safely transport my kids in a T2 camper ?
&gt; There a no seatbelts in the back. Is there a solution for this ?


Hard points for seat belts are there, all you need do is install the
belts.

I've carried my daughters in my bus for their entire decade of life with
no worries.  Just drive as if your life depends upon it!
