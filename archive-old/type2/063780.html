Subject: FS post 68' splash pan (update!)

I have been told that the &gt;68 &quot;splash plate&quot; that I posted 
FS by a friend is way overpriced (thanks thom :), so if 
anyone is interested in it, please lemme now and i think I 
could convince him to lower the  price (a lot?)

if anyone is interested please contact me, i don't wanna be 
tripping over this thing for long..

m.
