Subject: Downshifting Bad?

Hi group

It seems that frequent downshifting on steep declines &gt;may&lt; produce unburned 
gas to seep into the cylinder wall and wind up in the crank case, doing 
terrible things to the affected friction surfaces.
In a 76 2000cc F.I. can this happen or does the foot off the accelerator stop 
the fuel injectors from pulsing and spraying gas, thereby avoiding the above 
problem.
Those of you living in mountainous areas please advise. What works best for 
you?
Also at what rpm is it safe to use the engine for braking?
Going to the hills soon, gotta know.
Thank you
Bucket
