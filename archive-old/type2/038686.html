sara: on the engine, #3 cylinder is to front of van,
#4 is to rear of Van.
noise is always a concern. you describe a clacking,
i hear valves. your hydraulic camshaft has hydraulic
valve lifters, filled w/oil, which can collapse. (clack)
you can drive 2 miles w/ this problem.
another  repetitive noise could be a spun rod bearing
which is serious and the engine should only be started
for a quick diagnosis, by someone you trust.
the ignition wire should be checked. 
the oil on spark plug should be sourced. a pint replaced
is careful and proper attention and not the cause for
any damage listed above. keep a piece of fresh 
cardboard under the engine overnight. the spots help
to source leaks.

Don't drive until you solve the dilemna ! ...Dave...
