To all the volks friends in the list:

Hi!,  all though I know  (perfectly well) that it is prohibited to talk in the list other
language than type2's, I feal in the need of showing to other VW entusiasts no matter
what they drive, what others are doing around the world with their vans/cars.

Here in Venezuela I work in the shipping bussines, specially in an agency representing an
international PUER CAR CARRIER company (the best in the Gulf and US East side coast).
By the end of October/98 ,  we broght a van that belonged to a middle age coulple that
wanted to go to Tierra del Fuego-Chile (the end of the world).  The van was nothing but a
SYNCRO camper (much like the one shown on page 48 &amp; 49 of this month VW Trends Mag.but
brown color and no pop-top but a big tall roof).

An interesting thing is, that they carry with them a Lap-top and have allready recived
some mail from them about their trip.   I wish (very proudly if you let me say it this
way) to show to all of you what they have writing.  You not only can do this on a Syncro,
we have had clients that have done the same trip on a 4x2 van and Toyotas.  I my self
have a next door neighbor that has a 73 Westy camper and have done the trip three (3)
times untill he desided to make his fourth trip on a converted camper on a 4x4 long
chasis Ford Pick-up with a 4Cyl. ISUZU Diesel engine.    If any of you deside some time
to think in doing this trip, I can assist you in Venezuela and even give you some web
pages of people that have done the trip before even two or three times.

Thanks for the attention and regret if this is too long.

Greetings Pedro,
We have completed a loop of some of the sights of Venezuela and are now in
the process of working our way down the Northeast coast of Brazil.

Thank you for your suggestions of the sights to see in Venezuela. We saw most
of them and really enjoyed the variety and beauty of Venezuela.

 I thought the drive between Merida and Barinas was especially scenic. Much
more so than the drive into Merida from the opposite direction. We took the
cable car ride and walked between a couple of the stations through the trees.
Really nice but I think we were the only ones that did it. Nobody else on the
trail.

A tour group owner told us to go with Tomas Bernol to see Angel Falls. He is
a Peruvian Indian who has lived for 30 years next to the falls and knows them
better than about anyone else. The location of his overnight camps are in the
best locations. We could see Angel Falls from our hammocks.

Because it was the rainy season, we could take a boat up to the foot of the
falls. Very impressive, so much water shooting off the top of the falls. A
photograph does not do the falls justice. You could place two photographs of
waterfalls next to one another and they would look similar even though one
falls may be 3 times as high.

We also enjoyed the Gran Sabana area. Our favorite waterfalls were not the
highest or those with the most power or flow. Jasper Falls is only about 3
meters high and 50 meters wide but the creek bed is a sheet of red jasper --
absolutely beautiful in the sunlight. Another favorite formed a great swimming
hole under the falls.

The road between Venezuela and the Amazon River is now completely paved so we
had a lot easier trip than we anticipated.

We hope all is well with you and your family.
Wayne and Jean Andreen

I forgot to mention that we spent a couple nights at Henri Pettier National
Park. We really enjoyed the variety of birds. We even had hummingbirds perch
on our fingers as they fed from the feeder.

&gt;
&gt; Greetings Pedro,
&gt;         I am sorry I have been so slow with the e-mail but I have been having problem
&gt; with the computer battery and making the e-mail connection. I just noticed
&gt; that the laptop power adapter can handle both 110 and 220 v so I am now
&gt; plugged into an outlet overlooking a small falls just north of Los Angeles (no
&gt; not California, but Chile).
&gt;
&gt; First congratulations of your VW van. We hope it is giving you the service
&gt; that we have received from ours. I guess you must be getting ready for your
&gt; trip to Boa Vista  (Brazil) over Easter. If you do go there, be sure to stop at Jasper
&gt; Falls in the Gran Sabana. We think that is a special falls. Never have seen
&gt; anything like it.
&gt;
&gt;         Boa Vista is a strange town. We had to ask directions just to find the city
&gt; center. When we did arrive at city center, it appeared to be deserted.
&gt; Buildings boarded up, very few people around. We were later told that this was
&gt; a result of the Brazilian government responding to international pressure.
&gt; Gold miners were overrunning land that belonged to the Indians while the
&gt; government ignored the cries for help. The miners killed several Indians and
&gt; the Indians responded when they had the opportunity. Our guidebook said we
&gt; would have to travel in convey over a portion of the road between Venezuela
&gt; and Manaus. I thought that was an over statement but tour busses had been
&gt; stopped by the Indians and some of the passengers killed. Anyway about 40000
&gt; miners were supposedly evicted from Indian land and this caused an economic
&gt; collapse in Boa Vista.
&gt;
&gt;         We reached the &quot;end of the world&quot; near the end of January. The &quot;end&quot; being
&gt; Ushuaia where the road ends. But we continued south, a Russian research ship
&gt; converted to passenger use, reduced their normal fare to Antarctica by almost
&gt; half in order to fill up the ship. It was too good of an opportunity so we
&gt; signed on. It was fantastic! It seems strange to be impressed by ice and
&gt; penguins but the Antarctica is a beautiful place. Our ship used rubber zodiac
&gt; boats to make 14 landings. We could explore islands and penguin colonies. The
&gt; penguins had no fear of us. They would look at us, cock their heads from side
&gt; to side as if to determine what type of penguin we were. We really enjoyed
&gt; watching them.
&gt;
&gt;         Another special treat was backpacking the &quot;circuit&quot; in Torres del Paine
&gt; National Park. It took us 8 days. From huge field of daisies, to rivers,
&gt; glaciers, mountains. A most gorgeous place.
&gt;
&gt;         We are now working our way up coast of Chile. We will return to Argentina
&gt; above Santiago and continue north to Bolivia.   The Syncro has been pretty good. The
&gt; gear shift rod broke twice and the front  left drive axle fell off. I was able to make
&gt; temporary repairs until final  repairs were made in town. My tires really got chewed up
&gt; over so many hundreds  of miles of gravel road so I bought 6 new ones at the free port
&gt; in Chile.
&gt;
&gt;         We hope everything is going well for you and your family.
&gt; Take care of yourself.
&gt;                 Wayne and Jean Andreen
