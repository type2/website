X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

All,
 Below listed are dates in July for a weekend of events in
July. Many Volks come from Canada, Oregon, California etc
etc. At Springmeet I said I would attempt to find a area to
camp fairly close to the College and pass the info on to
those coming from these far flung locations.
  Is there anyone out there that can point me in the
direction of a area to camp that is in the North end of
Seattle... the closer to Shoreline Com. Col. the better.
The College no longer tolerates anyone spending the night
there. All tips are welcome!.

The pertronix drop in points replacement system.
1) eliminates the condensor.
2) Mech advance unit comes with a full circle
mounting base.
3) Vac advance unit comes with a half moon (roughly)
shaped mounting plate.
4) the mech advance unit will not fit in a vac advance
dizzy due to the mechanism that takes up half of the
dizzy.
5) The Unit's base mounts to the exsisting plate in your
dizzy useing the same attach points as the points assembly.
It comes with a fairly thick, plastic gap gauge. DO NOT
HOOK IT UP BACKWARDS as it will fry. Also take care to use
the thick gap so that the sensor doesnt contact the
doughnut that goes under the rotor. This will overheat the
sensor and it will die.

Television - a medium. So called because it is neither rare nor well-done.
