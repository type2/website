Subject: No gas up hill

Hello Volks

I have been silence for a long time now due to many diferent things, but I am
still reading the list on regular basis to improve my knowlege from you all.
This time I calim for help my westy has a strange behaviour up hills, after a
short time up hill the bus start to fail as a fuel stravation, if the hill is
not to step or long I can manage my self to go over but in the other hand in a
very step or long hill the bus fail to dead. As soon I change the position
avery works well.
Somebody in the list know about this problem or maybe already experienced it?

As ususal thanks in advance.


From the sunny sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela
