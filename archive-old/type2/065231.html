&gt;tranny.  Now comes the task of wiring it for an aux. batt. setup.  I

&gt;power into 110 for an outlet.  I hope to set it up something like this:
&gt;All the electrics that are to be run from the aux. grp.24 DEEP CYCLE
&gt;batt.  will first be wired to a fuse/rocker switch(each appliance with
&gt;its own fuse and rocker switch), then run the central wire from the
&gt;fuse/switch panel to the batt.  Battery will be connected to isolator and
&gt;isolator to alternator.  Is that right so far?  If any one could give me
&gt;any help with this please let me know.

First of all, a group 24 deep cycle battery is probably not going to be
adequate.  At a minimum, go with a group 27.  They are also widely
available.
What are you planning to run?  If you are running anything that draws a
significant amount of current, or that will be run overnight, dump the
group 27 and get a pair of golf cart batteries.  They are much closer to a
true deep cycle and will last longer and supply more power than the group
27 battery.
Forget the isolator/alternator setup and wire a high-power relay which
connects the + on your aux batteries to the + on your starting battery.
These relays are silver canisters that are available at RV stores for about
10 bucks.  Cheaper than the &quot;isolators&quot; and work better too.
