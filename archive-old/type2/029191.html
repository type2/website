&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;  I am not a pilot
&gt;&gt;  nor do I play one on my computer (never got the hang of those flight
sims).
&gt;&gt;  I am open to other reccomendations! &gt;&gt;

&gt;   I am not a pilot but I am an aircraft mechanic and CO poisoning is
&gt;something to be very much on guard against.  Sporty's pilot shop and most
&gt;airport shops where planes are serviced sell a small (2&quot; square or so)
&gt;passive CO detector.  This is self adhesive and can be mounted on the
dash.
&gt;It is a plastic panel with a circle of chemical that is yellowish white in
&gt;the center.  When exposed to CO it turns brown to black and is good for
&gt;several months.  They sell for about $5.00.

The pilot that wrote the article wasn't real impressed with those patches,
but I guess they woulkd be better then nothing. I'm still not sure I ever
successfully got the URL of that article out since I forgot it in the first
post and the server went down right after so here it is again.
