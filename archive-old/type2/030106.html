Volks,

Last week I asked for suggestions of books to bring when I went across the
United States next month.  I recieved a number of excellent suggestions,
and will definitely be bringing my copy of the LOTR trilogy, all four of
them[1] and Blue Highways!

Here are the responses I received:

&gt; I recommend The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Other than the fantasy part
&gt; about hobbits and wizards and elves and such, it's a good &quot;travelling&quot;
&gt; book. Ones to curl up with when you're off the road and need to wind
&gt; down.

&gt;          &quot;Blue Highways&quot; - William Least Heat Moon -
&gt;          &quot;Manifold Delights&quot; - ? - The Joys of Cooking on a vehicle's
&gt;                                    engine...
&gt;          &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; - William Pirsig
&gt;          &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; - Thomas Pynchon

&gt;    I'll root amongst the books; there a series out there called Free
&gt; Campgrounds USA, broken up into regions.  Found it useful biking across
&gt; the country back in 1984, but removed sections from it as I was
&gt; traveling light.

&gt;      Having a Woodall's or Good Sam Camping guide helped me lots of
&gt; times- Woodall's has a state map at the beginning of each state section;
&gt; Good Sam's has color maps in one section at the beginning.  They do list
&gt; State Parks and Forest campgrounds.

&gt; I've had good luck with the &quot;Let's Go - USA&quot; book.
&gt; It is written with the hitchhiking, backpacking and
&gt; on-a-budget type traveller.
&gt; AAA road atlas, because I get them free as a member.

&gt; Especially if you plan to do much camping, the DeLorme state atlases,
&gt; based on USGS topographical maps, are very useful.  Most of the
&gt; warehouse stores [Sam's Club, COSTCO] sell them for ~$10.00 - half the
&gt; cover price.  I've only used their Washington and Oregon atlases, but
&gt; with their exhaustive gazetteers and large format maps they are
&gt; definitely superior to the more typical Rand McNally or AAA
&gt; publications.

&gt; My personal favorite (which, by the way, does live in the book rack
&gt; behind my head) is Karl Franz's &quot;People's Guide to Mexico&quot;.
&gt; Informative, a fun read, and it's published by John Muir Press.

[1] the only possible answer to the question, &quot;How many books in a
trilogy?&quot;, is obviously... not three! :-)
