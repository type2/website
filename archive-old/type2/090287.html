&gt; I am a barbarian :-)  A brass hammer is the ideal tool for this job, you
&gt; are correct.  I don't own one :-(  I do own a fine selection of BFH's and
&gt; punches, tho :-)

IN a pinch, I've done it with a strip of 1/8 aluminum and a ball-peen
hammer.  You put the strip against the hub and tap through the strip.

My brass hammer was purchased years ago at a garage sale.  From the looks
of it, it was one of those &quot;make your own tool&quot; metal shop project for
someone.  Aluminum handle shrunk-fit and roll-pinned to the brass head.
Snap-on should be so good!  :)

In any case, it is a one-time purchase that will last a lifetime unless
you make a habit of loaning tools out.


  If this were a Vanagon, I'd suggest a tow back and a
&gt; press.  For some reason, Vanagon CVs tend to be a metric bear (which is
&gt; 2.2 times as bad as an American bear!!!) to get on and off, but bays need
&gt; a tap or two at most in my experience.

I've had lots of fun getting the CVs out of the stub axle of vgons, but
never noticed any difference in getting the CV off of the axle.  Perhaps
the Vanagons are just newer and tighter?&gt;
