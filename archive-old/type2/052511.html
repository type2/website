Subject: [T2] how to read e- diagram

hello list!!!

i just got a wiring diagram for models 73-75. i have spent some days staring 
at it but nothing has come up yet (i can't see the light). maybe someone out 
there can give me a few tips on how to visualize and understand the diagram. 
my westy is indeed a spagetti western. thanks in advance...

paz...
