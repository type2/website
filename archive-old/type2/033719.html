&gt; &gt;Wow. That was a speedy reply.
&gt; I was just thinking the same thing.  Especially since it's 03:00 
&gt; where you are, right?

I have to confess. :) I pulled a late one again..

&gt; When you crank the engine before it starts, do all of the &quot;pulses&quot; 
&gt; sound even?  Or does it go ra-ra-RA-ra-ra-ra-RA-ra-ra-ra-RA...  
&gt; Pulses should all be the same, if not, it indicates one or more weak 
&gt; cylinders.

Hard to say, it catches on almost immediately.

&gt; When the engine is running, you can pull each spark plug wire from 
&gt; the distributor cap in turn and note the RPM drop.  The RPM drop 
&gt; should be nearly the same for all cylinders.  No or only slight RPM 
&gt; drop indicates (very) low compression in a cylinder, if everything 
&gt; else (spark, fuel) is working properly.

I think everything in the ignition should be ok, I recently (last
weekend) replaced spark plug wires, distributor cap and rotor because
of starting troubles.

*Very* weird behaviour from the engine here: 
- If I pull the wire from cyl. 4, it instantly dies. Tried it four
times now. 
- If I pull the wire from cyl. 3, the RPMs drop like expected. Not too
much, but noticable.
- If I pull the wire from cyl. 2, it actually speeds up if I allow
sparks to fly through the air (&gt;1.5 cm!), but if I put it back the
wire it goes back to the old RPM. Which is the same as when I do not
allow the sparks to fly, by the way.
- If I pull the wire from cyl. 1, nothing happens to the RPMs.
- At higher engine speeds (idle RPM is not constant) however,
cyl. 2 and cyl. 1 disconnection does seem to have the correct effect.

I guess that means cyls. 1&amp;2 need overhaul. And that means engine
removal... Hmm. I've never liked the idea of doing that.

I think I'll postpone the fuel pump removal as well then.

&gt; But really you should try and obtain a compression tester so there 
&gt; will be no uncertainty.  Here they only cost about US$30 - a 
&gt; worthwhile investment.

I'll try to borrow one, or ask a local garage. The trouble is that it
is not exactly *my* bus, I share it with a few friends. The friends
however, do not really share my enthousiasm when it comes to get their
hands dirty.

&gt; Do you have hydraulic lifters?  If not, have you checked your valve &gt; clearances?

No hydraulic lifters, but the valve clearances are up to spec. Set
them a few weeks ago.

Thanks again,
Mrten.
