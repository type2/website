Subject: Rebuit Brake servo, found a flaw...

Hello List,

I bought a rebuilt brake servo for my bus. When it
arrived, I inspected it for flaws and noticed a couple
of things. First, the rubber dust boot that is on it
has a couple of tears in it. One teat goes almost al
the way around the boot near the spring clamp. Will
this affect the opperation of the servo? I also
noticed that part of the seal that goes between the
servo and the master cylinder was just left there and
painted over. I am assuming that this is a critical
sealing point so the vacuum is not lost. My main
concern though is the split dust boot. Is there vacuum
inside the boot when the vehicle is in opperation? If
it is made to just keep dust out, then I can just mend
it with silicone but if it is going to be subject to
vacuum then It needs to be replaced right? I need to
know if it needs to be returned because of this. Thank
you for your time and have a great day!

Regards,

David Kelly
