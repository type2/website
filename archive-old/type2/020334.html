Subject: The ol' fuel filler pipe thang...

So, the fuel filler neck is definitely in bad shape on my recently
acquired '78 (Walter).  http://www.skanky_dot_org/bus/walter/

I've scoured the archives and have come up with this:

1)  Remove whatever you need to and pry off the circular access cover.
2)  Replace the fuel filler neck (211 201 119, in stock at Bus Depot, I
hope).
3)  Replace the hose with readily available 2.25&quot; diamater string
reinforced fuel hose, while I'm at it.
4) ???  

Should I also be prepared to replace some sort of elbow that may connect
to the tank, or can I even get to that without pulling the engine and
firewall/access cover?

What else can I get to and replace thru the access hatch?

Some of what I read lead me to believe that perhaps it's not necessary
to drop the engine to get the access cover to the gas tank off.  True? 
Should I go to this trouble and replace more lines/check things out
while I'm in there?

All advice appreciated!  I believe I have a bunch of spare fuel line
already, will look at condition of fuel lines when I do this.

Thanks!

Teri
