Subject: How do I set up my exhaust analyzer for CO%?

How do I initially set up the exhaust analyzer to read Co%. The directions on
the back of the box says to center the needle, but that would automatically
have the needle at about 3-4 %, and my Haynes manual says the CO% is between
.5 and 1.5%. My theory is that if the needle is set at 3-4% to start than I
would never get it to drop down low enough for what I need. Since the analyzer
reads A/F mixture also, I was wondering if all I'm concerned with is the CO%,
Should I adjust the needle so that it reads 0% before I place it in the
exhaust?
