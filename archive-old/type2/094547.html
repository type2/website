Subject: what about a electronic ignition

Hey guys,
I was thinking about replacing my points to an electronic igniter.  Is this
a good idea and if so what brand should I get?  I've heard that Pertronix
only has a 30 month warranty and that not all people have had that much
success with them.  That leaves me a little weary so is this something I
want to do?  Thanks
TARA
