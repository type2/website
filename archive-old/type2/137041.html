&gt; That is over 72 square feet of frontal wind resistance,

&gt; It is a snail's pace for road traffic. You will be forced by law to drive
&gt; at least 40 mph on many highways. The push on the sail at that speed is
&gt; ENORMOUS. Your type 2 probably can't maintain it flat out in third gear.

IBTD.  The RV trailer is running behind the bus, where most of its
wind resistance is already dealt with because the bus itself has
just passed through the air in the trailer's way.

My 50 bhp bus doesn't feel any slower, or consume any more gas, 
regardless of whether or not I'm pulling my (admittedly tiny)
RV trailer.  And that trailer is several inches higher and wider
than the bus.  (It weighs less than half a tonne, though.)

A Type 4 engined bus *can* pull a trailer with a bus on it, and
still reach the German legal top speed for trailers (50 mph).  BTDT.
I wouldn't recommend that weight and size of trailer for regular 
use, though.  But anything that doesn't much exceed a metric tonne
should be fine.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
