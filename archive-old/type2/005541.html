Subject: Re: [T2] Engine temperatures

The readings seem really good for a heavy bus, in my opinion, the only one I
question is the oil pressure..How many RPM was the engine turning at
20-25PSI??

The Berg dipstick is not always accurate, the gauges seldom vary, with
sender relocations, as our test car has 4 senders, (sump, dipstick, and a
tapped main oil galley and one directly in the housing for the oil cooler
adaptor inlet)) The gauges are all VDO, and they stay within 10 degrees of
each other, except  the one going into the cooler, which is almost always 20
degrees hotter.

Contrary to what the heavens may say, I still believe in gauges..

Subject: [T2] Engine temperatures


&gt; Just got back from a 1000 mile vacation trip in my 1971 Westy (stock 1600
&gt; DP, doghouse, no thermostat, flaps open, about 50K on the current
rebuild).
&gt; You may recall my previous posts regarding engine temperatures and my
&gt; experience with the Berg dipstick temperature switch (it seemed to light
up
&gt; any time my speed was in excess of about 55 to 60 MPH.  I had checked it's
&gt; calibration using the boiling water method suggested by Berg in the
&gt; instruction leaflet and found it to be OK, meaning it should start to come
&gt; on at 225 to 227 deg. F).  So, before my trip, I installed VDO gauges for
&gt; oil temperature (with sump plate sender), oil pressure and cylinder head
&gt; temperature.
&gt;
&gt; I checked the oil temperature gauge calibration before I installed it by
&gt; hooking it up (powered by a 12V battery) and dunking the sender in boiling
&gt; water.  When the sender was completely immersed in boiling water, the
gauge
&gt; read about 220 deg. F.  When I immersed only the sensing slug of the
sender
&gt; (i.e., the part normally immersed in oil with the sender installed in the
&gt; sump plate) the gauge read about 212 deg. F.
&gt;
&gt; I live in the Philly, PA area so elevation above sea level is not an
issue.
&gt;
&gt; My readings at 60 to 65 MPH and 80 to 95 deg. F ambient temperature after
an
&gt; hour or so of driving were as follows:
&gt;
&gt; OT gauge 180 to 200 deg. F
&gt; OP gauge 20 to 25 psi
&gt; CHT gauge 275 to 300 deg. F
&gt; Berg sender &quot;Steady ON&quot;
&gt;
&gt; This was with the Westy fully loaded with 10 days worth of camping stuff
and
&gt; 3 people, and a good portion of the trip was chugging up steep mountain
&gt; roads in West Virginia.  After a while I removed the Berg sender and put
the
&gt; regular dipstick back in because I got tired of looking at the light being
&gt; on. The bus ran great with no problems, and I did not even have to add any
&gt; oil.
&gt;
&gt; I can think of the following reasons to explain the disagreement between
the
&gt; OT gauge and the Berg sender:
&gt;
&gt; 1. The oil temperature at the dipstick location is considerably higher
than
&gt; it is at the sump plate.  Not likely, but concievable (a real stretch) if
&gt; there is in fact significant heat dissipated by the bottom of the
&gt; engine/sump plate.
&gt;
&gt; 2. The Berg sender is being influenced by heat conducted into it by the
&gt; dipstick tube into which it is installed.  That I can believe, based on
what
&gt; I found when I was checking the VDO gauge and VDO sender.
&gt;
&gt; Any other ideas?
&gt;
&gt; Are my readings indicative of a healthy engine?
