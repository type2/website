Folks,

I know it ain't Friday, but this one is short and won't start a thread.

About 80% of the respondees to my poll question of &quot;Do you install a type4 as
a longblock ot turnkey?&quot;  choose to install an 'almost turnkey' engine.  

Mostly, people install everything but the AFM, carbs and maybe a distributor
before installing the engine in the bus.

Thanks for your responses,

clark in ky.
