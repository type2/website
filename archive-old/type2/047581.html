Subject: [T2] Re:  Re: [VB] Lady in Michigan wants bus info

Why Mike, why?    why do you say that?   what is wrong with someone wanting 
an old bus to travel in?     I think it is great.   When I was a little kid 
my folks had a bus for a couple years and we went camping a lot.   It was 
really fun.   I could stand up in it.  And everywhere we camped there were 
families with kids around me and my brother's age (so he could find someone 
else to beat up on- just kidding)    I dont see that anymore.  Is it the 
economy?  but the economy is supposed to be better?  Is it the expense of 
camper vans?  The rise of RVs?       I went and got a bus to travel in , and 
went on Dead Tour with my friends.  It was one of those VW vans with a 
sliding door and a pop top a person could sleep in and an ice box with a 
water pump and sink, and a tire on the front.   It was very cool.  Eventually 
I found out there was another version of VW bus, and the other version had 
the kind of window latches in the back windows, the ones with the little 
white knobs that I remembered from being a little kid.

Jeez  is this the anti hippy thread again?   or is it anti new bus people?   
OKay who knew everything about buses when they first got one?   She knows 
more than I did in that at least she is trying to get info before her first 
bus purchase And she had a bug.    I am so so glad that peope were supportive 
of me figuring out how to maintain my bus when I was new at it, and didn't 
give me that kind of attitude.   THat the guys at the VWFLAPS would help me 
figure stuff out, and sell me the parts, cause I never brought a car in there 
for them to work on.     I also didn't realise at first how unusual it was 
for a girl to be into her bus, and how much of a hard time and dissing people 
would in the future give about it,    as I was in Santa Cruz,  a funky hip 
california beach town.

I was sooo glad to see she wants a bus with the sliding door. I would suggest 
vanagon or eurovan to her.

&lt;&lt; I got this note from a lady in Michigan, but thought I would pass it on to 
 the list. I did tell her about vintagebus_dot_com and type2_dot_com. I know there 
 are other sites out there or others with more knowlege than I have. Maybe 
 someone can contact her or maybe a local Vdubber can help.
 
 Here is her address and what she said:
 
 Her name is Mink  and address is   minkett_at_zensearch_dot_net
 
 
 
 Hi, I was recently reading your classified ad and decided to drop you a
 line.  I'm in the U.S.A., in Michigan, and I was wondering if you could
 help me. I have wanted a bus for years, in fact, I lived in one until I
 was five w/ my folkie parents.  I have even owned a '69 Beetle and have
 had some experience with engine work.  My boyfriend and I are planning
 to travel the country in the upcoming summer, and I am wanting us to
 finally take the plunge and get a bus. My problem is this- I'm having no
 trouble finding busses for sale, but when looking at listings I have no
 idea which type of bus is which!  Vanagon, Westfalia, Camper, Kombi,
 EuroVan, Generic Bus, Type 2...(not to mention special issues etc)  The
 list goes on and on, and I have no idea which is which, and no idea how
 to learn and find out!  When I do purchase one, I want to make an
 educated purchase.  But how can I do that if I have no idea what the seller
 is talking about?   Please get back to me on this!  I REALLY appreciate
 it!  Sincerely, Mink
 P.S.  Here is what I want:  the kind of bus with the tire on the front,
 a pop top for sleeping, and a little sink console, the sliding side
 door, and a back door too.  This is what I lived in when I was little &gt;&gt;
