&gt; I gotta disagree with this.  The cam and valves are NOT different for FI vs
&gt; carb-ed engines (were talking type IV VW motors here).  The cam is different
&gt; for engines with hydraulic valves.  Valve sizes differ for the 1700, 1800,
&gt; and 2000 engines.

I thought the valves were smaller.  Maybe I'm thinking of Type 1 FI
heads.

&gt; 
&gt; But the part about rich/lean tradeoffs is true for all carburetors.
&gt; 
&gt; A fuel injection system has sensors and a brain that decide how rich/lean to
&gt; make the mixture based on engine speed, throttle angle, temperature, etc. so
&gt; you always have an optimum mixture going to the engine.
&gt; 
Today's fun fact:  The Bosch L-Jetronic system used in our Buses uses
these inputs to decide on mixture:
Intake air volume
Intake air temperature
Cylinder head temperature
Engine RPM

And that's really about it.  Some models also have an oxygen sensor to
provide mixture feedback information to the computer and some have a
throttle switch that closes when full throttle is reached, signaling the
computer for full enrichment.  There is no throttle angle sensor
however, our systems are a bit primitive for that.

There is also a separate cold start system that is independent of the
brain.  It enriches the mixture when starting the engine via the cold
start valve.  It decides engine temp via the thermo-time switch.  But
the cold start valve only operates when the starter is operating.  Cold
engine enrichment after the engine is started is handled by the brain
and regular fuel injectors.  

The only mixture that is &quot;user adjustable&quot; on the FI system is the idle
mixture, which is adjusted via a screw on the air flow meter.  Mixture
at speed is theoretically not adjustable but I think there are some ways
to work around that.

Just thought I'd throw that out there :-)

&gt; Carburetors, on the other hand, don't have ANY sensors and typically have an
&gt; idle circuit, a transition circuit of some type (ie. emulsion tube), and a
&gt; main circuit.  That means you can only adjust your mixture for 3 constants -
&gt; 1000 RPM to around 1800 RPM uses only the idle circuit, around 1800 RPM to
&gt; around 2300 RPM uses a combination of idle and main mixed together with the
&gt; emulsion tube (or similar device), and anything above that speed uses the
&gt; mixture set by the main circuit.  This will cut into your overall
&gt; performance and economy.  If you set up a carb(s) for top-end power, your
&gt; bottom end and economy suffers.  If you set it up for economy, your power
&gt; suffers.  And there's damn-near no way to set it up to have optimum bottom
&gt; AND top end at the same time.
