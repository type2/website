Bravo, Bob! In summer the currents come straight off the Alaskan coast, 
just a few degrees warmer than icebergs.

On a trip over to the coast, back in the 70s, we took my old Corvair 
van. We were surprised to see a couple guys body surfing. When we came 
back up the beach to the van, we fired up the bar-b-que. A couple 
minutes later, they returned from the surf. They were shaking so hard, 
the driver couldn't get the key in his door lock.
