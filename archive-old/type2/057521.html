Subject: Re: what to do (buy the Westfalia or not)

$400? Are you kidding? For a '79 Westy -- myself, I'd pay that even
if the engine was missing altogether. Well, that depends, of course, on
what the body and interior are like, but if they're decent, grab it.
OTOH, why don't you give me the owner's phone # and I'll talk to them
for you about it. 
    Where'd you say it was?
