&gt; Before I resort to &quot;sticking a penney in the fuse box&quot;,  does anyone know
&gt;  how many amps a solenoid should draw? 

Measure the resistance of your solenoid.  Amps = Volts divided by Resistance. 
 Often it's hard to measure very low resistance.  You can however measure the 
voltage drop when you have two resistances in series and calculate the 
resistance.  Put a 1.2 K ohm 1/4 watt or larger (or something close) resistor 
in series with your solenoid then measure the voltage drop across each.  The 
resistance will be proportional to the voltage drop. It should be between 1 
and 2 Ohms 
It this isn't clear just send me the #'s &amp; I'll do the calculation for you.  

Good Luck;
Tim
