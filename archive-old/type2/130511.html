&gt; was a 914 FI engine.  On cylinder #3 near the furthest-forward 
&gt; manifold bolt there is something screwed into the block.  It looks a 
&gt; bit like a pipe that has been pinched shut.  Is this a boss for a 
&gt; Temperature sender?&quot;

Hello Guys   914 motors had a breather in the top of each head     later and 
have fun  Mark dearing
