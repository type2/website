&gt; oh, ye of little faith....

Don't get me wrong either, I have made money on 2 bus sales even
counting my work in the last few years and could probably turn
a profit on my '85 or '78, but as a rule, particularly with the
T4 engine or Wasserboxers, they will bite you more often than not.

BTW I'm holding fast on $3500 being twice what it takes to build a
T4, even correctly with stock parts that is ludicrous, Stephens wants
under $1500, same for AVP, quality is likely as good as VW built it.
To do yourself is actually a bit more expensive but even race balanced
and with German gaskets, P&amp;C's (assuming they are still available) etc
not more than $2000 in engine alone, with installation parts maybe
$2500.
