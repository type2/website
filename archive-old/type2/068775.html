&gt;   &gt;&gt;Problem #2
&gt;   After driving long distances (200+ miles), the van willfail to start
&gt;   once the ignition is turned off.  I thought my startermay be getting
&gt;   too hot and tripping a &quot;breaker&quot; so I ran a wiredirectly from my
&gt;   battery to the starter.  The wire is connected to thestarter and
&gt;   dangles loose near the battery.  When it will not startI have to use
&gt;   my&quot;hot wire&quot; to get it going how can this problem befixed? Why does it
&gt;   occur? &lt;&lt;

I assume your &quot;hot start&quot; wire is connected to the starter solenoid 
along with the activation wire from the ignition switch.

If so then what you are experiencing is a temperature dependant bad
connection, This causes sufficient voltage loss to be unable to activate
the starter solenoid.

This was particularly (so I'm told) a problem with 6 volters where you
have less juice to start with.

To permanently circumvent this problem use the wire that comes from the
ignition to the starter solenoid to activate a relay. This relay will
switch in a supply straight from the battery to the starter solenoid, 
thus circumventing the long route and many connections the electricity
would other wise flow through.

I think Muir describes this.
