Subject: Cartridge Rolls and mandrels for Dremels

I have searched all over up here for cartridge rolls, asked people and
gotten no replies. Does anyone know of a good source for these so I can port
and polish my VW heads? I want to use them in my dremel, and would like to
get a fairly long mandrel for it, about 3&quot;. Anyone know of a internet
supplier that'd ship to Canada?
Thanks,
Courtney
