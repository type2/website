&gt;There is only one manufacturer, so no matter where you buy the canvas you
&gt;will get the identical product.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;  The standard replacement is 100% cotton and does have three windows (with
&gt;screens and zippered flaps).  It is well constructed and heavy duty. An
&gt;acrylic version is also available for about $40 more.
&gt;Each version has its plusses and minuses; one is not necessarily better 
&gt;than the other. The
&gt;acrylic material is primarily used for marine applications, and its big
&gt;claim to fame is that the color doesn't fade even after prolonged exposure
&gt;to bright sunlight (like on a boat). But since a VW poptop is not exposed to
&gt;nearly that much continuous sunlight, I have never even seen the cotton ones
&gt;fade after years.
=========================&gt;
Accepting the fact that there was probably just a single supplier, or, at 
best, all suppliers using similar materials and techniques ...........
I replaced Casper's original tent with a cotton one purchased from JC 
Whitney on a special sale plus discount about three years ago.

The tent was used that same year for a 2 month trip.
The next year, it was used for another 2 month trip.
Last year, it was used for a 7 month trip.

After just the first year's use on the 2 month trip and the subsequent 
campings, I began to notice the cotton tent starting to show substantial 
fading of color.

On NewBus, the original tent is still quite nice with the exception of just 
a couple of worn areas starting to show.

If I were to replace either bus with another tent, I would look for 
something made of a material more akin to the original, as my experience 
with Casper's early on cotton material fading is pretty aggravating.
