Subject: [T2] Brittle wire in engine bay

You might try heat shrink tubing.
From Radio Shack they tubes are about 8&quot; long but from commercial
electronics suppliers and Fry's the tube are 36&quot; long.
The tubing I've used in the past seems to have been fuel and  oil proof but
you might want to test first.
