Subject: My first engine pull was a success

First, let me take a minute to thank all of you who helped
me to overcome my fears of pulling my first engine.
Thanks for all the tips and words of encouragement
from you fine folks:
Nick Pace, Bob Lee, Ken Hoopen, Mike in Az and Don
Boneau.  Also Josh R. (thank David for me for being on call
even though I never called him).

Things went really smooth after I was able to get the &quot;rear
carrier&quot; out of the way.  I had to destroy the rubber mounts
to get it to come loose (with the engine supported of course).
After that was out of the way and the last bolts were removed
it just rolled out on my jack.  Next time I will have a handy cart
thanks to Don Boneau's drawings.

All went well and now I can get busy with the resurrection.  Man
these engines are really small once you get all the aluminum
and fan shrouds off.

I'll have pics up soon of my progress.

Thanks all,
This list rocks!
Later,
