Subject: Re: [T2] Dying headrests

Talked to a friend who told me of a long term test of SEM type vinyl paint. 
He says it works well on door panels and dashes which do not get much wear 
(rubbing wear) but on seats use Ditzler vinyl dye which soaks into the 
vinyl and is permanent versus something like SEM (which I have used, love 
and have raved about) which sits on top of the vinyl and trys to bond with 
the vinyl so it doesn't flake or rub off.

My friend says after about a year the SEM on the seats rubbed off (sort of 
like rubber cement or eraser pieces) but the Ditzler was as good as factory 
vinyl color. Said the SEM was good on the door panels.

Both SEM and the Ditzler paint (I can get more specific on the part numbers 
tomorrow if you like) are sourced at a professional auto body supply store 
- not generally at the FLAPS.

FWIW and YMMV.
