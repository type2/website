&gt;1) As for the fuel pump, yes -- the kit does not include one.  I did not
&gt;mention this directly, as I _did_ mention that I going dual carbs and will
&gt;be using an electric pump.  ((I'm under the assumption, perhaps incorrect,
&gt;that stock fuel pumps won't drive a set of Dual Kadrons?))

I don't know why the stock pump couldn't keep up, you can't push all that
much vapor through those little valves, but then again I have not had good
luck with Brazilian mechanical pumps lately so whatever. Once we had this
teensy little Morris Garage car and its electric fuel pump would start to
buzz audibly about a half-mile before it ran out of gas, it was a bug but
it made for a nice feature, maybe yours will do that. 8)

&gt;3) Carb clearance:  I have seen my VW FLAPS carry a part (I think $10) that
&gt;basically is a 3 inch riser for the carb.  This gets around the clearance
&gt;problems.  Of course, your air cleaner may be a problem now :)  I've also
&gt;believe another listee said the new Bocar 30/31-PICT doesn't have clearance
&gt;problems, but I have not confirmed this myself.

Well, probably because a 30/31 will have to sit up on top of an adaptor to
fit the DP manifold anyway? Same song different voice? If you have dual
carbs the air snorkel problem wouldn't apply to you. Dual carbs. Kids these
days. When I was young we carburated by spitting the gas out between our
teeth and we LIKED it.

&gt;I've had one (older style) Alternator where there is a section ground out of
&gt;the driver side to accommodate a carb.  I'm sure a good VW FLAPS can do this
&gt;for you.  I didn't see that in impacted the Alternator in anyway... maybe
&gt;your warranty :)

You could do it in a few seconds with a bench grinder. I did it with a
drill and it takes a while. Grinding aluminum is fun because it makes a lot
of macho metallic dust for very little effort. 8)
