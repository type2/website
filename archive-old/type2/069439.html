Subject: Re: Valve Adjustment - Procedure

&gt; Bentley is correct about turning the engine counter-clockwise, but the 90
&gt; degree figure shown in the book is very much incorrect.  Muir is more correct
&gt; in saying 180 degrees and it can be done clockwise if you can keep track of
&gt; which cylinder you're adjusting.      OK I am a newbie to the aircooled thing and was very alarmed when I read Jim's 
post about the procedure because I adjusted the valves on my Super Beetle as per the 
Bentley instructions. I called several reputable shops and got both answers. Some said 
180 and some said 90. I then went back and read my Bently. I quote from page 26 in the 
Bentley for Supers, Beetles, And Karmanns 70-79:
        &quot; turn the engine until THE ROTOR moves counterclockwise 90 deg. from the #1 
firing position. This will correctly position the #2 cylinder.....&quot;
Okay, if we turn the ENGINE 180 degs how far does the rotor turn? 90 deg?
This is my theory, though my car is not here to test it on. It is all in the wording. 
Engine 180 deg = rotor 90 deg?????
Well if i am wrong please tell me, this has been driving me nuts!!!!!!
Thanks..........Chip
