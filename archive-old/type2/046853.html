&gt;$5 to $6000. I wouldn't want to drive on a long
&gt;trip to anywhere in
&gt;a car that's worth $2000 or $3000. Consider it a
&gt;measurement of risk.

Uh I'll toss in my unreasonable sense.  I paid $3800 for the '77.
It had 65k miles and was as new.  This was about 5 years ago.
I think most people who have seen it would call it a nice bus,
maybe one of the nicest origional buses they have ever seen.
I've turned down serious offers in the $7k range, but frankly don't
doubt (and am in fact attempting at the moment) to replace it
with something I actually will drive everyday for well under $5k.

I've looked at several origional low mileage (under 80k honest)
late 70's westy's around $5k in the last 5 years.  If you want one
you go where they are and get it.  If you don't care to, you may
have to go out and pay $8k (or something even more ridiculous)
right now.  I'm not knocking the existence of an $8k late 70's
camper, but it would have to be as new, not restored to me.  I mean
clean, origonal, and under 75000 miles with perfect maintainence
records and an impeccable history.  There is no way in the world
even in the salt belt that I am in where I would pay over $10k
for anything less than a sub 25000 mile, garaged in a dark room,
well optioned deluxe '78 or '79.  I applaud anyone who has sold
a bay for more than 10, you found a hell of a sucker or someone too
dumb to travel to the south.

As to being uncomfortable driving a $2-3000 car.  Well I've put
over 150000 miles collectively on a score of vans few of which
I've paid more than $1500 for when all said and done.  But I'm
comfortable doing that, someone who isn't shouldn't perhaps.
There is no reason that you can't buy a mechanically perfect
Westy for $3000 or so, one you trust to drive 50,000 or more
flawless miles but doesn't look so great.

Like I said recently, best deal $ for $ is buying a nice body out of
CA for $1000-$2000 and putting an engine in it that you know and
trust as new.
