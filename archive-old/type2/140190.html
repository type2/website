Subject: Sink Cabinet Removal

So I want to pull out the sink cabinet in my non-deluxe 78 westy.  I want to 
confirm that all joints on the water tank are tight and that there is no 
leaking anywhere - I also want to check/replace my water pump.

So ... I see two bolts behind the driver's seat ... one bolt going into the 
floor and one bolt going into the ice box - is that it - or are there more?
