&quot;Riviera Motors was the Beaverton, Oregon based
regional distributor of Volkswagens. At some point
they decided to contract with ASI (Automotive
Services, Inc.), based in the Vancouver, Washington
area, for Type 2 camper conversions modeled after
Westfalia Campmobiles. Why Riviera decided to do this
is a puzzle, because Campmobiles sold like hotcakes in
the Pacific Northwest.&quot;
