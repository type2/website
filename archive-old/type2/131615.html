Subject: RE: [T2] What's a &quot;Pure&quot; bus?

&gt;From: Ben Timmons

&gt;Don's dilemma is similar to mine.  Bus in yard, wants to camp / drive but 
&gt;no $$$ to finish getting it running.  Yes, he's got a spare engine for his 
&gt;Toyota laying around, so why not think about it.

Getting it running is one thing, &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; is another, even if 
it is a replica of a reinvention(ie. Road Cow). It is cool to try new things 
and do what hasn't been done. But i remember the late eighties phrase &quot;Don't 
bite my style&quot;. He is also talking about money for a fresh rebuilt engine as 
opposed to the kit for the toyo, all the fabrication that will have to be 
done, the tools to buy to do it, etc.

&gt;I agree with Mark about the Zen being wrong on this, but as a group of 
&gt;people we either need to support our list members in what they want to do 
&gt;with their busses (including cutting them in half and welding them to 
&gt;school busses -- ARRRRGH!)  or help folks like Don get their VW engines 
&gt;running.

We do need to support the list members. We need to help people like Don get 
their &quot;VW Engines&quot; running. But you can't help people that don't want help.

&gt;I suggest we help this guy get his bus running....  eh?

If he can focus on the problems, I am sure we can offer solutions. &quot;Pure bus 
solutions.&quot;
