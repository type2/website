look,

when i posted this question about solid and hydraulic
lifter swappage, i had no idea that it would incite
riots on the list. all i wanted was a few opinions,
and perhaps some feedback from past experiences.
however, I (the list) has no need for petty bickering.
that's not what i had thought this list was all about.
obviously people are going to have different opinions.
opinions that have probably been influenced by past
experiences. the beauty of it is that everyone can
have an opinion, and express it on this list without
really hurting anyone. there is no need to get
offended if someone has an opposing opinion. c'mon, i
thought we were all pals here! helpling each other
with our buses, remember?

i'm leaving my engine solid, thank you to everyone who
responded to my question. later
