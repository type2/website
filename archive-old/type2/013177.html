Hi,

I searched the archive, but it was just giving me broken images and
&quot;ht://Dig 3.1.5&quot; as a response. Don't know what's up with that...

We've been having problems with our electrical system for a while
(original generator and second but old Sears voltage regulator PO
installed) and figured that since replacements are necessary that we
would upgrade to an alternator. What is the general opinion on Kymco's
Super 75 alternator kit? Worth it? Junk? Should be just get the factory
55amp alternator? Will there be a problem with our doghouse cooler?

I found the library article on the upgrade procedure that mentioned
poor quality of the aftermarket kits but I'm not clear whether it is
saying not to use them at all or just find the original tin pieces?

Thanks,
Jen :)
