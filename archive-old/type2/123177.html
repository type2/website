Subject: Re: [T2] Reverse will not engage in 74 automatic bus. Any
  ideas?

&gt; I am having a problem with my 74 automatic bus. I
&gt; cannot get it to go into reverse. It has plenty of

&gt; reverse worked fine until I installed the rebuilt
&gt; engine. When the gear changer is moved to reverse, the
&gt; transmission sounds like it tries to go into reverse
&gt; but nothing happens? What gives? I have tried letting
&gt; the engine warm up and I have tried running the engine

sounds like the shifter linkage is out of adjustment.  the 74 shift
linkage is controled by the front shifter,  how did you disconect the
linkage from the tranny when removing the engine.  sounds like the linkage
didn't go back exactly as taken out, not unusual 

take your bentley and follow the adjusting prochedure to the letter
it is very touchy adjustment

&gt; through the gears. Any ideas? Is this transmission
&gt; shot? I am selling this bus to a local but it would be

probably not

&gt; nice to be able to back it up in the mean time. Oh,
&gt; this bus sat for 3-4 years without being driven for
&gt; any significant length. Before sitting, the
&gt; transmission worked fine and yes, the vacuum hose for
&gt; it is hooked up. THanks!

change the traanny fluid too
