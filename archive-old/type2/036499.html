Subject: gaskets (was RE: proper torque for 1600DP intake manifold studs?)

Last time I replaced my gaskets I used the card ones.  They were recommended
by Stateside Tuning in London, a good shop that builds race engines.  The
guy there said they don't leak as much as the metal ones.  I used a bit of
hylomar on them and they've been great (wish I could say the same about my
exhaust gaskets :-( ).  I noticed when I took the old (metal)gaskets off
that they were rough and pitted.
