Subject: Re: [T2] 78 fi or carb...it lives!


&gt; Now for a question...it sounds like it needs a serious valve
&gt; adjustment...but it's supposed to be hydraulic lifters.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible that they are gunked up and not &quot;pumping up&quot; or is 
&gt; there
&gt; any adjustment that needs to be performed.  I haven't pulled the 
&gt; valve
It is common for Type 4 Hydraulic Lifters to make noise for ten minutes
after the engine has set for an extended time frame. Remember they are
lying on their side and drain out, not like V8 or In line four/six
lifters that hold most of their oil.

When you install the new push rod tube seals, clean the sealing surfaces
real good. The new O rings don't require any sealers but some manuals
suggest it. If you crush the tubes a little you can drive a *close to ID*
size socket through the tube with an extension on it and re-round them.
When you install the new O rings and start pushing the tube in you can
use a 15 MM socket on the end of an extension to help guide them in and
apply pressure to get them to drop in (lube the O rings). You will need
to take a screw driver and gently slide it around the top of the head
seat o ring so it will drop in. Be sure that you install the wire
retainers for the push rod tubes. I'm not sure that they actually do
anything but VW put them in for a reason.

If you have solid lifters the push rods will be three piece, Steel on
both ends and aluminum in the middle. Hydraulic lifter push rods are one
piece steel tube.
