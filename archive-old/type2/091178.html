Subject: 1970 wiper questions

1970 westy:

where does it go FROM the top of the resevoir. i have chased all the
little hoses from the bottom of the resevoir to the button and to the
squirters... but there is the &quot;air pressure hose&quot; that is about 3&quot; long
that goes nowhere. i know in my 65 beetle, the hose attaches to the spare
tire and uses the pressure from the inflated tire to pressurize the
washer fluid. 

after fiddling around, gently pulling on the hoses to see where they led,
it rained the next day and when i went to turn on the wipers, they went a
couple of inches and stopped, not to budge again. did i losen a wire in
my exploration? i felt under where the back of the switch is, but i didnt
feel any wires come loose. so confused.

on a less important note, but still something that has confused me a
bit... the passenger wiper only touches on the outter 1/3 of it's arch.
the inner portion of the blade doesnt touch at all. i tried pushing it to
the glass to see if it may be the spring is worn out, but that didnt
change how it connected with the glass. someone was talking about there
being a difference between L and R wiper arms... could it be that there
is more bend to the R and my problem is that i have a L ?
