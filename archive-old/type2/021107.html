Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Resolution

All I can say is.....I hope they last longer than the XZX set I bought 4
years ago...two years later, they were cracked and falling off the rims
with 10000 miles on them....spoke to Michelin, and they wouldn't do
anything without the original bill-o-sale...unfortunately, a break-in
found all of my receipts spread across a wet parking lot, so I was out
$500 worth of high end tires....keep the bills in a safe place.

Im sure its the Agilis 61s, I just got off the phone with Michelin and
they
said a boatload of them are heading for the states and we should see
them
showing up at our favorite suppliers soon.
