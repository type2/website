Tim,

I believe the show is 9am to 4pm.  This is one of the best shows around
here, and I would consider it both bus and bug.  At least a good place to
get bus parts.  Personally, I'm not there for the &quot;show cars&quot; but all the
rest...

I think some are planning on spending Saturday night camping in the parking
lot.  I will most likely sleep in my crew cab... not sure (only 30 minutes
away, but I'd like to meet some people so would go Saturday night if it
meant others would be there).

Of course, bad weather, other distractions, who knows what could make it a
sucky show -- but I doubt it.  It is pretty well publicized and known to be
the &quot;last show of the year&quot;.

Anybody out there know the hours of this weekend's VW show at Puyallup
Fairgrounds? Also, is this a good bus meet, or is it more Bug oriented? And
is
it Saturday and Sunday?

Thanks for any details.
