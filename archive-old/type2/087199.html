Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Build (Difficulty Rating?)

Simon,

Like anything else, it is going to be nerve racking the first time.

Buy the bentley, folow the instructions religiously, check everything 3 
times, and you will be fine.



Do you have the tools?  and the place to do it...and the place to clean 
things up?

How many miles on the parts in the old engine??

Cheers, dave

&gt; Dave,
&gt; I'd considered doing a rebuild myself, with the Al 
&gt; case.  I've seen them as cheap as $285.  It's still on 
&gt; my list of &quot;possibles&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; How high on the 'Difficulty Scale' is replacing the 
&gt; case?  I understand the process of gutting my engine 
&gt; and placing said guts in new case, but how hard is it 
&gt; really?
