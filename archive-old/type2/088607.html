Subject: value of stock '74 dual carbs and full exhaust (??on the exh.)

I would like to know the value of the used dual solexes for the 74 van I am
parting- ran OK as PO drove it from Va to Pa but it has too much rust.  The
engine was dismantled by him; also have  full exhaust, decent heater boxes
(German) and the Muffler, with original grey paint, has a VW symbol, made in
germany, and brand name of something like Leitztritz, with a notation of for
411/412 - does this mean the 411 muffler fit this bus?  The manifold is
combined with the heater boxes, which have a wierd combined dual outlet on
each side with no crossover stuff.
I assume this would fit the 75 bus as it has oval head exhaust port gaskets?
