&gt; Aren't these guys supposed to check that anyway?

Even the smog referee screwed up with my bus.
 
&gt; He told me since I didn't have an &quot;engine swap sticker&quot; that he'd have to go
&gt; by the book and bust me for my lack of egr.
&gt; 
&gt; He said the smog ref might let me off because I have factory electronic
&gt; ignition, though it isn't required.

I doubt it.  The referee would have the same concerns about the EGR.  They
just need to match your bus to some known configuration.  I don't have any
idea what happens when NLA parts get in the way but that's what the ref is
for.
 
&gt; The ref would give me the sticker which would tell the shop how to smog my
&gt; bus.
&gt;
&gt; Is this making sense to the CA smog crowd?

This how the sticker indicates the required tests and swapped engine:

&gt; Should I go through with this or just walk in to a no-name station and
&gt; probably fail?

First, go to the smog website and check your VIN to see if you already have
a fail recorded:

My own feeling on this is that you can probably get away with it but what
happens next test?  What about complications for a future owner?
