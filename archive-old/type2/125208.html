Subject: RE: [T2] 1 bumper bolt cap left in the US - (NOT!)

&gt; For anyone who is interested, I know this is a hard-to-find 
&gt; part.... I located one black cap (211707192), yes, only one!  
&gt; It's in Wooster, Ohio at Performance Vw (800)589-8797 I know 
&gt; it's only one..but, it's probably the last one in the US, 
&gt; maybe the world! 



Sorry to contradict you, but it's not even the last one on in the
eastern U.S, much less the world.  I have always stocked these.  In fact
I never knew they were supposed to be &quot;hard to find&quot; until I read it
here!

I import them right from Germany and sell them for 95 cents each. The
last time I re-ordered them, availability was not a problem. I couldn't
swear that this hasn't changed since then, but neither do I have any
reason to think that it has. At the moment I have both white and black
in stock.

Remember, you can search BusDepot_dot_com by either part number or
description. Try it both ways to be safe. This could save you a lot of
time and energy looking for parts that other parts suppliers think are
unavailable. :-)
