Hmm, just hit Friday here in the UK, so here's my Friday post. Went to the
hospital the other day for a scan (my wives pregnant). The hospital has a
policy of not disclosing the sex of a baby, as there is a high Asian
community in this area of London (_N.B. I'M NOT MAKING JUDGEMENTS, JUST
TELLING IT AS IT'S TOLD TO US BY THE HOSPITAL_ No flames please). Any way,
my wife has severe M.E. making her 90% house bound, so they agreed to tell
us the sex, so she had time to go shopping - cool! IT'S A BOY - COOLER! Now
I would have loved either, so my wife asked &quot;what's so good about a Boy?&quot; I
replied in jest &quot;Guns &amp; Motor bikes of course!&quot; Ha-Ha.

So now I'm just stoked.

R.B.C
Last week my wife decided that I should get the unborn baby used to my
voice, by taking to it. No problem, now he knows as much as I do about
tuning &amp; fault finding ignition systems &amp; after this w/end he will know ALL
about BA6's!
