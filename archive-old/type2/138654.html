Subject: Re: [T2] The full report (long)

&gt;From: Mark Hineline

&gt;I didn't do the thread. Wasn't sure how it would mix with the Loctite. 
&gt;That's okay. If the case leaks, Michael Knight is going to come and redo 
&gt;everything.


Then Mark is going to let me drive back with his new engine in my bus.
