Subject: Dumb Heat Question

Okay, I know this is dumb. It's got to be. It's too simple to be smart...and
I already can think of some problems with it myself...but this won't be the
first dumb question posted to this list. As a matter of fact, it won't be
the first dumb question *I've* posted.

What if a person installed an external oil cooler on the inside of the bus?
Would it provide any significant heat once it warmed up? Like a
radiator-type heater through which steam was piped.

I know that external oil coolers are typically used to reduce the temp of
the oil, so their primary use is in the summer time. BUT...if you don't live
where you need an external cooler, I don't see why you couldn't install a
shutoff valve for summer use (to keep from rising the interior temp) and use
the heater/cooler only in the winter. It would provide no help until the bus
warmed up, but personally, I can wear a jacket for the first 10-20 minutes.

If you really wanted to get the summer benefit of the oil cooler, why
couldn't you have two locations prepared for mounting the cooler/heater (one
external summer mount; one internal winter mount).

Would there be problems related to the distance the oil might have to be pumped?

I know the gas heaters are nice, but I don't have one anymore and I'm not so
sure that I want to invest in an older model, especially when Espar doesn't
even sell all the parts for them anymore.

Comments, flames, etc. appreciated.

Thanks! Joe
