Happy friday everyone.
Last night I was watching an old hippy show. &quot;SUNSHINE&quot;
that was filmed in Vancouver back in the 60's.
They were driving around in an old split window with
the exterior painted all funky.
In the show the girl was pregnant with another mans baby
and the boyfriend took responsibility to look after the baby.
The mother had cancer in her knee and refused to have her leg amputated.
Anyone see this?
Cool van.
