&gt;&gt;&quot;My plan is to use a test light to find . . .&quot;

I say:

I have been trying to build up a large stash of test lights to be able to 
tell if/when I have electricity in  variouse segments of a line.  I have 
been pulling the single pole/based light sockets and 1157 bulbs from the 
tail lights of junkyard cars [with bulb] that have just a single power and 
ground wire coming out of the socket.  I add on an alligator clip to the 
ends of both power and ground wires.

A very cheap test light.

You can afford to light up your engine compartment like a Xmas tree while 
running some other tests, but be careful that the bulbs don't get too hot 
against any loose lying fabrics you might be using to position the test 
light.
