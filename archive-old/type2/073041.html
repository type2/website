hey hey,

i've got a snazzy black vinyl Wolf center console, that i am trying to get
rid of. it came in a recently acquired bus and i don't really want it.
it's clean, and looks fairly new. if you live in the bay area it could be
yours. drop me a line, i live in Pacifica, work in Menlo Park and i go to
Santa Cruz and SF often so if your around any of those places, i might
deliver it, otherwise ya gotta come get it.

sorry but i won't ship it.

thanks
_andrew

emails? mainly before february of this year to as far back as possible.
