Thanks for the reply.  Here is a picture of the vacuum advance.

pictures)

Now for the retard, you can see the available nipple on the 
distributer.  Now, on the back of the carb is this

In the upper right corner of the picture you can see the unit attached to 
the back of the carb.  There are two connections, the one on the right is 
hooked up to the carb.  The one on the left is blocked off.  Is this where 
I should attach to the distributer?


&gt;The preheat riser that goes through the tin from the exhuast &quot;area&quot; to the 
&gt;intake air cleaner is simply grabing warm air during warm up. The '71 wax 
&gt;thermostat regulates itself on engine compartment amient temp and opens 
&gt;and closes a flap to divert the air intake from inside the compartment 
&gt;when warm and around the exhuast area when not. This only need be pulled 
&gt;from around the exhuast.

Excellent.  One less thing to worry about for now.  I'm just trying to 
ready it for its delivery to Maryland, which will occur in 2 weeks.
