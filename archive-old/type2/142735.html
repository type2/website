Subject: What part is missing?

I replaced my throttle cable today. Interestingly the rubber boot at
the pedal end of the steel tube was still in good condition. But the
cable was starting to snap strands at the linkage end. So it goes..

At the engine end of the steel tube is a flexible tube the cable runs
through. It goes from the tube to the firewall. But there's no fitting
or anything at the firewall. It's held in place by the cable which I
can't imagine is a good thing since it's going to rub on the firewall
opening.

Anybody know what fitting goes there?

BTW: With the new cable oddly enough I didn't need the big fat return
spring I had mickey-moused onto the linkage. The springs on the carbs
are working just fine to return the throttle. Plus the adjustments
allowed by the new cable were enough that I could put the dashpot on.
Richard was right. Bad adjustment. (Like Richard's ever right about
anything...heehee) Too bad the darn carbs still die when I come to a
light but idle beautifully when it's sitting still and doing
adjustments.
