We have a chrome yellow camper with the original orangish yellow curtains, 
which have been faded and bleached by sun exposure and age.
We tried rit fabric dye to restore the color, but the fabric rejects it and 
still remains discolored.
Have anyone grappled with this and come up with an effective solution?
Please share.
Thank you.
