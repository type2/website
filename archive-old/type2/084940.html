Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Rear Swaybar Question

I'm confused:

&gt;Interesting idea.  I'm a bit skeptical about the temper or &quot;springiness&quot;
&gt;of the resulting part.

and then:

&gt;Repeated heatings
&gt;to bright red hot have had no apparent effect on its original temper.
&gt;Files hardly leave a mark, and I did much damage to a good quality
&gt;grinding wheel while trying to tidy up one of the jagged broken ends


Doesn't these two statements conflict with each other?



Ciao!
