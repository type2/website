Subject: Re: [T2] Painting a Pop Top

Go to the Vanagon_dot_com list archives. Look for the topic of pop-top painting 
by an old guy named Beckett Cantrell. He uses a paint for Marine use made by 
Sherwin-Williams. It works GREAT. I mean incredibly nice finish. Prep work is 
almost nonexistant, and the stuff is bullet proof and only about 30.00 a 
gallon!
