&gt;I have a '71 Bus with a sliding door problem I can't figure out.  I 
&gt;replaced the U-shaped part on the middle/rear side of the door and 
&gt;now I think it might be the roller located under the rear window.  
&gt;But the door doesn't &quot;Pop&quot; out when pushing on doorhandle. 

I had the same problem on my 73.  Everything appeared to be in good
condition.  I cleaned and lubed everything and it still wouldn't pop out.  I
finally replace the old rubber seal and now it works fine.
