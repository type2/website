Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] new factory 1600DP motors??

Hey thanks Jim,
I know the last old beetle rolled off the production line in July 2003 (in 
Mexico, the last factory still making them). The very last one headed to the 
German VW museum. I also know Kombi's are still made (in Brazil, last 
factory making them), and I believe some still have type 1 motors installed. 
I also have been led to believe their demise is imenant, just not sure if 
it's the whole bus or just the type 1 motor version.
I guess the question for us is when that happens how long before fully 
assembled type 1 motors will no longer be available?
Richard

&gt;Someday, it's going to get to the point of just rebuilding existing engines 
&gt;because production of the &quot;old school&quot; Beetle in Puebla, Mexico &gt;ceased 
&gt;within the last year and I don't know of any VW factory still producing the 
&gt;model (maybe Brazil? Dunno myself).
