Subject: Intermittent clutch slip

Hi

I have a 79 bay with a 2litre CJ engine.  I have been driving it daily for 4
years and had no problems with the clutch apart from 2 snapped cables.

About 2 months ago I was driving a long a level road accelerating in 3rd
when the revs started racing and there was a bad burning smell. I took my
foot of the accelerator but there was still some slip in 3rd and 4th as I
accelerated more slowly.  I thought I would limp home but I made it over the
big hill to home with no problem at all.  I checked the freeplay ay home and
could find no fault.

I had no problems for two weeks after this but since have experienced the
problem about half a dozen times, always in third and fourth (with a
terrible smell).  The problem will then disappear as if by magic.

I live at the bottom of a steep hill which I climb every morning in 3rd and
it has never slipped going up this hill in the morning.

I would be gratefull for any help:- should i be saving for a new clutch;
could it be an oil leak?; is it rain?, could it be the return spring etc

thankyou in advance
