&gt;Now back in &quot;the day&quot; there was a company in
&gt;Italy that produced a truly superior one-piece replacement unit and at the
&gt;time I ordered a couple, figuring I would need them eventually.  Alas,
&gt;between the rust and some inherent genrousity, this is the last of that
&gt;batch and I KNOW that the italian company is long gone (they were going
&gt;when I did my bulk purchase, which is WHY I did the bulk purchase.

Are you sure it isn't ANSA?

&gt;Anyone got a better offer or a better idea?  I know I can change to the
&gt;'72-75 heater boxes and buy Ron's muffler, but I actually like the
&gt;incredibly complex 76-78 settup...  it's so &quot;byzantine&quot; :-)  I'd prefer to
&gt;stick with it.  I actually have an original X-over pipe and Y-elbow, but
&gt;no cat replacement tube nor muffler and tailpipe.  I could buy them and
&gt;return to factory stock (probably a good idea) but I'd rather find a
&gt;high-quality one-piece replacement muffler for '76-78.

I like this one (I bought it locally at Austin Veedub about 3 years ago):

The exhaust hanger was too short, it didn't bolt up to the heater boxes with ease, but it did have the EGR port and was about $100 that about average for aftermarket. I've keep the rust away with VHT paint.
