Subject: Re: [T2] help- my engine is making a popping noise

&gt;Can it be something
&gt;as simple as the exhaust?

I wonder if backfiring could be causing the noise and I bet that's what it 
is since it started after you went back to stock exaust  Has your timing 
been set? Do you have exaust leaks?
