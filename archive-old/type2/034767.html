Subject: Re: Rec. Vehicle or Daily Driver?

well,

I have put over 50k miles on my bus in the last 2-3 years.  Much of that
is to and from work.

It all depends on your temprament...  Can you handle no heat, occasional
funny behavior, having to do some maintenance.  If so, go for it.  Drive
it until it breaks, fix it, and drive it soem more.

Personally, i like to have at least 2 cars/busses, that way if one is down
i can drive the other to work.  You can do it with one car, but keep
spares on hand. (hoover recommends having a spre rebuilt engine ready to
pop in if yours poops out... might be overkill, but definitely not bad
advice!)

peas,

Steve
