 Hi volks,
                Firstly, when considering Octane, bear in mind that the number that VW quotes is an octane rating measured on the RON (Research Octane Number) scale. This is the same scale that's used on European Petrol pumps.
 In the US a different scale is used (surprise).  The octane number on US gas pumps is an average of the Research Octane Number and the Motor Octane Number and is a few points lower.
 Specifically, in the UK, the Research Octane Numbers for pump petrol are:
 
        4* Leaded:  97 RON
          unleaded:  95 RON
 super u/leaded:  98 RON

 So in terms of Octane all are well above what a humble VW needs.
 I don't know what the requirements of a pancake engine are regarding lead. I think it's likely that they don't &quot;need&quot; leaded fuel (same heads etc in Europe as in US?) to prevent Valve Seat Recession (VSR) but I also am lead (hah!) to believe that the heads/valves will last longer if leaded fuel is used.
 As to what I'll do: I dunno, yet. I'm currently thinking that if I still have the VW engine when leaded is phased out I will use a lead substitute if it's easy to do so and probably not if it isn't.
 I'll decide nearer the time when there's more information available. In New Zealand I used a lead substitute because I was intending to sell the camper and wanted to be able to reassure the new owner that I had done so and it was up to them whether to continue.
 
 Hope that's useful to someone....
Cheers,
              W.
