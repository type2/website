It depends completely on who rebuilds the engine as to whether you will get 
better specs from the rebuild as opposed to the south of the boarder new 
spec. I know I would have more faith in my VW engine rebuilder than I would 
in a new Mex factory engine. He's a second generation VW machinist and 
won't hex you with a junky GEX assembly, but Dad still hangs around the 
shop so you have the knowledge of a Master Mentor in the whole history of 
VW engines for backup and foundation. Instills very high confidence in the 
work. Of the many long blocks from them that I have installed I've had no 
problems at all but very few and minor issues jumped on and resolved 
immediately. Superlative business ethics one on one, on it's own, is worth 
a premium in my mind.

Give NW Connecting Rod in Seattle a call and see what they can do for you. 
Seek, and ye shall find. Tell Jerry I sent you.
