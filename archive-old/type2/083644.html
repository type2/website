Right on, man. 
I take 4th down to 40, but the other thresholds are
about the same.
My beast never sees WOT - especially on a
grade...which we both hate. She gets a nice
coast/cooldown on the other side if
allowed...sometimes we pull over if it was all just
too much...

230K? Wow. 
You guys should start a club...both of you!

&gt; There is only so much air you can blow through a

&gt; over 40 in third there is not enough air going

&gt; 
&gt; If my '73 1700 at 3/4 throttle will not pull a hill
&gt; at 45 in fourth, I
&gt; change to third and do 35.  If it wont pull the hill
&gt; at 30 in third I change
&gt; to second and do 23.  If it wont pull the hill at 17
&gt; in second I change to
&gt; first and do 12.  If it wont pull the hill at 8 in
&gt; first I change to reverse
&gt; and back down or turn around.  This way the engine
&gt; never overheats.  230,000
&gt; miles on original engine and still going strong.
