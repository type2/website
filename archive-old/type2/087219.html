Subject: Re: [T2] analyzer manual

Jeff,

Last time you? posted this I tried to go look for such a thing on the 
net...found zip.

Best thing to do is to go to your local Sears repair center and take it 
with you...they can more than likely get you a manual.

I say take it with you because the numbers you quoted don't match anything 
that I could look up on the Sears repair parts site on the net.
If it is sitting in front of them with the &quot;sears&quot; name on it, they can't 
deny it is was one of their items.

That is one of the things I like about sears stuff...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Last weekend I was given a Sears Penske Automotive
&gt; analyzer Model # 161.21042. Some of the functions
&gt;  I can figure out, but it sure would be nice to have a copy
&gt; of the manual. Does any one have a manual they could
&gt; copy or scan?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank You
