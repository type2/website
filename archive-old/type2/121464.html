Subject: Using Google to search the type2_dot_com site

I use Google to search the site and I get better results by doing so.  Using
Google to search with will include email posts and information from the
library.  The way to do this by adding site:type2_dot_com to the end of your
search phrase.  You can also use the template at
http://www.google_dot_com/advanced_search?hl=en and just type in type2_dot_com in
the Domain.  This will search only that domain.  Can be useful also for
searching the bus-boys site.

Hope this helps,

Ted Kitch
