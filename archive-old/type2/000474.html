In addition to this place a momentary contact switch (normally open) in the
circuit and the other end to B+ so that you can apply voltage to the relay.
This will let you start your van from the motor compartment (if that where
you mount the remote switch) when necessary, but only when the key is in the
ignition, in the on position. Turn the key off and you can turn the engine
over without firing, (ie compresion test, etc). Below is a schematic for
this. Everything including the wire and the heatshrink cost around $15.00.
NOTE: Ignition switch wire which used to go to pin 30 on the starter now
fires the relay.

 GND              (radio shack)


   ...I finally had to do it in the pouring rain I went for
methoid two which is install a relay so thet the starting button/switch just
turns on the relay and the relay connects the Solenoid straight up to the
battery eleminating the long wire run.
