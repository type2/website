&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I have a '72 Westy and I recently upgraded the carbs
&gt;from stock to a set of Weber 40 IDFs.

&gt;Am I looking at having to drill and tap my new manifolds
&gt;for the new hookup?  If so, I'd like to know the proper
&gt;placing of it on this new style manifold.


Yes, that would be the clean way to go. I would tap the manifold about 2 
inches below the throttle plate down to mid way from carb to head. You only 
need to tap one manifold, however, it would be a very nice enhancement to 
tap them both and run a balance tube between them, with a tee fitting for 
the vacuum booster hose. Both manifold taps should be plugged when doing 
all carb adjustments and tuning. After you have the carbs balanced, then 
reconnect the balance tube to enhance smooth running.
