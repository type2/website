&gt; Dont forget to drain your compressor /tank/ every few days of use during
&gt; the humid months, too.

Unless you have a huge tank on your compressor--60 gallons or higher, which
if you can swing the extra few dollars, the space to mount it, a 220v line
to run it and permission from your spouse is the way to go--drain your
compressor's tank every day you use it.

We have a 100-gallon tank on the biggest compressor at the printing plant I
work at (many systems on a large press run on compressed air) and we drain
it for five minutes every day and completely on Friday. The little
compressors on most of the presses get drained every shift. It seems to
help; the oldest compressor's tank was made in 1972 and it's working fine.
