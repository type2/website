Subject: Re: [T2] Hooking up brake servo w/ Dual Webers

Pardon me... My mistake... It DID hook up to a part
directly below the carburator, before it branched off
into seperate manifolds... I don't really know what
that tube coming from the filter did. It wasn't a heat
assist.

My bus isn't here right

&gt; hook up to the manifolds, but to the underside of
&gt; the
&gt; chamber where the filter is. &gt;
