     Better pull the hub and take a look, it's not that hard. The
bearing is probably going dry. I've &quot;fixed&quot; them temporarily by using a
&quot;grease needle&quot; on my grease gun and inserted thru the outer bearing
itself to fill the hub with grease again. It lasts for awhile, depends
upon how bad the bearing actually is. What happens is that if the
bearing is bad, it runs hot, and so the new grease gets melted and runs
out, but it gets you by until you have time to fix it.
      And putting in new bearings isn't that bad anyway -- forget  what
it says in Bentley about taking the hub and everything off the car and
using a press. Just get a BFH and some appropriate sized blocks of good
solid oak, maybe a brass drift punch.
