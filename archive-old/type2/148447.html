&gt; Has anyone on the list used the Schofield windshield repair parts,

&gt; sheet metal to repair from the edge of the Schofield panel down  
&gt; into the nose (1/2 to 3/4 inch or so)? If so, I would be interested  
&gt; in learning how you went about it.

I just used the gutter repair pieces...

bought 29B and had it trimmed to my needs:
