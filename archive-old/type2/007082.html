Hi Victor
The oil plate you refer to will fit in any Type 4 engine but you dont
really need one in a bus. It was used in 914`s to prevent oil surge
under hard cornering causing loss of oil pressure. If you try cornering
a bus hard enough to cause oil surge you will get very frightened!. I
have never seen a 914 with an oil temp guage. It is not difficult to
install a VDO oil temp except ffor running the wire up front. However,
there are extra unused wires in some models (Vanagons) that run from
rear to front but you will have to do some heavy detective work with the
wiring diagrams to find them.
Good Luck, Jack
