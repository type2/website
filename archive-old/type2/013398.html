Subject: be aware of your jack's lifting height
X-Diagnostic: Not on the accept list
X-Envelope-To: type2

Hi All, A lesson learned from a trip across the
mountains this weekend.  After the thrill of a blowout
after running over a piece of metal on the freeway, I
discovered my after market bottle jack working on the
slope of the freeway shoulder went only high enough to
take off the flat tire, but not high enough to
accomodate for the axel dropping.  It required the
kind assistance of the Washington State Patrol and
another jack to lift the axel a few inches to put on
the spare.  Lesson learned: if you can not find the
original jack, keep a couple of 2x4s around to give
the extra lift underneath the replacement bottle jack
and smile when the troopers stop by your stranded bus.
