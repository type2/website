Subject: Westy sink/icebox unit questions



&gt; So I thought I'd rehab my sink/icebox unit.  It turns out I'm missing
&gt; several things:
&gt;
&gt; Water fill tube and cap for water tank.

I have both.

&gt; Drawer under sink (so Bently says..I've never seen one)

??  Not sure what you mean.

&gt; Ice drain tray (never seen one of these either).

I have one and the hose for it.
Do you have the white metal rack to hold the ice? It sits above the tray. I
have one.

&gt; Also, the hinges on the workspace table (the one that flips over the
&gt; sink) seem to be bent.  It wont lie flat either way.  Does this rest on
&gt; something?

I have a good table with good hinges. There are 2 different material colors
used: solid white and white with fine black lines. The table top I have is
solid white.

And if anyone else needs an ice drain tray.... I have another one w/hose.
They crack real easy.
