Subject: re: [T2] '72 Dual Carb Install

Some picture here, i can send you more if you want Jay!

I think i know which carb you bought, like you said, we'll see!!!!!
The Solex are a pain in the but, period!
So many thing can go wrong on those 30 years old carb that a perfect 
rebuilt is almost impossible!

I have a total of 14 used carbs, i can barely make 2 good one out of all 
those carbs.
When you will receive them, check the buterfly shaft, if loose...
throw them in the garbage or have them re-bush! if not, you will suck air 
from the shaft and an will never, but never have a good idle.
-The main regulator tube/needle (the long one) inside the left carb:

is always (75%) cracked!!!! 
-The accc. pump tube are always loose: (same picture, red arrow)
-Choke element are not openning enough!
- the replacement fuel level valve is...shitty.
http://www.letambourin_dot_com/westfalia_ben/rebuilt13.jpg 
-Most carb lower body part are not flat, the result is that air is being suck
between the lower carb body and the buterfly assembly.
-Worn acc. pump lever!!! on older model = bad design. 
(i just repaired and upgraded those with model airplane linkage!!!)

Well if you need advice, or parts for your 32/34 Solex, let me know, 
my garage is full of them. FREE.

Another trick! I re-bush my carbs using K&amp;S brass tubing found 
in any good hobby shop!!! You need to drilled the buterfly shaft body to do so!

You wrote:
&gt;&gt;&gt;do I need any gaskets&lt;&lt;&lt;
Yes, intake to carb and intake to engine!

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am putting together a Bus Depot&lt;&lt;&lt;
Buy 2 of those cheep rebuilt gasket kit, at least you will have the intake to carb
gasket and more important, the needle valve O-ring (3 per bag) 

Cheers, Ben 
ps.: i sincerely hope that those carbs were professionaly rebuilt!
If you need more picture just tell me!

I won a set of &quot;recently rebuilt&quot; (we'll see about that) original Solex
carbs for my '72 this past week on Ebay to install in place of my worn out
Brazillian Webers (which I can no longer get parts for).  Assuming that the
carbs are complete and ready to go, do I need any gaskets or RTV to mount
these to my engine, or is it just a &quot;turn a couple of nuts&quot; type of install?
The carbs were recently removed from a running 1700CC type IV and come with
manifolds and the original linkage.  I am putting together a Bus Depot
order, so I want to be sure to get all the parts I need all at once.
Also, does anyone have a good picture of these carbs installed on their
engine showing the linkage setup, or know where I can find one on the net,
or even better, scans of a Solex manual?  I am also converting back to the
OEM style aircleaner setup to get away from the ill fitting paper cleaners
that are on my carbs now, so I may need some hints about setting this up in
the near future as well.
