Subject: Re: [T2] New Bus Site  !!!

Thanks, Phil!

While we certainly don't aim to replace the Full Moon Bus Club site  
in any way, Marlaina and I had been talking about launching a new  
&quot;community&quot; site for Bus owners, and also launching a Quarterly  
Magazine/Newspaper along the lines of the U.K.'s Camper &amp; Commercial  
Bus publication for that same community.

We have felt the need for a U.S. version of such a magazine for quite  
some time, but were still in the planning stages for that when  
Marlaina asked me on Friday if I could launch the Buscapades_dot_com site  
early (WAY early) so that we could host some refugees from the Full  
Moon group.

So, with that in mind, please feel free to join us at Buscapades_dot_com.  
The aim of the site is to sort of aggregate as much Bus info as  
possible, working with all of you as part of that, and create a  
virtual space online for this family of Bus (and other VWs) owners to  
congregate. We have an incredible amount of server space and  
bandwidth available to our site, so it can grow without many  
technical issues. Any content contributions you wish to make will be  
greatly appreciated. Suggestions or comments are also appreciated.

Best,
Anton
