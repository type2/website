Subject: 79 shocks

OK.  I know this has been covered but the info seems to be conflicting.  I
am needing new shocks on my 79 std.  I am leaning :) (sorry) toward the
KYB's but have heard of very short life span.  What is the general opinion
on the best shock for the loafs?  I do almost all freeway &amp; around-town
driving here in Portland.  Thanks.
