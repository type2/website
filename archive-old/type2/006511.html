&gt; shudders like it is stuck and when it fall it bounces.  The PO said the
&gt; sender needs to be replaced and it would cost approx. $300.00 CDN to cut
the
&gt; access hole and fix it.  Is this the only way to correct my problem?  I


Funny you should ask. I am having a similar problem with my '79 and was
looking through the archives for an answer. While I don't know if the sender
is the problem, I did find one post relating to the replacement of the
sender and the hole cutting issue. Look up &quot;fuel guage sender unit&quot; and it
will return a post by a guy that claims he got his out without any cutting.
I haven't tried this but probably will soon.

Has anyone else been able to replace their sender without any cutting or
engine removing?

Love those archives

John
