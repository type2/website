&gt; Greetings from SoCal---
&gt;         I'll attempt to keep this brief.  I needed a new clutch and exhaust
&gt; recently on my '77 Westfalia, and as I had a few bucks amassed, decided to
&gt; also take care of all the stuff that I'd been meaning to do---seals, fuel
&gt; lines, motor mounts, heater boxes, linkage, etc.  I amassed all the parts
&gt; that I thought I would need (thanks Karl, Bus Depot) and took it to the place
&gt; that had been doing my big stuff for the last 12 years (I am definitely not
&gt; qualified to work on a type4).  While going through the engine, a large crack
&gt; through an exhaust valve guide was discovered.  At this point I should
&gt; mention that this was an absolutely unmolested motor with 155K, still with
&gt; great compression (135-ish all around), used a little oil, but ran perfect,
&gt; better than my old '71 on its best day.  ANYWAY, with several long trips
&gt; pending, I decided to spring for the Mark Stephens heads and do the rings
&gt; while we're at it.  You can see where this is headed---rod bearing shavings
&gt; were found, then a well-worn cam.  Time to split the case, gotta bore it,
&gt; might as well go to hydraulics, the full catastrophe.  I used the best stuff
&gt; available, but absolutely ran out of money and was forced to re-use my
&gt; pistons and cylinders---not a good thing, but I had no choice.
&gt;         So with great anticipation, I picked the thing up after weeks of
&gt; downtime and was immediately underwhelmed.  I now have about 2K on it (just
&gt; back from a pretty rugged Baja trip of about 1,000 miles), and have an engine
&gt; that I consider to be inferior in every respect to the one that I brought
&gt; in---it's noisier, has less power, and more vibration.  I know that cylinder
&gt; shims were used according to MSHP spec's (I even called them, and they
&gt; acknowledged that stock rebuilds &quot;may seem a little sluggish&quot;), but it feels
&gt; like it's running at about 90 lbs.  It also makes a weird growl under load
&gt; (possibly due to old p &amp; c's ?), and doesn't seem to idle consistently.
&gt; While I dearly wish that I could have sprung for the complete blueprint thing
&gt; and the counter-weighted crank and all that, I've been assured that
&gt; everything is well within factory spec, but the fact remains that my original
&gt; engine ran better and smoother, pulled better, got better mileage, all on
&gt; regular gas.  My wrench (a longtime, well respected VW-only shop) is
&gt; sympathetic and wants me to be happy, but as there's nothing overtly wrong
&gt; with it, doesn't really know what to do about it, as it still runs better
&gt; than most of the buses out there.
&gt;         I guess my question is whether or not my experience is typical for
&gt; this motor, or whether I should keep squawking to the shop.  Are all current
&gt; rebuilds deliberately de-tuned as this one seems to be (I never got a real
&gt; answer on why the rebuilds should have lower compression.  Perhaps so they
&gt; can offer that 100K warranty on the heads?)  I would love to communicate with
&gt; anyone with a similar engine and situation, and all comments welcomed.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for reading, Matt Q.
Matt:
1. You don't need a counterweighted crank to get it to run as good as it
did!
2. I have serious doubts from several clues- rod bearing shavings, bore
the case, cracked valve guide? these are not usual type4 problems. The
alleged well-worn cam , in my opinion, looks worse than it is, and would
probably run quite a ways yet.
3. Someone should run a compression test on this thing. With new rings,
the p&amp;c's couldn't be any worse than before. I think they've got
something screwed up. The compression test should at least piont to
whether it's inside or outside.
4. Any good shop that takes your money should at least be able to figure
out whether to shim down the compression ratio.
I'd almost be tempted to take it to someone else, just to get a more
objective opinion. I think these guys needed to make a boat payment
(thanks Tom and Ray)! Maybe a couple hundrred more and they'll put the
plug wires on in the right order?
Let us know what you find.
