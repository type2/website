Subject: RE: [T2] Bay seats

Hi Andrew,

If I remember correctly, the Vanagon seats only slide into the late bays 
(like 73-79 or so).  Also, the passenger seat on the 69-71 models has the 
old split-style attachment, so you'd have to weld seat tracks into that 
spot.  As for the driver's side, I think it's pretty specific to the 69-71s 
as well, though the sliders are there.

Good luck!
