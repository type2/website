&gt; Cheapest way is to get a 1 ft scientific glass thermometer for spot testing.
&gt; I have one that fits right in the dipstick tube perfectly.  Store it in its

Be sure to use a alcohol (red liquid) thermometer.  If you break a mercury
thermometer in the crankcase you'll have the toxic waste problem from
hell.  Mercury vapor is why the Mad Hatter was mad!

Also, thermometers come in various diameters.  The ones I use in my lab
are too large for the dipstick tube.

Finally, thermometers come in total immersion and partial immersion
versions.  You want partial immersion.
