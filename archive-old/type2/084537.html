Subject: VWs and fires

May not be applicable, but way back in 1970 a bunch of us (about 5) were 
riding around in the back seat of my friend's bug.

We noticed some smoke. Like there wasn't some smoke there already.

Then a bit more. It started smelling bad.

And then our hind-ends felt warm!

We pulled over into a McDonald's parking lot and jumped out cause the thing 
was on fire.

We pulled the smoking back seat and threw it out on the asphalt.

Turns out the battery posts were uncovered and the weight of all us kids in 
the back seat shorted the battery out on the seat frame metal causing the 
seat fibers to ignite!!

I guess the moral of all these stories is that we best not ignore that 
plain and ugly battery.

P.S. I will put the rebuilt engine into our bus today. Will make sure we 
tie down the battery!!!!

Bill and Erik
