Subject: Safety Inspection tomorrow, send your positive bus karma this
	way, please.

Finally, I have all my front brakes together.  What a problem that was.  I
now have a complete '73+ system.

I am getting my Virginia safety inspection tomorrow.  I need all the good
karma that I can get.

I have taken care of everything that I can think of.  all lights work,
brakes should be perfect.  Tires okay, safety belts all there and working,
no exhaust leaks that I can find.

I am a bit worried that I may get dinged for the steering box.  No problems
there but there was a scratched out note on the inspectors note last year
for the steering box, so I am a but worried.

Many thanks to this list for all those mightily useful tidbits.  My brakes
have never worked as well as now.
