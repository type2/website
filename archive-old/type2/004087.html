Subject: Braking...wheel lock...

I sent out an SOS a while back regarding my '72 bus and one of the rear
wheels (hard to tell which one) locking very consistently in medium to hard
braking.

Many kind folks suggested replacing all the brake hoses, which I did.

Now, after replacing the brake hoses, and rebleeding, I'm still experiencing
the lockup. Curses!

I hate to replace parts willy-nilly, but how should I proceed?  The
emergency brake sticks a lot, but reading the archives indicates this is
fairly common in wet weather.

I have recently replaced the left rear wheel cylinder because it leaked, but
even though I knew I should have, didn't replace the right one.  Should I do
that first?

How do I test the master cylinder?

I have two young children and don't have much time anymore to work on my
bus...which I rebuilt the engine on myself to last nut and bolt ten years
ago.

Can someone point me in the right direction...maybe to a reputable repair
shop in the Richmond/Charlottesville,VA area?

Thanks.
