Subject: Re: Engine options: New Block, New Turn Key Engine, Get a Rebuild

&gt;I have a '77 Camper and a 1600 engine in it that a PO put in while in
&gt;Mexico, that just won't go anywhere that looks like a hill or a bump
&gt;for that matter. It doesn't have heater boxes. It has a brand new  carb
&gt;
&gt;and distributor.
&gt;

&gt;etc etc

I gather that your talking about replacing with a Type IV 2 litre (as
opposed to a type I 'big bored and stroked' 2 litre?)...

If the 1600 is already there with all the appropriate tin etc I think I
would offer the following compromise......buy a Type I 1776 longblock with
hydraulic lifters from whoever (I know rebuilding yourself is good but
perhaps to large a first step for a menchanical novice with no
shop)......pay a little more to add a full flow filter/external cooler set
up...

Last time I looked I think GEX (or whoever, easy now Schwarzey) offered a
1776 hydraulic long block for around $800 exchange.....Bernie Bergmann also
seems to have been offering *great* deals on 1776s with hydraulics
lately?.....

In terms of gaining a little mechanical experience,  spend the dollars that
it would cost to get it put in on some tools (and a floor jack) and swap
the miscellaneous stuff (carb, manifolds, exhaust etc) over yourself and
put it in yourself (do you have a uncovered space available to work
in?).......it's not hard and should take no longer than two weekends for
the inexperienced...

The 1776 should propel you up an off ramp at 50 (what's wrong with 35
anyway? 8-)...
