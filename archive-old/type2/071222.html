There's always the idea that the starter could be trashed.

A local shop put 4 starters, the relay kit and new ground leads into my 
GF's '78 automatic before finding out that there were teeth missing on 
the torque converter, and this was trashing the starters.

-the symptom was intermittent starting and a very occasional grinding 
noise.

The grinding noise was due to the missing teeth...
