&gt; Hey Guys,

&gt; I was looking at a type one motor today.  It does not want to idle.
&gt; It feels like it is fuel starved...
&gt;
&gt; Should the fuel filter have air in it once the motor has started?

Yes it may.  My filter often has just a bit of fuel splashing around in
the lower part, yet the carb remains full.

If the car runs OK off idle, then the filter isn't the problem.  More
likely you have debris in the idle circuit of the carburator.
