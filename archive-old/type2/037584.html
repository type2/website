List friends who live in/near Delaware....

I've heard there is a salvage yard with high VW content, near the
Ciba-Geigy plant, maybe around Newport?  Can anyone confirm?

If so, would appreciate name, better fix on location, etc.  Any
experiences dealing with them would certainly be helpful.   Thanks a
million (10**6 thanq).
