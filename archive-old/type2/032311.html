Subject: type 4 engine parts interchange

I cracked my 1800 case while installing it in my bus. I was tightening up
the upper left bolt and something must have got caught up. I heard a pop
and saw that the  upper left part had cracked right down the side of
the case.

                       D'OH!

ah well...... rebuild time (it was needing a rebuild pretty bad)


Since the incident, I've been putting together some parts that I have had
in boxes. Ironically, I just bought a 2.0L case from a '78 bus for a
seperate project, which is going to have to wait. The new case is going to
be the start of the rebuild.

I also have a 2000cc crankshaft. Can I incorporate the 2000cc crankshaft
into the rebuild? I'm sure I would need different rods, which ones?? I ask
because the bigger crankshaft is in much better shape, Im sure than the
one in the 1800. Is it possible to use the 2000 crankshaft with the stock
1800 pistons? and will the 215mm (1800) flywheel bolt to a 2.0 crankshaft?
Reliability is more of an issue than performance. I am happy with an
1800, but a little boost of power at a low cost would be nice.

What recommendations would anyone have while I do this. Are there any low
cost things I can do to juice it up a bit?
 This will be my second Type4 rebuild, I rebuilt a 1700 all stock and was
very happy with its outcome.


Thanks,
Eddie


PS...could a machine shop fix a busted case? I don't know what the deal is
with an magn/alum case.
