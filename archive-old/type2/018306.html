This may be of interest to list menbers in the area ( if you're not
&quot;showed out&quot; from Bugfest last weekend in Manassas), I just heard about
this event....Sunday June 6th (rain date June 27th) at the Capital City
Speedway in Ashland (south of Kings Dominion). This is listed as the 2nd
annual show (didn't hear about it last year). It appears to be an
air-cooled show, catagories for best bus, best bug, etc...no wasser
pumpers. If anyone is interested, p-mail me for directions, etc. I'm
gonna check it out, since it's soooo close, will file a report if that's
ok. Also, there's a # for info, 804-798-4490. I'll be there with the red
Westy (not entered, just checking out the scene), think I'll leave my
love beads at home     ;-p  .
