Subject: Tire Size Question

Hey guys,
 
    I have the stock OEM steel wheels on my transporter. I'm considering
getting new tires, what is a GOOD size to have? I'd like something that will
give me low rpms on the highway, but still give me decent handling. Not that
I careen around corners... but I want something tall so that my gears aren't
winding out at highway speeds, and I'd like something that isn't skinny and
narrow that'll cause my ride to be.. well.. scary.
 
Any ideas?
 
 
Thanks,
