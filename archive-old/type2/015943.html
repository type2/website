I like to believe that too, and last week I tried it.  When I started the
engine both sides leaked from the bottom front corner.  The covers are true
and I was careful that the gaskets were put in straight.  I would love for
someone to tell me why I can't get my valve covers to seal, but if that
doesn't happen I am going to be forced to pull them this weekend and apply
a layer of permatex to both sides.  I really dislike having oil all in and
over my heat exchangers!  Maybe I need to polish the sealing surface of the
heads like I did with the intake port flanges and pushrod tube bores?
