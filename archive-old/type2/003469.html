Went out to my bus today only to find that some low life had spattered Brake
Fluid all over the back of my bus resulting in meltdown of my paint on the
bumper tail gate engine lid left corner etc etc .I suppose theres no poimt
to this rant but letting off steam is sometimes good therapy-do i have
grounds for homicide and would I get away with it if i was in the
States.Sorry 'bout this but on a lighter note anyone know how to fix aclock
in a'71 or is it possible to fit alater quartz movement?-regards my
brothers,Mungus '71 bus &amp; '69 bug.
