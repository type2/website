Subject: Rocker arms, oil ports

   I have never seen this mentioned on the list's so I will pass this on.

On assembly of the rocker arms for a new engine do you check the oil
passages? After letting the rocker arms soak over night in Carb cleaner, I
finished off cleaning them getting them ready for reassembly on the rocker
shafts, on checking the oil ports, 1 goes to the adjuster screw and the
other to the rocker shaft push rod cup, I found half the rocker arms to have
plugged oil passages to the adjuster screws. This is a very important
operation . If I wouldn't have done this half of my adjuster screws would
not have been getting oil, causing premature wear on the valve stems and
would also make it noisier on one side then the other. 
The point I'm trying to make is always check the rocker shaft oil ports when
doing a rebuild, changing heads or just having valve train problems. Again
this is a procedure I  do on a rebuild and wanted to pass this on to you
do-it-yourselfers.
