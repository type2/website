Subject: Re: [T2] Chrome plating...now I know!

Robert,

You might consider powder coating.  It's never gonna look like
&quot;real&quot; chrome, but not too bad either.  Go look at the local powder 
coaters after they do a run of &quot;chrome&quot; with hi gloss.

Go look at eastwoodco_dot_com and look at some of their &quot;hi-tech&quot; colors.


I powder coated my tailpipe with hi-temp powder coat and it still looks
the same after about 400 miles...same for my heater boxes and their 
manifolds...even up close to the heads.

Cheers, dave

&gt;  What are suitable alternatives?  I have a nickel 
plated exhaust pipe for my '72.  
I have not yet installed it and I do not know how 
long it will last ($15 from E***).  
I also would like shiney bumpers.  Is nickel plating possible and/or a good idea.
&gt; 
&gt; I also have had items rhodium plated, I cannot remember how much 
that cost, but I doubt that is practical for car parts.
