Subject: Very large oil leak help requested

Hi,

 

I have been losing about 1 Litre per 50 KM's of oil.

 

When hot, the engine drips a lot.

 

When cold, seems fine, only a small drip.

 

Pulled Oil filter, seemed fine, was done up tight. Dirt resting in the
outside of filter body.

 

Checked my work on my push rod tube install.

 

Only a slight amount of oil on last push rod tube at engine. These were just
replaced using assembly grease from german supply (really nice stuff BTW, I
could not believe how well it worked. I used the same grease to push a seal
on behind the fan. A very light film of what is obviously the assembly
grease in the tin. From the back, no problem with back seal. Looks clean and
nice.

 

The oil cooler only has a tiny bit of oil at the upper front corner.

 

Hot, Oil drips toward the front of van, cold, drips off the filter.

 

I am going to waste a cheap filter as a troubleshooting measure.

 

I have a tiny bend in one push rod on the number 3 cylinder.

 

It has obviously been bent for a long time.

 

I really don't want to do things too fast or I will &quot;shotgun&quot; the fault and
not know what it was.

 

I find myself wanting to run it after cleaning it, with no tin and watching
for the first drip.
