Subject: Re: [T2] speaking of brakes

just yesterday I noticed that my brakes (78 auto tranny bus) seem to be
dragging when I'm going backwards. no evidence of any hang up in forward.
  everything else seems normal,  I tested it on a slight incline in
neutral, facing forward the bus drifts normally (I use this incline to
test other things too) but facing backwards the bus barely drift and comes
to an early stop...  wheels feel normal, but I mostly drive forward.

no other symtoms, new brake pads and shoes about 5,000 miles ago...

???

 thanks
Bob
