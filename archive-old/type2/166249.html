Subject: half of my intake popped off...

Well, I recently got my van back from underneath a diesel engine I was 
storing in it. 
It wouldn't stay running at idle, but I could keep it running with the 
pedal.  I figured it was a vacuum leak, and I was right.  What I didn't 
figure was that it was a vacuum leak because one half of the intake was 
loose.  I wonder if this could be a symptom of something else, like a 
bad valve or something that's putting extra pressure on the intake?  Has 
anyone experienced this?  I put the intake tube back in place and 
tightened it up, and sealed the vacuum port (the plug on this had also 
blown off, which is why I think there was a lot of pressure, and not 
just some loose bolts).  The engine still doesn't idle.  It's a 1600 
single port. 

Advice?  Thanks in advance... your help may get my van fixed in time to 
get to Jerome this year...
