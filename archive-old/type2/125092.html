Subject: head gasket removal

Folks,

I pulled the heater boxes off my '79 westy today and it went surprisingly
easy. All 8 nuts backed off perfectly and with a little wiggling the whole
exhaust fell onto my lap.

Two of the copper head gaskets even fell right out.

A tiny screwdriver got the third out, but I am having a bear of time getting
the fourth one out (Cylinder One if it matters). I do not want to damage the
head, obviously, and was wondering what is the best way to extract that
gasket without damaging the seat.

Collie
