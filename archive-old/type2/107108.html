Subject: Engine in, no start!

Newly rebuilt engine in, everything (hopefully) connected properly.  Turn 
key to first notch, lights come on, headlights work.  Turn key to second 
notch, no fuel pump noise.  Turn key all the way...nothing.

Connect + and - of starter solenoid with screwdriver --&gt; starter turns.  
Connect 50-type and 30-type connections on solenoid with jumper --&gt; engine 
cranks, but still no whirr from the fuel pump.

It's a '78 Westy with fuel injection. I seem to have an extra line to my 
starter's 30-type connection point (6 instead of 5 that book shows, I think, 
but it's raining out and I'm in no mood to crawl back under right now), and 
there's a box-type multi-wire connector (that has 50, 85, 85, and 87 wires 
labeled on it) that attaches to the heavy-gauge red (not red/black as the 
book shows) that goes to the solenoid's 50-type connector.

Does this make sense to anyone?  I'm thinking that my solenoid is bad, since 
bypassing it with a screwdiver will both turn the starter and even crank the 
engine, and my fuel pump is still getting no power from solenoid (I checked 
with a volt meter).  Should I remove starter and replace solenoid?

Thanks for the help,

Beth in Houston
