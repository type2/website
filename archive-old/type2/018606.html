Subject: Winner is...brake servo!
Message-ID: &lt;376E3D4C.2D66EDF3_at_west_dot_net&gt;

After endless poking around, I discovered the source of my low idle miss
on cylinders #1 &amp; #3...it was the vacuum servo for the brakes. There is
a vacuum fitting on the #1 &amp; #3 intake manifold that I traced back to
the servo line...which wasn't connected at all!

Still seem to have a leak in the servo somewhere. Symptoms  are stiff
brakes and increased engine idle when I mash on the brakes. If anyone
has experience with this phenomena I'd like a few pointers. The symptoms
are in the archives, but no answers.

Thanks.
