Subject: Person coming through Kodiak????

Someone wrote to me that he was going to be passing through Kodiak on a
quest next summer. I lost the post, sorry. If you try again I will strive to
keep better track of it ... (Everyone else, please forgive me for posting
this to the list.)

Love, Lotus (Flower of the North)
