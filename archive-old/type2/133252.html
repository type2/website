&gt; I'm posting this message for everyone involved--so the last message I
&gt; posted on this is clearer--

my feeling is that as we get closer I'll send photos of my bus, and what I
want to do....you tell me what and how much to get and I'll get it and
bring it.....

&gt; would want that to be replaced as used.

I have one of those things and a few extra rolls of paper I haven't used,
house painting but same tool

&gt; You guys choose the site--and the material's---line it all out---and
&gt; I'll appear ready to go--

thanks

Bob
