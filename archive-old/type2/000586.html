hello list,
  im new here, but not new to the vdub world.  I'm looking to buy  a 68
bayfront which has been sitting since 1984, not running but will turn over.
I guess im just looking for any information on whether this will be a good
investment or not.  by the way he only wants 500 for it.

 thanks in advance for any info and guidance you can give me.
Hope to see alot more of all of you.    Jon
