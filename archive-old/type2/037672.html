Subject: Automatic HELP!.. &amp; to Jason B

Hey all.

Hey Jason, I had the same problem in my dash. I had a tiny tiny leak in the windshield and I fixed it before it cut things out. I talked to many people who have had those tiny leaks. I would tell everybody you see to look behind that particle board stuff under the dash and look for a pool of water in the bottom (I actually HEARD the water when I first bought it!).

Question #2

Okay folks dont laugh. I have had this 73 automatic for some time and have taken it MANY miles. I did as you all suggested to check the shifting and vacumes etc. BUT I have this feeling (one that I have learned to trust) that this the tranny is...shall we say, &quot;ready to do somthing&quot;. It does sound like the engine is kind of at to high an RPM at 50 to 55mph..I dont even know if this is &quot;normal&quot;. I need to know what to look and hear for from and automatic that could be ready to crash. Does it make sounds that are characteristic of DOOM ready to unfold? I have had no real troubles with it it is just that the car seems to have no &quot;bite&quot; like the engine is reving yet I am going slow (er)...like no &quot;zip&quot; (the engine is in good shape). Most people I talk to say...&quot;AUTOMATIC VW?&quot; 

I will rebuild if needed but man, I think it will be a hunt for the rite mechanic and parts!

Thanks!
Andrew K
