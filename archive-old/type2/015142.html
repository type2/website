Subject: Eberspacher BA-6 parts/repair stations??
Mime-Version: 1.0


List,

I consider myself very fortunate (thanks Tobin!) to have acquired a
BA-6 Eberspacher gas heater, albeit with a few missing parts and in
unknown operating condition.  Since these things were regularly installed
in Canadian-bound type 2s, I've tried to locate parts and service stations
in Canada to no avail.  JB's got a few parts in Castle Rock, CO but he's
much more into the Stewart Warner burners.  

Can anyone help out with parts sources and/or repair persons here??  I know 
I need some hoses, clamps, etc. and I'm soon to find out what else.  TIA
