Subject: Westy Roof racks?

Hey list!
         I have a question!  I have begun using my 74 westy as a work vehicle 
for the time being and have been working out of it. My new job as a 
subcontractor for Time warner requires me to carry a ladder on top. ( Boy you 
should see the looks!)  Anyway, I noticed that the ladder was moving the 
rubber seal  around on top of the roof. Is  it possible to make wooden racks 
to fit in the grooves on top of the camper, and if so how would I bolt them 
on? Or am I going down the wrong road here and maybe there is aftermarket 
racks that fit westys?  I don't know, but I do know that the rubber seal is 
becoming fubarred. 
BTW who else works out of their van besides me?  I find it quite comforting! 
And lunch is no problem with that handy stove right there!
Thanks in advance!

weekend and I tell ya he is one COOL dude!  If yall ever get the chance to 
catch up with him do it!
