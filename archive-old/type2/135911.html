Subject: Brake Caliper and Pads

HEY,

I spent today trying to replace front brake pads on my '71 Camper.  Is there 
a trick on retracting the pistons in the calipers?

Do I need a special tool?  
Do I need push both side at the time, can I do one at time?
And how much force is required to do this?
