Sorry i didn't get this Friday post in sooner, gots to makes the money ya
know.

Seriously though, I posted this last Friday, had 5 or so serious replys, I
will post it again, please p mail me if interested, If there is enough
interest, I will set up shop to do this. (don't worry, this is a mostly not
for profit deal) ( just got to cover the expenses) any way here is the
original post, I think I might have lost some replies due to the mail snafu
last week.
Happy Bussing!

Hey gang. 
	This is a thought that I've been thinking about for a while. We all seem
to have a name for our buses. We use these names to praise our vehicles (or
cuss them out) because they are a part of us and we trust them. Coming from
a family that used to name their airplanes, we commenly refer to them as
family members instead of just mere machines. What I'm getting at (and
since it's Friday albeit late) I think it would be really cool to have a
similar naming sceme on our vehicles as they did with bombers in World War
II (for example: Memphis Belle). I would be willing to develop magnetic art
for those who didn't want to mess up their paint job. And/or templates for
people that it didn't really matter, to portray their affectionate names on
their buses on the driver's side door. In a bus rally situation it would be
really neat to see the bus name on the side of the door, giving it
personality and name recognition to the driver/pilot. Any thoughts??

Still Friday, Still thinking,
Thanks for your time.
