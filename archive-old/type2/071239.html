So let me get this straight:
- you have only ever had one problem with your FI that was (presumably)
fixed by aimless fiddling
- you think this one problem that caused you a few minutes of
inconvenience gives you reason to change to carbs
- you can't afford to &quot;have too much down time&quot;

Maybe it is just me, but I reckon you should take a few minutes and
think about the situation. :)  If nothing else, you're going to be in
for &quot;down time&quot; changing over to carbs, as well as possibly discarding a
FI system that is completely operational, save for a small problem.

From my experience, &quot;down time&quot; is part of the bittersweet VW
experience, and something that is entirely necessary if you also want
those days where everything is running smooth, the roads are almost
empty and you feel like driving for hours on end...
