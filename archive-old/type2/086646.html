Subject: Lower L/H Ball Joint Removal (?)


Hello,

On my inspection last Friday I got snagged for the Lower L/H Ball Joint - I
understand there is too much play.

(1) Is there a way to tighten this up without replacing the Ball Joint (?)
(2) If I need to replace, is it true that it's not necessary to follow the
Bentley procedure?  Has anyone tried to heat it up (as mentioned in the
Library) and then whack it out?  Can I do this job for the first time by
myself?  Do I need the press as per book?

Thanks in advance,
Shawn
Montreal, Qc
Close to passing inspection on my '73 - 6 Snags remaining.
