&gt; &gt; This really gets at my quandary. What does &quot;work better&quot; mean? If a

&gt; &gt; the sealant have to do?

&gt;I understand what you mean, but I don't have the answer. All I can say is
&gt;the few engines I have assembled with the 574 do not leak, therefore I am
&gt;sold. It is fairly rare to have engine case halves that are 100% leak free
&gt;no matter what you use, but this stuff works.


More info from Pelican Parts Website.

Loctite 574 Case Sealant
The Loctite 574 sealant is an orange gooey sealant that cures in the absence 
of air. When you assemble your case and mate the case halves, you will have 
some squeeze-out that will collect at the case halves. If you leave this 
excess sealant exposed to the air, you will find that it will not harden. 
While this may cause you some head scratching, you shouldnt be concerned, 
as the sealant is designed to seal within tight clearances, and between 
metal surfaces. Despite the fact that it appears that the Loctite 574 is not 
curing because the squeeze-out has not hardened, it has in fact properly 
sealed between your two case halves.


Maybe this will help.
