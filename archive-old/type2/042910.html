Subject: RE: Quaife Differential for the 091?

I have been interested in the Weddle diff but local trans builders I have
talked to haven't been familiar and assumed that it would be $$$. I didn't
realize it was reasonably priced. Does it require any special tools to
install (besides the normal tranny tools). What is the MTBF for the Weddle
unit? How long does the loud click-clack last?

I was camped on a grassy hill in the rain this weekend and having something
like that would have made my departure much less dramatic (getting a
running start and barreling across a 45 degree incline at the top of 1st
gear while dodging other cars doing the same thing).

&gt;I recently had an interesting conversation with Chris at Weddle Industries
&gt;(used to be Weddle Engineering).  To get &quot;more and better&quot; traction out
&gt;of the 091 transaxle you can buy an OEM ZF limited slip unit or the Lock
&gt;Right from Weddle.  The ZFs are all used over here (rumor is that there
&gt;are some NOS in Germany)and cost about $900+.  The Lock Rights fully
&gt;lock/unlock and clik-clack pretty loudly, especially when new (ask me
&gt;how I know).  They do provide good traction for under $300 (for the part)
