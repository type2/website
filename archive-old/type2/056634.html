New babies don't come free, so I need to raise some cash. If you don't
like the price feel free to shoot me an (reasonable) offer. Discounts
given for bulk purchases. You pay the actual shipping cost. Items
located in Kansas. Minimum $5 purchase. I will accept money orders and
personal checks. I will hold merchandise until check clears.
