I have a 1600 Dual Port.  It ran fine but the carb was old so I wanted to 
get a new one.  So I just put in a new carb.  Seems to be low in power after 
the carb was put on, so I did a tune up which helped a little.

Then the oil light came on at idle only. This was about 2-3 weeks after the 
carb was replaced. So then I replaced the sensor and cleaned the  relief 
valve??(the screw at the bottom of the case).  The oil light still goes on 
at idle ONLY.  Never while driving.  I took it to always vw and did an oil 
pressure test and it has zero reading at idle.

The engine was rebuilt about 30,000 miles ago.  The valves were recut.  At 
the time I didn’t know too much about the inside of an engine(and still 
don’t).  So I don’t remember what else was done on the engine but I would 
assume they pulled it all apart and inspected everything.  What does a top 
end rebuild consist of?

Does this sound normal?  The compression check was over 110 all the way 
around.  Can it be the oil pump?  How do I check that.  (Couldn’t find 
anything in the library)

Any advice?
