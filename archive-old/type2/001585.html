&gt;&gt;Question is: How do you install test things? There are no bolts or clips.
&gt;&gt;Do
&gt;&gt;they mount on the inside or outside?

&gt;As far as I know, 78-79 sliding windows never came with factory screens. I
&gt;have seen [twice in the past 5 years] aftermarket screens that used long
&gt;screws hold them on the outside. They would go thru the aluminum screen
&gt;frame and into the rubber seal around the window frame.
&gt;
Taking a closer look at what you said, looks like they must mount from the
outside. After messing with these things every which way, it looks like
there is a major hurdle to contend with when mounting from the inside, doh!,
can't open window! at least not with these screens. I can't bring myself to
drill holes and install long screws through the rubber into the sheet metal.
Seems to me this would be a major introduction to rust in about two years
time.

Thanks everyone who responded...
