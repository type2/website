		I would agree but would go one step further.  If your driving
your bus 10 to 15 thousand miles a year I would think it standard to 
replace them every 3 years.  Just a good preventive measure.  The cost
of the two cables is so minimal compared to breaking down in a bad 
situation I would think it's worth it.  I replaced mine on the 'unknown'
bus I bought as a matter of course.  Mostly because of you guys and 
your previous experiences.




&gt;I put them back in with plenty of grease, I like to use CV joint grease. 



I used grease but can't figure out why everyone says to.  They slid in 
just fine without grease during the trial fit.


 

&gt;spare.  I compare the newly replaced cable with the one I'm carrying as a 
&gt;spare and keep the best of the 2 as my spare.


Did That.


&gt;   This way I get to deal with the cables on my own terms.  You know, on a 
&gt;day it's not raining, during daylight hours, in the summer, and best of all 
&gt;in my own driveway.



Here, here.
