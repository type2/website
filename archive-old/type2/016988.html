FWIW, I think Ray Carter's right on the money.  Respect for others has
gone down the tube.

For those inclined to look at the problem from an esoteric/scientific
perspective, you may wish to review Dirk Helbing's work, at:

   http://www.theo2.physik.uni-stuttgart_dot_de/helbing/RoadApplet/

He and a colleague, Bernardo Huberman of Xerox PARC &quot;analyzed the
dynamics of traffic flow using numerical techniques.  They found that as
the density of traffic increases, the vehicles can spontaneously
organize themselves into a stable, highly organized state in which they
collectively move as a single block.  At higher densities, vehicle
motions again become chaotic (that familiar start-stop motion of a
traffic jam).
