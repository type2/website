Subject: Re: [T2] Re hydraulic lifter adjustments

     I agree with &quot;Vanagon Man&quot;'s claim that a hot engine will change
the cold set preload to a larger one, which is why I use one turn
in.....but keep in mind that in a nonhydraulic engine .004 valve
clearance cold is only a tenth of a mm and reduces to under that as the
engine heats up.  Obviously the best solution is to adjust to the
midpoint when the engine is hot....but it matters little if we are
talking only 0.1 mm difference.
    I will admit I haven't read Bostom Bob's rational and thus cannot
comment on it.  It's true that if your lifter is full of oil TO THE MAX
(piston against circlip) as in a &quot;new&quot; bled one, you'd likely see the
valve stem being pushed in.  (see below why this cannot be so in
operation).  But I can comment on the assumption that the maximum amount
of oil left in the lifter by allowing vey little preload allows minimal
resistance in the valve train.

Maximumum amount of oil is left in the lifter?  If what you say is true
about the lifter acting solid once oil is under the lower piston, it
doesn't matter how  much oil is in there, since oil is not
compressible.  It seems you are assuming that a &quot;pumped up&quot; lifter is as
long as it can get (piston to the circlip), which cannot be true in
operation if it is set 2 turns in and still lets the valve close!
There seems to be a mentality that any preloading is like turning your
nonhydraulic adjustor to zero and even further- damaging the valve by
not letting it close.  Whatever preload is set, it's to prevent the
piston from coming up too far while insuring accomodation for engine
dimension changes. Any change in engine dimensions will affect that
preload (move the piston slightly in or let it out) and the oil pressure
keeps the lash at zero.  
     When you stop the engine, a lifter is under least tension if not on
a raised cam lobe- but if is one whose valve is on an intake or exhaust
cycle, there is a lot of pressure on the piston, which will force oil
out around the lower piston if it can move down due to wear in the wall
and thus let air in the side hole.

 If the lifter is pumped up, the
&gt; pushrod will not press the plunger down in the lifter.....it acts as if it
&gt; were solid when pumped up.  the valve will open.  Watch the rockers when
&gt; doing the preload per the instructions at www.bostonengine,com  he explains
&gt; in great detail what to look for.......if when at the beginning of preload
&gt; your pushrod is compressing the lifter, it is not pumped up; if the valve
&gt; starts moving it is........thus the reason why he feels the 1/4 to 1/2
&gt; preload is optimum.............the maximum amount of oil is kept in the
&gt; lifter, and thus minimal resistance in the valve train.
