Subject: Oil leak at sending unit 71 type 1 engine
Date: Wed, 6 Sep 2000 15:23:53 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Recently installed combination oil pressure/idiot light sending unit  in
place of the original oil pressure switch.  Noticed a slight leak,  removed
it,  and used some Teflon tape on the threads, then  reinstalled.  Very
frustrating! Still leaking!   I have 0 tolerance for leaks or rattles in/on
a bus.

Read in the archives where Sean used some *Permatex* blue silicone on the
threads, and stopped the leak.  I am thinking of trying that, but,  was
wondering if it would be better to use a little *Fast Weld* epoxy putty on
the threads *as I have used on helicoiled engine case studs* to seal it and
stop the leak.  I know this is a tapered thread into the side of the case.
Hoping  I haven't screwed the sending unit in to far and compromised or
cracked the case.  Has anyone used something like this?  Would the epoxy on
the threads make it impossible to remove the unit in case of failure?

TIA

Bob
