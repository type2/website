Subject: Re: [T2] auxiliary air regulator

&gt; &gt; There is a small rubber elbow attached to it, about half an inch in
&gt; &gt; diameter.
&gt; before I found a junkyard one

It's on my list! I'm going treasure-hunting this weekend and I'll keep
an eye out. I've got a color photo of the innards of an FI engine
compartment, with an arrow to the aux air reg. I think I can figure it
out from there.

I'm also looking for heat shields (Bob's got dibs), and the usual dizzy
springs and heater box block-off plates.
