Subject: RE: How do I get my wiprers on the screen

Funny you should mention this, I was adjusting mine only the other day.
I have new wiper arms (SWF) as well as blades (Bosch Twin) and it's the
same on my bus.  I left the blades 'as is' so that the middle of the
screen is clear and the extreme RHS doesn't get wiped - I would rather
be able to see through the middle rather than the bottom corner, given
the choice.
If you are really bothered you could always bend the arm so as to apply
more pressure to the blade, but this will make the motor work harder and
the nylon gear inside the gearbox might start to slip on its shaft (it's
just a press fit on the '78 version, very poor engineering if you ask
me).

&gt; I replaced both wiper baldes recently and I get an untouched patch in
&gt; the middle
&gt; of the wipre because I have bent the wiper so it gets to the edge of
&gt; the screen
&gt; i.e. the very curved bit.
