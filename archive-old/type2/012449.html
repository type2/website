Chepachet, R.I.

This is a ground-up rebuild joint specializing in
classic Mustangs but doing everything including
fabrication of body panels.  Lots of before and
after pictures including some where I'd say the
picture was more solid than the chassis.

Any of youse done business with 'em?

Also, thinking of losing the sunroof -- any advice
on the pros and cons of making it go away as part
of my otherwise &quot;restore&quot; job?
