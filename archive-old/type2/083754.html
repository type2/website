Subject: New guy with carb trouble running again

--0-1698735843-1022419671=:14736


Thank you all for your inputs. Well I changed the needle and

 seat for my carb and checked all my clamps for booster vacuum, 

basically timed it by ear (Muir says 5 ATDC, thought I was doing 

something wrong because it wouldn't idle 10 BTDC works well), 

and have been driving it to work with no problems. Not too sure 

if it was vacuum or just a piece of something that finally let loose 

in the carb.

Thanks John for the link on timing, if I read the numbers on 

my distributor right I have a 040 in her.

Very happy with all the responses I received, more information is 

better than not enough. 

Thanks again,

Paul Saulsbury
