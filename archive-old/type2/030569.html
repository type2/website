&gt; have installed them since they didn't come into the picture until '78. My 
&gt; questions is, what is the part number for the seals for these? I am 
&gt; planning on stripping my bus to bare metal in the next year or so, and 
&gt; repainting, including replacing all seals, but I am not sure which seal to

Hi nick,

I *believe* they use the same seal as a Kombi side window. i/e for
stationary glass instead of the regular wing windows...

But im sure ron can fill us in...

take care,

Steve
