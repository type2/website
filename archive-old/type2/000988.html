Greetings..

I'm looking at a set of COFAP cylinders and pistons.  I know these are what
RMMW sells, but I was wondering if it worth going with a higher end product
like Mahle or CIMA and paying a bit more money?

I have nil experience with an engine rebuild, which is eminent on my 1600
dp.  Are the COFAPS perfectly adequate, or is it really worth spending the
significantly more cash on a higher end set of p&amp;c's?

Cheers,

Tom
