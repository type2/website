Subject: re: engine removal

Adam,

It is not necessary to remove the exhaust to pull the engine.  OTOH, since
you will need to remove it to pull the heads, you may very well be better
off removing it now from an access POV. That engine is *heavy* and to get
the exhaust off, you will need to remove the nuts from the studs there at
the exhaust ports.  While the engine is in the car, these are 16&quot; off the
ground, out of the car, they are 3&quot; off the ground.  Propping the engine
up to get access to the studs is a bear.  BTW, if you start soaking those
studs *now* with some light oil (WD-40), you will not regret it later :-)
OTOH, If you plan to put the block on some bench mounted stand or other
waist level holder, by all means wait.

Lastly, let me tell you that though the individual pieces of the system
are not too heavy, trying to release it as a unit is a real bad idea, as
it is a ~50lb. &quot;U&quot; of rusty, delicate, and expensive to replace metal; and
getting it off without it racking itself apart is near impossible.  Also,
once it's loose, getting it back on so you *can* take it apart is very
difficult (been there, done that..) Bad as it is, I recommend taking it
apart to the extent of removing the exchangers and muffler assembly as 3
separate units.
