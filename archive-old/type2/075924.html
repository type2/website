Subject: turn signal/dimmer switch

Does anyone out there have a turn signal/high beam
switch for a 1972 westie.  On my first voyage after
installing a new motor, I went to signal my left hand
turn and &quot;snap&quot;, the turn signal arm broke off in my
hand.  I've been trying to locate one through Rocky
Mountain Motorworks, but they have been out for quite
a while and don't know when more will come in.

Thanks in advance, my arms are getting tired from all
the hand signals and I feel sketchy about getting rear
ended.

Kurt Rogers
72 Westie
Madison, Wi
