&gt; heres a link to a pic I slapped up

    From that picture, I noticed that the bus hitch has a squared off bracket
on the forward end of it (I'm assuming that the bus hitch is the lower one in
the picture).  This is very interesting to me, because my bus, on the
crossbar under the engine, has that exact same threaded bracket on it, which
dangles there doing nothing but collecting oil.  I haven't removed it because
i didn't want to take the crossbar off.  Too bad my bumper is only held on by
three bolts (due to the fact that the fourth hole is no longer with us), or
I'd buy one.
