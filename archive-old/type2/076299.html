&gt; Would it make a difference if I had said the engine hadnt been run in about 

no

&gt; 10 years? The previous owner had said he couldnt get it running right, so 
&gt; thats why he gave up. The engine has dual Dollortos(sp) 40's. There was some 
&gt; sort of nasty looking thick rubber gasket between the carb and intake. Kinda 
&gt; thought thats why it might not have run right.

it doesn't run right because it is running on 3 cyl

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a friend that bought a Porsche 914 with a 1700 engine  and is 
&gt; &gt;trying
&gt; &gt; &gt; to adjust the valves (talk about a pain to get to).  He just emailed me
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem.  When I got to 3 I had a problem.  When I back out the
&gt; &gt; &gt; adjusting
&gt; &gt; &gt; screw the piston/spring followed.  No way to slip a feeler gauge in as
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; space kept collapsing. So, I doing something wrong or is the engine
&gt; &gt; &gt; busted?  Any ideas?&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;probably broken valve.  minimum it is pulling the head, possible rebuild
&gt; &gt;time if the valve went through the piston.
