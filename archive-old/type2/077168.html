Subject: Engine teardown order and time allowance

  I'm tearing down the 1600dp that I took out of the 65 yesterday.  It ran,
but compression in three cylinders was around 80, and I don't know the
history, so I decided to try my first full teardown/and maybe rebuild.

I would like to know if it is wise to start this process knowing full well
it may drag out over a few months, or more, while I learn, and explore.

So far, I've got the generator and fan, carbs, and all exhaust off.  I just
bent a six foot piece of 1 1/2  angle iron to a 135 degree angle trying to
get the gland nut off with a ten foot cheater and all my weight on it.  So
i've stopped.  Thought it was time to seek some collective list wisdom.

I'd like to get the motor up onto the bench stand I just got for xmas, and
really see what's going on inside.  I want the flywheel off before I do
this, but is that like a point of no return?  I envision some of the parts I
take off sitting for extended peroids of time.  I've got Muir, Bentley, the
Bug Me videos, and of course the list, and for what it's worth, used to
rebuild lawnmower motors and sell them for $20 when I was a kid.  Three
years ago,  I tore down the motor  in my other bus (also a 1600dp) just a
litttle farther than I am now in one day, but then brought it to a local
mechanic and had it rebuilt.   As always, any and all advice on where to go
from here appreciated.

Thanks
