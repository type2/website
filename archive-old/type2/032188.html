I'm torn between two submissions, so I'll mention both.

- A small, flat pry bar with a right angle bend in one end.  There's a
special name for one of these, but I forget what it is.  One about 8&quot; long
is great for prying down those spring bails on the valve covers, and for
getting them back on, too.  Forget using the ends of a couple wrenches
like Muir says, this takes about a tenth of the time.  You can also use it
for general-purpose prying, saving your screwdrivers from getting bent.

- Sports-type halogen head lamp.  No, not for your bus...the kind that
straps on *your* head.  Sure beats holding a flashlight in your teeth.
The one I have has a rubber bump guard around the lens and an adjustable
beam angle.  Awfully handy when you can't use a trouble light.
