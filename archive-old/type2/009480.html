Dear Volks-
	I've got one for all of you guys.  My buddy's aunt just past away and
when they were cleaning out her farm house my buddy found her old 71 Bus
in the barn.  His dad told him it has been sitting there for over 15
years.  It is complete and oh so beautiful.  My question is.  How do we
get it started?  It has been sitting for so long that the pistons are
probably frozen.  How do we get it running without tearing the engine
apart?  We were told to put mystry oil down the plug holes for a week and
let it seep in and loosen the pistons.  Do you folks have any advice?

thanks in advance

Chuck
