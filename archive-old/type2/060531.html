Subject: Re: More Bosch -- Alternator report, SoCal Imports report (very
 very  	long)

&gt;the ___ Bosch Ultimate Protection Plan! ___ -- which boils down to a &quot;24
&gt;hours a day, 365 days a year, anywhere in U.S. or Canada&quot;

Because they are highly confident it isn't going to fail. I think Hoover
says somewhere that an alt will last around 6 times as long as a gen,
probably based on Bosch expected service hour specs. That's a new gen, not
&quot;rebuilt&quot;.

&gt;So Southern California Imports sells a complete &quot;Alternator Conversion Kit&quot;
&gt;for $120 ($10 of which is core fee, why bother?).  This includes the stand /
&gt;alternator / strap / pulley / tin.

(Tin?) Three other issues: you need a different fuel pump (somebody told me
not long ago he had crammed an early fuel pump in there somehow but the
rest of us use an &quot;alternator&quot; fuel pump.

You need a different fuel pump rod to go with it. They really should supply
or at least tell you this because it's not obvious.

And your carb linkage will now interfere with your alternator body in such
a way that the throttle will stick open (bad thing &lt;tm&gt;). I've heard that
there is such a thing as &quot;alternator linkage&quot; and this makes sense if the
alt was standard on any carbureted Type Is, but I've never seen it. You can
clearance the alternator case (which is what I do) but it's sort of a pain
in the ass. However the alternative is grim. 8)

I think you'll be happy with this mod, I have alternators on both buses and
I never think about them, they just keep going. Meanwhile count the
generator and voltage regulator woes on the lists...

Also when you start the bus the red light will go on and stay on until you
goose the throttle. This is normal, do not worry about it, everything is
fine.

I'm useless about the Woodruff key, just don't know.
