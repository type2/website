Subject: What's up your heat ducts?

Ever look to see what the PO's kids might have shoved up your rear heater 
ductwork? I found: two pens, an open book of matches, and a bottle cap.
I feel much safer now knowing that I don't have matches in my heating system.

Also, if you have an airconditioning unit installed in your bus, and what 
your really want is heat, check to see whether/how much the installation 
has crushed the big center duct. Mine was pinched quite a bit. Since I 
removed the AC parts long ago, it was simple to replace the crushed duct 
with a pristine duct from the junkyard.
