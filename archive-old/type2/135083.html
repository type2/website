&gt; Baja Bus has some pics and sizes for you to gander at... I have 15&quot; wheels 
&gt; sourced from eBay that fit Mercedes. I do not have them fitted yet. I'll 
&gt; have to bore the center bore out a bit to make them fit. They are BBS 
&gt; wheels.

You may find that these were meant for an Audi ( Merc, Audi, VW T2 etc all 
had the 5 x 112 stud pattern ), I've got a set of 15 x 6&quot; mags off an Audi 
A4 (http://neale_dot_org/images/a4rims.jpg) that fit the rear, but I've got to 
open the centre hole about 2mm to clear the front hub domes.

The 15 x 6&quot; mags I bought from the local VW specialist clear the hubs fine 
http://neale_dot_org/images/tiggers.jpg , and so do the 18 x 8.5&quot; mags 
http://neale_dot_org/images/antera.jpg I picked up 2nd hand for one of the 
&quot;projects&quot; ;^)

FWIW
