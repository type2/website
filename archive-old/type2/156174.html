Subject: Wiring Harness.

HI LIST.........first thank you all for being so
helpful. 
OK i have a 68 bus that i have put a 71 wiring harness
in ........its worked out good i mean i have found
places for everything but i am having a SHIT of a time
getting everthing to work. I removed this harness
myself from the 71 bus and i didnt take anything
apart.........But before removing it i had hopes of
restoring it and took it to a body shop for some
repairs and it sat out in the elements exposed for
over eight months. NOW everything that worked doesnt.
I can get one thing to work another quits....plus this
thing has so many splices in it it looks like its gone
through a shredder. What i was wondering if there was
anyone out there that might have a complete wiring
harness for a 70-71 bus that they would sell
me.....including the ignition and turnsignal wiring
(from the actual ignition and turnsignal controls) 
Thanks
Rus
