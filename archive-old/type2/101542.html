Subject: &quot;Save The Bays!&quot; at BBB-VII

	Hey all!

	Due to last minute mechanical issues (installing a Bus Boys steering
box on the '72, and buttoning up my 2260 T4), I wasn't able to post this any
earlier, but High Command here at &quot;STBs Central&quot; wishes to extend
encouragement to all West Coast and SoCal listees to attend BBB-VII at Lake
Havasu, AZ this coming weekend...

	The STBs entourage will be leaving from the North San Fernando
Valley fairly early Friday morning and travelling out the 14/138 around the
Mojave desert side of the San Gabriel mountains.  A breakfast break is
scheduled for The Pines Cafe on the 138 (Pearblossom Hwy in Little Rock a
little west of Four Corners) and ultimately picking up the I-15 at
Victorville.  From there we will be heading north on I-15 to Barstow and
then out I-40 to points east.  Mike Visket and myself will be on GMRS/FRS
Channel 2 for short range communications, all fellow travelers are
encouraged to use the &quot;little&quot; radios for short range group communications
(but leave off the sub-channels, m'kay?).  We are all packing different
brands of GMRS/FRS, and if you are using the sub-channels, communications
will be one-sided at best.  If George Lyle is travelling with us, he will no
doubt have some kind of double-secret, high-tech mega-serious radio gear and
will be able to contact bay pilots driving UFOs in from the orbit of the
moon...  George - feel free to chime in here on map routes, directions,
and/or radio specifics :-) 

	Just in case visual contact is made, I will be at the helm of my
taxicab yellow '72 Westy Weekender picking up the rear, Mike in his white
'69 poptop Westy &quot;Itch&quot;, George will (no doubt) be on point position in his
green/white '71 radio controlled Deluxe...

	See everyone there!  Stop by and visit us, pick up an STBs sticker,
and get ready to just have a fun weekend at Lake Havasu!
