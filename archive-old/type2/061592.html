Subject: Re: My Bus runs, but then dies after a f

&gt;Moving the switch from start to just
&gt;ignition relies on the contact in the
&gt;air sensor to keep pump running while
&gt;air flap is open (due to engine vacuum)
&gt;while engine is running, so I assume
&gt;it can't be the fuel pump contact as
&gt;was suggested.

Michael:

Sorry, but I don't follow your reasoning here.  If the AFM contact is
dysfunctional, the engine will run only as long as the fuel pressure
built up during the &quot;start&quot; cycle remains.  If the AFM fails to activate
the fuel pump, the engine will die when pressure drops low enough.
