Subject: Re: [T2] Pistons -- flat top or dish top


&gt;I called today to get prices on pistons and the shop person asked me if I
&gt;wanted flat-top or dish-top pistons.  I asked the difference, and she said
&gt;that the dish-top pistons are better suited to bus engines due to their
&gt;heavier weight, and the engine &quot;pings&quot; less when the engine is under stress
&gt;(like a hill).

More or less correct.  But if you're not a professional engine builder what 
you really should do is put in the type of pistons that were in your bus 
originally.  On my 2-liter engine, that means dished pistons.  On your '70, 
I'm not sure.

&gt;The drawback to the dish-top pistons is their lower
&gt;compression, and the fact that the engine wears quicker b/c the compression
&gt;starts lower on the dish-shaped pistons opposed to the flat-top pistons
&gt;(using compression as an indicator of engine heath).

Baloney.  The lower compression may or may not be a drawback depending on 
what you want from your engine, but it will not &quot;wear quicker&quot;.
