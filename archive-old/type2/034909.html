Subject: 76 FI system puzzle

Hello everybody...
 
  For a little while now i have been helping a friend with his 76 2 litre FI 
engine. We replaced his piston rings, cylinder heads, gaskets, pushrods, all 
seals, and a whole bunch of odds and ends. This was all no problem to me 
because I have a 79 that i have redone,  that is untill we find the 
differences in the 76 to 79 FI systems. The problem arises at the fact that 
he removed all of his FI stuff without marking what was what, where it came 
from (he also cut and spliced some mistry wires), so I (we) have no idea how 
it all goes back together. I know all the  primary stuff, but the few details 
are giving me a hard time.
      Untill now it has just been a puzzle. Trial and error will only get you 
so far with a fuel injected VW. I have the Muir (absolutely no help right 
now) and Haynes Manual, which is in his hands so i haven't had a chance to 
look it over. 
     What are my choices in reference to identify his system and figure this 
out? I know that i can get it straight, it's just a matter of time and 
patience (which is limited because it isn't my bus, and i wasnt there to 
disassemble and see how it goes together).  It's like filling out a Sunday 
Times crossword puzzle with no clues. 
      Any advice on schematical figures or anything would be greatly 
appreciated.
