Subject: Westy interior options and layouts -Reply

H. Steve,
My 75 as mentioned is a &quot;Deluxe&quot; because it came with the fridge. The
fridge would be great if I ever get it to work. The option mine lacks right
now is the roof linen cabinet which I think I might be obtaining from you. 
The table swivels in the middle for easy removal and is nice to set up
against the drivers side wall for stereo hook up when on city power.
Also the other cool thing is the small table that can be set up front for
two and can be removed and slid in between the sink and
stove/refridgerator for things to be washed etc.  Not that I'm bias but I like
this layout the best except that it lacks the swivel captains chair.  The
Yosemite Yellow w/blue green plaid, yellow canvas and orange tent
makes a very colorful and useful set up.  Wouldn't trade mine for
anything!

Love my bus
