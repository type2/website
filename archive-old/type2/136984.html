Subject: Falling dollar and bus parts

Ron (and others):

If the fall in the value of the dollar is long-term (and I don't know 
enough about international financial markets to speculate about this), 
does that provide incentives for domestic producers to start supplying 
aftermarket parts? Were they kept out by cheap Brazilian parts?
