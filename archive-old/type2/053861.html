Subject: It runs!

Ok, it doesn't run well, and after warming up for 30 seconds or so, idle
will slowly drop and it will stall, but at least it runs!  And now the oil
pressure sensor gives me meaningful values (after hooking it up backwards
first time).  I ended up putting the old pressure sensor in, since I wanted
the oil pressure gauge to work.  If I can believe it, I'm getting 60-80 PSI
at startup.  It hasn't run long enough to get warm yet, but we'll see.

Thanks to everyone who helped out.  Now it's off to buy a timing gun so I
can properly set the timing on this baby.

See you on the road,
Niall
