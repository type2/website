Subject: Wiring issues etc.

The post about about the flashers made me consider some issues I'm having.

1) My flashers work, this I am thankful for. But idjut lights are 'normal'
(or off) until the first time I use them, at which point both (regardless of
which way I'm turning) go on...and stay on until I shut down. Then when I
restart all is back to normal until I use the flashers again.

2) I read in the muir guide that the oil light should come on as soon as you
turn the ignition to on, then turn off upon start up. Mine doesn't turn on
at all. I checked the wiring, which seems okay, what now?

3) my horn seems dead. Can I use any horn for the time being? I know the
switch is &quot;negative based&quot; rather than positive, other than that can I go to
my local wreckers and grab any horn?

4) sounds silly, but I'm new to all this, built into my (driver) seat pillar
is a little black knob. This is connected to a little black cable, from
there...I'm lost.

Thanks for any tips, but please do not p-mail replies to the listed address
as it is my work address, and its not kosher.

Thank you,
Adam
