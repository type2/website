&gt;  The rubber parts had no part #s or any other identification on them.


Actually, virtually all of my '68 up rubber is either original-equipment
Volkwagen or imported European made aftermarket.  We source an odd seal here
or there from other suppliers, but that is by far the exception and not the
rule.  I am very proud to be the only US retailer selling mostly genuine VW
rubber for your bus.  (It hasn't been available from VW in the US for years,
for the most part; we get it right from Europe.)  Now, this still does not
mean that the rubber is neccessarily equal quality to what originally came
on your bus, unfortunately; even the genuine VW seals are typically
Brazilian made now and not neccessarily as nice as the old German ones were.
But if you compare them to what everybody else is selling (mostly
aftermarket Brazilian or Mexican) for more money, you'll find that mine are
head and shoulders above the rest.

As far as lack of labeling, there are two reasons. Much of the genuine VW
stuff comes in HUGE boxes - a box containing one windshield seal is easily
big enough to hold three!  I have no idea why they waste packaging like
that, but we certainly don't have the room to store them that way, nor is it
even economical to import them from Europe that way because I'd be paying to
import a containerload of empty space. So generally I have my supplier in
Europe break them out of their boxes and palletize them before shipping,
which allows me to import three times as many for the same shipping cost;
hence lower prices.  But I have seen these seals in the original boxes;
there is absolutely no doubt that they are genuine. The ones I sell that are
aftermarket European are sent to me in bundles of 25 with one tag on the
whole bundle, so when they get split up the tag only goes with one of the
seals. But again I am personally involved in the import of these seals and
can vouch for their source and quality.  I can definitively say that you
cannot get better seals anywhere else.

Of course in some cases I do offer several price alternatives; i.e. a
genuine VW rear hatch seal for $89 versus Mexican aftermarket for $39; or
German VW door seals for $199/pair versus Mexican VW for $39/pair.  There,
of course, the choice is yours, and as is usually the case you get what you
pay for when comparing the two.  (Although even the Mexican VW door seals at
$39/pair fit properly, which is less than can be said about the aftermarket
ones sold for $50 a pair elsewhere.)
