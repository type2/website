Subject: OOPs, sorry everyone!

OOPS!
I was just privately e-mailed that my water-cooled Vanagon questions were 
really not supposed to be on this list. Sorry, Since I have a 71 Crew Cab and 
I see others with Vanagons I naturally thought we were all on the same team! 
Can someone direct me to the W-C VW list?

Dave
