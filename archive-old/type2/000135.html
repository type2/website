&lt;&lt;As an aside, I used X-14 to do my poptop, and it worked magic!!  Now I
just have to get up the money to seal the fiberglass.  Has anyone ever
done this at home?  What did it take?  Would it be worth my while to
have a body shop do it?  I am a poor student (who has no more loan left,
after getting a $3000.00 car, DMV, etc) so any help on the cheap would
be great.&gt;&gt;

I'm not sure what you mean by sealing the fiberglass.  I checked with several 
fiberglass shops who recommended against putting a new gel coat over the old. 
 I ended up painting my top.

If your top truly looks good with no defects or cracks that need repair, you 
could try some type of clear coat.  This wasn't an option for me, as my top 
needed some small cracks repaired.

I did my top on the cheap.  I used a small foam roller and an oil based 
enamel, Rust-Oleum Outdoor Decor in Satin White.  I just carefully rolled on 
a couple of coats and it looks great.  With new Westfalia decals, I was asked 
by several people at a recent VW show, where I got the new top from.
