Subject: Is AC needed?

We took a 6 week trip around the country in Aug with a 9 yr old- Caframo
fans, parked it in the shade when possible (like next to an 18 wheeler
in a rest area), used an awning - with a counter-clockwise loop around
the country we were fine even in LA/LasVegas heat using fanned mister
bottlers. That is until after leaving Texas- then it was way too much
humidity as we went to Graceland.
We hit more motels on real sticky nights on that return trip.........
