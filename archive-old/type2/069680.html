Subject: Re: advice needed on state inspection

&gt;Here's where the advice is needed: anyone know if IN FACT holes in the
&gt;body will fail a vehicle for inspection?  This bus has 5 holes, all
&gt;the size of a lemon.  The inspection station says &quot;holes must be 
&gt;smaller
&gt;than a dime&quot;.  Anyone know if in fact this is true?  I don't believe it,
&gt;cause it's non structural rust completely!  They said bondo in these areas
&gt;along with paint would pass.... 

I don't know MD law specifically, but if MD inspectors are like those in
the great commonwealth of PA, cosmetic rust holes WILL flunk you. I know
of people that have passed with duct tape and spray paint, so bondo and
paint would work. Fiberglass is another alternative. As easy as bondo, and
I think the results are better.
