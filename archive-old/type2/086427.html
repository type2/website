Subject: sunroof drain routing

Like I said, any ideas how this system routes?

Are their drains at the rear like in the front at the sunroof?

Do the drains each exit the bus or do some of them manifold?

My passenger front is obvious, drains right out when I fill it.
Can't see the driver front drain.

Can tell much at the rear at all.

Thanks,

Billy
