	I'm a software engineer, I write driver code for mixed
signal (analog and digital) VLSI chip test systems. I got my 
first ride in a VW Bus some time in the 1960s, when my family
had a sunroof beetle and one of my dad's professors had an all-yellow
bus. Not sure the year. Can that have been a stock paint job? Maybe
it was white over yellow? Our family got a '68 new in '68. I actually 
drove it a little before it was sold in the 70s... I love the way
bay windows feel to drive :)
