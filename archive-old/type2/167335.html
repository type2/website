Subject: Re: [T2] HELP DIAGNOSE PROBLEM

Hi Laura,

Not sure what to say about the noises, and I blew an engine to pieces  
last weekend. But there is an engine noise page online at  
www.ratwell_dot_com, and it links to this sound of a loose connecting rod:
http://home.arcor_dot_de/silke.fokken/sounds/looserod.wav

(Jamie, is that the sound you heard my engine make??)

More engine sounds are found here:
http://home.arcor_dot_de/silke.fokken/sounds/

Dave (Busahaulic) makes some good points but I'd suggest you do a bit  
of homework before you drop the engine.

1. Check the oil. The 1979 engine has hydraulic lifters and 20W50 oil  
should be used. Low oil level can cause a lifter to leak down.
2. Do a valve adjustment, and make notes if any of the valves require  
a significant amount of extra adjustment. OK, hydraulics usually make  
this unnecessary, but I still think it's a good idea to check the  
rocker arms to see if one valve is out of line with the rest.
3. Do a compression test.  If there's one or more cylinders with less  
than 90psi compression, you have a problem.

If the valve geometry and compression numbers come back OK and you  
still have a noise, then it's in the block somewhere and the engine  
has to come out.

If the overheating was severe, the odds are that you might have BOTH  
a rod knock and a dropped valve. Do you know why it overheated?? Was  
there a problem with the fan, cooling seal or engine tin? Was the  
timing set correctly and the fuel injection functioning properly? Or  
was the engine simply run too hard for too long?  You need to remedy  
the cause of the overheating before you repair the damage it did,  
otherwise it'll happen all over again.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Anyone know the difference between throwing a valve guide  noise  
&gt; and say,
&gt; throwing a rod engine noise? Bus, 1979, overheated on a trip,   
&gt; engine turns over
&gt; with a loud noise which seems to be on the passenger  side. Thanks  
&gt; for any
&gt; help.
&gt; Laura :o)
