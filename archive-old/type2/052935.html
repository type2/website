Subject: Knock, knock...

No, it's not Friday and this is not a joke, but at least half of you are
reading this because you thought I was jumping the gun. Sorry, but all my
jokes come from 5 year-olds anyway. ;)

I'm hearing a low-toned knocking sound at low idle, only on initial
startup; not once the engine is warm. I'm thinking this may be rod knock.
I'm thinking maybe some bearings got hammered. Any thoughts/experience with
low-toned knocking sounds that only show up at cool idle?

Please note that I do have hydraulic lifters on this engine, and although I
have heard morning clatter from one of my lifters ever since I started
parking on a hill, this sounds different to me.

Any definitive tips on diagnosing rod-knock?

Ironically, there's not a rod-knock sound on the Engine sounds tape, so I
don't have one at volks_dot_net. Maybe I will now.

Thanks! Joe
