&gt; generator on a bus.   driving down the road would

This is indeed done, on airplanes!

Some airplanes do not have charging systems.  They have a magneto to
provide ignition spark directly, but nothing to charge a battery.  Since a
pilot usually needs to have a radio to communicate with airports, a
current source is needed.  The simplest solution was to make a small
generator and attach a propeller to the shaft and hang the whole works in
the slipstream.

Now, the problem with doing this on buses is that the speed range for
buses is much wider than that of airplanes.  Airplanes spend most of their
time at close to their cruising speed, whereas buses alternate between 0
and 60mph while in operation.  Choosing a propeller pitch that would
provide sufficient charging while not overspeeding the generator at high
speed would be difficult.

You're better off stealing a bit of power directly from the bus
generator!
