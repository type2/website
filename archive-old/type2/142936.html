Subject: Re: [T2] Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

&gt; So, Don, you can work on
&gt; your bus out here any time! It's only about 90 miles from you.


Thanks George.

It's this Highlands Ranch mentality here I think. They're mostly
California expatriates. In fact the Colorado locals call the whole
city &quot;Little California&quot;. Shoot, the developer of the city was the
Mission Viejo Company from Cali.

I should have known better than to move into this neighborhood. Sigh.
Can't wait until my lease is up...
