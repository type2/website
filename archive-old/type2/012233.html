X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

I am in the middle of
putting up a new bus site.
I am working on a electrical section and this
is what I have so far. Any comments positive or
negative (no pun intended) would be helpfull.
Anything you would like to see? If it is within
my capability to address I will work on it.

  Thanks!

My dog is usually pleased with what I do, 
because he is not infected with the concept of what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.
