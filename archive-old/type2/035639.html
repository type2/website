Subject: Help with bad oil burn

Hi all,

I need help with a bad oil burn that my 72 Bus seems to have picked up. I've
had her garaged for a year while doing the body work. Once I got her back on
the road I found that the engine seems to really burn oil. On a cold start a
thick blue smoke comes out of the back. If it runs for a long period of time
an oil leak can be found underneath the car, dripping slowly from the oil
sump.

When I took off the rocker cover on the left hand side oil just poured out
from the first arm cover closest to the fly wheel. The engine a stock 1600
upright with new heads. Also, and I don't know it it's related, but their
seems to be a leak of exhaust fumes into the cabin, from the vents
underneath the front windscreen.

I need to get this fixed so an advice on what to look for or how to go about
it would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

Roberto

72 Bus (Fritz)
