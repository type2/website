Subject: Re: Egr indicator

Ron,
The light is controlled by a box that is 'spliced' into the speedometer 
cable. It is located behind the kick panel in front of the driver. Just 
remove the one or so screws that hold the panel to the front wall, push in 
on the middle of the panel while at the same time with a broad flat knife 
lift the left hand end of the panel out of its channel. Near the floor 
you'll find the Rube Goldberg box that turns on the light ever so often. You 
can re-set it by pushing a botton on the box. It has no ability to sense 
whether anything is wrong with the egr system. Mine has an annoying rumble 
and I'm thinking of pulling it out, or removing the gears inside, if it will 
still serve to transmit the rotation along to the speedo. If not I guess 
I'll put in a new speedo cable, without the box .As far as I know, it is of 
no use if you check the egr on occasion anyway, which is required every two 
years here in California. The last time I checked, for my '75 the egr filter 
was running well over $150; I replaced it once when it rusted through, and 
the second one is still holding together. I thought the warning light was 
just to encourage us to check the egr system, not to replace the filter?
That is the story as far as I know it.
