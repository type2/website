&gt; Hi Doug,
&gt;
&gt; Put the van in 2nd or 4th gear. Follow the shift rod back about 600mm and
there you will find the join between the two parts of the shift rod. undo
the screw and disconnect the two halfs of the shift rod. The front section
is then easily removedd from the van to replace the bushing.&lt;&lt;

The problem I am having is the old bushing is on the shift rod down in the
guide pipe. I thought about disconnecting the &quot;rear&quot; shift rod from the
tranny, well since I have a 72 there is another joint on the rear shift rod,
this prevents disconnecting the rear shift rod and pulling it far enough
forward to take the bushing off.
