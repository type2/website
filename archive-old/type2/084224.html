Subject: How hot is too hot?

Hi Folks,

Just brought my 72 Westy (dual solex 1700) home from storage.  It is
great to get behind the wheel again.  It seems to me though that he was
running hot.  It was about 80 degrees outside and after having drove at
55 for about 45 minutes I could barely touch the rear bumper and had all
I could do to hold the dipstick to remove it to check the oil.

Any ideas?

Craig
