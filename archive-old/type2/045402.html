Hi Matt,

If it is getting close to leaving and you don't have a sale, drop me a line.
If I remember right from a previous post you are off to Germany/Europe???
I'm up in Sweden so if you ship the stuff with you we can maybe make a deal.
Let me know...

Regards,

Volks,

I have the overhead AC unit, compressor, condenser, evaporator for a type IV
bus. I will sell everything for $150 as I am leaving the country in two
weeks.
