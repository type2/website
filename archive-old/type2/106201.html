Subject: Re: [T2] removing nose section from parts bus

On Mon, 7 Apr 2003 ARoman4047_at_aol_dot_com wrote:

&gt; steering assembly, air ducting, doors, etc. You'd hafta remove all of
&gt; that before cutting off the nose. Afterwards (especially without the 
&gt; steering), I'd think the donor bus might be less than 'transportable'.

actually as long as the tie rods are still attached to the steering system
and front wheels the vehicle will still &quot;Trail&quot; if it is towed, you can
even remove the drag link.  

&gt; Unless, it's just gonna be winched unto a flatbed trailer...

that is in my opinion the best way to transport ANY bus at any time
