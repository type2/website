Re: [T2] heat exchangers

Where the heat exchanger sheet metal shroud connects to the engine cooling 
fan housing, there should be two miniature plates, each with two captive M6 
nuts, together with gaskets, to close off the gap.

To some extent, these two plates also serve to support the weight of the 
heat exchangers and exhaust silencer (i.e. muffler). I believe there is also 
supposed to be a support bracket on the left-hand side, fitted to the 
exhaust silencer to heat-exchanger flange studs and the fan housing. The 
alternator support/adjustment bracket, serves much the same purpose on the 
right-hand side.

If the exhaust system is only supported by the cylinder head exhaust port 
studs (and hopefully the alternator bracket - I've seen a few bodges where 
it didn't!), then both the cylinder head studs and the exhaust system, are 
prone to premature failure, owing to cyclic bending stresses and a 
phenomenon known as stress corrosion.

Standard exhaust system pattern parts, originating from any manufacturer, 
should be compatible with the original, factory fitted system, without any 
modification. Filing, heating and bending, etc., should be completely 
unnecessary. Any component which is pre-stressed by tension or bending, is 
susceptible to stress corrosion. For further worrying details, see my 
examination of this and other related topics, in the Technical Information 
Sheets, of the British VW Type 2 Owners' Club!

If one has to resort to these bodges, then the component is of 
&quot;unmerchantable quality&quot;, which is &quot;unfit for purpose&quot;, under the terms of 
British consumer protection law; irrespective of how cheap it was and you 
are entitled to return it to the supplier for a full refund!

The concertina hoses to connect the heat exchangers to the bodywork
ductwork, no longer use asbestos linings, but ribbed rubber instead.
Why not fit the after market in-line booster fans instead, as found
at Bluebird Customs, in Great Britain!

Regards.
