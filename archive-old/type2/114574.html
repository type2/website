Hey Chris... really sorry it didn't work out for you to keep the Westy. 
  Try to look at the bright side... not only will it bring joy to 
someone else, you now have the opportunity to start fresh with another 
Bus.

Best of luck to you in your new locale, and I'll make sure to drop you 
a line the next time I make it up to MSP.

Take care!
