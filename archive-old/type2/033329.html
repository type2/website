Aftermarket sway-bars (add one in the back and replace front one with a
beefier one) and gas shocks completely changed the handling prowess of my
'75 westy and I already had good reinforced tires. No more white knuckle
rides, no fear of gusty side wind.

Your idea implies a change in wheel offset. We had a lengthy discussion on
this topic a week or two ago. The quick summary is that too much difference
from stock will cause undue stress to the bearings among other things.
