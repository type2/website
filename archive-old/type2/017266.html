Subject: Brake Booster line

Well - yes a big vacuum line (w/ check valve) was in fact installed on
the left side of the air intake manifold just like everyone said. I
didn't pay any attention to it during engine removal/install because it
stayed in place, poking through the firewall.

Many warm thank you's for all the assistance.

Ron Johnson
