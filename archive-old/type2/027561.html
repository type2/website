Living in the midwest I have neever heard of required full service pumping. 
Why do they have this? It just sounds like one of those crazy old state 
laws.

&gt;Gentlepersons-
&gt;                        When I was immortal and rode a Bonneville (not
&gt;pontiac), it was always
&gt;easier to explain to the attendant that if he spilled any gas on the bike,
&gt;he'd clean it.
&gt;Usually resulted in the pump being handed to me. Since I live in NJ, I get 
&gt;my
&gt;gas at the
&gt;same place and don't have a problem with self service with my type 2, but
&gt;whenever
&gt;I do use another station the cleaning line seems to work...at minimum wage
&gt;those guys
&gt;don't want to do any more work than necessary.
