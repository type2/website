Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon seats in a 77?

The only &quot;Why not&quot; would be if you're really tall. Since the Vanagon
has a lower fender well where the seat is mounted, the seat itself is
about an inch taller. Not a big deal for most people, but  it could
be an issue for those who are really tall or like wearing fancy
hats. ;-)
I can validate Greg's comment here. I am 6'4&quot; and I recently put a Vanagon
seat in my '75 (driver's side only). It does raise it up a bit. But, to me the
added comfort is worth it, and I can slouch down a bit more in the Vanagon
seat than I could in the stock bay seat, compensating for the added height.
