Subject: More on my HEATER!

Just a quick note about my Stewart - Warner... 

IT DOES NOT LEAK EXHAUST INTO MY BUS!!! 

I spent over $3K on the interior and I would NEVER put up with gas 
fumes or exhaust in it! Not just because of posible damage to her 
Victorian tapestry - but for health and safety concerns as well! 

I don't use it for camping because she's NOT A CAMPER! When Mark and I 
camp, we pitch our North Face VE24 - 4 seasons tent. On solo raod 
trips, if I don't pitch the tent, I sleep on the floor in an expedition 
weight down bag rated to -20 degrees F. 

Mark fabricated a rigid exhaust pipe for it and it vents out the back, 
under the rear bumper. From the back Her Majesty looks like she has 
dual exhaust... (well... I guess she does - one from the engine and one 
from the heater!) Nonetheless - it vents out the back - but it's still 
gasoline exhaust and it's a PAIN to sit in one spot with it on for too 
long - it's kinda like sitting still with the engine running. Unless 
there's a strong wind, you just sit there in the exhaust.

When it's BUTT cold (like it is for 9 months, here) I turn it on and 
let it run for about 10 minutes while the engine in warming up and I 
NEVER have fumes in the bus - but to just sit there with it running for 
hours in a campsite would be HEINOUS! Then you would need a second 
battery. (Her Purpleness has a second battery and a West Marine Battery 
Combiner not for the heater but for the electronic cooler and the 110 
volt unit to run my computer printer)

:-)

I think if you want a heater that is just for camping that you should 
go for one of those units like Steve Johnson has - it might be that 
Propex kind - I don't know for sure - but he seems really happy with it.

Just let it be known that I wouldn't trade my GAS heater for a propane 
one because I don't want a propane tank anywhere inside or outside the 
BUS! If I ever get a camper... well that might be a different story. 
Until then I'll just crank the 20K Btu's through that puppy and be bare 
ass naked with no frost on my windshield!
