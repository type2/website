Subject: help..tranny problems...in santa cruz (digest mode)

hello volks,
i'm in scott's valley, ca and i'm having tranny
problems. i just had my automatic tranny rebuilt (all
but the throttle body) 3 weeks ago and i started
having problems 4 days ago.

problems...
large rattling (maybe flexplate?) when stopping or
when bus is tipped forward and in gear. i originally
thought maybe i had a rock stuck back there, but
checked and i could find nothing.

the flexplate, pump rod, torque converter and all
seals (inside tranny and outside) were just replaced
in arizona. the rattling started 4 days ago and now i
have a leak. the oil temp is at 180 when the drip (in
neutral and idling) begins. we are only a pint low, so
the leak just started, but the rattle has been in
place for 4 days.

earlier repair...new flexplate (one corner of previous
busted off.) rear main and front main seals.

i'm at a friend's house, but am in need of a
repair...and i don't want to wear out my welcome too
fast here.

any suggestions? i was going to try to call the old
volks home (soquel, ca) in the morning. if anyone has
some words of wisdom or words of encouragement, i
would really appreciate them. i am currently in the
8th month of my cross-country journey and i am far
from home (virginia.) locals or otherwise are welcome
to call...
(703) 786-9644 (cell phone)

thanks volks!
missy:)
