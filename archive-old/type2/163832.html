Subject: unknown idiot light in dash

I checked out the archives but not really sure what I am looking for.

I know its one of the idiot lights and I think its related to electricals.
its a light that is just to the right and below the speedo.  It comes
on with the battery light when I start, and ever since I had the
short, my battery light and this light stay on until I get rolling
along when they both go out.

I ask because I just returned from about a 200 mile trip and this
light came on as I was heading up and over the cascades via I-90.  I
had no loss in power (still did fine up-hill loaded down at 60-65).
When the light came on I started listening to the bus to see if she
would tell me anything was wrong.  No adverse noises,smells. or
otherwise and  I got about 5 miles from home and it went out.  So
while I am not too worried about it, I was hoping someone could tell
me what this light is for so I can take appropriate steps to make sure
everything is working fine.
