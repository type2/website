When pushrod tube comes to shove it...

After FLAPS, after going to VW Jedi Masters that always been there for me, 
after coast-to-coast dealer search, after coast-to-coast junk yard referrals, 
after the bus depot, the bus stop, and the bus boys; I come to the Web and 
those hooked up VW Brothers to help in this hardest of all such quests, the 
search for the allusive early 1700 pushrod tubes (AKA 021 109 335 A  w/ 
23,5mm outer diameter.)

I propose a contest for those of you willing to get out your trusty calipers 
and mics, those willing to climb that pile used parts, those who will covered 
&gt;from head to toe with old VW grease, to help get this poor bus back on the 
right road.  What prize that could proper for this quest reward I know not.  
All I could offer is my kingdom, humble as it is, to the champion that wins 
this contest.

Background:

1.  I only need one side (4)
2.  Early 1700 (first six to eight months) had smaller holes in head for 
pushrod tube
3.  The corresponding o-ring is still available w/23,5mm id (021 109 349 no 
letter)
4.  The pushrod tubes I need (021 109 335 A ) w/ the 23,5mm od in the outer 
o-ring land have been superseded to the 021 109 335 C w/ a 25mm od in the 
outer o-ring land which will not work with the early 1700 heads
5.  The o-ring needs to removed to measure correctly
6. Those with early 1700 w/ CB blocks of low production number may have ideas 
on measuring w/o disassembly by comparing  any other of the eight years of 
production, these early 1700 (low CB #'s) only had smaller diameter for the 
first six to eight months of production and they maybe actually '71 model 
year vans and buses with optional 1700 type 4 engine in place of the type 1 
dual-port bug motor (AB).  This info is from one of the oldest VW dealers in 
Houston.
7. I have only found one used bent pushrod tube with the 23,5mm measurement, 
but I know this unicorn exists

Thank y'all
