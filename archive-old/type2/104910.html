Subject: [T2] Remove my head


&gt; I have heard rumor that you can remove the heads from a T-4 engine with 
&gt; out removing the engine.   Can this be veified and or can someone point 
&gt; to or provide a procedure. 

Hoping for the easy fix ?
Passing on an unsubstantiated rumor :) ?
Who keeps perpetuating these rumors, anyway :) ?
Here's my vilification:) -
Remove cylinder heads without removing the engine ? 
Sure, but-
(And it's a really big but :) -You'll poke yer eye out !!!
You won't like it. You won't be a happy camper.
Bentley doesn't suggest it, either.
It is not recommended for the beginner.

Here's the procedure-You still have to remove every widget  
required to do this job whether the engine is installed or not.
Did'ja think the heads would just pop right off :) ?

Then again, once you've mastered -(and enjoyed )- the procedure,
you will  be able to use it for what it is. ( Fast :)
