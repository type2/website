Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Paint Jobs

It sounds beautiful!
The bus that I'm working on now is a rustbucket. I bought it cheap, as a
&quot;beater&quot; and &quot;schlepmobile&quot;, a hauler, daily driver or extra car. I never
intended to restore it. It's a '78, and the engine ran good, brakes were
just redone, transmission good.. that made it worth what I paid, and then
some, because I really bought it just for the engine and tranny for a
full-dress '79 Westy project that I want to do maybe next year. In the mean
time, I thought, &quot;Why not run around in this '78 and use it?&quot;
So, that's where it stands.. but it's butt-ugly, brown and orange splotched
with rust. I'd like it to look better, but I'm sure not about to strip it
all down and get a professional paint job. That would be a poor investment
at this point, because the sun roof panel is shot, rusted through. I've
toyed with a couple of ideas to make the bus more enjoyable for now.. One
would be (only if I keep it) to buy a pop-top tent for it. Another idea is
to use my new air brush and compressor to paint surfing scenes on it. I just
thought it would be fun and look pretty. And it will give me a chance to
really practice with that air brush.
I think that this would really drive the kids wild!.. Wouldn't THAT be fun!
