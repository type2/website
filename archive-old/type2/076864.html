Subject: Re: [T2] Blinker problems - '78 Riviera

I would look under dash for bad ground on switch.
Also try a brand new blinker relay, check fuses,(sometimes the simplest
things................:-0
If you hav a schematic and a test light you ought to be able to trace the
voltage to where you lose it.
Keep in mind that the power on the dash lights flow backwards, e.g. the
metel backing plate gets the juice and the bolb provides a route to ground
thus lighting up.
Good luck
Brian

Subject: [T2] Blinker problems - '78 Riviera


&gt; Okay as we approach the weekend I am planning a few jobs to our
(temporary)
&gt; Riviera - belongs to a good friend that says drive it and while you are at
&gt; it could you fix the blinkers and change the oil? Good deal for her, good
&gt; for us - nice to have a second car for a while. She may have trouble
&gt; getting it away from our 2 year old son and Lucy our Belton Blue English
&gt; Setter - both of whom have taken to this bus very strongly! &lt;Grin!&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think I can figure this out eventually but a few suggestions from you
&gt; guys could make it progress faster... Would allow time for the family and
I
&gt; to do something else.
&gt;
&gt; When I flip the signal lever on the column I get a steady dash indicator
&gt; for the blinkers (normal brightness). Outside I get nothing at either end
&gt; of the bus. They worked just fine until we replaced a voltage regulator
&gt; (which was simply just a plug in replacement).
&gt;
&gt; More symptoms...
&gt;
&gt; At night while the lights are on (interior, exterior, dash, whatever) they
&gt; pulsate slightly. This bus just recently got a new battery (would not hold
&gt; a charge) and regulator (because the battery was not getting charged
well).
&gt;
&gt; The signal indicator glows slightly at all times - more visible at night
of
&gt; course.
&gt;
&gt; No hazard blinkers when the switch is pulled to &quot;on&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; We did swap my own Westfalia's blinker relay for the Riviera and the
Rivera
&gt; still would not blink it's indicators. We could not test the Riviera relay
&gt; on the Westfalia b/c my Westfalia is still quite incomplete (no dash or
&gt; electrical services yet...
&gt;
&gt; Okay let's see if I can confirm the wiring diagram for this circuit
&gt; correctly verbally... (I have a picture too).
&gt;
&gt; 12 volts positive to the dash light (which terminates in a ground) and to
&gt; the blinker relay to the column switch which determines whether the 12
&gt; volts is passed to the left side or right. Then 12 volts passes through
the
&gt; column switch through the appropriate side's bulbs to ground.
&gt;
&gt; Is the 4-way flasher a by pass of the column selector switch to both left
&gt; and right sides and then through the bulbs to ground?
&gt;
&gt; So could it be that the fault in my system is that a main ground (possibly
&gt; at the rear taillight housings) has failed? Wouldn't the blinkers and
&gt; flashers still work on the front of the bus?
&gt;
&gt; I believe the front indicators ground right next to the housing on the
&gt; inside of the nose. Correct?
&gt;
&gt; Where do the rear blinkers ground at?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to all that can help.
