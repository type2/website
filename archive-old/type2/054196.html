Subject: VW Euro 2000 poster

In response to my offer of a VW Euro poster I got several requests with a
really good reason why the person needed one. So I'll be sending several of
them thingies all over the world. The story I'd like to share with you is
really good. It's a short story, just three lines say it all:

===================================================
We are starting a  new vw club in the appalachian mountains of  virginia.
All we have is one 181, one mule, three members and no funds.
We feel we are missing something and one of your posters would put us on the
fast track.
===================================================
