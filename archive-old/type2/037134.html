Subject: AridZona bus sale

  Hi, I bought this bus to fix up but the wife hates it (likes SAFE
vehicles, oh well).  &gt;
http://www.voiceconnection_dot_com/jeffk/TRANSPT1.JPG  So I want to sell it
right now...

Anyway, I got it running.  Has fuel injection and ac (no compressor).
Oil leaks when running near spin-on filter.  No smoke at
tailpipe when running.  Gets all four gears and brakes work.  Steers
straight.  Dent in pass front but door opens ok.  Interior is dirty
and rear panels are gone.  No floor mat.  Has front and rear seats.

Body has no rust of importance. Bike rack on back.   Looks pretty good
on the street.  It is brown with white top.  Factory orange
stripes.  Not a camper.  Emissions stuff need to be reconnected.  I
drove it over 55 mph, pretty peppy but noisey.  Not registered but
good title, not salvage.  Was AZ vehicle.  160K looks to be correct
milage.

I want $600 for it.  I live in Chandler, AZ near Dobson and Ray.    I
need 1966 Porsche 912 parts, so part trade for some of that would
work...

You could drive it home in the area.
