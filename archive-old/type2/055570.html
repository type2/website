Don't look for a consensus where *opinions* are involved.  IMHO, the 
best camper was the 1959-61 Westfalia SO-23.  Nice functional camper 
kit with exceptional craftsmanship - nice *wood* cabinets with brass 
trim.  The classiest interior made.

Generally the quality of craftsmanship of the Westfalia was higher 
than that of Sundial.

&gt;also, if all other things are about equal between the westy and the
&gt;sundial, do parts appear to be more plentiful for one than the other??????

The 1965-67 Westfalia SO-42 parts seem to be most plentiful.

&gt;anybody know which was the most produced model?

My guess would be the 1965-67 Westfalia SO-42.
