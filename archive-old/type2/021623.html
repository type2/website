Subject: Seats - Vanagon to Bay

The site always seems to be down when I need the library/archives.  ;-)

I'm looking at nice set of captain's chairs from an '83 (i think)
vanagon to go in my '72 Westy but I'm unsure about compatibility.  Could
someone tell me how easy/difficult it is going to be to install these
seats and what problems I'm likely to run into.  Will it require welding
them in or bolting them down?  I'm pretty sure they rotate, will they
still be able to rotate in the Bay with the partition behind the seats?
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
also - what would be a normal/decent price for these seats?

-Paul
