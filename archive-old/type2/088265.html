To the list:

I'm unsubscribing for a while as I relocate to a new assignment.  Just =
want to take a moment to thank the list for all the help.  I've received =
many tips and much good advice and help in the last 4 years.  I've =
already moved my bus to Northern VA, where I'll be moving and expect to =
get back on the list when I get settled in (looking forward to a visit =
to the Bus Depot and Metwiz).  In a 2100 mile journey with the bus on a =
trailer, I saw only 3 bay windows.  Did anybody see a giant Uhaul with a =
blue and white bus on a trailer with Montana plates about 2 weeks ago?  =
That was me. =20

A special thanks to the list administrators who make it all happen.  You =
folks are great!

Thanks,

Markus Bahnemann
