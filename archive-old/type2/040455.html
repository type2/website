It is time to thin the herd so I can concentrate on
restoring my 67 Westfalia.

I am selling my 75 Campmobile deluxe, I have it
advertised for $6000 OBO, this is very negotiable. 
Will consider split window trades. This van has
120,000 miles on the body w/20,000 on rebuilt. New &quot;D&quot;
rated tires. It will travel Xcountry. This has
everything the campmobile came with.  I have a spare
cpu unit, AFC and other stuff here is the url:

Parts for sale:

There are bay window parts and a nice front split
bumper.  Also not pictured I have a discolored but
uncracked split window window washer resevoir w/out
cap for $25 if anyone is interested.

Thanks,

Patrick Flynn
