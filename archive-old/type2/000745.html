Hey Volks,
As I pass the time waiting for my new longblock to arrive,(it was to be here
a week ago but was damaged in shipping so I am still waiting) I wonder what
I can look forward to when it arrives?  Obviously I want this engine to be
as leak free as possible. Anyone care to share their tricks/tips/mistakes? I
am really quite green, so even the really simple stuff would be of service.
It is a 76. 2.0 hydraulic, webber progressive(I know, I know but thats what
I got) stock vacuum dist...

I fear that I need a transmission soon as I sometimes pop out of first gear,
but finances don't allow that just yet.
I am under the impression(delusion?) that I can go a pretty fair distance
untill the tranny retires itself. I am planning a cross country journey this
summer, does this seem feasable? There were no howls or whines just the
occasional pop out in first....

As for summer plans, I plan to leave Florida on June23 , &gt; Boulder, CO on
June 27&gt; High Sierra Music Fest (Bear Valley, CA)July1-4 &gt; San Francisco/Bay
Area July 6-?&gt; Oregon Coast July?&gt; Cascades??&gt; Glacier National
Park,Montana....I might forgo some of the stuff after High Sierra  and do
the Southwest as a bunch of folks are doing that, but I am not a Desert fan,
so I don't know.... Anyone care to speak for New Mexico?

All comments apreciated!

Thanks,
Andy
