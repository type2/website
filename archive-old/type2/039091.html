&gt; As for the magnets, you can either find drain plugs which have a
&gt; magnetic tip, or find a ring shaped magnet which will circle around
&gt; the drain opening in the round steel plate on the bottom of the motor.  
&gt; This will attract and retain any filings which happen to make it to
&gt; the oil stream.

If you go for a magnetic drain plug, be sure that it is short enough so
that it doesn't interfere with the bottom of the oil strainer.  Most of
the plugs I've seen are too long for proper fit.

The ring magnet is a good idea, but if you start using it the engine
should never again be run without it.  The magnet will cause particles to
accumulate on the strainer plate, but the design of the drain plug does
not allow the bottom 1/8 inch or so of oil to drain.  If you leave the
magnet off, the accumulated particles will be sucked into the oil pump,
which is definitely not where you want them.
