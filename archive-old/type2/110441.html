Subject: engine out and apart,Hmmmm

Hi everybody,

       Well, I dropped the engine by myself (wasn't so bad). My bro' helped 
me hang it and I got it pretty apart. Looks like there's going to be NO quick 
fix here. Grabbing the flywheel and sharply shaking around I hear and feel a 
like &quot;clunk,clunk,clunk. So I'm going to have to take it all the way down. The 
heads still has the &quot;head gaskets&quot; in 'em.

Has anyone had any problem lately with leaving these out &amp; using the barrel 
shims?

The 1&amp;2 head had some leaking but, 3&amp;4 looked like a nuclear holocaust when 
on in there. Valves don't look to bad although lots of carbon.

I found on the case behind the flywheel what looks to me to be a crankshaft 
sensor.
Of course the PO had neatly cut the wire off.

Could someone tell me how this could be running w/o the wire connected?

The rear main was leaking pretty good. The front seal seams to be pretty good 
though.
What WAS leaking (good enough to drench the front of the engine, for years) 
was that whoever installed the oil filter mount decided it didn't need a 
gasket.

So for all of you trying to pin an oil leak around the oil cooler area. Don't 
forget the filter mount.
 More to come (I'm sure).
