Subject: Glisten PC Clearcoat

A not-so-good experience with Glisten PC,  a member of the POR 15 family.

I bought a set of new hub caps and painted them with Glisten PC using 
an ordinary brush. Temperature here in VA was 78 degrees.

First observation:  I had opened the can of stuff and activator once 
before. Some dripped into the kerf where the top seats.  For the 
smaller of the two cans, this was enough to seal the top so securely, 
that I had to wreck it with vice grips to open it.  This stuff is not 
cheap and I will get the use of only about half of the liquid I 
bought.

Second observation: the product did not flow all that well. I propped 
each cap on a brick that I stood end on. So gravity pulled the liquid 
from the VW insigna in the middle down to the rims. Some bubbles 
formed ; many lines formed where the liquid seemed to dry in the few 
minutes that elapsed between my swirling it on with the brush and the 
Glisten flowing down the hubcap.

Third, and the worst, observation:  I coated them about 10:00 that 
morning. I gave two coats as per the label. I left them outside on 
the patio that night hoping to give them a good chance to dry.  At 
the end of the day, the finish was certainly dry to the touch. That 
night, the humidity was very high. All windshields were covered with 
dew.  The mirror finish that was on the hupcaps the night before had 
changed to a very matte and very unattractive finish. Permanent.

Somewhere, I had read that interaction with moisture in the air 
actually improves the cure of the POR products.  If it did, than my 
result said more than that happened.

I'll probably trash the hub caps and buy a new set. I haven't decided 
whether or not to try again with the Glisten.

Just something to avoid if you use Glisten.
