Subject: Anyone interested in co-ownership?

Not necessarily a crazy thought... If you're like me, you wish you had
a nice old bug or ghia convertible, and maybe a 21 window sunroof
deluxe to boot. Unfortunately, that would be a pricey undertaking. It
will be a little while before I can save enough for even one such
model (in nice shape, of course) and in the meantime prices continue
to climb. 

So... I thought that maybe a few of us would be willing to get
together, pitch in, say, $1-2,000 and buy one or two old VWs to SHARE. 
I *know* that these things are not always easy to implement and that
they can be a source of conflict; rules of rotation, maintenance, etc.
would have to be worked out and agreed on beforehand, but I believe
it's feasible. Most listmembers I've had the chance to meet, I would
trust implicitly. 

Over a few years, if this works out, it might even be possible to
accumulate as many vehicles as there are members. I would like to make
clear that I don't view this as some sort of speculative profiteering
or investment scheme: the veedubs are there to be driven, enjoyed, and
*kept*. The intention is simply to be able to enjoy the vehicles
sooner than later and to beat their price inflation. 

So whaddya think? :)
