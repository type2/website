Hi, Scott--

That's the beauty of my plan--I keep my eye out for stickers that will let
my bus blend in no matter *where* it breaks down.  [Not that it would, of
course...!] I figure that the sight itself of a bus stopped by the side of
the road is enough to make a bus lover stop and take a friendly look; but
if there aren't any bus lovers handy, then a variety of stickers is Plan
B.  If it comes to that, I'll take help from lowered trucks and Civics,
too; I just need to inspire their better natures to stop and help. 

[By the way, I got my bus after my Honda CRX was stolen--twice.  And
you're right--I probably would have driven my Honda past a disabled bus. 
Wouldn't now.  Live and learn.]

Still Friday PST
