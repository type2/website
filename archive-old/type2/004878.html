Hey, everyone! I just bought my first bus - a beautiful '78 Westy, which the
owner didn't have the original manual to. My question is this: on the
dashboard, on the passenger side, is a green knob that's identical in size
to the headlight control knob. On the front is an imprint of a white curly
squiggle.  Anyone know what this is for?  My guess is a choke handle, but I
can't find anyone who knows for sure. Thanks!
