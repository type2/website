Subject: Re: [T2] Idling problems

&gt; My 78 f.i. westy suddenly and without warning developed an inability to idle
 at all.  Just put in Pertronix ignitor,  Bus stats well and runs well but
 will not idle.  This morning after about a 20 minute drive to work it came
 closer to holding an idle but not quite.  When started from cold (about 50
 degrees this morning) it dies instantly when the accelerator is lifted.  The
 air bypass idle speed control on the airbox has no effect.  Does anyone have
 any suggestions as to the first things to check. As I said this happened
 without warning after taking the bus to have new tires installed.  It went
 fine but on return would not idle.

Sounds like the common &quot;someone started it with their foot on the gas pedal and it blew a hose off&quot;!

But I am concerned about your remark: ' The air bypass idle speed control on the airbox has no effect.'
Are you referring to the screw on TOP of the air flow meter? If yes, that screw is not idle speed. It is idle
mixture. The idle speed screw is in the base of the throttle housing, below the throttle cable.
