Phillip,

&gt;I looked at the front of the luggage rack and there is about a 1/4 to
&gt;1/2 inch space between the actual roof of the bus and the seal that
&gt;wraps around the bottom to the pop-top.   I had the luggage rack off
&gt;last summer to clean it and put on the new seal.  Could I have possibly
&gt;put it on wrong?  Anyone ever experience this problem with new pop-top
&gt;seals?

I have this exact same problem - not only does the tent balloon, but it 
whistles pretty good on the freeway.  I managed to make it a little 
better by bending the brackets a little more, but I'm just not happy with 
that solution.  If anyone can answer this, I would be quite a happy 
camper.
