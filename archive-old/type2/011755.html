X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Alex,
  rubber mats can be had at West Coast Metrics.. last time
I checked. I took mine out and derusted everything.. primed
that step area then got some of that spray on tool handle
cover stuff... you can buy it in a dip can or in a spray
can. I didnt know if it would work but figured I could
clean it off if it wasnt any good. I have found this stuff
to be bullet proof to date... It is a rubberlike coating
and looks like a factory application. Just be sure the
surface has no grease or oil. Dont use it in a closed
garage unless you are in to that solvent based kind of
light headed thing... also it cures very quickly!... As to
the 3 holes... there are three rubber &quot;posts&quot; on the bottom
of the mat the fit through those holes. Thats all that
holds it in place.

[T2] Foot well mystery???

On my 1973 bus, when you open the door, there is this 
little &quot;step&quot;. On the passengers side there is a little
rubber 
mat covering it. On the drivers side it is just metal, 
without the little rubber mat. There are 3 holes there. Who

would sell the little mat?? How does it install??
