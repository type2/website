&gt; My friend, a long time 69 Volkswagen bug owner, sent me this e-mail of
&gt; advice.  Can anyone comment on this and state any possible objections?
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a grocery list of little things I have gathered over the years:
&gt; 
&gt; Get gas shocks.  You will notice the ride up front get a little bumpier, but
&gt; 
&gt; the handling overall will show a BIG improvement.  It will stop the 
&gt; sagging-ass thing that most busses suffer from, and will really tighten up 
&gt; the steering by cutting out the tendency to sway when changing lanes and
&gt; stuff

This might be true, but gas shock won't cure problems caused by worn
steering parts.  Unfortunately, people often install them in the hope that
they will heal the remainder of the bus

Gas shocks may prop up the rear end a bit, but again, don't expect
miracles.  Do a proper adjustment and you'll be much happier.

&gt; Bosch ignition parts are pricey, but the quality is well worth the money, 
&gt; especially the points.

Agreed.

&gt; Replace the fan belt once a year, and more often than that if necessary.  To

Once a year seems to be a good idea.  I buy a new belt, put it in the
spare parts box, and put the belt I bought the previous year on the
engine.  That way the spare is always fresh.

&gt; Don't store shit in the engine compartment.

Man, that would smell when you turned on the heat!  Actually, the only
stuff you don't want in the engine bay is lightweight stuff that can be
sucked into the fan.  I keep my oil drain pan and a couple of quarts of
oil in the engine bay without worries.

&gt; Forget about the stock VW jack unless
you want to crumple some &gt; quarter-panels. That baby is just for show.

Good advice for _bugs_, but the bus jack is much better.  In fact, I put a
bus jack in our bug to replace that slipping excuse for a jack.  The bus
jack is excellent if used for its intended purpose, which is lifting a
wheel far enough to replace the tire.  You should also carry a 6 inch
square piece of 3/4 plywood or somesuch in case you need to lift the bus
on a soft surface.

&gt; Increase in temperature= increase in octane requirement for motor to run 
&gt; without pinging

true

&gt; Decrease in atmospheric pressure= increase in octane requirement for motor 
&gt; to run without pinging

False; it's the other way around.  Lower atmospheric pressure means lower
effective compression pressure and lower octane requirement.

&gt; You will notice this the first time you take it into high mountains.  I
&gt; guess 
&gt; hell for VWs would be summer in a mile high desert with a gas station that 
&gt; only sells EC-1 regular 

My stock Mexican engine runs fine in those conditions, even in states
where regular is 85 octane.

&gt; heaven might be Valdez Alaska in winter, I dunno

Haven't tried that yet...

&gt; Actually VWs shine most in really cold weather.  They aren't desert cars
&gt; like 
&gt; everyone believes

Ask Rommel :)

&gt; Get a dwell/tach to set the idle.  Don't even bother trying to do it by ear 
&gt; unless it is an emergency- you'll always get it wrong

Agree.  Dwell meter makes adjusting the points easy, although the
adjustment isn't all that critical to running.

&gt; Plugs should be medium gray, not reddish brown.  Air-cooleds run around 
&gt; 280-360 degrees and incinerate the air/fuel mix.  The cooler temps of the 
&gt; water pumper may leave a reddish brown residue, but VW burns it hot and 
&gt; completely 

I've never been able to make sense of plug readings.  Seems as if
variations in fuel and driving conditions are big factors.  As long as
they aren't sooty black or stark white I'm happy.

&gt; Oil, Air and FUEL all act as coolants in air-cooled motors.  Make sure the 
&gt; mix is right (not too lean) or it will overheat.

True

&gt; There are certain speeds you will have to avoid.  for my car, they are
&gt; ~15mph 
&gt; (1st), ~30 (2nd), ~45 (3rd) and ~50 (4th).  Learn to work the gears and the 
&gt; powerband.  Those engines make good low end torque for their size, but you 
&gt; can't lug them or they'll overheat from too much load and too little cooling&gt; 
&gt; air.  You can't overrev them either, or engine life will be cut down because
&gt; of vibration (no harmonic balancers on these babies!) and you will gobble 
&gt; fuel needlessly.

If the cooling system is working properly, then there shouldn't be any
&quot;forbidden&quot; speeds.  If the system is deficient or if the engine is
modified, then this may be true.

VW engineered its engines to be usable in all operating modes likely to be
encounted by its customers.  An engine of low power output is expected to
be operated at or near full power for considerable periods of time, so it
must be designed to do so.

More powerful engines are not expected to operate at full power for long
periods of time so they can and do have limitations on how long you can
pull full power out of them.  This is one reason that you see so many
&quot;modern&quot; vehicles overheating when they are called upon to pull heavy
loads such as big travel trailers.  The engine can produce more heat than
their cooling systems can exhaust continuously, so the excess heat goes
into heating and boiling the liquid coolent. 

Our aircooled engines
draw upon a huge reservoir of fresh coolent (the atmosphere) so it's
unlikely that a properly-mantained stock VW engine will overheat.
