Subject: Re: [T2] frustrated still, what have I done now...??)_at_$#$]

&gt; you seem to be describing the CO adjustment prochedure...  haven't gotten
&gt; that far....   engine won't idle at all.  I moved the flapper itself to
&gt; get idle not an adjustment.   how did it get out of adjustment. passed my
&gt; last smog test with good numbers. so why would I need now to adjust CO
&gt; level before I get the engine running?????

Well, that whole system has a wiper that is screwed on to the flapper 
vane.  I'm not sure if it's possible, but the backfire might have moved 
the wiper in relation to the vane and is why you'd need readjustment. 
Just a guess, of course.

Did you check the resistance values to make sure that the AFM is in spec 
for your model year?

Mike
