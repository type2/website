Rotary
&gt; Engine these engines are incredibly small(overall) and extremely

and
&gt; go there were actually some turbocharged rotaries 165hp('87) and later
&gt; 182hp('89) and 200hp('90)

I know a guy who put a rotary into a sand rail. It was outrages and he
pulled it out after about two months. So it is posible, he used an
adapter, but I don't know who from. In a bus it would be a little more
drivable.
