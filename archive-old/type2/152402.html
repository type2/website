Subject: NC Thanksgiving Misgivings Camp Out (?)

Hi,

I though I was done camping for the year but Octoberbus got me all 
fired up to go camping some more. Thanksgiving Misgivings seems to be 
an option but where? Is there still one going on in Columbia, SC? I saw 
the posts about the Oconee SP, SC event and it looks really nice but I 
don't think I could take Friday off of work and that leave a 520 mile 
round trip drive to camp one night.

Jamie, Chad, and I were talking about it last night and thought  maybe 
we should put something together in our area. Is anybody in NC 
interested in getting something together? After a quick discussion we 
came up with a potentially good location: Van Hoy Family Farms 
Campground (former Octoberbus site) in
Harmony, NC just an hour or so from Greensboro, Winston-Salem, 
Charlotte and Boone.  The web site is

http://www.vanhoyfarms_dot_com/

In the past we have camped in the hollow behind the Coliseum (shed 
amphitheater) but there are no hook ups back there. We could camp in 
the area in front of the Coliseum that has hookups and use the wash 
facilities behind the stage.

The proposed date will be Saturday the 19th of November but we could 
camp Friday night as well if people are so inclined. If there is any 
interest in doing this let me or Jamie know. We can call the campground 
and find out about the cost and make arrangements.
