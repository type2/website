Yeah, but I didn't want my bus to look too fancy-schmancy with all those 
gauges and what-not (ah, the what-not...) on the dash.  Don't want to 
give some &lt;deleted in the interest of maintaining the list's high 
standards of decorum&gt; any temptation to break into my bus.

'Course, this is coming from a guy who built a top-of-the-line road 
racing bicycle a few years ago then took a can of day-glo orange spray 
paint, a can of flat silver spray paint and blasted the bike's gleaming 
paint with those puppies using no design in particular.  Got lots of good 
drips and runs happening, too.  Waited for the paint to dry, got out my 
trusty black felt pen, and where it previously had &quot;Pinarello&quot; (The frame 
builder's name) written on the frame, I wrote in big ugly block letters 
&quot;Not much fun in Stalingrad&quot;.  Bead-blasted the manufacturers name off 
all the components.  Bike looked ugly as... well, can't think of anything 
that ugly right now, but it's what was under the paint that counted, and 
it didn't get stolen.
 
So that's why I used duct tape, and how I manage to live with a duct-taped 
gauge in front of my face everytime I drive my bus.  Admittedly, my 
approach may not be for everybody...  :-)
