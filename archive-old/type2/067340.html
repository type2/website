 &gt;I am parting out several busses:

 &gt;'59, '63 single cabs
 &gt;'65 Kombi (2)
 &gt;'68, '73 Busses
 &gt;'63, '65, '70, '73 Westies. (very limited Westy only parts)
 &gt;
 &gt;All of the parts are original and guaranteed. Please E-mail if interested.
I need help to pay for the work on the restoration of my '64 T34 Ghia.
I also have many recycled parts for Ghias and Bugs, as well
Thanks,
Josh
