&gt; Interesting. If you select &quot;about us&quot; their address is obscured by the
picture they macked from thesamba_dot_com image gallery. Based on the area code
and the letter B I will guess Baltimore, MD. Bob(access systems) do you know
these guys?

Strange, when I went to the 'About us' page, the last line says &quot;We are in
beautiful Boulder, Colorado&quot;

Never saw the site/heard of them before today...
