Subject: Re: [T2] louvered window interior trim moulding

Hi Paul,

That interior trim for around the jalousie window is INCREDIBLY 
difficult to find. I have only every seen one bus that had it, it was a 
68 that came to Ontario from California. Something is tickling my 
memory that I might have seen a comment in the last week or two that 
this is a 68-only part, but I'm not sure.

FWIW, it's a real PITA to install, and it comes loose quite easily.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Any ideas of where to find one new or used?
