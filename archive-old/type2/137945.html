So does this mean the master mixture adjusting screw ties into the
fuel circuit inside the carb? If so, that would mean the master
mixture adjustment only adjusts one carb. I can't find a schematic of
the internal carb fuel circuits, but I thought it only served to allow
air into the crossover air tubes, which would affect mixture at all
RPM's, though it might be an insignificant amount of air bled into the
manifolds at speeds above idle.

In any case, Don should test the mixture at altitude and not assume
the motor is safe just because it runs good. Although I see VW does
specify only one jet size for the model with no reference to altitude.

Don, the Bentley does describe a method to adjust the idle mixture if
you do not have a gas analyzer.
