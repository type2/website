haven't got the directions any better either I see.

basically you disconect the linkage between the carbs
adjust one to the mark, then adjust the other carb.
then adjust the connecting linkages to match the carbs

when it doesn't work you start over

I generally found I could tune by ear better than that thing and I used to
use a timing light on my 1300!!!


now remember I have not had anything with a carb since I got rid of my 71
van in the late 70's so I could be forgetting a step,  Have no clue if the
