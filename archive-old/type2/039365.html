Subject: More Q's on the '69 carb/coil issue;-)

Hey All,

Well, I just knew my problems with 30/31 Brosol carb
('69 Westy/1600sp) weren't over;-) I bent the tab on
the float and it made the float valve kill the flow
with the key off...for about 24 hours. It's back
again, but not as bad. I picked up yet another rebuild
kit (this makes four times in 2 years), and I'll
probably rebuild the damned thing in the next week.

Also, I pulled my Bosch Blue coil (leaking like a
seive) and put in my backup coil...a 30+ year old
Bosch Black coil. It's pretty weak, but I didn't want
to get stranded. I'm still debating which direction to
go for a replacement...

Here's the potentially great news...while at the parts
store, I saw a note on the bulletin board for a
&quot;Weber-progressive carbureator and Scat
manifold/air-filter for VW...$50.00&quot; I called, and the
lady said she didn't know anything about it, but that
it was off of her '70 bus. HMMMMM!!! I'm hoping it's
the proper size and in good shape....I'll be looking
at it in the next few days. Any idea what a Scat
manifold is???? I know who Scat is, but are these
manifolds any good???

Only problem with the Weber (that I know of), is that
I have sp heads, and the only Weber manifolds I've
seen are all dp.

So....here's the dilemma...I do not know the history
of this motor, other than the 2 years I've owned it.
It runs strong, has decent compression (115-120 all
around) and has been trouble free for me. Should I get
some dp heads to utilize this carb??? Is it risky
adding this setup to a motor of undetermined age,
etc.? Or, should I just rebuild my POS 30/31 yet
again, and save the Weber for a future motor
rebuild??? 


Thanks for the help!
