Defintiely not too hot. It was hot after installing, but I have a VDO temp 
gauge, tested ok, I have only run in city last 6 months, temps stay below 
220. Heat tab ok. I had an engine go last summer (the one that came with the 
car ) had a reubilt put-in which always ran hot then it blew up - I'm pretty 
sensitive about the hot engine thing and keep a close eye on it...

&gt; &gt;If it's an SIR engine you proly have one of those little round heat tabs
&gt; &gt;right under the dizzy with a small piece in the center that is supposed 
&gt;to
&gt; &gt;melt at 255 degrees.  Has that piece melted? If it has you have obviously
&gt; &gt;(as Jake said) gotten it hot.  I would do a compression test on it , and
&gt; &gt;then proceed from there.
