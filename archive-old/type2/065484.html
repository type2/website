I just want to know if I am alone in my situation. In the region of 
Quebec and there is a club for westfalia. I make a demand to join the 
club. But I can't because my westie doesn't have a pop-top. But it's a 
real camper, every thing inside is original and I have the stickers
westfalia.

very peculiar.   Perhaps they don't know that Westfalia made campers with out
pop tops?   Actually, most of the split screen Westys were without pop tops.
In any case, I prefer clubs that don't have snooty rules about who can join.
