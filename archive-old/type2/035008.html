Subject: Re: ISO Turn Signal Switch

Jack:

The 1974 Bus used two different turn signal switches during that year.

Early 1974  211-953-509H  $79.25
Late  1974  211-953-513K  $55.00

Both are in stock.  The best way to get the correct one for your Bus is to
get the part number of of your old switch or to write down your chassis
number.

Thank You!

&quot;Customer service is not a department,
it's an attitude&quot;

&gt; I am in desperate need of a turn signal switch for my 74 westy.  It is
&gt; the ONLY THING that is preventing me from driving my new bus, (I want to
&gt; be as legal as possible before I head out into the real world.)
