Subject: Re: [T2] re:Propane Tank

HI Mike,
	Two completely different sorts of tank.  The acetylene is stored
as a compressed gas in a solution of acetone contained in a porous mass of
&quot;aga&quot;. So, much of the container is taken up by the aga and you don't want
any of the acetone to go away as you draw off the acetylene. Acetylene
tanks come with flow ratings, not to be exceeded by the sensible. Propane
is stored as a liquefied gas under presure of the vapor boiling off the
top (temperature dependent pressure) in an 'open&quot; tank i.e. no porous
media needed. We use propane in &quot;domestic appliances&quot; at about 0.5 psi but
can use it at higher pressures as needed, whereas we should use acetylene
somewhere under 15psi (at which pressure it spontaneously explodes; given
a few variables, temperature, a little shock, etc)

Propane tanks suitable for bus use are not outrageous when one thinks of
the potential bad experiences on failure.  They have to survive for years
under the bus, ignored, beat upon by stones, salt and mud, overheated by
sun-baked black parking lot surfaces, chilled in the frozen north.  
	
As I recall the potential price on the safety-certified double-size tanks
was in the vicinity of $200.
