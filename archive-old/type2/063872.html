Subject: Wood int. panels

Hi everybody.
I don't get a chance to converse on the list and I don't have time to read
all but about half of the mail, so I thought about jumping in with this
little bit. My '71 Westy will be done at the body shop in a couple of weeks
and I'm looking foward to putting her back together.  A local mill is going
to order the 5x5x.125 panels for me, and I wanted to know if there was
anybody on the east coast that is needing some. The cheapest I've found
localy is $24.50 a sheet.(not as lucky as the westcoasters-8.90 a
sheet-ouch!)  Anybody that has a cheaper source without the shipping
hassle(local trucking company tried to screw me once) let me know. I'm in NC
near Charlotte. Let me know if anyone needs some, I'll ad it to my order.

Any info on the following would be appreciated.
I found a strange engine at the flee market. Its similiar in design to the
VW engine,came out of Army surplus(painted green) and has Colt Ind. on the
tag thats bolted to it. It has a keyd shaft coming out of the flywheel were
the glandnut would be. A friend asked if it could be used on a welder setup.
They ask $1000 for it which seemed high to me.

Also I know that a few people have asked, so add me to the list. I'm still
looking for a set of Vanagon alloys or any alloys that will fit my Westy. As
a last ditch I'll chrome my steel wheel, but its a long time for my van to
be up on stands waiting for them to be plated.


bye for now.
