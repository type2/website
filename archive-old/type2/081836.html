Subject: Re: 1981 Westfalia FS (seat belts)

Hello folks,

I guess there is more to the story - apparently the seat belt were
removed(?), though I've never seen the attachment points - I didn't know
they had seat belts way back in 1981 (just kidding, I'm not that young!).

1.  we are first-time-parent-overly-cautios and plan to haul the little one
around in our cam*y until they're restless in the car seat for long trips
(and not sleeping all the time) - then we'll get a westy type camper with AC
(south TX is hot also and we're wusses, the 81 has aftermarket AC but it
don't work)

2.  we only drive the '81 on weekend and vacation trips, of which we haven't
had since we started construction of the house addition - we got an 83 chevy
pickup to haul materials (didn't want to tear up the camper)

3.  we need the money!

thanks for all ya'lls concern
Christopher Darilek
