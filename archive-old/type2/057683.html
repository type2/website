Subject: 1954 Camper FS!?!?!

     Well, the add I found reads:

     1954 Volkswagen Van, all original, runs good, $1500, 205-491-9670, 
Bessemer, AL

     I called the guy and gleaned the following information:

     &quot;There's very little rust, just a few holes in the floor near the 
side doors&quot;

     &quot;It really is a 59.  They didn't make them till 58&quot;  (I'm quoting 
here)
     
     &quot;It is blue&quot;

     &quot;It is a camper, but most of the camping interior has been ripped 
out&quot;


     Someone from Fla. may or may not be on the way to get it.  It still 
has the jalousie windows, and the original engine.  It allegedly has no 
dents.  It's first owner allegedly died.  His wife then sold it to a 
friend who has a pawn shop.  The current owner bought it from the pawn 
shop.

     Sadly I can't justify calling in my flatbed favor on this one, so 
I'm passing it on to the list.  I'm not currently subscribed to 
vintagebus, so could someone forward it over there.

     Good luck. If you get it, let me know!!
