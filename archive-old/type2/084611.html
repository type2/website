&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions for removing old stickers from painted

WD-40.  Wipe repeatedly with light pressure.  FINALLY a legitimate reason 
for me to keep a can of the stuff in the garage - first time I have found 
something that WD-40 works BEST for.  Lubricant?  Only in 
emergencies.  Solvent?  Only in emergencies.  Sticker remover?  WD-40!

DISCLAIMER - I have tried it on glass and some types of paint with good 
success, but never on automotive paint.  I think it will be okay, but I 
can't say for sure since I've never actually tried it on automotive 
paint.  Maybe someone else on the list has?
