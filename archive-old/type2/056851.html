Subject: Alternative List Addresses...

It looks as if the mail at type2_dot_com is broken. I don't know when it will
be fixed.

But the lists should still work if you use the &quot;real&quot; addresses, which
usually stay hidden:

	type2_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com

	vintagebus_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com

as appropriate. This should route around the problem server. Thanks for
your patience.
