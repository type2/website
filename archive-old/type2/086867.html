&gt; &gt; &gt;  I finally got ahold of a fuel pressure tester today, but of course
&gt; &gt; &gt; since nothing is ever simple in my life, the gauge has a threaded
&gt; &gt; &gt; fitting
&gt; &gt; &gt; at the end thus it wouldn't hook up to to the terminal on the ring
&gt; &gt; &gt;main.  Not deterred and after seriously considering cutting 
&gt; &gt; off the end
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Shouldn't the fuel pressure gauge (brand new) read at 
&gt; &gt; least something
&gt; &gt; in the 30-34 psi range
&gt; 
&gt; I figured it would read at least a couple of PSI since fuel is coming out...

one would think so, however no fuel can escape while testing since it
would not be able to produce presure (you knew that)

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; was gonna answer more of your questions but got tired of manually
&gt; &gt; formatting your original message, turn on your word wrap and set it at
&gt; &gt; about 74 or so then repost and I'll answer the rest of your 
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry.  We've been forced to switch to Outlook at work (no way to set
&gt; word-wrap for some reason.)  The post was sent from home using the
&gt; Outlook Web Access, also no settings for word wrap, I'll repost later

there is a way to do it in OE, trying to remember how I was told.  will
look it up if I can but it can be done, just well hidden
