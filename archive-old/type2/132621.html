Subject: Re: [T2] PARTS IN ONTARIO CANADA

Hi Darren,

Used parts places?? In Ontario??  ROFL.

There are swap meets associated with local VW events, but other than 
that it comes down to who you know and what they have at the moment. 
The local wrecking yards near Toronto have NOTHING Aircooled....

We had a pretty good swap meet going at Buses Of The Corn last month, 
but I think the swap season is just about over now.

www.germansupply_dot_com can help with new parts.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;
&gt; I have a friend in Toronto who is in need for some parts.
&gt; Does anyone know of any used parts places or even
&gt; new parts places to help him out?
