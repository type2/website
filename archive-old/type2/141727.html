Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding door not shutting properly

Ray

Had similar problem with mine.  When I shut the door, it would scrap  
paint off the panel edge.  I haven't replaced it yet, but the nylon  
bush that sits behind the sliding 'hinge' is apparently the culprit.   
I have one now &amp; will replace it before it gets painted this weekend.

&gt; Mine won't close easily. I have to hold the rear
&gt; of the door so that it is away from the rear
&gt; sheet metal. If I try to close it normally, the
&gt; rear of the door collapses into the body.
