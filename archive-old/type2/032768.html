&gt; Subject: 7 or 9seater owners - what's in the back?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Have been looking for the covering that goes over the engine bay in
68-72
&gt; &gt; busses... some folks have said a rubber mat, some have said a piece of
&gt; &gt; plywood. Anyone have one or the other that they KNOW is original?
&gt; &gt; I have a 70 DELUXE, so that might make a difference..........

 In the 73 NON walk-thru I found at the wrecking yard....it had a rubber
 backed dark charcoal grey mat. Factory piece. This bus also does NOT have
 the spare tire well in the left rear corner. The spare went up front behind
 the 2/3 seat.
