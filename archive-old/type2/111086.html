Subject: new fuel sender woes

I have put in a new fuel sender and it has not worked.

Well, I cut the hole in the floor of my '75 panel van
with upright 1600 in it. Australian model.

I got the old sender out and put in  a new VDO one for
a '73 -'80  211 919 051a. 

I tested it with my multimeter on the 2000k setting it
read 009-075 (empty to full) 

New earth lead as the old one was earthed up under the
bulkhead and was loose on the screw. 

New connector on the signal lead. 

If I earth the signal lead against the body at the
tank end the guage heads to full pretty swiftly so I
am thinking the guage is ok. 

Its got me stuffed. Im thinking the new sender may be
dodgy but am not too sure how to further test it. It
seems to increase resistance as it gets to empty on
the multimeter. 

Im wondering if the '75 1600 has an early sender
(maybe like a '75 badged '71)????? 

The fuel guage worked up until a few months ago.

Do early (pre 73) senders look the same as later ones?

Any musings welcome.
