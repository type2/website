&gt;BTDT... Problem with picking up the relay trigger from the coil is that
&gt;as soon as you turn the key the batteries are tied together.  If both
&gt;batteries have a charge, this works fine.  However, if the aux battery
&gt;is absolutely flat, you won't be able to start your bus.  The flat
&gt;battery sucks the charge out of your starting battery.

I've done a lot of experimentation with this in the past.  A completely 
flat aux battery when connected to a charged starting battery will draw a 
couple hundred amps instantaneously, with the current falling off quickly 
and geometrically to insignificant levels within a few seconds.  A standard 
starting battery in good condition can supply 500 amps for a couple of 
minutes and will not be significantly depleted by the dead aux battery when 
tied together for a few seconds.

I still run mine triggered from the coil and I've not had any starting 
problems even with flat aux batteries.  It depends on lots of things, like 
how large your starting battery is relative to your aux battery, what the 
condition of your starting battery is in (this is the most important 
thing!), the gauge of wire interconnecting them, whether you leave the key 
in the &quot;on&quot; position very long before starting, and how long it takes your 
engine to start once it starts cranking.  But in general, I've found it to 
not be a problem.

You can even look at this from a conservation of energy standpoint.  If 
there is enough energy in your starting battery to start your car, then 
hooking it to another dead battery and allowing them to equalize should 
still provide the power to start your car since no power has been added or 
subtracted from the system (except for a small amount to heat the 
connecting cable during the power transfer and chemical-electrical 
conversion losses to heat).
