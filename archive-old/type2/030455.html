Howard,

Those panels were for reinforcment when major structural mods were made.
They *are* factory installed, but are *not* on all buses.  I am not
especially knowledable about which do and which do not, but I would not
let their non-presence worry me, unless you actually see chisel marks
where someone removed them or if they are in rusty tatters.  What follows
is a *very* crude guess at a list of which bodies had these panels.  I am
hoping that I will get enough corrections and additions to make a
definitive list possible.  (this is a subject I have been curious about
for a while :-)

Have reinforcement panels covering frame outriggers:

Westfalia Campers, '68-72
Single and double cab trucks

Do not have reinforcement panels covering frame outriggers:

7-Passenger buses '68-79
Westfalia Campers, 1973 (I know mine does not)

Unknown:

9-passenger buses
Westfalia Campers '74-79
Panel Vans
