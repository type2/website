Well I had really great advise on this and I'm going to relay it.
Take #1 plug out, insert a piece of wire like mabey a straight piece of
coat hanger through the hole, roll the car foreward in gear until the
piston gets all the way up enough to touch the wire (it should squeeze
the wire a little) check that your rotor arm is pointing in the general
direction of #1 spark plug wire in the cap, stop. Mark your fan shroud
and fan with a temporary marker. Leave the wire in the cylinder and move
the vehicle in reverse, in gear until the piston again touches the wire,
mark this spot temporarily. The spot in the middle is Exact TDC, mark it
permanently.

Da! Da! Thats all folks!

&gt; This gets you +/- about 10 degrees or so.  To find the real TDC, you
