Subject: Rare find

http://williamwareagency_dot_com/forsale/stanvan/coin.htm

While holding field day on my Westy I found this coin that I've had for
ten years. It is a Pearl Harbor Commemorative coin that was minted in
Queensland and has a face value plus a value to collectors.
The going is Gold and had never been out of the protective plastic box
until I used tweezers to put it on my scanner, I'd say it is in
absolutely perfect condition.
I intended to put the coin in a shadow box display frame for my office
but retired before I got it mounted.
If you have any interest in this coin please Pmail me for other details.
