&gt; 1) Along with the taco plate and cover there are gaskets.  What

&gt; they to be installed in the motor?  Picture or drawing would be great.

The big red o-ring goes between the plate and the engine case. The  
ring paper gasket goes between the plate and it's cover but you'll  
find it's not really necessary.

&gt; 2) Which way should the sender be pointed?  It looks like I have a  
&gt; 50-50
&gt; change of getting it right

Rearward.

&gt; 3) The taco plate I got came with an old temp sender in place.   
&gt; Does anyone
&gt; know if this will work (&amp; give correct readings) with the VDO gauge  
&gt; sold on
&gt; Bus Depot site?  Yes, I know you probably want the sender part  
&gt; number - I'll
&gt; get that soon.

They are often the longer style 400F senders from 914s. They don't  
work with the standard VDO gauges expecting a 300F sender. A new  
sender doesn't cost much.
