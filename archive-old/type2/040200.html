Subject: Body off restoration

Some of you may remember me writing about someone in Holland who is doing a
complete 'body off' resto of a split window bus. Since the basic build-up of
a bay is not too different of that of a split the pictures of this resto are
giving some insights you would never otherwise get.

I have recently added two more pages (bodywork 1 and 2) so you may want to
come back and have a look.

Goto to http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus and click on &quot;T1 restoration&quot; (under
the heading &quot;Technical&quot;) to get the full story.

Since I don't own any splits myself I'm not on the vintagelist. maybe
someone could cross post this message there. Might be of interest to these
guys (and gals) as well.
