&gt; Just wanted to say that the new digest format - as of 29 March - is
&gt; wonderful from here.   Much better than previous.  THANKS.
&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I totally disagree. It requires a lot of mouse clicking to read all the
&gt; attachments.  Also, I think that back in January the consesus was that most
&gt; people preferred the single message format.
&gt; 
&gt; Was this change deliberate or a side effect of the transitions the server is
&gt; going through?

Well, it's like this...  the default format is for separate attachments,
like it is now.  It can be set for all-in-one, like it used to be, but I
forget how.  (Ken:  Could you remind me please? :-)

The change in format is part of the whole moving the list thing that will
be happening over the next week or two, as I announced yesterday.  At the
end of the process, I will reset the digest to be all-in-one.  There are
two reasons for having it this way.  first, a slight majority of our list
memebers responded with that preference back when we last moved, and
second we've always done it that way.  *BUT*  because we will be moving
twice in the next two weeks, and it is a bit of a PITA to reset, I am
going to leave it in the default setting until we get set up on the box in
Seattle.  Is that OK?  tolerable?  If there is anyone who *cannot* read
the digest in the current format, let me know.
