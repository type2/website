Hey Volks,
I just got my Bus from the painter, and she looks Green, I mean Great...
A little history, I bought 'the Avacado' (1976 westy)in Feb. from someone
who appeared to have taken care of the mechanical end of things, allowing
the body to deteriorate a bit.The engine (2.0 weber carb, FI was thrown out
by the ppo) was clean enough to eat from.Rust in the usual places, battery
tray, window sills, front windshield sill, cargo floor and rear quarter
panels. All of the rust(and some bondo too) was cut away and new sheet metal
was welded in. Before I made an offer to buy, I had reputable VW mechanic
check the usual suspects. I know that he did a compresion test(though I
don't know what the readings were) and a few other things, like put her on a
lift and check the undercarriage for structural rust damage etc... He gave
me the green light to make an offer with the comment, &quot;the engine is strong
and runs well....The Mixture is a little rich though&quot;. With that in mind I
bought her, and started the above mentioned rustoration. Now that I have her
back, I have been putting the westy interior back together, new poptop seals
and that kind of stuff.

Well, now I am running around town and checking my oil every time I stop and
noticed that my oil smells gassy, real gassy. There is an &quot;amgauge solid
state electronic&quot; fuel pump installed. A local list member suggested that
the fuel pump could be the real culprit. When starting, the key is first
turned on, then a starter switch. while the key is on, but before the
starter switch, a distinct clicking can be heard. Could this be the fuel
pump pouring gas into the carb? Could this account for my oil smelling like
gas? Gasin the oil is BAD, right? It must be cause it thins it out , right?
What are the common problems associated with a 2.0 FI converted to a single
Weber Carb? To me the bus runs great, starts immediately, has good response
and warms up quickly. I intend to adjust my valves tommorow, (for the first
time) and do the Muir tuneup procedure. Any help or comments would be
greatly appreciated.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot, there are no hoses attached to the heater
blower(attached to the top of engine compartment) I assume these hoses go
out the bottom of the tin on either side of the engine. Hoover said that
these should be hooked up as they help keep the engine cool? Should I search
these hoses out or can I get away with fabricating tin to cover these holes?
Also I already fabbed tin to go where I assume the A/C compresser was ripped
out(drivers side rear) but there is a two inch gap left uncovered where the
metal is real mangled. Is that acceptable? Also I noticed a gap where the
alternator adjustment bracket is. Is that ok? Should I do a duct tape thingy
there or what? I live in Florida and it is hot here. I want the coolest
running engine possible. Any and all comments welcomed.

One more thing, I noticed an add for one of those electronic ignitions that
said using one would lower oprating temps by 10 degrees or something like
that, I think it was pertronix(could've been  jacobs or msd) any opinions?

Thanks,
Andy2
