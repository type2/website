Thanks to those supplying me the information I wanted to know about my
future desire to lower my 79 VW Bus.  No one ever really replied with any
custom wheel information and I will continue to look. As I stated before I
have been working 14 months on this Loaf to bring life back in it. As of
lately I now drive it with pride every chance I get. I live in a state that
requires emission controls for this year model.  The engine that I got when
time can for that installation was a 77 Fuel Injected 2.0 with no emissions,
thus I have had to get those parts. The only thing that I lack now is the
oxygen sensor.  However I now lack the technical information as to where the
wire terminates from the oxygen sensor to the computer.  I have visited
several internet sites were they offer electrical schematics, but I have
never seen any real good detail information.  Does anyone have that
information or knows where I can get it..

For the Group:  After reading about looking for parts, during my rebuilding
of my 79, I too looked high and low for many parts, big and small that were
either missing or broken on my Loaf. I would like to offer Russ's Recycling,
756 Alpha St Duarte, CA 91706 91010 Telephone: 626-303-4366.  Another is
Discount Import Parts, 15100 SE McLaughin Blvd, Milwaukie, Oregon 97267,
(503)-659-7444 and ask for Dan.
