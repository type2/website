&gt; Does anybody know if there is a book or video on the subject of rebuilding
&gt; type 2 trannies??  I'm considering rebuilding my tranny, but the info in the
&gt; Haynes and Muir books is sketchy at best.  Has anyone out there done this, and
&gt; how did it go??

The info in the Muir book isn't sketchy at all. John Muir specifically says
to stay the hell out of the transmission. He says you have to be in practice
and he doesn't like to practice that much; furthermore, the job requires
&quot;tools you wouldn't even dream of owning.&quot; Since one of the main tools you
need is a hydraulic press, I don't know if that statement's quite accurate--
I dream about owning a 40-ton press quite a lot, especially when trying to
get something large apart. (I have a six-ton Homier Special, and while it's
not good for things like pressing out bearing races from Bug front wheel
drums--the drum won't fit between the uprights on the press--if you take the
bottom bracket off it works great for removing CVs from their halfshafts.)
