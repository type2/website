Subject: Replacing High Top
Date: Tue, 1 Aug 2000 12:32:59 -0700

After a year delay, I am finally going to be replacing the top on my 72
Adventurewagen.  I found a top in very good condition at a junkyard over a
year ago, and it has been sitting on the side of my house ever since.  

Along the front edge of the existing top, there is a rubber seal between
the top and the bus roof, it appears to be a solid piece of rubber split
down the middle.  The old one is falling apart and will completely fall
apart when I start moving it out of the way to get to the screws holding
the roof on.  I was wondering if anyone has replaced their top on a high
top bus before, and what did you use to replace this piece of rubber?  It
only goes around the front of the top.  I haven't seen anything similar in
the local trailer supply shop, but it seems to be common as most high top
vehicles I see has a similar piece of rubber.

The piece I am talking about can be seen on the front view of my camper at
 http://www.homestead_dot_com/mvandam/vwcamper.html

I plan on using Butyl (??) tape between the top and the roof on the other
three sides of the bus.  This tape is a clay like material in a roll with
an adhesive side.  Is that what most people used?  Seems to me that is
what was used on the original roof.

Thanks for the help,
