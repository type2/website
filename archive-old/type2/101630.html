Subject: 2 big little problems

Hey everyone,
  Here goes it.
I got the bus working yesterday and put the new plates on I went to take it 
on the road and things that were working last week are now mad at me. The 
turn signals on my 76 bus which worked last week are functioning as brake and 
running lights but no longer flash, my horn, also working last week is no 
longer working, and my dash lights, worked last week, are no longer working. 
Anyone have this problem before and if so please tell me its just a fuse!!!! 
Really if it's not tell me anyway.

Thanks in advance,

John
