&gt; &gt; The dude at the parts shop I go to tried to sell me an electronic ignition
&gt; &gt; replacement module instead of putting in new points and condenser. He says
&gt; &gt; he runs one in his bus, and rarely has trouble with it. Does anybody have
&gt; &gt; any info or experience with these devices?
&gt; 
&gt; Gee, I run a points and condensor on my bus and I also &quot;seldom have
&gt; trouble with it&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless you have a really good reason to switch, I'd stick with the points.
&gt; they work well and are easily repaired.

I run a pertronix points eliminator in my 78, haven't noticed any change
for better or worse vs points, I haven't had any problem with em either,
but I do carry a set of points with me anyway...only reason I put em in
was &quot;I just don't like setting points&quot;  with the way the hatches and dizzy
are there just never seemed to be an easy way to see in there and get it
adjusted right so finally said &quot;to heck with it&quot; and spent the $$ to
replace em, same reason I run hyd lifters too.  maybe lazy I don't know
but I don't like phutzing with stuff like that.   

YMMV
