Subject: instrument cluster
Mime-Version: 1.0

Volks,

During my junkyard scavenges, I picked up a VDO clock for my 75 Westy.  It 
was easier just to take the whole instrument panel than remove the clock 
standing there in the cold.  So, I have a instrument cluster (minus the 
clock) from a 1978 bus.  The console material is BROWN (not black.)

All of the lights bulbs were previously removed so it is only the cluster 
housing, fuel guage/warning light and the speedometer (58,000+.)  I will 
toss in the metal piece that covered the clock hole from my 1975 Westy.

I have no need for these items and I would like to give them someone on 
this list. I would be shipping it from Virginia and I only ask for the cost 
of postage.

Please email me if you are in need of these items.

Missy:)
