Subject: Striker for rear hatch

Anyone know of a source for a rear hatch striker plate? It's for  a '68.
As a bare minimum. I need the rubber piece (wedge?) that attaches to the
plate, would like to replace the whole assembly, as the pin is also
worn. Haven't been able to find it listed in any catalogs that I have
(RMMW, WCM, JCW, etc...) A good used one would be ok, what years are
interchangable?   TIA!!
