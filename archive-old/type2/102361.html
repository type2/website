Subject: bulkheads/pedestals

Seems like now we've heard of the late bus with no bulkhead, one bulkhead and two bulkheads. Weird.

&gt;The passenger seat has
&gt;no wall but the swivel seat is in effect.
&gt;Ride backwards.

When me and two friend went up the Pacific Coast Highway for springbreak we had an old oak desk chair in the bus behind the front seat so we could all hear each other while rolling. Whoever was in it was the &quot;Bombardier&quot;
