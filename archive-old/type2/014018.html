What? Yeouch!

&gt;  Did you actually wave, or did you flash a peace sign?
&gt; Do you have a peace sign painted on your bus or maybe
&gt; flowers painted around your headlights? Any and all of
&gt; that will most likely make me turn my head and act
&gt; like I didn't see you when I am on the road.

  Peace Y'all
