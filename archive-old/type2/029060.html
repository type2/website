I too have been reading all of the post about Thermostats as mine broke when
my engine overheated back in may.

I had left it off during my recent rebuild thinking I would install one when
cooler weather set in, I also did not have another bus thermo, however I did
have one for my bug on the shelf.  I had read the type 1 would work with
modifications so I decided to see if I could get mine to work and what
modifications where needed?

There was only one difference in the bus thermo and the type 1 thermo I had:
The screw at the top of the bellows is a different thread pattern, that's
all.

I knew the screw post from the old bus thermo came off,  you  run your wire
thru it to control the flaps, looking at the bug one it looked like it
screwed off also and sure enough it did, once this was done I simply ran my
cable thru the new screw post and installed into my bracket. I did have to
bend my bracket a bit as the screw post and bracket hole did not line up
perfectly.
The bus thermo has an indent where the cable end sits because it has a post
on it, I guess the rod from the bug flaps sit flat on top of the post, my
new bug thermo screw did not screw in as far as before because of the post
and lack of indent, however the bug thermo opens and closes just fine so I
think it will be ok.

Recap:
A type 1 Thermostat can be used in a bus if you remove your cable from the
old screw down post and install the cable thru the bug screw down post, you
might need to bend your bracket as mine did not line up perfectly but did
with help.

As for the difference in operating temps I'm not sure of?

I hope this will help all that are driving around with no thermostat, if you
want one?

Meredith
