Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel bearings

Bill,

Just did this last weekend.

On a 78, the rotors and spindles are separate parts.  You can pull just 
the rotors off and put new ones on, or pull both off at one time and replace 
the bearings.

I took my rotors off first and found that they were out of spec.

Took the spindles off next and cleaned and painted them and then installed 
new bearings in them while I waited for the new rotors to show up.
Cleaned and por-15'd the backing plates while I was at it.


Not a big job unless you are going to paint them.


Cheers ,dave

&gt; Wow,thanks for the fast replies on the mexican hatch seal. Rob is going 
&gt; to let me check it out first hand. Nothing better that seeing with my 
&gt; own eyes. Now another quick question while I have everyone's attention. 
&gt; It's getting real close to leaving for everybus and I am starting to get
&gt; a little nervous. I put a rebuilt engine in,all new 
&gt; hoses,injectors,heater boxes,exhuast and it's running real good. I am 
&gt; going to check the brakes and bearing this weekend and replace the 
&gt; rubber hoses. I also want to flush out all the brake fluid. My question 
&gt; is on the bearings. I have new seals and plan on regreasing them. I've 
&gt; never done it on a bus before and would like some suggestion on how. 
&gt; Also do I have to replace the front bearings if I replace the front 
&gt; rotors?( I do have a Bentley but I left at work).
