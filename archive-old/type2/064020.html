&gt;The wall panels etc on the 81 long ago shed their vinyl and a PO put a
&gt;half-assed coat of paint on them without removing the old glue etc.

Here's a tip for you that worked wonderfully on our '81 Campmobile, Van.
The PO's made no attempt at fixing the panels, and it had LOTS of 
shedding vinly. So I peeled off the vinyl, then painted the panels,
glue and all, with Kilz II. This is a latex based primer sealer paint.
Put several coats on. This stuff works great!! Be sure you get the
latex version, as the original Kilz is alkyd and tolulene based and
the fumes will kilz you. The I took a scrap of the old vinyl to the
paint store and had some interior latex mixed to match it. It has
been two years since Van had its interior paint job, and it still looks
like new. And it was lots easier than replacing panels.
