Subject: Re: [T2] Heat

Heater core?  ;-).  Seriously, I'll have to demonstrate my BA6 heater to you
someday - I had the snow melting off my windshield in a couple of minutes
yesterday.  It is a bit colder today, but it's not snowing anymore.

For the folks not in the middle of the Great White North like James and I
are, we had freezing rain two nights ago, it snowed 13cm (5.25 inches)
yesterday, and today the temperature high was -13C (8F).

James, it was -23C (-9F) when I went to work this morning ;-).

To bring things slightly more on topic, the Nokian CQ tires were great
yesterday.  I didn't get stuck, but I did help push a couple of cars out of
the parking lot at work and a camero through an intersection.
