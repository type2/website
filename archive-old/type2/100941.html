&gt;  Sorry, that is 35 lbs when the pressure regulator uncovers the outlet

&gt; pressure regulator and turned the motor and got 80 lbs pressure, no leaks
&gt; on the injectors or cold start. Pressure very slowly leaked down to 40
&gt; and slower to 30 and seemed to stop, released plug to regulator and
&gt; pressure went down in 3 to 5 seconds.Do you think the regulator is bad.

sure sounds like it
