stop right there. If you are having real problems w/ a fi system then
you really need to just start at the beginning of the bentley FI
section and go through every step. Something is amiss this way you can
find exactly what it is.

Oh on the sensor, you can check 2 places IIRC. One right where the
connection is, but the other is at the other end of the wiring
harness. one of the terms goes directly to the sensor, might be worth
checking the resistance there as well, just to eliminate any bad
connections. consult the bentley for the correct number term.
