&gt;How about the hose for the thermostatic vacuum valve on the air

I'm not sure where it's *supposed* to go but I hooked it up to manifold
vacuum, i.e. the same place as the vacuum retard for the distributor.  That
way when you floor it, the valve will close and you will get cooler air,
and when the bus is idling it will get warm air.

&gt;My two cents on the Jalousie thread... I always called them Louvered
&gt;Windows before joining the list... still works for me. 

Ditto.  Jalousie was a term I had to learn after I joined the list.
