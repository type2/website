Subject: high octain gas

Hi,

I have a new mechanic for my 70 bus after the 4 month nightmare that cost me 
$1200.  Basically my engine is shot.  I have another motor being installed 
tomorrow.

The new mechanic says that I need to run 91 octain gas.  He said that it 
plays an important role in keeping the engine cool.  What's the story?

Jacques
