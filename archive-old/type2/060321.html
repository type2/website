Subject: piston ring gap measurements

I am about to install pistons in cylinders for a 1776 rebuild.  One factor
that lead me to this rebuild was the continuous presence of white vapor
from the exhaust and a way above average oil use. I was hoping the rings
were responsible for this. I inserted one of the old rings into a cylinder
and measured a gap of 0.014,  a value way at the low end of Bentley's range
for new rings. I then took a ring out of the box and measured a value of
0.005 for the gap,  clearly way outside the Bentley range.

Any comments on this 005 value?  Is it bad to have rings that are too tight?

Jack
