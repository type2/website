Subject: Re: [T2] LOST bay wondow

Happy Friday!!!

That was one of the most exhilarating Lost episodes I've seen in a
long time!  At least 10 minute of bus air time!   Can four people
really &quot;right&quot; a bus?  How long would you estimate a pre-72 bus could
sit in a tropical forest, on it's side, and still roll-start? (And
tires retain air...and beer still be palletable..).

Did anybody recognize what part the Japanese man was holding in his
hand while reporting that the engine wouldn't run?
Also, if someone can post a URL to the discussion thread on a
(probably more appropriate place) air-cooled forum that would be
appreciated.
