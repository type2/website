Subject: oil temp

I just took a trip to buses in the woods in NJ, and last week to the beach  in
Va. My temps running 65 were 230F, sump sending unit. Just added temp unit I'm
driving 78 westy deluxe, is this too high? I looked in the archives but seems
a little high. Also creeps up at stops 240F. Coolist I could keep it was 210
at 55mph.Bus content.
I am selling my 74 convertable Karmann Ghia, list car, for detals look at
BARTNO Tek (my ex-karmann ghia)at opening Type2 page. For inquires please
respond by P-mail Komet_at_chesapeake_dot_net .
