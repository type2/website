&gt; Hi Chris,
&gt;
&gt; IIRC the Ural *is actually made from the original BMW tooling taken 
&gt; from Germany after WW2.
&gt;
&gt; It's a great air-cooled design that has stood the test of time. 
&gt; They're near bulletproof with minimal maintenance. Unfortunately the 
&gt; tooling is now 60 years old, so the quality may not be what is used 
&gt; to...
&gt;
&gt; Same deal with old British steel...The Royal Enfield, one of the oldest
bike companies in the world, is still being built in India... ;-(
