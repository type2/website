Subject: RE: [T2] 73 Bus Scariest Car?!?!?!

In all fairness, Tom and Ray did read this on their show after reading their 
list of sacriest cars a few years ago. Someone wrote to them in defense of 
the Bus and they took it with their trademark sense of humor. I poached it 
off their web site and had it stored somewhere on my hard drive. I can't 
believe that it only took, what, three four days to find!


Dear Sirs or Madmen:
Your description of the VW bus was completely accurate, but, alas, 
pathetically unenlightened. Further contemplation will bring you to these 
epiphanic conclusions:

A) If a VW bus shifts in the wind, it is simply because you are on the wrong 
path, heading in the wrong direction. Think of it not as a potentially 
lethal driving hazard but rather as a &quot;spiritual GPS.&quot;

B) Heat? Who among us has actually known heat? Is not one man's boil another 
man's frost? Could it be that the sound of one hand clapping is actually a 
VW driver attempting to at once both shift and survive?

C) Factually, the driver's legs are not the first line of defense. You have 
overlooked the thick layer of bug guts aerodynamically meshed into a natural 
and practically impenetrable polymer covering the bus's front. In addition, 
many buses feature a front- mounted Triplated Independent Repealing 
Emobilizer (TIRE) combining the science of high-cost air bags and the proven 
effectiveness of amusement-park bumper cars.

Finally and most importantly, remember that every VW bus is surrounded by 
the plush and cushioning aura of St. Jerry of Garcia, providing divine 
Truckin' guidance to freaks, Deadheads, 17-year-old wannabe's and balding 
40-something used-to-be's.
