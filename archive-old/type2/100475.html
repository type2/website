Subject: Re: [T2] Bad Noise in my engine

Sqeeking engine noise is: squeeking engine. Careful full examination (my 
friend stepping on the exhaust) reveals: At slow rpms, something is 
vibrating accross something else. I believe it to be a vibrating heater box 
now. Simple, nothing to worry about it turns out. Sorry all, I posted in 
worried haste.

So how do I know for sure? Stick trick. SO in my case I used a long piece of 
pvc pipe. I put one end to my ear, the other to the valve cover, the engine 
itself, and really try to listen to whats going on in the engine. I hear 
sewing machine sounds, valves opening and closeing, pistons moveing, etc. 
They sound fine. We conclude to ignore the strange sound and move on.
