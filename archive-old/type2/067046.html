All,

I know this sort of thing has popped up time and again. But I thought I
would add my $.02 to the pot.  In the same shopping center where the
business I own resides is a rather good BBQ shop (not up to IronWorks
standards, if you happen to know that place), but rather good in its own
right. Out in front of the restaurant is an old Super Beetle, not sure
of the year, but the owner(whom I happen to know) as painted it pink,
and on the hood he has welded a trashcan, and painted to look like a
pigs nose.  On the roof are two pig ears, and on the engine lid is a
piece of tin curled to look like a pig tail.  Although I drive by this
car every day, I didn't give it much thought, until in today's Austin
paper the person who owns the BBQ place is going to do a commercial for
Tide. According to the article, both he and the Pig/Bug (which he named
Road Hog) will be in it. So keep an eye out for the commercial between
Thanksgiving and Christmas. Hopefully the wont cut the car out of the
ad. For those who are passing through, or live in Austin can see the car
in person on Anderson Mill Road, between US183N and FM620 in N.W. Austin

Cheers,

David
