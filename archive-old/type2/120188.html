Subject: Re: [T2] front bumper parts- was OEM Fog Lamps

&gt; Well, they're part number 5A on fiche #055-00, but I
&gt; don't know what they're called.

These are the bumperoverriders for the headlampwashers
(M288). They were introduced with modelyear 1974 and
designed for the Swedish market. I have never seen
them on a US-specifications bus.

The US-overriders are not a German VW part. I think
they were mounted afterwards by the VW-dealership. May
be this is one of those VWoA parts? Or 'VW Corp'?
