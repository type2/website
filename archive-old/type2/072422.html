Greetings Bay Bus list, from a first-time participant and bus revert.

For reasons off-topic to this list I can no longer wrestle with or
crawl around under engines myself and my income is fixed--which is to
say, broken. None of these things dampen my enthusiasm for my new '71
gutted Westy.

So here's this guy in Tampa, who can't work on engines any more for
some reason, but who just bought a vehicle famous for being a healthy
engine tinkerer's best friend? Yep. That's me! &lt;G&gt;

I am making living adjustments 9/30 that will free-up some Westy cash
each month and would appreciated a comment or two on my options with
this (apparently) previously comatose and crotchety old donor bus I am
calling Colonel Rustard.

He has a strong and healthy sounding heart but he is a smoker. I
haven't driven him far enough yet to know how many quarts/day he is
smoking. Exhaust smoke. Whitish blue. Unknown miles. Engine not yet
positively identified but it's an upright and seems to be a 1600.
Dunno if it's the original '71 or a transplant. 

I have tweaked his little 009 dizzy by ear breathing some
standing-start strength back into him, but that's about all I can do.
His high-idle carburetor area looks like something from a Rube
Goldberg cartoon and I'm afraid to disturb the rat's nest of springs
for fear of getting stabbed by flying parts. 'Nuff said.

The smoke is bad from start up, and really never stops. I can see it
(and not much else) billowing up in the back window when old
saggy-butt takes off from a standing start. The cars behind me all
fall back--probably from oxygen starvation. This county (Hillsborough,
in Florida) has just lifted its emissions requirements, but it's not
nice to pollute mother nature and worse to make a show of it.

I live only a few miles from Tampa's somewhat renowned Fisher Buggies
and their counter staff has been courteous and helpful in offering
some (pricey) options. In doing that, they have also burst my bubble
of blissful ignorance. I thought a new set of jugs, rings, and
pistons, was in order. &quot;Great,&quot; they said, &quot;But! . . .&quot; 

The &quot;but&quot; part was that a brand new top end could easily and
unexpectedly &quot;spin a bearing&quot; in the core, meaning the whole tear-down
job starts over, the &quot;top&quot; investment is a wash, and the core might
get rod-punched and become worthless as a trade.

The &quot;top&quot; was quoted at roughly $95 parts, $250 labor. The core
replacement was quoted at $700, and labor at $350, with the hedge that
by the time all the little bits and pieces get transferred and
upgraded/fixed things would most likely land in the $1500-$2000 range.
As a final alternative, the fellow suggested I might want to see how
long it goes before fouling a plug. Disheartened, I left after paying
$1.75 for a new Matchbox-like split-window (made in China). 

Unless a $350 motor falls from the sky, or some list guru has a better
idea, it looks like I'll choose Door #3, and just let him smoke for a
while. &lt;wince&gt;

BTW, I have a photos of two of my three previous buses at the link
below my sig and any guesses as to their forgotten years of
manufacture would be much appreciated.
