Hi Jim,

Sounds like the perfect answer for a singlecab or double-cab, they wouldn't
have to put it on the roof, it could go in one of the lower bulkheads.

If I sealed the space under the rear-facing seat airtight, would an EU2000i
fit? How many decibels does it crank out?

One more thing to put into the WesTrailier I want to build this spring.


Happy trails,

&gt; Okay guys, the heck with it. This is what you do:
&gt; 
&gt; Step 1: Get a roof rack. Westies and Rivieras already have one. Build a
&gt; fairing on your roof rack to keep snow and rain off.
&gt; 
&gt; Step 2: Purchase a Honda EU2000i generator and secure it to the roof rack.
&gt; It weighs 43 pounds and burns a quart of gas every hour. Run a power cable
&gt; from the generator to the inside of your Bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Step 3: Buy any 1500-watt space heater and plug it in.
&gt; 
&gt; It's quiet, it will last a long time, it's cheap to run if not to buy, and
&gt; when winter's over you'll be able to run your refrigerator, desktop
&gt; computer, window air conditioner or whatever you want from it.
