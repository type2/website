Subject: Re: [T2] Friday's Mystery Part

Thanks everyone for the input! I just ran around with a friend to the FLAPS
and Advance. The FLAPS didn't have a plug and neither did Advance. I didn't
see anything at Ace Hardware that looked good enough.

What I'm going to try is to clean up the old plug and use JB Weld to put it
back in. I'd love to tap out the hole but I just did an overhaul (not two
weeks ago). I'll fix this right the next time I have the engine apart.

BTW, I did loose ALL my oil. I was worried that it wasn't the rear main seal
because of the volume of oil lost. Fortunately for me, I had just come out the
warm up the bus before leaving for school. It was a VERY cold morning (for TN
anyhow) and I hadn't even gotten the engine running long enough to start
scraping the frost from the windshield when the oil pressure warm light
flickered on. I immediately killed the engine and looked underneath. Then I
got my roommate to drive me to school.

I did make a couple mods to the engine to make removal even easier next time.
I moved my electric fuel pump to the back engine tin from the fuel tank
firewall (so I only have to disconnect the line from the gas tank and can
leave the positive lead connected. I put sheilded spade connectors on all my
instrument sending wires just north of the firewall (so I don't have to
disconnect and rethread). I also pulled just the engine this time, leaving
transmission in. It was harder to maneuver but came out alot faster. Taking
the CV joint bolts out is very time consuming!

-Eric
