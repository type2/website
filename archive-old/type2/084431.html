Subject: heater cable

Oh, type II sages....I've got a big ole mess on my hands!  when replacing
the right heater cable, it broke off inside the tube that runs from front
to back.  It and the rubber coating are stuck in there.  Does anyone have a
magical answer on how to get the old cable out short of replacing the
entire cable tube or clamping a replacement tube right next to it.  It does
get cold occasionally here in north florida and I'm a wimp in the cold.
Thanks!  Greg
