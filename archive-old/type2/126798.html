Subject: Chrome Grille Surround

Hiya All,

I really need some ideas here.  Especially from any of you who have a metal 
working background or any experience with the chrome trim on a Bus.

The details.....had the Bus painted.  The chrome grille surround on the nose 
of the Bus no longer fits properly.  The &quot;bead&quot; is now too wide to fit in the 
space between the grille and the body.  I'm assuming that this is due to the 
new paint.  I did have the surround stripped, polished, and reanodized.

Well, I don't want to force it in and scrape the paint. So..............any 
ideas out there on how I might go about getting this surround to fit properly?  
All my thoughts lead me to somehow compressing the &quot;bead&quot; to make it a bit 
smaller.  But how would I do that?  What tool could I use?  Better yet, where 
could I go?

Scratching my head,

Mike
