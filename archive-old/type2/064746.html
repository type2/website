Subject: Re: did the brakes, new axle leak problem

Joe Gindhart sed:

&gt;Anyway, I drained the
&gt;box, then closed it up to see what would happen if I left it empty for a
&gt;couple of hours. When I came back it was nearly half full again of clean
&gt;gear oil. I presume this is coming from the transmission case. Is this
&gt;normal? If not, what does it mean?

Yes, and it's normal.

&gt;
&gt;Next problem: Removed the bearing cover to change the seals. Gear oil oozed
&gt;out of the bearings while I had the bearing cover removed. The seal kit
&gt;given to me by the FWVAPS (kit # 113 598 315, but on the price tag it says
&gt;#111 598 051A) has an orange paper gasket, 2 rubber rings, 2&quot; and 3/4&quot;,

those are o-rings

&gt; a
&gt;flat metal washer,

this is an oil thrower, not for buses, only for Beetles

&gt;that hard plastic thingy with the rubber washer and
&gt;spring inside it,

this is the axle oil seal

&gt;and a cotter pin. Well, the only things I could find in
&gt;there were the hard plastic thingy and the paper gasket. Where do the other
&gt;parts go? Did they give me the wrong kit? The metal washer and the small
&gt;rubber ring don't fit on the axle. The big rubber ring was the same size as
&gt;the inside of the bearing cover, so I figured it goes there.

Right

&gt; I have Muir,
&gt;the RMMW catalog, and another manual, and couldn't figure it out. I put
&gt;everything back together, and now I have tranny fluid leaking from the
&gt;between the axle and the bearing cover. HELP!

The small o-ring goes over the axle before you put the spacer back on. This
(I think) is where you're leaking now. If you look at the inside face of
the spacer, you'll see it is beveled to fit the o-ring.

For doing this job on the bus, you should have fitted:
1) Paper gasket between brake backing plate and bearing cover;
2) Oil seal in bearing cover;
3) Large o-ring between bearing cover and brake backing plate; and
4) Small o-ring between spacer and bearing.

Hope this helps
