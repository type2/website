Subject: Restore or Not

Volks:
I'm faced witha dilemma. When I purchased my 71 Westy, I was pretty sure I
was going to fully restore it. I have been replacing all the rusted panels
with new metal, re-did the brakes, rebuilt the engine.  Now months and a lot
of money later, I'm not so sure. I still need to replace all window rubber,
repair a few small dents, replace the bottom portion of the nose, the beam
behind it, and have it painted. almost forgot, I also need to replace the
canvas. As you can see, quite a bit left.
On the good side, the bus drives great, and the interior is in very good
shape. I'm leaning towards doing a partial restoration, new rubber, MAACO
paint job,etc. It just kills me to do stuff half ass, but I don't want to
put lots of money into it and then receive orders to go overseas(I'm in the
Army) and end up having to sell it. What do you guys think? any comments,
suggestions will be appreciated. Best regards

Victor
