&gt;Time is getting close to John Brown's Buses held in Harpers Ferry, West
&gt;
&gt;Virginia.  The campout is 66 mile from Washington D.C. and 68 miles from
&gt;
&gt;Baltimore.  I created a site with some information and local 
&gt;attractions.  http://www.home.earthlink_dot_net/~theauchs/JBB.htm.
&gt;Hope to see you!
