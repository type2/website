Subject: Re: The Dreaded R1 Double Relay Resistor = 2.7 ohms

Matt,

Glad to hear you are up and running. You may have unearthed a common Bus 
problem. And saved the price of a new relay ($80 from Rocky Mtn).

The 20 ohm measurement was with a 3 volt ohm meter. The ohm meter has to 
over come the diode forward bias (0.7V). You would get a higher reading if 
you use a 1.5 V ohm meter or a different meter range.

I think that the resistor is there to reduce the stress on the relay coil. 
The coil is designed to pull in at about 7 or 8 volts to make sure of a pull 
in when the battery is loaded during starting. Also the forward drop of the 
diode must be included in the pull in calculation.

In the run condition the relay coil voltage would jump up to 13 volts with 
out the resistor. Current would be almost twice the starting condition. This 
will be hard on the relay coil over the long run.

You can measure the resistance of the coil and the resistor in series. You 
measured ~200 ohms I measured 65 ohms(86b to 85). THERE IS NO NON LINEAR 
RESISTANCE (DIODE) IN THIS MEASUREMENT. Pick the resistor value based on 
this measurement not the measurement involving the diode. Keep this value up 
to ~ 13/.2 or 65 ohms for a safe coil current of ~ 200 MA.

I also measured the resistance of the diode (in the forward mode) and 
resistor in series over 20 ohms (86a to 86b). THERE IS A NON LINEAR 
RESISTANCE (DIODE) IN THIS MEASUREMENT. It is affected by the meter design.

Anyway this is a classic design margin problem. Bring it up at school.

Later
Chuck

&gt;Hi Chuck,
&gt;
&gt;Good news my friend. The bus is in motion. It was the dreaded crispy fried 
&gt;R1 resistor in the double relay. The problem was I couldn't see the 
&gt;resistor color code. Anyway I went to the university lab and desoldered the 
&gt;resistor to take a look at the back. Not much color there either. I know 
&gt;the first band is red (2), the second band is gray or violet (8 or 7), the 
&gt;third I beleive is gold or black(x 0.1 or x1), and the fourth is of course 
&gt;the tolerance gold. So I think that it was a 2.7 or 27 ohm resistor.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know if you have time to read all this so...
&gt;
&gt;CONCLUSION (in case you are tired)
&gt;
&gt;I ended up installing the 2.7 ohm and it gave me an impedance at pin86b of 
&gt;65 ohms.
&gt;
&gt;THINKING OUT LOAD (please correct me if I'm wrong)
&gt;
&gt;I thought 2.7 ohms to be very small so I first tried the 27 ohm. It gave me 
&gt;an impedance of 90 ohms at the 86b pin. I remember you saying that you had 
&gt;20 ohms on yours. I was surprised that it was that high. Essentially the 
&gt;resistor is in parallel with the diode and then they connect in series with 
&gt;the coil. A 27 ohm resistor in parallel to a high resistance diode should 
&gt;basically give a 27 ohm resistance? But it gave me 90 ohms. So I stuck in 
&gt;the 2.7 ohm and I measured the impedance at 86b and found 65 ohms. This is 
&gt;as low as I could go so that's what stayed. I tested the relay with a 12 V 
&gt;at 86b and it worked. BIG SMILE :). So I put it in the bus and away she 
&gt;went. I went for an hour drive and it ran beautifully. Very 
&gt;smooooooooooooth.
&gt;So problem solved. Oh yeah I could only get a 1/4 W Resistor at school so I 
&gt;will have to pick up a 1/2 W and pop it in for safe measures. Hopefully the 
&gt;system has been hugely over designed. Haha.
&gt;
&gt;Well if you read this far sorry for keeping you. But I really appreciate 
&gt;your help. You were very good guidance. It's hard to diagnos a problem when 
&gt;you don't even see it.
&gt;
&gt;So by the way how is your bus running? What year is it? When did you get 
&gt;it? Where do you live again? Is it warm there this time of year?
&gt;
&gt;Later,
&gt;
&gt;Matt
