&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm just about out of ideas on this one, so I turn to your incredible 
&gt;&gt;knowledge.
&gt;
&gt;Having just gone through this myself, I would almost guarantee that you 
&gt;have a lot of gunk in your fuel tank

but after saying that 
&gt;&quot;I can give it more gas and accelerate through or back off the gas and it 
catches.&quot;

I'd be inclined to look at the ignition and then the FI before thinking 
about the tank..

My Reasons:

If you were suffering from fuel starvation due to gunk on an FI bus, 
you'd probably have the following symptoms:

noisy fuel pump = sucking gas out of the tank. (mine was at all rpm's)

stalling at high rpms's - you wouldn't be able to 'gas through' it 
because the fuel pump was already delivering all it could when it started 
stalling.

when you change the fuel filter you get a minor dribble out the fuel 
lines..

with the engine running, the larger diameter fuel line (filter to fuel 
pump) gets compressed under suction.

my bus had all of these symptoms + stalling on left turns at speed.

being able to 'gas through' a fuel starvation problem to me rules out 
delivery from the tank.

just my .02
