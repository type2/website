Subject: Re: [T2] wiring in a stereo-amp

&gt;there are wires everywhere and none of the wiring diagrams i can find seem 
&gt;to match.
&gt;
Sam,
     Are you mounting the amp near the cab or near the rear of the vehicle?  
I ran a 6 gauge wire from the battery up to just underneath my front seat, 
becaue of the length of the wire run. Hooked up a fuse-distribution block. 
It works great!  The ground should go to the body of the vehicle, and should 
be less than 18 inches long.

Ciao,

Eron
