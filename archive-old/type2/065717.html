&gt; I've got a '71 pop-top in which I'd like to put an original German Solex
&gt; 34 PICT-3 carbuerator. The carb is not perfect, however, in that the
&gt; throttle shaft is loose where it goes throught the body of the carb on
&gt; one side. It tends to leak a little gas.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm told that this is a common problem with old 34 PICT-3s.
&gt; 
&gt; I know of one company, the Carberator Refactory in Richmond, Califonia,
&gt; that repairs these carbs by enlarging the whole the shaft runs through
&gt; and pressing in a bronze bushing. The shaft then runs through the
&gt; bushing, which is drilled to fit perfectly. I don't have the money to
&gt; buy a rebuilt carb from them, but I was thinking of having the bushing
&gt; put in by a local (Seattle) machine shop, then rebuilding the carb
&gt; myself.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone ever done this? The machine shop I spoke to said that I would
&gt; have to come up with the bushing myself, then they would figure out what
&gt; it would take to put it together.

FWIW, 

There is a bearing company in Huntington Beach, CA (So Cal) that carries 
metric bushings in stock. I dont know there number off hand. Metric 
bushings are really hard to find, so you might try looking these guys up. 
The number is in the (714) area code. If anybody is interested, post to 
me and I will try to find it to post on a message
