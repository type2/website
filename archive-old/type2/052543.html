Subject: Re: [T2] Intake Manifold question

[...]


&gt; Would anyone happen to know where I could find a dual-port Intake Manifold
&gt; for my bus? I just bought a new 34PICT3 carb for my dual port engine but
the
&gt; stock 70 carb and manifold were still on it from before and so the new
carb
&gt; will not fit until I find one.  Thanks for any help...

You lost me here......
&quot;the stock 70 carb and manifold were still on it&quot; means it is a single port
manifold with a 30 pic something carb. Dual port as a stock set-up only came
on a 71 USA bus.
