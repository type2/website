Subject: RE: [T2] transport suggestions

Morgan,

I used DAS with great results.

I moved a 78 bay from OR to MD in 13 days for $1200 with insurance.

I was very happy with them.. they gave you the ability to track your
shipment over the web, and they were very prompt with all of their
schedules.

Dave
