Can you say, &quot;Periodic Maintenance Inspection.&quot; Both the rotor and
the belt would have looked like s**t months before. If you had kept
notes on when those parts were last replaced/inspected you could
have anticipated a future potential problem and replaced them at your
leisure, saved a days pay, not endangered yourself, your kinder or
the general public, and instead of having to invent a mother of a
intermediate solution, you could have spent all that wasted time
with stress relief activity instead of stress creation.

Howard was LOM squared, Lots of Miles and Lack of Maintenance.
If you have to carry spare parts for daily driving, you are 
anticipaing failure. If you do not compromise basic maintenance
procedures, you are insuring success and don't need to carry
any spare parts. You can leave those spares on the garage shelf
in case they are needed at the next scheduled inspection.

The Deutscshes Methode will set you free, reduce your cost per
mile, protect you from perils, and improve your life.
