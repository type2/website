Subject: Re: Aftermarket sunroof

&gt;&gt; &gt;I want a sunroof in my '74 bus and I am thinking of installing an after
&gt;&gt;market
&gt;&gt; &gt;unit. The archives seem to indicate that this can be done.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Any recommendations re manufactures?
&gt;

    Shouldn't the frame be strengthened if you're going to
    chop a hole in the roof? I've seen replacement parts meant
    for sunroof type 2s, special braces to compensate for the
    sunroof.
