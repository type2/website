&lt;&lt; Hello,

I recently posted a message about revving high.
Could a fouled spark plug increase the revs on the engine.
or the point gap or a worn distrubutor shaft.
grasping for reason!!!
1972 van FI converted into a weber single carb.

Thanks

Have you checked the linkage on the carb completely to see
if there's any binding that will keep the throttle open...Also,
and it's a stretch, have someone work the gas pedal while 
you watch the carb...Depending on the mount for the carb,
they can tip slightly, jamming or holding the cable enough to
keep the idle up...
