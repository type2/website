&gt; Anyone ever have any experience with oil slinging past the oil
slinger washer, hitting the pulley and making a nice mess of the
motor?  This is a sudden development on a normally reliable 1600 dp
with about 11K on it.  Any ideas how to fix?

In a stock engine, this is where the air that ventilates the crankcase
enters the engine.  If it is all of a sudden coming out, then you
either are getting a lot of blowby (bad news) or you have a vent hose
problem (not so bad news).  Make sure that the hose from the oil fill
is in good condition and correctly attached to the air cleaner.  This
connection provides a slight vacuum that keeps air moving in the
correct direction through the crankcase.

If all this is good, then you are faced with the prospect of excessive
blow-by.  Do a compression check and see if you have a low cylinder. 
Your engine is low milage, but if it was a crate rebuild it might be
reaching the end of its warranty (and expected life as well)
