I'll try to make this short, but I want you to know where this is
coming from.  I am a teacher at a very small school.  A single
Mother I met who has two young sons enrolled in our school
recently had a non-running bus towed to the local scrap yard.  I
was bummed that she didn't tell me about it sooner, but it sounds
like it was in pretty bad shape.  Anyway, during the conversation
I found out she had the official service manual.  Since I know
she is short on money I offered to try to sell it for her.  I
have it in my possession now and even though my Bentley is
falling apart and has greasy finger prints all over it I'm
willing to pass this one on.

1968 to 1979 Bentley Service Manual.
The cover is slightly dog eared and looks a little worn.
The very bottom of the first few pages look like they may have
gotten wet at sometime.
The rest of the book looks brand new.  I don't think this manual
was ever used.
Book goes to the highest bidder.
I'll reply to all bidders.
Please e-mail me off the list.

The good news.  She says that if I can't sell it, she will keep
it with the hopes that she will get another bus someday.
