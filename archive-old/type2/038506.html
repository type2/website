Subject: Secrets for Removing Slotted Plugs?

Does any one have a technique for extracting a slotted
plug (4 actually) that have been locktited in. They're
in the holes which go from (next to) the intake
manifold down into the exhaust port (1700).  I want to
remove the plugs and use the large hex bolts which are
supposed to hold the tin AND plug the hole.

The plugs are about 1&quot; down in their holes. I'm going
to try grinding down a screwdriver, but so far its
looking grim.  I don't have a torch.  Any ideas? 

Thanks
