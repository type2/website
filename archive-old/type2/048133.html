I have seen an electric bus . it was a 69 i asked about its range ( a modern
electric car gets about 50-70 miles max) and was told about 25 miles. i was really
impressed then another one of the builders(students) chimed in &quot;it usually gets
around 3 miles&quot; not very practical, at least with the set up they had. LPG or
hybrid seems to be a more functional conversion.. there is also a guy i saw who
had converted a diesel bus to run on vegetable oil, pretty neat. I have also seen
an electric vanagon which had a more practical setup, 30 mile avg range.  look in
the type2 library i think there is some stuff in there on the topic

&gt; To help keep this topic bus related, has anyone done any electric
&gt; conversions in their busses?
