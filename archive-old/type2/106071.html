Subject: Re: 74 bus basically no idle

In my first post I mentioned that my engine is not exactly stock which
explains the compression readings. Here are the engine specs again:
Built by Kummetat in Essen (Germany), 2L high compression P&amp;Cs (most
likely dome top), 296 cam (measured by German standards, not as hot as
it sounds as it is measured at a different lift than U.S. specs), large
valve heads, Solex 36-40 PDSIT carbs. This is more or less a 914 GB
(Euro-spec dual carb 100hp) setup.
 
&gt; Dry    wet
&gt; 160    190
&gt; 185    225
&gt; 155    200
&gt; 180    185

Despite the high compression, I still have a problem - why does it not
run properly? It's not ignition (ruled out) and I doubt it is vacuum
related - see my previous post. Carbs do need to be tuned, but this
problem occured from one day to another which tells me that it cannot
just be an adjustment issue.
