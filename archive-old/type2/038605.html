Subject: Re: oil light

[...]

&gt; I'm a recent owner of a '71 Westy and I've been going through the interior
&gt; cleaning things up. Consequently, I haven't driven it a lot. In the last
&gt; couple times out, I've noticed the oil light comes on
&gt; at idle, after coming up to temperature. Right now, I'm running 40 wt. oil
&gt; and I'm thinking of going to 20/50. I rev her a little and it goes out.
Yes,
&gt; the oil level is correct.

Before I switched oil weights, I would replace the oil sending unit.  If the
light still came on at idle, I would put a manual gauge in the sending unit
hole and verify the true oil pressure.
