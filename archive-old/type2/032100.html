Subject: Re: Poptop Canvas Install without Plastic Strip

&gt; Regarding the comment on installing the canvas without a plastic strip.
&gt; I have posted I believe about my install of a poptop canvas from Bus
&gt; Depot. Careful comparison to the original showed me there was not enough
&gt; height from the holdown runner to allowing the 1&quot; overlap you need at
&gt; the top to install around the plastic strip.  I'm sorry I pulled out all
&gt; those staples from the strip before realizing this.

I remember the pulling out the staples part. I'm sure you were bummed.

&gt; ...A cover edging available from a fabric shop was used
&gt; to hide the myriad staples that were used...

Clever idea. I searched far and wide for a replacement for my rock hard
plastic strip to no avail. But I didn't go to a fabric shop.

&gt;      By installing the aluminum strip at the bottom first, I got a neat
&gt; install of the bead under it.  I determined that stapling the canvas
&gt; flush to the ceiling at the top got me plenty of tightness, and so did
&gt; it with the top slightly lowered and held by 2x4's running to the floor.
&gt; I used an electric stapler with 9/16&quot; staples.

So obviously one can successfully install a new canvas bottom first, or
top first, if one is clever and persistent. I wonder how the factory did
it the first time?
