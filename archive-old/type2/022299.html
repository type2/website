I've ask before but haven't really got anything, I would like to convert
my bay into a camper and i need ideas and plans about  cupboards and
'fire' and cabinets and cupboards and stove and sinks and fridge and
such, don't care about pop top thanks fer any help
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;..
OK, you asked for opinions...and don't care about pop-tops....so, keep the 
conversion to a minimum. Make your bay work as a camper by building 
portable modules that can be stored outside the bus. You need a kitchen 
module, and a clothing bag/case, and a low water-tight roof pod for the 
folding chairs and table and misc. stuff.
I have had a 1976 Westfalia since new. Many campings over 25 years in the 
USA and Europe verify to me that the most useful item (to me)is the bench 
seat that unfolds into a bed. I would build that into my conversion. ALL 
the other Westy stuff is very nice and useful and well-designed, and I 
dearly love it, but you could build a plywood box about 3 feet high and two 
feet wide and a foot deep, with a piano hinged door and good latches, and 
make it your portable kitchen. Put handles on each side to carry it in and 
out of the bus. Set it up on a bench/table at the campsite.   Get a 3-way 
portable refrigerator (runs on 12vDC, 120vAC, propane)for a few hundred 
dollars. Sit it on the floor in the cargo bay when traveling. Also carry a 
conventional ice chest.....lasts a few days. Freeze a few gallons of water 
in plastic bottles before the trip. Buy bags of ice as you travel if the 
trip is a long one. Put the fridge outside at night and run it on propane 
when you aren't traveling, if the campsite doesn't have electricity. Carry 
a long power cord in case it does. Also carry a small portable folding 
table and several folding chairs, and a propane camp stove, and a few 
gallons of distilled water. And a propane lantern to hang outside at night. 
You can think of whatever else you might find convenient, maybe an 
insect-protected dining tent or fly. Carry lots of the folding stuff in a 
pod on the roof or on a roof rack, securely tied down. Or, pull a really 
small (500-600 pounds) two wheel trailer behind your bay, if you don't want 
the inside cluttered with camping stuff.  I have a 1968 Cox canvas-top 
fold-down camper that I pull sometimes, even though I have the Westfalia 
pop-top. It unfolds and ends up looking like a modern day covered wagon. 
Very light to tow. Very easy to live with. Considerable inside storage 
space. The Westy pulls it just fine. We carry down parkas with hoods plus 
sleeping bags and woolen underwear, so we don't need a night-time heat 
source and can open the windows in the bus and keep the humidity lower. It 
gets chilly about 2 AM even on some summer nights, but they are very 
helpful for spring and fall camping. A small electric heater is OK if the 
camp has an electric source. Yes, putting in louvered/sliding pane and 
screened windows on each side would help with ventilation. You could use 
magnets sewn into tubes at the edges of the screen to hold on the screens 
on the bus when you want them in place. Same idea works for a rear-hatch 
screen, or a sliding door screen, or screens on the front windows. If you 
want to camp in bear country, re-think the whole system and keep it and 
yourself where the bears can't get at you. And they are remarkably smart 
and strong and determined. I try to stay where there aren't any.
