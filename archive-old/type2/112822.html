Subject: Re: [T2] Overhead Consoles

Folks -

I mounted an Audiovox flip-down LCD-TV between the front seats on Itch ('69 
Westy). A Lasonics 8090 CD/DVD player fits nicely between the &quot;roof&quot; and the 
pop-top. The wiring between the DVD player and the LCD-TV &quot;sneaks&quot; along the 
driver's side tent base, down the front-left corner of the sunroof opening, 
and into the &quot;ceiling&quot;, coming down thru the ceiling panel where appropriate 
for the LCD-TV. All very stealth.

I ran another power wire up through the driver's side &quot;A&quot; pillar (where the 
dome light wire routes), and I'm sure you can get 3-4 14AWG-type wires up 
through there (for temp sensors, etc..), if you're patient.

Because of the arc of the Westy ceiling, most people don't even realize the 
LCD-TV's up there, unless of course, it's on. Looks very &quot;factory&quot;.

&gt;&gt;looks-like-factory-if-only-they-had-thought-of-it.
