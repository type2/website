Subject: auxiliary air regulator

Hi list

I just removed the auxiliary aire regulator (valve?) from my 78 EFI.
There is a small rubber elbow attached to it, about half an inch in
diameter. There is a quite a bit tear in it. This might explain why the
engine stops after 30 seconds unless I unplug the AFM. Would that black
rubber elbow be something we could find at a FLAP?

Thanks for you input.
