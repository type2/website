Subject: RE; Quick timing question

Greg-

I run the same distributor on an 1800 and it sounds like you aren't getting
any vacuum advance, since 24 degrees is about what I'd expect from the
centrifgal advance only. Check the vacuum port, the hose, and the vacuum
can. make sure the breaker plate is free to move when vacuum is applied.

Probably something simple. Good luck.

&gt; hey list, I just checked my timing and noticed that at about 3000 rpm,
&gt; the timing is only advancing to about 24 total degrees according to the
&gt; scale.  I've checked the archives and see lots of talk about total
&gt; advance being 38-40 degrees.  At idle, it's timed at 7.5 degrees btdc.
&gt; Idles beautifully...do I have a problem?
