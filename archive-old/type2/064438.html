&gt;secondly, when it comes to used vehicles in general, you are never going to
&gt;get back what you put into it. i have a '74 with a westy interior, new cv
&gt;joints, new tires, new brakes, new front end, rebuild engine, and solid body
&gt;but don't think i could get all the $2000 plus i've put into it. just don't
&gt;happen unless you find someone who doesn't know any better. that's just to
&gt;be expected from a 20+ year old vehicle.

i understand what you are saying. if i wanted to get out everything i put 
into it, i'd have to be asking $10,000. it's very sad. i don't know how 
much i can get for it, but if i have to go too low, i won't sell it.

&gt;unless of course it's a barndoor or older splittie. or a van like ric is
&gt;selling. he's put thousands of $$$'s in it, yet knows he can't sell it for
&gt;what'd he like to get for it.but considering the year of the van, i don't 
&gt;think
&gt;you'll get $5885. perhaps if the body was perfect, glass wasn't broken, all
&gt;acessories were working, canvas was in excellent shape.

however, i've been watching the local ads, and i seem to be in the 
general price range.

&gt;again, i didn't 

thanks for clarifying!
