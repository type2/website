Subject: Re: [T2] devil dog

Googling &quot;devil-dog northwest-electric&quot; reveals (barely) that it's some sort
of antique car alarm.

Googling &quot;devil-dog alarm&quot; reveals further that:
(1) It uses a basic motion sensor to detect attempts at &quot;theft&quot;
(2) It apparently uses the vehicle's horn as the alarm &quot;siren&quot;
(3) It was standard equipment on the Plymouth Roadrunner in the late 1960s

So, anyway, there you have it...
