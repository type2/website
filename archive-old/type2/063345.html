Subject: What's the biggest box you've fit in your split?

Howdy!

Yesterday I thought I'd be a cool dad and by my daughter a swing set.  I
assumed that it would come in a big box but it would probably fit in the SOs
Honda with the back seat folded down.  Not.  I measured the box and it was
9'4&quot; long and about 2.5' wide and about 2.5' high.  Scratch the Honda.  Oh
yeah, I've got a microbus at home, lemme go get that.  I thought that if I
put the back seat into bed mode it might fit...my bus is a non-walkthrough
so it could be tight.

It fit!  9'4&quot; long from the rear left corner to the front side door, no
problem.  This is a '67 Rusty with all cabinetry(sp?) except the sink in
case you were wondering.  I was impressed.  I was also impressed that the
*(_at_#^$% swing set was harder to assemble than the bus!
