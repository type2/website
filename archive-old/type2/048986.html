Subject: ADMIN - Re: [T2] [F]Hemp, Hippies, and the decline of western civili[s|z]ation

Hello all,
I thank the Type2 list members for not posting to Type2 on this thread, and
this message is to preclude anyone who might be thinking about posting to
Type2 on this thread.  Don't.

This is a Bus mailing list.  Hemp, hippies and the decline of western
civilization are not appropriate topics.  Now Buses -- there's a topic.

Thom, this really didn't need to be cross-posted to Type2.
