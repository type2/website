Subject: Check out Craftsman Torque Wrench, 3/8 in. Drive at sears_dot_com.

Click here: Craftsman Torque Wrench, 3/8 in. Drive at sears_dot_com. 

I think since I`m a beginner, and I`ll probably forget to set the torque 
wrench  to it`s lowest point. I`ll buy the sears torque wrench which is less 
expensive.

    Thanks Again,
