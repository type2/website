A few things you may want to think of...

&gt; I'm thinking of cutting the body at the post behind the drivers
&gt; compartment (cab) and adding a new sheetmetal 'nose'.  
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I've divulged my evil plan......  Any ideas about how to add
&gt; the tow-tongue?  What about brakes? etc...  I've never attempted

If you remove the front wheelss and just add a tongue, virtually all the
real weight of the bus and cargo will become &quot;tongue weight&quot;  that means
it will all be pressing DOWN upon the ball and hitch assembley attatched
to the tow vehicle.  Not bad if you are going to add a 5th wheel hitch....

You'll notice most trailer have their wheels in gthe general vicinity of
their center of gravity...That, and distributing the weight front/rear
helps the trailer keep itself level, instead of relying on the tow vehicle
to keep it up.

You COULD cut the bus so short so as to compensate for this, but you would
probably end up with it cut just behind the sliding door!  (now, cut it in
the middle of the rear indow, and add the rear of another bus to that
one.....:)

might want to consider what it would take to make it a 4 wheeler...

later...david
