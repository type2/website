Subject: Insurance Deal

I finally got my '64 Ford Crewcab insured.  Been worrying that it 
would be too expensive.  Checked around and found a CHEAP way to 
insure it.  Since it is over 25 years old (this is where the VW 
content kicks in) it can be considered an *antique* vehicle.
And this list has LOTS of vehicles that coud rate as antiques.
If it is in essentially original or restored condition, it can qualify. 
 
There is a catch though.  This kind of policy is intended 
for vehicles that are primarily used (or claimed as such) for public 
display.  Parades, shows, and the like.  There is also a 2000 mile per 
year limit.  Cost for 6 months, $39.  No that's not a mistype.  They 
never looked at my odometer.  I only use the truck sparingly and 
usually just to go to the dump or haul stuff around on my property.
But it's in basically original condition.  I'll contact a few poeple 
to see if they want to use it for a parade next year.

California laws are changing at the new year to say that the police 
can ask for proof of insurance at a traffic violation stop.  Lots of 
dollars fine and loss of license for a year!  So I got motivated to 
comply.  (I have other opinions on this subject, but in deference to 
bandwidth will withhold)

I do know of someone who has this type of insurance and installed a 
second speedometer in their highly modified performance *show* car
that's over 25 years old.  Maybe they insured it before the mods?
