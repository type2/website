&gt; What would be #1? CV joints? Oh, how about replacing the fuel tank on a

&gt; &gt; I did #1 and did it while my engine was already out for another reason.
&gt; &gt; used &quot;stubby&quot; screwdrivers and I still have to say it rates in the top 3
&gt; &gt; as the biggest PITA jobs I have ever done on a bus.....

CV joints aare not hard, just messy... in the PITA catagory the one I am
working on now is #1  but in no particular order

.  the fuel filler hose
.  gas gauge sender (without cutting hole or removing engine)
.  adjusting the auto tranny shift linkage
.  the auto tranny cable linkage at the rear

I'm sure there are a few I haven't found yet.
