Subject: re: owner's manuals

I called the number posted this morning.  1-800-334-0688.  They
primiarly have domestic manuals.

However he gave me the number of a a place Schiff European Automotive
401-946-4711.

I spoke to the guy.  Seemed like a nice guy.  He say's he has lot of
manuals.  I asked him what years and he said all of them.

I have a 72 westy.  He said that I could get the VW manual (refered to
it as new used) for $39.95, and I could get a suppliment for $14.95 for
the westy stuff in it.  THese prices are typical for the new used
manuals.
