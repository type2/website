&gt; Hey y'all
&gt; Been busy with life, camping, and tournament season but I
&gt; have a question.  Those of you who bought new engines,
&gt; what did you do to them before the first start?
&gt;  Specifically, did you prime the oil system, retorque
&gt; everything etc.

1. drill and tap for thermostat
2. put long stud in upper case for intake manifold
3. install distributor drive
4. remove distributor drive and reinstall correctly
5. Make sure that moustache bar bolts thread all the way into their holes
(inserts may not have the inner &quot;tang&quot; broken off correctly)
6. Adjust valves
7. fill with oil
8. install in vehicle
9. remove center wire in coil
10. crank until oil light goes out.
11. connect coil
12. start engine, run at 2000RPM for 20 minutes (by the clock)
13. change oil
14. drive 200 miles
15. Change oil.

After breaking a head stud on one of my new Mexican engines, I'd be
tempted to replace all the head studs with used German studs and retorque
the heads.  This is relatively easy before the tin goes on.  Ronnie
reports that the Mexican studs aren't torqued to the same 18 ft-lb that
the German ones were.  I recall that he measured 14 ft-lb.

I'd recommend buying from Ronnie rather than Beetlemex.  As I understand
it, some engines (including the ones that Ronnie sells) are boxed from the
factory while others are assembled from new parts by small shops.  Ronnie
has better info than I on this.  Beetlemex sells their engines through
GEX, a business I will have nothing to do with.
