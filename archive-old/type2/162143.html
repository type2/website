Hi everyone,

Points open correctly to .016 and close completely. New set of points. I
pull the center wire from the distributor and get absolutely no spark.
The spring in the points is strong it hurts to move. I will check that
the distributor shaft is tight and inserted into the gear. I also
checked the condenser it checked out a-Ok. The ground strap in the
distributor looked fine last night but I will see in natural light.

I'll look at these things after breakfast and hopefully get it resolved.
I will report to the list. Thank you for the suggestion Don, I will try
that also if what Arnaud mentions does not work.

Thank you,

Max

are you checking for spark right out of the coil by unplugging the big
wire ? You should see a nice spark there.
Is the spring in the points strong ? i.e. it should hurt if you lift
it with the tip of a nail.

do yourself a favor, remove the distributor cap and make sure the
distributor shaft is tight and well inserted in the gear.
