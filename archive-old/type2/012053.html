&gt; Hi Tom and Dana,

I'll bet your hot idle oil pressure after a
&gt; half hour of 55 mph driving is not very high (5 to 10
&gt; psi).  &gt;

If it drops below about 7psi, you'll start to get the idiot light, right?

If i drop an new engine in properly and i start to get an oil light - at
anypoint during the warranty period -i'd be on the phone immediately.

my .02,
