Alas! You do not have a problem sealing your pedal holes. You are missing a most
elusive part. There is a cover that goes beneath the cab that covers the pedals
and master cylinder. Most original owners or FLARS throw this cover away because
it's too much trouble to put it back on after you work on the master cycinder.

Good luck finding one. I have begged, no, pleaded for someone to sell me one and
either one doesn't exist or no one will let it go (including a rather well known barn 
door owner).
