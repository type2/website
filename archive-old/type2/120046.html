Subject: Re: [T2] painting the tin (color other than black) 

Color doesn't matter much[1], but for what it
is worth the physics of this are that heat is
absorbed and radiated best by darker colors;
it is likewise absorbed and radiated least by
lighter colors.  Physicists refer to &quot;black body
radiation&quot; which is an idealization irrelevant
in the practical world of engine tin.  Nevertheless,
the math[2] for that is:

  Q = e * A * s * ( T^4 - U^4 )

Q: watts of heat transfer
e: emissivity of surface of radiating object
	(&quot;black body&quot; has e=1, 0&lt;e&lt;1)
A: total area of radiating object in meters^2
s: a constant (Stefan-Boltzmann)
T: absolute temperature (K) of the radiating object
U: absolute temperature of space surrounding the radiating object

You may have run into this with insulating glass
for home windows where &quot;Low-E glass&quot; means that the
emissivity of the glass has been reduced by the use
of a coating designed for that purpose.  Emissivities
do vary a lot, hard rubber is .91 while polished
aluminum is .05.  Emissivity is a molecular-level
property of the radiating object's surface.

As to engine cooling, I'd guess that minimizing the
number of times the tin has been painted would be
a good thing, like 1 rather than 5 since there will
be a heat transfer barrier at each coating layer.
Thinking more broadly, solar energy folks do have 
some paints that are &quot;low absorptivity&quot; but
&quot;high emissivity&quot; at the same time; perhaps
some research would find such a paint that also
withstood engine temperatures.[3]  The DoD has done
extensive research in this area on everything from
aircraft heat signatures to soldier's clothing,
but try and get to that...

And, of course, temperature differentials have
the most to do with this, so keeping the enclosing 
space cooler than the engine is what matters.

The 'net being what it is, there is of course an
argument for white engines[4].  Happy hunting.
