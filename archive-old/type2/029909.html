&gt; What tools do i need to for a brake job on my 77 bus?

Common hand tools.

&gt; I want to take my
&gt; rotors to be turned also. Is is possible to do your own front end
&gt; alignment?

Yes.  It can be done with care and ingenuity.

...is it bad to bend brake line to make it fit?

Only if you bend it back and forth several time.
