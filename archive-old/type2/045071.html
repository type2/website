Mike,

I bought a similar tester and had the same problem.  I cured it by buying
a set of tire stem extenders, a length of fuel hose (FI rated, of
course :-), and some hose clamps.  slipped one of the extenders into one
end of the fuel line and clamped it then screwed the schraeder valve onto
it.  The other end slips and clamps onto the port on the fuel ring.  The
extenders are metal and therefore inherently fuel proof.  Be careful that
they are tight, tho!  30psi will pump a *lot* of gas very fast if there is
a leak! (ask me how I know :-)
