&gt;thin sections, most popular for body work.  Gas costs can be high.

I just paid $32.50 to fill my 40 lb tank with a 75/25% CO2 Argon mix.  Is
this about the going rate?

&gt;Flux core and MIG are separate and different processes.
&gt;Apparently one can get a GMAW machine and use FCAW wire in it 
&gt;without the gas shielding. Sounds logical, but recognize the differences.

I think marketing/sales glitz is to blame for this.  Marketers know the MIG
is the desireable outfit for auto hobbyists, so in the catalogs they call
the cheaper flux core welder a &quot;MIG&quot; to lure eager, first time buyers.  The
fine print usually tells you a conversion kit is necessary to make it a MIG
welder.
