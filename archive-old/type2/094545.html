Subject: messy wiring

Hi there!
This is my first time to the list.  I have a huge mess of wires underneath
my steering wheel.  I haven't had my bus for long but I've been putting this
off because I know the headache it's going to be.  Does anyone have any
suggestions on how I should approach this mess?  Thanks
