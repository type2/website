fine and dandy.

finding a quality bolt is going to take a little research and driving
around, but armed with your advice and a sandwich, i am more encouraged
now. that the rivet had some kinda shoulder makes me wonder if i can get
all i need (quality) in a special, shouldered bolt. its a wacky world, and
most our hardware stores sell a lot of junk nuts and bolts. fortunately,
there are a few fastener specialty stores in this fairly large community.
perhaps a drag for others not so lucky.

much appreciated and obliged,
steve
