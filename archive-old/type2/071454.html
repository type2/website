What a day. It turns out that my 1600 dp which I was going to put in Norm(66 
dormobile) to go to the Denver shows next week has a crack under the oil 
cooler mounting ears . Since I don't have the time to build another, nor do I 
have another good case, I'll have to drive the Bauernhofwagen up there next 
week on the as41 case 1300. It's got a weird exhaust that I picked up in NY 
two summers ago which someone made out of a broken Monza exhaust- it's 
missing the muffler, just the left inlet connected to the right tailpipe, and 
vice versa, giving me two separate pipes. Needless to say, it doesn't have a 
whole lot of backpressure. Just to see if it would do anything, I 
sledge-hammered a russet potato into 2 out of the 4 tailpipes. It did quiet 
it down a bit, but the power curve's still practically identical. Anyway, at 
the fineline bug-in, every entrant(show or swap) gets a pass for 1 run down 
the strip- I'm going to go for it! Anyone else out there who's going want to 
run their bus as well?
