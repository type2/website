Hello All,
I am having trouble with my stock 78 passenger bus (2.0 FI).  I 
have searched the archives for 'misfiring', but nothing sounds 
similar.  The bus started losing power, backfiring, and stalling 
at idle.  I took it to a local shop that promised they knew air-
cooled VW's.  This guy had it for about a week and a half, tuned
it up (never knew exactly what that meant, but new disty cap, 
plugs, wires, etc., installed missing vac hoses, yada-yada), 
replaced pushrod-tube seals, and gave it back running fine.  
Drove it to work and on the way home it started running like 
crap again.  Another week and half, I get it back and it runs 
fine for a few days - it starts to sound a little rough and about
a week later the problem's back.  Then I took it to the local VW
dealer who replaced the intake-manifold-tube gaskets and hoses, 
blocked off the EGR line which had rusted away, and two days 
later it's starting to run rough again.

I've set the timing, and I've sprayed WD-40 on each joint to 
check for more leaking.  I can't imagine what the problem could
be that would keep returning after running fine for several hours
to several days.  If you have any guesses or need more details,
please p-mail me.  I will post a summary of responses for anyone
else who might encounter similar problems.

Thanks in advance,
tyler
