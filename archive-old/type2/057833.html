Subject: Generator Bearings Toasted?

  There is a strange bearing noise coming from the Generator and when I
reach around and grab the fan, it moves a little from side to side. I'm
wondering if replacing the bearings is something I can do myself or if
many years of training in a specialized  generator bearing replacement
school is a prerequisite. Also, is it possible to remove the generator
without pulling the engine out of my 68 bus. I've noticed that the fan
housing has a seperate little panel with four bolts attaching it, that
the generator shaft(fan side) passes directly through the center of.
This roundish panel appears as though it may be just large enough for
the generator/fan assembly to be pulled straight out of the fanhousing
if maybe the carb were removed. If the bearings are indeed shot, would
it be cheaper to just buy a new or rebuilt generator or to get mine
rebuilt or to rebuild it myself( I have no diploma from the generator
bearing replacement school). Thanks in advance for your replys!
