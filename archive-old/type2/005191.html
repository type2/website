&gt; Also, I still have no turning signals.
&gt; &gt; The flasher may be bad. Where is the flasher located? Thaks!
&gt;
&gt; It plugs into the bottom of the fuse block.  You have to disconnect the
&gt; battery (to prevent nasty sparks!), unclip the fuse block (the clip is the
&gt; metal tab in front with the rectangular hole) and lift the fuse block.
&gt; The flasher relay is one of the little boxes on the bottom of the block.

Yes, the flasher plugs in the bottom of the fuse box. But....his is a 77.
Starting 73, the fuse box was moved to a very convient area in the middle
section under the dash. I think the move had to do with the relocation of
the turn signal assemblies. When VW put them above the headlights, the 70 to
72 fusebox was right in the way.
