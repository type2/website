Subject: [T2] Bus Poll Results

hey volks,
well ive compiled the results.  i had 84 of you i
belive reply to my little survey.  i really enjoyed
reading all of your descriptions, especially from
those who dont post too often.  always nice to hear a
new voice.  so here are the results:

&quot;A&quot; Condition- 9
&quot;B&quot; condition- 22
&quot;C&quot; condition- 44
&quot;D&quot; condition- 22
(the reason it adds up to more than 84 is because some
people had more than one:)
i know that there isnt a whole lot of intelectual
value in this but it was interesting seeing whos has
what.  thanks again for everyone who particiapted. 
your a great group of people.
 
A)Restored Example

B)Very Nice (not quite restored but very clean or
original nice condition)

C)Daily Driver (clean but has a door ding here and
there or just a touch of rust)

D)Beater (its rusty, dented, combo of both, people
look at you funny when they see its not abandoned-well
maybe not quite that bad:)
