Subject: manifold pressure at startup

Trying to decide if I have a vacuum leak and where the heck it could be.
The bus that first would not let me accelerate without stalling and then
started backfiring now will not start. 

I have checked fuel pressure and that runs 36 lbs.

I have very low manifold pressure when I'm cranking, but quite frankly, I
don't know what it should be when I'm cranking it over. I cannot find a
vacuum leak anywhere and I've checked all the lines 5 or six times. I
replaced nearly every vacuum line in this when I installed the engine. But
what would be expected for manifold/vacuum pressure when cranking?

Thanks! Joe
