Sorry to hear about your engine problems.  I hope the new Mexican long block 
works out.

This may not apply to you, but I just wanted to add a few thoughts on engine 
problems, and my experience.

I have owned my '74 Campmobile for over 10 years.  I had very little air 
cooled experience when I bought it, but I've learned a few things over the 
years.

If you blow an engine, you need to determine what the cause was before you 
dive in and rebuild, or replace it.  Something caused your old engine to go, 
which may be obvious, or may not be.

You are going to transfer the same ignition system, fuel system, exhaust 
system, and cooling system to your new engine.  If any of these could 
possibly be the cause of your old engines demise and left uncorrected, you 
will end up with another blown engine sooner or later.

It's difficult to troubleshoot these systems when you're stranded, but I 
suggest you check everything out fully asap.

I had a friend that blew an engine while on the road.  He lost all of his oil 
and the engine cooked.  He ordered a rebuilt longblock and installed it.  He 
quickly blew the rebuilt motor.  The cause?  A plugged crankcase vent.  
Backpressure in the case blew all of the oil out the seals and around the 
valve covers.

A good investment is an oil pressure and oil temperature gauge.
