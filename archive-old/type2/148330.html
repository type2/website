Subject: Re: [T2] Engine rebuild

Paul at Auto Tech in Redding, CA charges $700, but it's more of a
recondition. He checks the case for need for machine work, changes
bearings, P&amp;C kit, valve job, etc, keeping any good parts that can in
the engine.

 Just wondering how much should I expect to shell out for an engine
 rebuild.  I'm going to start calling places in the Seattle area that
 were recommended to me, but I'd love to hear from list members what
 they were charged for similar work.
