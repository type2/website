Wow dude! What impresses me about this message is that you have quite a long list in your collection. Have you ever heard the song with the words, &quot;you can always tell about the man in the house with a yard full of rusty cars....It then describes him in quite positive terms. The kind of guy I would like to know.
Peace,
Dave
