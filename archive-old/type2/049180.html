&gt; It's coming on at idle all the time.  Like I said, I'm getting a new gauge
&gt; and the relief valve-mounted sender either this or next week, because I'd
&gt; rather not depend on an idiot light alone.  I plan on keeping the light

Ooh, that's not good.  If a new sender doesn't fix it, then it looks like
you have either a very worn engine or bad pressure control valves.
