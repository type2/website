al lo mush!  Hey dude,

Me telling ya  is like the blind leading the blind but I think I can help.  If
you plan on using the seal again on the windshield then I don't know, but if
new one is lined up then do what I've done and get a box or carpet knife and
cut the seal from the glass to the metal, cutting from the windscreen out to
the outside.

removing the engine is a bit more involved!

1st remove the neg. battery cable.  You will need a scissors jack to support
the trans.

Take off the rear apron out.

 With a 7 mm disconnect the accelerator cable! (Forgot that one once)

Disconnect the fuel line at the fuel filter and plug the line with something

Dis attach the wires connect to the Gen., (mark these to aid in replacing)
As well as the wires attached to the coil and oil pressure switch( forgot that
one  last time)

Now your ready with your 17 mm spanner to remove the 4 nuts holding the engine
to trans.  Top two being behind the fan shroud bottom two are from the
opposite direction.

With the 17 mm spanner or more easily with a socket ratchet spanner remove the
cross beam bolts.

With a floor jack raise the engine slightly pull back then lower until the
engine fan shroud can squeeze past the cross beam brackets, and your home
free.

I hope I haven't left anything crucial,  Good luck.

The busma will be with you.
