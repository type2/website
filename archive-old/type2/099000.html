&gt;I had the same problem with my 79 Westy, and found a good solution for it.  
&gt;Over the years, the cheap foam insulation that VW used will dry and turn to 
&gt;dust, leaving no seal around your fresh air flaps.  However, you can make a 
&gt;gasket with silicone.  Here's how:

I removed the front grill and sure enough the foam under the flaps is half missing.  What's left looks like my old engine seal.

I didn't think to look in there for rust, yikes. I bet the flaps were VW black at some point.

&gt;The flaps will compress the silicone, but the plastic will keep it from 
&gt;sticking to the flaps and sealing them forever.  Once the silicone has 
&gt;dried, re-open the flaps and cut holes in the plastic, leaving plastic 
&gt;covering the silicone.  Presto, custom fresh air gaskets!

Thanks Jason.
