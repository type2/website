&gt; Does the assembly just bolt on the
&gt;  door after you get the runner on the body track?  Do I need to replace the
&gt;  whole door?
&gt;  
&gt;  If the U-joint assembly is removable, will all 68 and beyond Type IIs serve
&gt;  as good sources for junk yard replacements?
&gt;  
&gt;  The reason why I'm asking is that I just noticed the limply hanging
&gt;  u-joint and instead of opening the door to look closer, I figured it would
&gt;  be best to wire everything shut until I had a plan of action.
&gt;  
&gt;  Mucho thanx for any suggestions,

Hi NIck (et al),

Yes the rear sliding door hinge is bolted to the door easy to replace. Lots 
in the archives on how to do it.

Yes the hinge is the same on 68 up, panels, kombis and minibuses (except that 
its right/left handed depending on what side the door is on)

yes wire the door up - do it NOW - If the U part of the hinge is detached 
then your door will fall off if you open it!
When you come to do the replacement you will need to support the back of the 
door and its quite heavy

Good luck
