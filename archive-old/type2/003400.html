Subject: leaking oil cooler
Date: Sat, 2 Jun 2001 18:48:22 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I've discovered oil leaking from what appears to be the oil cooler on my '81
westfalia.  I removed the bottom tin and it's not coming from the push rod
tubes or the oil filter.  It seems to emanate from whereabouts the oil
cooler attaches to the engine.  The engine was installed rebuilt in
February.  It only leaks oil when the engine sump oil gets up to 250F and
the engine is running.  Question:  is there a way I could tighten the oil
cooler without removing the engine to try and stop this leaking?  Would a
thicker (lower number = thicker??) oil help?  I have not much time to take
it to the shop as we're leaving on a west coast honeymoon road trip next
Monday.

Thanks in advance!
