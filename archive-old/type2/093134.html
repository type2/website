Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Gas Tank prefilter


&gt;So that was the screen I heard rolling across the bottom of the tank
&gt;when I blew air up the line (gas drained) to see if it was clear?  It's
&gt;been running fine since I did that.  Doesn't the pipe help guard against
&gt;a large piece of crud from sliding over/into the opening and blocking
&gt;the flow to the external filter?

My '65 Beetle stalled on day b/c the pre filter failed. Seems that water 
collects around the base of the wire gauze and rusts AWAY.

Fell off the tube and allowed crud to clog the line. I mistakenly thought 
it was a bum filter or pump.

That was 1 week after driving it from Norfolk, VA to Chattanooga, TN towing 
a Hyundai. Glad that didn't happen during the trip (all night drive).
