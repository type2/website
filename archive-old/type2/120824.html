&gt;&gt; I have been trying to track down a brake noise problem my bus is
&gt;&gt; having ('70 Camper with drum brakes on all four).  As I am driving
&gt;&gt; along and then hit the brakes the first couple of times I hear a
&gt;&gt; grinding/metal on metal noise. After that, no matter how many times I
&gt;&gt; use the brakes the noise is gone.
&gt;....
&gt;&gt; Any ideas on what I should check or look for next?

Personally, I would not worry about it much unless the condition continues
more than a few months.

Your bus probably went through a period when it was not being driven much
dring which time crud found its way into the drum housing and rust built up
on the metal surfaces, springs, etc. What you are hearing  when you first
apply your brakes brake is this crud in contact with the drums. After a few
brake applications the brakes and drums are for the moment wiped clean.

But not all the dirt and rust is gone. More settles as you are parked. So
the process repeats the next time. Gradually, however, most of the crud and
rust will be gone and you won't have the problem any more.

Cheers and happy busing,

Arathorn


P.S. -- Another problem might be that one or more the springs that snug the
shoes against the backing plate is/are weak or broken allowing the show to
&quot;wander&quot; a bit on the drum and venture closer to the edge of the drum that
isn't polished.  But I am assuming that you have already checked your brake
mechanics.
