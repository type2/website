&gt; As a FORMER member of AAAP (American Association
&gt; &gt;of Anvil Producers), I'd just like to say, &quot;Thanks&quot;, for
&gt; &gt;helping to send my job to China... ;-(
&gt; 
&gt; Wasn't the relocation package to you liking? :-)

They sent us two letters:

One was from the PBGC (a taxpayer funded insurer
of &quot;bankrupt&quot; corporations - Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation) saying they'd love to help, but they're
500 Billion in the hole at the moment... ;-(

The other was from the Human Resources Dept. at
the American Association of Anvil Producers saying 
that Wal-Mart (the seventh largest &quot;country&quot; trading
with China) was hiring part time... ;-(

                   GM plant in Mexico... ;-)
