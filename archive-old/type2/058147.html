&gt; &gt;Hi List,
&gt; &gt;Real quick, Will the &quot;BIG&quot; transaxle and 2.0 l eng bolt up to my 72
&gt; &gt;without any mods to shift rods or mounts or anything?  They seem to
&gt; &gt;measure about the same..... Any advice?
&gt; 
&gt; The 091 trans is 1/2 inch longer and the 091 bellhousing is another 1/2&quot;
&gt; longer, for a total of one inch difference.  It will fit, but the front
&gt; trans mount may be a little off.  If you can, use the front mount from the
&gt; original trans.  As another listmember already said, the shift rod will be
&gt; the wrong length - you will probably have to shorten it.
&gt; 
&gt; I put an  091 in my '73 with the '73 bellhousing (1/2 inch total longer)
&gt; and was able to get by without modifying the shift rod - the gearshift was
&gt; just slightly farther back than it was before in each gear.
  
That reminded me... If you use the 79 belhousing the starter is 
different also... so you will need the later starter.
