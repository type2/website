Subject: RE: Cylinder to Head Sealing Rings

The guy at bugformance said these were used to adjust the compression also, but
said that the correct way to do this is to shim up the cylinder, as the spacers
have a tendency to burn out, letting the cylinder to head mating surface leak,
which my old heads do show signs of.  This seems to be a low compression engine,
since it only had about 105 psi max when I purchased it newly rebuilt from ATK
in 1985.  I think I am just going to skip the sealing rings and put it together,
then check the compression.  As long as it is below 130 psi, I'll leave it until
I have a chance to get my replacement engine built.

Thanks,

I was just looking in my VW J.C. Whitney catalog and they had spacers for 
the inbetween the  cylinder and head to reduce engine knock and decrease 
compression.

&gt; 
&gt; In my experience, yes -- I think the rings are actually spacers. I don't
&gt; know if they were used to lower compression or to keep space between valves
&gt; and pistons on heads which have had the faces machined, but when I left
&gt; them out on heads which had them, the valves hit the pistons when I turned
&gt; the motor over slowly.
