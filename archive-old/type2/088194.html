&gt; I've got one of the pre-registrations here in front of me, but it is
pretty
&gt; minimal on info.  It does say the show is from Friday June 21 to Sunday
June
&gt; 23, but says nothing about camping, or camping fees.  Registration is $15
&gt; per car (maybe they don't want busses).  This is sponsored by
Anheuser-Busch
&gt; and will be at their plant.  It is called the Bud Bug Classic 2002.
&gt;
&gt; There is a contact email, maybe you'd better have a talk with him:
&gt;
&gt; albugsme_at_frii_dot_com or 970.493.1300
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I hear there is a vw show in Ft Collins Colorado on the 22nd of this
month.
&gt; &gt; To be held at the Budweiser brewery.  Does anyone have any info?  How is
&gt; &gt; camping with extreme fire warnings in Colorado?  any response is
appreciated?
