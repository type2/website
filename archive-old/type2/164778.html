Subject: Re: [T2] finding TDC

Paul asked:

You say &quot;just as the exhaust closes, the intake will start to open&quot;.
 On my bus, when I do this, there's a few degrees of both of them
closed.  Not many, maybe 5* at most (less than an inch on the fan
pulley).  Does this mean my camshaft is rounding or am I 180* off base?
 I've heard others say the same thing as you just described, and I
hadn't really thought much about it.... until now.

You should not have any 'dead' space between the rocking of the valves.  Are you confusing this with valve
overlap? Valve overlap is the duration when both valves are open.
