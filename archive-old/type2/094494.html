&gt;List,
&gt;All of this talk about wiring and fuses reminded me of
&gt;something I saw in Muir that I could not locate or
&gt;understand.  I thought I had a problem with the
&gt;ignition switch on my '72, but it turned out to be a
&gt;loose battery ground wire...check the obvious stuff
&gt;first. I was going to go through the check for the
&gt;ignition switch, Muir said to locate fuse #15 and
&gt;check/replace.  I could not find fuse #15, could
&gt;someone steer me in the right direction for future
&gt;reference.
