Subject: Re: [T2] Convert walkthrough to a bench seat?

Hi Volks!

&gt; &gt; Is it possible to install a bench in the front of my 73?

&gt; Curious to say, I have a 72 with a bench. I saw a walkthrough with the same
&gt; bench as mine at the Lakeport show. The owner swore it came that way
&gt; originally.

Can be.  While partition and walkthrough are different body styles,
both came with the respective other seat arrangement optionally.
Walkthrough with a bench seat (no walkthrough as such, but a walkthrough
body), and partition with a single passenger seat.  The latter even
does make sense (somewhat): it allows you to have the spare wheel in
the cab and retain the single passenger seat, and in panel vans a
partition may make sense regardless of number of seats anyway.

I don't know if pick-ups got that option too, but I assume they did.

I've even seen one &quot;partition walkthough&quot; panel, a '73 fire engine, 
but sadly didn't photograph it.  The &quot;walkthrough bench&quot; version I 
have never laid my eyes on yet.  Doesn't make a lot of sense, though, 
which is why I expect they're awfully rare.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
