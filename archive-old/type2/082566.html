Subject: Re: [T2] 72-79 Pressure Plate bolts

I believe unless stated otherwise. it's assumed to be course threads.
Which should be what you said M8 dia x 1.25 thread pitch x 20mm long.

but do yourself a favor &amp; make sure you get the correct bolts. These
have those &quot;teeth&quot; on the underside of the head which should dig in
and help make them lock into place into the washer. I can imagine it
would be very bad to have one of those babies back out :(

&gt; Quick simple-ish question here that I really need to know quickly:
&gt; 
&gt; What is the size of the pressure plate bolts on the 72-79 flywheel?  The
&gt; Bentley claims M8x20, but that size is not in a format I recognize.  Usually
&gt; it is something like M8 diameter x 1.25 thread x 20mm long.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help is greatly appreciated... Trying to get a '74 Westi engine in and
&gt; to Edisto Freeze Yer Toe by midnight tonight :)  I have a side bet with Dave
&gt; Easterwood for a 6-pack of Guinness that this bus will get there, and I hate
&gt; to loose bets!
