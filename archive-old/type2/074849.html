Subject: RE: [T2]  Westy Interior Panel Patterns

Get me the measurements and I will have the time (should take a couple 
evenings) to get the drawings made up and the dimensions added in.

I can then (I think) send them out in .pdf or .dwg or .bmp or whatever to 
whoever wants them.

This is 2-D work, it's the 3-D that kills me...

I have a fast university Internet connection so it would be easy to send 
out any big files or pass them through file transfer on ICQ.

By the way - got a &quot;B&quot; in my CAD course this semester (in my mind). The 
instructor gave me a &quot;C&quot;.

I got a 79.86 and he does not round up. He says a 79.99 is still a &quot;C&quot;.... 
Grumble, grumble, grumble...

Had a presentation to do and my classmates loved it (10 hours work) but he 
still gave me a &quot;C&quot; on it... .... grumble, grumble, grumble.

Done complaining... Still got Advanced AutoCAD to go next semester and a 
CNC course under him too. Damn!

&gt;Re: the 78 Westy patterns - I would not count on them being the same as
&gt;those of earlier years.  I think, for this project to remain valid, we all
&gt;need to keep track of what year Westy we are taking our measurements from,
&gt;and strive to keep all patterns from like years together and separate from
&gt;those of other years. As we go, we will probably discover that certain years
&gt;are similar or identical.
&gt;
&gt;For example, I would expect to find that 68 - 72 will all be identical, due
&gt;to other known similarities between those years.  But right now, I have no
&gt;way to prove that.
&gt;
&gt;I imagine that later year Westy's will also fall into groups of some sort,
&gt;but I don't know enough about them to have any clue how that will turn out.
&gt;
&gt;I propose we move ahead with this one step at a time.  The whole thing
&gt;started with a question about certain panels in a 71 Westy, IIRC, so let's
&gt;focus on the 71 Westy first and try to address the original poster's
&gt;question, then move on the the larger picture.
&gt;
&gt;I agree, having this info available - all panels for all years - for
&gt;download, would be a great thing.

&gt;
&gt;Save it in 2000, it can be opened and re-saved in any format.
&gt;
&gt;Or I can manipulate it into a few different formats if you send me the .dwg
&gt;files.
&gt;
&gt;Also with the university Internet connection I have I can re-send this out
&gt;to anyone that asks with your approval very easily.
&gt;
&gt;I just took an AutoCAD course this semester. I am working towards an
&gt;engineering degree while I work as Library staff. In fact i am waiting for
&gt;my final grades to be posted right now - it's making me very old!!!
&gt;
&gt;See ya.

&gt;
&gt;P.S. I might be able to get good measurements from my headliner, sliding
&gt;door, and door panels this weekend and post the .dwg files Monday. This is
&gt;will be for a '78 Westy. Would that be the same as ane arly baywindow?

&gt; &gt;How about this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'll generate a basic AutoCad .dwg for the sliding door panel, as I think
&gt; &gt;that would be the easiest/best way to get all of the necessary dimensions
&gt;to
&gt; &gt;you.   I'm no AutoCad expert, but I do use it in my work and know enough to
&gt; &gt;be dangerous.  What version - 2000, 14, 13....?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I can plot it full size and check against my bus to be sure it fits.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If you don't get any offers on the other panels I could check mine as best
&gt;I
&gt; &gt;can without taking stuff apart to seriously.

&gt; &gt;Actually I would be glad to make a full size (24&quot; X 36&quot;) set of blueprints
&gt; &gt;for all the 68-72 Westy interior birch panels for the VW community and even
&gt; &gt;the door panels and the kick panels too. I have most of the original pieces
&gt; &gt;and could make the prints on AutoCad, but I need 2 things:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1) dimensions for the headliner, which I believe should be fabricated in 3
&gt; &gt;pieces. I also would need the dimensions for the driver's side panels. Russ
&gt; &gt;it would save me time if you could take some dimensions for the sliding
&gt; &gt;door. I have the rear deck lid panel and the trim pieces in the rear around
&gt; &gt;the spare tire.
&gt; &gt;http://www.72camper_dot_com/wood06.jpg
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2) somebody to check the dimensions by actually using the blueprints before
&gt; &gt;making them available to the public.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Anybody have those dimensions? A good way to check the dimensions is for
&gt; &gt;somebody to measure theirs against mine too.
