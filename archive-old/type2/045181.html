Subject: [T2] Volkswagen, what are you trying to do?

What is up with VW?  They're gonna be selling a Jetta station wagon
here in the states and with a 2L!  Instead of the 1.8T that everyone
wants.  Their Eurovan is a gas guzzler when compared to other vans. 
And the worst thing is this Eurovan does not have manual transmission,
with only one engine option.  They don't even have a no frills car be
it a golf or a new beetle to be no frills or whatever.  Honestly I
wouldn't mind a Eurovan, but as long as manual is unavailable...   I'd
never be caught dead driving an automatic (unless it wassn't my car). 
And why oh why did they discontinue the Vanagon?  It looks like the
Eurovan is even smaller.  The NB is too close to the ground.  Both the
NB and the Eurovan don't have the syncro.  Oh gosh, if you have seen
their futur passat you would know what I'm talking about.  Honestly
the new Passat looks alright but the tail lights are terrible.  They
made the tail lights look like the car is a d*mn rice burner.
Overall I think VW is doing a good job and their NB is a big hit. 
Just my 2 cents

Matt
