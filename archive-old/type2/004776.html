Christopher sez:

&gt; I saw a bus some time ago with the spare tire mounted on the nose, nothing
&gt; new. But he had it set up like a regular tire, with the little chrome
hubcap
&gt; in the center. The rim was painted nicely the color of the bus as the rest
&gt; had been.
&gt; My spare tire I don't think ever could hold the cap because of its
&gt; shape/difference from the stock rims, but even if I had a extra stock
&gt; rim/tire combo instead would those bolts coming from the tire mount stick
&gt; out so far you couldn't get the centercap on, or if that going to be the
&gt; easy solution - simply pick up a stock rim from a junk yard and use that
for
&gt; my spare after I paint it to match my current rims?
&gt;
&gt; Im guessing its more involved than this, but if anyone knows better???
that
&gt; would make my day.

If you mount the spare tire in the reversed position * that is with the
inside of the wheel facing forward* you can place one of the larger *full
wheel* hub caps in the center, and it will be held in place by it's own
outer ring of clips.
