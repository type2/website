Subject: GOOD valve cover gaskets?

Hi everyone.

Well, yesterday I had my first experience with the dreaded 
crappy-ass valve cover gaskets (T1)  One blew on my way to work
so I had to drive with my windows open to ward off asphyxiation
.  My friend brought me another set, which turned out to be 
worse than the original gasket. (BTW-- The 1st ones had only
been on the bus for 4 weeks)   I had to stop 3 times on the 
way home to clear the smoke out of the bus and re-fill with oil
.  I put another on last night, even glued it to the valve 
cover with permatex (cured, let to dry, etc.) I did it like I 
always did on my bug (never leaked).  Only difference is, on 
the bug, I used the ultra-thick black rubber-impregnated cork
gaskets.  My source for those has dried up, so I have been 
forced to buy the cheap cork things.

My question... Anybody got a source for the GOOD T1 valve cover
gaskets?!?!?  I'm willing to mail order.  Also, does anyone
even know what I'm talking about?

TIA,
