Subject: cops were here, bus has got 2 weeks

hey all,
well the cops were here a few minutes ago.  the 70 has gotta go within 2 
weeks, or else.  price may have just gone down.  this is the 70 deluxe 
turned westy located in southern wisconsin.  i'm asking $400, which might be 
becoming quite negotiable.
