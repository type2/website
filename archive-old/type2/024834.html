Subject: starts, but wont start...
Message-ID: &lt;928e5b8.2529851c_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello all...
  After spendinging the day in my garage, i got my engine together and in my 
bus. I started the morning putting my new piston rings on, and took the 
following 12 hours or so doing the rest. 
  I seem to be having a starting problem. I have checked all my connections, 
tested fuel pressure, spark and so on...  What is happening is when i turn 
the key, it fires, but dies right out. It seemes  that the only fuel that its 
getting is from the cold start valve. So I pulled off the left injector rack, 
and there in no fuel being fired. I put it back on, and checked pressure. 
Plenty of it. Next i grabbed my test light and hooked it up to the harness 
plug, one end to pos., the other to neg.  I have done this test before and 
found the light to dimly pulsate. this time i got nothing.
  It seems that my injectors are not getting their signal to fire. I emptied 
my sleeves of all the tricks i hide up there, but nothing seemed to help. I 
guess i still have a few more things i want to test, but it's way late, and 
i'm done for the day. 
  I'm just thinkin out any possibilities, and wondering if anybody else has 
had any similar experiences, or suggestions to throw out.

  thanks Matt
