Subject: Can't get it off!

Okay so lastnight I was replacing the breather lines for the fuel tank and 
wanted to take care of a little surface rust in the tank compartment. I will 
not see this area for a while. POR-15 on hand, I decided to give it a try. 
As I was opening it, before I put on gloves...DOH! I spilled it on my hands. 
How the hell do you get this stuff off. Gasoline, kerosene, acetone nothing 
has worked yet. I do believe this is some strong stuff. Any suggestions 
would be great.

On a lighter note, my fingers will not be rusting anytime soon =D.
