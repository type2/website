&gt; &gt; a side question here, My van came with the &quot;Deluxe&quot; torsion bars, but the

&gt; 
&gt; Just make sure that the left bar goes on the left and the right bar goes
&gt; on the right.  Torsion bars don't like to work backwards once they take a
&gt; set.

well one is stamped &quot;L&quot; and the other is stamped &quot;R&quot; so I guess that means
the obvious, even in German
