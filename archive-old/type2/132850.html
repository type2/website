Subject: Re: [T2] '70 camper available for parts in santa cruz

If it was parked at home he should check his homeowners insurance -- or
that of the owner of the building on the lot where the tree was located.
Whoever owns the tree is responsible for any damage it does when falling
and it falls under insurance on the property, not auto insurance.

&gt; I feel for this person. I also feel for the fact that I can't pay towing
&gt; for that great a distance to my place, or I would snatch it. Damn.
