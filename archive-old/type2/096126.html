Subject: Re: [T2] Re: sudden exhaust noise.


well it was too good to last, hadn't had any trouble for months.

this morning as I accelerated off an exit ramp onto the interstate there
was a &quot;PSSHHWHAP&quot; for lack of a better description,  immediately pulled to
shoulder and shut it off.   AAA brought me home....

.  ran a little warm yesterday 5-10degrees not much thought maybe oil was
low
.  no apparant loss of power
.  cranks normally no sounds from engine
.  starts and runs normally, just LOUD!
.  so far quick look don't see anything loose or missing.

.....
my ideas so far

.  pulled exhaust stud (or 2)
.  stuck open valve??
.  pulled head studs?
.  ?????

just came in to change clothes and go look at it, not going to work today.
any ideas of what else to look for????

THanks
Bob
