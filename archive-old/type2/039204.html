&gt;Can I swap a set of '76 front doors into a '78??&gt;
&gt;The '76 has the hex insert nut version, and the '78 has the bolt head nut.

 Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings but no,they aint interchangable.
 The spacings between the two holes on the hinge that bolts to the 
 A-pillar is different and whilst the door hinge on the '76 (&amp; earlier)
 sits in front of the locating tab on the pillar (as you mount the door,
 not as in the front of the bus)the '77-'79 ones fit in behind the A-pillar
 locating thingy.It's also not really practical to try and remove the 
 entire hinge mechanism from the door 'cos you can't get to it inside
 the door (if you were thinking of swapping the entire hinge)
 Been there,tried that... 

 No doubt there's someone out there who has managed to do it with a
 bit of butchering &amp; welding but the doors could not be removed,
 or re-positioned for best fit if you did that.Not recommended.

&gt;
&gt;How about the sliding door??  Will that swap out easily??

 Haven't ever done that,but I'm sure it is far easier to achieve than
 the front door swap.I'm not aware of the sliding door mechanisms
 changing at the same time as the fr.door hinges but I'll bow to
 someone with greater knowlege on that one...

&gt;(I finally found a clean sage green donor.  Finally!!!)
