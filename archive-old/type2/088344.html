Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Pop Top Fiasco

Here we go with Bus Depot again :0)

Its been a sore/shining topic for a lot of people.

Generally: they take a while longer to ship some things, and sometimes screw
things up.

However they are usually quite a bit cheaper!!

I would rather not see the long flames/praise for Bus Depot all night and
day again. Check the archives.

Good luck though!!
