Ok kids, we're getting close to the next leg, but we have some gaps that, if
filled, will make the baton passing easier.

Specifically, we'd like to see some folks in the Richmond, VA area. We need
to get the baton this direction, and have no drivers currently signed up for
this area. The driving would likely be this weekend, so you'd need to be
available.

Thanks!
