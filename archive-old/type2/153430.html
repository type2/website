Subject: Re: [T2] 72 pushrod tubes

Hello,

Phil Cain's idea should work and he knows what he is talking about.

But what I do is get a set of the big pliers, the kind that you can adjust 
my moving one of the arms. It's great if you have an extra pair that you can 
dedicate to this task. You are going to wrap the teeth of the pliers around 
and around with duct tape or electrical tape. It will make the teeth of the 
pliers fatter so you have to adjust it out more to go around the outside of 
the tube. Now take one of those red shop rags and wrap it around the tube. 
Take your cushioned pliers and GENTLY squeeze the tube. The tubes are soft 
and will collapse if you are not careful. Really just a little pressure. The 
trick is to turn it, not pull it out. They generally stick in there and once 
you free them, by spinning them around, they should just pull right out by 
hand (take the pliers away when pulling them out, unless you really need 
them).

Good luck,

Rob Henley
