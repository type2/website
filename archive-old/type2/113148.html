Subject: Re: [T2] Carb replacement

&gt;I am now ready to replace the carb setup that I have on my 73 westy. I
&gt;currently have a Weber progressive single carb and I think that I want to go
&gt;back to the dual setup. I need advice from anyone out there that has changed
&gt;their stock duals for an aftermarket brand. What size do I need, what brand
&gt;is best, what am I going to have to do to get new ones tuned, do I need to
&gt;order extra jets to tune it or do they come with them, etc? Any help the
&gt;list can provide is would be greatly appreciate since this is a good sized
&gt;investment.

http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/ has Solex 34PDSIT carbs in stock (Brosol, 
Brazil New Carbs) I have yet to install mine but when I get it done I'll 
try to detail it. The only major disadvantage I can see is that I can 
no-longer use the oil-bath air-cleaner because they require a 
modification to the linkage (apparently a better angle and causes less 
wear to the throttle-shaft bushings.

&gt;I am also looking for good info on performance of the different setups. I
&gt;have a 1700 cc engine with a distributor that currently has an vacuum
&gt;advance and retard setup, but only the advance is being used. The
&gt;progressive runs well, but will not work well in the winter and I have a
&gt;hesitation when I first start to accelerate. I thought about getting a carb
&gt;heater from Jake Raby, but figured that the dual setup would be better in
&gt;the long run.
&gt;  
&gt;
The stock carb setup sits low enough to the engine so that icing isn't a 
problem. I once had an 1800 in a bug with the weber progressive and 
icing was always an issue. BTW when I do remove my original carbs I'll 
put them up for sale to anyone interested. They're in great shape save 
the throttle-shaft wear.
