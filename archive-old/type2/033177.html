&gt; Running a low octane fuel will increase engine temps, all

In the absence of detonation, I don't see how this can be.  Low octane
fuels have the same heat value as high octane fuels.  The only
difference is that high octane fuels have a lower flame front
propagation speed, which reduces their tendancy to auto-ignite (knock).

The FTP reference you cite makes no connection between octane and
operating temperature.

&gt; I've posted on this before. How many on the list complain
&gt; that their engine runs hot, even with everything timed and
&gt; set perfectly. I'll bet you they run cheap fuel. Others on
&gt; the list have posted that they note lower engine temps with
&gt; higher octane.

Fuel specifications are set by the government.  Various vendors may
have their own minor additive packages, but the basic octane and
formulation of the fuel is set by government regulation, which is why
we're stuck with oxygenated fuel.  The oil companies aren't going to
spend money when they don't have to.

Fuel at less expensive stations comes from the same refineries as that
at more expensive stations.  It is refined with the same equipment,
tranported via the same pipelines, hauled in the same type of truck,
etc.  The only difference is that the expensive stations are somewhat
prettier and advertise more. 
 
&gt; Run what you want. I just like to see facts rather then
&gt; opinion. I think MIT (the people that approved the FTP site)
&gt; can be relied upon for the facts.

This site is hosted by MIT, but I doubt that they have &quot;approved&quot; (or,
for that matter, &quot;disapproved&quot;) it. 

The info in this FAQ seems to be pretty straight, but there is some
water-as-fuel stuff in part 4 that borders on the crackpot.  Also, be
aware that much of the data in the FAQ applies to engines that have
knock-sensing management systems, which our buses do not.

&gt; What George posted is correct, if your engine does not
&gt; knock, and does not run hot, then there is no difference
&gt; between 87 and 91 octane fuel. If your otherwise sound
&gt; engine is running hot with 87, try 91 and see what happens.

That wasn't quite what I posted.  What I said was that ping was the
only reason to go to a higher octane fuel.

I fear that this is a topic that has to be checked by experiment.  To
do it right, you need an accurate cylinder head temperature guage and a
way of switching fuels on the fly.  Comparing a tank of low versus a
tank of high octane fuel allows too many other variables to change to
get an accurate evaluation of the effect of octane.

To _really_ do it right, the engine should be in a test cell with an
engine brake, but I'm not prepared to go to those lengths.  (Bob
Hoover, are you lurking?)
