Marty,
Here's my take on H2O Vanagon vs airsucker bus.  I like the 68-71 bus for
the following reasons.  The baywindow may not have the personality of a
splittie, but it is soooo much better a road vehicle in the real world.(No
flames please).  The type 1 type type 2 is simpler to tune, single carb vs
dual or FI, less emission controls to keep going(unless you're in CA),
easier engine to pull, cheaper to repair.  If you don't really mind dealing
with FI, computers, complicated engines, and hoses hoses hoses, get heat,
AC, and all the bells and whistles, get a shiny waterpumper bus.(Yes, I
maintain its still a bus, so sue me). My humble opinion.
