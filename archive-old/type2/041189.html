Subject: alternator warning lite help

How can I bypass the dash wiring and create a new alternator warning lite? I 
have inherited a wiring mess and need to at least get this particular circuit 
working!

Is it as simple as connecting a wire 

from:
the alternator's blue D+ wire that goes to the existing non-functional 
warning circuit

to:
a lamp or the + side of a diode and grounding the other side of the lamp or 
-side of the diode?

thanks
