&gt; 1954 Ambulance bus. #20-072014. Very nice canidate for restoration or
&gt;    daily driver. Very little rust. Rust free nice original dog legs. 

&gt;etc etc

Yep,

Mark Merz was the man with the $10000 61 23 window (pretty clean but
unrestored - looks like he must have sold it though I haven't seen it
advertised for a while)......

Given his top-of-the range asking prices I wouldn't  expect a lot of ambulance
for $5000.
