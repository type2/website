Subject: black wire on Alternator harness goes where?

Hi Volks,

I just reinstalled the 2L engine back in the westfakia and its 55A  
alternator wiring harness has a thin black wire that I can't seem to  
match up with any unused connectors.  The bus seems to run OK without  
it connected and the alt light is not coming on.

Anyone got an idea what that wire connects to?

The bus has been offline since the second week of October, today I  
finally got it off the ramps under its own power. It sure felt good!

Thanks,


Happy Trails,
