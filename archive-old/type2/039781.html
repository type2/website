Subject: Re: Tool question

WRT socket set, I would get cheap Chinese crap because (for cheap Chinese
crap) it is surprisingly good nowadays (fears of people stripping sockets
are much exaggerated I think). Then I would get decent 6-point sockets in
10, 13 and 17 mm sizes, and I'd get a VERY good ratchet. This will CYA for
a long time, lot of miles, not much money.

Here is a surprising thing: at my old company we had several sets of tools
sold under the Goodwrench brand name and they had the GM logo on them (you
remember the ridiculous Mister Goodwrench ad campaign by which General
Motors embarrased themselves a few years ago). They were ==superb== tools,
beautifully finished, nicely balanced, stood up to constant abuse by
lamers. I don't know where they came from or if they are still available
but they could hold their own against Snap-Ons and if I had to get all new
tools I would look for them.
