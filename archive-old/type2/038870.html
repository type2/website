I have a 71 bus and I was wondering if there's anyway that a relay could be tied
into the key buzzer circuit to act as an accessory power source? Although I've
pulled my relay to get rid of that horrible buzzing sound when the door is open
and the keys are in, it seems that if the key being in the ignition makes a
contact that can power the buzzer, you could trip a relay with it at the same
time and power your stereo. Take out the key, kill the power. Sounds good in
theory but I have no idea how the buzzer circuit is set up or how it ties into
the door switch. Still, seems like some potential for  creative engineering..
Any thoughts?
