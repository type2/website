Subject: N.O.S. Parts

        It is believed that Volkswagen set the standard for quality and
precision both in the production of their cars and spare parts. However
most would agree that when restoring a vintage Volkswagen the most
difficult step is finding the best, most original part. Often times we must
settle for inferior reproductions thus reducing the authenticity of that
sad little air-cooled VW. Don't you love just spending hours modifying a
re-chromed/&quot;restored&quot; vent wing to get it to fit? Well, we can't stand it,
so we decided to hunt down original, German, N.O.S. parts, most commonly
used in restorations; thus forming our company. However, most original part
sources have dried up increasing their allure and value. Now after roughly
8 years of searching we have the parts/resources to offer to the public. We
discovered steering wheels in South Africa, coco mats in Kenya, electrical
items in Hong Kong/China, early motor parts in Alaska, interior pieces in
Spain, Holland, and Austria, brake parts in Germany and America; just to
name a few.

       True, there are many items not worth replacing N.O.S., such as some
rubber, screws, stick shifts, sheet metal, the wire mesh filters for 25
horse power cylinder vent holes, but we have them anyway. So you stripped
your car, you made a list of what you need, now give N.O.S. a call. We may
have everything you want that you thought you'd never find - only New Old
Stock, the only parts we carry!

N.O.S. - German Volkswagen parts, never used, often in un-opened, original
factory packaging thus ensuring optimum quality, fit, and authenticity.

Here is a list of some of the most popular parts we carry. Please call for
availability of other parts not on this list!
