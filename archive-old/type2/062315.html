Subject: Stickers and Cops (f)

        Got pulled over for weaving in and out of my lane by the local 
police.  I had spent the previous two hours removing the multitude of 
stickers from the inside and outside of my bus with laquer thinner.   
Guess I should've rolled down the windows before I went for a drive.   
The policeman was quite nice and let me go. (because I had no 
incriminating stickers on my bus? :)
