Subject: Choike Heater

Is it feasible to repair a defective choke heater element. For the life I me
I can't find nay a one in this town... and a detest having to send away for
one...

Is it worth the trouble to repair a possible broken wire/connection or give
it up and go  for mail order?

What would be a reasonable price to expect to pay?
VW out here can order one for ...$100.. &lt;==yeah right if I'll pay that
BowWow has a similar one but only fits Beetle's.. for about $30.00

Do the bus ones usually cost about the same as a Beetle?

Brian
