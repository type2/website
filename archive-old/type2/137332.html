&gt;This is a dealer part. But dealers' parts counters tend not to have

&gt;very worst case. If they are 2 mm, I'm in a bit of trouble. Maybe I'll 
&gt;have to grind a hundredth of an inch or so off my old one and stack it 
&gt;with the 2 mm. Insisting on meeting specs is a PITA!

This one?

&gt;Meanwhile, no one has Permatex 3H. I have Gasgacinch on hand. If anyone 
&gt;thinks it's a poor choice to seal my case, yell now. NAPA has aviation 
&gt;gasket sealer, and it's Permatex, but it's not numbered 3H.

Is it brownish?

&gt;While I was hunting for it, though, I saw a product at Pep Boys called 
&gt;&quot;Low Odor Aircraft Remover.&quot; So if I want to remove an aircraft from my 
&gt;bus without making too much of a stink, I can.

If it doesn't have Methylene Chloride as the main ingredient skip it. If it does be careful not to breath any or let it touch your body.
