&gt; You should be sure to turn your wheels and let the bus roll and rest the
front wheels against the curb.
&gt; Facing up hill cut your wheels to the left and facing down hill cut your
wheels to the right.

With the international nature of the list, it might be better to state to
turn your front wheels toward/away &quot;from the curb&quot;, rather than to the left
or right.  And it can make a big difference if there's not a curb.

I got this from a Driver Education publication:

&quot;Just in case your parking brake fails, you should always turn the front
wheels of your vehicle so that it will not roll into the traffic lane.  The
way you should turn your wheels depends on whether you are parked facing
uphill or downhill and whether or not there is a curb.

If you are parking facing downhill, you should always turn your front wheels
towards the curb or side of the road.

If you are parking facing uphill and there is a curb, you should turn your
front wheels towards the middle of the road and allow the vehicle to roll
back against the curb. If you are parking facing uphill and [there] is not a
curb, you should turn your [front] wheels toward the side of the road.&quot;

The bit about making sure that your front tires actually rest against the
curb is important.  If a gap is left between the front tires and the curb
when parking, some vehicles will actually climb the curb if the brake fails.
