Subject: Dual-battery stuff (long)
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Volks:

There's been a lot of posts recently about
dual-battery systems.  This always seems to come up
and normally the correct info gets posted.  I can't
remember reading this anywhere in the recent threads
but if it was posted I apologize.

Anyway, for proper charging with a dual-battery
isolator you need to have an isolator with an 'R'
terminal.  Normally you have a voltage drop across the
isolator around .5-1V.  This doesn't allow for
complete charging of the aux battery.  The R on the
proper isolator stands for remote regulator sensing. 
You connect the R terminal to the.  The alternator
senses the voltage drop and increases its output so
you get proper charging.  See this PDF for an
installation diagram.  Look under group 3 which is
page 4 of the PDF.  ---&gt;

&lt;---

I know that VW used a relay for dual-battery charging
but I'm going to take a guess and assume it was for
cost reasons, not performance reasons.  Relays are
cheap, isolators aren't.  I'm not an EE so I won't
pretend that I know all the pros and cons.

So what do I have in my bus?  Heh-heh, nothing at the
moment because my main battery died and my deep-cycle
battery is now my primary battery.  I did have an
isolator but I didn't have the correct one so I went
back to the original relay.  I will eventually get
another battery and the proper isolator...  I had run
a 4 ga cable from the aux battery up through the
original Westy hole in the spare tire well to a power
distribution block hidden in the fridge compartment. 
That distribution block powers the fridge and a power
amp also hidden in the fridge compartment.  There is a
wire running from that block to another power
distribution block hidden behind the washer fluid
reservoir.  That distribution block powers the
interior lights, driving lights and stereo and I'm
planning on running the headlights from that as well. 
I'll use the original headlight wires as relay
triggers.  Since the aux battery is now the primary I
moved the 4 ga wire over so everything still works.
