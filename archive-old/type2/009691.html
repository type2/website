&gt;My stick shift in the 73 Westy has always been a little difficult to = find 1st
gear and downshifting into 2nd. Driving to work i was looking at the shift
pattern placard on the ash = tray and noticed that the H is at a backwards 
slant. Tried to shift in this pattern and all seems smooth as silk. Obviously 
the bus was engineered to shift this way but having driven = other makes of 
standard cars the slanted H feels weird. Can anyone elaborate on this? &lt;

I agree. I was trying to drive my bus like a normal stick car for months, before
I realized that you really DO have to shift a bit side-ways. That made a huge
difference in driving it and I felt like a complete bonehead when I figured it
out. Synthetic 80W90 made it shift even nicer..
