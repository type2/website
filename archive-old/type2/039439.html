Anomalies happen. Eye/light tech before guessing is called for to save
time/money. For any electrical glitch, some quick investigation at the
battery, the item/s malfunctioning, the fuze box and underdash might take 5
or 10 minutes and will catch obvious flaws.  Some initial data, other than
symptons, is required before any real diagnosis can commence. Symptoms give
you an idea where to start looking. A quick search for open and notorious
flaws will reduce efforts at unnecessary speculation, again, saving
time/money.
