4 Amps sound about right. Each turn signal bulb is 21W, two of them  
(front and rear) account for 42W - at 12V this results in a 3.5 A  
current.

&gt; Hi Jon,
&gt;
&gt; I agree on the possible wiring issue, but shouldn't at least one  
&gt; side turn
&gt; signal work then? Turn signals on both sides drew about ~4amps when  
&gt; turned on.
&gt; I had removed the fuse and placed my meter in place of the fuse.  
&gt; Seemed a bit
&gt; high. Any one know what is normal or any other thoughts?
&gt;
&gt; Please forward any info you might have.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again
&gt;
&gt; Ray
