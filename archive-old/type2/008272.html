Subject: recent purchase of a 74 westy 64k orig mi
Date: Wed, 10 Feb 1999 01:06:12 -0500

Hello fellow type 2 owners. Ijust purchased a 74 westy from the east coast
in suprisingly excellent
condition(the body no rustat all). It has the orig. 1800cc dual setup. I
put a battery in it and it started right up! Until i tried to move it. When
moving it would stall the engine wouldnt get out of its own way. I then
started to tune it up with my trusty &quot;Idiot Guide&quot;. Sorry to bore you with
all of this and to make a long story short when i pulled the 1&amp;2 plugs
BLACK the 3&amp;4 gas fouled can anyone give me some input and all the
knowledge that teey are willing to spare for a new VW man .
 this 22yo ex marine would appreciate it!
     SEMPER FI VW
