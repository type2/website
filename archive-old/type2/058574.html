If you're really picky about this, cut the bolts to fit the depth of
the holes.  That way, the next time you take it apart you don't have
to worry about keeping that stack of washers intact.  It also makes
for a slightly more stable attachment.  Be sure to deburr the end of
the cut bolt so it won't ruin the new case threads.
