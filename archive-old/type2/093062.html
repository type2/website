Subject: Re: [T2] ignition switch question

The few VW ignition switches I worked on had a lock with a nylon portion 
fastened to the end of it. There were tiny nylon buttons that turning the 
key would push. Maybe that nylon portion is not fitting correctly or it 
needs to be pushed on further. Sounds like the buttons are not getting 
pushed far enough in.

&gt;I replaced the electrical portion of my ignition switch tuesday because it 
&gt;was getting harder and harder to start.  You'd have to turn the key with 
&gt;full force, almost breaking it to get it to crank.  Finally it just gave 
&gt;up.  With the new switch in, now it will only crank if you push the key in 
&gt;toward the steering column while cranking it.  What gives??  It's as if 
&gt;the lock portion is now worn, although the lock that's in there is a 
&gt;replacement one...(don't know how long it's been there).  Does anyone have 
&gt;any thoughts as to how to rectify this?  tia, Greg
