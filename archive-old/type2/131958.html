Subject: Toolkit for bus pickup trip.

Hi Volks,

Remember that thread a couple weeks ago about long-distance bus buying? 
Here we go again.

My dad has been commissioned to bring home a splitty for a local bay 
owner. It's on the west coast. It's clean and in good running 
condition, and includes the original engine and tranny as spares.... 
they have been replaced with a NEW 1700cc upright and a freeway flier 
tranny. Mom and Dad plan to fly out west and drive it 2600 miles back 
to Toronto.

So let's get to the point: What would you pack in your toolbox if it 
were YOU making this trip???

(Don't say cash, we already know that one.)

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
