&gt;She now runs ...with too fast an idle and
&gt;waaaaay too rich.

I'm having the same problem with my FI, and after pouring over Bentley 
and testing just about everything else, I'm pretty sure that it's the 
Cold Start valve, which is essentially a 5th inject that should only work 
for about 8 seconds.  The tell-tale symptom in my mind is the fact that 
if it stalls while warm, I cannot get it started again without letting it 
sit for 5 minutes.  Another symptom I have in addition to rich and high 
idle is poor gas milage (around 13 mpg).  The other common mistake 
Bentley identifies for these symptoms is switiching wires 30 and 50 (they 
hook to the solenoid and starter).  I haven't check that either.  I'll 
let you know what I find with the cold start valve - I've been holding 
off because the bottom screw is almost impossible to get to without 
pulling the distributor, and I don't want to do that.
