Subject: Jumped a lady. State of humanity report...

Today on the way home I stopped to get gas. Before I got out of my bus a
Cuban lady came up to me and asked if I spoke spanish :( I dont hardly.. 
(anyone thats been in miami much will know that lots of people here dont
speak english well or at all even)...anyway...She explained to me in
broken spanglish that she needed a jump and had cables and her batt was
dead and tick tick tick was all she heard when she tried. I assured her
that I had no problem helping in a few when I finished pumping my gas. She
was extremely happy and proceeded to explain to me how noone would help
her although she had been asking. Well I backed up the bus and jumped
her minivan and all was good and her little son and her could now drive
home which is when I got to thinking about the state of our fellow drivers
and how we differ from them and the rift is, I think, getting wider.

As I looked at the other cars and drivers in the gas station It occured to
me that maybe it was not just a case of non-empathy that led them to not
help her but perhaps a social change WRT automobiles and our relationship
with them. It occured to me that perhaps with the disposable cars lasting
perhaps 7-10 years and 100-150,000 miles coupled with the fact that they
take virtually no maintenance except for a few 10 minute oil changes
over there lifetime would lead to a generation of people that have almost
never been under the hood of their cars. There is a weak urban myth that
allowing someone to tap into your cars electric will potentially damage
its delicate systems and they have no knowledge of their own to offset
this fear. No wonder they were too scared to give the poor lady a jump. 

This is the just the first generation to grow up this way and it will
only become more of the general social norm as time passes. Thinking this
way makes me more appreciate the newbies and younger of us even more. Hope
theyll be there when I need a jump.
cheers
