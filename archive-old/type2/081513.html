&gt; &gt;&gt;Ball joints were $120.00, labor was $180.00 w/
&gt; an additional $45.00 for realignment.
&gt; Labor time charged was 4.0 hours for the job.&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Jeff,
&gt;
&gt; sounds like you got one heck of a deal to me. even
&gt; doing this job myself i still spent about $250+.
&gt;
&gt; take care of that mechanic!
&gt;
&gt; maybe when the bus i have now needs ball joints i will
&gt; make the trek across country to get it done. ;-)
&gt;
&gt; happy friday,
&gt;
