Ok, I have a 78 type 2 Transporter.  2.0 FI.  I have
replaced the plugs, wires, cap, rotor, vacuum advance
line.  Anybody have any other ideas what to do next?? 
Oh Yeah, I replaced the fuel filter also.

Should one be able to feel the Fuel pump move or
something when cranking?  Is it right in front of the
fuel filter like I think this thing is?  Also, the
tank leaks, so I know that is something I need to do.

I would really like to get her to fire up, just so I
feel better about having her.

Any Ideas?

Mark
