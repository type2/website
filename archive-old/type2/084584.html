&gt;Thanks for all the information on jacks/stands yesterday.  In the end I
&gt;went to costoco and found a good jack and stand set for 100$CAN or about
&gt;62$US.  They each support 3 tons.  I feel confident these will be a good
&gt;buy and ultimately will save money by doing all repairs myself.

I've seen too many close calls with jackstands.  I *never* get underneath 
my bus or any vehicle without *at least* two independent means of 
support.  For one end of the vehicle that means a pair of good 4-legged 
jackstands and a good floor jack that is holding a small amount of the 
vehicle weight.  If I have removed the wheels I place them under the frame 
in the hopes that I might be simply pinned rather than crushed.  I use 
ramps in place of the jackstands when I can.  I feel ramps are superior to 
jackstands because they have a broader base and no moving parts.  BTW 
Steve, you can jack up a non-running vehicle and put ramps underneath it, 
you don't have to drive onto them.  :-)

p.s. If you're inclined to blow off this subject and not use redundant 
supports, think about what it would be like to have a 3,000 lb hunk of 
metal crush you, and how long it might take you to die while you lie there 
suffering.  Think about what it will be like for your spouse/kid to find 
you there dead.  Take the extra few minutes every single time to prevent this.
