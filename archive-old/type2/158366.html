Subject: RE: [T2] Wiring Harness

Greetings Group,

Unfortunately, I do not have one for sale -- I am also interested in
purchasing a wiring harness.  (I am considering replacing the one in my '71
Camper).  Information as to where to look would be greatly appreciated!  In
a nutshell, I suffer from &quot;spaghetti&quot; wire syndrome as I think my Camper
has been hacked and re-hacked (from an electrical standpoint) over the
years.

BTW, I find it interesting that most shops selling complete wiring harness
packages *do not* offer a complete package for the '71 Camper.  A &quot;main&quot;
harness is typically offered, but not a *complete* package.

Wonder why?

Regards,
David

HI LIST.........first thank you all for being so helpful. OK i have a 68
bus that i have put a 71 wiring harness in ........its worked out good i
mean i have found places for everything but i am having a SHIT of a time
getting everthing to work. I removed this harness myself from the 71 bus
and i didnt take anything apart.........But before removing it i had hopes
of restoring it and took it to a body shop for some repairs and it sat out
in the elements exposed for over eight months. NOW everything that worked
doesnt. I can get one thing to work another quits....plus this thing has so
many splices in it it looks like its gone through a shredder. What i was
wondering if there was anyone out there that might have a complete wiring
harness for a 70-71 bus that they would sell me.....including the ignition
and turnsignal wiring (from the actual ignition and turnsignal controls)
Thanks
Rus
