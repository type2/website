&gt; Once all the oil was cleaned of the heatexchangers they were 
&gt; in a much better condition than I imagined. Does anyone
&gt; advocate a permanent oil leak as a form of rustproofing.

Actually, I'm worried about my heat exchangers now, because before I
replaced the pushrod tube seals, each side had a steady coat of oil on
them, now they're dry all the time.  But they are painted and hopefully
they won't rust (they're $$$$$expensive).  

That was the one advantage to leaky pushrod tube seals :)
