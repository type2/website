Fixed the problem today.  I did, in fact, have a variation on my &quot;truly 
scary&quot; scenario above.

Here is a picture of what I saw when I crawled under the Bus today:

	http://www.shagadelic_dot_org/photos/solenoid-30-loose.jpg

Note the loop terminal on the battery positive strap is not over the 
terminal 30 stud on the solenoid (center of photo, see the yellow crimp 
jacket just to the left of the solenoid terminal nut).  It had 
apparently been resting against it well enough to complete the circuit 
until one day (apparently Tuesday while trying to start it up) it just 
wasn't.

Anyway, pulled the nut, put the loop over the stud where it belongs, 
cabled everything back up, tightened the nut, and viola -- everything 
is as it should be again.  My cold start problem is even gone (perhaps 
I had weak spark as a result of the poor connection ... though, in all 
fairness, I did wiggle the wire on Temp Sensor 2; I was going to 
replace it until it started raining hard enough for me to want to go 
back inside).

I wonder just how long that wire had been in that condition.  I wonder 
if the screw-up happened when the fuel lines were replaced, or when the 
engine was replaced?  (Though, I don't know of any reason why pulling 
wires off the solenoid would be required for either of those tasks.)

I replaced the battery ground strap and put a new loop terminal on the 
lead from the alternator to the positive battery terminal for good 
measure (might as well; I had the battery out to take it to the FLAPS 
for testing).

Anyway, thanks again for the help, everybody!
