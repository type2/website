If you're going to a darker color there are a variety of vinyl dyes
available.  Some (most) are more of a &quot;paint&quot; that sprays on.  Contact a
local automotive upolstery supply house, they usually carry a line or two
of these.  Failing that some autobody/paint supply stores will carry these
dyes as well.

I've only used them a wee bit and don't have any recommendations or
longevity information.
