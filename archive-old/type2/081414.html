&gt;I have seen where you might have to polrize the
&gt;reg. after hooking up the battery wrong. not hard too do just cross the Df
&gt;and D termnals just for a second. I have seen many a bug come in with the
&gt;battery hooked up wrong and the only thing it messed with were thw signals.

When either the generator or regulator have been disconnected,
the generator must be polarized. This ensures that residual magnetism
in the pole shoes have the correct polarity. Reversed polarity burns out
the regulator relay contacts. Polarizing a burnt regulator does not repair it.
It is possible to scrape off the residue, but the plating is destroyed.
Alternator systems are not polarized. Some bears are.
