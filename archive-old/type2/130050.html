Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal/installation *Completed!*

Well, the verdict is that it went pretty smoothly with the bus on the 
ground.  I did notice that the tranny was sloped down, so it looked like I 
needed to support it to match up with the engine.

I thought I would be slick and use my floor jack for the tranny, and rest 
the engine on some ramps.  That way I could align the two, and then slide 
the engine on the ramps (they are the type you drive up onto to lift a car 
w/o jacking it up).  Anyway, I forgot to put the engine mounts back on the 
rear support bar, so I ended up jacking up the engine with the floor jack, 
pulling them apart, installing the mounts, and then putting them back 
together.

All in all it took way too long (3 hours including putting the tin back 
on), but I managed to get it all together by myself, which I do feel pretty 
good about.  Although, I am a bit tired (and hungry).  It is 2:00am here, 
after all.

Again, thanks to all for your help.

&gt;I think you are right, that you had trouble pulling the engine off the
&gt;spline because the bus was lifted. You should not have to lift your '68 at
&gt;all. Theoretically you can put the engine on the jack, assuming the apron is
&gt;removed, and then just slide it onto the spline, kind of wheel it on in. I
&gt;check several times while they are mating to make sure it's lined up, but
&gt;all I have ever worked on is the pancake engine and it's a bear to line them
&gt;up (because the bus IS lifted. haha). It creates an angle is in a tight spot
&gt;and you have to kind of rock the engine to match it, sometime jacking the
&gt;bus up or down and it's a whole lot of fun.
&gt;
&gt;At any rate you will have better luck this time around and congrats on your
&gt;first engine pull!!
