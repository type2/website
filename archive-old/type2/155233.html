Subject: Re: [T2] Friday - your next camper?

Now to put this completely off the original topic - I've had similar
thoughts with my other cars.  About the only quirky thing I've found
with strangers driving my bus is that nobody seems to know how to put
a VW into reverse anymore.  My mini is even stranger - you pull up on
the gearshift lever to put it into reverse.  With some of my other
vehicles, I've been pretty confident someone would have to tow it to
take it.  How many car thieves out there know that to start a Mazda
Rx-2 with a cold engine requires pulling the choke and giving the gas
pedal two quick pumps (no more, no less) as it's turning over?  Or
that if it's really cold (colder than 0 F), you need to give the
ethelyne glycol pump a couple of jabs first before pulling the choke
and pumping the gas?
