hi people, i have a 76 westy 2.0 motor with a weber carb, i dont know which
one. it has the throttle cable on the battery side and a screw in the middle
at the base.
 how do i set this carb. is the screw in the base a mixture screw for idle or
for running. any help would be great .  anyone know what carb this is? i know
running too lean is bad. how can i tell whether it is to lean or not.

thanks, marty :)
