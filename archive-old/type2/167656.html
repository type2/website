&gt; I've lost the use of my right leg for at least three months and maybe
&gt; a year.  Do you know of anyone who has converted their type 2 to a
&gt; handicapped driver vehicle?

my 78 is equipped with hand controls, a lot easier to do with an automatic
than a stick but can be done,. how much you willing te shell out??? not
free.

a basic set of accellerator/brake controls that will work on a bus is
about $750-900 installed, about half that if you do the installation
yourself.

&gt; It would probably be easier for me to do this to a toyota or
&gt; something, but the seats are so low in them that I will not be able
&gt; to get out of the car.

would still cost the same..maybe a little more
