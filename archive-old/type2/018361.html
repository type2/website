&gt;         I disagree. Why go into manual temperture control? That went out in
&gt; about 1910?
&gt;         VW believed that the VW engine with flaps and a thermostat, and no
&gt; gauges
&gt;          was capable of running from Siberia, to the Sahara and the cooling
&gt; system was automatic.
&gt;         In fact they did get some real lab testing neat near the middle of
&gt; the century.
&gt;         If I had to monitor a temperature gauge, and adjust my driving to
&gt; control the temp,
&gt;         and possibly stop to let it cool off if it got too hot, I wouldn't
&gt; have the vehicle. I'd trade
&gt;         it in on a more modern early 1900's Ford model T, or A.

       Boy, this is turning into dejavu, we just had this discussion about a
year ago or so.
 At any rate, Bill, you seem to misunderstand how the thermostat and flaps
work. Once the engine warms up -- which as I said before, is pretty damn quick
-- the thermostat and flaps just stay wide open until you shut the engine off
and it cools down. There is no &quot;auto-regulation&quot; of any sort from that point
on. They don't help cooling, they just help to get it hot quicker.
