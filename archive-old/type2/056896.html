Subject: Body panel sources

Message text written by &quot;roughwood&quot;
&gt;I'm trolling for opinions on body panels and sources for same.  I live in
the Chicago area,
so J.C. Whitney and MOFOCO are within an hours driving distance.  Because
freight can be costly on large
panels, it would be nice to be able to pick them up, and inspect them
before
purchase.&lt;

Please post your results to the list if they are posted publicly.  

What I have found is that there are basically five factors in dealing with
sheet metal companies: 
a.  Fit
b.  Metal thickness
c.  Price
d.  Shipping practices/time
e.  Helpful/Knowlegable staff

I have ordered numerous body panels from only the top two suppliers in my
mind...Wolfsburg West  and Das Bulli.

#Das Bulli does the best at covering fit and metal thickness with
reasonable shipping. These folks know body panels...not just sell them.  Of
course, with anything, you pay for what you get, so they are a little more
expensive.

#Wolfsburg West has great fit, decent prices, SUPERIOR shipping, but metal
thickness lacks.  Their staff is mostly knowlegable.  Occasionally, I have
talked to this one kid that I am SURE is gay (not that there is anything
wrong with that) that always seems very preoccupied with other things than
my order.  I think he is a BUG lover or something.

#Mofoco:  I have no experiece with but I agree that they are probably on
the JCWHIP level.

#JCWHIP:  Has the most unGodly shipping/stocking practice that I have ever
heard of.  I think they still think this is 1955.  I would definitely have
to rate them at rock bottom on quality but probably best at prices.
