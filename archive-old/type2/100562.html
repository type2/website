Subject: Bad Noise in my engine

My bus is a 1970 Westy sundowner, but thats not important.

My engine is a 1776 that was originally in a karma ghia. I have no real 
knowledge about it other then that, I assume it has high compression and a 
mild cam by the way it runs; fast and hot. I have dual kadrons.

I noticed what sounds like a squeeking sound, like maybe something rubbing, 
comming from the right side of the engine. Front is front. I rev it up past 
idle and I cant detect it, but I sure here it at idle, and when its shutting 
off. Its fairly loud, and I am worried. Broken ring? I thought that would 
sound really rattly not squeeky. I have not adjusted the valves in a while, 
but I have not heard a sound like this before, and I am trying to imagine if 
a valve or the valve train could sound like that.

Otherwise the bus runs fine, lots of power (heh, people's mouths just drop 
when it gets on the freeway, cruising up on ramps and merging into traffic 
like a modern car...).

I am kicking myself for driving it hard, I have owned busses for years and 
years and always babied them, but this one I push real hard. Stupid me.

I would be happy to put a mp3 (or ogg it's better) of the sound onto the web 
if someone would be willing to hear it.

Can you help diagnose a bus noise?

Jason
