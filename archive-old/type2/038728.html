Subject: Sears Allstate Engine

I almost forgot that Sears used to sell almost anything in their catalog
(including motorcycles, scooters and cars), but got a reminder a couple
weeks ago.

My brother-in-law told me the junk man a couple towns away had a &quot;pile of VW
parts&quot; for sale that included an engine for $50.  The price seemed right, so
on Saturday I headed out to see what he had.  Among a bunch of misc. like
coil-over shocks, bug wheels, and a jerry can mount was a semi-disassembled
H case bus engine.  It had dropped a valve in the #2 cylinder.
Interestingly enough, #3 had a cracked cylinder barrel and broken piston
skirt.  Case seems useable though.

On the cooling shroud was a tag that said &quot;Sears Allstate Remanufactured
Engine&quot;.  There's a section called &quot;Specification Information&quot; which says
&quot;Mains Undersize 030, Rods Undersize 030, Cylinder Size 020, Source No.
1609, and Job No. 35920.

Does this mean that the crank has been turned 30-30?  Think any of this
means that it has been align bored?  Any ideas as to what the cylinder size
of 020 means - surely they didn't bore and reuse the cylinders, did they?

At the bottom of the tag in fine print it says &quot;Specially Made for Sears
Roebuck and Co. by V.E.G.E. Motoren Spijkenisse (Holland).  I wonder if that
means the tag, or if they did the rebuild.

Anyway, maybe useless information.  Might make a neat addition to the
rebuilt engine though.  Sears engines were quite common I think.

Later,
Dean
