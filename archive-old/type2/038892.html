&gt; &gt; This is tricky, since you don't want current feeding back from the &quot;aux&quot;

&gt; You could just run a &quot;always hot&quot; wire to a switch, then splice the switched
&gt; end of the switch to the wire that is connected to the &quot;hot when bus is on&quot;
&gt; wire, then to the appropriate wire on the radio.

the problem with this method is that the &quot;aux&quot; switch will feed current
back to the ignition side of the fuse block unless I've missed something.

I also thought of a way to do this with a DPDT switch.  You could wire it
up os that when the switch is in one position the radio is hot when the
ignition is off and in the other position the ignition must be on for the
radio to be hot.

This would be a better method than the diode method, as the diode would
have a built-in voltage drop.
