Subject: Re: [T2] Timing 2.0 litre engine.

dave:

having a conglomerate bus (76 body/79 cal. engine #GE053238) it took me a
while to figure out what to do.

I recently timed mine to 5 degrees atdc with both hoses connected and it's
running really well. The 5 degreees is per Muir, I don't have any idea if
the hoses are correct.

Verify you distributor p/n if you haven't already.

List?

&gt; Hi volks
&gt;
&gt; I am trying to finding timing specs for a recently installed 2.0 litre
&gt; engine. Engine # GE047575. I am finding conflicting specs in all my
&gt; manuals. Whether vac hoses connected or not as well.
