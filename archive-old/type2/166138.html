Subject: Qu re CS valve and vacuum testing

Tuned up daughter's bus; plugs were nice light gray with clean 
insulators, compression variable (111,120, 125,133 -still starts hard 
when cold; likely Cold-Start valve itself as giving it juice directly 
while a fuel pressure gauge was attached did not drop the pressure from 
around 32 with a full minute of attachment- anyone know how long this 
should take?
    I put a vac gauge in the line that goes from airbox nib to pressure 
regulator and airfilter valve.  Only 11.5 at idle, and increased to a 
max of 16.5 as rpms were slowly increase- am I using the wrong vac 
takeoff point or is this an air leak (none obvious)?
