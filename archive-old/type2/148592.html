Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Re: Stranded, Ignition switch won't turn all the
  way

Howdy,

So it appears I have the ignition key problem fixed, at least ont the
bench (couch). Problem was an offending little spring, and a little
cup thing (looks like a thimble but about 100 times smaller) that sat
on the end of the spring. I belive the purpose of these pieces was to
activate the key reminder buzzer. The spring was all mangled. I
removed both peices. The only result I can identify is that the brown
wire (key buzzer) no longer gets any power. I tested the outher switch
outputs at various poitions and they all appear normal. Key now
travels its full path. No more hangups!

The brown wire wasn't connected to begin with so nothing lost either.

I'll do the reinstall tomorrow and let everyone know how it works out.

Thanks for all the helpful tips and suggestions, they were invaluable.

And to the lismemember who offered the deal on replacement parts,
let's still talk, you can never have too many spares of failure prone
parts.

Thanks
Jules
