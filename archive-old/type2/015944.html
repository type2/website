&gt;Or the filler hose. I don't think you can access any of this stuff
*without* pulling the firewall. 

One of them can.  In my case, it was the one that was leaking.  It's the
one right next to the filler hose and therefore you can reach it through
the round access hole with the black lid in it.  I'd check this one first
to see if it's the problem before you go to all the trouble of removing the
panel.  You might not be able to see it, but you can reach it.
