Thanks for the reply David,

&gt;You are making good progress and your observation of the spark plug
&gt;temperatures was a good one.  Belive it or not, from what you say above I
&gt;suspect your right carbuerator and not the 009 (but I still think it will
&gt;run smoother with the stock distributor).  If one or all cylinders are
&gt;misbehaving I suspect an electrical problem.  Two cylinders misbehaving and
&gt;I suspect the carb, since each is responsible for two cylinders.  I can't
&gt;remember if you have checked your carbs out or not... have you?  If not,
&gt;it's possible the right one could use a rebuild.



Yes I have already rebuilt both carbs recently.


I'll try your suggestions and see if it works.

Thanks again,
