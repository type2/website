A flywheel is a method of storing energy.  Use energy to spin the
flywheel, then it will spin for a while until you need the energy back.
It sounds like it wouldn't work, but believe it or not it does, and pretty
well too.  

A diesel bus was fitted with a flywheel that absorbed energy when the bus
braked, then when it wanted to accelerate from a stop, the energy in the
flywheel was used to get it up and moving.  This reduced fuel consumption
by 20%, if you can believe it.

There are some verystrange ideas for energy storage out there-compressed
air, hydrogen, pumped hydro-storage.  Nothing seems to be working well
enough to follow up on it though, at least now that oil is cheaper than
ever.
