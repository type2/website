Subject: #53

Just saw an interesting site on TV.

There's a NASCAR race at the California Raceway (not sure which race) on
Channel 26 right now (NBC?).  During the pace lap, they focused in on a VW
beetle at the rear of the pack.  Turns out that someone's filming a remake
of Herbie the Love Bug.

Had to smile at the sight of that white beetle in a pack of NASCAR speed
demons. :O)

Whoohoo!  Go #53!
