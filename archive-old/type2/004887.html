Hi folks,
I had the misfortune of a dropped valve seat in my '74 Westy,, 1.8 liter
dual carb
I have located a replacement head that is in fairly good shape,, But, the
combustion chambers appear to be different!  The one has approx 1mm step
that looks like a head gasket or shim, and the other is flat where the
cylinder barrel contacts the head..
,,they are both 021-101-371S castings,, one has #37 and the other has a #39
,,,they both have 2 holes for air pump injection,  they both have the same
size valves,, 34mm Exh and 41mm Intake valves


I wanted to know if someone can point out the differences?.. Why is there a
&quot;step&quot; where the cylinder seats against the head??   is one for a higher
compression engine?
Thanks!

here is alist of what I know about Type 4 Cylinder Heads
author unknown
1.7 Series
Part Number Engine Valve Sizes, intake x exhaust, mm Notes
021-101-371J 1700 39.3 x 33 Some had breather pipe or CHT sensor fitting for
carb. vehicles; some also had EGR holes by intake ports.
021-101-371Q 1700 39.3 x 33
021-101-372 1700 39.3 x 33

The 1.7 heads can be interchanged with 1.8/2.0 cylinders. It will be
necessary to machine the opening to match the larger cylinder end.

1.8/2.0 Series
Part Number Engine Valve Sizes, intake x exhaust, mm Notes
021-101-371H 1800 41 x 34
or
39.3 x 34 f.i. models had the smaller valve sizes; some had EGR holes; some
had CHT sensor
021-101-371S 1800 41 x 34   or   39.3 x 34
022-101-372G 2000 37.5 x 33 CHT sensor on one side; sodium filled exhaust
valves
071-101-371A 2000 37.5 x 33 The &quot;Vanagon&quot; head; exhaust ports not compatible
with earlier exhaust systems or most aftermarket exhausts.
071-101-371B 2000 37.5 x 33
039-101-371A 2000 42 x 36 The highly desired 914 head; easily identified by
3-intake port studs; steeper spark plug angle. Generally believed to be the
best starting point for highest HP.
