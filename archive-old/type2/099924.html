Subject: RE: How to Contact David Bennett

&gt;Dave just called me back. He is now in a Super 8 Motel Room 211
&gt;You can reach him at ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT he says at 719-597-4100
&gt;He's at the corner of Hwy 24 and Peterson Rd. in Colorado Springs, CO

I just called the Super 8 and they said Dave already checked out.  Anyone
know if he still needs help or what his status is?

Thanks.
