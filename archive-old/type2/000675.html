My other car is a 93 Saturn SC2. I was working on it a few weeks ago when I
noticed that the FI connections looked similar to the van but much nicer. A
spare bus injector fit just perfect in every aspect, even better; the module
has a quick release on it and what looks like a silicone seal up inside.
Just squeeze the sides together and you can easily remove them. Not bulky
either. This is what I'd use.

As for the numbering, use your computer and Word or some such program.
Better some numbering than none! Then cover the label with a short section
of clear heat shrink. This would protect the work.

&gt;There must be a source for the small female connectors and the small
&gt;plugs. It would be nice to work out a way to put the red numbers on the
&gt;new white wires, but maybe not essential.
