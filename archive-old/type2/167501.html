&gt;   I am the rpoud owner of what I thought was a 1972 riviera, but I am

congratulations

&gt;   Did the 72 bus have the access hatch to the engine, the one inside
&gt; the bus that is over the engine?

no

&gt;   What otrher things can I look at besides the vin to know?
&gt;
&gt;   The vin plate that is inside the engine compartment has obviously
&gt; been changed and welded in, poorly. But it matches what is on the dash and
&gt; the title says 72.
&gt;
&gt;   The VIN is 2322140006

that is the VIN for a 1972

&gt;   Also what engine do I have? The number on the fan housing is GD006046
&gt;   Where else can I look at the engine for a number?

fan housings can be changed, it is also stamped on the block near ignition
coil and on the crankcase below the breather (not visible)

a GD engine is a 2 liter  67hp engine, and not stock on a 72
