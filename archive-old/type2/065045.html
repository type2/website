It's a shame to cut it in half. I'd think a restoed VW w/ boards hanging 
from the top would be a better sales gimmic, and more practical.

Being from the UK, you may have seen VWs in use as commercial vehicles. 
Frankly, I've always been interested in picutures of the old VWs being 
used in this capacity. I'd love to have one of the single cabs w/ the 
advertising rack on back (I've never seen one in real life).

&gt; YAAAY! Thanks for the credit Clara. _Some_ (please chill on the
&gt; flames just MHO) Americans seem to use the term USA and N.
&gt; America interchangeably since the feel the continent ends at the
&gt; northern US border.

Sorry Michael and Clara, but I WAS including Canada when I said North 
America (and I purposely excluded Mexico). We know that VWs south of the 
border were used for just about every purpose. I saw a beetle cut behind 
the rear seat, with a cap of corrogated material added, similar to 
some of the Morris caps. It was used to delivery produce.

As for Canada, my knowledge is limited to a couple trips to Vancouver 
(and area) in 69 and 72. I didn't see VWs being used for commercial use 
there, but would love to hear of some.

I wasn't aware of import duties on VWs in the 60s. I do know most of the 
businesses would use Ford and Chevy vans (even some Corvairs), but 
didn't consider VWs. Maybe it was in the way VofA advertised their rigs 
here vs how they pushed the VW in Europe.

In Europe they were presented as an alternative, and they stressed their 
&quot;reliability&quot; and good fuel economy. In the US they were advertised as 
&quot;ugly but practical&quot;. What other company would describe their new model 
of car as &quot;for a box, it's deluxe, as a station wagon, it's a box&quot;, or 
something like that.
