Subject: [T2] Welders

Hey all,
I know the subject of welders has come up before, but I need to do a lot of
welding on my 71 Westy and am getting a late Christmas present from my wife.
She told me I could get a welder up to a certain dollar amount. I know that
Miller, Lincoln, and Hobart are some of the best out there, but they are too
much. Also I will not be useing it everyday just often. So, I found that
Campbell Hausfeld sells a wireweed/mig, with regulator for gas called the
105. Does anyone have one of these? Do you know anything about them? Regular
price is about $339, they have reconditioned ones for $229 online. Add the
price of the Bottle and thats about the price limit I have.
Please do not tell me to get a Lincoln or miller or other high priced brand,
I can not afford it. I am also not going to use it enough to justify the
high price. It is hobby only.
I will also use it on the type 4 conversion.
