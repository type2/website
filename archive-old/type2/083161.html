Subject: Re: [T2] Parts List to fix Troy's broken bus.....

I'll have my torque wrenches there. (not the nice clicky ones but the
old fashion pendulum type) &amp; what trip in a bus would be complete w/o
vice-grips :)

I hate to add, but does anyone have opinions on if troy should also
get a throwout bearing?

&gt; Ok,
&gt;             Here is the list of parts that I plan to buy from Joe at
&gt; BustedBus and have shipped tomorrow.
&gt;  
&gt; Engine seal (Flywheel and Crank seal)
&gt; Transmission shaft seal
&gt; Clutch disk
&gt; Flywheel washer
&gt; Wrench for flywheel (Cant remember name, Joe said its special tool that
&gt; costs only few bucks.)
&gt;             
&gt;             This list alone will be pushing my budget.  From what I have
&gt; gathered, it seems I will need a small sledge hammer, torque wrench, and
&gt; some vice-grips.  Sorry to say I do not have these three.  Think I will
&gt; be able to scavenge these at EB?  I will be bringing basically all the
&gt; tools I have.  That should cover the common stuff such as sockets,
&gt; screwdrivers, pliers, etc.  I also have only one bottle jack rated at 6
&gt; tons and the stock jack that came with the bus.  I was also unable to
&gt; find a place to get a seal remover in short time.  So, anything missing
&gt; that I should add?  Oh, I would be willing to donate my engine to see
&gt; who is faster at pulling the engine or engine/tranny.  :-)
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks again everyone.
