Subject: Megasquirt

OK, all you Megasquirt gurus.   I'm in the bus for the long haul.  I have a 2.0 engine to rebuild and install in either my bus or another rust-free bus that I purchase down the road.  When I do, I'd like to install a Megasquirt setup.  For now, I'm sticking with the single Weber because it is so simple and it is performing so well for me.  

Just curious:  on all of the newer cars I've owned with computers and FI, you don't really have to warm the engine.  You really can't tell any difference running it cold than running it hot because the computer adjusts for everything. So you guys with the Megasquirt, is that true for your busses? Now, I've never believed that it is good to run even a newer vehicle stone cold.  But some say that it is actually better to drive it and let it warm up under load.  I'm not qualified technically to get in that debate.  Now I HAVE to warm the bus up before it will run well.    

I eventually plan on having a permanently installed laptop in my bus among multiple other electronic devices including a ham radio station.  I'd like to have it hooked up so I can constantly monitor all aspects of the engine.  From what I've read, I believe that is possible.  Installing it and getting it to work is going to be the hard part as I'm not a mechanic or an electronics expert. 

Right now I'm in the planning stages.  Any advice will be appreciated.  Cheers...KR
