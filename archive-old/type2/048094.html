Subject: [T2] My Halloween 

Tonight being Halloween, and wanting to do something a bit different while
handing out candy, my son and I decorated our '78 Westy with orange and
purple lights, strings of ghosts and scarecrow lights as well as a couple of
flashing jack-o-lanterns. We sat in the bus and the reaction from kids was
pretty amazing. Some were really amazed and said things like &quot;Neat van&quot;
while some couldn't focus on putting their bags out for us to drop candy in
because they were too busy checking things out.

Some of the parents were very impressed and said it was the best display
they had seen all night.  I snapped a picture before we finished for the
night :

Next year, I think I'll invest in more lights and really make it special!
