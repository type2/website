Well, I shud be away from this swamp called Houston by tomorrow.

I am going to unsubscribe myself from the list so as to lighten up my
mailbox load and allow fairly fast downloads on those occasions that
might allow me to make a connect while on the road.

I am hoping to meet a few new bus faces during this trip, and am
looking forward to the ride.

Bob in Houston
