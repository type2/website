Subject: My new 1972 bus

Ok Volks, , , here’s the skinny on my brand new
(to me) 1972 bus.

First of all, it’s not in as bad condition as I originally thought
it was. The body is straight, with no dings dents or paint
problems. It was originally purchased in Berkley, California,
(Hippy  Country) in Sept. 1972. It was last registered in 1984.

The interior has dried out, as might be expected, but not severely,
as I have seen others that were beyond reviving, but this isn’t all
that bad. My No.2 Son got right with it. After plugging the brake
vacuum line back in and driving down to get gas, it seems to run
quite well, but very hot on the short 4 block run. The problem is
that it stalls when you step on the gas from a dead stop.
The engine sounds and otherwise runs very well,
quiet and solid.

The sun roof handle broke off when Son tried to
open the roof. Now, he’s focused on getting the roof to open,
with not very much luck. The roof will drop slightly in the rear,
but that’s as far as it will go. No amount of banging will force it
any  further. Any suggestions? This is the big 4' steel roof.

Overall, I don’t think I did too bad for $600.00
Take a look and tell me what you think at:
