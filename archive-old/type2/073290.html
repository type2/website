I seem I have a burnt bulb.

Thanks again.

&gt;Hey All,
&gt;	This should be an easy one. Last night our '78 bus's turn signals
&gt;went belly-up. They are blinking real fast. My first concern is that they
&gt;are having a flash back to the days of disco. Maybe a bad bulb or fuse?
&gt;
&gt;Any one want to take a crack at this.
&gt;Perhaps I can pickup the parts on the way home.
