&gt;&quot;BPRS Route Notice&quot;

Okay, here's mine:

North on I-35 to I-90.
East on I-90/21 to Oshkosh, WI.
North on 41 to Green Bay, WI
North on 57 to Sturgeon Bay, WI. arrive Friday July 2

Leave Monday, July 5
NorthEast through the U/P of Michigan to Sudbury, Ontario
Check out some provincial parks?
South to Toronto, Buffalo (have to stop and make fun of the Sabres for
losing the Stanley Cup to the STARS!)
Wander back towards Dallas, route will present itself I suppose. 
Arrive in Dallas, TX July 12-ish

Anyone along that route that would like to chat over a beer, discuss
busses, politics, life, whatever, please contact me.  I'd also be
interested in things to see/do along the return route.

Happy Camping to all!
