Subject: BN4 Heater Repair

Hello All,

I've been working on my BN4 which works intermittently.  I used the =
EXTREMELY helpful &quot;Early BN4 Repair&quot; page by Ron Van Ness to thoroughly =
check my heater and have performed nearly all the tests and checks he =
lists on his page.  I've also used the Eberspaecher manual and video =
that Rick Taylor made available after he put on the heater workshop =
about a year ago in Kansas.  I've narrowed the problem down to my fuel =
pump and pressure regulator.  I need to replace the diaphragms in both =
these; I'm unable to locate a source locally for the 1/64&quot; (0.016&quot;) =
thick petroleum resistant, rubberized cloth/nylon thread reinforced =
diaphragm material he used in his procedure (I've gotten some strange =
looks when I explain what I'm looking for around here...).  The best I =
can find on the internet is 0.5 mm (0.020&quot;) thick buna-N sheet rubber at =
McMaster-Carr; most other places I checked can only get it in 1/32&quot; =
(0.031&quot;) thickness.  Does anybody know of a good source for about a =
square foot of the appropriate material?

Thanks again to Ron and Rick for making such great information available =
to all of us on the list.  I really appreciate it!  It's people like you =
who not only have the technical ability to meticulously fix this stuff, =
but the patience to document it and put it in a format the rest of us =
can easily use that make it possible for all of us to keep 30+ year old =
vehicles safely on the road.  You guys are great!
