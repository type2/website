Subject: Re: [T2] WAS  RE: no brake NOW Is there a Diagram?

&gt; Does anyone know if there is a 68 or 69 wiring diagram with 10 fuses and
no 9pin flasher box?

I have the VW factory bus repair manual [not Bentley] that was printed by VW for 68 to 70 buses. Copyright
1970.
It has 2 wiring diagrams in it: US version from August 67 and US version from August 69. The 1st one would be
for 68 and 69. Sorry, it is 10 fuse and 9 pin. The 2nd one is 12 fuse.
