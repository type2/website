Subject: RE: [T2] Engine stand and POR 15

I have an engine stand that I got from a local (Salem Or.) VW parts house.
It said Heavy Duty on it and is a bench style. It is made of steel tubing
and it Royaly SUCKS!!! I put my 1800cc short block on it and it started to
bend. I had to put a jack stand under the front of the engine to hold up the
front. If I remove the stand it will fold the engine stand up like a
pretzel. I removed the bench mount part and welded a larger tube to it and
am using it in a V8 style engine stand. 
I do have a better stand though. I took and old 002 bellhousing and cut off
half of the 'bell'. It now is mounted to another V8 engine stand I have and
it is holding up a 2.0l engine now with no trouble. I can rotate it around
and it does not flex the stand at all. Total cost to me was free, but you
can get a V8 engine stand strong enough for a VW engine for about $50 from
Harbor Freight or any FLAPS. Then get an old 091/002 bellhousing and there
you go. You can use an old Bug trans also, but you will have to use a
Sawsall to cut the bellhousing off, 091s, and 002s just unbolt it.

Subject:	[T2] Engine stand and POR 15

Hello all, I've got 2 questions for the list.  Has anyone purchased an
engine 
stand from RMMW and if so is it capable of holding a 1800cc motor.  In the 
catalog it didn't look all that strong to me but hey what do I know.  If 
anyone knows of a better source for picking up a floor standing engine stand

I'd appreciate it.  Second question, has anyone used the POR15 heat
resistant 
paint on their heater boxes.  If the regular POR15 last forever wouldn't it 
be a good idea to coat the heater boxes with the heat resistant stuff?  I'm 
going to need a new heater boxes and the thought of spending all that bread 
just to have them rust away in 2 years is painful.  Any input is always 
appreciated.  Marcus
