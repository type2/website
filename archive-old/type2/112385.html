Subject: Re: [T2] Am I on the right track??

I recently had the green wire from the coil to the dizzy come loose, 
livening up my freeway commute a little.

Always rule out the easiest/cheapest solutions before you go replacing 
anything. Make sure all wires are whole, connected and getting a good 
ground. Also that your battery terminals have a good connection.

&gt; Muir says replace the coil, I'll do that. I haven't chacked my points 
&gt; yet, but
&gt; they probably need replacing as well.  Am I on the right track? Or am I
&gt; missing something.
