From: &quot;Billy&quot; &lt;wfp3_at_lycos_dot_com&gt;
&gt; are we talking FRESH oregano or DRIED?

Then there was the dear old lady who carefully bagged the lawn clippings
from her yard in small plastic bags, advertised in the back of a magazine
that she was selling &quot;bags of grass&quot; for $2.00 each, and made a healthy
income until the USPS shut her down.

Seems that there wasn't anything illegal about what she was doing, just that
it was a tad &quot;unethical&quot;.  I don't believe that she was prosecuted, just
made to cease sales.

I've gotten some less than stellar respect from only one officer so far,
since getting G on the road.  It still stings to have heard that &quot;Boy!&quot;,
especially with the unique connotations of that word when spoken in that
manner down here in the deep south.

Funny thing is, I grew up during the 60's and have never done drugs of any
sort except for illness-related meds.
