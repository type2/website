Subject: Re: My mechanic is stumped, and I am ready to cry!

	Beth,
	It bucks in low gears, not in high gears (thinks, hmm, more inertia
in high gear..). Does it backfire when it bucks? If so I'd have mechanic-san
check the ignition again. Points have been replaced, how 'bout condensor
and wires? Cap and Rotor?  What color are the spark plugs? Sooty? Clean?
light brown indicating too-lean a burn?

	Try a swap with another engine's parts, just to troubleshoot, or
with the last-working-set you saved from last tune-up. (that's why
you save them)

	Bucking could be bad sparks from any number of sources- coil,
the condensor and wires I just mentioned. I've had two major points
failures in my life and replacing them is a good start, but they
aren't the only suspects in that area.

	The wire from the points to the coil might be intermitantly grounding-
which would give bad sparks and backfires, but not just while accelerating.

	Bucking could also be jumping distributor- which an ignition
strobe timing light or dwell meter should show easily. Distributor
drive OR vaccuum hose problems could cause this. Will it buck if
running without a load? If you just step on the accelerator while
the bus is idling?

	Low fuel pressure from a bad pressure regulator or worn-out
resistance tracks in the air-flow sensor (If applicable) strike
me as possible causes too- the later more likely, but harder
to check. Other '78 owners? 

	Bill
