Subject: Adjusting hydraulic lifters

I replaced all the push rod tube seals on the other side.  Everything sounds
ok after the lifters pumped up.

However, the slightly valve train noise I used to hear on the passenger side
I now hear on the driver side.

I've read all the articles on hydraulic lifters in the library and at
BostonEngine but I've got information overload and I'm not sure what to do
about it.

Help.

Previously I said:

I started late in the afternoon but I got the one side done that drips.  Not
hard but a lot of cleaning work and it's murder or your neck under there.

The spring retainer can be hard to get into position.

I had some trouble with one seal almost getting pinched but I backed out the
tube and corrected it.  I'm going to remove all the grime underneath with a
degreaser and wash up to see what's going on now.  It was pretty grimy.

The old seals popped out easily compared to the new Vitons that went in.
The large orange seals were soft and loose and the small black ones were
hard and tight.  My leaks were coming from the head end.

I replaced my bails and valve covers at the same time because they were all
rusted.  Skipped the valve adjustment. ;-)

I checked the lifters and they were rock hard.  Engine had been sitting for
a week so I think that's a good sign; I put them back in with the oiling
hole on top.
