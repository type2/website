Subject: Re: [T2] bus sandblasted, priming now, acrylic hardener or not?

I hope you haven't primed it yet with laquer based primer--
If your looking for a forever paint job-- follow these
hints--instructions--

You need three products to lock the metal down from ever rusting /
corroding again, and will hold down any paint--

First wipe the bare metal down with          # 244S Duponts Metal Prep,
let dry and apply a coat of 615S mixed with 616S Vari Prime--it's an
acid etch prmer.
Let that dry for a couple of hours ,and sand with 320--
Apply a coat of either 1120 S or 1140S Uro prime--a superior urethane
non moisture sucking primer--it's actually put a rubber bag over the
surface that you want to paint---
I also add Duponts flex agent to the primer---make it bullet proof.

Now about the Centari---

In my professional opinion forget this stuff---
For the price your paying for it--and for a couple of bucks more you can
get a lifetime finish--in half the drying time---  
PPG's Concept is just about the finest paint you can apply--and dust
free in 10 minutes---

I prefer a base clear coat over straight colr--just because the clear
keeps the UV off the pigment making for a longer lasting shine--much
more durable.
I also add flex agent to all the clearcoats I do--it keeps the small
dings, dents and rock chip free--

All hardened paint's with a catylist has isocyanates in them--and a mask
is manditory---and the hardner is the ticket for the paints
longevity--it puts a skin on the top surface of the paint to protect the
pigments below it--

Have Fun--
