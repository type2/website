 CB Performance now has direct replacements for the solex 34 pdsit's, these
don't have all the BS as the older ones.

Subject: [T2] Carbs for a 73 Bus


I'm thinking about switching out my old stock Solex carbs for something
newer that would add a little power to the engine. I don't want anything
huge, close to the stock size would be fine by me, but the availability of
parts for the old solex stuff is slightly depressing. Anyone have any advice
about which brand/model(s) to look at? Or is there a place I can get parts
and such for the stock ones?
