Subject: horns -- why I want one!

Hey all,
Interesting thread.  

I don't use my horn much, in fact I hardly ever use it at all.  But, the
times when i do wind up using it, I REALLY need it -- having a working
horn has prevented a couple accidents that would have been caused by
stupid other drivers.

Such as driving on I-95 and someone starts easing their way into your
lane when you're right next to them!  Or when you're passing that
tractor trailer and he starts coming over when you're next to the
trailer -- BTDT, it is NOT fun =:0 .  \

Or, as someone else mentioned, those folks who back up or pull out without
looking.  Or those idiots on car phones!!!!!!!!!

Saw a bumper sticker that I really want:  Said &quot;Hang Up and Drive!&quot;

In some states your horn has to work for the car to be street legal
and/or pass inspection.

So, I don't use it much, but when I use it it becomes vitally important.

Sean
