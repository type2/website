Subject: Outdoor Storage Options

Hello List,

Looking for advice on outdoor storage options for my bus.

I'm not going to be able to work on or drive my bus for a few (4-6 or more) months as work will be keeping me too busy to do anything on my bus.  I used to keep it in the garage, but my new house is a one-car garage affair, with no room for a car in it for the long term.  My bus leaks quite badly at the usual area under the windshield and needs to be covered from rain/moisture.  The paint/finish are not a concern (original paint visible under the rust...) and will be redone properly after a fair bit of bodywork sometime in the future.  I just want to protect my bus from the harshest elements and further serious damage.  Does anyone have first hand experience with using any of the various grades of custom car covers available (tyvek/&quot;ultimate&quot;/etc)?  I want to avoid trapping moisture between the cover and the bus.  The various 10'x20' awnings available are not my preferred option due to concerns with the neighbors.  I checked the list library and archives without much luck.

Thanks all,

Markus Bahnemann
