I recently purchased a '70 Westy, and have installed a new engine that I had
in another '70 bus. The problem is the headlights and parking lights are not
coming on, and when I turn the key I get no click or anything from the
starter.  When I first hooked up my new battery, I had hazard lights only.
Then I noticed a large red wire had come loose from the fuse box.  When I
reconnected that wire, most of my lights (interior, dash, turn signals, and
brakes) started working.  But still have no headlights or parking lights.  I
also have a new starter and voltage regulator that I have not installed yet,
but may do that today.  Any ideas?  Feel free to e-mail me directly if you
prefer.
Thanks,
Jeff Buckmaster
