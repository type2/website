&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt; Most (if not all) of the stuff I'm using (primers, paints, etc.)in the
&gt; restoration of my '77 Westy have the following warning printed on them
&gt; &quot;WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to
&gt; cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm&quot;. Well, I'm in
&gt; Virginia, so does this mean they are safe to use?

Well...no. Not really. Kinda. Yeah, sure. Depends on how you use them.

You should be using a respirator--a good one with charcoal filters in it,
not one of those five-for-a-buck dust masks that don't even protect against
dust--goggles and at least rubber gloves when you handle any of this stuff,
and when you use paint you should wear a Tyvek bunny suit. Take some
sensible precautions and you'll be fine.
