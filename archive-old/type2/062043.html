Subject: Query re timing 78 distributor

Regarding timing, I'd like to know if others have this much advance in
their distr. which is combo vac/centrifugal in 78 bus- there is a built in
degree gauge, and whew revving up to like 4000 rpm, advance keeps climbing
to a least 42- haven't noticed pinging, but I use medium grade stuff when
in the mtns.....  Mike Benthin- back from 3100 mi Fla trip!!!!!!
