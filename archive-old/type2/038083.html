Subject: 1976 westy interior for sale

Hey everyone buddy i have a interior from a 76 westy bed, fridge, stove/sink. 
If anyone is interested in it make me an offer. I need to get rid of it i 
have way to much stuff right now and this interior takes up alot of space. I 
am located in Belvidere. IL and i would like the person to come get it really 
soon within the next week if possible. I would like to get 150 for it but any 
offer i get will most likely take it. I still also have many parts from the 
70 i am parting out so if there is anything anyone needs let me know i will 
see if i have it.  Thanks alot
