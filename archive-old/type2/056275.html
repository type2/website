Subject: re: Type IV head replacement?

This weekend I checked the compression in my new '78 camper:

Cylinder 1: 90 psi (Upped to 100 with a few drops of oil -&gt; rings)
Cylinder 2: 0 psi
Cylinder 3: 120 psi
Cylinder 4: 114 psi
-----------------------------------------

Nothing at all wrong with your left head.
----------------------------------------------

Number 2 offered no resistance and the engine turned over quickly.

I took it down to the local VW expert and he said I probably have a
burned valve and recommended replacing the entire head ($250 for the head
and $400 for the labor, yikes!).  I asked if it's just a valve why replace
the whole head and he said he'd have to grind down the old head and that's
just as expensive.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Well #1 isn't feeling all that good either. I believe 87 is the lowest
permissable compression on a type iv motor. $250 is realistic replacement cost
via Mark Stephens or AVP who are the quality folks. With any luck you won't
have to get into pistons and rings etc. What you need to do of course to make
it feasible is to do the work yourself and save the $400. Get Wilson's book on
rebuilding a vw for $14 and have at it. No big deal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He also offered (since the mileage on this engine is unknown) to replace
the entire engine for a new one for $2000 ($1600 parts/$400 labor).

In light of the decent compression on one side and the poor compression
on the other, would it be better to fix only the bad side or would I be
better off in the long tem with a new engine?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type iv motors are very, very strong. Absent any other problems spend the few
hundred and stick with the devil you know rather than thousands and an unknown
quantity. Many on the list can sadly report that &quot;new&quot; ain't always what it's
cracked up to be.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or is this mechanic pulling my leg?
-------------------------------------------
His kids have got to eat to.


Good Luck,
