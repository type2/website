Subject: Shipping Vanagon Seats - need some info

Am going to ship some Vanagon seats I'm buying from Jackson, MS to 
Cookeville, TN.

Wondering what you folks paid to ship them, how you boxed them, separately 
or together...

Whatever you can offer. The drive is between 8 hours and 10 hours each way 
so I am feel like the fuel and time would be more expensive than the 
shipping...

Anyone making a similar trip any time soon?

Thanks!
