I just bought West Coast Metric rubber mats (L/R) for about $50.  They were
good quality, pre-formed (I had to make the cut for the seat belt bolt and
the seat runner but the outline was molded into the rubber).  My only
complaint is that these pieces were only the door-side rubber.  Apparently,
there is another piece that covers the front and middle side of the
pedestal.  I also got a carpet kit from WCM, and it included carpet pieces
to cover the entire pedestal, including the back of the passenger seat.  I'm
thinking of returning the rubber.  I believe these carpet pieces can be
bought separately from the entire kit - the kit was $200.
