When I pull the lead off the number four spark plug there is no change in

I don't know much about FI, but my guess would be that your #4 cylinder
isn't getting fuel.  Clogged injector, maybe?

last time the compression was checked (eleven years ago!!) they were
&gt; 145-145-145-160 so they've all come down al lot since then.  There is
&gt; 200,000 km on that engine.  Poor girl has a hard life in our arctic climate
&gt;

Doesn't seem so bad for an engine that's lived so long and in such harsh
conditions.  Just do what you can to be good to it.  If I were trying to
operate in Arctic conditions, I'd want an electric engine block heater,
Mobil 1 0w30 or 0w40 synthetic oil in the winter (don't switch to this
unless you're willing to spend time troubleshooting leaks), a thermostat
that works... and an oil temperature gauge.  Some Alaskan pilots use baffles
to block part of their airplanes' oil coolers in the winter, when the oil
would otherwise never get warm enough to lubricate properly; I'd probably
experiment with that if I found that the oil never reached normal operating
temperatures.
