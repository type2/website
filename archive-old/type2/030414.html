Volks, 

I would like to collect opinions.  I have two convictions in conflict and
am asking advice (PRIVATELY!!!)  I am concerned about posts advising of
items available on ebay.  On one hand, I am a strong proponent of not
killing subjects without multiple complaints, on the other, I am *very*
distressed by the whole concept of putting parts up for sale at ebay and
then announcing it here, as I am also a strong believer in volunteering to
help and share parts and/or knowledge whenever I can.  

The list has always allowed and, indeed, encouraged posts on vans for sale
and parts for sale by members to members.  In addition, I pass all
reasonable posts from non-members concerning such.  Beyond that, we have a
couple of commercial vendors who are members.  Ron (Bus Depot), Todd
(VolksWerks Transaxles), and others have offered and continue to offer
support, in addition to their commercial activities. Yes, they are in
business, but they love the hobby as well, and I do appreciate the
difference.  Many is the post from Ron or Todd that offers advice with no
hope of a sale in sight.

Somehow, there is a different &quot;taste&quot; to the ebay posts.  Pitting members
against each other in pursuit of necessary parts strikes me as wrong.  
Please write me privately with your opinions on this.  Do you want me to
pass on or moderate posts on items for sale on ebay?
