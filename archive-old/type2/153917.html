Subject: RE: [T2] Going Camping for the first time questions

David:  Sounds like you got a lot of things covered on your end.  The
suggestions from the list are good. I too have AAA.

I would also print off the section of the AIRS list.
(http://www.type2_dot_com/~airswork/rescue/index.html) just in case.  I would
bring a 6-pack of the local good barley-pop refreshment just incase your
AIRS rescuer needs a drink.  If you do not need it, have one for yourself!

I point out the AIRS list since no one has mentioned it. It's a good backup.
Many people have been saved.

Take care and have fun.  My son and I are off for a quick Friday the 13th
campout. He's 4.5 YO and cannot wait to go tonight....;)
