Subject: Re: [T2] electrical shorts

&gt;Remove ground lead from battery.  Connect an ammeter between the ground
&gt;lead and the battery terminal.  A tiny (&lt;~10ma) current might be needed to
&gt;keep the radio memory alive, but any more is bad.

To expand a little on what George said,  remove the fuses in the fusebox one 
at a time until the draw(ammetet) disappears).  Don't forget to turn off the 
dome light, and disconnect the clock if you have one.
