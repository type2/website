Subject: Auto tranny troubles

Auto trannies will leak overflow fluid from that area, unless someone else knows something more specific in that vicinity. If you overfilled it, that could be your source of leak. Don't forget to check fluid hot with engine running.

Anyone who knows about the why's of the leaking, please give your assistance.
