Subject: Bus Purring like a kitten!

Well, I just wanted to let everyone know that my bus is up and running!  
First of all I want to thank everyone who offered advice, comments and 
positive thinking.

H. Steven Dolan- for Tech advice
Meredith Murray- Inspiration
Jim Mowreader- for keeping a positive attitude
Everyone else who took the time to throw in their two-cents!

Today I learned something very valuable.  The past three days have been 
extremely intense as I checked and rechecked for TDC, compression, spark, 
fuel.  Asking for all VW Guru's to come to my aide.  I honestly thought I 
was going to go crazy.  What more did I need.  I had Spark, Fuel, Air, and 
what I just knew had to be TDC right on the timing mark.

Even though I got the engine started day before yesterday.  I was puzzled 
with the fact that the timing wasn't on the scale...It didn't backfire, it 
sounded pretty good...Still I couldn't deal not knowing or understanding why 
the Fan Pulley wasn't aligning properly. (not showing up on scale)

I gave up and decided I needed a second opinion.

Ouch! it cost me $200.00 for this lesson...But, for the piece of mind 
confirming I was not crazy, it was worth it...

I took it in explained everything that was happening...after three hours 
they called me (of course this shop has a policy for insurance reasons that 
you can't be in the bay area...)

I actually walked in the bay area anyway to talk to the mechanic.  He said 
he had to confirm TDC, valve adj., and that the rotor was facing the #1, 
which it was...Then, he noticed that the Fan Pulley was off a 914 porche.  
He R&amp;R the Fan Pulley and voila! The timing was only a couple degrees off.

I had no idea (lack of experience what the correct T4 pulley looked like) 
that I had the wrong pulley.  But, even worse, I had taken the  rat cage 
(lack of better words) off the back end of the entire housing during my 
detail clean up process.  The 914 fan pulley doesn't have a manufacture 
notch on the pulley, but rather on the housing portion is an embossed line 
(raised) that they time a porche by...So the mechanic explained.

The fan pulley was previous used on my original engine, but the P.O. 
(learning new &quot;list&quot; terms too)had notched it so good that I thought it was 
a manufactured notch.  MISTAKE ONE: When I removed the caged portion off the 
housing portion of the fan pulley to clean it, I didn't take note that notch 
(manufactured or not) should have been put back in the exact place.  When I 
put it back together I didn't put it back on the same place. The notch 
should have been placed in alignment with the steel dowel on the back of the 
fan housing.  The guide dowel used to align the fan pulley to the crank...  
the whole time I thought I had the pulley on right...I thought I knew when 
the timing mark was hitting the &quot;0&quot;, when actually I was turning it around 
1/4 of a pulley turn too much.

So, when I go tired of checking and rechecking and decided to turn the 
distributor until the engine cranked.  It cranked, but the timing mark was 
then 1/4 of a pulley length off the scale! But, timing was correct give or 
take a couple degrees.  The valves were a bit tight, he said not too bad.

I drove her home $200.00 less, but 200% happier.  Knowing that she wasn't 
going to blow up on me...

I have a few minor problems to get thru yet, but I feel like the worse is 
over.

I'm sure I'll be talking to the list more as I figure out a few wiring 
problems...Until then, Thanks again for being there to listen to all my 
problems.  I hope this lesson can be used by someone else in the future...

Lorraine
