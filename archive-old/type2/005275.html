Subject: SIDE TENT FOR BUS
Date: Tue, 24 Nov 1998 11:40:12 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi all,

Have not been on the list in a while.....bus I have decided to sell my side
tent and before it goes out to just anyone I thought I would offer it to the
list.  I am looking to get $600 for it.  It is in great shape and I have
everything except the original bag it came in.  All poles, canvas, stakes
etc.

If you are interested please email me directly.  You can see a picture of
the tent on my website

email me directly with any questions.

thanks


Joe
