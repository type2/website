I must've missed a few of these posts but caught the last one. I'll chime
in with my (feeble) analysis of this situation as I implemented it some
years ago and ask for broader advice.

I was heading into high altitude areas (10K feet plus) of the Wind River
range in WY in my '78 type2. We had noticed a very distinct lack of guts
as we neared 9K feet in northern New Mexico, so I felt some compensation
was called for. Reading Muir, I concluded that:
1- advancing timing would help. Muir suggests an amount, which I can't
recall at this instant.
2- burning lower octane fuel would help.

So I switched from 91 octane to 87 octane gas and advanced my timing about
5 degrees, from 7.5 degrees BTDC to about 12.5. Shortly thereafter, while
roaring up a steep forest service road in low gear at 10K feet, my
crankshaft broke in half. Fixing it, in a very remote place in a very VW
unfriendly part of the country, while on my honeymoon, is a whole 'nother
story I won't go into here.

My questions to the group:
1- analyze my above assumptions about fuel and timing. Are they true or
useful?
2- is there any reason to suspect that the broken crankshaft had anything
to do with my timing advance and altitude? I 've always assumed it was
just an unhappy coincidence, but I've never been sure of that.

Drive safely,
