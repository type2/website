Subject: returning to list; BNNTA

Hello list!
I'm back from a 9 month hiatus; got a few new projects to tell about; an
interesting GEX failure autopsy report; and I stopped in at BNNTA on
Sunday last and met a few list members in person:
David Swarze from Texas, Isaiah from Wisconsin, Rob, Terry, and Erin
from the Omaha VW Club (Rob determined that he used to be my brother's
mailman- small world, huh?)and saw a lot of pretty busses and just about
as many window air conditioners and one splitty with so many non stock
features that it could get into a record book or something (including a
RECOIL HAND STARTER that the owner claims always starts on the first
pull down to -10 F!!!)

56 single cab (not driven since 61)
