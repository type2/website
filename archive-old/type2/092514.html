&gt;All this talk about fuel filters has got me wondering.  How often SHOULD you
&gt;change the fuel filter on a fuel-injected bus?


Rule of thumb for an older FI vehicle, every 20,000 miles. The definitive 
(empirical) test is as follows.

Buy a new filter and have it handy. Clean then remove the tank side fitting 
and drain the gas into a clean container while shaking the filter to get 
most of the gas out. Now look in that container. If the gas is showing 
particulate matter either as grit settling on the bottom or dust like 
particles fogging the gas, put on the new filter. If it shows very little 
particulate, go ahead and remove it and drain it completely, then blow the 
rest of the gas out of it until it is virtually dry. Now blow through it in 
the direction of flow. Do the same to the new filter. Do you note much 
difference in resistance in the old filter compared to blowing through the 
new filter??? NO??? Put the old one back on and do another 10,000 miles and 
repeat. Yes??? Put on the new filter. Don't stress your fuel pump with a 
restrictive filter. Your pump will last indefinitely if you never make it 
work too hard trying to suck/blow through a resistive filter. Always 
replace it if you see even a tiny droplet of water.
