Subject: Friday/ 2 westy for sale DC area

Hello all,

I would normally wait til Friday to post this... but...  It's getting colder 
by the day and the time has come to limit the number of buses I have and buy 
a heated car that my wife will drive.  I have found said car for my wife, 
but need to raise the cash to buy it.  That's why I'm posting today.


I'm very reluctant to do this... I love my buses... but I also love my 
wife...

I have 2 westys for sale:

1973 Westy $800-ish (you know how it is)
The good:
I bought this bus for a project and really feel it has potential, for a 
daily driver and camper at least.
Engine has good compression 120-125 all around.
Canvas for the poptop is good.
Will make great daily driver, and is a reasonable candidate for restoration.
The not-so-good:
Some rust- rockers have a few holes, not huge, but there. Floor pans and 
other areas in good shape.
Sink/fridge missing, the rest of the cabinetry is there (not bolted down).
Child cot missing.
Right rear corner hit low. (Of course! Who's idea was it to put the cabinets 
there blocking the view anyway?). Could easily be pounded out.
Passenger door and slider door are from another bus... suggests some action 
on that side.
Gas tank is full of crud, bus currently runs off a pony keg tank.

1977 Westy $1,000-ish

The good:

All Westy gear is there 'cept the tables and it is all operational.  (not a 
deluxe).
Canvas is fair, with a couple quarter size holes that could easily be 
patched.
2.0 liter Fuel Injection - Strong motor and runs well. (My favorite thing 
about this bus) I can easily drive 70 MPH on the freeway and not feel like 
it's any big deal.

The not-so-good:

Kinda ugly. It's mostly orange with some grey primer spots and a brown 
slider door.
This bus has a lot of rust and I wouldn't consider trying to fix it. (I 
spoke with one guy in Baltimore who said he could do it, but he must be a 
gifted welder with determination). I have used all the chemicals I can to 
stop the rust and then seal it.

The upright portion of the axle beam on the driver's side is very rusty but 
has been re-enforced by welding in some pipe.

I must say that I love this bus and really don't want to sell it. In spite 
of it's rust it runs well and I love camping in it. If I kept it I would 
paint it up hippie style and try to keep it on the road as long as possible. 
Then if it died I would transfer all the Westy gear and the 2 liter to 
another bus.

I need to raise as close to &amp;1,800 as possible by selling these two buses. 
(The Suburban I want to buy for my wife is around that same price.)

If you are interested in either of these buses please email me at:

With a heavy heart,

Jeffrey
