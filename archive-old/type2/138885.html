Subject: True Canadian Winter Bus Campout - February 19-20th 2005

Hi Volks,

The_Bug_Pack has decided the date of the 2005 TCWBC. Just like last year it
will be held at Valens Conservation area, just North of Hamilton Ontario
Canada, on February 19th-20th, 2005.

TCWBC was concieved for the die-hard bus fanatic who's jonesing for a bus
campout and can no longer wait for winter to be over... But who doesn't have
the time or $$$ to trip south to Florida.

There will be Splitties, Bays and Vanagons. Eurovans are welcome too. There
will be snow.  There will be ice-fishing and winter hiking. If the
conditions allow there will be cross-country skiing. Sunset will come early
and dawn will be late. The group campfire starts early at the TCWBC and
doesn't end sooner than at any other campout, so there's lots of time to
relax and enjoy the fellowship of your fellow bus enthusiast.

This year we are to be honored with the attendance of bus-friends from West
Virginia and North Carolina. By booking early perhaps other of our American
friends may also be able to take advantage of discount air-fare... A Friday
pickup time at Buffalo International Airport will soon be arranged, so if
you're interested in flying in for the event and playing tourist in Toronto
please p-mail.

Happy trails,
