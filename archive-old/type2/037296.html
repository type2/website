Clark,

     Thanks.  If I was unsure about this bus's history I would be more
cautious.  I knew the people when they bought this bus in 1988.  I have
receipts dating back to the early 80's.  I have worked on it for them for
years.  When they were ready to sell, I was the first &amp; last call they had
to make.
