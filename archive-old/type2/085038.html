Subject: RE: &lt;FMBC&gt; bus sighting on TV

It is a re-run, but a darn good episode!  I think it was an early bay but
not certain.

I agree the quote about living in a Volkswagen was quite laughable...
Little do the overpaid and out of touch TV producers know that many people
have and are living quite comfortably out of VWs.

To each their own and I hope government would just leave me alone :)  Vote
Libertarian and piss off a democrat who is screaming for another &quot;program&quot;
to take all my money!

I dont know if it was a re-run or not,

but last night on &quot;Boston Public&quot; a drama on Fox, there was a bus scene.

the show is set in a high-school, and a teacher finds out that one of her 
students is homeless, she and her mother areliving in a Bus.  There is a 
scene where the teacher goes to find the bus, and then on several occasions 
the teacher trys to get other adults to help by saying............&quot;for god's

sake Stephen, she is living in a Volkswagen, a Volkswagen, she is living in 
a Volkswagen.&quot;

Wish I had it on tape :-)
