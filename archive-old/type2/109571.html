Subject: Re: [T2] Valves

You need to replace that valve immediately, before it removes itself from
your engine at operating speed (BOOM). The valve is stretching, or the seat
is pounding in. In either case, the head must come off to find the problem.

&gt; I just purchased a set of AVP heads a few months ago (June).  I've been
&gt; running them since July.  I have already dropped the engine again for the
3000
&gt; mile retorque.
