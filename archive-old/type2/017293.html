Subject: RE: Valve Seats (&amp; cooling flaps)

John, 

I agree with the conventional wisdom that you should keep the cooling
system in good working order. If everything is assembled properly, the
flaps will not stick shut. A failure in the thermostat or the cable will
cause the flaps to fail open, unless the spring is not hooked up or
you've got something seriously mutilated to the point they won't open
anyway.

I've heard the older Type4 engines had a history of dropping valve
seats, but there are those on the list that know better than I if this
is still a problem. I went with Mark Stephens for my heads because they
have historically had a reputation of building better than stock on
Type4 heads and they offer a good warranty. We'll see how they hold up.

-SNIP-
&gt; re-built* heads are not likely to have new seats. He gets his heads at
&gt; Mark Stephens which I would do, if I had not just paid to re-build my
&gt; heads.  Since they are on the engine, it's kinda hard to tell if they
-SNIP-
&gt;         Is a VW engine (81 Type IV-Vanagon) more likely to drop a seat
&gt; because it has seen a lot of miles? And if so - Why? One of the heads -SNIP-
&gt;         He also recommended leaving the thermostatically controlled flaps
&gt; out of the engine to flow more cooling air or trying them open to ensure
&gt; they are never stuck close? Comments-Advise-Please!
