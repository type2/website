Subject: for the tinkerers out there

For all you chronic tinkerers, there is a monthly
newspaper called &quot;Farm Show&quot; which is not about
VWs at all, but the sort of amazing things that
farmers build out of this and that.  One of my
favorites was a giant tricycle all welded up with
a Ford Focus engine and a winch driven seat lift
so that the farmer in question could drive through
mature corn fields inspecting his crop from above.

In any case, this month's issue points me (you) at
this site:  http://www.vegdvw_dot_com

If I am way OT, at least it is Friday.
