Subject: Warmin' it up

Philisophical question for the list:  what's best for warming our bus
engines up?  Muir's in favor, Detroit iron advice is against it.  I've
always wondered if they were against it just to microscopically boost your
gas mileage at the cost of wearing out the engine faster (and therefore
having to buy another car, sooner).  I would even go so far as to wonder if
there's any sense in figuring a way to pump oil under pressure through the
rotating motor BEFORE ignition (coil interrupt, or something like that).
This is not an idle question in the northern climes.  Comment?
