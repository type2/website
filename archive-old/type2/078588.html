This is exactly my original point and intention as regards Mr. Morgavo.

&gt;Imron at several hundred a gallon has got to be the most mind boggling
&gt;difficult paint to use....I pained a number of buses with the stuff. Big
&gt;buses not my VW...

Imron is a very good product, ( even for small buseslike yours, Bob :)

&gt;and then there is that paint that changes color as you look at it, I have
&gt;been told it is over a thousand dollars a gallon........a scratch in that
&gt;IS a crying event!!  wonder if anyone has ever painted a bus with that??

Dupont Chromalusions is the stuff- _at_ $3200.00 per gallon.
