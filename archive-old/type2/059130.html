Listees,

I'm having a time with my daughter's 71 Westy.  As soon as I think I've
fixed one thing, another trouble pops up.  I'm sure they're all related
somehow.

Almost as soon as she purchased it (about 45 days ago), her headlight
switch went bad (PO had replaced the correct switch with one that I
couldn't even find in the Bentley).  I got a new (used) one at a swap
meet and installed it.  Got her headlights back, BUT when the high beam
toggle on the turn signal is pulled, I have no lights at all.  Click the
toggle again and presto, the lights are back, just low beams, though.

We've also got something going on with the right rear parking
light/brake light.  The light comes on with the headlights, then of
course, both left and right go off with the above mentioned problem. 
The real kicker is that there is no brake light, flasher or turn signal
on the right side, but the parking light works.  This is almost as if
something isn't connected back there.  I can't find anything wired
differently from left to right sides.

All fuses are present and in good condition (replaced them all at the
time of purchase, just in case!).  No obvious loose wires or frayed
connections.  Cleaned and lightly sand papered all bulb bases, as well
as cleaning sockets.  What can I do?
I'm afraid it's something in the turn signal stalk - tell me it's not
so!

I welcome any and all help you can give me.
TIA,
Karen
