Subject: Re: [T2] New distributer

Dear Richard,

Drive pinion (I'll look that one up.....I am very new to this).....

Yes I have a type 4 engine....mark on the body for #1TDC...?......its
dark over here otherwise I would check right now.....

As to the wire order, I assume they are the same offset from #1 but #1
is simply in the new position due to the vaccum plate needing to be
rotated.

yours

Charles

p.s. Is that rotor on your site suitable, 5400 rpm limited.

&gt; &gt;So how do I determine the postition (angle) of the distributer. I have
&gt; &gt;an AP series 1800 engine....
&gt;
&gt; Timing light only.
&gt;
&gt; When you remove the old distributor you will leave the drive pinion in place
that will show you how to install the new one. Because the new vacuum can
distributors are for beetles the vacuum can is in a different spot if you have
a Type 4 engine.
&gt;
&gt; If this is the case, before removing the old one, set the rotor to point to
the mark on the body, #1 TDC.
&gt;
&gt; Then drop in the new one and you'll notice that you have to rotate the body
in order to get the vacuum can to clear the Type 4 fan shroud. The body will
move,only, the distributor rotor still points to #1 TDC, so that position now
becomes spark plug wire #1 (irrespective of the mark on the body) and the rest
wire, #4, #3, #2 clockwise.
&gt;
&gt; If you don't order the plug wires right, the engine won't fire or will
backfire.
