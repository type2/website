&gt;So I posted earlier that I am having problems starting the new engine in 
&gt;my 71 bus. I have a compufire installed in a 009 using a blue bosch coil. 
&gt;In attempting to troubleshoot why I don't seem to have a coil spark (I 
&gt;know there are 12v going into the coil) I was looking at my compufire, 
&gt;after putting in a different coil that while I don't know how strong it is 
&gt;I know that it worked for me about 3 months ago.
==========================&gt;
AA)
Did the engine fire and run with the presently used coil and a previously 
installed set of points in the presently used distributor?
BB)
Can you get the engine to run right now if you put a set of new points in 
the distributor?
CC)
If AA and BB are answered Yes,
then your Compufire installation remains as the only unknown in your &quot;fail 
to run&quot; results, and you now have a singular sense of focus to solve the 
problem.

I have installed perhaps a dozen or more Compufire ignition modules and the 
components have all fit together properly in the .009 distributors.

Make sure you hook up the red and black wires correctly to the proper coil 
terminals when attaching the two Compufire module wires to the coil.
