&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I have remembered that part of bus driving.  Hence my desire to move
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the spare to the front of the bus.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I don't think VW had that add-on in mind when they did their crash testing
&gt;
&gt; What crash testing, we are talking the semi dark ages here.

It was thought of, though.  the steering wheel mount of the baywindow is
designed to collapse in a frontal impact.  The bumper mounts were designed
to slide to take minor bumps (provided the bumper is repositioned after
that impact!)  The manufacturers were doing crash tests long before the
government got into the act.

&gt; then there are the exceptions, couple years ago a tractor trailer driver
&gt; fell asleep at the wheel on I-81 near Scranton, he drifted sideways
&gt; accross three lanes into my side, turned my bus sideways and hit the tire
&gt; mounted on the front with the side of his trailer near the rear
&gt; wheels...the imprint of his tandem rear wheels remain in my bumper and
&gt; tire cover to this day.....I was one lucky SOB as he didn't even break the
&gt; windshield, had I not had the tire on the front I probably would have been
&gt; pulled under the trailer into the rear wheels...and not speaking here
&gt; today

Every rule has exceptions.  My father would not be with us today if
seat belts were required in the '60s, as he lost a drag link and had the
top of his pickup cab sheared off level with the hood by a billboard as he
was hugging the stick shift on the floor.  Does this make me reject seat
belts?  Nope, because I realize that there are 100 ways to die by not
wearing seat belts versus 1 way to die by wearing seat belts.
