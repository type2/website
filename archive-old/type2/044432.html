I just wanted to say thanks to all of you who sent me info and urls!  The
Deluxe that's now on my desktop has garnered much attention and appreciation
by my coworkers.  I think, they now no longer think I'm crazy in regards to
my love of buses.  Just nuts, but with lots of character!

Thanks again!
