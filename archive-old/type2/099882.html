&gt;Muriatic acid is another name for hydrochloric acid, which is another name

&gt;know it.  It would buffer with the minerals in the soil and pretty much be
&gt;neutralized with time and rain.  After all, we do pour the stuff into
&gt;swimming pools and then jump in ourselves!

That's the way I looked at it but if you are really worried, neutralize the muratic acid with household baking soda before you dispose of it.  It's one way they clean up industrial acid spills.

HCL + NaHCO3 &lt;-&gt; H2CO3 + NaCl 

Anyone, please correct my chemistry. You get a salt and a weak carbonic acid. If you get the ratio of baking soda to acid right, bottoms up!

&gt;As a science teacher it scares me when people suggest experimenting with a
&gt;mixture of various cleaners or solvents.  I have no idea what is in
&gt;&quot;marine clean&quot; but I can think of lots of household chemicals that I
&gt;could mix with muriatic acid to produce a home version of Saddam's
&gt;chemical weapons.

Out of curiostity at the time, I looked up the MSDS on Marine clean and found out that it was microbial (yep, it eats the sludge). It's non-toxic and biodegradable and runner up for bus chemical of the year. Of course the award won't be allowed to have any VW logos on it. :-(
