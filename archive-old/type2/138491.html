Subject: Re: [T2] Gen light stays on -- goes out after engine revs

Jasper Z said:

&quot;but a quick rev of the engine (up to 1500rpm) turns the light off. Battery 
is getting 14 volts with the light off, and battery holds a good charge 
overnight.&quot;

Barry says:

I had my alternator checked at Advance Auto (free) and it showed an output 
of a solid 14 volts.  I was surprised.  Yes, the 'book' says the alternator 
should put out 14 volts, but I never read more than 13.4 volts being sent to 
the battery, even when the battery was low and I put ALL the drain I could 
on it (with the motor was already running, of course...)
