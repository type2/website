Subject: high idle speed on 77 F.I.

Help!  My 77 F.I. bus has a high idle speed and I can't figure out why.  I've
got the idle speed screw cranked all the way in and the idle is still 1500.  I
have the Bently manual and I went through their diagnostic chart.  The
auxiliary air regulator, decel valve, and fuel pressure are all good.  The oil
breather line is also good and the S tube is in good shape.  The EGR line is
plugged.  I also checked inside the throttle plate and it looks good.  I'm
stumped.  Anyone else have ideas?

Thanks,
Neal
