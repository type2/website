Subject: Re:Air Horn

Hi Listees,
    Air horns, now there's something I'd love to have on our bus!  I can see
2 long horns, one mounted on each side of the pop top, mounted so that they
are facing forward and the front of the horn is just a little aft of the
front of the pop top.  Then there'd be 2 short horns aimed aft with one
mounted on each side of the luggage rack.  The fronts would be plumbed
together, as would be the rears and each end of the bus would have it's own
button/switch.  The front facing horns would be to warn the traffic in front
of me of impending danger....like when the brakes or some other 30 year old
critical part fails.  Those rear facing horns would be to tell that jack#ss
who's driving way too close behind, who thinks I'm going so slow that I
shouldn't be allowed on the road, to BACK OFF.  But alas, my wife won't let
me do any of it.
    But to answer the question, sure air horns could be fitted to a bus.
The &quot;how&quot; depends on the horn and associated equipment.  Some are plumbed
directly to a small air compressor.  To &quot;honk&quot; the horn you press the
button, it runs the compressor, and the horn sounds.  Or the horn could be
plumbed to a small air tank which is kept up to pressure by a compressor.
To &quot;honk&quot; the horn you open an air valve that is spring loaded closed.  This
is similar to trucks, that already have air available for brakes and other
things.
