Subject: Baja Bus web site

Well since it's now Friday in Australia, and that's where I am, I thought
I'd give my Baja Bus website a plug.

You can check it out at http://www.baja_dot_com/kombi I'm really after some more
Baja Bus pictures and some more stories or technical articles also some
feedback on what you Bus guys and girls think.

And there's also my Wild VW site with V8 Buses and stuff like that at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Garage/1811 it's recently been updated
with a good tech article on welding body panels, written by a real pro,
which means it wasn't me ;)

Cheers

Steve
