Subject: Movie Double Cab &quot;Abusers&quot;

Last month I responded to a note posted on dropgates_dot_com looking for a Southern
California based double cab to rent for the movies.  Since I work all of 1.38
miles from home, I figured what the heck.  Rent it out, earn some fixup money
then buy the DVD and have my DC recorded for posterity.

I called, they came out looked, took a whole bunch of photos then called me back
today.

Rather than rent as they first spoke about, they want to &quot;buy the truck, abuse
it during the filming and then offer it back to the owner at a reduced price&quot;
after the filming.

I used the term &quot;Abusers&quot; in the subject line because that is what I was told
that they would do to the truck.  Abuse it.

I was told that they will have the stunt driver do some massive burnouts (a
splitty, yea right)
remove a side window so one of the actors can &quot;throw something out the window&quot;
The ironic thing is that my double cab can actually do a nice burnout in its
current built up condition.

I'm guessing a lot of it has to do with liability and wanting the artistic
freedom to do as they choose with the truck.  (I read, drive it off a cliff if
they so desire).

Did I ask how much they were willing to offer and what they would sell it back
at?  Nope.  I couldn't think about selling my truck which means there would be
an outside possiblity that it would not be back.

They said that they were looking at a couple other DCs in SoCal.  Anyone else on
the list considering their offer?
Anyone got a RUNNING (important), rusty hulk of a DC that's not worth much of
saving and want to make a few $$?, I'll turn you on to their phone number.

I posted this to the bay list also, since I'm sure they'd be happy with a bay.

Oh yea, the movie is Extreme Dating and the truck will be driven by actors who
are painters (five of them)
