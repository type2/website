Subject: Vacuum gauge help - thanks
Message-ID: &lt;371212CA.FE0AA97_at_fullcomp_dot_com.au&gt;

Thanks to the many people who've given me their ideas.

I've gone from mildly depressed to mildy relieved. General consensus is
&quot;that ain't too bad&quot;.

I've learned much and had fiddled a bit with the timing with the
mechanic who charged me A$140 to make it run worse than it was before -
got to get something extra for the money.  Trouble is he reckoned when
it arrived it was poorly tuned and running rich on the right two
cylinders with the idle set by the butterflies rather than the mixture
and in my guts I know he was right and No1 &amp; 2 plugs came out pretty
sooty before I took it to him.

I'll be patient and let the rings wear in more and a special thanks to
David for giving me the clue that made the penny drop.  When you
mentioned the compression ratio I suddenly remembered the blokes who
rebuilt the engine were saying that the old one was fitted with domed
pistons from a 1600 beetle and the higher compression ratio probably
rattled it to an early grave.  The new one no doubt isn't  fitted with
domed pistons and hence should have a lower compression ratio and a
correspondingly weaker 'suck' as well.  My mind is at peace for a while
now.  In a day or two it will want to figure out why it is still missing
a bit and just not running nice and smoothly (that's not a fish for
hints - at this stage anyway).

I originally bought the vacuum gauge after reading a book called 'Drive
it Forever' - full of hints to look after your beast and make it last.
By having an objective reading of how hard I have my foot down, I can
have the objective data I need to treat my bus kindly - I only ever drop
the gauge below 5&quot; to get out of a tight spot and another  bonus is the
difference in economy.  Less vacuum = lighter wallet.

One curious thing that it showed up was when you came to a hill, to
maintain the same level of vacuum you needed to back off the accelerator
gradually as you slowed down going up and on the downhill side you
needed to give it more as you sped up - a bit of a roller coaster
effect.

They have their down sides - sometimes you don't want to have this thing
staring you in the face saying &quot;Gee your pushing it a bit aren't you?&quot;
But another plus is it can tell you when things are getting out of
whack.  e.g. when I first picked up the bus after the rebuild and drove
it the 410km home, on a dead flat road in no wind if I set the gauge on
5&quot; I would get 96-98kph out of it.  After I picked it up when it'd been
tuned last time, On a dead flat road, no wind and 5&quot; I got 85kph out of
it. Handy to have that objective feedback but now my problem is I kinda
liked getting 98 out of it rather than 85 and I don't know if tuning it
like it was before is the answer.

No, I'm not selling them and I'll get out of your way now

FYI   judging by the feedback, 17&quot; at idle seems pretty bearable.

Thanks again.
