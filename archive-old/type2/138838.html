I think these are excellent. They look right, they fit right and are a
quality construction.

When I bought them at $35/ea there was no doubt they were worth it but with
the price increase some may choose to suffer a few sets of the cheaper ones
although everyone who seem to buy them regret it.

&gt; Given these choices, is the Hella worth the xtra $$$?  And what's up
&gt; with the red/white tail lens?

Euro.

&gt; Aren't they all amber/red/white?

US spec.
