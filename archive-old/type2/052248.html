Subject: [T2] Corvair engine + tranny for sale

Going to sell my Corvair engines.

- 110 HP, 164 cu in, LM - late model (post '64).

- 4 speed tranny for the same. 3.55 final gear ratio.

- EM (pre '65) engine, probably 80 HP.

Included is another 1/2 LM engine (heads, crank, case, rods - more or less 
entire engine).

I had originally purchased the EM parts for an engine swap for my '78 Westy 
then decided the LM engine was the right one for me, but it looks like I'm 
not going to get there anytime soon. Along came baby, mortgage, car 
payments, etc.

Still looks like a good conversion and after much hunting and asking, the 
LM 110 HP and 3.55 gearbox seemed like the best combo. Second place was the 
95 HP LM engine because it isn't as sensitive to overheating (lower 
compression).

The engine parts are still very easy to get through a good Corvair 
aftermarket so no problems there.

Both engines have generators, carbs, and full cooling systems.

I'm asking $200 for the LM engine and parts, and the tranny.

For the EM engine I'm asking $100.

They aren't eating anything so I could keep them, however who knows when 
I'll get around to using them...

Also available is a set of header pipes for a Corvair engine ($25) and a 
Corvair to VW transaxle adaptor plate ($50).

All are located in Cookeville, TN - midway between Knoxville, Nashville, 
and Chattanooga along I-40 in Tennessee. Well actually the EM motor is 
still in Chattanooga but I could relocate it to here.
