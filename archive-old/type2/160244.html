&gt; Does anyone make or know someone who makes a T adapter for oil

Most people are using an extension hose and relocating the sender. If  
you use the dual pole VDO sender you can do away with the original  
warning switch although the warning pressure is slightly different.

I haven't seen a tee that rises through the Type 4 tin and lets you  
mount both. You might have to buy two pieces unless you get something  
custom made. For example, in this photo...

...you can see a brass VDO adapter. I believe the male fitting is  
1/8&quot;-27-NPT so you'd need a longer version of this adapter:

Hopefully someone has a simpler solution and a supplier you can call.
