Hello to all of you!

My name is Jenny and I am the co-owner of the Westhaus Garage (the other
co-owner is my husband, yannick). many of our client e-mailed and called
us to let us know their was a lot ok talking about us in the mailing
list, concerning the &quot;link' located at the bottom of our web page. Since
we are very (and i mean it!) busy having fun repairing westies, we don't
have much time to read every digest every day. But from what I have been
told, I guess I have some explaining to do.. ;0)

We opened this garage almost a year ago (June 1st!). About 6 months
agon, a good client of our offered us to create our own web page. So he
did, giving us a little space on his own web page (I suppose you would
call him &quot;a host&quot;). This client has a lot of family in the Kosovo area
and I guess the war really affected him. But HIS beleives ARE NOT ours!
Period. It might seem stupid but I really thought people would make a
difference between a personnel page and a commercial site. I don't have
to tell you that I now know that I was deeply wrong.... Obviously, somme
people think that we (including all french-canadians!) are racists and
etc...

Just like I said, we DO NOT share HIS opinions. They have NOTHING to do
with us or our garage!! We are just ordinary people working on the
coolest and funniest vehicule on earth. As bus owners (we have a 71
Sportsmobile and a 79 bus), we like too much people and traveling to
worry about politics and/or frontiers of any kind.

I will do something about this link tonight... and if you have any
questions about this issue, please, feel free to contact us. We'll be
happy to clarifie this situation.

Peace (and excuse my poor english!)

Jenny (and Yannick)
