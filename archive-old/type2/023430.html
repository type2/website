Hey all--
           It's entirely possible that I will be in Italy and Switzerland in
late May/early June...without the bus, unfortunately...but if there are any
listees on that side of the pond that like good blues music (and will show
me some of those prize-winning European versions of our beloved bussses) I
would love to hook up, as I'll be playing my way back and forth across the
Alps---e-mail me for details...
           On the other hand, I got some pics up on my website I think all
would appreciate...I looked down at the floor of my garage and saw this nice
composition:   http://www.snave.20m_dot_com/images/vwstilllife.jpg
(OK, so I placed a few of the objects)...

and here is a pic of DILLIGAD  :  http://www.snave.20m_dot_com/images/bus1.jpg

                                               Happy Friday!!
