Subject: Re: Muir Bashing (was Engine Hesitation)

Muir bashing, that's not very nice. despite the believes that Muir held, I
have yet to find an automotive book that teaches people everything they
need to know about their car, and more importantly what they need to get
them home in case they get stranded. I agree with Paul in that i never work
on a vw unless i have Muir's and a workshop manual by my side, but the muir
book has more than any manual can offer.

i guess i responded to this post cause i just bought Muir's book again as a
gift to my girlfriend who just got a beetle.  I want her to get what i got
out of that book, the confindence and knowledge that I can fix my vw, and
that i have to depend on no one. without that book i wouldn't have had the
confidence i needed to rip my old bus apart and put it back together. I say
all this cause if there are any newbies out there who don't own this book,
and don't know what's going on in the back of your vw, then buy it.  that
book has taught me everything i needed to learn when i had no one else to
teach me. sure bently and chiltons are great, but they don't teach you how
a car works.

so, bash all you want. my oil and brake-fluid-stained muir book will always
ride with me.
