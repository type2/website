Hi Volks,

Last week a list-member who was asking about roof racks for kayaks, so I
have put together a guide on how build your own simple racks.

In fact, I went completely nuts, and created a 5-page guidebook on the job.
Color photos and technical illustrations make this a must-have for those who
would rather not drag a trailer along behind them while they pursue their
need for &quot;off-road&quot; entertainment. And using Adobe acrobat PDF format means
the file is a thrifty 248 KB download.

You'll need the adobe acrobat reader to view the file, if you don't have it
already you can download it free from www.adobe_dot_com.

Enjoy,

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
