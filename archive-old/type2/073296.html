Subject: Synthetic Oil

Well it seem like billv2_at_prodigy_dot_net was posting about manual transmission
oil and not engine oil.

I was hoping on finding info about the stuff you put in your engine.

Archives were not much help.

So:

  I was wondering if synthetic oil is an option for my bus.

  I have 2500 miles on a rebuild.

  And what about additives, like Dura-lube or Slick 50?

Please tell me more.

&gt;&lt;&lt; Good news for Montana volks. I just found a supplier of Redline products in
&gt; Kalispell. They carry Redline MTL GL4 synthetic. The place is Terry's Small
&gt; Engine 406-752-1016. I just ordered 4 quarts _at_ $7.95/qt. Terry is sold on
&gt; Redline products and uses it for racing and snowmobiles plus other auto
&gt; applications. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;i hate to exploite something, but this is an excellent opportunity,  so
&gt;without mentioning brand names and getting into a * my brand is better than
&gt;your brand * FART then i will just say that if you are interested in an
&gt;extremely top of the line synthetic oil, that has never been beaten in any
&gt;independent lab, or road test EVER  then email me and i ll send you a catalog
&gt;for FREE  and you can order it yourself  warehouse direct at a better than
&gt;redline price for a twice as good product.  interested???????
