&gt; OK, so I've watched numerous dumpings on the ol' 9, which never gives ME any
&gt; trouble except this:
&gt; I have a 1600 singleport w/ doghouse, 009, monza exhaust and a Brosol Solex
&gt; H30/31PICT1 carb. Timing is set at 10.5 on the pulley. I seem to run cool,
&gt; no pinging except REALLY steep hills, idles at 950, decent power, small
&gt;  stumble at second, 18 mpg. Which is low. And I suspect the mpg is low because
&gt; no matter WHAT I do, the thing runs pretty rich - to the point that gas fumes
&gt; outta the exhaust will set yer eyes ta burning. Which makes tinkering a joy.
&gt; I have also had a german solex (34 pict 2 if i remember) and a JAPANESE
&gt; solex(?!)(dumped it fast - LEAKED), so I don't think it's a carb-specific
&gt; prob, but maybe a synergy thing? Is there a carb/distributor combo that
&gt; would be better for my 71 Salina?
&gt; Or is it something else entirely?

I'm running a 71 case, 1600 DP. The heads (new 040s) have been *hemi*
cut using BERG cutters at my local mach. shop. This gives me a CR of
6.8:1. With that CR I use a *total* timing advance of 36 degrees with a
30 PICT-1 carb; 120 main, 60 idle, &amp; 145 air correction. By todays
standards, this is a little rich. BUT, I don't heat up, don't ping, it
really pulls and gives me 22 mpg in my 61.

I have also used the Brosol Solex H30/31PICT1 carb on this engine with
great results. This carb is now on by 68 T2 with an 009 where it works
great.

The 009 is a good dist. You just can't throw it into any old engine with
any old carb. and expect it to work well.
