Glad you found the list ok Charlie. 

In addition to the idiot book, get Wilson's book &quot;How to rebuild a VW&quot; from
JC Whitney for around $15. Pretty indespensible bible for undertaking a
rebuild. Also get a copy of VW Trends and /or Hot VW's for all of their
display adds to get a feeling for parts costs.  Here's a useful hint since
you're in Atlanta: Nopi will be your best parts source and they are cheaper
if you mail order from across town rather than buy across the counter.
