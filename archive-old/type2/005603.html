Phillip-
The symptoms you describe are most likely not related to
the points, but could easily be caused by accidently changing
the order of ignition wires, either in the distributor cap, or at
the spark plugs.

&gt;I just finished putting a new set of points and a condenser in my 76 Westy.
&gt;I used the article from the technical library as a reference.  Everything
&gt;went OK except for the fact that I can't keep it running long enough to
&gt;adjust the timing.  I adjusted the points gap to .016 and have been playing
&gt;around with the width but nothing seems to work.  I can get the thing
&gt;started but it runs extremely rough and I have to keep giving it gas for it
&gt;to stay running.  I can't keep it running long enough to check the timing
&gt;with a scope.  Any suggestions?  I am new at this so please be descriptive.
&gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt;Phillip Freund
