Subject: SCCA autocrossing buses

&gt;Has anyone here ever AutoCrossed their Volkswagen Transporter or
 &gt;Westfalia? Just curious. &gt;&gt;

OK....not exactly but we used to run our buses at the Old BUG-INs in orange 
county in the slalom races !

My friend had a green 54 barndoor panel lowered with a bug gearbox (no 
reduction gears) and a built Type 3 motor

lots of fun , but they killed the slalom because they needed the space for 
the drag racing pits !
