Subject: Tranny Questions for the Wee Morn.

Morning!

Well as per my previous post, the engine is out, and the input shaft *was* 
sliding out :-(

So I've been told that this is a circlip that holds this piece in. Here are 
my questions:

1. Repair or Replace, I am kinding leaning to replace, when I drove the bus 
home from the PO's place, I noticed that even with the clutch depressed the 
bus seemed to be &quot;dragging&quot; but not apparently because of the clutch. I've 
also noticed that the tranny is covered in thick goo. I am betting that if I 
check the fluid level I'll be in for a big surprise.

2. How difficult to repair? Can it be done in the bus?

3. Replace, someone in this bus' lifetime someone welded the shift linkage 
cage in place :-( So I am stuck as to removing the old cage. I am thinking of 
breaking out the drummel and going to town with some cutting disks. (I 
already have the new one in hand)

Thanks as always, this is a great and helpful list. All of you people are 
wonderful.

Tyler.
