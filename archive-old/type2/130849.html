Subject: gas cap blues

I have been fighting gas caps on my 1986 Brazilian DC for the last 
several months.  Most recently I purchased a cap off ebay from a seller 
in Mexico.  Crapola.  This weekend my family and Stephen Black went on 
a 1,500 km bus cruise.  Stephen had a very nice gas cap on his late bay 
westy.  It was nice and heavy.  It looked a lot like my black plastic 
cap, but was much heavier and sealed much better.  The major 
difference, aside from these facts, is that Stephen's cap must be 
screwed on and then locked with the key.  My gas cap is pressed on the 
filler neck and then the key is turned causing it to hold itself in 
position...not all that well.  Stephen indicated his cap was a Bus 
Depot cap.  When I got on this evening, their $15 cap seems a lot like 
mine.  Can anyone verify that this cap turns on and then locks?

I need a good gas cap.  I searched the archives and found a couple 
leads, but they turned up a couple dead links.

Please help if you can!

Thanks,
mjr
