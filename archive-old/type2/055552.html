Subject: Re: Excessive Valve Noise

&gt; 
&gt; Today was tune up day. It has only been about 1000 miles since my last
&gt; valve adjustment, and about 100 miles since timing/dwell adjustment. So I
&gt; got out the trusty tools and feeler gauges and measures everything. My
&gt; motor is a type IV, and the label and others say to adjust both intake and
&gt; exhaust to .006&quot;. I go about finding the right adjustment by tightening the
&gt; adjust screw onto to feeler gauge until the gauges metal curls, just a
&gt; little. I check for tightness by wiggling the feeler. It should drag
&gt; decently. 

I would disagree slightly.  First, the general school of thought here on
the list says, for Type 4 engine, .006&quot; for intake valves, .008&quot; for
exhaust valves.  Secondly, your technique.  I like to get the cylinder
to TDC, then push the rocker arms in at the pushrod end to take up all
the slack.  Then I try to get my feeler gauge in.  If it's out of
adjustment, I loosen the locknut, do the adjustment, and then check it
again with the feeler gauge, tighten the locknut, and check it once
again.  Make sure to take the slack out of the rocker each time before
you check it.  You should be getting a SLIGHT drag on the feeler gauge,
not a heavy drag.  It should slide through with a hint of drag.  Better
too loose than too tight.


&gt; So me's setting these crazy valves, noting which ones are making it a habit
&gt; to get tight (the engine only has 6000 miles on it, so I've only adjusted
&gt; the valves a few times yet . . .). All goes smoothly, adjustment done in
&gt; about 15 minutes, a record for me. I check a few other things, like the
&gt; points gap, staying at .016&quot; like I was told to do by Sean Bartnick (Hi
&gt; Sean!) and a few others.

I've changed my recommendation.  I have found through experimentation
that a point gap of .018&quot; gives a MUCH BETTER dwell reading than .016&quot;
and is pretty much right on with VW's recommended dwell spec.  I guess I
need to revise my procedure.  I now say .018&quot;!


&gt; Later, I check all four sets a valves again, starting with four, the three,
&gt; then two, then one. Three was a little loose on the intake, so I reset it
&gt; again. All other were correct, and I made sure everything was tight. Nuber
&gt; two intake was also loose, so I reset that also. Tight is everything. Snap
&gt; the covers on, start her up. It's still there. I let her run, yep, the
&gt; noise is certainly valve related, and loud as hell. Before I only heard it
&gt; on the drivers side (left), but it was also coming from the passengers.
&gt; 
&gt; And here I am. It's now dark and cold (go figure in Colorado). I have
&gt; always heard valve noise from my engine, ever since it was a new engine
&gt; (6000 miles ago). It always got a _lot_ quieter after a valve adjust. I've
&gt; used the same method every time. And I don't get it.

You did properly set the engine to TDC on the compression stroke each
time, right?


&gt; 
&gt; For further Info, I turn the engine by hand, well tool, using the
&gt; alternator nut. I spin it clockwise only, and use timing marks on the fan
&gt; to tell me where the cam is, and verify it by looking at the direction of
&gt; the rotor, which also turns clockwise. Firing order is 1-4-3-2. Or is it
&gt; 1-3-4-2? D*mn, I can't remember. It's too dark to go out and look at the
&gt; cap. Anyway, I know it, I just forgot ;-)
&gt;
Firing order is 1-4-3-2, which is why you want to turn the engine
backwards to do the valves, as it becomes 1-2-3-4 and this allows you to
do the valves on each side right after each other rather than switching
back and forth.


&gt; Is everything correct?
&gt; 
&gt; In the past few miles, I have been having a hard time telling the differece
&gt; between mechanical noise and an exhaust leak. I know my exhaust leaks a
&gt; little bit more every day, but sometimes I swear it's ticking at me. It
&gt; doeas change with engine speed, but so does the exhaust noise. Maybe I'm
&gt; just being paranoid, but I don't want anything to happen to my baby.
&gt;

I don't know about your noise but it sounds like generally you're doing
the valve adjustment right, given that you are properly setting the
engine to TDC before adjustment.  Since I can't hear the noise I don't
know what it might be.

Good luck
