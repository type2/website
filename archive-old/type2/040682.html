Subject: bus engine blues(soon to be fixed)

hi, I am a newer poster on this list and was wondering if you guys could
tell me how to fix or adjust my carb and or starter so that my bus will
actually start and idle.  I think I have two separate problems that are
slightly related.  First off is the starter/starting.  If i go out to my
car after it has been sitting a day or two it starts right up and idles
well with no problems.  If i start it up like that and then take a short
trip(5min) then try starting it again right after the short trip it
takes longer to start.  And every time i take a ride then stop it takes
longer and longer to start.  I guess it could obviously be that i am not
giving the generator(1971 bus) enough time to top off the battery.  But
i don't think it should take as long as it does to start up.  I recently
did a valve adjustment, timing adjustment, checked point gap and set the
idle to about 1000rpm(850 was too low).  Could i need a new starter? a
new battery--or bigger battery to compensate for the several start ups,
oe what.

problem two:
like I said i recently set the idle to around (+/-25rpm) 1000rpm and
when you start it up cold and let it idle it will do so pretty well.  If
you start it up-let it warm up-then drive for a while then stop and
leave it in neutral parked the engine will shut off unless you &quot;tickle&quot;
the gas every 5-10sec.  I think this is a common problem with the older
carbs.  I have been told that you can do very little about it except
touch the gas at a light to keep it going, or get a new carb.  I would
get a new carb but i am only 16
years old and don t make too much money so the new carb would have to
wait.  Right now i want to make the bus more reliable because if the
engine dies at a light it doesn't start sometimes even though i know the
battery is charged from a long trip right before.    Sorry about the
long post, but i really want to make my car more reliable.  I think that
this is what i should do.  Please correct me since i am probably not
choosing the best route to reliable driving.

I think i need to:
1. get a huge battery to help with the slow starts
2. get a new carb eventually
3. turn up the idle and waste gas for the time being
4. What Else?      any replies will be greatly appreciated.
