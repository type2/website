Subject: ball joint - oversized??

bus depot sells two ball joints, one of them is listed as :

Front Ball Joint - Upper &amp; Lower Oversize (48.5mm)

and the other :

Front Ball Joint, Upper &amp; Lower, Std. Size (48.2mm)

What would you need an oversize balljoint for?
(they are cheaper!)

oh, and are german in this case better? Ive seen someone on eHay selling all
four for $40+shipping, but I think they are from Brazil. I know its usually 
best to
go german for most of these things, I should do the same for this right?
