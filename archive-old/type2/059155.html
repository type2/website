Subject: Re: Trouble along the way... 

This sounds painfully familiar...
	Several years ago a friend of mine drove a '65 through a fairly large
ditch on a beach in Mexico... I don't know where, exactly, except that
it was fairly near AZ...? Anyways... he had similar symptoms like Fred's
motor did: the smoke, loss of power, oil burning, etc. 
	It took him a case and a half of oil to get from there back to
Flagstaff, where it sat until I gave him another engine to use on the
condition that I would receive the toasted one as a core. Since I am/was
in tennessee, this involved several rides from friends with space to
haul VW motors... 
	I rigged up the bellhousing/starter jig and tested the compression...
zip in #2, the rest were fine. The #2 piston had a hole burned through
it at the bottom; the metal near the void kind of looked like it was
getting ready to follow suit and pour itself into the case. 
	The cause? Sadly, it appeared that the 1-2 air deflector had become
dislodged (perhaps by the force delivered by driving through the ditch,
which gets larger and larger in the telling as time goes by...) and
fallen down on the pushrod tubes, allowing the overheating condition.
The other deflector had been safety-wired to the cylinders and had not
suffered the same fate. 
	I keep the piston on the mantel as a daily reminder to always safety
wire the deflectors in place.
	so... similar yet different. Anyways, I hope Fred is on the road again
without further incident, in a timely manner.

&gt; The hole is on the &quot;under&quot; side of the piston, above the top ring land and

&gt; at the piston held vertically in your hand, the hole is a couple of inches
&gt; from side to side.  There's quite a bit of missing metal, some of which is
&gt; smeared/welded to the adjacent surface of the cylinder bore.-
