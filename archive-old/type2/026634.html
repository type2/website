Depending on the year...You can order reprinted manuals and supplements from
http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/  they differ in price but mostly around
$20.00   Watch your credit card bill though...don't know if it was a
clerical error or computer goof up, but I just found out they charged me
twice....going to give them a call about it...but I did get what I ordered
and it was very nice... I'll be ordering copies for my '72 if they get
around to printing them.  :)

Patrick
