&gt;............Incidently, I have a big radiator fan in one of my cars fused

&gt;locks up and burns out, and an 80 amp circuit breaker will blow if that 
&gt;happens. I could probably get away with a 60 amp circuit breaker. I just 
&gt;want to avoid having it blow when the fan starts up and is a peak current 
&gt;draw in the first instant of operation. Big fans use a lot of current and 
&gt;you need to measure that current and then pick a big enough feed wire (and 
&gt;a big enough ground wire) and an adequate fuse that will give you a safety 
&gt;factor.

This is good advice, and just what Mike should do.  Instead of guessing at 
the fuse size, measure the current that the fans draw and pick 
appropriately sized wire and fuse(s).  I have a large fan in my &quot;other&quot; car 
too, and it really does draw 80 amps at startup!  I measured it.  And 21 
amps continuously.  Blows those little black Bosch relays (rated 40 amp) in 
short order.

&gt; &gt;But when both are wired -
&gt; &gt;blammo after a few minutes.

Sounds like you have them wired in parallel which means each fan only has 
to draw 4 amps to blow the fuse.  From the looks of those fans I'd say they 
could easily draw 4 or more amps so that is likely your problem.

&gt;Also this malfunction SEEMS to be tied into
&gt; &gt;revving the engine. If I rev it up they will blow but only after revving for
&gt; &gt;a minute of so.

This could easily be caused by the extra volt or so that your electrical 
system sees when the generator/alternator is revved up.  That means extra 
power (V*A) through the fuse and a greater likelyhood that it will blow if 
it is marginally rated.
