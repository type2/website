Subject: Auburn Hills-Long Trip-Long Trip Report

Dear Folks,

Gus and I drove into our driveway about 6 p.m. yesterday evening tired but
very happy. We had a wonderful trip up to Detroit and Auburn Hills and have
lots of news about the Great Bus Tour and all the neat people involved which
will appear on the Tour web page as soon as I can get the stuff together in
some good fashion.

First, I'd like to thank H. Steve Dolan who made the grueling trip from
Alexandria VA to Auburn Hills just to deliver the Hubcap and Tour Box so
they would be there in time for the Show. If he hadn't made the effort we
wouldn't have had much to show off. We had a great time Saturday getting
things ready and meeting everyone at the tail gate party which was more like
a &quot;so this is the place!&quot; and a &quot;so that's what you look like...nice bus&quot;
party.

I'd also like to thank John Hartranft for all the time he put in making the
really neat banner (lots of admiring comments, John) and the name tags
(everybody wanted one of those!) and for helping me put up the booth and
&quot;man-uh person-uh, bus it&quot; during the show.

I got an e-mail (alas, the day I left for Detroit) from Sally Farhat of the
Detroit Free Press saying that she wanted my phone number to talk to me
about the Tour and that she was doing a write up for Monday's paper.
Rats!!!! Talk about a missed opportunity! The good news is that at least a
photographer showed up anyway. I didn't talk to Sally, but I e-mailed her
when I got home and found her note to me. If anyone saw an article about
the Tour or about the Show in Monday's Free Press, please let me know!

Okay, now for the Atlanta to Cincinnati leg:

Gus and I left around 9 a.m. Thursday morning galloping along in the warm
sunshine up I-75. Just north of Resaca, GA a bus load of guys passed us. We
all waved madly like long lost friends or maybe just a vanishing breed. If
that was any of you guys, let me know! The bus was a cream colored camper
with Floyd County plates and it was the ONLY one we saw on the road during
the whole 1400 mile trip.

The day started out fairly cool and Gus was in a good mood so we made good
time up 75 through Georgia which we've done many times and so was
unremarkable except for our happy memories of visiting with the Peach State
Transporters last February at their winter campout just west of 75 in
Cloudland Canyon. We sailed through Chattanooga and sang the usual song and
headed up toward Knoxville Tennessee and waved in Chris Slaymaker's
direction sorry I had missed his call the previous day (hope you made it out
of the Atlanta traffic okay!).

Gus and I don't like to stop when we're trying to make time and distance but
we sure slowed down when we hit northern Tennessee and Kentucky. It's true
that it's almost all up hill there, but it is very beautiful too! The
mountains were so green and lush and the air was so cool and sweet we didn't
want to hurry. There were very few billboards and little to impair the
exquisite loveliness of the area. Gus and I traveled slowly enough to really
be able to see a lot and with the window down we heard snatches of sweet
birdsong and peepers &quot;singing&quot; in the hollows. You don't get that at 70 mph
with the windows rolled up!

Another temptation threw itself in our path in the form of shale deposits in
the road cuts. They are a fossil hunter's paradise (take's one to know one,
right?) and only time constraints kept Gus and I from shuffling through
layer after layer of geologic history. Save that for another trip.

We passed Ashland, the home of Henry Clay, the firebrand secessionist  who,
legend has it, changed his mind about breaking the Union when visited by the
ghost of George Washington who showed him the evil mark on Clay's right hand
and warned him that he would wear that mark forever if he succeeded in
destroying what so many had suffered and sacrificed for. Clay abruptly
stopped his agitation but the secessionist won out anyway and the rest is
history.

We finally stopped for lunch (both busly and human) around 3 that afternoon
in Williamsburg Kentucky. The nice lady at the Subway Sandwich place at the
gas station searched through the quarters she had and gave us what we need
to complete our state quarter collection (we are so easily amused) so
feeling well stuffed and triumphant, we decided to hoof it on to Cinci.

We descended the far side of the mountains into a torpid river valley still
green but very hot but we pressed on to the Ohio River and &quot;made camp&quot; just
south of Cincinnati in Florence Kentucky vowing to visit the &quot;Big Lots&quot; the
next day to get the human a seat pad so she wouldn't stick to the seat next
time and to also get the extension cord and plate holder she forgot to get
in Atlanta before she left. Some people!!!

Anyhow this is getting way too long so there will be more later on Cinci to
Detroit!
