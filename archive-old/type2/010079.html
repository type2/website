Hi all,
   Since I'll be on the road on friday, I'd like to take this opportunity to 
thank Tom Riis for his help.  I was in need of a part, and Tom was nice 
enough to send me an extra one that he had.  And to top it off, he didn't 
want any money for the part or the postage.
   I don't know Tom, we've never met, but he helped me out anyway.  Let it 
be known in all of type2 land that Tom is a kind and generous man.   THANKS 
TOM !
   That's the great thing about this list and all of you.  A whole community 
of people helping each other just because.
