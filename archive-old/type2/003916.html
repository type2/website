Subject: No power, loosing oil

Just had my bus out of the shop again, they found a vacume leak, it seemed
to have more power but when I took it this weekend it lost it and then some.
Going up just little hills I had to go into 2nd gear and do 25, that is as
fast as I could go.
I noticed when I got home the I burnt half a quart of oil in 300 miles but I
don't have any oil burning coming out my tailpipe.
It almost seems like I am only running on 3 pistons, how can I tell?

1976 bus
Fuel Injection
2 litre
Just tuned up
compression 120-130 all around

Where is my power and my oil?

It almost seems useless to go back to a mechanic but does anyone know of a
good one in Portland Oregon?

Thanks

Bob
