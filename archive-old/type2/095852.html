Subject: RE: [T2] (F) Barbie gets a bus!

Does that mean there is no hope of buying one without becoming one of the
facelsss million &quot;trendy&quot; folks, like new beetle or PT Cruiser owners???

(To those that own new beetles or PT Cruisers- I'm mostly kidding
To those that don't - I'm serious! Really!)

&gt;Happy Friday, all. While shopping in the local toy shop for a friend's
&gt;kid's birthday present, I noticed that while the new VW bus has not
&gt;been released to the Dealers, our good friend Barbie can already get
&gt;one.

Barbie(tm) is always the first to own the newest, shiniest, fashion
accessory fad.
