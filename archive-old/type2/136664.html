Subject: Re: [T2] Don't forget to order clutch alignment tool!

&gt; &gt;I can still move the disk with a screwdriver or dowel. Move it a little,
&gt; &gt;eyeball it to see if everything lines up and when you're sure you've got it
&gt; &gt;positioned right, finish tightening down the bolts.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW, I've found that a 3/8&quot; drive 10mm deepwell socket on an extension
&gt; works really well for this.

i have always just used the back end of my 3/8 ratchet (which is round)
and just visually centered it.
