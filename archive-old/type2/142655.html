Subject: Re; Parcel Trays

Here's what I did for a parcel tray in my 74 Westy.
I picked up the phone, and called the Bus Boy's.

It looks like the original available accessory, it's easy to install,
and it saves a bunch in time and aggravation screwing around making a
hodge podge &quot; &quot;home brew&quot; unit. 

I looked around for a long time and this parcel tray in my opinion if
the nicest unit you could install. 

The rest of the available trays from other vendor's are really cheesy
looking, and not built really well.

Take a look over at the Bus Boys if you guys are seeking  a real nice
parcel tray, that looks like it belongs there.
