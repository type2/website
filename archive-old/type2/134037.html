Thank you ROB for the quick reply!
Yes it is the Eberspacher vent you're talking about. And I still have the  
heater. But when I bought the bus, the Eberspacher's combustion chamber  
was filled with about 1kg of rust and soot, so I took it out to clean it  
up, and haven't found the time to clean it further and test it yet, but  
plan on doing that soon...
