Subject: Re: [T2] T-shirt take 2

I personally think Ebay is the greatest thing since pasturized milk, and has
saved me a huge amount of money, gas, and time looking for stuff, and
finding stuff that would never be available locally, but if the group has an
Ebay is verboten rule, I apologize profusely for my ignorance, and prostrate
myself in shame before the assemblage...

&gt; i guess it was the very public nature of ebay and the quantity of posts.
&gt; of course if someone needs something and you see it on ebay, a pmail would
&gt; be appreciated im sure.
&gt; the other thing is the samba is operated by a vintage list member, everett
&gt; is one of us. if it became like ebay we might vote to exclude the posts
&gt; though.
