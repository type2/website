Subject: 78 champagne


All this talk about paint jobs.....

I got a quote on my 78 Champagen edition this weekend and am thinking 
seriously about doing it.  The quote is from a local guy who has painted 
about half the cars that are in the local club.

The only problem he has though, are the 3 stripes around the bottom of the 
bus.  He says that finding some that are as wide(about 2&quot;) as what the 
stock ones are is going to be difficult.

Any one else have/solved this problem?

Cheers, dave
