Hiya All,

I'm a Bus newbie.  
I've had my 70 Station Wagon for about a month now.  I need a little advice 
concerning body repair on one of these guys.  
The PO had installed a front spare tire mount.  Apparently there wasn't 
enough clearance for the spare tire he was mounting and that has resulted in 
a large somewhat shallow dent in the front end.  It almost as if he mounted 
the spare with no air and then inflated it which distorted the sheet metal.
Common sense tells me that this &quot;dent&quot; is way too big for any kind of body 
filler (at least the way it is now), so what kind of options should I be 
considering?  Are there any VW Bus body tricks or tips I should know before I 
(shudder) head on out to the local body shops?

Thanks!
Mike
