&gt; Hey Don, I have a similar situation with my Bus. The

&gt; a fan motor in there 
&gt; either (didn't come with the car). It also appears
&gt; as thoug my Bus might 
&gt; have had A/C at one point because part of the sheet
&gt; metal on the drivers 
&gt; side of the rear most part of the engine compartment
&gt; was cut away (right

You ought to seal the holes and the cutaway - I agree
with Don, except I like pop rivets! His way is more
easily reversible. Consider also that cooling air
comes out of the bottom left and right sides of the
fan housing into the heat exchangers. If the heat
exchangers are beyond repair / never going to be used
then you might consider duct taping those trap doors
shut also (Not the main flaps!) This will provide
better cooling to the engine. -BaH
