Subject: vac can on dizzie

	My 1600 DP has a dizzie from a '71 beetle (thanx 
decoder-demons of T2 list).  The vacuum can on the side is not 
working  -  sucking on its input does not move the dizzie baseplate, 
and I can hear air leaking, presumably past a breach in the internal 
diaphragm.
	There is no crimped-ver rim such as some other vac cans have. 
It's far from apparent how to dismantle it.  I assume that, once I 
get at the diaphragm, or most of its area, I can glue in some 
membrane.
	Has anyone dismantled this 'sealed' unit please?
