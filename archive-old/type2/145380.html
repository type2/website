Subject: Re: [T2] k&amp;n air filter

&gt; Here is an interesting test of K&amp;N against other filters. Granted, the base subject was a Chevrolet filter,

&gt; I would love to see REAL results to contradict this, NOT seat-of-the-pants BS like 'It felt more powerfull'
&gt; crap.

Gauze filters are a bit of religious argument.

When I was racing motorcycles off-road I used K&amp;N filters.  The reasons I
used them were:

1. They wouldn't clog up and stop the bike from running, resulting in a
DNF.
2. K&amp;N paid a nice contingency prize if I happened to place well.

Now, this was a racing situation where I was running a 2-stroke engine
that was rebuilt on a fairly frequent basis.  I was willing to trade
increased engine wear for a virtual guarantee that the bike would
ocntinue to run in the short term.

For my street-driven cars I wouldn't run a K&amp;N on a bet.  They let a lot
of small particulates through.  In the short term this is not a problem,
but the long term effects are not good.

Now, a lot of folks will say &quot;I run a K&amp;N and I've gone 100K miles with no
problem.&quot;  They are telling the truth.  If you stay out of dusty
environments you could probably go 100K miles with no filter at all.

For a VW bus with the air intake at the rear of the vehicle I would
definitely not recommend the K&amp;N.  The proper stock filter is best.
