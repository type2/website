&gt;Never seen in captivity but the word is that very early 1968 factory high top buses had metal roofs instead of the fiberglass that replaced it to the end of the run in 1979.

As I found out from a snotty guy at Jerome a few years ago, ALL factory high top busses have metal roofs.  The fiberglass ones were all added on by aftermarket companies.  The model I saw was a 72 &quot;ambulance&quot; and had partitions behind the front seats that extended all the way to the ceiling (creating a walkthrough &quot;doorway&quot;) and a metal (euro) dashboard.

This gent became very indignant when I told him I also had a high top bus.  &quot;No you don't, what you have is a CAMPER&quot;.  Ooo-kay, whatever...
