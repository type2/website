Subject: re alternator
Content-Disposition: inline

As the topic of alternators has come up I want to post a question.  My 78
2.0 does not charge at idle.  Once I am running along on the highway the
rate of charge is _at_14v.  I have replaced the Alternator (had it retested
3X), Regulator (replaced 2x), belt is tight, ground on tranny replaced,
battery was replaced, battery cables cleaned.   Yet still I have this
problem.  When I am running with the lights, heater, radio all on the
battery is really getting drained.  Even at speed with all of the
accessories on it is draining the battery.  Is this normal?   Also the
alternator light never goes out.  Even when 14v (no accessories on) are
going to the battery it stays on.  I checked the wiring, and it is all OE
and intact.  I just really cannot figure this one out.  Any help on this
would be appreciated, With colder weather happening I would really like to
turn on the heat and the lights when sitting in traffic.  Otherwise I might
need to travel with my dog on my lap just to keep me warm..

Thanks for any help
Graham
