Subject: Woe is me....

Well I dropped by Buggy World yesterday to arrange having Buster towed 
in. The guy asked me what was wrong with it. I explained how the starter 
went out and it was making a racket and the puttering sound it made 
before that when it was sorta running and he tells me I sucked a valve, 
mentioned something about the heads, showed me another buses engine he 
was working on and tells me yours is the same as this one. Then he kills 
me with &quot;it will be about $4,000 to fix it&quot;.

I just thanked him and turned around and walked out. All that without 
even looking at it. So what do I do now? I can't tow the bus all over 
town, but unless I know for sure what's wrong I don't know if I can 
afford to even have it fixed. If it's that much I'll just have to sell 
him. The worst thing is, Buster is parked at my apartment building I 
moved out of 2 weeks ago and I can't bring him to my new place so I 
don't know what to do about it now.


Any suggestions oh wise ones?
