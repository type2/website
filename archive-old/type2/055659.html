Subject: re theft!!

Melissa &amp; I are now into our 2nd decade of doing vw collectibles.the
rate of stealing at ALL the shows we attend is soaring!!in just 2 west
coast shows we did one was a theft of early vw
literature--$1500--lost---at the next same show $750 in models!!-lost!!
even catching the culperts does nothing! unless i file charges and come
back to the state their attorney just gets a delay!! early convert deck
lids,nos semiphores,roof racks,steering wheels,swamp coolers,and on and
on,---this was not the case 15 years ago!! why??
even a round tool kit!! that could have only been taken by another
dealer due to the gates still being closed to the public!!and still
people think with very small minds that we are making a lot of money
doing this!!~ we do this because we are VW people and enjoy the 99.999%
VW friends that make it worth the work, I'm sure a lot of other VW
.sellers feel the same as we do.
