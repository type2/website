Subject: RE: Tires for 74 Westy

&gt;      Along this line, what is the biggest tire practical on these
&gt; buses? As I recall on my earlier bus, getting bigger rims is a problem
&gt; because the bus has offset rims to keep the tire under the body and
&gt; inside the rear wheel arch of the body.
&gt;       Has anyone found good rims (like 7&quot;-8&quot; wide) that  do fit? And
&gt; what's the biggest tire that fits and doesn't rub on bumps?

	I've got a 75 camper and am running 15x7&quot; wheels on the back with
235/75/15 (about 9.5&quot;x29&quot;) and these fit just fine.  The wheel is a custom
made steel wheel.  If you wan't offset's and stuff I'm sure I can find them.
They cost about $120AUD each.  The fronts are 15x7 running a 205/75/15.
Both of these tires are LT All terrain tires and I've found them really good
and will get me almost anywhere.

	Oh, and nothing rubs anywhere.
