Subject: Ordering Mexican parts

        Jay,
        VW dealer in Tijuana parts desk is helpful, friendly, bilingual
and able to look stuff up. Cashier takes VISA cards.
        What they cannot do is ship parts to you in USA. We asked. They
also can't sell or give you a parts catalog :( Next time I'll try
to get the part number of their Fiche set though :)

        Best they could offer us would be we place order and return to
pick-up in person. I dearly wanted one of their spin-on-oil-filter
adaptors, but none were in stock. I think they thought Ian and I were
a little flakey, but we bought $300 worth of stuff, T2 turnsignal lenses and
a complete electronic ignition for a carbureted beetle ($85 for a NEW
distributor... not a bad deal!).

        We flew Southwest Airlines to San Diego, took the trolley
to the border, walked across, asked the nice Visitors Bureau lady
where the dealer was (we had an address) and followed the map. Its
about a 2 mile walk from the border. A cheap taxi ride if you don't
wank to walk, or have a lot of boxes. We took a back pack and declared
our contents at US Customs, they weren't interested... could have had
$4K worth of Weber carbs in the bag, but they didn't even ask us to stop.
Who knows if they'd look in a box of upholstry...

        Bill
