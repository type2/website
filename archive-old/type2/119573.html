Subject: Re: [T2] Tires in storage?!

&lt;&lt; Which brings me finally to my question. I've noticed that whenever I've
parked a car (like in my garage for an extended period of time, a year or
two), or I've seen a car that's been sitting for a while, the tires begin
to crack and dry out. These tires that came on this 97 GT are fairly
expensive tires, about $130 dollars for a single tire. How can I store
them, so that they won't dry out or crack? I'd likely be keeping them in
my garage, or at the very least, a shed.
 &gt;&gt;

I'm not sure if it's mandated yet in Europe, but tires will eventually carry
expiration dates here in the USA...For precisely that reason; use 'em or
not the rubber does age and become unsafe...I &quot;think&quot; the UK MOT tests
might even include this already in addition to the tread depth testing...
Anybody in the UK up on this...?
As for storage...Best I've heard is on their side in a dark (no sunlight!)
not too dry space. High performance tires with a softer tread compound
(and faster tread wear) probably suffer more from age than a harder
(and longer lasting) compound...
Short of storing them in a climate controlled, inert gas filled container,
I can't see any solution to long term storage (Don't laugh, such capsules
are available for that Bugatti Atalante you only take out for the Pebble
Beach Show...).
