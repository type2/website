Subject: big clutch problem

Before we replaces our clutch disc, our 72' would grind when it was in gear,
and it ws very hard to get into gear too. when we looked at our disc, the
asbestos wasnt letting the rivots grind (we had at least 2mm) but all of the
springs were loose. when i held the middle piece that the drive shaft goes
through, it wiggled and wasnt nice and solidly stable like in the one we
replaced it with.  so we replace our engine and after driving it not 20 min
with our replaced disc, it starts to grind and is hard to get into gears,
the exact way it was before. so im thinking that ther emight be somehting
that could be causing my disc to get this way. i will probably be taking out
my engine in a few days to see if the disc is in the same shape as the first
one. hope someone has some much needed knowledge on this.   ----NONNY
