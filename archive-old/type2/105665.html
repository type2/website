&gt; My 75 has a paint can lid type access lit in the engine compartment just
&gt; ahead of the battery and just above the wheel well. Pops off with a

&gt; lots of patients and small arms and hands. Not sure if the 72 has the
&gt; same arrangement.

Only the FI busses have the paint can lid. That area is open on older busses
and I think some models had the charcoal canister mounted there.

&gt; Also.  Fuel pump is weeping a drip of gas every so often.  Any sources for a

This question came up on another list and I looked through my catalogs and
couldn't find a rebuild kit. I think the fuel pump changed to a partially
serviceable design. Perhaps Ron has a Pierburg catalog and can uncover the
details. A gasket appears to be available (021 198 311A).
