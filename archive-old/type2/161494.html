Subject: Parts engine

I am slowly disabling a complete parts engine (74, dual carb, automatic
trans - I believe)  It had been sitting out of the vehicle for some
time.

I finally got the exhaust off.  The heater boxes are mostly gone, but
the muffler looks like it was a fairly new replacement.  Some of the
studs came completely out the others just sheared right off.  It has a
part number &quot;ERNST D22188 made in Germany&quot; stamped on it.  I think it
would be a good spare/future replacement if I could thread some new
studs in it.  Any idea where to find the studs and what size they are?

Also surprisingly I found a relay in the heater box that had at one
point must have fallen down the fan tube - part number VW 211-963-141.
The only reference I could find was that it is a 12v relay not sure for
what.  Any ideas?

One final question - is there only way to test the mechanical fuel pump
other then putting it on a bus and going for it?
