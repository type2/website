&gt;I would be willing to bet that the old head you took off and the new

Well, maybe I can replace the bad valve in the old head, have it cleaned 
up, and swap back.  I'm getting good at taking the engine out and putting 
it back

&gt;First triple check that you have the plug wires connected correctly,
&gt;since you have spark, chances are except for the possibilty of having
&gt;the wires out of order you are ok there. Honestly I would pull off all
&gt;of the wires, and start from there. It will make you think through the
&gt;entire process again and not just agree with any mistakes you made.
&gt;... good luck and update us with any addition findings.

Ok, I think you got it right.  I pulled all the wires when replacing the 
spark plugs, and just like magic it ran.  I think I had the 1/2 and 3/4 
wires backwards.  So now it runs, but not that well.  Actually, it drives 
pretty well, but doesn't idle.  But the real issue is that there is a lot 
of vapor coming from the crankcase ventilation system.  Next to the oil 
filler there is a tube that runs up and is connected to the air 
filter.  There's quite a bit of smoke coming out of the air filter.  Also, 
this tube continues down and vents to the tin.  It is dripping oil onto the 
tin and smoking up the neighborhood.  I'll try and get some pictures 
tomorrow.
