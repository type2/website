Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix report

I (unlike Dolan, who apparently loves to set dwell) put the pertronix
in my bus a few months ago. Love the results. My dwell was also high,
but I thought about it. So, the only reason you don't want a higher
than necessary dwell is so your points don't burn up, right? Well, w/
the elec ignition there are no points. Hopefully all we end up doing
is give the coil a slightly longer time to build up a larger magnetic
field to collapse &amp; give us a better spark at the plug. Haven't
worried about it since.

&gt; The plastic feeler gauge they give you seems to set the dwell on the high

&gt; using a larger feeler gauge to get the dwell right (Ken's Buggy Barn):

&gt; It's too bad you have to mess with this at all but I guess that's what the
&gt; Ignitor II was all about (I couldn't determine if it worked with my
&gt; distributor and coil). I'll try adjusting the dwell again in the morning.
&gt; At least it will be way easily to play with now that I don't have to align
&gt; the rotor with the distributor body, etc.
