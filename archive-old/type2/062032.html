The Inuvik Run - Frenchman's Lake

July 27

0831, Saturday, 27 July 1996

I'm still in Whitehorse.

I've been on the road 9 days, traveled 3,090 miles.  The sun set
about 2230 last evening but it did not grow dark until 0200.  By
0500 the sun was on the rise and so was I.  I walked off the
kinks through the sleeping town.  Saw what might have been a
coyote slipping across the deserted street.  Hiked back to the
bus, made coffee, sat down to write this.  

Whitehorse is sleeping now but it is a bustling place during
normal working hours.  With a good airport and seaport (Skagway),
and astraddle the only all-weather highway between Alaska and
anywhere else, plus a ready-made attraction for tourists, it is a
busy, interesting place to be.  That is, to be at.  Most of the
towns I've visited during this trip are places you yearn to be
from.

At Frenchman's Lake

In Whitehorse Dennis said he wanted to work on his bus, having
asked the loan of a few of my tools.  I waited around for him. 
And waited.  And waited.  Finally said to hell with it.  

I pulled out of Whitehorse about 1330, drove to Carmacks, hung a
right and arrived at Frenchman's Lake in time for supper.   The
rest of the group were already there. 

Jorge has suffered an extensive first degree burn on his face and
right hand, the result of coaxing wet wood alight with a dose of
gasoline.  There are some small areas of second degree on his
fingers and nostrils.  He's playing it very cool.  Or very
stupid.  He could of turned back to Watson Lake or stopped at the
mine's clinic at Faro but chose to do neither.  Macho-dumb.  

I mixed up some electrolyte replenisher and got him to drink it
then instructed Yvette in how best to keep the burns clean,
giving her my supply of sterile cotton pads.  She is stressed out
by the situation.  Yvette has no experience with a manual
transmission; she can not take over as driver should Jorge become
incapacitated.

Except for Jack Stafford, who camps with Jorge &amp; Yvette, most
everyone else treats Jorge's burns as a joke, offering home
remedies along with barbed comments at his expense, as if the
issue were the use of gasoline as a fire-starter rather than the
possibility of Jorge's permanent injury, or being forced to
abandon the trip.  I'm chilled by such casual disregard for
another human.  

Some of the others want to continue their off-pavement odyssey
but I've talked Jorge and Jack into accompanying me on the more
direct -- and paved -- road to Dawson, hoping to get Jorge some
medical attention before his burns become infected.  With the
material I have it is impossible to bandage his burns so as to
completely exclude the road dust.  Despite Yvettes frequent and
devoted efforts to clean the burns they will become infected if he
does not receive some antibiotics.

It's a little after ten in the evening.  Dennis and Ron arrived a
short time ago.  Ron sez his lap-top is working again.  I
wouldn't trust the thing as a door stop.

Later...

Rather than work on his vehicle in Whitehorse, Dennis signed on
the queue for internet access at the Whitehorse library, then
went gold-panning, then bought some tires, then...  did something
else, all while I'm sitting around with my thumb up my ass,
thinking he's going to need my tools.  He does, but obviously
only at his convenience.  He's just borrowed some -- and my
picnic table -- and is fabricating a missing piece of engine tin. 
But without my help.  I've been up nearly eighteen hours.  Going
to bed.  If he keeps me awake I'm going to mistake him for a bear
and take appropriate action.
