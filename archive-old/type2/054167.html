Subject: RE: Generator Light Glows

Hi all,
   Someone recently wrote;
&quot;On my 61, yesterday the generator light started acting up... its wierd.  At 
low RPM's the light is off.  As soon as i get to highway spped its glowing 
softly.  As soon as the rpms drop, it goes off again.  the bus appears to be 
charging just fine, its wierd for sure.&quot;

Well the first thing I would look at is the generator brushes and springs.  
To me it sounds like the brushes are starting to float at high speeds.  That 
is to say, that they are not making good contact with the generator 
armature. This could be because they are worn down and/or the srings don't 
push them down hard enough.
Just my 2 cents worth
