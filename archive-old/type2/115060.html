Subject: Fuel tank cover

Just wondering how one can remove the insulation panels on the top of the
engine compartment on a 72.  I9m trying to get at the nuts that hold the top
of the fuel tank cover on.  The panels seem to be held up by rivets or
something.  My 72 does not have the 3access panel2 that other lucky folks
have.

Thanks,
Ed
