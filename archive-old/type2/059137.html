Subject: Trouble along the way... Part 2:  Elation and disaster

I went East over Chinook Pass, even though it's much higher than Snoqualmie 
Pass and I-90, because it's much shorter to Yakima than Snoqualmie and because 
it's sheltered from the wind until the summit.  Reports said it was blowing 
30MPH down Snoqualmie Pass and all the way through Ellensburg to Yakima.  
Traffic was light, I joined I-82 at Yakima, and the trip was going 
beautifully.  

I got all the way to the Columbia River and into Oregon near Hermiston when 
the power just went away.  No noise, just like someone turned down a rheostat 
on an electric motor.  I hit the shoulder of I-84 and looked for trouble, but 
the engine room was clean
(no oil spray) and the engine was barely warm.  I cranked it up and it was 
obvious that I'd lost a cylinder from the sound and the lack of power.

As I started to move on the shoulder toward a distant interchange and truck 
stop the smoke came rolling out the back.  At this point I thought the oil 
cooler had blown, or blown a seal, in addition to whatever caused the power 
loss.  After 5 miles of chugging along the oil light flickered and I shut her 
down.  Down 2 quarts in 5 miles!  Oil everywhere in the engine room and coming 
out the exhaust pipe, but the engine was still only warm.  I topped up the oil 
and limped up the ramp to the truck stop.  The engine wouldn't idle at all and 
would barely haul me up the offramp at full throttle in 2nd gear.

My long anticipated journey to Union OR and Catherine Creek State Park had 
ended at Stanfield OR and the Pilot Travel Center at the junction of I-84 and 
US 395.

After looking everything over again I reluctantly called Jim Arnott in Union, 
still 100 miles away.  His daughter answered the phone, then drove 15 minutes 
up the road to get Jim at Catherine Creek State Park.  We discussed the 
problem, and he said he'd be at the truck stop in the morning (Saturday) with 
a friend to rescue me.  I spent the night in the camper at the truck stop, and 
Jim and Pat Owen showed up Saturday AM as promised.  Things were looking a lot 
less gloomy already.

They quickly determined that #3 had 0 compression, and that the valves on #3 
and #4 were all tight.  Re-adjusting the valves brought some power back on 
line and the engine would idle again, so apparently I was actually running on 
2 or 2 1/2 cylinders as I arrived at the truck stop Friday evening.  It seemed 
crystal clear that #3 piston was holed, and that was about the only part they 
weren't prepared to replace on the spot.

After much discussion and several calls to the engine builder (another long 
story there) the final decision was to stock up on lots of oil (assuming a 
loss of 2 qts. every 5 miles) and try to nurse it back to Tacoma.  We removed 
the oil filler cap to reduce crankcase pressure in the hope that would reduce 
the oil loss rate a bit.  The engine room was already dripping with oil, so it 
didn't matter much at that point which way it sprayed.

Jim and Pat urged me to take I-94 West to Portland, then I-5 North to Tacoma.  
We hashed over all the possibilities, including the worst case scenario of the 
engine seizing up en route and stranding me far from help.  Jim made several 
calls to list members in the region, and got through to Jack Maynard in 
Corvallis OR.  Jack in turn supplied contact information for others along the 
way.  

Because of previous experience with long distance travel in a 3-cylinder Type 
2, and being familiar with the various route options, I decided to try working 
my way back up the Yakima Valley to Yakima WA.  The lay of the land is 
relatively flat on this route, and it would minimize the mileage traveled and 
exposure to urban area traffic.  Once there I could re-assess the situation 
and decide whether to attempt a Cascade Mountains crossing, and which pass to 
use.
