&gt; I'm having trouble on the internet finding the proper battery for my 1977
&gt; type 2 campmobile.  I believe that I need to get a Type 42 for the starting
&gt; battery, but wanted to make sure before I go drop my cash on the wrong one.
&gt; My battery is now only holding around 9.5 to 10.5 volts in the cold so it
&gt; has to be replaced.

The OEM size is 41 (at least with the 70A alternator).

Look in this table under Imported 12v to see the rough differences between
42 and 41:

Make a trip to the library and read the last few Consumer Reports; one of
them had report on batteries if you are concerned about brand.
