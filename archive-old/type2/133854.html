&gt; Stop.  Take a deep breath.  i posted about this a few months ago.  I have
&gt; done this successfully.  Take the pump cover to a machine shop and have them
&gt; remove the entire lip on the pump cover.  What you end up with is a flat
&gt; piece of steel with the 4 holes for the studs.  Then you put it on and the
&gt; moustache bar fits no problem.
&gt; 

This cover plate can be bought new as a flat plate , Matter of fact I haven't 
seen any of the old style covers new anymore  . Why pay for machine work and 
still have an old cover?   Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import
