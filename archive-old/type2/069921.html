My '65 bus has a new starter, new coil, new battery, new distributor, new
everything except ignition switch and it starts sometimes, sometimes it
doesn't.
So I'm thinking it's the ignition switch. Any thoughts on this? Anyone have
any
ideas to help me? Anyone have an ignition switch or connections to get one
because no one sells them. Any advise would be great. Keep on bussin'.

no- it's prolly in a bad connection-  you can test the switch by hot wiring
the bus, but i wouldnt bother.  there is tons on this in the archives
clara.
