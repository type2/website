Subject: Engine Bay Lid

Heh everyone:
     About 1 month ago my bus (79 Westy) was rear-ended while parked on the
side of the road. The engine bay lid  was damaged beyond repair.  I just
went by the auto body shop so the guy could show me what the replacement
parts my mechanic had provided. I have two engine bay doors to choose from.
One is real rusted and the other is not much better. Government insurance
in my province won't pay for the complete reconditioning of the part, they
only allow for so much to be spent on a &quot;used&quot; part. This leaves me with
two choices. Pick the better of the two and have them do what they can with
it, or provide a source for an  alternate part on my own. I understand that
this part can no longer be acquired new (at least that is what several VW
parts suppliers in Canada and the US have stated), So my question to the
list is does anyone have or no where I can get a real nice used Engine Bay
Lid for a 79 Westy?

Thanks
