&gt;I was in Sears the other day and saw a splittie bus (loosely defined) in a
&gt;toy package.  It's a Li'l Brats toy package.  It's a splittie about 12&quot; or
&gt;so long.  The roof comes off to become a disco dance floor...

I saw a commercial for the Li'l Brats toys, and the Splittie is visable.  I 
told my wife that my 2 1/2 yr. old daughter needs these dolls 
:-)  Although, since I own a Bay, I'm not sure I can risk her going over to 
the dark side.  She needs a toy Bay, something that looks like the &quot;magic 
bus&quot;, as she calls it.
