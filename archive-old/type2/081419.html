THIS is baloney. I know guys that have them on their street cars, getting
over 30mpg.

for a low buck daily driver I wouldn't use them, but they ARE very
streetable, don't spread myths, we have enough of them already.

&gt; 48 IDA's are way to big for any street car.  You can try it all you want,
&gt; but you will spend a fortune jetting and re-jetting....................
&gt;
&gt; All the motors you mentioned from the VW rags are
&gt; hot-rods..................They are not daily drivers.  The people that own
&gt; these take them off a trailer at the shows and probably drag them.
&gt;
&gt; Much better off to get carbs that are close to the size you need to start
&gt; with.  Those 48's look impressive, but few cars can use them, and even
fewer
&gt; people have the patience, money and experience to tune them right.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Tim,
&gt; &gt; I got your email &amp; was quite interested to hear you say that IDAs are a
3
&gt; throat carb.
&gt; &gt; Yet through my fairly wide reading of magazines like Hot VW's, VW Trends
&amp;
&gt; Total VW I've found a number of Cal Look bugs that apparently run IDA's &amp;
48
&gt; IDA's at that.
&gt; &gt; I'll refer to page 50 of the November 2000 edition of Hot VW's featuring
a
&gt; blue 65 Type1 with a 1915cc engine &amp; twin 48 IDA's.
&gt; &gt; Or perhaps the 54 Oval featured on page 48 in this year's February
edition
&gt; of Hot VW's running a 1835cc with twin 48 IDA's.
&gt; &gt; And perhaps you'd like to tell Frenchy Dehoux of all people that when he
&gt; built this car he was building a engine that wouldn't even run &amp; would
&gt; &quot;flood the plugs before you could get them to fire on initial startup&quot;.
&gt; &gt; You might also want to tell him that the 36mm venturis he's running are
&gt; way wrong as well.
&gt; &gt; Or perhaps take a look in the same edition at Geoff Hart's 10 second
&gt; 2332cc equipped 59 Sunroof bug that runs bored our 52mm IDA's with 46mm
&gt; venturis.
&gt; &gt; This last one is maybe a bit much because it's practically a drag car,
has
&gt; no back seat, spindle front wheels &amp; a full rollcage.
&gt; &gt; My point is that IDA's are alive &amp; well on VW's &amp; providing amazing
&gt; results.
&gt; &gt; Oh, &amp; your point on Marvel Mystery Oil.
&gt; &gt; In a tech article on rebuilding Weber &amp; Dellorto carbs sponsored by CB
&gt; Perfromance in again the same edition readers are advised to use either
&gt; Liquid Wrench or.......surprise, surprise....Marvel Mystery Oil &amp; the
&gt; technical staff actually used the Marvel product.
&gt; &gt; I'm sure your methods are excellent Tim &amp; your years of experience has
&gt; fine tuned the way you build &amp; maintain engines.
&gt; &gt; But it doesn't mean you have the right to be so condemning or
patronising
&gt; just because you feel one of us has no idea about what we're talking
aboutin
&gt; your superior wisdom.
&gt; &gt; There's more than one way to skin a cat.
&gt; &gt; I sent the previous email because I didn't know that much but knew
enough
&gt; to think the question was worth asking.
&gt; &gt; My final question before I pull my head back into my shell is are IDA's
&gt; dual of triple throat?
&gt; &gt; Please enlighten me.
&gt; &gt; Cheers

&gt; is a dual throat. Even so, fabricating a manifold
&gt; &gt; to run a single IDA to both heads would require a big bunch of
&gt; &gt; skill/time/money. It would be an experiment, so if such experimentation
is
&gt; &gt; of value to you, pursue it, and let us know your results.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Tim,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;If you found the right manifold for it, couldn't you run the 48 IDA as
a
&gt; &gt; &gt;single carb though?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I know of no such animal. No engineer I know of in the world has thought
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; worthwhile to make up a three throat carb to two port head manifold for
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; IDA's. Sure, it could be done theoretically. With several thousand
dollars
&gt; &gt; worth of skilled engineering and custom prototyping, you can do
anything.
&gt; &gt; If it works well, you might even be able to demonstrate it and sell it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyhow, there's plenty of Cal Look Beetles running a pair of these with
&gt; &gt; &gt;admittedly large engines.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'll bet those are IDF's, not IDA's. Very different kettle of fish.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Surely if you happened upon another one you could fit it to a Type4
style
&gt; &gt; &gt;engine?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; IDA's are 3 throat carbs. IDF's are dual throat. IDA's are for 6
cylinder
&gt; &gt; Porsches and V-12 Ferraris, though like I said, if you wanted to try to
&gt; &gt; engineer a manifold to adapt them to a two port head, experiment on,
&gt; &gt; McDuff, as long as your are funding this experiment.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;What does everyone think?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm not impugning your know-how or experience, Tim, but I like to see
&gt; some
&gt; &gt; &gt;original solutions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A pair of 48 IDA's would drown a T-IV motor unless you figured out how
to
&gt; &gt; build it to well over 3 liters and ran it over 5000 rpm at all times. It
&gt; &gt; sure as hell would not be anything like a street drivable engine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Note that the venturie that would work well on a 2.0l IDF motor are like
&gt; &gt; 32mm tops. That would be 32mmX4 for something that fits the application.
&gt; &gt; Now compare 48X6 to feed the same motor. Get the idea??? You would flood
&gt; &gt; the plugs before you could get them to fire on initial startup even if
you
&gt; &gt; spent gross amounts of time/money/skill to develop/fabricate the
manifolds
&gt; &gt; from scratch.
