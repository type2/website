Subject: Re: NEW Bus

If VW does bring back the 60s style bus they should use Steve Stanfords
designs.  They're the best.  But what would it be called &quot;The New
Kombi&quot;. &quot;The New Tranporter&quot;?
-------------------------------------------

They reffered to it as the new Microbus.

BTW, what are Steve Stanfords designs?
