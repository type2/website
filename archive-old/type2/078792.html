&gt; &gt; Comment on the fuel pump being inside the tank- yes it's common to
&gt; &gt; modern cars; we paid $400 to have it replaced in a Nissan Quest/aka
&gt; &gt; Mercury Villager, because of the labor involved.  Another downside is
&gt; &gt; how do you keep rust and other tank contaminants from affecting  the
&gt; &gt; pump?  You can't change a filter in the tank!
&gt;
&gt; This is very true, and is one of the reasons they've been using plastic fuel
&gt; tanks in new cars for quite a while. No rust!

The advantage to having the pump in the tank is that you eliminate vapor
lock.  The entire fuel system is under pressure, so gas bubbles cannot
form.

The pump-in-tank does have a filter.  It usually takes the form of a
screen around the inlet, much the same as our VWs.  Yes, you have to pull
the pump to clean the filter.

Plastic fuel tanks are nothing new.  Off-road racing motorcycles have been
using them since the '70s.  They don't crack or rust, and if protected
from the sun they seem to last forever.
