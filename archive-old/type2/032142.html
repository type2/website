Subject: Busses that beg to be searched... (Tire mount content, too)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.95.990507163516.10515A-100000_at_mallard2&gt;

There is a bus I have seen driving around my area  (Alabama, at that)
that has a great big marijuana  (er, Hemp) leaf on their front mounted
tire cover . It also has &quot;The Hemp Seed&quot; on the side.  Apparently it's
a hemp-wear business vehicle.  I do wonder if the drivers have a
particular need to be hassled by the man or what?  I admire their courage.
I question their sanity.

By the way, their spare tire mount is NOT attached to the sheet metal, but
is instead held up by something that clamps to their bumper.  Very
interesting device. No modifications, yet the tire is out of the way.
The sheet metal would still absorb any impact though...

p.s.)  Of all the cubbyholes in the westy, a well trained dog or
persistent cop is going to find your stash.  Nothing beats the
security of keeping ones stash tucked securely in ones undies (Boxer
wearers take caution, YMMV).  Ah lighthearted Friday!
