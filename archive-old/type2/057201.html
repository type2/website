Subject: FS - '78 Westy

Hello listees-

Due to an surprise addition to our VW family, I'm having to sell our '78
Westy. It's complete, but is not running. (I think I tracked it down to a
hydraulic lifter that came apart.) The engine is all there, but sitting in
my living room. I'll sell it as is, if someone wants to rebuild, or I am
going to replace the bad lifter and put it all back together again. Other
specs: complete interior, good canvas(but no windows), minor rust (battery
tray, little under windshield, some under jalousie windows). It's avacado
green, with that groovy plaid green and yellow interior. Some interior
pieces need to go back into place (water tank for sink, interior light
fixture) but it's complete. 

It's located in Houston, Texas. 

I've got to make room for a surprise accuisiton: a 1978 double-cab,
complete with the factory 2.0l type 4 motor. Couldn't pass this one up.
However, I jumped on this without consulting my S.O., hence the pressure
is on to sell the '78 Westy.

P-mail me if interested in the '78 Westy. The one picture I
have of it is online, along with a couple of pics of the double-cab.
