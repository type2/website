&lt;&lt; On the oldest junk busses I've looked at and
 taken parts off of, those regular fuel lines seem to hold up better over
 time. This is just my opinion. I went to the FLAPS and got standard fuel
 line and clamps for all connections. I feel much better with this setup.
 If your fuel lines are old, replace them. If you don't know how old they
 are, replace them. The parts are cheap and if the old lines fail it could
 be a real disaster.
 I am sorry to preach at all of you but I feel that I have now done my duty.

this is an excellent reminder......but here is a side note,  by using the
standard small hose clamps you run into the problem of overtightening them and
actually cutting the rubber fuel lines with the sharp edges of the clamp.
remedy.....go to your local flaps or specialty race shop and they carry any
size hose clamp that has a smooth bore on the inside.  none of the screw type
clamp edges to cause any cuts of anykind.  try them you like em.!!
