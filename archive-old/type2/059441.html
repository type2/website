Subject: Shifter Noise

I sent this directly to Todd at Volkswerks, but it bounced.  So I I
guess that I DO have to bomb the whole list with it...

Good morning Todd,

As the resident transaxle expert, I'll pose this question directly to
you rather than clogging the list.

History:

I have a '77 ASI Riviera w/ about 150k miles on it.  Lately (last 1k
miles or so) I've noticed an increasing amount of vibration/noise from
the shifter in third and fourth gears.  Noise is loudest around 70 in
fourth.  I have a polyurethane shift coupler so I expect that there is
less noise damping than the stock rubber bushings provide.  Transaxle
has always had a fair amount of whine in the lower gears.

Questions:

Remote diagnoses?  What year transaxles are direct interchanges?  Park
it, or drive it while assembling $s for comeing rebuild/replacement?

Thanks,
Jim Arnott
Union, OR
