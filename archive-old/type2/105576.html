Subject: Re: [T2] Power windows

&gt;The aftermarket power window kits (all that I've ever seen anyway) are
&gt;basically motors that attach to the same place that your window crank handle
&gt;attaches to.  They fit behind the door panel so you don't see them and
&gt;there's a plug that covers the hole where the handle used to go so it's all
&gt;invisible.  But it still uses your stock window regulator.  If yours is
&gt;broken you're going to have to replace it with another one.  Otherwise
&gt;you'll have a $150 electric window kit that doesn't do anything but make
&gt;some noise (and open/close your passenger window of course).

I don't know the suppliers from anybody so YMMV.
