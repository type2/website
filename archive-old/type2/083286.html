Billy, Dave,

Pardon the possible forgetfulness, it's been a couple years, but...

The &quot;protrusion&quot; on the bottom of the shifter is a pin about an inch long
that goes thru the ball.  It does locate the shifter and keeps it from
twisting.  thing is, if it slides back at all, you have a bear of a time
getting the ball into the cup.  The freudian implications are enormous :-)
The solution I have is to make sure the cup is stuffed with new grease and
that pin and ball are slathered as well.  That at least provides some help
in keeping the conical spring from kicking the pin back.  Remember that he
pin has to be all the way forward.  The problem comes if it is at all back
thru its hole.

On greasing the carriers, well, a long bottle brush slathered with grease?
Even more freudian, but it might work :-)
