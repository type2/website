&gt; Stay away from the treated wood. Tis only pine. I'd go for the hardwoods. 
&gt; Stronger and a bit heavier (concentrate on heavier). Look for a hardwood 
&gt; specialist. The local place is half-price when compared to Lowe's or Home Depot. 
&gt; When I was in the Navy teak was used where rot resistant wood was required. 
&gt; Maybe you can epoxy the new wood in place. I know in replacing wood in the old 
&gt; Fords (Model A, Model T) no one uses pine. Always oak or some other hardwood.

   Ash is the wood of choice for discriminating coachbuilders... ;-)
