Subject: Turn Signal/CV Joint

Hello everyone,

I have to quick questions:

1)    I was just wondering how much damage I did when I snapped off one
of the bolts while tighting down the drivers side CV joints.
Unfortunately, it was the last one I tighted.  It's also the side that
connects to the tran.  Will I have to take it off and tape the broken
bolt off and reinstall or will it be fine?

2)    This morning on my way to work my turn signals wouldn't work for a
right turn.  Then I noticed that when I turned my head lights off it
started to work fine.  Is there a short or some wires touching in the
dash.  Or could the wires be touching in the steering column?

One more question:

Just last week I noticed it was hard to shift into the gears.  It seems
that once it's run for a while, it gets harder to shift.  A couple years
ago I put in a new pressure plate and clutch plate.  Should I have
someone look at it first or adjust the clutch first.  I have never
adjusted the clutch, so any help would be much appreciated.  I am
willing to drop the engine, but thought I would ask if I need to.

I own a 72 Campmobile.  The engine is an 1800.

Thanks Dean
