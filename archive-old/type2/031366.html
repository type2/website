Thanks for the wonderful insight John.  You are correct that it'll take
some money to build this T4 right.  I'm going to go the budget route and
mic out parts, see if they are within spec or not.  I know T4 stuff ain't
cheap but I'm pretty darn confident that with the time element of a year
that I have to play with on this, I can do it for cheaper AND spread the
sting of new parts over a longer time frame. :-)  I've been told that my
Porsche 914 heads are worth having rebuilt and a place called
www.bostonengine_dot_com is a good place to start.

I'm in for a rough ride but I'd like to at least try.
