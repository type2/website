Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

#1. Go for inspection with a new oil change.
#2. Get fresh fuel if the van has been sitting or has any additives in
the tank.
#3. Run it hard at 50-60 MPH for fifteen or twenty minutes and get it
good and hot.
Those are the tricks I know.

&gt; After reading Bob's post about the fans not reaching the air intake 
&gt; I
&gt; have a question. I am going for  emission testing next week.
&gt; In Connecticut they put your car on rollers and take it up to about
&gt; 35mph(not sure that real speed just a guess) with a probe in the 
&gt; tail
&gt; pipe. They have a fan mounted on a gate like setup they just swing 
&gt; out
&gt; in front of your car. If they test my vehicle on this set up
&gt; the fan will be useless for my bus? Should I not worry about it or 
&gt; could
&gt; this overheat my bus? Any CT listees been though this?
&gt;
