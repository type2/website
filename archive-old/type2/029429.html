&gt; Just bought some MaxMiler 185/14c tires today.  Would have gone with the

This brings up a important point about tire-shopping for buses.  You have
to plan ahead or you'll end up in a pinch buying tires you really don't
want.  It pays to get another wheel and keep a second spare around.

&gt; I am departing
&gt; on a road trip from San Diego to Wyoming (Yellowstone).  This is my bus's
&gt; maiden voyage.  Any advice appreciated.  Any AIRS that want to speak up just
&gt; in case?  I can't wait.  It is the fist time I have had a vacation in 6
&gt; years!  Yee haa.

Good for you!  My best advice is to stay off of the interstates and enjoy
the thin lines.  They are better suited to bus speed anyway.  Let the bus
find its most comfortable speed and it'll be happy.

If you head up through Utah, you can head up US89 most of the way to
Yellowstone.  Before you get to the Grand Tetons (French for &quot;get a load
of those Tetons&quot;[1]) You'll go through the Star Valley, a rather pretty
area.

In Wyoming, leave yellowstone via the Beartooth highway and then drop down
to Thermopolis.  Swim in the hot springs (wear water shoes) and check out
the dinosaur center.  Continue south through the Wind River Canyon.

Fuel prices seem to be hovering around $1.65-$1.70 unless you are in a
particularly remote or touristy area.

Roads seemed to be a bit emptier this year, and accommodations easier to
find.  The Winnebago set seems to be taking this summer off.
