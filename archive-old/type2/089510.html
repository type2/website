Subject: Re: [T2] any Spokane, WA bussers?

&gt;
&gt; PS: I will be in Spokane for a few days the first two weeks of July. Are
&gt; there any VW or Porsche get-to-gethers happening during that time
frame????
&gt;
Dunno.  I was hoping to find that out myself.  Oh well, I will keep
searching.  Maybe I should start something up at my coffee shop.  If you
can, stop by my shop (ground zero espresso) it's in browns addition on
sunset hwy.
