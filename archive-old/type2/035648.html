&gt; OK - I used to think I was having a weird CLUTCH problem when the bus was
&gt; cold/just started, but a sudden flash of -DOH!- just hit...
&gt;
&gt; When I started the 70 for the first time (and esp. when it was cold), the
&gt; car would rock forward a bit, very perceptibly.You could hear and feel the
&gt; motor straining  a bit under this load. When very cold, this load would
&gt; stall the  motor. So for a while I was starting the car up with the clutch
&gt; pedal in, while I tried to think of things that could cause this; pedal
&gt; play too loose, too tight, bad return spring, t/o bearing, etcetc.
&gt;
&gt; TODAY, I had the DOH! I was sitting there WITH MY FOOT ON THE CLUTCH to
&gt; avoid this problem and I realized: when I start the car, I always have it
&gt; in NEUTRAL - the clutch has got nothing to do with it!  In neutral, the
&gt; engine is engaged to the tranny, but nothing should be happening; yet it
&gt; was.  Pushing in the clutch simply disengaged the pair, so that SOMETHING
&gt; in the tranny was NO LONGER spinning. And thus taking 'away' the sypmtom.
&gt;
&gt; SO. WHAT in the tranny is boogered that is spinning when it ain't s'posed
&gt; to, causing the axles to turn?

This is most likly your gear oil getting real thick when cold. When it gets
thick, it causes friction on the moving parts, making them want to move
together. Once the oil thins up (from heat), the problem goes away. My bus
has done this ever since I've had it. At first I thought it was maybe old
bad oil that for some reason was getting thick to easily at night. I gave it
an oil change and it still did it. A couple mechanics have told me that it
can be fairly normal with cars such as old VWs.
