My '72 is definitely the &quot;pancake&quot; engine. Looks just like 2nd link you
sent. Thanks Alex. I thank all of you who responded to my plea. It
definitely gives me something to go on. Wish me luck!

Hello,

I have a '72 owners manual and it shows the alternator warning light
as a G in the middle of a circle. One way to test for an electrical
short is to remove all the fuses from the fuse panel. Replace one,
run back to the battery and see if you get a spark. Repeat until you
find which fuse the short-circuit is on. Note, be sure that there are
no gas fumes while doing this.

I've put up some photos of the two types of engines

Early Upright style engine 1.6L (1600 cc), with carburetor, generator

Later style &quot;pancake&quot; engine 2.0L (2000 cc), alternator / Fuel
Injection. This engine was first introduced some where around 1972
on buses and originally equipped with dual carbs. Fuel injection was
later introduced on '75 and buses.

Hopefully this will help some.
