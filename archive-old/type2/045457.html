Subject: RE: [T2] VW jack or trolley + Brakes

&gt;I had a really hard time trying to adjust the drums on my rear wheels.
Does
&gt;anyone have any clever way's of doing this. Firstly the stars hardly move
&gt;and then I just can't figure out how they need adjusting. I can see very
&gt;little through those holes. Muir says you don't need to jack up the van
but
&gt;then how do you rotate the wheel to check the brake linings.

I got sick of fighting with the stars so i replaced them all, it was pretty
cheap and new ones make life much easier. I always jack my bus up as my bus
sense isn't developed to the point of adjusting the brakes without spinning
the wheel.

One thing I do to help me adjust the brakes is I carry a spare adjusting
star assembly in my toolbox. I bring that with me and hold it in about the
orientation I figure the &quot;hidden inside the brake drum&quot; star is and I can
see which way is loosen and which way is tight. I feel a little stupid that
I require a visual aid like this but I use my camper so little I only
adjust the rear brakes in the spring and can never remember the pattern.
