&lt;&lt; You're probably right about the insurance thing - but more accurately 

your insurance company doesn't want you to drive a Type 2 altogether - 

given the front passenger position and the extreme lack of crash 

protection.  Lets face it - getting into a bus in the first place you're 

putting yourself and your &quot;loved ones&quot; in a significantly risky 

environment compared to modern safety standards.

There's that, but also if there is a accident the insurance com-
pany is going to try not to pay any claims unless they hafta...
If you modify the vehicle in a substantial way such that the
vehicles original safety features are compromised (in the 
view of the insurance expert or a safety inspection) the
person who's injured may not be able to collect medical costs
from the insurance company...Nuthin' personal (as they say in
Texas)...Just bidness... ;-(
