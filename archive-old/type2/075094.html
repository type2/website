&gt; Try a product called Reflectix.  I'm living in Alberta, Canada &amp; it's
&gt; freezing here.  Not like the pussy Tenessee/Southern US freezing (you'd
all
&gt; perish here).  My whole bus is fitted with this product which is amazing
as
&gt; its totally flexible, never rots and can be cut &amp; made into any shape with
&gt; simple sissors.
&gt; Product is available at any Home Depot (yukkk)
&gt;
&gt; Caio &amp; good luck
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Greetings All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The Duck is going in to get a paint job next month and I am in the
process
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; removing most everything from the shell.  I pulled out the tarboards
from
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; engine compartment and I got to wondering..................surely there
&gt; must
&gt; &gt; be a better insulator than these *%^&amp;$#_at_ tarboards.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Recently when I was down in San Francisco I met a fellow Busser.  He had
&gt; &gt; removed the tarboard and placed some sort of foil faced solid insulation
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; its place.  The pieces were sealed on the edge and the whole effect was
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; of a professional job.  The metal tabs used to hold the tarboards were
&gt; bent a
&gt; &gt; little lower to hold this new insulation.  Pretty spiffy.  Clod that I
am,
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; didn't ask him about that at the time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Basically I'm looking for something rigid (I don't think I want to do
the
&gt; &gt; floppy NASA stuff like Matt Bulley did), non flammable, and resistant to
&gt; &gt; chemicals which will insulate both for heat and sound.  I know others
must
&gt; &gt; have conquered this little problem in the past.  Suggestions for
materials
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; resources?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; TIA,  Mike
&gt; &gt;
