Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck on the Drive!

Matthew,

Go back to the carb rebuild part and look for the accelerator pump 
diaphram and the &quot;injection nozzle&quot; that a quick squirt of gas should come 
out of.


Kind of a u shaped brass tube at the top inside ofthe carb.
3 to 1 odds says it is stopped up.  Look down into the carb(with safety of 
course) with engine not running...you should see a strong stream of gas 
come out of the nozzle on the end of this tube.

Beware!!!!  If you take it out of the carb body to test it, you need to 
consider carefully how to get it back in(it's a press fit).  I have 
revived many bugs where this part falls down into the engine and gets 
stuck in a valve.  You *don't* want this to happen.


The other possiblilty is the vacuum diaphram that advances the timing in 
the distributor.  You can test this one by sucking on the hose going to 
this diaphram and watching the plate inside the distributor move.

I am assuming all standard bug parts on this one....no 009 distributors.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Guys
&gt; 
&gt; It's been a while but you helped me great deal when rebuilding my type 2, so 
&gt; here goes, twenty two hours and one very frustrated man later......
&gt; Hi Guys
&gt; 
 I have a friends bug (1300 twin port) stuck on my drive, it idles fine and 
 under slow accelaration in picks up fine, problem is if you put it under 
 load (foot to floor), it mises for a second or so before picking up, in an 
 attempt to sort this I have
 
 replaced plug, condensor, points, ht leads, dizzi cap, set valves, replaced 
 carb diagphram, checked and topped up float, new hose to heat exchanger from 
 oil bath,  disconnected automatic choke in case problematic
&gt; 
&gt; Im all out of ideas, the only thing i can possibly think is that the fuel 
&gt; pump is weak and it;s emptying the float and not being replaced quik enough?
&gt; 
&gt; i know it's not exactly bus related but you guys so good last time i thought 
&gt; id ask
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again
