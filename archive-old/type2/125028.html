Subject: Re: [T2] What kind of ignition coil do I need?

Marc said:
I have an 81 Vanagon that was originally CA emissions.  Following the advice of the Bus Depot, I've replaced
the exhaust system with the 49 state exhaust and run a new oxygen sensor into the crossover pipe.

 I think the ignition coil is bad.  Do I have to stick with a CA one, or can I switch to a 49 state one (which
the store right down the street has and I can get today...)

If you still have the factory electronic ignition, you HAVE to use the correct electronic ignition coil.
NOT the 49 state coil!

The coil you need is the same as a early rabbit with electronic ignition: 211 905 115B

The 68-79 Bentley has a typo. They say 211 905 115C but this is wrong. It is correct in the 80-85 Bentley
Vanagon book.

The Bosch short number for this coil is 00041.
