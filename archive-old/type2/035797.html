There really is a drivablility improvement in the 71 suspension, as you probably
know, as well as the maintenance problems of the old design.

I was unaware that swapping the complete beam assembly from 71 to 68 was not
completely straightforward, but have been informed by listees that there may be a
bolt pattern or beam width issue.  The issue affected 68 and 69, not 70 models
which are compatible with the 71, I'm told.  Someone said there's archives about
this?  I didn't find authoritative info when I looked.

I question exactly what the difference is, it seems to me the beams looked the
same (I had a 68 for many years just before I got the 71) with the exception of
the booster mounting bracket, which is simple to add to the earlier beam if
necessary, clearance for mounting seems to be there (There is no difference in
the shape of the floor/chassis).   I remember I was able to stow my towbar in the
68 beam, tucking it in and holding it with bolt-up towchain, and in the 71 the
brake booster cannister interfered.   But I don't recall the beam dimensions
being different.  Others say they are.  I am aware that the chasis itself has a
framing difference in extra beams going out to the front corners at the door
hinge pillar, it stops some vibration in that pillar that was evident in my 68.
It also adds weight you can feel in the 71 vs. the 68, so some frame evolution is
there.

Your overall track width on the 71 is wider, and there are wider wheels
contributing or being the sole cause of this.  Measure the things to see if this
is the case.  Consideration of tie rod lengths for the correct track width may be
necessary.

I would also do what you are doing at the point any required maintenance to the
68 involves rear axle bearings or front ball joints, otherwise the conversion
work could be defferred until that time.  Just pull the components from the 71
now and start analyzing how to make them go into the 68 at the necessary time,
you have the luxury of doing any conversion work to these components at your
leisure.

If beam incompatibility is just bolt pattern only, maybe you can drill relocated
holes into the 71 beam.  If it is width, I assume the 71 is going to be wider and
you can put in appropriate spacers (shims are part of the factory beam mounting
already).   If the beam is actually narrower and won't fit the 68 frame, I'd be
surprised.  I would still pursue the swap with a combination of components.

I was told that the beam swap has been done most frequently into the early split
windshield buses in order to allow the full ball joint and disc brake setup in a
vehicle that will have enough resale value to make the work invested worth it.
But I think that eventually the 68 busses will become nearly as valuable as the
splits and the 71 models, I'm thinking of the new vw bus retro design doing what
the new beetle did to the value of vintage bugs.

The real issue is that you want disc brakes on the front, no?  You may already be
focussed on changing only the outboard spindles, maybe the trailing arms with it,
I don't know which is easiest.  I considered that the beam swap was easier than
the component swap, but this was between two 71 buses.

It is not necessary to put the power booster into the system if you want to drive
a light bus and are comfortable using the extra pedal effort, I guess, but the
real joy of the brakes is there with the power booster working.  You can do a
vaccuum tap onto the manifold using available plumbing fittings as I did it to my
single port when I installed it into a 71.  But hold onto that dual port 71
manifold with the fitting on it and all those pieces for the connection to the
front (that black thing is an anti-backpressure release valve to hold onto the
brake boost if your motor momentarily stalls).  Someday you will want to use it.

If you try the discs with just your old master cylinder and no boost, you may
find adequate braking power by using the right linings and keeping tire diameters
at below stock.  I know my bus currently has braking response that was noticeably
diminished with the use of larger than stock diameter tires on the front.  I am
using metalic linings for the first time and they seem to have more bite.  Then
if your master cylinder evenutally needs replacing, make sure you can adapt the
71 cylinder and a booster at that time, by putting the booster bracket onto the
beam anyway during your initial installation.

Yes, the disc brakes have power assist and a master cylinder for that purpose,
and it is worth it to get the whole system working, in my opinion.  The problem
is that you do have a much simpler and cheaper master cylinder arrangement in the
68 at this point, and I would judge what to swap based on the condition of
whether your 71 can contribute its master cylinder and brake booster parts in
good working condition.

I would not be too concerned with the fact that you have to run the vacuum hose
up there, it will not present much trouble unless you have the double floor
design on your chassis (european chassis only) that means you can't see the frame
members to route the hose through it.  I would not be put off by the need to do
some holes and pull the hose through if you can see what's involved.

I recently had to deal with a similar task in re-routing heater cables to bypass
plugged routing tubes and I found available holes for a straight-shot even though
I have the european chasis that has a bottom cover plate permanently mounted.  I
pushed a solid rod through and then attached cable with duct tape and pulled it
back through, finding some available holes for this very purpose, but these would
be too small for the original size vacuum line.  I question whether you need to
keep the size as large as factory if you run a metal line in the center of the
hoses, maybe the use of 3/8 copper pipe and a simple fudging of the hose
connections to this would be easy to route.

You should at least pull out the 71 master cylinder for potential future use,
those brake lines need to be handled with the best tools available, the brake
line wrenches are specialized to surround the nuts, they are tight and made of
very soft metal and it's not easy to work on them with the access.  By all means
hold onto the booster cannister because as a new replacement part, I hear it's
very expensive, that's wierd because isn't it used on lots of 71 to 79 buses?

You can simply trade the components on the outside of the beam ends on the front
end and not trade the beam.  But the beam has a mounting bracket for the disc
brake booster.  You will want to run a hose up thru the frame for the booster,
then there is a vent hose to allow for expansion venting that goes up into the
front area as well (no big deal).

Real advantages for the 71 running gear come also at the rear wheels, in regard
to rear seals, drums, and axles for the older buses being a source of problems at
every rear brake shoe change.

I traded beams between two 71's and it was a one man job with some creative use
of wood supports and a single hydraulic jack.  The brake system was not even
disrupted, though, the calipers stayed hooked to their lines and just unbolted
from the beam assembly.  Your project needs advice on what happens if you need to
hook the calipers up to the existing master cylinder.

I would stress that setting up your work area and the support of the car is a big
consideration for how much trouble the beam swap is,  I kept the car low to the
ground enough to support the beam in and out using a floor jack,  but noticed
that it was not as high as I would have liked it for working on the brake
cylinder stuff.

I was able to unbolt the brake booster from the beam and just leave it behind on
my swap to another 71.   I remember that upon reinstallation it was necessary to
be careful in locating the beam up to the other existing cannister as the beam
came in.  This is because I didn't have the master cylinder out or disconnected
in any way.  These components were awkward in their interference with the beam
going in, but if they are going to be disconnected I would look into doing that
job before removing the beam.  I think it was the master cylinder being in place
with the cannister attached to it that was the problem.   Use the book and
remember to locate the cables that pass through the beam out of the way as you
bring in the new beam.  But no special tools were needed for this job except a
tie rod disconnection tool, very cheap.
