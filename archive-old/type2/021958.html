Jim,

I would suspect that it definitely has to do with your charging system.. I
just had a very similar problem in my bus.. very very long story...  very
very stupid mistake..

This was my path in a bulleted version..

- I was having the same problem you were, the engine was basically running
off the battery.
- I figured that it was in the charging system, the engine would run as long
as I had a freshly charged battery.  when the engine was running the voltage
would drop. not increase indicating that it was charging. ( I could
disconnect the battery cable and the bus would die)
- I checked the obvious wires and regulator ground to no avail.
- Considering that the regulator is expensive and not just a quick, cost
effective, replace I decided to take the alternator off for a bench test at
the local Autozone.
- The FLAPS said that the alternator was dead - nothing - kaput.. 
- I bought a rebuilt bosch alternator
- installed it
- same thing, no charge, lots of head scratching etc..
- picked up a cheap (AutoZone -wagner brand) regulator no luck.  
- took the Alternator out again (I should come over to your place, I can do
this super fast now)
- had it tested at the same AutoZone - they said it was bad as well. 
- this is where I was getting suspicious, took it to 4 other FLAPS and none
of them could test it considering that they didn't have the correct specs
and plugs.
- found an old generator shop in town and they tested it said that it was
fine.. 
- started thinking about other possibilities and then it hit me, I replaced
my starter about a month ago. but had not been driving much so it did not
seem to immediately correlate.
- I went home and did what I should have done before - check every wire
connection, turns out that I forgot to add the alternator wire to the
starter.. (tons of wires there, this one was hidden next to the rubber boot
on the tranny.)
- hooked the wire up and wala - battery voltage shot up to 13.5 when the
engine was on.


A wise list member once said that Bosch finds about 1/3 of their returned
cores to be in perfect working order..  

As a moral to my story.
- Think of everything and what you have done to the vehicle recently.  
- Don't trust any of those yuks at the commercial FLAPS joints.

Possible In vehicle test procedure.. (Just an idea, others probably have
more experience)
I don't recommend this as an alternator test but you could pull the big
alternator cable off the starter and put a volt meter probe on it to see if
it's producing anything while the vehicle is running.  Just make sure that
it isn't still connected in situ with the battery and not grounded.  
- Also you might see what voltage is going to the DF wire to the alternator
from the regulator.  This wire is used to charge the armature of the
alternator building the magnetic field for generate power.. (any IEEE people
out there should pardon my poor alternator vocabulary and knowledge)
