&gt; Hi again. The past couple of days I have had a mysterious problem: My
&gt; generator light flickers when I am driving. The funny thing is that it does
&gt; not flicker when I am at idle, or when I rev the engine in neutral.
&gt; However, it starts to flicker in 2nd or 3rd gear, then persists until I am
&gt; again at idle. The flickering doesn't go away when I am coasting down a
&gt; hill in 4th gear, either. I have a '72 beetle engine with a generator. The
&gt; generator belt seems to be properly adjusted, so I'm not sure what's going
&gt; on. The lights and radio do not seem to have an effect on this phenomenon.
&gt; What could it be? Should I worry?
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of radios, I had a pair of big old JBL speakers sitting in my
&gt; garage collecting dust, while at the same time I had crappy little speakers
&gt; in my bus. &quot;Hey!&quot; I said to myself. &quot;Why don't I see if the JBL speakers
&gt; fit in the bus?&quot; I laid them on their backs on the top of the engine
&gt; compartment, with a piece of 2&quot;x4&quot; underneath the rearmost part of the
&gt; speakers to tilt them slightly toward the front. All I can say is WOW. No
&gt; more engine noise ;). Now I'm ready to compete with the low-rider pickup
&gt; trucks in the loudest stereo contest (he he he he). Actually, they sound
&gt; really good. The wood interior gives the bus good acoustics, I guess.
&gt; There's even enough room left for my tool box.
&gt;

&gt; P. S. To all those following my attempt to paint the bus with marine paint,
&gt; I have bought the paint. 1 gallon gloss white, 1 quart racing red from
&gt; Sears. About 50 bucks total. I hope to have it painted by Christmas. I'll
&gt; let everyone know how it turns out. 

Well yer problem lies in the brushes, their probably worn out and need to 
be replaced.. an easy and simple task, except fer the bottom screw, well 
i have a solution crazy glue the scew to the screw driver it stays there 
till ya snap the glue off(bend the screw driver) andyways my 2 cents..
as fer the speakers... i have a pair of really large Fisher house 
speakers in mine on the floor right behind the driver and passanger side 
seats. I have to say it sounds really good, ill have to try yer idea 
though, the funny thing is i drive a ratty old bus with a nice sound 
system when i pull up to stop lights people sorta look at me wierd like 
&quot;Bass from a bus&quot; (BTW no Rap for me thank you)
  Anywho...
