Subject: Re: [T2] hissing sounds / charcoal canister and HEAT!!!

From: &quot;Chris and Kell&quot;

&gt; Ok, on this topic, what are those tubes/pipes/whatever that go up into the
&gt; air intakes up on the side of the bus, and seem to connect just above the
&gt; motor in the firewall stuff? Mine are connected to nothing at all, and
&gt; appear to be missing whatever connects them to each other, or whatever else
&gt; they go to....
&gt;
&gt; I looked around and the only disconnected hose I found came off of the top
&gt; of the charcoal filter, perhaps this is where those two tubes should be
&gt; connected to?

Got a 68-79 Bentley? Section 5, page 3 has a picture and tells about them. The
pic only describes 70/71. Later models are the ''same thing, only different''.
Your 76 should have a cannister on the left half of the gas tank panel. The
thin hose from the right end of it goes up to the tee where the left and right
tubes meet back near the hatch. One thing to watch for is about where each 2
is in the pic: on your bus and later ones, there is a rubber connecting hose
that self-destructs and disappears. Then you fill your tank, and because the 2
lines come off the top of the tank, you end up with gas running out those
tubes.
