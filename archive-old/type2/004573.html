So, you spray water on the suspected vacuum leak and see if there is a
change in idle RPM in response?

Oil type - well, I hear what you're saying and....I'll think about it.

There are little tin pieces between the cylinders - are those the forget me
nots?

The tops of the RV pistons were clean and shiny - it was the sides of the
bypass RV piston that were scored.

Hi Russell,

See my other post on testing vacuum leaks in response to Andy.  Get a pint
squeeze bottle and a 2 ft hose.  Jet in the end of the hose to stream the
flow.  Got it?  More control that way.

(flame suit on) Ditch the 10w40 Castrol.  If using conventional oil up to 68
degrees, use SAE 30 and I recommend Valvoline.  Above 68-degree ambient air
temp, I use SAE 40.  Without FF filtering I cannot recommend synthetics in
T1 engines unless you are rich...but if you are, you drive a Lexus or
something.

Some builders leave out the under-cylinder tin that I call &quot;forget me nots&quot;
because if you put the heads on and forget that tin, you have to take it
apart again. Cool tin is either late T3 or aftermarket under-cylinder
tin...it works better but requires some modification to surrounding tin.
You can put that in when you do a valve job.

You could surface the tops of the RV pistons with successively finer grades
of wet or dry with solvent on a plate of glass if you're AR like me.

I tested the Berg device in boiling water.  The wire rotated to within about
1/8&quot; or a little more from contacting the screw, basically what they (Berg)
say it should do in their instructions.

Flaps are in place and open - T-stat and link rod are MIA (but on order).

I don't understand your procedure for vacuum leak testing with the fuel
hose, old main jet and water bottle - could your explain in more detail?  I
did look for vac leaks using the carb cleaner spray test method - and found
none.

Oil is Castrol 10W40 dino, new about 500 miles ago.

Fan and all shrouds are in place and correct and as far as I know are the
originals that came with the bus.

What do you mean by cool tin vs standard &quot;forget me nots&quot; under the
cylinders?

VDO gauges (OP, OT, CHT) are on order and should be in my hands by next
weekend.

I was not planning on modifying the relief valves, only replacing worn out
parts with new stock type parts if determined that they are in fact worn
out.

As always, your suggestions are most appreciated and helpful.
