Subject: Air Shocks

Now hold on...Before you guys roast me for not &quot;Doing it right&quot; and adjusting 
the freaking T-bars (and yea, been there, done that, got the mental scars 
from staring at a protractor way too long) I'd just like to know if anybody 
out there knows where a person could get a set of air shocks that will fit on 
a ' 79 loaf. This bus is my &quot;X&quot; bus, as in experemental. Not my daily 
driver(' 78 Westy, that I did the T-bars on) and just a test bed for 
things/ideas that are trying to escape from my head...God No, not the Voices 
again...So help me out guys. I know some of you folks must have thought of 
this before.
Parker, with flame suit on and ready.
