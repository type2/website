Subject: Leaking pushrod tube

Now I've been told that they all leak! But surely, those nice guys at VW =
would have designed a decent engine. It's only over here in the UK that =
we designed engines with bulil in oil leaks!

My problem is a leaking pushrod tube. I know that I should take off the =
wheel ,the rocker cover, the rockers  etc etc. and change the seal.

Would I be able to get away with a bit of gunk of some sort around the =
outside of the tube?

OR Do thay in fact ALL leak anyway?
