yes, the bentley is correct. There are some here and there (i'm one of
them) that get better results by anywhere from 1-3 turns instead of 2.
It is correct because a hydraulic lifter will auto adjust to what the
valve needs. If the engine sits a bit the lifters can (and do) bleed
down which causes them to make quite an awful lot of racket. It should
quiet down after a bit though.
