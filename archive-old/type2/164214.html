Subject: '69 horn

Well I have been trying to clean up the wiring on my truck. Thanks so much
to thesamba and bugformance for hooking me up with an original colored
Bentley wiring diagram.

 

Anyway my horn is not working, I determined from my meter that the horn
itself is dead. I hooked up another horn, that I know is good. I am getting
12 volts to the horn, but the ground at the horn does not appear to be
working. So somehow the wire between the spade connector next to the horn
and the spade connector under the horn button there is a disconnect/bad
connection. The guy at the shop thought there was another connection at the
base of the steering column which was probably bad. Yet when I check the
wiring diagram it looks like there is a connection in the turn signal
cluster. Before taking anything apart unnecessarily-anyone know where the
spade connection is that I can't see yet?

 

On a related note-how do you guys keep your turn signal cluster thing from
spinning on the steering column? The screws on mine are tightened as much as
they seem to go, and the cluster still spins a bit sometimes.

 

Thanks for any suggestions.

 

-Kevin
