Hello list,

My 82, 2.0 FI vanagon has been having some bucking/hesatating issues lately. 
  It was first noticeable only when cruising in 4th and it would give a 
little, slight hesatation every 20mi or so.  I went on a road trip this 
weekend and it got conciderably worse, most noticeable going up hills on the 
freeway and starting to be noticeable at all gears.  After reading the 
archives a bit I'm suspecting the fuel filter, which seems like a logical 
cause to me.

I was hoping for some reassurance as to weither the fuel filter would be the 
first thing to check, or if there is another likely culprit.

Any words of wisdom would be great.

Thank you

Casey Lohrman
