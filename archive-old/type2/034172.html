Subject: Auto trans and T1 engine

Automatic transmissions were (and still are) a luxury option in Europe. Not
many of them were sold in buses and then only in the more expensive models.
Autos are AFAIK never sold on 50 hp engines (in buses that is) as these
would be way underpowered.

I own a '78 with auto tranny (ex VW Wolfsburg works vehicle). Until I bought
it I had never even seen one. I was fairly impressed with it because it
drives like a charm.
