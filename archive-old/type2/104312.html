Subject: 78 bus FS in Vancouver Canada

Here is a decent looking 78 Champagne Edition.
http://www.bwaaa_dot_com/bus.htm
It is missing the correct chrome bumpers. The rear bumper is different.....
It is totally smog illegal here in California with the 34 Dells.....
Has the clock and middle seat. The material on the pass and middle seat is correct and in good shape. [Usually
the cloth on the Champagne Edition seats disintegrates.]
It is on that auction site starting at $1000. #2406343142
