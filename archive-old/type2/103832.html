I was thinking of the Stirling idea, but there's no way to run a
displacer piston with that setup.  Also, you wouldn't need filtered air
to the cylinders with a Stirling.

&gt; Strange though.  Wonder how much horses it is.

Well, if the energy to heat the cylinders comes from electricity, not many
horses at all.
