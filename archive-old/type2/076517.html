&gt; Hey VeeDubbers,
&gt; I got another rumor i want to have debunked. Thanks to Jim Hood for
&gt; dispelling the last one, in which a neighbor told me &quot;a car battery set on
&gt; concrete will lose its charge quickly.&quot; NOT TRUE says Jim.

Probably not true, but the battery acid will eat the concrete.  Do you
really want your battery's footprint in your garage floor?
