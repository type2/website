&gt;Choice 1: Ignore it. Deny there is a problem until it gets worse. If there

&gt;starts up when I need it and is reliable, won't break down. Does this rule 
&gt;out this choice for everyone?

Never ignore problems......unless you like being bitten in the ass, on some
dark rainy night in the middle of no where......

&gt;Choice 2: Replace the distributor with a 009. I read about unsatisfied 009 
&gt;owners who want a vacuum advance distributor. I guess the 009 is now the 
&gt;most common and easiest to buy. They come with points, rotor and cap. 
&gt;Cost: $50 each

The .009 doesn't work well on buses UNLESS you are running dual carbs with 
insufficient vacuum to
run a vac. advance distributor.

&gt;Choice3: Replace the points with a Pertronix igniter. They are virtually 
&gt;trouble free. They fully function even when the distributor gets wet. (I 
&gt;understand that Compufire igniter is not available for a single vacuum 
&gt;advance distributor and Pertronix makes a unit though) Cost: $70 to $85

Points work fine--even better with a CDI.  Save your money for one of 
those, instead.

&gt;Choice 4: Replace the vacuum advance distributor with a new 009 and 
&gt;replace the points with a Petronix igniter. This spends the most money, 
&gt;acquires the latest, easily obtainable, reliable technology. Cost: 
&gt;Distributor($50)+Igniter($80)=Total($130)

Lots of bucks spent, but it won't run well on a bus.

&gt;Is it pretty close of a decision for you?

Nope.  They all leave much to be desired.

&gt;What would you recommend?

An SVDA distributor from aircooled_dot_net.
