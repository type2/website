I've had a number of folks asking me more about the
diesel bus conversion that I saw in Madison in June. 
I haven't found the fellow's business card yet
(probably in the glove box in the 75 bus and the only
thing with a bigger mess is my desk).
I will keep looking for it.
One of the questions was about the radiator.  He used
a Mexican style type 2 radiator that fits the 68-79
style buses without too much work, I think. At least
their buses down their look like late 70's buses with
radiators, and that is their stock configuration.  So
I think he gets the parts and trim and retrofits them
to existing old buses.  I just hope that I took notes
on the kind of engine, etc.  Regretfully, I did not
take any pictures.
