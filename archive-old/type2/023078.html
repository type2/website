&gt;If I read the original post right it sounds like she had the tire rebalanced
&gt;after the wheel weights fell off.
&gt;Missy also said something about the weights are now on the inside of the rim.
&gt;Were the weights on the
&gt;outside before? If this is true I can't see the tire changing 
&gt;&quot;balance&quot;that much
&gt;the weights are now needed
&gt;on the inside! It sounds like that tire could be bad.

There are two ways (maybe more?) to balance a tire.  My wheel balancer has 
an option to either balance using only weights on the outside of the rim or 
use the outside and the inside.  The former is faster and the latter is 
more accurate although I haven't been able to detect the difference, when 
balanced to 0.0.  It could be that the latest balance was using the 
inside+outside method while the earlier balance was using outside-only.
