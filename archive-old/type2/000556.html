Hello volks,
    unbelievably, Isolde was finally given a ticket yesterday.  The hard
work over the last 6 months seems to have paid off, and she is now legal- at
least for another year.  I just hope I have the time to tart her up as she
is looking slightly rough at the moment.  Anyway, at least she is
functional.  I'd like to thank everyone on the list for all your help in
getting her on the road, I am eternally grateful.

    thanks
        Tristan and Isolde

p.s. my brake reservoir is running low, what is the standard dot that would
be used, I thougt the fluid looked blue, but now I am not so sure.  What
happens if I top up with 5.1?
