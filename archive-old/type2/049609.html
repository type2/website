&gt; ...State parks are usually quite reasonable, especially if you tell them all
&gt; you want is a tent site.

They aren't that pricey around here (South Carolina) around $18-22.  However
if you have a pop top be prepared for some fancy talking.  More and more parks
are considering the pop top buses as RV's and not allowing them to park in the
tent sites.

YMMV
