&gt; This is big news.
&gt; The best news is the price. I can offer the first 4 units to listmembers
for
&gt; $299.95 (first come, first serve).  After that, it will be $349.95. This
is
&gt; less than many junkyards have been charging for used beams.  I have
several
&gt; units available now for immediate shipment, but (while I have high hopes)
I
&gt; cannot yet be sure of uninterrupted supply in the future.
