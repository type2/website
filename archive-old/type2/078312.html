Subject: Re: [T2] westy vs. campmobile question

Some things to see if you have a Westfakia..a transporter converted to a
camper:

No jalousie windows
vinyl headliner
vinyl behind the driver's seats

 These things can be added removed though.

Some Riviera's etc, had the vinyl, but they were all pop tops as far as I
know.

&gt; --Dolan had a '76 hardtop Westy for some time
&gt;
&gt; --I, too, have a hardtop Westy. It's missing a lot of the camping gear,
but it has the rear ceiling cabinet, flip-up table, and the folding rear
bed.
&gt;
&gt; I guess I have a '76 hardtop westy as well, as I have all the gear
mentioned above, sans hardtop. I always thought it was ripped out of a westy
(poptop) and stuffed in my kombi.
