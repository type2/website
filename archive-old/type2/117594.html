Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Brake Job - remove drum

Guys,

It's just not going to happen unless your springs that try and pull the 
shoes back together are shot.

The springs try and pull the shoes back toward the center after you let 
off of the brakes.

Count on replacing the shoes(you probably already are) and spray the 
daylights inside where the adjustors are with a penetrating oil...let sit 
overnight and then try to get the stars moved tomorrow.

Good luck, dave

&gt; OK, Dean, I forgot about this idea.  I am cc:ing the list to get their 
&gt; thoughts and input.
&gt; 
&gt; Basic problem:  cannot remove rear brake drum on '72.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Basic assumption:  adjusting stars are frozen and cannot be backed off.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Basic solution:   get some movement on brake drum and build on that movement 
&gt; until drum slides off (humor off)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Questionable Eureka!!:  If you unscrew each rear brake bleeder screw, the 
&gt; wheel cylinder pistons would want to recede into the empty wheel cylinder 
&gt; (brake fluid would drain/shoot/squirt out of wheel cylinder = empty).  this 
&gt; would take the pressure off the brake shoes against the brake drum, and you 
&gt; should be able to whack the sides of the brake drums to encourage the brake 
&gt; shoes to 'back off'
