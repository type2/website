Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 Thermostat

John, Terry:
Maybe we might all ratchet it down a notch.


&gt; Go ahead and criticize the rest of us all you want for our mis-use of your
&gt; terminology, and different values on keeping our cars on the road.

(John)
You are exactly right about VALUES.
Does every $500 or $200 Type 2 need or deserve a $3000 engine?
I've had probably 15 type 2's over the last 20 years, that in total expenses
(except consumables) did not total what one of Jakes engines would cost.
(And that's not to say that Jake's engines are not worth every penny. Just not
my priority, that's all.)
And we have to forgive Terry Kay, as he is a member of the Vanagon_dot_com list
where they are quite a bit less civilised than us and regularly make personal
comments impugning each others mothers and excretory functions, quite apart
from adding to the general type 2 knowledge database from which we all draw or
contribute.

Adapting the type I thermostat is like putting hyraulic lifter's into a
solid lifer engine !!:&gt;)
(Terry)

Terry, that is a really good analogy. In other words, it's a little
unorthodox, but works fine and has some certain advantages! That works for me
for both.
