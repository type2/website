Subject: Re: [T2] What about diesel conversions?

Maybe gas at $25 a gallon might change your mind. Google &quot;peak oil&quot; - very 
soon the price of oil is going to go up and skyrocket and will never ever 
come down due to production decline.

Also I heard that the donut grease smells great coming out the exhuast. :)

&gt;personal vehicle? No way, not for me!
