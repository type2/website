Welcome aboard, Tom.

&gt; When I put up the pop-top the seal around the edge of the pop-up sags for
&gt; several feet in various places.  I can't see what's to keep this seal in
&gt; place, unless I'm supposed to use some sort of glue or sealer.  The seal
&gt; itself is flexible and supple.

It's held in place by a metal clip buried inside the rubber seal.
When the old metal clip gets relaxed or rusty, it loses it's grip.

&gt; 
&gt; What's the &quot;cure&quot; for this problem?

My cure was vinyl bathroom caulking in a tube.  Squirted a bead
into the groove of the seal, and pressed it back in place.  Then
masking taped it in position until the caulk set up.  No sags
for over a year now.

Good luck,
