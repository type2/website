Geico? dont walk... RUN!

  I had a &quot;kid&quot; slam into the back of my &quot;parked&quot;
Jetta a while ago and had to fight them for 3 weeks to
cover it. They kept advising me to turn it into my
carrier... Having a long term relationship with my
carrier I was able to talk with them &quot;off the books&quot;
and get advice on how to beat on Geico.
  It was not a happy experience and I would add that
this is just my experience with this carrier.
  I would add it was even a less pleasent experience
for the kid they were &quot;covering&quot;.
  On a positive note I almost drove my bus but at the
last minute took the Jetta.. who knows what they would
have tried to pull if it had been the bus that got
hit.
Your milage may vary....
