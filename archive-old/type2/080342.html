I still think it is the shop's responsibility to make it right.
The original engine locked up - any number of reasons for that, but if yo=

I work in tech support for a major computer manufacturer.  If we work on =

Unless you really got a deal on the job (under$500), i'd keep hassling th=

it locked up. You payed these guys for a running bus.
