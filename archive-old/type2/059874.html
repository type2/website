Subject: Weird Parts?

       Just finally got around to putting the tranny in that I got from
a fellow listee (Darrel Bohler -- thanx again Darrell) and of course a
new clutch plate, since I had driven 550 miles in 3rd gear with dozens
of 3rd gear starts, I figured the new clutch plate I had put in before
leaving Mobile, AL was probably toast.
      Well, it smells burnt, but comparing it with the new clutch I got
from Bus Depot I noticed that the old one was noticably thicker (despite
the abuse) than the new one. Got out the trusty micrometer, and sure
enough, the old plate measures .380 and the new one measures .365   ---
so of course, I'm in a bit of a quandry as to which one to use. The new
one, I guess, since the heat might have caused unseen inner
deterioration of some sort which would cause the plate to fail shortly,
but why is the new one so skinny?
     The old plate was genuine Sachs, came in a sealed Sachs box. The
new one also came in a Sachs box, but only taped closed, and while it
says Sachs on the hub, stamped on the lining it says &quot;Presidential&quot; plus
some other stuff and &quot;Made in USA&quot;.
      Guess my next clutch won't be from Bus Depot. It might be cheaper,
but clutch lining thickness is certainly one area I don't want to skimp
on, seeing how much hassle it is to change the thing.
