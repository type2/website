&gt; So my bus is a 1969 with stock 1600 and everything is the same except

&gt; small circular ?? (Yikes, I don't know what it is) near the base of the
&gt; fuel pump. After being stored for 5 years  I just recently towed her

&gt; mile radius), which is about 40 miles from my home.  I was going to have
&gt; my AAA tow it there, but now am wondering if I'm being a &quot;wus&quot; to tow
&gt; her and should drive her instead?  Aside from the occasional dying,
&gt; could this really foul something else up?  Thanks a bunch for any advice.

the fuel pump is one of the easiest things to fix,  there are good ones
from a few of the suppliers and a $20 or less alternative electric one
from your local parts store.

gas in the oil can cause loss of lubrication, and in a worse case scenario
even could cause a fire...probably wouldn't hurt if you changed the oil
and just drove the 40 miles. but a fuel problem, especially if the bus has
sat for as long as yours has, begs for fuel line replacement anyway

good luck
Bob
