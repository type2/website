Aloha everyone!

 It's been a while since I first posted here, and since then I've
successfully (for the most part, as you soon shall read) completed my
first engine overhaul. 

 A few months ago my compression was falling (all below 100) and the
intake valve on #4 was depressed into its seat. So I pulled the engine and
replaced the rings and the 3-4 head. Without too many little problems I
was able to get it all back together and in the bus. The compression in
all cylinders is now above 100 and the valves are all where they should
be.

 Also, with the previous engine (before overhaul) there were some vacuum
leaks around the manifold seals which I'd fixed with silicone putty and
metal tape. The engine idled and ran great. You wouldn't have thought
there was a problem other than the lack of power.

 I've since replaced the manifold seals, along with any other gasket I
came across, which also fixed an oil leak from the cooler.

 So these are my problems :

1. Timing is now waaay off from where it should be. Previously I would set
the timing to 5 adtc, just where the books say it should be, + or - for
the sweet spot. Now, the timing must be set much more farther advanced for
the engine to even start, let alone go down the road. I get closer and
closer to the optimal placement as I drive down the road and stop every so
often to advance it a little more. It feels pretty close, which leads to a
few other problems.

2. There is this bizzare sucking/whining sound coming from the left side
of the engine compartment. It appears to be pressure related. When the
engine is cold, it does not occur. Only after warmup will it start. If I'm
accelerating down the road, it does not happen. When I let off the gas and
coast in gear it starts whining. When I accelerate again it cuts off,
gradually, depending on how far and how quickly I push the gas pedal. If I
push in the clutch while coasting or if I'm idling the engine and not
going anywhere it will whine. Which leads to ...

3. Engine does not idle. It appears to be because of a vacuum
leak, which is probably the source of that whine.

 I'm pretty sure I can deal with the vacuum leak. I just need to get my
hands on an acetylene or propane torch and see where the engine sucks in
the gas.

 It's the timing that has me most confused. I don't understand why it
would have moved so far after the overhaul. Strangely enough, there were
white marks in the approximate location it must be timed to now, in
addition to the 5atdc marks, made by a previous owner. So apparently it
must have been timed there at one time. When I got it however, it needed
to be timed at 5.

 Help!

 Aloha!

 Ian
