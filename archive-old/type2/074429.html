Subject: Re: spare tire mount

Tom,

I haven't kept up with this subject so if I am repeating someone I am
sorry.  I recently removed the spare tire mount from my 74.  The
bottom two bolts I could reach from the inside.  I couldn't see them
but I could feel them and get a wrench on them.  The top two bolts
were &quot;J&quot; hooks that had threads and nuts on them.  After I removed the
all the nuts and removed the mount I wiggled the &quot;J&quot; hook bolts until
each came out.  I believe the &quot;J&quot; hook bolt is designed to spin and
catch on something or stop spinning as you tighten the bolt.  If the
whole bolt is spinning with the nut as you try and take it off then
cutting might be the only way.  I'm sure you've sprayed it already
with rust remover stuff?

&gt; Dear List,
&gt; Sorry to have to revisit this topic, but I spent a good hour
yesterday =
&gt; removing the kick panels, windshield washer reservoir and lots of
other =
&gt; PO add-ons to get to the front inside sheet metal of my bus, to try
to =
&gt; see where the spare tire mount bolted to the inside. Due to the
metal =
&gt; heater channels and other welded metal parts, I could not even
visualize =
&gt; the studs, nor stick my hand up there, to feel around.
&gt; Can anyone help with this? I want to remove the spare tire mount and
=
&gt; replace to stock with the original emblem. One list member suggested
=
&gt; that I cut off the studs from the front and push them through. That
is a =
&gt; possiblity, if they are not removable from the back.
&gt; Thanks in advance.
