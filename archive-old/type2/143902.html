Subject: Re: [T2] Ball joint boots only?

I wouldn't mind seeing pictures of that get-up.  I
figured replacing the boots wouldn't be so bad.  Maybe
not.  My boots are torn pretty badly, though.  I don't
know why that happens.  KR

&gt; Wish I had done this. Replacing just the boot was a
&gt; PITA. Wonder if you 
&gt; could clean the boot enough to brush a coating of
&gt; silicon over it and have 
&gt; it stick?
&gt; 
&gt; Phil
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I greased the boot tear with a needle tip, as well
&gt; as through the top
&gt; plug.
&gt; Then wrapped polyethylene over and around the arm,
&gt; followed by poly tape
&gt; criss-crossed to allow movement but keep out water
&gt; and keep grease in.
&gt;  Think that was over 50K mi ago.
