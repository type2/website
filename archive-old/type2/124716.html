Subject: AIRS Update &amp; A Pressing Tune-Up Matter

Hello,
I got a call awhile back from some travelers in a 1972 Adventure wagon with
a blown transmission. They were stranded in the Bay Area close by. We pulled
the motor out and (big) thanks to listmember Britt Grannis who provided a
good used 1700 transmission free of charge, we were able to replace the bad
transmission and get it all back together. We decided to replace a few items
as they're heading back to the east coast in a couple of days. Namely a tune
up. Replaced the coupler as it was toast and the accel cable was a
'two-piece' job held together by a barrel nut. Anyway the tune up parts are
wrong because it turns out they're running an 009 distributor on a 1978 2
ltr hydralic motor. The motor also has some very beefy looking Weber carbs
over each head with a linkage bar. We had no problem finding tdc and lining
the rotor up with the notch as it appears the distributor drive shaft was
intentionally sunk a few degrees off to accomodate 009 timing.

Static timing went fine but as you can imagine trying to time the 009 on a
pancake dynamically with a timing light was not fun at all. After a bit of
effort it's running like doggie doodoo and they're about to get pushed onto
the road by their landlords. Now I know that someone in colorado
successfully timed it dynamically, and I've poked a bit in the archives.
Granted we're working with used 009 parts (pts/cond) which could be causing
the anguish, but it did run find before teardown. (We did try putting a new
rotor in and it didn't run at all. Put back the old one and it ran better
(both rotors were 04 033) so I guess everyone wore in together.

 I've got two spare distributors, one is an AT Trans 1800 1974 bus
distributor (timing 5 deg ATDC), for which I have new parts for, with a
small biscuit one nipple advance; and I also have a 1974 914 AT -Fat Biscuit
dual nipple Distributor. Both are good distributors with working vacuum.
Problem is, where would the vacuum line(s) go on a Giant dual weber set up?
They do have the larger servo line ported off the front of the left
manifold, but I do not see small ports on the weber similar to stock setup
and I do not anticipate finding any....so my questions:

1) Can the 009 be tuned well enough to work on a carburated 1978 w/webers -
enough to get them 3k miles, or is it a futile effort?

2) Can one of my Stock vacuum carbs be installed and what would be the
method for it pulling advance from the dual webers?

Please send me some words of wisdom...
Thanks,
Chris Sheridan
