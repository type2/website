Giff, You're correct, I am doing a set of '77 2.0 cylinders...and $280 is a &quot;good&quot; price for these.

The most fascinating thing I've discovered in pursuit of this question is the diametric opposition with which people address this issue. I've had responses and personal conversations that say &quot;just hone the hell out of 'em&quot; ...though none that clearly answered my question as to 'how to hone.' (In fairness, I think that honing is one of those skills that probably translates from hand to hand; not from mouth to ear. That is, I think you probably want to watch someone do it and then maybe try doing it yourself...but you probably can't describe a process easily in e-mail and expect someone to be successful doing it.) In contrast, I've also heard from people who suggest that honing is pennywise and pound foolish. 

I truly *believe* the answer lies somewhere in between. Note that I use the word 'believe.' My guess is that you can get somewhere between 30,000 and 70,000 on a set of properly honed cylinders and re-ringed pistons. When they're near the end of the wear cycle, honing and re-ringing can't fix the geometry problems that have developed. This *guess* is based on responses, conversations, and antecdotal evidence. If you take it as gospel on my word, than Muir titled his book after you. ;)

I've fallen back on the availability of cheap 1600 p's &amp; c's in the past, but what the heck would I do if the end of our economy came at Y2K (see my fiction writings for details)? With a modest investment in tools and spare parts, I can keep my bus going for a long time--at least until the fuel runs out--but as far as in-the-bus parts goes, it's reasonable to carry a spare set of rings and the proper tools to re-ring; probably not a spare set of net p's &amp; c's.

BTW, I'm not paranoid!! But I can't figure out why you're all looking at me that way! Stop it! Now! I mean it!

:) Joe (:

&gt;Maybe, but I believe Joe's doing a '77 2.0 liter, for which a set of
&gt;P&amp;Cs is $280+.
