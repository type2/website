Subject: Need To Sell

I have to sell my Westy (boohoo) moneys getting tight. Thing is I am not sure 
what it is worth.  Here is the story...1970 creme colored pop-top, all 
original everything including factory curtains. Everything works,  rebuilt 
original motor (German case) at a reputable local machine shop 23,000 miles 
ago, has total of 108,000 miles. Only rebuilt because it was getting a little 
tired, compression is 124 in all four cylinders. no rust, has been repainted 
in its life, body is clean and shiny, interior is original and perfect. I 
keep it stored in the garage and usually only drive on weekends. It has been 
a California westy all its life (inland). This is a van you could buy and 
take a trip across country immediately and not worry. I change the oil and 
adjust valves every 1,500 miles. Located in Northern Cal. If anyone has any 
idea of worth (I know it's priceless. but) please give me your opinion.
Thanks Tom                I
