Jennifer,
--a good thing to have. ;-)
  &quot;The oil light quit working, I will see if it is
only the bulb tomorrow.&quot;&quot;
--Two things.. the light or the transducer. both
are pretty simple to replace. 
&quot;&quot;I hope it is that simple.&quot;&quot;
&quot;&quot;Aside from needing to drive wearing a down sleeping
bag with leg holes&quot;&quot;&quot;
  Why not check out the heater system?
If your heater boxes are swiss cheese ure hosed. :-(
BUT if not...
* Make sure the control flaps just forward from the
heater boxes are opening.
* Is the tube that runs to the front of your bus in
good shape?
* Not sure if a 68 has this... but if it has the
&quot;distribution&quot; box which is at the front end of the
above tube then make sure the flap in it is opening to
allow for changing between heat and defrost.
* For the trip hang a curtain behind the front seats
so that you are heating a smaller space.
* If all of the above are in good working order then
you can get a lot of heat from the system by
installing
a marine bilge blower fan in line with the tube under
the bus. On the buses with the booster fan in the
engine compartment you can use the switch/relay system
that runs that fan but your 68 , as I recall, doesnt
have the booster fan. 
  I would reccomend then picking up a 12 volt relay.
You can mount the relay in the engine compartment or
under the bus by the fan. I would install it in a 
houseing to protect it from the elements if it is
outside the engine compartment.
  Install a switch on the dash and hook into a 
switched voltage source from the fuse box. In other
words a connection on the fuse box that is hot only
when the key is on.
Use this switch to operate the relay. They dont draw
much current. Then you could run a wire direct from
the battery WITH A IN-LINE FUSE located close to the
battery so that if the line ever shorts tween the
battery and the fan you wont have a melt down...
ooorrr
if the fan were to suck something and get locked up
it should start to draw high current and blow the fuse
instead of frying the fan. Check the rated current
draw of the fan you buy and install a fuse that is the
next size up from the rated current. You can get in
line fuse holders at any FLAPS.. I kinda like the new
style for this application. (sometimes called a Knife
fuse)
  At any rate... there is no reason fer freezen.. you
can get a surprising amount of heat out of these old
buses with a little effort...
Oh yeah I also replaced the tube with black ABS pipe.
You have to shave the ends so it will fit the buses
plumbing and then do a wrap with thin metal held on
with hose clamps at the ends. Metal flashing for
roofing will work fine. Also I wrapped the fan with
rubber from an old inner tube to help keep the
vibration from the fan from transmitting through the
metal of the bus.. helped to quiet it down. The PACNW
isnt as cold as where you will be but after having
taken these steps with my bus I can warm it up very
well when the temps drop down.

good luck on your trip
Dan
