Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

Your on the money here Dave--

First let me elaoborate on paint and wheels.
Every wheel known to man is painted right up to the lug nut stud hole--

I just installed 4 new Basset wheel's on a client's Legend car--he has 3
of them---
( Cars Not Wheels )
Every one of them is painted right to the holes--like solid paint man---

And I have never seen a wheel fly off any bodies car at one of the
races--round de round at 100 mph plus--wall smacking, bumper tapping
whatever--the paint does not prohibit the wheel from being
tightened--unless of course  a 90 lbs. Charles Atlas reject is cranking
them down--

I use anti seize on my vehicles.
Never had one come loose.
I do however enjoy the luxury of being able to remove the lug nuts when
I want to without losing my family jewels--

This is my preference--and my thought's--( again ) on the paint &amp; wheel
thing--

I just want to know where anyone has ever seen a new from the factory
wheel unpainted  in this area.-

C-Ya
