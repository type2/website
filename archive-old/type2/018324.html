Something else to consider.  When you pull the rear piece of the cooling shroud off,
you also remove your oil dipstick guide.  There is a rubber piece that connects the
guide from the rear shroud to the front shroud.  I'd pick one up at your FLAPS and
replace it.  They'll know what you are talking about.  If not, order one from
http://busdepot_dot_com.  The rubber part tends to wear out and is a potential oil
leak.  If this is your first time taking the shroud off, I'd allow some extra time
to dink around while you are doing it.  Say 4-6 hours, depending on how easily you
are sidetracked.

I'll be posting a URL with some pix soon.  Stay tuned...
