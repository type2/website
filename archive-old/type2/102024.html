Subject: Re: [T2] Disc brake problems

I believe what is suggested here is not enough free play in the actuator rod 
that pushes the piston into the master cylinder, causing the pressure never 
to be fully released from the brake system.
It maybe that the pedal linkage is not correct for your new setup.
Are all the parts you have combined compatible in length?
If you disconnected the pedal linkage from the MC and the brakes release than 
you have a free play problem.
I don't know if there is an adjustment for rod length.
My Audi had the exact same symptoms after I replaced the master cylinder and 
it was a simple adjustment of the actuator rod that was needed.
Any one know if the rod is adjustable?
I have deleted the initial post so I don't know what year body you have.
Wolfgang has a spacer for 1967 disk brake conversion.
It goes between the MC and the mount which gives more rod freeplay.
I drove a 71 bus with the vac booster disconnected and never had any problems 
like you have described.
Hope this helps.
