&gt;Well, when I inherited my '78 Westy, I immediately went to the local VW 
&gt;dealer (Houston) to get some replacement parts and was nearly laughed out of 
&gt;there.  Not only did they not have any in stock, they were completely 
&gt;uninterested in even trying to help me get any parts.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe just my local dealership, maybe not.

Fer sur it is. I used several VW dealers for parts till I found Carter VW
in Seattle. With a three minute phone call I know if a part is in stock,
either at Carter or from a helpful nearby VW dealer, or in the Reno
warehouse, or from der Paterland, and the price. I have the parts next day
or 3 days if from Reno. That reminds me. I have to order a new exhaust
bracket for a Wasserboxer. 

Very rarely have I gotten a wrong part. Can't remember ever the parts being
a day late of schedule. Something strange happens? They call me NOW and say
what happened. If something is NLA, they say so and we all pity the loss
and piss and moan about it together.

Want the best danged VW T-II dealer parts man you can find? Find one who
owns a restored T-II.  I know an VW/Audi parts man that has a TOTAL
showroom T-I that works at Appleway in Spokane. Ask for Paul. You just
can't imagine the time and effort, with his high skills, that was involved
in finding every last genuine spezial piece for that car. It took him years
from within the VWoA system and without. 

Know also that the best danged VW parts department may have a not so good
rep in the service dept.

Just cause you run into a parts man that could give a s**t about your needs
or will laugh at you it doesn't necessarily mean the the exact opposite is
available elsewhere. 

&gt;
&gt;I order thru Bus Depot or go down to BAP Geon to get local parts for my 
&gt;Westy.  Both are always very helpful.

BAP has been around a loooong time and a Godsend for many Euro parts needs,
Fiats and Borgwards and such, though they are few and far between. I have
had the same spotty results with BAP as I have had with VW dealers. Same
thing with NAPA outlets. The experience all depends upon the character you
talk to. You will find a variation of good, bad and ugly attitudes. I'll
bet one in a hundred NAPA parts persons is an early VW nut and knows the
few things NAPA stocks that might be acceptable for VW use. Like, proper
spec lube for your tranny. Might be spezial order, but they can get it in
the Valvoline lable for you, if they want to. 

What would NAPA do if someone started selling mud flaps with NAPA logo
without license???

What if someone made up sets of VW repro wheel spindles with 'VW' cast in?
What if it breaks and someone is killed? Could VWoA get sued?? My
impression is VWoA is just trying to determine if some things that have
been going on can damage them legally or their reputation. The legal staff
is paranoid. Don't be painting the whole organization gangreen just cause
one digit gets frostbit.

The marketing dept. can think up some paranoia for themselves as well. Joe
and Bud are sittin' around. Joe says to Bud, &quot;Here, I got this VW hat the
other day. Have it.&quot; Bud says, &quot;Thanks!&quot;, then looks it over, sees a cheapo
$3.99 auto jumble flea market item and thinks to himself, &quot;What a piece of
crap. I'll NEVER buy a VW!&quot;
