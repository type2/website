Subject: Take my old 2.0L longblock (NC)

My old 2.0L engine was running fine when I replaced it last Spring. (OK, 
metal grit had been showing up in the oil and it had logged 260K miles, 
but it *ran* fine :)

I figured that Mark Stephens wouldn't give me much core money for the 
longblock, so I kept it. Since I'll probably not do anything with it 
before it starts rusting away, I'll consider passing it on to someone who 
wants to give it new life.

I'm asking for $100 (just to make sure you'll use it...)
