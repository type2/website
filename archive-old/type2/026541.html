&gt;I was poking around in the engine compartment of our 
&gt;other 1972 Bus today (the camper).  I noticed the oil 
&gt;filler and oil dipstick are mounted on top of the engine.  
&gt;On our blue 1972 bus, the oil filler and dipstick are
&gt;at the back of the engine.

The engine could be from a Porsche 914 or a VW Type 3 or Type 4.  The only
way to know is to find the serial number on the case and check the first 2
letters.  I don't know the other VW lines, but if it is a Porsche engine,
here are the applicable codes:  W, EA, EB = 1.7;   EC, AN = 1.8;   GA, GB,
GC = 2.0.  If it is a complete 914 2.0, there will be 3 bolts for the intake
manifolds instead of the usual 4 (and it is worth a lot more money to a 914
person).  Let us know what you find....

On the dipstick problem:  you can shorten the dipstick tube by sawing off
approximately 3 inches off the top and cutting off the bottom of the
dipstick by the same amount.  If the engine is in the bus, you MIGHT be able
to do this without getting metal shavings from the tube in the engine by
draining the oil and removing the sump plate (not the screen plate, the
other one that sometimes houses the oil temp sender) since it is a straight
free-fall for the shavings.  This is the solution I am using on the 914 2.0
I'm about to put in my 73 Westy.
