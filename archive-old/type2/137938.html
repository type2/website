Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

And not so talkative as others! I stay away from Samba (unless I'm
really bored!) and RMVA precisely because they have too much volume.
This list is quite good, and if I'm busy, I can skip over the messages
I don't have time to read. It's much easier to browse through them
when they come to you in email.
