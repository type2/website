Hi Melissa,

Well the only other reply you've had on list incorrectly assumes you are on
about an FI engine when you clearly say its a single carb both in your post
and in the sig line.

What you have described as two gaskets with some 'muck' in-between may
equally well be a description of the correct gasket.

The gaskets between manifold and head (both input and output manifolds) are
of a sandwich construction - two thin metal layers with a black compound in
the middle. The metal layers have a small ridge inset from the edge. The
sandwich is perhaps 2mm thick overall.

On fitting the metal ridge is deformed and the black compound is compressed
to take up any unevenness in the fit.

Because of the deformation these should be only be used once. (Although if
in good condition they often are successfully reused)

If the gaskets you have, have separated then you certainly need to buy some
new ones. Not sure if you will be able to get those for the input manifold
separately or if you will have to spring for a full engine gasket set.

There should be no need for any sealing compound except for the sandwich
construction compression gaskets.

Good luck

Subject: [T2] intake manifold question


i'll be putting my engine back in tomorrow.  when i removed the intake
manifold and carb., there were 2 metal gaskets on each intake.  these were
mucked with a black rubber like gasket material between them, on the intake
and on the engine.

do i need this muck?  what kind of liquid to rubber gasket is it...so i can
buy some.

on a side note, my butt hurts from the reaming at the machine shop.  $242
for 4 new studs, pulling out 2 stripped studs, and a helicoil in
#4.  ouch.  oh well, at least he didn't open up the engine to do it.  funny
though, he said the spark plugs were the wrong type, so he put new ones in
for me (without asking i might add.)  apparently, they weren't long
enough.  i'm interested to see how it runs now.  i better hear some
purrrrrrring!
