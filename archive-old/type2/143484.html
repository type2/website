(The following is a paid connubial announcement)

&lt;&lt; My wife, Magoo Jess, for over 25years, Never missed a Pomona Swap meet.
Magoo has been by my side at every car show swap meet, I have ever done. One
year when I was sick she drove out  to The Classic and did the show by
herself. Melissa has also worked on our two Splitty buses   and runs our VW
Toy business as well, again by herslf.

I was most fortunate to have her as my bride.  She is by far the BEST Lady I
have ever dated.  All I can hope is that you single males out there will be
just half as lucky as I have been in marriage. If so you will be very happy.
