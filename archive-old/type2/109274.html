Subject: RE: [T2] Sliding Windows

&gt; Does anyone know if the sliding windows from a 78/79 
&gt; Bus or even a vanangon  fit nicely into a 74 Bus?

&gt; Can't say for sure, but I do know they fit '76 and '77 
&gt; models, so I would guess it's a yes. The friendly people at 
&gt; Bus Depot may be able to help?


But of course. :-)

The windows are interchangeable '68-79. But a Vanagon window is too big
to fit a Bus.

We have brand new original-equipment '68-79 sliding windows (for the
sliding door or opposite it):
