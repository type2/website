&gt;I've done a lot of these, and I've yet to strip one, but I tend to be very
&gt;picky about cleaning the recess.

Ditto.  I've found that the recession is very deep and it is easy to be 
fooled into thinking the wrench is seated when in reality there is a bunch 
of crud in there and the wrench isn't going in all the way.  I usually 
start by taking a small flat-blade screwdriver and scraping out the cavity, 
then spraying carb or brake cleaner in there to get the small stuff and 
grease/oil out.  Then, with a good sharp allen wrench (even in the original 
12-point bolts) they come out.  If the allen wrench bends too much I use a 
&quot;helper&quot; vise-grip on the outside of the bolt head and turn it and the 
allen wrench simultaneously.  Using this method, I have yet to be defeated 
by even the oldest, crustiest CV joint bolt.
