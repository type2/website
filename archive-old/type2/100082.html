Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix report

This is reassuring although I have no idea what those folks at Ken's Buggy
Barn are talking about now.

After the good results from driving it around I was suspecting that the
ideal range of 49-51 was matched to the physical properties of the points
and that another value for the pertronix may not matter.

So the dwell varies based on tiny differences in manufacturing that unit?
Mine is around 53/54.

BTW, I found this very good article on how the kettering system works:

&gt; I called them at one time on the fact that the dwell seemed to be set
&gt; high and I couldn't get it to change by moving it around.  They said that
&gt; it would not make any difference and should be right where it was.
&gt; 
&gt; If it drives good and the timing is right on,....leave it!

&gt; I (unlike Dolan, who apparently loves to set dwell) put the pertronix
&gt; in my bus a few months ago. Love the results. My dwell was also high,
&gt; but I thought about it. So, the only reason you don't want a higher
&gt; than necessary dwell is so your points don't burn up, right? Well, w/
&gt; the elec ignition there are no points. Hopefully all we end up doing
&gt; is give the coil a slightly longer time to build up a larger magnetic
&gt; field to collapse &amp; give us a better spark at the plug. Haven't
&gt; worried about it since.
