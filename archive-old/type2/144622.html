Subject: Re: [T2] Busted Bus Website Down?

Hi Glenn, and all,
Yes, our site is down temporarily.  VERY frustrating.  Apparently, the host is having some issues. Joe is waiting for a call back from them as we speak.  They are not too nice and I am in the process of switching.  Everything should be back up real soon.  I'm &quot;stuck&quot; in Maui right now so my hands are kinda tied!  :-)  Sorry to all.  In the meantime, the phone is always up, leave a message if Joe doesn't answer.  877-TYPE-211
OR, shoot me an email at bustedbus_at_gmail_dot_com    When the site is back up, the permanent email for parts inquiries will be parts_at_bustedbus_dot_com
 
I'll keep everyone posted, in the meantime, anyone else trying to contact us, thanks for your patience during our &quot;move!&quot;
