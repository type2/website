Subject: VW Trademarks

Folks -

I can't figger this out...

Let's say I buy a used VW at a swap meet for $1000. I put a (non-VW) clock 
in it. I sell it for $1200.

Let's say I buy a used VW hubcap at a swap meet for $5. I put a (non-VW) 
clock on it. I sell it for $20.

What's the difference (beside $185)?
