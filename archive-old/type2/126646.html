&gt; The two easiest ways to improve mileage are:
&gt; 
&gt; - slow down. Huge impact on mileage if you're not in a hurry.
&gt; - remove unnecessary weight. Most people (including me) carry round a heap
&gt; of junk that they could do without. Also if you've got a campervan and your
&gt; not worried about keeping it stock there are considerable weight savings to
&gt; be had by reconstructing the interior in lighter materials (on my &quot;gunna&quot;
&gt; list). If your really keen it should be possible to make at least some of
&gt; the fittings removable so you only put them in when required (also on
&gt; &quot;gunna&quot; list).

I'm with you there. I have the dubiously wonderful opportunity to
rebuild the cabinets in my bus. Rather than use heavy plywood, I'll be
framing the cabinets and using 1/8&quot; panelling to skin it. Should weigh
half of what it did. If not less...

Plus, I'll be making the part that rides over the engine compartment
removable. The initial reason was so that I could carry full sheets of
plywood (or whatever) that wouldn't fit otherwise. But that gives me
an extra weight benefit.

Also, get rid of TIlly The Two Ton Toolbox. I had 2 big metal
toolboxes in my bus for a long time. Then I sat down and sorted out
the tools that I need to do any job on the bus. They all now fit in
one of those little plastic 99c toolboxes! Of course a timing light
and tach/dwell meter won't fit, but they ride just fine under the bed.
I'll be making velcro mounts for them soon though...
