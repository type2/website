Subject: First ever engine pull this weekend...

Hi all,

Just looking for some moral support for my first engine pull this weekend.
My '76 Westy has 214,000 miles on a never touched engine as far as I can
tell from the PO's history file (which appears complete).  It is coming out
this weekend to start a full rebuild as I intend to travel to Nova Scotia
this summer with it.  I've never worked on a car before, and just recently
gotten my hands dirty working on aircooled motorcycles, but I'm not afraid
to try anything, so here goes.  From the sounds of recent posts on this list
I should pull both engine and tranny if I want things to go smoothly.  Any
last words of advice before I embark on this life changing event?

Thank god for the list :-)

Obligatory Friday content:  Has anyone ever considered hooking up a laptop
and fully instrumenting their engine just for grins?  I can imagine things
like rpm sensors for the synchros in the tranny, individual cylinder head
temps, flow sensors, gas sensors and the like.  Am I insane?  How about
stress sensors on various portions of the suspension and frame just to scare
the beejesus out of you under hard cornering?

Looking for a 'vert Ghia to round out the stable.
