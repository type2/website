Subject: White Scum in Oil?

I am not sure if my mail is making it through.  I sent this yesterday but it
didn't seem to make the digest or the archive, oh well here i go again.
Sorry if this is a repeat.

Help!  When I went to check my oil today, I noticed that it was a bit low.
This is normal...my 78 bus leaks oil (I think from the oil cooler gaskets).
SO I went to add some oil. I noticed that on the inside of the oil filler
neck cap there was some white scum that looked like curdled milk.  It also
ran down the neck a bit.  Does anyone know what this is?  I am using 10W30
Pennzoil in a moderate climate (Vancouver BC)  I have never  seen this before.

Thanks

 PS. If you could reply directly as well because I am digesting thanks.
