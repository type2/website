&gt;    I picked up a used 34-Pict3 carb that looked to be in
&gt; better condition than the one I'm currently running.  I
&gt; dismantled it, cleaned it up, and put a rebuild kit on it.
&gt; 
&gt;    I could not get over how fast the engine started up.
&gt; Even with the temps pushing down past freezing.  The only
&gt; problem is that the engine eventually dies, and there 
&gt; seems to be nothing I can do to keep it running -- except
&gt; for keeping the RPMs up -- after the choke has opened, and
&gt; the throttle screw has stepped down the side of the cam.
&gt; 

Fill me in on the answers or possible answers to this one as well.  I
can't figure out if my lack of idle (fine until the engine warms up, and
then I can't keep and idle unless I raise the rpms) and think it might be
a vacuum leak somewhere.

Dwell is right at 48, timing is right on, all new points, cap, rotor,
condensor, choke seems to be functioning well, no apparent vacuum leaks in
the engine compartment....

Any other possibilities?
