&gt; Never add anything with TEFLON to your engine oil, it builds up under

You mean if I hadn't used TUFOIL for the last 15 years, I might go even
further than the 223,000 mi the same engine has gone so far??  Most type
4 engines seem to need a rebuild after 140,000 mi.
TUFOIL is a PTFE-molybdemum additive made here in NJ., particles are too
small to build up.  My compression averages 140 still.
