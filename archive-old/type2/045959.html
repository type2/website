Subject: [T2] Re: Hard shifting

Andy and Rob,
One misunderstanding can arrise if you follow the Bentley to adjust the 
floor plate on your gear shift mechanism. The drawing, Fig 3-18, is a view 
from the front of the van looking toward the rear, while the photo of the 
vertical adjustment is the reverse of the that view! So, remember to push 
the plate with a tip of the screwdriver toward the passenger side of the 
van, not toward the driver. I hope this may be your problem.
Roland
