Subject: Re: Exhaust air leaks...?

Odds are that the full coating of JB Weld would crack and peel off due 
the different thremal expansion ratios of the metal exhaust pipe 
versus the JB Weld.  Try it in a small area and see.  Be sure that it 
goes completely around the pipe and for at least 4 inches lengthwise 
to eliminate *edge effects* and relate back on test results!

It will also change the conductivity of the pipe. The additional mass of 
the JB Weld will increase the ability of the pipe to retain and transfer 
heat through conduction to other parts of the system.

I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

&gt; BUT. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF.
&gt; 
&gt; A person got a new muffler (like, cheap, a muffler made in a Third World
&gt; country like Brazil or Denmark) (or maybe German for that matter) and
&gt; covered the entire thing with JB Weld with a roller. Could you roll it like
&gt; paint? Could you thin it with lacquer thinner or something? Would this
&gt; maybe work?
