Hi volks,

Mike writes:

&gt; The PO of my bus bought Firestone F-560  185/70R14 tires in February 99.
&gt; Oddly enough he bought 5, the spare being mounted on a bent rim.  I FIND
&gt; these tires to be inadequate.

 I wonder what the load rating is? These sound like car tyres.

&gt; .. they look puny on an otherwise pretty big car, and they seem
&gt; to have too much flex.   The 72 Bus I owned years ago had the next higher
&gt; sidewall size and it rode a lot nicer than this 76.  I think they were
&gt; Pirelli's. ...
&gt; My humble advice is get something a little bigger than 185s.  Just my
.02c.

 Hmm. I'd say to get something bigger than the /70s: The &quot;185&quot; relates to 
the width of the tyre whereas the &quot;/70&quot; is the sidewall height (expressed
as a percentage of the width). The correct size is 185R14 NOT 185/70R14
since the absence of the &quot;section size&quot; indicates an /82 or /80 profile
tyre. I gather that this size can be hard to find in the US (although
far from impossible), particularly at a good price, so it's not unusual
to substitute a cheaper &quot;equivalent&quot;. This works fine as long as the
substitute has the same diameter (sidewall height) and weight ratings
as the original.

 There's lots of info in the archives/library on good choices for 
substitute sizes: It's worth learning what all the numbers mean because
you CANNOT rely on the tyre-jockeys to sell you the right thing. There 
are numerous reports on this list of tyre retailers selling bus owners
wholly inappropriate rubber for a bus (like 185/70 car tyres, for 
example). 

 Look for the Load Index on the tyre. This is an international standard
which (unlike metrication and octane ratings!) the USA actually uses.
It consists of a number (weight rating) and a letter (speed rating).
 Mostly people worry about the speed rating, since it's not unusual
for people to want to fit cheaper tyres (than OE) to their fast car, but
for us bus owners its the weight rating that matters.

 VW specify &quot;95&quot; as a minimum (indirectly- the scale didn't exist when 
baywindow buses were specced) and 97 as a sensible choice. IMHO it's
worth going higher than this: a &quot;load range C&quot; tyre would normally be
about &quot;99&quot; and I'm running load range D: &quot;102&quot;, in common with many
on the list. This is arguably OTT, but hey, that's my call.

 Here are the numbers:

	Index	lbs	Kg	Typical characteristics

	95	1521	690	Minimum safe weight for T2 Type2
	97	1609	730	&quot;Reinforced&quot; sidewall
	99	1709	775	Load range C commercial vehicle tyre
	102	1874	850	Load range D Commercial vehicle tyre

 Michelin (I think they were OE on baywindows) now have a range of
commercial vehicle tyres they call &quot;Agilis&quot;, See:
http://www.michelin_dot_com/us/eng/news/agilis/1.htm

 You'll see that they make an Agilis 61 in a &quot;99S&quot; rating and an Agilis 81
in a &quot;102R&quot;: Top spec. tyres! The 41 would be a &quot;97S&quot;, reinforced type
but they don't make it in a 185R14 because contemporary vans (like the
Eurovan) are tending to run 195/70s on a 15&quot; rim instead.
 
 Hope this is useful: Having the right tyres makes a very big difference
to the handling and safety of your bus!!!

Cheers,
	 W.
