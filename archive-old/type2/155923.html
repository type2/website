&gt; Botulinum toxin is colorless, odorless and tasteless, just like the
&gt; major beer brands. Next
&gt; question?

(Bus Content: The Guac's been running outstanding since replacing the
distributor! I've found where the spark was arcing... It was the
looped ground strap as someone pointed out. As the rotor and cap wore
and the gap between them increased, the tendency for the spark to jump
to the ground strap that was looped way up instead of going through
the resistance of the plug and wire increased. I still don't know why
it would seem to be fixed when I replaced the fuel filter...

Now I want a new Pertronix or whatever.)
