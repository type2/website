Subject: Re: Fair price to rent a bus

&gt; It's kinda like &quot;renting&quot;, or *selling* a family
&gt; member. Hmmmmm...Not Gonna Happen!

nothing wrong with selling a family member, as long as you keep your
bus, im the only one who can drive mine because i know all the little
spots in the shifter, like you gotta jerk it to the left a little to get
it into first, and second a little off to the right. insted of right
below first 3rd and forth have no tricks to them though
