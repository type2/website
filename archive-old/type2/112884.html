Subject: Re: [T2] darn shifting ...

Is this while you're moving?  It is normal that it's difficult to
downshift.  The reason is because the syncros have to spin up.  This
will happen on any stick-shift, especially trying to get into 1st while
moving.

Or, is this when you've come to a stop?  If so, that's probably a
different problem that I wouldn't know the answer to..


&gt; Trouble shifting from third to second to first.  Once I'm in first goes to
&gt; second easily, but in becoming increasingly difficult.  Third to first
&gt; almost always impossible, must go from reverse to first for a sure start.
