&amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;lt;BTW a four-cylinder engine is capable of producing better MPG than a six

&amp;gt; &amp;gt; From the acetone link...

&amp;gt; &amp;gt; I think I don't understand. I thought because a smaller 4 cylinder engine
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; runs at higher RPMs to make power that it would have LESS time for
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; combustion... My VW Cabrio runs at 3500 rpm, a big V-8 in the family runs at about 2200
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; rpm for the same vehicle speed.

I think that the phrase left out is &amp;quot;of equal displacement&amp;quot;.  Such an
engine would have slower rpm allowing more time for combustion.  However,
by the same logic the best engine would be a single-cylinder engine with a
trash-can sized piston.

I smell an overgeneralization, which isn't unexpected on that site.
