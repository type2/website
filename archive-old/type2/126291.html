&lt;&lt; There's a turbo kit on eBay that includes FI rig:

category=33742

Any possible way to get this working on a Type4 1700? Intake and
exhaust manifolds would be different, right?

Just one word about turbos...Heat...The better systems use an
intercooler to bring the temperature of the intake charge down.
Now, I don't doubt that there are turbo'd VW engines out there,
but for an everyday driver as opposed to a drag racer... ?-(
