&gt; &gt;About mounting a wench.
&gt; &gt;Wenches are a popular item to get stolen. I've lost many of them over the
&gt; &gt;last thirty years.
&gt; 
&gt; Well now every wench I've mounted in a Vw has stayed mounted, good and
&gt; proper.
&gt; Loose wenchs are to be prefered in fact.
&gt; Anyone stealing my wench would be dealt with summarily.


heck I can't get my wench to stay on the front bumper, she insists on
sitting inside on the front seat.

sorry couldn't resist

I have kept a length of chain and a come along in the bus so far there is
no place it hasn't gotten me out of... the length of chain streechs the
cable on the come along which never seems to reach the ---- that I need to
grab
