Subject: [T2] Bus Heat


&gt; Hi Everybody!
&gt; One of the previous owners of my '78 Westy gutted the heating system, all
&gt; that remains are the naked fins of the heat exchangers. I am wondering how
&gt; well the stock system worked in the first place, is it worth replacing all
&gt; those pricey bits?
&gt; Memories of my '62 Type 1 and '76 Super Beetle &quot;heaters&quot; during Minnesota
&gt; winters have left me suspicious about how effective heat in a bus could
be.
&gt; My Westy is garaged all winter, so when it gets brisk during the spring
and
&gt; fall months we just dress warm and use an electric ceramic heater (110v)
and
&gt; the dogs to take the edge off at night when we're camping.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Doug Swenson
