Subject: Bus Tour Calling Kevin Ahlgrim:-)

Dear Folks

We are trying to get in touch with Kevin Ahlgrim. Shelby Bell is going to
the music festival in New York and will meet up there with Jeff McKenna for
the hand-off. After that, Shelby has graciously offered to drive the Hubcap
to LaPorte to Kevin for that hand-off so the Tour can start it's Midwest leg
in earnest.

But, we've not been able to contact Kevin! If you know how to get in touch
with him, please p-mail me and let me know. Thanks for your continued
interest and support!

Chris
