Subject: Kudos to Wolfsden Imports
Mime-Version: 1.0

I received today the German muffler kit that I ordered from Jonn at
Wolfsden Imports (888-428-1797).  Not only was I impressed at the $99 price
(complete with installation kit, tail pipes, etc.) that he gives to
listees, but his customer service level was top notch.  This price was much
less than I had found anywhere and quite frankly, after much frusteration
from ordering from other suppliers I would gladly have paid him more simply
because of his service level.

I recieved the German kit for my 1970 Type II and all was packed very well.
 I have already placed another order with Jonn for some other parts that I
needed.

Even though I am in Atlanta and he is in Seattle (I think) it was worth the
extra time in shipping.

I will definitely be doing business with Jonn in the future and would
highly reccomend him to anyone looking for VW parts.  He is truly top notch.
