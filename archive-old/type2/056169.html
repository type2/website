Subject: gas heater
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

so I have this gas heater from the 73 parts bus (engine
compartment type)
and I have a heater switch on my 77 body (under bus gas heater
set up)
I was wondering if I made the gas heater fit in the engine
compartment of the 77, would it be ok?
would the switch work for the different heater?
would I die in a fiery ball of flames?
or just co2 poisoning?
what do ya think?

peace,
Thom
