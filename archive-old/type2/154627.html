Subject: Re: [T2] Spare Tire Cover Brand New Need to Sell

I don't understand, isn't a 195 bigger than a 185?

When I bought my bus it had 185/75-14 tires and when I checked my GPS against the speedometer it was off by 10mph.

When travelling down I5 with the speedometer at 70mph I was actually only going 60mph.

I put on the 196/75-14 tires and my speedometer is now correct at 70mph when checked against my GPS (which means better gas mileage by the way!!)

In order to travel faster at the same engine RPM the circumference of the tire must have increased, right?

Thank you,

James in Portland, Oregon




&gt; If it won't fit on a 195/75R14, it won't fit on a stock tire. The 195/75 
&gt; is actually smaller than the stock 185R14.
