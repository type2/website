&gt;&gt;Please excuse the intrusion, but I REALLY NEED HELP!!!!! My
&gt;&gt;man and I are
&gt;&gt;busy converting a 1974 (or thereabouts) VW Kombi from air to
&gt;&gt;water cooled.
&gt;&gt;Our problems are:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Kim - I sent you out a post but it bounced right back.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone else get thru?

No such subscriber, no such domain. No such domain as ICONO.CA either. Her
message was composed with Chameleon which argues that she posted from the
web page, where she might read replies. If it's not all a cruel joke.
