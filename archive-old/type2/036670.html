Subject: Lowered floor in Bus?

We were at my friend's VW shop today and we saw a
late 70's Bus with a lowered floor.  My kids said the middle
floor section was lowered about 4-5 inches.  It wasn't a pop-top,
but seemed to be a camper, although I'm not sure if it was
a Westy or some home brewed conversion.

Was a lowered floor a factory option, or was this a custom job?

Thanks
Dave
