call those flames) or stories at least (let me tell you what happened
when I used that old VW engine air compressor fer to paint my bus ...)


Well, you're up against good old PV=NRT.

Anytime you compress air you will raise its temperature.  In a &quot;normal&quot;
compressor the air has a chance to radiate its heat from the storage tank
and air hose.  With a Volksair, the volume is so great that the air stays
hot.

So, get a 500 gallon ASME rated tank, immerse it in cold water, and you
can get cold air from your Volksair!  :)
