        Hey There!
My stick shift in the 73 Westy has always been a little difficult to =
find 1st gear and downshifting into 2nd.
Driving to work i was looking at the shift pattern placard on the ash =
tray and noticed that the H is at a backwards slant.
Tried to shift in this pattern and all seems smooth as silk.
Obviously the bus was engineered to shift this way but having driven =
other makes of standard cars the slanted H feels weird.
Can anyone elaborate on this? Todd Hill?
Thanks
