Subject: Weber jetting questions

Hello Everybody!
    My name is Pete and I'm pretty new to the list. I'm 18 yrs.old and my 
1974 Westy is my first and only car.  I have a 1.8 and I am at sea level. 
I've never worked with carbs before. I just installed a Weber 32/36DFAV which 
I suspect is jetted rich.  Lastnight I opened it up to see what size jets are 
inside.                                                                       
                    #1.  I found the main primary to be a 137 and the 
secondary to be a 140. Should these be correct for a 1800cc at sea level?     
                                                                                
#2.  I also found two jets I don't know the name for, directly above the 
mains. There appears to be passages between these jets and the mains. These 
jets are marked 170 prim. and 180 sec. They were visible with the carb 
completely assembled.  Are these the air correction jets?                     
                               #    #3.  There was also a piece with two 
&quot;jets,&quot; one to each of the barrels. When I press on the throttle, gas squirts 
&gt;from these jets into the barrels.  This piece is marked 55.  What's the name 
of this piece?                                                                
                        #4.  Finally, I noticed two brass screws. One on the 
front, one on the back, each directly between the barrels and float bowl. 
They are located on the upper portion of the carb. The heads of these screws 
look like tin screws. Are these related to jetting?
    #5.  Is there anyone out there who could recommend jet sizes appropriate 
for a 1.8 at sea level?  Can anyone tell me what these pieces are based on my 
descriptions?
    Thanks for taking the time to read this post, 
                                
                                    Pete
