Subject: knock while driving in hot weather?

71 Westy 1600 Single....was driving yesterday in the heat and heard a knock 
while driving, came from the rear so i'm assuming it was the engine.

Haven't done a compression test yet, hopefull will do that soon.

Does this mean that my engine is ready for an overhaul ASAP, I was planning 
on driving it on an 8 hour trip this weekend and am not sure if maybe I 
should cancel because of this.

Could this have just been because it was so hot out and i was stuck in 
traffic for a short time?

thanks in advance,
Daniel
