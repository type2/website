Subject: [T2] still more on gas in oil

hello once again list,

this is the '77 2L FI hyd. lifter engine with gas in the oil again

i finally did a compression test. results are as follows:

1- 120
2- 130
3- 97      105
4- 97      105

the 2nd # for 3 &amp; 4 are after squirting oil in the spark plug hole.

sounds like bad rings on 3 &amp; 4 eh?  or is 97 still ok to run at. doesn't the
muir book say if squirting oil raises the reading that something's wrong
with the rings?

this is an AVP longblock with &lt;3000 miles under its belt. what gives?

anyways, after putting everything back together again, the engine won't
start. it spins nice and fast and starts to catch, but never stays running.
i got it to run once for about 1/2 a second. ARGH.

so can anyone tell me if i've got ring problems? or is it something else?
i don't have any more gas in the oil cuz i changed it and haven't driven
more than 10 mi.  i guess a fuel pressure gauge is next on my shopping list,
ought to check that out.

thanks so much for all the helpful replies. i did get the timing to advance
and return fairly consistently, without rebiulding the dizzy yet, tho i
prolly will anyways.

muchas gracias,
