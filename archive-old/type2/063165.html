Back when I rode my Honda CB350, EVERY motorcycle pilot waved at me.  
This threw me for awhile, but I caught on.

&gt; BTW, the same hold true for motorcycle owners. Harley owners usually 
&gt; wave only to other Harleys... and Honda cruisers don't wave to anyone 
&gt; unless they are &quot;driving&quot; a motorcycle (as opposed to riding one).
