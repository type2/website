I realize this is an old question(yes I looked at the archieves)but I'm
still confused.  I have a 72 with an engine that was rebuilt by the PO. 
Went to adjust valves this afternoon and found no play in any othe
valves...got me to thinking that maybe I had hydraulics.  Came in the
house...looked in the archieves and found a reference to pushrods.  It said
that hydraulics would be steel and solids aluminum.  BTW..the bus runs
great!  Any other way I can find out for sure what I have?  Thanks...this
is the best &quot;LIST&quot; I've seen.
