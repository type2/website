In addition to the various other suggestions that have been made, when
I had this sort of leak recently, it turned out that the O-ring that
goes onto the distributor shaft had gotten old, hard, and cracked.
This isn't something that's easy to see without removing the
distributor, since it's about an inch down into the engine.  One
symptom is that you end up with oil all around the distributor,
including (in extreme cases) on the fuel pump mounting block.
