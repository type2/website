Well I finally got around to removing the engine on Polly, the 1800 Orange
Devon.  I discovered that the small screw which connects the shift lever to
to the gear box, is really difficult to remove if it does not want to be
moved.  I have discovered that my jack is won't go low enough to remove the
engine simply (ask my mum she was holding it at the time).

Not content with removing the engine and gearbox I tried to remove the fuel
tank

Undid he screws (forgot about those two)

Undid the straps

Undid the breather hoses and loosened the inletand out

But it still won't come out, what am doing wrong?

thanks
