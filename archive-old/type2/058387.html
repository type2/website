&gt; 	My two questions are...is this easily fixed and...If the tranny

&gt; would hate to replace this stuff and go to restart it and snap it off

and
&gt; happens due to wear...

No happy news here, I'm afraid.  The gland nut either came loose (most
probable) or failed, allowing the flywheel to spin freely on the
crankshaft.  The dowel pins and holes are obviously trashed, which
cannot be fixed without removing the crankshaft from the engine. 
Depending upon how badly the crank and flywheel were mangled, a
machinist might be able to drill new dowel pin holes in the crank and
flywheel, or you might need new parts. In any case, a complete engine
teardown is needed.

On the flywheel side, it's possible that the pilot bearing is seized
to the pilot shaft.  Put the bus in 4th gear and twist the flywheel
back and forth. If there is some rotational play, then you might be
able to work the flywheel off.  Another approach is to have someone
depress the clutch pedal while you twist the flywheel back and forth. 
This puts spring pressure on the flywheel pushing it off of the
transmission.  Be warned that the flywheel might come at you with
considerable force if it breaks loose!  Be prepared!  Start with a
little pressure on the clutch pedal, not the pedal to the floor.

On a more positive note, there's a good chance that the transmission
might be OK, seeing as how the flywheel was detached from the engine.
Since the flywheel wasn't attached to the crankshaft any more, the
transmission wasn't getting any drive.  When you get the flywheel off,
put the clutch plate on the input shaft and see if you can feel for
the gears.

If you're looking for someone to blame, the person who last installed
the flywheel is a likely candidate.

Let us know how it goes!
