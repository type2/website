Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Rear Engine T1--&gt;T2 Mount Adapter

&lt;&lt; By reputation, they cause oil leaks. They are a plate that replaces the oil

pump cover plate. It provides the 3 mounting holes for the moustache bar.

Apparently the studs were never meant to hold that much pressure and torque

and eventually work loose. I suppose it is a way to use an otherwise

unusable earlier Bug Engine, but like most compromises...

My ol' 71 had a bug engine with that adaptor...It works, but I got to checkin'
the nuts on the studs (I used loc-tite when I mounted it, even...) on a weekly
basis...Lasted about three years, as did the used engine...YMMV
