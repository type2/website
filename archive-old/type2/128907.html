&gt;I can't find the thermostat.

It's under the #1/#2 cylinders. Here are all the parts:

&gt;I'd like to be sure that the PO was thorough in his/her demolition of
&gt;the cooling system before I start buying parts. Can I check for the
&gt;existence of flaps without pulling the fan housing?

There is a bar across the top of the engine just behind the fan shroud. If the flaps are there you should feel the resistance as you rotate the bar.

&gt;In the archives,
&gt;Steve Bartnik said that the fan housing can be removed without pulling
&gt;the engine. Has anyone done this? Is it any worse/easier than pulling
&gt;the ALT without pulling the engine?

The shroud is pretty heavy and lopsided with the alternator still attached. I'd remove that first.
