Subject: BN4 Heater for sale

Hello List,

I have a BN4 gas heater for sale - $450.

Like new condition, includes everything you need to
stay toasty this winter - fuel pump, glow plug, fresh
air tube, etc, etc.  Detailed installation instructions
included.  I can ship if you pay.

I mounted it under the bench seat of my '76 Westy
about 4 years ago.  It always kept me warm on the
coldest of NJ winter days.  My '69 has the same unit,
(stock in the engine compartment!) and it is a blessing.

I'll be parting out other pieces of the '76 as time permits.
If there's anything anyone needs, let me know.  Full
Westy interior, pretty much everything is up for grabs.
