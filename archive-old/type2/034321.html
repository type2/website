They have this stuff at your basic general FLAPS -- it's a length of
soft plastic in a U or circle shape that fits around the edges of your
doors, it's supposed to prevent that sort of thing.

Otherwise, my advice is leave the scene as quickly, quietly, and
furtively as possible (I'm kidding, I'm kidding!).
