Subject: Re: [T2] Oil filler tube to crankcase gasket and sealing
  method?

you can change this gasket from laying under bus but it wont be easy with the engine installed but can be done i have done this myself...
dont know the exact part number but can tell you the nuts there could be loose or you could need a new gasket...?
are you sure that the drip is coming from the gasket?
it could be running from the bottom of the filler tube cap... at the top....
mine once leaked from there and the cause was that i didnt have it lined up right in its little notch///with whatever it might be.....
i like to fix drips and leaks but sometimes they just need to mark there spot in other cases....
good luck
peace and love

small drip seems to be happening there on my bus.
