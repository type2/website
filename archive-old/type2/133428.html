&gt; think. The pan was slightly bent. I was checking it with a straight edge.
&gt; Afew precise wacks with a rubber mallot and it is more true now. I might be
&gt; looking for one later. Replaced the screen and gaskets. All of that went
&gt; smooth.
&gt;
&gt; Questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Is there supposed to be a gasket or seal under the cover for the govenor?

rubber ring in recess of govenor, have never seen one come out, never seen
one leak.  YMMV

&gt; 2. Recomendations on Hypoid Oil for the Final drive would be greatly
&gt; appreciated. GL4, GL5, Synthetic, Snake Oil, etc.

I use synthetic in my 78 auto bx

happy motoring

Bob
