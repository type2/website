&gt; The catch is... I don't know how well these will wear, nor how long they
&gt; will last.  My gut feeling says they should last quite a long time, as
&gt; HDPE is referred to as the Poor Man's Teflon. They *should* last quite
&gt; awhile, especially if you use a bit of good grease on 'em.  The plastic
&gt; I'm eyeballing is a UHMW HDPE, with oil impregnation.  It's designed to
&gt; be used for bushings.  I'm also looking at a better retention mechanisim
&gt; than screwing it in place.

How 'bout Vescanite... ?-)
