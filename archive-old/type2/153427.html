Subject: Re: [T2] Swivel seat base?

Ronnie, you wrong no way.  Bus you're right again.  I should have explained
better.  I saw one on the samba for sale and it gave me an idea for the
passenger seat in the Splitwindow.  Since I don't have a partition, thought it
would be neat to have the passenger side swivel around.  I've got Eclipse
seats in there now, but want to find some 300ZX or Supra seats.  Looks like it
wouldn't be to hard to do, the swivel bracket.

  I'm gonna guess this is for his split window. I could be wrong. It's
happened many times before.
