Subject: A Merry EuroWesty Christmas

Hi, Folks!

Thanks for the enthusiastic response!  It looks like the '70  
EuroWesty is going to have a new home soon after Christmas, a gift of  
a father to a stepson who could use a little holiday cheer in his  
life.  I don't know which of them is luckier: the father for having a  
lad like that in his life, or the son for having someone who cares so  
for him.

All the holiday's best to all of you out there in Air-cooled Search  
and Rescue!

					Bob
