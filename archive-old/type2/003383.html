Hi all you bus-fanatics,


My wife and I went away for some days, with our beetle 
(our type2 pick-up 1979 is still not on the road...) and when we got back...
there were 365 e-mail waiting on us .... did I read that night !

In order to install an 1800cc engine in our pick-up I will need a example of how the electrical wires should run. All the cables were cut off by some morom I bought the bus from.
I have been to the homepage of blasted bus (or something like that) I'am not able to print these schedules... Who can help me out ?? Maybe some1 could send them by mail ?

Please react via: hoogersp_at_worldonline.nl

Thank you all !
