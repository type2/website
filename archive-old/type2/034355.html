Subject: Valve Adjustment Nuts.

Greetings, and Happy Y2K.

While adjusting the valves on my 1915DP, I noticed that a couple of nuts
weren't rotating on the screws very cleanly, making that final torque take
the screw with it, tightening the adjustment without my consent.

I went to the specialty bins at the hardware store, and found some nuts
hardened to &quot;8.8&quot; something-or-the-other. These nuts are also thicker than
the ones that were on my motor, making for a better grip with the 13mm
tools. They rotated very cleanly on the adjustment screws, and made the
final tightening process foolproof. I figure they also have more thread area
to clench the screw with - that being a good thing.

Q1 - Is that a good thing?
Q2 - Do the standard nuts have a tendency to strip internally?
Q3 - Are the nuts I bought (.45 cents each!) going to get me home tonight?
I've taken it 30 miles without anything starting to rattle. What does the
&quot;grade 8.8&quot; mean?
Q4 - Will the bit of extra weight (thicker nuts) cause any problems that we
can think of?

I actually like the look of these new nuts to the point where I'm thinking
of getting a complete set for my next adjustment.

Thanks -
