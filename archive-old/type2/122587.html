&gt; Has anyone used regular home carpet in their bus? How did you bind the free

&gt; 
I used some remnants of some industrial carpet that was being used in a
school.  I first put down 1/4&quot; CDX plywood securely with some heavy duty
screws and then laid down some heavy duty contact cement for carpets with
the old trowel method.  For the edges I used a wood baseboard trim piece for
along the drivers side wall.  Along the slider I used a piece of metal trim
that 1/2 covers the carpet, 1/2 is off the carpet &amp; this was screwed into
some pre-drilled holes (sheet metal screws) along that lip of metal where
the sliding door sits when closed.  The small vent metal piece that sits
where the heat comes out by the back of the front seats covers the end of
the carpet in that location &amp; underneath the z-seat I wasn't too worried
about it.  I am sorry I have no pictures at this moment but if you need some
better details email me directly.  All the supplies sans the carpet came
from Lowes hardware.
