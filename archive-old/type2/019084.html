Subject: Re: Heater flapper boxes - seals?

Dave,
This summer I took the heater control boxes off my 72 because one was blowing
heat into the cab even after I disconnected it.  I discovered that the little
flappers inside are spring loaded and lined with some sort of material other
than metal.  Maybe asbestos?  My problem:  The rivet that  holds the flappers
in place inside the control boxes had wore out and wasn't allowing the flappers
to seal properly.  I fixed the problem by drilling out the old rivet and
replacing it with a machine screw and lock nut, being sure to leave enough play
so the spring loaded flapper could move around as needed.  After the fix, I
bench tested the control boxes and found that the spring loaded flappers seal
exceptionally well.  There are two spring loaded flappers inside each control
box so that when the heat is turned on all available hot air gets routed to the
heater system for the bus.  When the heat is turned off no hot air can enter
the bus, and some or maybe all of it is routed to the outside of the bus.

Assuming the cables are properly adjusted, a good test of the heating system is
to turn the heat off and see if there is any hot air coming out of the heating
ducts inside the bus.  No hot air - flappers sealing fine.  Hot are entering
the buss - flappers not sealing completely.
I am assuming the heater control boxes are essentially the same between 72 and
79, I'm not totally sure.

Hope this helps,

&gt; I noticed when I fitted my new heater flapper boxes (a year ago) that there
&gt; was no seal of any description on the flaps or openings inside.  This didn't
&gt; seem right to me - even with the heater fully on there is just metal to
&gt; metal contact and a small gap for air to leak out.  Should there be some
&gt; sort of rubber or foam in there?
