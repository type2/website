You said...

&gt;But look, UK people help me with this:

&gt;It says here you can get a 34 PICT-4 which is not available in the US but
&gt;is just what we think, a late carb for a 1600, for L99, which would be
&gt;something around $88 US? Did I get that right?

I suggest you mail em at

sales_at_justkampers.co_dot_uk

They are good, supply on time and give discounts for club members...No I 
don't work for them!!!
