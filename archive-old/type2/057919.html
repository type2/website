 Nikki Pedersen is looking for .......
  
 
 &lt;&lt; My 1970 bus is having major surgery and needs 
 a  *German* clutch  crosshaft. Dr. Mechanic says 
 he  can't find one yet.   &gt;&gt;

Guess he's not looking hard enough as I have plenty
good used O.E.M.s and new aftermarket ones here.

Most VW wrecking yards in your neck of the woods
should have ooodles of '68-'70 trannies for parts and
most VW FLAPS should carry the aftermarket ones.
Around $25??  

If you can't locate one just email me and I can ship 
one out.
