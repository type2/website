Subject: Re: [T2] dash vents

From: &quot;Stephen and Jimmie Byers&quot; &lt;byersinc_at_swbell_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Anyone have a good source for the round vent/louver  found in the dash...

Well, if there's not, and I can figure out how to remove them from Giacomo
without breaking them in the process... :O)

Actually, a reality check would be that I'm waiting on an order of RTV and
black resin to come in before the end of the month.  I've got plans to have
most of the VW repros that are in various stages of progress, into molds by
then.  I can add both sets of vents if there's enough RTV to go around.
