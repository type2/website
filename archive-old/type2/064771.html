Subject: disc brakes?

hey all,
I may be dreaming, but I'm just curious.  How would one go about fitting
disc brakes on the rear of his '78 bus?  Would it be possible to go to
the junkyard, steal the front rotors from a late bus and slap them on
the rear of my bus?  Is this a bolt-up or are there other
considerations?  Where would the caliper mount?  What about the master
cylinder?  Would it have to be changed?  

This will probably never happen as it would be $$$expensive but I hate
jerking around with drum brakes.

Sean
