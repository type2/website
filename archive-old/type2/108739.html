Subject: RE: [T2] Tailgaters

&gt;&gt;What do you do when they're too close for comfort, especially at speed?


When I worked at the Associated Press in DC one of my editors did something
truly evil yet very satisfying. He rigged up a switch on his dash that
connected to his brake lights so when someone rode his butt, he'd flick the
switch and light up his brakelights and watch as the tailgater quickly fell
behind. Eventually they'd get the idea. I've been thinking of maybe doing
this once I get my Westy on the road since keeping momentum up is priority
number one and the switch thing could be the answer.
