&gt; This is just an update.  I have begun trying to drop my engine. Have 
&gt; questions about removing excellerator cable and fuel line/injecter. I don't 
&gt; have easy acess to the internet. The phone number for the hotel that I will 
&gt; be staying at for the next few days is 843-538-3600 and I am in room 141.  

if you are dropping only the engine then unhook the accelerator cable at
the throttle body, if dropping enginne and tranny together you can drop
them both about half way without taking offthe accelator cable. if
dropping all the way togethere you take the tiny c clip off the pin on the
linkage on the passenger side of the tranny, then take em apart at the
throttle body when it is on the ground

leave injectors attached aand discontect BOTH fueel lines under the bus in
front of the engine tin.

DON'T forget you MUST remove the coil, and oil filler tube before dropping
the engine, trust me you MUST remove the coil completely it will not clear
the apron.

before you can pull the engine tranny apart you also MUST takee the three
bolts off of the torque convertor thru the little hole in the engine
flange near the upper drivers side motor bolt.  use a deep 13mm socket and
DON'T lose em they are not interchangable with anything

good luck
