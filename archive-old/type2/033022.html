Hello collective wisdom -

This is my first time posting, but I suspect you will see several more
from me in the upcoming months.  I have somewhat recently acquired a huge
project in a '77 bus and seem to be finding 2 projects for every
one that I complete.

Currently my situation is my steering column is locked and I can't get the
baby to start.  This would be fine if it was in my driveway where I could 
focus some time on it, but it is at a supermarket and I sort of need to
get it out of there.  I've checked the archive from several computers and
there seems to be exactly the information that I need, but the site is
getting Vbrun errors or something similar so I can't view a lot of the
info that I need.  Can anyone help me with a quick fix?  I only need to
move her about a mile so that I can focus some time on the problem. 

I greatly appreciate any assistance.

Thanks.
=-Eric
