For some reason, I've been talking way too much recently.  :P  

But this just caught my eye, and I can't.. I just can't help myself!  I... I...

I can quit any time I like.  Really.

Anyhow...

&gt;Ok... after  about 3 months with my 80 Vanagon and lurking on the list I
&gt;have found several things:

&gt;2. The notch on my dizzy (009) is NOT lined up with the 1st cylinder firing
&gt;point. (It's lined up with #2) Is this a real problem? (The van runs pretty
&gt;good)

On an '80 Vanagon...  That's a 2.0L, right?  Or is it one of those wierd
aluminum-case uprights?  (I've always kind of wanted one of those...)

Does anyone remember if the #3 cylinder needs to be retarded on his engine?  If
so, the simple thing to do is loosen the distributor and twist it until the
notch lines up with #1.  Right?  

If not, no biggie.
