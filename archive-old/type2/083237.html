Subject: anti-seize

one list member described how anti-seize would gum up
on the spark plugs.  i work in the power industry and
we use the antizeize all the time.  when used
correctly i have never noticed this to occur although
i'm not saying it can't occur.  when using it on the
car i buy the high temp copper anti-seize and use just
enough to do the job, never over do it as you will
just create a mess.  i believe that this would have
saved many a head from having the threads strip out if
everyone were to do this.  i also use it on my exhaust
bolts and since i have been doing it i have never had
any problems getting the nuts off.  as far as throwing
your torque values off, he is correct in this to a
point but that would be with anything you add to a
bolt, nut, fitting, etc.
