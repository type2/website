Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

Hi Jason,

You shouldn't have a problem with rubber or cork.  Just make sure all
surfaces are clean and dry. If you are having problems, you might want to
check the valve covers for dents or warpage and check bail tension.

Do I understand that you are reusing gaskets to save money? At 89 cents a
throw it seems hardly worth it, but if you are what you might do is continue
to reuse but put in a new when one does leak -- best of both worlds.

Again, Bus Depot sells them for 89 cents. When I have reused a gasket
because a I didn't have a new one, I've had good luck cleaning it with
gasoline and wiping it dry before installing.

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I adjusted my valves yesterday and put my valve covers on upside down to
&gt; keep the gaskets compressed evenly (I swap them this way each time I do my
&gt; valves).  Today when I parked in a space that was on a steep sidehill, I
&gt; came out to find oil dripping out of my 1 &amp; 2 side valve cover.

&gt; Does anybody know of a good source for perfect-fitting, perfect-sealing
&gt; valve cover gaskets?
