Subject: AC in Southern Buses

There are some seriously spoiled folks out there.  :-)

My first car was a 65 B**tle with Mark IV AC.  Sucked engine power and  
took up space, so I removed it.  I was 16 years old, living in Palm Beach  
County, FL.  Hot, muggy.  My second car was an MG with no AC and black  
interior - same locale.  Back in 1977 we installed a dealer DPD AC unit in  
a 71 bus, again, PB County -- but mainly for reduced wind and road noise  
on trips.  Compressor died in 1980 and no one was very interested in  
replacing it.  I've owned 2 non-VWs with AC units that ate it, and I  
didn't fix them.  None of my other old VWs has it.  I currently live in  
Tallahassee, which is slightly cooler than South FL but gets no  
seabreeze.  When I was a kid, we had no AC in the house at all.  In  
Florida.

Yes, I wish I could be cool and dry on the road.  But AC is a drug that  
the power companies' investors are happy to have you hooked on.  It's done  
more to wreck Florida than anything else besides stupidity and greed (to  
which it is akin).  Homes that are designed to work without AC are  
livable, else there wouldn't be so danged many carbon units infesting the  
creator.  It's &gt;&gt;&gt;NOT&lt;&lt;&lt; necessary!  It just feels good.  Like cocaine.

(I could go on, and do, in &quot;The Freon Jones&quot; at  
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/fiction/freonjon.html.)
