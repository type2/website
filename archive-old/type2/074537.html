blue
bay Westy come out of the parking lot from the Eldridge hotel. :o)
I'm not sure what horse that what Wendy and Dan rode in on? hehhehee =20
But Dan Buser owns an awesome early early bug that just got painted =
cherry red.
They were up in Lawrence at a toy show from where they live in KC and =
Matthew was up to shop so we all hooked up.........so far I thought =
Bryant and I were the only bus listees from Lawrence......

WOW Sean Bartnick, that sounds SO familiar!
Did you go to KU Sean?
I had a blast and got my friend Phil at Free State to take a group =

of us and I got pics of Matt's bus. :o)

Good Food, Good VW Friends/talk,

&gt;Hey all,
&gt;I'm in Lawrence, KS on business and today I'm seeing a larger than =
usual
&gt;number of Buses around.  We've got an orange and white late bay in =
front of
&gt;the Free State brewpub, a grey/primer split across the street in front =
of
&gt;the candle shop and I just saw a blue early bay Westy come out of the
&gt;parking lot behind the Eldridge hotel.  Some sort of Bus event I didn't
know
&gt;about?  Anyone on the list?
&gt;
&gt;This seems an unusual concentration of Buses for a one-block area :-)
&gt;
