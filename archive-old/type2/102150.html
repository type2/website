&gt; seems to mount in the block on top at the base of cyl. 3 right were the tin
&gt; ends. from the fit of things, I would say that the mystery hose from the Y
&gt; in the pipe going to the brake booster goes to this temp switch (mystery
&gt; part) and then the EGR valve. Not to say this is correct, but it appears
&gt; that it was connected this way in the past.

Ah, the smudge that is item #36 in this diagram. Now I know what it is I can
see that Bentley has a better picture on page 32 of the FI chapter.

&gt; Now, I am not sure of where to connect the vacuum retard from the
&gt; distributor?

Previously I posted:

&gt; I think in general the hose from the outer nipple on the vacuum can is the
&gt; advance side and goes into the throttle body and is tee'd at the EEC valve
&gt; on the air cleaner.
&gt; 
&gt; The inner one, the retard side, tees into right side of the air distribution
&gt; box between 3/4 cylinders where the hose goes to the pressure regulator.
