&gt;at 180 back the rotor points to number 3 not 2 and the valve is
&gt;super tight at 180 back.  so we moved the crank until the rotor pointed at
&gt;the number 2 plug wire but that's only 90 rotor and pulley degrees not 180
&gt;Rick

remove valve covers and distributor cap, lay under the number 3 valves while your buddy
turns the motor with the velvet monkeywrench. at some point exhaust and intake will sigh
in happiness as the exhaust rocker comes all the way out and for one moment they will
hang there together before the intake rocker starts it's journey inward.
 At that precise moment you've achieved the bliss of TDC at number one. Do it a few times
till you sure, consult the book for a better description.

when you achieve that beautiful moment, come back around and see where your rotor is
pointing. That's going to be your own special #1 spot until five years from now when your
buddy buys a distributor drive puller. So just make sure the #1 wire comes into the cap right
on top of where that rotor is pointing, and fill in the other wires on the cap accordingly [1-4-3-2].
now loosen the distributor clamp, and swing the distributor around so the notch is just before
where the rotor points to #1, tighten the clamp just a bit so it's hard to turn the distributor but not
impossible, reinstall the valve covers and distributor cap and battery strap and key in one notch
hook up timing light and turn distributor slightly til test light comes on, then a bit more if you have an
009, remove test light and run up and turn motor on or off before you fry your condensor, warm up
come back and tighten the distributor clamp or power time it if you have an 009 by driving it around
the 30 bay windows, then stopping to tweak the distributor a bit each time till it feels smooth, then
finally check total advance to make sure you're not too advanced with the strobe light, or if its a stock
distrib you're already done.
