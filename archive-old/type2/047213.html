Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Cable Replacement

&gt; After you make sure that you got the right cable, be sure to order another
&gt; one for the parts box.  Very nice to have one there when the old one
&gt; breaks

Good advice. The cable that came with my Bus had 3 washers on the end
because of stretch (I assumed).  I bought a new one and it had the exact
same problem - too long. So I still have 3 washers at the end of my cable.
Don't recall its length I assumed If I ordered  a cable for a 1978 Bus it
would fit (RMMW). Does anyone know what length cable I should have for a1978
Bus?
