WHOA!  what kind of canoe is that???, my big old 17ft Grumman only weighs
81lbs!  

&gt; this rack and I'm pretty certain it could be done completely without
&gt; welding if need-be. A few modifications would bring the price down
&gt; considerably--below $70.00, I'm sure.

I put plumbing insulation foam on the gunwals and pull mine tight down on
the roof, rides better than any rack I ever had, AND I get about 1/2 mpgal
better gas mileage

maybe spent 20 bucks on it 7 years ago

lets go canoeing sometime and compare racks

on the Potomac, or Gunpowder, or Patuxent, or Thames Street after a hard
rain!
