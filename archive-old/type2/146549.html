I guess Terry K hasn't read a newspaper in a few years. Darn near 
everybody in the country, as well as the country itself, is spending 
money they don't have.

In my dictionary, &quot;loser&quot; is defined as someone who has the time, the 
skills, and the interest to make something for him or herself, but 
doesn't do so because of fears about keeping up with the Joneses (which 
is what most store-bought &quot;quality&quot; is about).

A few hours spent reading &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; 
usually helps losers see how they can be winners ...
