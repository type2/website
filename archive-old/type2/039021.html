Subject: Short trip to the NQ bus farm   I saw his sister in person NA-NE-NA-NE-BOO-BOO

I saw NQ's sister in the flesh/person   OK She did not have overalls on but
was fine anyway     Sorry no pictures that I can show you!!!!
Obligatory VW content
    Got up Sunday morning after going out Sat night and left Omaha for
Beatrice(Home of NQ) at 10 AM straight up.  Justin and a bunch of VW books
and manuals and Justin's Wagon Works go-cart plans are in the back seat of
my 74 Standard Yellow bug.  After getting to I-80 sucked in behind a semi
and made it to Lincoln in about 45 minutes Turned to Highway 77 and got to
Beatrice(population ****** Home of NQ sign on the water tower) at 11:20?
(90 miles in 80 minutes......pretty good for a $250 purchase....1/2 tank of
gas)  Everything is so green on the drive down there   Was very nice
drive!!!!  NQ is in the garage as we pull up and is in a working
frenzy....Pull the 66 tranny....BS......Clean the suburban to haul the
tranny...BS......put suburban stuff in the garage....BS......Clean the
tranny fluid that spilt out the boots that were never on the road.  I looked
at where the crack was and the rubber could not of been thicker than 2
sheets of paper  Said made in Germany though.  Load the tranny up and drive
to Taco Johns for lunch.  BS    Go over to NQ's G-PA's garage and there is
the new 67 bus with the beautifully done POR-15 floor and a beautiful front
end all done on the bus.  The bus is nice but has the scrapes and scratches
of a impounded bus(Ask NQ about that story) but is a Deluxe and is very
there!!!  We get to business as Justin goes out in the rain and removes the
boots from the 67 axle out in the yard to put the boots on the freshly
rebuilt 66 as NQ and I get the torn boots of the 66 and get the tools and
engine compartment readied for installation.  Put the old better boots on
and then every thing goes in pretty easy.  Had to use a big old C clamp to
get the spring plates to lay down at the same angle as the reduction boxes
so that the bolts would line up but no knuckle busters or words to make a 14
year old smile.  Very smooth installation.  About 5 NQ says lets go for ice
cream so we grab the books that I brought down and headed for Dairy Queen
and for a hour BS'ed, looked at my Type II manual(Thanks Steven Howell) and
the 50 years of the bus book and Justin's plans for a go-cart built into a
Radio Flier wagon  Left Beatrice about 6;30, tucked in behind a semi and got
home about 8 dead tired.  Justin napped the whole way home so I got to take
a quick nap before I went to bed.  Pictures at NQ's site at

NQ is a great guy and a fun guy to hang out with!!!!   He really is as witty
as his writings  ;^{)
