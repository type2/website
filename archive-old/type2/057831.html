Subject: Engine judder at certain speeds

Hi,

My engine starts to judder at certain speeds: in 4th gear between 50 - 55 mph, in 3rd gear between 40 - 45 mph (usually when under load, like goind up hill). No judder at any other speeds.

Anyone seen this before? I thought it was overheating, but the engine seems to be running cool: I can touch the fan casing without burning myself. Is it the clutch? I don't experience any problems when taking my foot off of the clutch pedal.

Regards,
Paul
