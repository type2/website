Subject: Re: dizzyness: fear  (correct angle for the dist drive gear)

&gt;A lot of dist misalignments are caused by old timers (like me) who have
&gt;worked on a lot of T1 engines using the same spec on T4's, then wondering
&gt;why the vac can runs into something.
&gt;

Another problem is that a lot of cheapo rebuilt Bus dizzies are actually in
Bug housings, sometimes with mixtures of Bug and Bus parts.  Vacuum cans
will again end up in odd places.  Strictly speaking any VW dizzy
practically will work in a T4 bus if you time it right but it won't
necessarily run well or fit nicely.
