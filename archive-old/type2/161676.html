Subject: which stud for my exhaust

I need to replace an exhaust stud on my
1700 fi motor.
I don't have the stud out yet but would like
to pick up some before I take it apart.
The year of the motor is decieving since it
was in a 78 for a while and who knows before that.
It's now in a 74 westie.

Thanks
James
