Subject: Re: [T2] Does the grim reaper drive a bus?

I have a friend who is an accident investigator for the insurance 
companies.  This friend doesn't own a bus but is the one who helped Nikki 
Elko out in San Angelo after the deer hit her bus (so he's okay).  I asked 
him if he would comment on his thread - here is his reply:

========================================================================
You might be able to find stats at the National Highway Transportation and
Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.  I will see if there are any other
sources.

I will comment on relative safety of older vehicles, and I don't think that
this will be any revelation to anyone.  The modern car is FAR superior to an
older car as far as safety is concerned.  Safety technology has come a LONG
way in just the past ten years.  Airbags, side impact beams, anti-lock
brakes, deformable/energy absorbing structure, seat belt improvements, fuel
cutoff switches and fuel tank rollover cutoff valves all work together to
provide a safer vehicle than what was even imaginable in the not too far
past.  Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy older cars, I have a 1970
Chevelle and a 1969 Torino.  But, I know that my 1991 Explorer and my 1995
Civic are safer overall.  Also, don't forget vehicle handling/dynamics as a
safety feature with regards to accident avoidance.

I'm sorry to sound grim, and I am not discouraging anyone from driving their
bus.  But, at least for me, I know that when I drive my classic cars that I
am accepting lower safety/protection compared to more modern cars.   Please
also remember that no matter how safely or carefully you drive, you cannot
predict every possible danger.

Dammit, now I'm starting to sound like the Grim Reaper himself!

&gt;I should think the relatively low insurance rates for the buses says 
&gt;something about how safe they are. Or maybe you just can't do much damage 
&gt;in a vehicle that slow...
