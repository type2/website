Subject: Re: [T2] Engine won't idle after top end rebuild - need help
  troubleshooting

Depends on how closely the pushrods match. He said he did his best. They 
are the saem and not 1/8&quot; different - right? I mean wouldn't valves with 
different lifts cause a bad idle?

Asking a question here, not flaming anyone.

Thanks!



&gt;I doubt that any of this is causing your bus to run poorly.  There *may* 
&gt;be other issues that come up in the future if the parts don't play well 
&gt;together, but if the valves are opening and closing when they should, this 
&gt;is not the source of your current problem.  For the rest of the list: 
&gt;There is nothing wrong with making your own pushrods - it is done all the 
&gt;time.  One of those &quot;not rocket science&quot; things.
