Subject: Re: [T2] Driving with a bad valve

It's the old saying &quot;Do you feel lucky&quot; if the seat
drops and jams the valve it will take out the piston,
cylinder, possibly the rod and crankshaft. If you have
it towed home it can't damage anymore than is already
done. the difference being a simple head change or
repair of the old one or a complete overhaul or
possibly getting a whole new engine if it blows real
good. I vote for the roll-back for the transportation
home. Phil
