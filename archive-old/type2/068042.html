Subject: Plugs &amp; Compression testing

Here's a question that's been bugging me for quite some time.  I almost
feel silly asking it, but I figure that questions are the root of all
knowledge...  :-)

1) When changing plugs, I've alway been told it is best to do it on a
   COLD ENGINE to reduce the risk of stripping the head.  Okay, simple enough
   to swap plugs on a cold engine...

2) When checking cylinder compression, I'm always been told to do it on a WARM
   ENGINE.  This is obviously correct, since only when the engine is warm will
   tolerances be correct, etc, etc.

So you see the source of my confusion.  The two rules are mutually exclusive.

Does this mean then that it is *preferable* to pull plugs from a cold
engine, but that I shouldn't particularly worry when removing them from a
warm one?  Does it mean that the temperature of the motor is in no way
associated with likelihood of plug stripping?  Have I just been feed a load
of hooey about when it's best to pull the plugs?

And, *yes*, I do use anti-sieze religiously on the spark plug threads...
