Subject: 2 litre timing and parts

Hi
        Having just acquired my first bus(76 camper) in 17 years
(previously had a 71 and 67 bus), and wanting to do all my own maintenance
as I used to, I've struck a bit of a problem finding correct info for the
timing. After consulting Muir, Bently, VW shops, and various www sites I've
come up with somewhere between 7.5BTDC and 5ATDC for my 2 litre MANUAL
trans motor(CJ). From what I can work out most of the 76 2 litre engines in
the US were auto trans(7.5 BTDC) but here in Australia there were also
manuals , which some info suggests should be 5ATDC. I have never worked on
anything over 1600 previously so any help would be much appreciated.
    While I'm at it;  I've got 3 of these 2 litre engines all of which I
intend to recondition over a period of months/years/decades (please delete
those you do not feel applicable) and I'd be interested in any info
regarding good reliable places to buy pistons, barrels,etc either here in
Australia or the US ( or anywhere else for that matter). Prices in this
country tend to be to far over the top at times so I'm open to suggestions.
	Thanks for your time
			Neil
