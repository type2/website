Ok there are two things...

1. On a local radio station, they play what they call &quot;Twisted Tunes,&quot;
which are parodies of real songs.  They have a parody of the song &quot;What if
God Was One of Us&quot; that they switched to &quot;What if God Smoked Cannibis.&quot;
One of the lines is:

What if God smoked cannibis
And drove a tie-die Micro Bus

Pretty funny song.

2. I was watching tv the other day and saw a 1-800-call-att ad that had a
kid in a garage playing guitar while standing behind a splittie.  They
only show the bus for a second, so I can't make out what sort of shape
it's in, but it's there if you look for it.
