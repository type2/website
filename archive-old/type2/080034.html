Subject: Re: Unknown Dist - Final, look at it and comment, please! (fwd)

Volks,

This is a follow-on to the discussion last week on timing a VW with a
random or unknown distributor.  A couple of blanket statements were tossed
out by a couple of people, including myself.  David Schwarze challenged my
answer and I went to do a quick look-see and confirm that it was true.
Well, as you know, that quick look was an entry into a morase :-(  What I
said is *not* true!  Sorry :-(  The whole subject of getting spark to the
cylinder at the right time turns out to be *very* complex and ties into
the concept of the powerplant being designed as a system.  Randomly
replacing parts of that system will affect other parts in strange and
(usually) negative ways,

After looking at the list of distributors and trying to make sense of it
in any number of ways, I decided to limit the analyis as follows... First,
I ditched the &quot;can also run&quot;, replacement, and mechanical-only
distributors...  I am not covering any dist that was not stock on
*something* at time of manufacture.  Second, I am only interested in
whether it is safe to run, not if it will have the exact advance curve you
need.  As a result, I took the beginning point and added/subtracted all
the mechanical and vacuum advances and retards to come up with a maximum
advance figure.  The chart at the bottom of this post lists my results.
The results were interesting, to say the least.  The most important result
that turned up is that maximum advance (in buses) seems to be related to
case and displacement as follows:

Displacement   Max Advance (at 3500 RPM)
1200           38
1300           35.5
1500           35
1600           38
1700           48
1800           45
2000           46

So it looks like in buses T1 cases take ~35 max and that the
T4 take ~45 max.  The only common threads I can think of are that
the 1200-1500 were single port and that the 1600 and later are dual port.
An additional finding is that automatics, whether autostick or straight
automatic time 2-4 degrees lower at max advance.  Maybe automatics run a
bit hotter and the retard cools them a bit?

At this point, I cannot figure a single general rule, but I propose the
following:

1)  Stock is good.  Run the stock settup if you can.

2)  If you are stuck with an unknown dist and need to get home with it,
    time it at 32 degrees max advance at 3500 RPM in a T1, 44 degrees max
    advance at 3500RPM in a T4 then check your oil temps a couple times on
    the way home.

If you want to play with non-stock distributors in your bus, take along a
couple of temp gagues (head and oil) and a couple vacuum gauges (manifold
and ported vacuum) and be careful for the first couple thousand miles!

My thanks to Karl von Salzen, Darrell Boehler, Jamie Rivers, Bob, David
Schwarze, George Lyle, Mark, and Andy for all their help! and Ian Bond for
starting the thread :-)
