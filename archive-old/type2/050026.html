&gt; I need the 2 pieces of engine tin UNDER the vehicle for my '79...  Would
&gt; the '80 fit?  Already checked out the tin on the '77, and it's
&gt; different...


No, Vanagon tin will NOT fit a 79. 79 used two different left side tube tin.
Federal version used 72-74 tin. Cal version used 79 Cal-only tin. The right
side is 72-74.
Fed version left heater boxes are one piece like the right.
Cal version left side has a seperate manifold w/cat converter between it and
the box.
I believe I have both pieces.
