Subject: The never-ending tyre thread (was Contis)

The reinforced tire meets specs. A LR 'C' tire is probably adequate. A
LR 'D' tire is definitely better.
LR 'C' = 6 ply rating. LR 'D' = 8 ply rating. I've run all three and the
LR 'D' tire is a *truck* tire. Was the best of the bunch.  However, with
that said, if money is an object (as it is with me), a LR 'C' or
Reinforced tire works much better than a passenger car tire. The LR 'D'
tire just wasn't worth the doubled price TO ME. (I Currently have
Kirkland LT195/75-14 LR C tires on the Riviera and Uniroyal Larado
LT195/75-14 LR C (1435# _at_ 50psi) tires on the Vanagon. The Vanagon is
due and I'll probably buy the Contis for it.)

Interesting...  I just went searching for the inflation data for the
Kirklands and while I didn't find it I did find that they are
manufactured by Michelin. Curious. Maybe I'll go get another set of
them. They're wearing well.

BTW, have you looked at &lt;http://www.everybus_dot_com/dworkin/tires/continental1_op.html&gt;?

Ya pays yer money and takes yer choice.
