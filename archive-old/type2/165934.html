Subject: Re: [T2] Using smoke to find vacuum leaks

i used a pump for inflatables.... one end the hose can suck the other end the hose blows...
   
  i put the end that blows in the end of the tail pipe and ducted it up for a good connection but easy removal and then turned it on layed under the bus and felt with my hand where i could feel air coming out and i actually found lots of places that are now tach welded better and sealed......
   
  good luck..

  Using a smoker, Why not leave the engine off and find a way to attach a 
shop vac cleaner hose to the airbox, say at the s hose connection- these 
have variable speed and can be reversed to create positive flow- My 
daughter has super ears and can &quot;hear&quot; sucking air sounds ....
