Subject: Updated Website

I have updated my website as I now have no banners.
Of general interest would be the 70 westy brochure page in the literature 
section
It does have a neat PIC of the 70 westy tent in 1970 on a beach in California.
General stuff on my 70 westy, unfortunately I cannot find a photo before I 
got it painted, when it was Californian faded red.
