&gt; &gt;&gt; The Weasel?  :^D sorry.  I couldn't resist!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; I guess I need to explain.
&gt; 
&gt; Weasel is just my inprogress nickname.You see..once there was a time that I 
&gt; wanted
&gt; a ferret (that little weasel). I finially got one and all it would do is 
&gt; BITE me.
&gt; 
&gt; Then there is the time I wanted a baywindow VW bus. I finally got one and 
&gt; all it does is BITE me.
&gt; I was so excited to get that bus for just $600. Ran (runs) good, not bad bus 
&gt; body.
&gt; But I didn't pay a lot of attention to the PO's creative ways. It turns out 
&gt; that the bus is almost &quot;good condition.&quot; I'll give it a proper name when it 
&gt; deserves it.
&gt; 
&gt; Bus Content: I am wondering if anyone could describe how the air flow for 
&gt; the heater is directed? That is to say, if the cooling fan directs air through 
&gt; the heat exchangers then what is the heater fan in the engine compartment 
&gt; for? 
&gt;
