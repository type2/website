 Subject: [T2] Grinding Noise in 75 Westy Tranny


Hi There!

My friend has a 75 Westy with something strange going on.  When he takes
off,
there is a terrible spinning, grinding noise in the tranny that also affects
acceleration.  This isn't noticeable in 3rd or 4th.

Here's the kicker.  They took it to a mechanic who supposedly put in a used
tranny but they still have the same problem.  This mechanic has now
installed
2 used trannies to no avail.  I'm going over tommorrow afternoon to drop the
motor and tranny and take a look.

Does anyone have any suggestions on where to start looking?

Thanks in advance,
Erich Elmer
