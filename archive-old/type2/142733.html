Subject: Re: [T2] KYB Gas-a-justs shocks

&gt; Next step, put the back shocks on tonight and
&gt; consider an oversized front sway bar in the
&gt; future.

Well, like I've said before, I like the KYBs on the back. With the
original oil filled shocks up front the bus feels nicely balanced. I'd
like to try the KYBs on the fronts too. But that will have to wait for
the 71 to hit the road since I'm getting the Konis for the GWB.

As for the sway bar, maybe Richard will sell you the one he took off his bus?
