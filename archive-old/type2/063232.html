Subject: 009 in a pancake

Sorry about the lack of quotes, I get the digest.  But Arthur Morris was 
considering putting a 009 distributor in his 77 fuel injected pancake.  
One of his concerns was the relationship between engine position, points, 
timing, and the distributor cap.  Dennis Gentry, among others,  described 
the solution well.

But my experience is that the 009 is the wrong distributor.  When I 
rebuilt my 76 I put in a 009.  When I was done I could not get the car to 
start at all!  Trial and error led me to put in the original vacuum 
advance distributor and it started right up.  So I looked up the 009 in 
the catalog (either the Bus Stop or GEX) and it said under it &quot;for all 
carburated engines up to 1974.&quot;  In other words, it is OK in a pancake, 
but not in a fuel injected pancake.  The only thing I could figure is 
that the condenser screws up the FI.

Well, a local VW guru (Jim Hayes, Aspen CO, one of the great ones) had a 
050.  He said the 050 was for the 76 and later FI pancakes.  Since he was 
a beetle guy, we swapped.  So I put in the 050.  After about 5K miles, 
the van died.  I examined the plug wires, and they had been oxidized to 
blue copper oxide, and crumbled.  I replaced the wires, and it still did 
not start.  So I put in the old distributor, and it started. 

OK, I thought, maybe Mr. Hayes put in a carburator's condenser on the 
050.  So I put on a new condenser, put the 050 back in, and it ran fine 
for a while.  Then it would not idle smoothly.  So for the third time, I 
put in the old one, and it ran fine.

The bottom line?  Stick with a vacuum advance on an FI pancake.  Muir 
says it himself, tucked away in some later chapter.  Maybe in 
&quot;Suggestions and New Ideas&quot; ?  He says he likes the 009, but stick with 
the original in the later vans.

Just my two scents worth.
Jess
