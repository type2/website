&gt; 
&gt; I apologize in advance for the sketchy details...
&gt; My cousin blew the engine on her '78 Westy and bought a factory rebuilt
&gt; engine to replace it.  The shop installing it said it was a different type
&gt; of engine-though manufactured a few months apart-and had to modify it a bit
&gt; to get it to fit.  After much frustration they now cannot get it to
&gt; run-something about the ground or the computer reading &quot;shut down fuel&quot;.  If
&gt; he puts fuel in it himself it will run.  That's about all I know.  Can
&gt; anyone offer advice-the poor kid's spent all her $ on this bus and might
&gt; just throw in the towel.  Thanks much.

List, Mike:
This sounds possibly like the wire and wire AFM difference between 76
and 77?
The solution here is to get the ECU (Electronic Control Unit), harness,
and AFM (Air Flow Meter) all of the same year or range anyway.
Look in the archives for posts by Karl, he must have posted those
compatible numbers 10 times in the last 2 years! (Maybe this would be a
good project for someone to put into the library- or is it already
there?)
