Subject: Re: [T2] FUSES

&gt; I am hurt...ya didn't even put a little smiley face after the statement.
&gt;
&gt; You obviously haven't had the problems over the last 30 years with
&gt; corroded fuses holders that every time you want the windshield wipers
&gt; to work, you have to reach down and twist it a little so it makes good
&gt; contact.
&gt;
&gt; And I always clean mine with a wire brush dremel tool when restoring and
&gt; try to bend them a little so they make *good* contact.

Oh Ive done the twist. Many a time.
Ive dremel/wire brushed the whole fuse panel as well. Shiny mmmm.
As far as the smiley well.._dot_designer upholstery is no joke. :)
