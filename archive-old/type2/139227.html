Subject: Heater pipe replacement

Now that it's winter (or, what passes for winter in these parts, 
anyway), I find myself wanting to use the heat in my Bus a bit more.  
However, I still notice a fairly strong odor of &quot;burned oil&quot; when I do.

Since my engine is not dripping nor smoking, and my heat exchangers 
were boiled out this summer, I'm fairly certain that the odor is coming 
from accumulated oil-smoky-sticky goo in the accordion tubes and the 
large heat pipe that runs the length of the Bus, deposited there by the 
previously smoky heat exchangers, leaky oil cooler, etc.

The large paper pipe can easily enough be replaced by aluminum HVAC 
duct that can be had at the Home Depot, wrapped with some decent 
insulation (anyone have suggestions for material that would hold up 
best on the underside of a Bus?)

The accordion tubes should probably be removed and cleaned.  Are these 
fairly easy to remove from underneath?  Suggestions on a cleaner that 
can remove the goo without damaging the plastic?  Since they're 
corrugated, most of the cleaning action is going to have to come from a 
long soak and a thorough rinsing, I think.

What about other fittings?  There is a Y-fitting, and a return pipe 
that brings heat back to the rear heater vent on the floor, yes?

Anybody done this sort of work and care to share experiences?
