I'm going to describe the Vanagon controls, from my '80, I presume 
that the later ones are the same.

Top lever - Direction of hot air
Left=Floor
Right=Defrost

Middle lever - Amout of hot air
Left=No Heat from engine
Right=Heat from engine

Bottom lever - Fresh air from top black panel on front of bus
Left=No fresh (cold) air from dash vent to your face
Right=Fresh air from dash vent to your face

All to the Left=defrost, heat from engine, no fresh vent
For Heat to your feet= Top-left, middle-right, bottom-right

Too hot = move bottom two levers from right to left to let to reduce hot 
air from engine to feet and increase cold air to face.

I REALLY like to be able to get cold air to face to keep me awake, 
while at the same time keep my feet warm!

&gt;                       All to the right = defrost

CORRECT

&gt;                       Heat to the left=       cool
&gt;                       Heat to the right=      Hot
&gt; 
&gt;               I'm not sure about the rest (Don't make fun of me now...I've only been 
&gt; driving these babys for about 15 years)

&gt; '82, '84 GL Vanagons
