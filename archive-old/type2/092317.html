Subject: Electric VS mechanical fuel pump

Good day gentlemen's (and Ladies)

I have a simple question; I have a mechanical fuel pump on my 1700cc
(73'), as I said before I am preparing a long trip to Mexico and the
southern USA next February.
So I wonder about this pump being reliable, for sure I will try to buy a
spare one (I think Busdepot sells one?) I also have in my spare parts
what seem to be an electric metal fuel pump (wall mounted).

Question one:
Can I buy a rebuilt kit for the mechanical one or should I buy a spare
one or both.

Question two:
If I use the electric one (mine or the one sold by various parts
dealers), what is regulating the pressure of this one? (my Vanagon had
a fuel pressure regulator, do I have to add one if I use a electric
pump?)

Many thanks, Ben from Montreal, Canada
