Mount the spare as designed.

Then, get a full sized, cheap, plastic wheel cover, and pop it in the 
backside of the spare tire wheel. It fits fine.

This allows a nice space between the steel wheel backside and the $3.95 
plastic wheel cover to stash your wet swim suits, or smelly camp trash 
(until you get home, or stop at McDonalds).
