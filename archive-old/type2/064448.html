Subject: sound deadening

     I know we wove this thread a while back but has anyone tried any of 
     the various methods discussed for sound deadening since then and have 
     real world experience to share?  Is the pricey Roadkill worth it?  We 
     have the interior panels for the single cab but it is really noisy in 
     there.  When you shut the doors it darn near blows out the eardrums.
