Hey all,
Was rummaging in my &quot;inner sanctum&quot;, of my shop and found a few more
manuals, that I can't use.
One is a 75 Type 2 owners manual, in decent shape, no rips or tears, but
has a little stain on the back cover only.
$18.00, plus whatever it takes for postage.
The second is a 78 Campmobile supplement, nice shape, no rips, one
corner of the back page is gone ( about 1&quot; of the upper corner is gone.)
$18.00 plus whatever it takes for postage.
Third and last is a Range counter unit owners manual, with a parts list
on the back for 75 to 79 Westy,
It is a 2 page pamphlet, and in good shape,
$7.00 plus whatever it takes for postage.

Let me know if any of you might be interested.


Thanks Much,

            ______________
