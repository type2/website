Thom, Tobin and all;

There are some lovely little stoves designed for use in smallish cruising 
sailboats and the like.  Bulkhead mounted, insulated stacks (so as not to 
ignite a wooden boat), &quot;air tight&quot;, heating and cooking capabilities, and so 
on.  Very efficient, very compact, very pretty (lots of bronze and brass) and 
incredibly expensive.

One of these would serve nicely in a Type 2, but the price is prohibitive....
