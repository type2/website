Hi all,
I just thought I should end the saga of the Roadcow breakdown in Nebraska
last year. As you might recall I ran the old girl out of oil trying to make
time ( and not freeze) on my way back from Busrtoberfest and had to leave
Roadcow in Nebraska. I had many kind offers of towing and storage until I
could get back, THANK YOU all again!
Fast forward to this January when I had the bus home and a new Japanese
replacement engine installed and getting ready to take Roadcow to Busses By
The Bridge6. I just ran out of time and didn't get the bus started. So
today
I decided to go get the job done since I need it running to drive from
California to Everybus in North Carolina next week! I just went out and
confirmed that the dizzy was set right and cleaned the cap and rotor, put
some gas in the carb, turned the batteries on and Vrrrooom!!! Woo Hoo it
started, and ran fine. Now I need to make it idle below 2000 rpm and get
the
ignition tumbler switched out ( I lost the key Duh!!) make a trailer hitch
since I've volunteered to tow a 79 Westy to Kansas from Cali and a 66 Westy
back from NC to Kansas, so I guess the new name should be TOWCOW:^)
  My main reason for this post was to again thank everybody who offered
help
and who did get the call and responded with kindness. Anyone who wants to
caravan with me to Everybus feel free and give a shout. I hope to be there
Friday afternoon.
Britt
