No matter what distributor you've been running, the maximum advance of 52*
would cause serious problems.  You're very lucky the pistons haven't all
melted by now.

There is some difference of opinion about the max. advance that's acceptable
[it varies from 28 to 32 degrees], but most will agree a max. advance of 29*
is a safe and conservative setting.  And this applies to _any_ distributor
you might install.

If there's no obvious problem with your present vacuum advance distributor,
try setting it with a max. advance of 29* and see how it runs.  That should
give you an idle speed setting between 0* BTDC to 7.5* BTDC depending on
your engine and the model/type of vac. advance distributor you're using.

A good auto electric shop can check, analyze, and calibrate your distributor
using a distributor testing machine.  Overall, you'll be better off with the
stock distributor if it is repairable.

What year bus are we talking about?

&gt;&gt;  ...The only thing I didn't do was check the timing at
full advance, well luckily for me I have a friend that works at a local VW
shop and I took it down there for them to look it over before we leave for
the rainbow gathering(2000+ miles roundtrip) anyway he took a look at it
timing carb adjustment and at full advance it was at 52deg ?!?!?!?!?!? He
reccomended removing it and installing a .009 unstead. I was wondering once
I get it out and put the .009 in is there anything I can do to correct the
advance on the current one so I can use it as a reliable/functional spare?
