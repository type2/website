Subject: Re: [T2] SOLID LIFTER COMPATIBLE?

I thought that if you changed from solid lifters to hydraulic you also needed 
to change the camshaft.  I think the angle of the gring is different.

&gt; Hello gracious list,
&gt; 
&gt; I am wondering if a head from a 78 with solid lifters  - 2.0L ?
&gt; can be made to work with a 74-1800 engine.
&gt; can the lifters be swapped?
&gt; i have no experience with solid lifters.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks as always.
&gt; Darren
