Subject: No Penetration

I posed this question to Stiles, but I guess he's busy - no problem.

I have a Craftsman Professional wire-feed welder that is running flux-core
wire. No gas just wire.

I cut up an old steel bed frame to practice one, but am having one hell of a
time getting penetration through the steel!

So far, every weld I make just comes out looking like an over-glorified
soldering job, and they break since the metal has not been penetrated at
all.

Duroc suggested slowing down the wire speed - which I did, but then I have a
hard time maintaining an arc, and the results are the same.

Eventually, I have some spots of my Rivi that I want to weld panels into,
but I hear that heavier gauge steel is great for practicing on.

What am I doing wrong?
