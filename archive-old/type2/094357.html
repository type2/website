Subject: Re: [T2] bringing a vehicle from the US into Canada

I read this and realized I wasn't that clear. What I meant to say is that
one of two options will present itself almost immediately:

a) it will be a cinch to import because it is newish vehicle and the mfgr
built the same vehicle for both the US and Canada.

or

b) it may require expensive modifications in order to bring it into spec
with an equivalent Canadian version for that model year and this may cost
more than the value of the vehicle.  This is a possibility for a newish
vehicle and the likelihood increases as the vehicle gets older (e.g. age of
a bay window bus).

A friend at work unfortunately drove a Jetta down here from Canada and
discovered after he got here that the necessary upgrades required to meet
emission standards would cost more than the price of the same used us model
car here.

The main reason for this seems to be that the importing/modifying business
is based around importing gray market sports cars from other countries. The
conversion cost is minimal compared to the price of a sports car, but can
easily cost more than the price of a used car unless it's exotic or a rare
collectors item.

I wish the US had a site like this before I moved:
