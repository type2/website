I used the genuine VW articles when I did mine (or rather had someone do it
for me).  They fit very well but needed a piece removing at the top rear
corner - I suspect this has something to do with the new Brazilian vans.
The step area still only had 2 out of the 3 holes for the rubber though...
I decided to cut the mats so they would still fit with 2 holes - they were
in poor shape anyway.  One of them has since fallen off in the road
somewhere :-D  Some day I will get a nice new pair and drill out those extra
holes.

Jeff, when you are finished, make sure to pump a load of underseal in there
till it runs out the bottom.  That should stop it rusting out for another 20
years or so.
