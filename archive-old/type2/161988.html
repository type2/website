Sorry, no official name has been applied yet.  But you can vote if  
you like.  Check out the details at http://calivw78_dot_com/wordpress/? 
page_id=27 .  Its the weekend of the 18th in May (For those who don't  
want to click on a link.) No special events etc have been planned  
yet.  Is it legal to provide a breakfast  on Saturday morning without  
the FMBC in attendance?  In any case, I'm open to thoughts or ideas.

Peace, Troy
