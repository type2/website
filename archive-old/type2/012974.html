On the subject of making your own pop-top canvas, I have done it, and 
it's not too bad at all, especially if you can save your old canvas to 
use as a pattern. I cheated, and cut the new canvas out of an old tent, 
so I had windows, doors, etc already made up. I just cut to fit, and 
resewed it all together, and it's great! HUGE windows for ventilation, 
and already waterproofed! Pictures on my webpage, address below, or come 
see it at EVERYBUS this weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; Since the subject of canvas has come up...has anyone tried to cut/sew their 
&gt; own replacement canvas? My '77 needs new canvas, and I've been thinking about 
&gt; trying to make my own. I've found a local fabric store that will order the 
&gt; material, but my wife has just a plain 'ol Singer sewing machine that she 
&gt; says I will most likely burn up trying to sew it all together. The current 
&gt; canvas (which I believe to be original) isn't really that heavy of a 
&gt; material. If you look at it, it's really only 4 panels sewn together. The 
&gt; hardest part I see would be the front panel with the screen and the zippered 
&gt; flap. Just curious!  Hey, come to think of it, if I'm successful I may have a 
&gt; new business. I always heard Dawn had more than she could handle.      Jeff S.
