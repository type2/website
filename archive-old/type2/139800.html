&gt; How feasible is it to convert an automatic bus to a standard
&gt; transmission?

as others have mentioned it is a big job, and really not worth the hassle,
HOWEVER if you do decide to do it, I will buy the shift linkage  in it's
entirety from you, maybe other parts too. just contact me before removing
the auto shifter parts they are easy to mess up, I'll give you some tips,

but personally keep the auto tranny bus, or is the auto tranny what's
messed up?
