Subject: splitty in Pilbara, NW Aus.(Re: Cool!)

The 'Cool!' thread has reminded me of an old splitty I came across 
during a recent field trip with work into the Pilbara, North Western 
Australia.  Near the Comet mine just outside of Marble Bar there's a 
dump site of old mining junk, and amongst it was a split windscreen 
kombi.  I don't know much about splitties, but I'd guess it was about 
a '60-'65.  It was pretty run down, with a few of the side windows 
smashed, engine gone (gearbox still there though), paint faded with 
surface rust, decayed tyres hanging off the rims, dismal interior - 
looked to be used as a work vehicle.  But it appeared to be quite 
straight with no major dings or bumps and the rust appeared mainly 
surficial (although I didn't look at the underside).  

I couldn't help thinking that someone with the time and resources 
could probably bring this one back to life.....sigh.....
