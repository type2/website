Hi all,
    If you want cheap, I recommend going to the bone yard.  You could get
lucky and find yourself a beatle, bus or karman ghia that was a top runner,
well taken care of and still has the row of VDO gauges intact.  You might
even find a great engine underneath a smashed car that an insurance company
bought, then sold for salvage.  I found a 1600 DP for my second bug this
way, ran great by the way, but I also found a compliment of gauges in the
dash and the yard only charged 20 bucks for the set.  CHT, Oil Temp, Oil
Pressure, Ammeter, Clock, and Tach.  I also grabbed all the sensors that I
knew about (not many at the time).  Its cheap, maybe a little better than
using an oven thermometer.  BTW, when you add lengths of wire to a device
that utilizes current for the read out, doesn't that add resistance to the
system making the display read out incorrectly? YMMV

&gt; Jeff,
&gt;
&gt; i really like this idea.  i dont want to splice into any existing wiring &amp;
&gt; its also an economical solution.  but i have a few questions...
&gt;
&gt; 1) i would assume that this probe is taking the place of your dipstick. if
&gt; this is true then could you please elaborate on how it is secured in
&gt; place while driving?
&gt;
&gt; 2) any special tools or advice on how to straighten the probe w/o
&gt; damaging it?
&gt;
&gt; 3) anyone know if these are still avail. at radio shack?
&gt;

&gt; Here's an idea i followed and it worked...and its cheeeep.  For $20 or $30
&gt; you get a digital oven temperature thermometer (they used to sell them at
&gt; radio shack) with a probe...the probe is about 10&quot; long and curved and the
&gt; wiring is sheilded for about 3 feet with steel braiding...straighten the
&gt; probe.  Get the kind that at the other end of the probe is a mini plug and
&gt; this plugs into the digital readout...get an mini plug extension
wire...male
&gt; on one end and female on the other...run the wire in some plastic tuping
&gt; under the van to the readout on the dash...the whole thing runs on a aa
&gt; battery...the other end goes down the oil level stick tube and is corked
&gt; witha test tube stopper... the one I have also has an adjustable warning
&gt; beeper when it hits a temp. you have preset...they are durable,
independant
&gt; of the bus wiring, and cheap...and accurate...
&gt; &lt;end of quote&gt;
&gt;
&gt; mahalo in advance!
