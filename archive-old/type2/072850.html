The carbs are off the engine, so I haven't yet tested whether this works,
but I am simply using the double-relay (from the former fuel-injected VW
engine). I located the new (low-pressure) 911 fuel pump next to the old
(high-pressure) VW fuel pump and connected the original wires to the new
pump. In the engine compartment, I connected terminal 86b of the
double-relay to terminal D+ of the regulator. Hence the regulator takes
over from the AFC-box the function of signaling to the relay that the
engine is running.

If you only have the relay, but not the wiring, here's how the rest is
hooked up:
88z to the battery +
86c to terminal 15 of coil (ignition)
85  to ground/earth
88y to 88z
86d to fuel pump +
86a to starter's terminal 50

Of course, the purpose of all this is to have the fuel pump shut down when
the engine stalls, as in an accident.
