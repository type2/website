a quick question about cams

&gt; Hello All   Let me put in my 30 years of  VW workings here. You never mix 
&gt; match lifters and cams . even if you are doing a patch job you always put the 
&gt; lifter back in the same hole it came from. these things will wear a pattern 
&gt; that will only match the lobe it has been riding on. I have seen mixed match 
&gt; lifters wear all the way till nothing was left. As for solid verus hydlics 
&gt; solids give more power , more hassles also. hyldrlics work fine less power 

have a 78 pretty much stock and when rebuilt couple years back it got a
new hyd cam and put hyd lifter back in.  about a year ago a lifter failed,
don't know why but replaced it with a brand new lifter, new out of the
box.  is this lifter going to be a problem on the cam???
