Subject: Re: small generator 

Thanks!  The  generator joe link was perfect for what i was looking 
for.  every search i was doing all i could find was the 3kw and larger 
generators which would be as you said &quot;too big!&quot;  Lowes and Home depot 
and rv places all only stocked the big ones also.  The small honda and 
yamaha ones are exactly what i was looking for.  Just unfortunately out 
of budget range.

&gt; Personally, I think such a unit would be too large and heavy for me to 
&gt; carry on my camping trips, unless I towed a small trailer behind my 
&gt; Type 2. But, to each his own!
&gt;
&gt; I'd try some local sources first....Lowes or Home Depot if you have 
&gt; one. Then I would try the phone book locally, and look for suppliers to 
&gt; the building trades, as well as a recreational vehicle vendor (someone 
&gt; that sells and services travel trailers.) I'd also try a marine 
&gt; parts/service facility, if such exist locally.
&gt;
&gt; I'd also go on line and use my browser to find a search engine, such 
&gt; as  http://www.altavista_dot_com/  and type in &quot;electric generator&quot; in the 
&gt; search blank.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It would give me the following kind of information to extend my search:
