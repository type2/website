Subject: Re: [T2] engine/tranny drop: different CV Joint bolts

&gt; it's the outers on a vanagon use a drill bit big enough to  drill off the
&gt; head of the bolt only. You may need to turn the tire to  get a direct
&gt; shot at it. Make sure you get some new bolts.

Definitely get new bolts and the set of 12-pointers at AutoZone is a good
addition to the tool kit (there may be other 12-pointers in there - I have 'em
on my fuel pump and holding my fan onto it's pulley).

BTW, does anyone know where I can get a decent set of metric allen sockets?
I've got a cheap set but the allen 'tips' tend to pull out of the socket and
they are showing wear. My father has a nice set of solid allen sockets he
bought in Germany in the '70s - which I've been tempted to ask him for. I'd
rather buy a set of my own than leave him without... Although he did say he
hadn't had the sockets out of the box since '74 when he sold the Mercedes...

-Eric
