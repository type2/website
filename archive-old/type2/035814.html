&gt;&gt;&gt;As well, changing plugs on this sucker would appear to be worse than a 72
&gt;&gt;&gt;Type II with Type IV motor, the ones without the upper access hatch.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;the '72 plugs can be easily accessed as can any T4 front
&gt;&gt;plugs by grabbing yourself a short wobble extension bar, the Harbor Freight
&gt;&gt;set exceptional value for crappy Chinese tools that can really save you
grief.
&gt;&gt;I seldom if ever use the upper hatch actually even for those plugs, too hard
&gt;&gt;to lean over to get to.
&gt;
&gt;I concur.  I never use the access hatch to change my plugs.  I don't use a
&gt;wobble extension either.  And you know what?  It's an easy thing to do.
&gt;Why do so many people think it's difficult to change out spark plugs on a
&gt;'72??

I have no problems whatever with 72 spark plug maintenance access. But ask
someone who doesn't do maintenance as a vocation and many will offer they
hate the job, because of poor access. When the third owner DIY's get to
these VR-6 Euros, they will sorely wish they had a 72.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Oil was BLACK during specified service interval. 13 NDM
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Complete utter bull.  Oil should be black after a correct factory service
&gt;&gt;interval.
&gt;
&gt;Absolutely.  Mine is usually a VERY dark bown - nearly black by 3,000
&gt;miles.  Has always been that way.  On the occasions where I have let it go
&gt;a bit longer (but still less than 5k miles), it gets very black.

I will offer that black oil in a diesel is normal due to the high carbon
content of the fuel. It can only be inspected by feel. 

But in a gas motor, if you change the oil and 500 miles later the oil is
black, it is due to the fresh detergents dissolving the varnish that has
built up in the past due to inadequate change interval resulting in
overloading the detergents for more varnish buildup during the next
excessive interval.

In a clean motor of adequate lubrication service interval, the insides will
be as clean as the day it was assembled regardless the milage and the oil
will stay clean throughout its acceptable use interval. Compare the feel of
your black oil to the feel of fresh oil. If you can feel grittiness, so can
your bearings, rings, cam lobes, oil pump...... Do you accept that the feel
of the oil can provide empirical evidence?? Try it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But the DM lives on in the 4 decades of German production prior to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;90's. You know, the ones WE got, and with continued DM they will outlive
&gt;&gt;&gt;the compromises in current manufacture.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm... I would be hesitant to claim that any T1, T2, or T3 type II will
&gt;outlast a T4 if serviced properly.  There have just been too many advances
&gt;in engine design, lubrication, cooling, etc.

And added things to go wrong, like electric pop up push button Bozos. Can
you imagine the effort and cost involved in replacing all the non
functioning wizbang on a Eurovan when it gets to be 30 years old???
Electric windows and heated seats are Chic, till they go wrong and the cost
of restoring function is addressed. 

&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I can see a day several years from now when a VR-6 Eurovan comes in for
&gt;&gt;&gt;it's 100,000 mile spark plug replacement and two of six plugs bring the
&gt;&gt;&gt;threads out with them. Let's see, R&amp;R plugs every 100,000 miles, includes
&gt;&gt;&gt;R&amp;R heads, $2500 to do it right, maybe half that to jurusrigus. Then the
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A final note, the spec on the excessively expensive surface gap plugs on my
&gt;&gt;'91 G60 Corrado was of course also 90k.  Took them out and looked at them
&gt;&gt;at 30k, and replaced them at 60k for the hell of it but there was no
&gt;&gt;improvement
&gt;&gt;for doing so.

Except that the threads get inspected and maintained so the heads aren't
ruined. Any value there??

&gt;
&gt;I left a set of plugs in my Mustang (snip)

Cast iron is not aluminum.

&gt;
&gt;Unnecessary parts replacement is a tactic used by shady mechanics to pad
&gt;their wallets.  There is a fine line between this and replacing parts like
&gt;spark plug wires when there is nothing wrong with them except that they are
&gt;a few years old.

I agree. Parts should be monitored by inspection and replaced before they
fail. That's why I don't do tune ups. Tune ups are for vehicles that are
not maintained properly by inspection. How can you tell such vehicles?
First clue, the oil is black and it's not a diesel.
