Thanks for the information.

I've run Michelins on everything from high performance sports roadsters to 
humongous trucks since the mid-1950s, and have never had a separation or any 
other failure that was design or quality related.  I've had a couple of tires 
replaced under a road hazard warranty, but they failed because of being 
damaged by running over nasty sharp/jagged road debris.

If Michelin's quality control really has deteriorated I'm sorry to hear that.  
They pioneered radial tire design and manufacturing, and the company's success 
finally dragged the American tire manufacturers kicking and screaming into the 
radial tire market.  

For years the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; dispensed by the American tire companies 
was that radials had to be individually built by hand, thus the tires would be 
too inconsistent in quality and expensive to build to appeal to American 
vehicle manufactures and consumers.  They also claimed that a worn radial tire 
could not be recapped even though radials were routinely and very successfully 
recapped by many of their own dealers/distributors, often using locally 
remodeled or manufactured molds and equipment.

Frankly, the best tires I've ever run on a Campmobile were Semperit 185R14 
Reinforced.  If I could find another set I'd look no further, but at least in 
the Pacific Northwest Semperit tires haven't been available for over 10 years.

SEVERAL posts regarding their dangerous habit of coming apart at speed. &lt;&lt;
