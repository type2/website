[Crick, Bill ]  Regarding the lack of an index in the 
Bentley book, I remember another 
digest I was on where the subject's bible 
didn't have an index. Someone on the list
made one, distributed, and most people 
printed it, and taped it in. I think the author used this 
as his starting point for the index the next issue had
in it.

Pre-emptive FART defense: 
Can I heat my bus with the $40 12V electric heater I can get
from Blatso? 

ANSWER IS -&gt; NO! NO! NO! You can't get nearly enough power out
of your alternator to heat the bus. The alternator only produces 4 or 5
hundred
watts, much of which is already used to run the bus, and recharge the
battery after
cold weather starts. If you don't believe me, try to heat your bus up 
when it is parked using a pair of 100 watt light bulbs in extension cords.
Now extrapolate to the middle of winter on a COLD morning.

Have an day
