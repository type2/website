Subject: Re: [T2] No A/C on '71 Westy

I took the extension cord off the bus and hooked it
directly to the tv and no problems. If it has a
circuit breaker does is also have a fuse???

You might be right, but I don't recall GFI's in common
use in 1971. 
It may just be a resetable circuit breaker.  If it
were a GFI, it
should also have a test button.

&gt;Bryan,
&gt;
&gt;If you have a reset button on the outlet, that
usually means you 
&gt;have a
&gt;GFI outlet(Ground Fault Interruptor).  This is what
saves you when 
&gt;you
&gt;drop your hiar dryer in the tub with you.
&gt;
&gt;It could be bad(I've seen them go bad), but it is
probably busy 
&gt;saving you
&gt;from electrocuting yourself.
&gt;
&gt;Plug the tv in somwhere else and see if it works. 
Unplug the 
&gt;extension
&gt;cord and plug something simple in to the outlet and
see if it works.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, dave
&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt; I recently purchased a '71 Westy 2 weeks ago so
its
&gt;&gt; &gt; been sitting in my driveway while I get it road
&gt;&gt; ready.
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have the extension cord running to it so I
could
&gt;&gt; &gt; have my 9&quot; t.v. out there so I could watch the
news
&gt;&gt; &gt; while working on it. It's been working great
until
&gt;&gt; &gt; last night when I unplugged it to move it. I
plugged
&gt;&gt; &gt; it back in and had no juice. First I checked the
&gt;&gt; &gt; extension cord--it was plugged in and was giving
&gt;&gt; &gt; power.
&gt;&gt; &gt; I then hit the reset button on the outlet--it
&gt;&gt; clicked
&gt;&gt; &gt; but I am still not getting any power. Does
anybody
&gt;&gt; &gt; know what happened or what to check??
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
