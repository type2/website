Subject: fan /crankshaft torque question

hey list,

you might remember me as the guy who's fan fell off of his new rebuilt AVP
longblock and now has to replace his crankshaft. anyways, the question is,
what is the torque spec for the bolt that holds the fan hub onto the
crankshaft. it's a 13mm, i think. muir has a spec for a 30mm bolt of similar
description, but it's a 13mm. couldn't find it in bentley, although i don't
really know my way around that book yet.

i'm putting my old block back in the bus while i rebuild my rebuilt engine.
BTW, my mishap was not covered by AVP's warranty because my old-ass bolt
broke. they said if it breaks, it was overtorqued, and if it just falls out,
it was undertorqued.

TIA,
