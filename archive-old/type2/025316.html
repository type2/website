Hi Volks,

I'm prepping Das Uber-Kamper for an excursion, and decided that *this* was
the morning to replace the sliding windows on the 79 with the Jalousies from
the 78. 

I have them in place, and the grey seals appear to be correctly seated. But
there is still a huge ugly gap on the inside of the windowframes between the
jalousie's aluminum and the steel windowframes of the bus. Seems to be worst
along the bottom.

I wasn't present when the jalousies were removed from the 73, so I don't
know for sure if they forgot to remove a peice of trim or something. Sure
hope not, as the 73 went to the crusher a few weeks ago.

All suggestions and comments welcome, pmail them to me at
Greg-potts_at_home_dot_com, I'll update to the list(s) when I get this sorted.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
