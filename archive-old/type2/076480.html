&gt; This is a typical fuel injection problem that is repaired best by folowing

Well, I actually *think* I have it diagnosed. The ECU, AFM and Temp 2 all
got replaced as well as the cold start. Looking through the bill (and god,
i'm gonna kick someone tomorrow) the FUEL LINES AND FUEL FILTER were NOT
replaced. Logic kinda dictates that when you replace a gas tank because it
sat for 5 years you replace the lines and filter, doesn't it? Or maybe I'm
just being a meanie.

So, yeah, I'm like 99% sure that it's a fuel line issue since now that
I've driven it a bit more I've noticed it doing the hesitation/lurching
other than the times I've previously indicated.
