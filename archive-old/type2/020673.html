Subject: AH case in a 70 bus?

Hello-

I am currently assembling parts for a &quot;stock&quot; 1600 SP rebuild to
put in my 1970 bus. I have a lead on a good AH case. From
what I can tell, this is a type I case. Does anyone know if it
can accept the rear engine support bar? Does it have bosses
which can be drilled and tapped? Or would I have to use the
oil pump adapter thing (which I wouldn't :^)

thanks..
