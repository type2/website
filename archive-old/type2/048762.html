Hi Dan,

    Sorry, I must have typed that too fast or too early in the AM! Are my
fingers too fast, or is it my head is too slow? :-)

    The ULR should read    www.freeyellow_dot_com/members7/volksfix1/   I missed
the &quot;slash&quot; between the seven and the V.
    Thanks for calling me out on it. Have a good day!
