Subject: Re: [VB] carb Q

it is a Weber. I have the same carb on the '72. Origanally designed for the
Fjord Pinto it is a common afternarket carb for lotsa cars esecially buses
with type 4 motors. They can be fussy but mine does ok. There are lotsa
arguments on the list about how to deal with them in conjuction with 009s.
If you have a spare day check the archives.

You can get a Haynes manual for Webers and the 32/36 is covered. If you are
refering to run-on for a few seconds, that is a problem I have as well.
Instead of flooring as I shut it off or dragging the motor with the clutch I
always let the bus idle for 15 seconds or so after I pull in a parking space
before I shut it down. That seems to cure the problem which is caused by
among other things lack of an cutoff jet.

&gt;Hi y'all. The Dor Fires but doesn't stay running.  I suspected that'd
&gt;happen when I looked at the carb.  It's a funky 2 barrel of a type I'm
&gt;not familiar with, though my friends Derek and Ben say it's either a
&gt;Weber or Holley progressive.  No name plate visible, but on the front
&gt;where it meets the manifold there are these #s
&gt;32/36DFAV    234A 1E
&gt;
&gt;Anyone know who made it so I can get a kit?

&gt;I don't mind going nowhere as long as it's an interesting path.
