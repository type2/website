&gt;In my experience, those CVs don't come off when you
&gt;want them to.  Although heavy and bulky, I think
&gt;installing a half shaft on the road would be much more
&gt;do-able than trying to beat off a CV joint.  With my

Any cheap 2 arm puller will remove about any CV on the
road.  There is always one in my toolbox.  I do agree having
a spare halfshaft is easier, but in my auto tranny vans it would
have to be 2 spares, and by that time, one CV is a hell of a lot
easier.
