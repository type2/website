Yes, they are either dirty or not closing.
What did you set the gap at?
Did you set the gap with the rubbing block sitting on the high point of a
lobe?



&gt; i took the advice to put a test light on the sid of the coil that runs to
&gt; the distributor and turning over the engine.  The light never went off like
&gt; it was supposed to.  I didn't turn the engine over by hand i had a friend
&gt; turn the key.  so does this mean the points are bad?  thanks
