Howdy Volks!

This past weekend I, my mom, and my girlfriend
installed my new pop top canvas for my 73 Westy. Let
me tell you..what a pain in the butt! It was
definitley
a chore but well worth it. I started on it Friday
afternoon by taking the old canvas off..it took me
about 2 hours to get everything off and ready for the
Canvas to be installed..I figured that by having the
old removed already I'd save me a few hours on
Saturday. Well, the beginning of installing the canvas
went rather smoothly..stapleing the top on..I thought
&quot;wow, this is really easy&quot;..little did I know that
installing the bottom was the hard part. Getting the
screws back in their holes is pretty hard..And
mounting the corners is the most difficult..Well after
several hours of cursing, sweating, etc..I was ready
for the the pop up test...I began to pop it up and I
hear...riiiiiippp!! I'm like, NOOOOOOO! My canvas was
to tight on the right side and it ripped..no a bad rip
but seeing how it was brand new...I wanted it to be
perfect..Anyway, I had to remove staples, the
supports..again and loosen the canvas..I did this and
was ready for test two...it ripped a little more but
popped up..The rip was only in the bottom right corner
so I was'nt to upset..and the canvas was installed. It
looked so good too._dot_despite the few flaws and the
tear..All in all it took about 7 hours for me to
install mine but that was with breaks and all
included. You'll yell, swear, throw things..but it is
well worth it if you need new canvas...If I can do
it..anybody can!

Anybody know where I can get the table support for the
little table that is fastened to the ice box and sink.
The one that you flip out when your door is open. Mine
is now being supported by a hammer..it sure would be
nice to have the support for it..any around anywhere..

Thanks,

Greg
