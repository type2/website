Subject: Re: [BP] oil pressure warning light

Hey folks thanks for the info - I got that bad boy werkin'.  It still seems
odd that wires from the oil light and the gen light get powered from under
the dash where the bulb holder contacts with the speedometer housing while
the signal light and the high beam indicator ground under the dash where the
bulb holder contacts with the speedometer housing - but ... who am I too
judge.  Funny how once you know how things operate it seems obvious.

My current problem is .... where am I going to get some 12 volt accessories
to plug into that lil' outlet under my glove compartment.

and .... what was VW thinking when the designed the bay window bus without a
parcel tray - dumb - parcel trays are very handy.

and .... I wanna build a console to go between the seats.  I want it to hold
a cups and I want it to have a cushioned top much like the optional box
thingy.  I want to be able to open it an access tapes ... and maybe a place
for .... other stuff ... like garbage.

and .... I found a very nice CB radio at a garage sale today for $10.00.  I
don't know the brand but it is an early one in metal housing.  The owner
says it has an internal speaker.  All I need is an antenna.
