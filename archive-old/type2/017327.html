&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I am new to the list and this is my first post.  Recently my '78 Bus has
&gt; need some TLC, which I have tried to administer with my limited
&gt; mechanical knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; Recently I had a problem with the alternator light coming on and then
&gt; the engine immediately dying.  I could restart the engine and the
&gt; problem only occurred when I was slowing down and almost stopped.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried first replacing the alternator belt, which seemed to temporarily
&gt; alleviate the problem.  Next, I cleaned the battery terminals and cables
&gt; and that seemed to temporarily stop the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; This morning, however, the light came on and the engine died a few times
&gt; while I was driving in a residential neighborhood with lots of starts
&gt; and stops.
&gt; 
&gt; The battery seems to be charging okay and the car starts fine, so I am
&gt; not sure if it is an alternator problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; I much appreciate the help,
&gt; 
Sounds possible that the idle is set too low, the light will come on
when the rpm's drop too low.  This is FI, I assume?  Opening the idle
screw out a bit might help.  Another thing to look at carefully is the
points.  It sounds funny, but all the books say to begin troubleshooting
FI by looking very hard at the condition of the points and the timing. 
If in doubt, put in new points &amp; condenser and set the timing to the
book value.  Then adjust the idle speed.  Check back if that doesn't fix
it!   

HTH. . .  :&lt;)
