Speaking of cookers.....

A long time ago in another life I owned a Dormobile camper built on an
English Ford Thames van.  It was in a near terminal state of decay when it
came into my hands, so I removed the remnants of the interior and used it as
a utility van for a few years.

The Dormobile stove/sink installation was a marvel of design and
workmanship.  The cooker was a 3-burner heavy duty marine unit.  Lots of
brass fittings and cast iron grids and grill.  Two small propane tanks were
stored in a clever locker under the floor, stoutly built of wide steel
straps to allow ventilation.  A very marine-looking hatch sealed the floor
opening.  The cooker was surrounded by stainless steel heat shields, and the
adjacent wall and overhead were protected by aluminum heat shields.

The sink was a fiberglass unit with a marine &quot;trombone&quot; manual pump, brass
of course, and drew from a tank that could be removed and carried to a water
source for refilling.  The connection from the pump allowed it to draw from
most any container, like a jerry can, etc.

By current standards this was a &quot;primitive&quot; arrangement, but it marvelously
exemplified the KISS principle.

FWIW.....
