Subject: insulation

Well isn't that just the way it goes. I purchased some insulation
from JC Witney about 3 months ago. I have covered every possible
surface is my bus (except under headliner) with this and have been
quite happy. It really reduced road noise and helpes to retain
what little heat I have. 
So back to the first part of my message. Today I got a sale catalog from
JCW and they have my exact insulation on sale for 1/2 of what I paid!!:(
So I thought I might pass it along to the list.
They are offering it in 48&quot; X 72&quot; sheets. I purchased 3 of these for
about $70. Now they are JUST $12.47 each!! So here are the details.

Sale Book # 92JC

PLAA4  They will ask you to look at the back of the catalog at a small
        blue box and give them that code

Part # 25LY0705N

Phone # 1-312-431-6102 or 1-800-575-1888 ( I got this # from someone off
                                                the net. It takes them
                                                forever to answer it, if
                                                they do. But hey it's
                                                free)

If my blabling has got you confused please feel free to p-mail me
with specific questions.
