&gt;Does anyone have a Bus screensaver or wallpaper?

There is some guy (stevescollectibles_dot_com) on ebay who floods with at 
least 20 screensavers every week, incuding a bus screensaver which is 
full of images he &quot;liberated without permission&quot; (stole) from the 
internet.

I don't think I have seen him sell more than 3.  I would not buy one 
from him as a matter of principal.

&lt;sarcasm&gt;The &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Frank Sinatra&quot; screensavers he hawks 
         are very tempting though... &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
