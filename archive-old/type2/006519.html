Someone asked about professional rubbing compound?

First it will only remove rust stains that are on the surface of the paint
washed from a nearby rust spot,
or pore in the paint. It won't do anything for actual  rusty metal. There
you need sandpaper or a grinder.

 As far as professional or not, I've just used the stuff that Canadian Tire
(sort of a FLAPS)
sells. Of course I'm not a professional rubber. My wife says I'm pretty
good, but I've never been 
actually paid in cash for rubbing anything.
