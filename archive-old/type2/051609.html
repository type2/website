Subject: [T2] Fuel injectors and other bus stuff

Greetings, 
 Well, today I pulled the engine from my '76 westy. I bought this  
 bus almost two years ago. I was not running at the time, well the  
 engine would run but the clutch would not work. I found the clutch  
 problem, a broken clutch return spring. I have ordered a new spring. 
 My questions to the list. The engine in the bus is a GD case. I  
 remember when I started it before I bought it, it sounded like it had  
 marbles bouncing all around. Once I towed it home and started it again,  
 it sounded fine. Was the noise the hydraulic lifters pumping up? If  
 so, then I feel that it will make the noise again once I get the engine  
 back in. Is this a problem, and if so, what do I do? If it's not a  
 problem, will the noise go away? 
 I think that I should clean the injectors, what are your suggestions  
 on ways to do it? Do I need to replace the injector seals as a matter  
 of course? While I have this engine out, what all should I do to it? I  
 do plan to replace the FI hose. Where do you get the good FI hose? 
 Any other advice or suggestions you may have will sure be taken to  
 heart. 

 Thanks, 

 PS, I am so looking forward to have this westy on the road.
