Volks,

  Thanks for all the help, got my coil wires figured out and started it last 
night. It ran real rough and didnt turn over very well. Bought a timing light 
and dos pairs of rubber gloves set the timing and man does it run nice and 
sound gooood. I am amazed..

 Dont think I dont still have problems though, I know Ill find this but was 
wondering peoples thoughts. Drove it about 2 miles thru neighborhood, pulled 
in the drive and she was pouring oil out, passenger side front. Its hard to 
see where its comming from cause its so clear and new. It kinda looks like 
the push rod tubes but why isnt the otherside leaking. I made sure the tubes 
were super clean and the o rings were in there grooves and seated... I think 
its probably just my valve cover that  isnt on square.
 When should I change oil and first valve adjustment?  I assume now wouldnt 
be to soon...

  Thanks ,
