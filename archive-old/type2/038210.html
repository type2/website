Subject: Spark plug #4

The compression test was fine. Everything in line with one another. Am
in the process of checking all the spark plugs. I did buy new wires and
will put those on today.

The engine never ran bad. It just has this annoying little miss that I
hear. It occasionally will backfire slightly when I am slowing down
also. It's a relatively new engine ( only about 3000 miles, but it is a
GEX) I know, I know! But I didn't know when I bought it so now I'm stuck
with it til it dies.

I'm confident everything will turn out fine and I will happily be on my
way to Everybus come hell or high water. And judging from the weather
forecast it will be high water.
But what the hey no one ever melted from rain. (OK the wicked witch of
the east but she doesn't count)

See ya at Everybus!

Sharon
