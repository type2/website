Subject: 74 Bus Questions Update

Hi
I went back to look at the bus again today. I looked
close and I noticed that it was actually a 1600 from a
beetle using one of the rear mounting adaptors things
with the three holes that empie sells. The adaptor is
then attached to a moustache bar that looks like a
standard T4 moustache bar with something on top of it
that lines up with the adapter and it is bolted in
just like the engine on a 68-71. It looks like a
picture I saw of one that they used in europe on later
busses, I think that's what it is. Now with the beetle
engine in there I am not sure if the tranny in there
is stock or not. If it is stock, How difficult would
it be to put a 71 tranny in. I am going to swithch the
beetle engine out and put my extra 71 bus engine in
until I can find a good deal on a T4 engine. Still
have the electrical questions unanswered though.
What are some obvious things to check for the battery
draining?
Could the broken fridge have something to do with it?
Thanks
Tyler
