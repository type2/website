&gt;A list member in Texas wants to buy the middle seat from my 71 transporter.
&gt;He want's to put it into his 66 bus. I checked with UPS and their guideline
&gt;limit is 150 lbs with 130+ACI- for the overall package.  This seat would weigh
&gt;close to 100 lbs. +ACo-packaged+ACo- but would be about 170+ACI- overall.

&gt;Can anyone recommend a shipper to use from So Cal to the Houston, Texas
&gt;area?
==================&gt;
Well, you might check with the shipping dept of Solar Turbines.
They surely have big trucks going to Houston on frequent occasions.

The drivers would be independent contractors, or they would work for 
independent hauling companies.

It would probably be possible to have the seat loaded up and hauled as 
&quot;extra baggage&quot; on one of their regular run shipments.

I used to have this done when I was in business for myself. I used a 
shipper in the midwest that made regular runs to Houston. He would load up 
my stuff and charge me just a few extra dollars to get my stuff down to me. 
He made the run each week, and it was extra money for him, at no additional 
cost to himself.
