Subject: Re: [T2] removing rear brake drums

[...]

Somebody needs to fix this stupid program. Putting a [...] at the beginning does NOT stop my replies from
being kicked back. I have to put 3 or 4 in front to get a message thru. This is my last reply to ANY message
to the list.

[...]

 &gt;&gt; Bentley(ch. 8 p.24 sec 8.2)reccomends using a wheel puller. Any good tool rental place should have one.

&gt; I can't see how that puller works even after looking at the picture. It's
&gt; pulling on the studs by pushing on the hub in the center but the studs
&gt; &gt; aren't attached to the drum. Whuh?

 That puller will pull off the hub AND drum as a unit IF the big center nut is removed 1st.
 It will not remove a drum from the hub.
