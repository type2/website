Subject: Re: LP gas tanks under bus

Be advised that regulations require all LPG propane tanks to be certified every
12 years. The date of mfg is stamped on the container handle. A fill station is
not permitted to fill a tank that has expired and most won't. They check.

Don't trust the fill station or RV park to know anything about operation,
safety or certification. Most don't.

Locate the nearest LPG mfg distributor for tank certification which may require
replacing the valve parts.

If you need a mechanic to check out the RV related components of your camper go
to any RV park or campground and ask for a referral. Sometimes the local mobil
mechanics doing tank repairs, stoves and fridges etc will leave their business
cards at the counter.

&gt;
&gt; you can have the tanks checked professionally if you don't feel
&gt; comfortable doing it yourself, I am sure a camping trailer or motorhome
&gt; service facility would be able to do it or direct you to someone.
