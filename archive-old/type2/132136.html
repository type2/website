&gt;&gt; The bus will idle with the AFM disconnected.

Ok, this is odd. Greg's bus should not run with the afm plug disconnected,
or so I thought. How can it run with the fuel pump not running? The fuel
pump should not run with the afm disconnected.

So I did some tests on my 79 FI bus. I started it and looked at the fuel
pressure. 30 psi, within specs. Then I pulled the plug off the afm, with the
engine running. It stumbled threatened to quit, and then it KEPT RUNNING.
The fuel pressure gauge read 0, Zero, that is, and the engine kept running.
Ok, that is just fuel left in the lines, it will burn off and soon the
engine will quit. NOPE, it kept running.  I timed it and after over 10
minutes of idle it was still going. After about 12 minutes I shut it off.
The only thing I can think of is that there was enough fuel flow from
gravity into the fuel rail to make the engine idle. If you try to rev it, it
will immediately die, but it will idle a crappy kind of idle, seemingly for
all day.

Oh yes, and my air-fuel meter shows a very rich idle with the afm plug off,
no surprise there. It cleans up as soon as the plug is reconnected. And the
only way it would keep going is to have the idle screw way out.

So what did I learn? Not sure. There should definitely be 0 psi fuel
pressure with the afm disconnected, so if you have fuel pressure with it
off, the pump is still running and there is an electrical fault somewhere.
As for the engine idling with 0 psi fuel pressure, that was a big surprise.
