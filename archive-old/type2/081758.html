Subject: Re: [T2] Distance

I just got in the door from driving 527 miles today in my 74 Riviera. 12.25
hours including stops. This was the return leg of the trip which we did in
two stages on the outbound leg. No troubles whatsoever with the bus. (Yay!)

How many miles do you folks think you could average driving per day in your
Westy? Is it unreasonable to think that I could drive 500 miles for at least
a couple days in a row?
Thanks,
