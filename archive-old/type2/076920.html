Subject: [T2] Friday - VW Planet sighting


&gt; As I stumbled by the tv yesterday, access hollywood was on, and I saw a
&gt; picture of a computer screen enlarged to show the image of a certain
&gt; scandalous web site, and underneath, in the task bar, was a link to VW
&gt; Planet.  Belated thanks, Everett, for hooking me up with the 65 EZ Camper
I
&gt; bought in NY last June.  BTW Since its friday, what's the longest anyone
on
&gt; the list has owned their current bus(es)?  My wife has asked me what would
&gt; make me sell either of mine, and I couldn't come up with an answer right
&gt; now.
