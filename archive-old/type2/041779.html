Subject: Re: L-Jetronic Tuning Question

Yeah, I don't see myself doing too much too that engine anytime soon
unless some serious $$$ comes my way, but I'd like to bring it
reasonably back into spec.  The problem is that I don't have a reference
to set the AFM spring tension because mine was messed with both by the
previous owner and myself.  Right now, I'm just kinda guessing the
settings and I don't know if the changes I've made are good or bad,
especially cuz it's running a little rough now.  So if you have any
specifics on how to set that spring, send 'em my way!

Thanks,
mike

&gt; Mike, you gotta realize that you're asking 67 air-cooled hp to move a 3500lb+
&gt; vehicle. Kinda pushes the Laws of Physics to the breaking point! If you
&gt; manage to pass the 20mpg threshold, you're just golden. I get 24mpg hiway(
&gt; much modified ' 78 Westy Delux), and that's with a fresh eng, CDI ign.
&gt; (w/Pertronix ignitor) Bosch plat. 4 tip plugs and some very expensive eng.
&gt; work. (counter weighted crank, zero ballanced, 8.2-1 comp. ratio, tweaked
&gt; heads, and a lot of trial and error FI experimentation. BTW, I've found that
&gt; 97hp/ 139ftlbs tourque is all you can safely build a stock displacement 2.0L
&gt; eng. to. And I've spent a butt load of money finding that out...How many
&gt; eng.'s now? 3, no 5...) Anyway don't sweat the mpg too muck. Just remember
&gt; what you're asking you're eng. to do!
