&gt;I own a 72 campmobile(1800cc, dual 34's) that has been spectacular.  I do 
&gt;most of my own work but draw the line at carbeurators.  I took Buelah to my 
&gt;somewhat trusted mechanic who told me that they couldn't be adjusted any 
&gt;better.  He said that the connection between the carbs and linkage was worn 
&gt;and there was nothing to do but replace them.  I'm sure somebody out there 
&gt;has heard of this.

My linkage is somewhat worn, but the real problem is the throttle plates
which wear quickly and usually require rebushing.  Despite this my bus runs
really well (I think).  Is your bus not running well?  If not I bet you
have other problems besides a worn linkage.

One thing to note - where the crossbar attaches to the bracket on the right
carb - there is a hole in the end of the crossbar inside which should be a
spring and a small cylindrical plastic piece with an indentation to match
the ball on the bracket.  For a long time I didn't know this plastic piece
existed and that joint was very loose.  Believe it or not I was able to get
a new plastic piece at the VW dealer and now the linkage is rock solid.  If
you remove the crossbar the plastic piece tends to fall out and get lost -
my gut feeling is that yours is missing.  If so, get to the dealer and
order one.  If they can't get it, let me know and I'll get you one from my
dealer (who seems to be better than most about getting old bus parts).

Now that I think about it, the '72 has a different, one-year-only linkage
and I'm not positive it has the plastic piece like the '73-74.  It might
though, so have a looksee.  I'm going to post this anyway in case it will
help 73-74 owners.

&gt;If I do indeed need new carbs, my gut feeling is to go with dual webers.  I 
&gt;could sure use some advice.

I like the stock carbs, but they can be very finicky and I don't blame
other people for wanting to swap something else in.  I'm pleased that you
are at least considering aftermarket duals instead of the single Weber that
everyone else seems to put on that engine.
