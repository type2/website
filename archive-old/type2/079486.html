&gt; The72 (in USA, anyway, with type 4 engine) had a longer input shaft. You could

Nuh uh.  This stayed the same up through the late 75 change.  The
bellhousing and input shaft on a 72 WILL work fine, assuming it is
original..

As I recall, the front mount changed, though, so the nose may have to
switch.

The top mount shouldnt cause any problems, since it will just hang in dead
air...it IS possible that it will hit something, but I dont know that for
a fact.

Hooper, have you put that 75 in your 68 YET? :)

...david (ran a 40hp on the same early 75 tranny, fit fine...later gave
the tranny to ken for his bus.)
