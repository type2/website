&gt; You already know about brake booster assist, but i wanted to advised that
&gt; maybe, since this booster line isn't hooked up, there is something that it is
&gt; not hooked up to, and that is a vac port somewhere in the intake system.  If
&gt; you're running a single Weber, there oughtta be a big 0.5&quot; port on the
&gt; manifold.  I don't know where it hooks for duals or FI, but if the vac port

on the FI it is on the left side of the Throttle body just in front of the
distributor.              -------

&gt; for the brake booster is not hooked up to the booster or plugged, you have a
&gt; vacuum leak and you're running leaner and hotter than you should - potentially
&gt; dangerous for your engine - specifically the heads.

important point.
