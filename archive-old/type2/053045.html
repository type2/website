Subject: Fuel pressure Guage

Hi guys,
Has anyone installed a fuel pressure guage in a FI bus.
I was looking at capillary tube type(non electrical) oil pressure guages the
other day wondering if one of them could be used.Being able to view fuel
pressure from the drivers seat seems like a good idea.
Jeff
