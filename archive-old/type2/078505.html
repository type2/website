&gt; &gt; I follow you except for the vise grips backwards part. can you 
&gt; explain please?

I misspoke.  I should have said &quot;a small pair of _channelocks_&quot;, not 
vise-grips.  You insert the head of the channelocks into the hole in 
the middle of the piston and push the handles apart, which grips the 
piston from within.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm thinking about rebuilding the calipers on my 71 bus, but the 
&gt; &gt; Bentley manual makes it seem fairly complicated.  Is this something 
&gt; &gt; that can be easily done without all the special tools, or am I 
better 
&gt; &gt; off just purchasing remanufactured ones?  I have decent mechanical 
&gt; &gt; skills, if that makes a difference.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've done it and it isn't particularly difficult.  _Don't_ separate 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; caliper halves from each other!  You don't have to do this to 
rebuild 
&gt; &gt; and if you leave the seals undisturbed you won't have to replace 
them.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I used a small pair of vise-grips &quot;backwards&quot; to grip the piston 
from 
&gt; &gt; the inside.  I made a tool from PVC pipe to use with a C-clamp to 
&gt; seat 
&gt; &gt; the dust seals.  Other than the dust seals being a bit hard to 
seat, 
&gt; it 
&gt; &gt; was not difficult.  Be sure to replace the brake hoses at the same 
&gt; time!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; After you get the pistons out, inspect the cylinders.  If you find 
&gt; &gt; corrosion pitting, it's time for new calipers, so don't waste your 
&gt; &gt; effort in putting in new seals just to have them leak.
