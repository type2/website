Hey Dean,

I checked out the photos and it looks like you got a nice bus for only
$1,200.  I looked at a 79 Westy in Fort Smith last year and thought it might
be the one you bought, but it wasn't.  In addition to Bentley and Muir I
would suggest you also get a Haynes manual.  I got mine at Autozone.
They're not as good as Bentley, but they are relatively cheap (about $15)
and provide another reference with photos and perhaps a different
perspective.  I'm in Springfield, MO and I understand they have a good VW
club in Fort Smith.  That should be a good source of help and advice.  If
you can't find the info on the club let me know and I will find it for you.
A good VW salvage yard also exists about 2-3 hours NE of you in Kingston,
AR.  The name is Way Out Salvage and he has a website at wayoutsalvage_dot_com
which you could also check out.  As of about two years ago, there was also a
guy at Conley Motors in Muskogee, OK that had lots and lots of VW parts and
salvage busses.  The last I saw him he was planning on going out of
business, but he had lots of stuff.  He is right on HWY 69 north of town.
In the region you can't beat the Northwest Arkansas VW Association show in
Eureka Springs, AR every August.  Hundreds of VWs and lots of parts. Good
luck with the bus.  As for advice it would be far too lengthy here, but
engine removal isn't that bad.  I would encourage you to get some help the
first time you do it.  Afterwards you can do it by yourself with a good
floor jack and a little patience.  Good luck.

Randall and Kermit (The lean, green, mean machine)

Hi, I've been lurking for 6 mos. saving snippets of the digests for future 
reference and am now ready to start restoring the VW that I've bought.  Am a

resident of Poteau, OK (SE part near Fort Smith, Ark.)&amp; am a VW newbie but 
lifelong admirer that has always wanted a VW Camper.  I bought a '79 
Westfalia Deluxe that has been driven since '94 back in July for $1200.  
Previous owner said it needed a new transaxle (wouldn't go into 2nd gear) 
and engine was fine (last rebuilt in early 90's).  Van was has had two 
owners and was used extensively in the Sierra's.

I had to complete other projects before I could work on the van and they are

now done so it's van time.  I cleaned out the rear garage, pushed the van 
in, read chapters 1-4, 7 of Muir, obtained a Bentley, got my stool out and 
looked at the engine and nothing made sense in regard to the engine removal 
instructions.  My ziploc baggies and Sharpie pen are still waiting to be 
used.  I thought I was somewhat smart and could figure some things out, but 
I want to do it right.  Have a patient that has owned some buses and is a 
mechanic to boot so may hire him for a couple of Saturdays with me being the

sweat equity.  I even thought I would extensively photograph the engine with

my digital camera &amp; used the photos to put the thing back to together like 
it was.

I will be posting at times to ask for direction but will promise to check 
archives before doing so.  I have enjoyed reading the digests and look 
forward to the day I can drive this yet unnamed (waiting for it to tell me) 
Westie to a gathering.  All advice and offers of assistance appreciated.

Photos of my van can be seen at www_dot_cartogra_dot_com.  My member name is
