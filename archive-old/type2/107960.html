Subject: [T2] AFM Replacement

&gt; I've been coping with minor, intermittent stumbling and poor idle (Temp
&gt; Sensor II checks out OK). This only occurs when the engine is hot and left
&gt; to sit for 15-20 minutes and then restarted. Since it always stumbles at
the
&gt; same point in the shift range, I'm suspecting the AFM. I know mine is old
&gt; and it has obviously been disassembled by a PO. Two questions...
&gt;
&gt; If a marginal AFM sits in a hot engine compartment for a while after
&gt; shutdown, might the heat aggravate it enough to cause these problems to
&gt; occur on startup?

Are you saying that if you engine is completely warmed up it idles OK and
has no stumbling?  It only happens after the 15-20 shutdown then restart?
Offhand, I can't think how this would occur, thinking only of the AFM.  I
understand injectors can be subject to &quot;heat soak&quot; issues after a shutdown
because the temperatures there tends to climb quite a bit when the engine is
turned off.  Maybe this has something to do with it?

If you're thinking that simple wear on the resistive track is somehow the
cause of your problem then you have nothing to lose by opening up the AFM,
removing the board the strip rides on and slightly elongating the screw
holes in the board with a small file.  That'll allow you to reposition the
board slightly so the portion of the resistive strip being tracked is
&quot;fresh.&quot;
