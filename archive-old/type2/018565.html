           I have to wonder what's wrong with the archives -- we just
discussed this at length not too long ago, and then even earlier about a
year ago or so.
          Anyway, if you look at the dizzy chart in Bentleys, you'll see
that the total advance of dizzys is about 25 BTDC for the centrifugal
part, and another 11 BTDC for the vacuum. That gives 36BTDC plus your
inittial 7.5 degrees for a total of 43.5BTDC.
           That's why you shouldn't use a 009 on a T4 engine (not to
mention that you don't need the #3 cylinder retartd it has built in)
because you can't get enough total advance without setting the initial
at about 20BTDC which makes it hard to start. About the best you can do
is set it to 12-15BTDC static. Even the 050 which is better (no #3
retartd, a tiny bit more total advance) does not belong on T4 engines.
