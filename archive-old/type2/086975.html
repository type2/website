&gt; All this talk about unrestored buses is hitting home.  I have a '71 Westy
&gt; with an honest 59K on it.  The body is badly rusted along the rockers and

well I have a $2 special with a minimum 308K on it and if there isn't a
problem it hasn't had in the eight years I've owned it, they are on the
agenda.

&gt; My point is that it pains me to have it sit there.  I'm a year behind on a
&gt; house restoration job, and I just can't pay any attention to it.  It's not

been there, doing that too!  but the bus is great for hauling lumber,
cinder block etc, etc etc.

&gt; even registered at the moment.  The new house has a nasty little one car
&gt; garage, and the second car is going to sit off to the side on the driveway

which means you are up a driveway and garage on me, I live in the city and
don't even have a driveway.

&gt; Maybe it's time to just say goodbye, and get another when I have room.  It
&gt; cheers me up just sitting in it, and as my daughter once said, you just
&gt; can't be angry when you're driving the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't be the only listee who's had to face this one, and it's Friday.  It
&gt; isn't the money, it's the space.  What do you say:  I don't want to store it
&gt; way out elsewhere, but I feel stuck and the clock is ticking.  Thoughts?

get it tagged and start driving it.
