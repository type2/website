Subject: wheelbearings\73 bus.

Dear aircooled friends,
  Sure hope I'm back in the right place now...I had unsubscribed for the
summer and when i got back the list had been split into water- and airheads.
So this is the aircooled half of the former vanagon_at_lenti...thing, right?
  To the mechanics: I', gonna clean and repack the front wheelbearings on my
73 bus this weekend, and I was wondering if you suggest any particularl;y
good grease for that. The manual just says &quot;Lithium grease&quot;, but doesn't
specify any particular viscosity or additives. Is &quot;multipurpose Li grease&quot;
okay to use? Opinions??
  Good to be back!
Ciao,
            Gregor
