After breaking the accelerator cable just south of DC on friday afternoon 
(Hey, with some hemostats and wire ties, I can fix anything) we limped to 
north Jersey with fingers crossed.  I got on the phone Saturday morning and 
after about 20 calls found a cable at German auto  (the closest dealer's 
computer showed he had never stocked one, ever!) in Manville.  Tiny shop, 
been on the same corner for 20 some years, looked like they had a fair amount 
of NOS stuff tucked everywhere.  No affiliation, just a really nice find, a 
mom and pop kind of shop hanging on to that sense of community so many seem 
to lack these days. yeah, that's a jab.
