&gt; Quoth Steve Dolan:  If you get 17&quot; of vacuum at idle with the
&gt; &gt; distributor properly set, then be happy.
&gt;   In my 71 Westy, I placed a permanent vacuum gauge in the clock hole,
&gt; with a stiff tube (nylon) running all the way back to the carb.  As I
&gt; recall, 17&quot; was the norm!   I made a game of driving effiecently, since
&gt; every step on the acc. pedal showed up on the gauge!  Where do you hook
&gt; this up to in a 78 FI engine??

Michael, and everyone else...

The FI engines have the perfect vacuum port built in...  between the
intake runners for cylinders 1 &amp; 2 on the intake air  distribution box
there is a port for the fule pressure regulator.  Each of my buses has a
&quot;T&quot; cut in there for convenience.  I *ought* to have the vac gauge in the
pod up front, but I figure I am enough of a hazard with my curent lack of
HP... if I started driving to the vacuum gauge, I'd *never* get across the
US :-)
