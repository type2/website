Thanks for the replies (I know the circular-saw things you mean, but I was
worried that they might not work 
well on sheetmetal)  - being a 1970, most of the dash has no padding.

BUT...

A colleague has told me of a tool consisting of two halves which are fitted
to front and back of the metal via a pilot hole, and then a blade of some
kind which is turned by an allen key to cut the hole.  It's intended for
just such a job as this.   
Anyone know what thy're called, or where to find one ???

Also, I'm thinking of buying a Stainless Exhaust from Volksbits (in the UK)
any one know if they're any good ?
