Subject: re: sucked a valve?

I think I would have to go with Al's advice on this...
based on your description.... I once had my bus start
blowing smoke (or so it seemed) turned out to be a
broken ground wire in the dizzy... so it was making
poor/intermittent contact ( I guess)... dont know why
that would cause it to emit smoke from the exhaust...
unburnt fuel vapor?// anyway check the other stuff 
first!

&lt;snip&gt;
I'd go through the trouble shooting stuff for the
ignition and fuel
systems and then check the compression again before
EVER taking  the
engine apart.
