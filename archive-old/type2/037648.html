Subject: camper latch

hello all, new to the list here.

i just bought my first vw last weekend.  i got a '77
westy.  there is a lot of work to be done.  right now
i need to find a latch that releases the camper top to
open.  in all of the catalogs that i have been given i
only see the rubber straps for the older models. 
please let me know if anyone has one or where i can
find one.
