Subject: engine in......wish me luck

hey volks,
happy friday.    well just an update to my progress.  
my parts arrived from bus depot this week, sans new
catalog....damn!   but im sure ill get one sometime.  
anyways, all parts installed and my friend and i put
the engine in yesterday evening, wow was it easy,
engine slid into place and was bolted up in like 20
minutes.   tonight ill finish putting everything else
back on and try to remember where all those wires go. 
 so tonight or tomorrow will be initial starting!  
hopefully i can report back to the list with great
news, and not a maniacal rant:)   have a great weekend
all!
