Subject: Re: [T2] I think it's seized

I should have clarified in my last email that I was  talking about the 
engine I've been trying to test.  It has been sitting for a while.
After spraying some liquid wrench in the valves and pushrods I got them to 
operate ( at least the ones that are supposed to be with the position the 
engine is in.

I pulled the plugs and put marvel mystery oil in the holes. I can now get 
the flywheel to shimmy back and forth a very little, which is better than 
nothing at all, which is what was happening.

I'm going to let it settle for a day or two and just keep trying.

The alternator wouldn't spin before and I sprayed it and now it does.

If anyone has any other suggestions I'd love to hear them.

I wouldn't have gotten this far without all your help.

Thanks,
Kyle
