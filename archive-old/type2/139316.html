&gt; Duh.  Bulbs went down bravely, saving a 10 cent fuse.  Ha!

I seriously doubt all of the bulbs burned out at the same time. Probably
none of them did. Burning out a bulb requires an over-voltage situation or
old age. Shorting hot to ground would make a big spark with the tool making
the short -- but your voltage is going there, not through the bulbs. When
you remove the short te volts go through the bulbs again but it's not very
likely all of them would die.

If you managed to short the middle of the instrument dimmer resistor to
ground you may have toasted THAT though.

I'd check for voltage at the lights before replacing any of them

But, anyway, always good to have a few on hand:

Note the price is per PAIR. Probably peg carded and shrinkwrapped.
