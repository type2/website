Subject: Re: [T2] CR on DP to SP conversion

WE have every engine we build dynamically balanced, it is worth thbe extra
$$$ for a smooth engine, that last longer..

&gt; I argue with the doc as much as anyone, but I had this done to my 2liter
&gt; when it was rebuilt and I can vouch for his observation,  however it is a
&gt; diminishing returns sort of thing, the closer the balance the more it
&gt; costs, I think VW allowed 9 grams out before a rebuild and 4-5 grams at
&gt; rebuild...I found that a good compromise from perfectly on$$$$ and way off
&gt; was at 1gram, so I had my pieces and entire assembly balanced at
&gt; 1gram..(didn't do the flywheel because I don't have one (auto
&gt; tranny) added about $100 to the cost of the job

&gt; &gt; &gt;I am set to go on building the new engine.  I should get the case back
&gt; &gt; &gt;Friday, and upon inspection the machinist said it looked to be in very
good
&gt; &gt; &gt;condition.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyway, with NEW jugs and heads, do I have to measure the CR? Seems
like an
&gt; &gt; &gt;extra job that I could do without right now. (Novice here)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What, you mean you will tear it down and do it later??? Should always be
&gt; &gt; verified. Deck heights should be matched. Combustion chambers should be
&gt; &gt; matched for volume. Good money spent to have your machinist do this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I have a gram scale to check the rods. Should I check the new pistons
as
&gt; &gt; &gt;well?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Most certainly. Also, the rods should be balanced end to end and total
&gt; &gt; weight. I would also spent the money for the machinist to do this. Also,
&gt; &gt; the crank and flywheel should be independantly balanced, then bolted
&gt; &gt; together and finish balanced as a unit. If all this is done right, that
&gt; &gt; motor will idle and run so smooth it will put a smile on your face every
&gt; &gt; time you fire it up for the next 100k, assuming maintenance by
inspection.
&gt; &gt; And balance as well the valve springs, meaning their pressures at both
&gt; &gt; installed height and at lift height.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Balance = harmony = efficientcy = longevity = best cost per mile,
&gt; &gt; regardless the cost, which is value. Leave all this out and what you
have
&gt; &gt; is GEX. It will cost only some 10% more in time/money to have a balanced
&gt; &gt; assembly. This is pays off bigtime in results.
