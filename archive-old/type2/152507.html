Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for brake caliper

Jon,
I wish to say that IMHO drilling the rotors won't make my bus brake any
better for the daily usage. I think it is irrelevant for bus driving as well
as any kind of non-racing driving.

The reason being that the brakes on my bus never get any close to fading. In
daily driving the bakes are used only punctually, not right before the turns
on a track.  Concerning downhill driving: I would rather rely on engine
braking (by selecting appropriate gear and initial speed) than groving the
rotors when it comes to driving a load safely down the mountain.

Drilling the rotor helps the cooling of the brake
rotor//piston/caliper/fluid. But is does not help the braking force
available in normal driving conditions.

Drilling the rotors costs money and reduces the life span of the rotors.
