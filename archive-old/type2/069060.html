Rodney,

I am quite sure the use of tri-square fasteners was based on sound,
engineering practice.  But that is not the same as saying that of all
available fasteners it is the best possible fastener for the job.

Modern-day automobile manufacturing is more a reflection of the accountants
in the board room than the engineers in the lab.
