&gt; When was the last time  you heard of a garbage truck being stolen?!?!
&gt; Who's heard of a beater bus being stolen?
&gt;
&gt;
Actually, a garbage truck WAS stolen in NYC a couple of months ago...
The thief just jumped in while the guys were loading it and drove it a-
round a few blocks causing quite a bit of damage to everything in its
path 'til he jammed it amongst some parked cars... ;-(
