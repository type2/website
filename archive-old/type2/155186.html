Subject: Papa Joe

I just want to say this man is one of the finest I've met in awhile.  My
daughter and I pulled up to his place north of Atlanta today and
discovered we shouldn't even have made it there.  The accelerator cable
had broken and been clamped back together, the output shaft from the
transmission fell out when we pulled engine and tranny apart, and during
this first freeway drive we were blowing enough oil to spatter the rear
window.  When it appeared all these issues weren't going to be resolved
today, he drove us home.

Anyway, thanks to all on the list, and especially to Joe Stewart, about
whom enough just can't be said.

David Bradley
