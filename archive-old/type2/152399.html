Subject: Re: [T2] Fair price for instrument panel?

Well, I suppose. I think this sort of thing is just strange. What's $15 
to somebody who just put porsche gauges in their bus? Why don't they 
just give the thing away for shipping?

A working panel is worth $100. John's $75 is a bargain. Free gets rid 
of it fast. Fifteen bucks is weird.
