Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

The weatherstrip adhesive is OK--but after a short period of time gets
hard and brittle and will leak--
The beauty of the Pematex Hightack--is that it stays pliable and won't
get as hard as the contact cement--which the weatherstrip adhesive
actually is--

Later,

Terry

You are absolutely right about this, Dave. People put rtv on the
cylinder bases, for instance. If you are not careful, a glob gets into
the cylinder bore, into the sump, then lodges in an oil gallery
somewhere and toasts the engine. It happens.
If you want to glue the gaskets onto the head covers, which is a fine
thing to do, use 3m weatherstrip adhesive, very sparingly.
