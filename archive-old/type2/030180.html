Well, the 400 miles from SoCal to Carson City NV wasn't without incident!

Left home about 2:00 (had to give my students their finals!) and hit CA14
north.  It was relatively warm from Palmdale to Bishop, but bus ran just
fine.  South of Independence I happened upon a fellow pushing a black ghia
'vert along the shoulder.  Seems he had overheated and it wouldn't
restart.  I fiddled with it a bit, burnt my hand on the generator pulley
while trying for compression, and finally got the thing started.  We
putted up the road a couple of miles to the next rest area (this was the
middle of nowhere!) and the fellow decided to wait until evening to
proceed.  I gave him the name of a shop in Bishop and wished him good
luck.  He gave me an orange.  Hope he made it OK.  Moral: engine seals
_are_ important.

Further up the road I came across someone who had turned their pretty red
car into modern art by rolling it into the center median.  The Highway
patrol had matters well in hand, so I kept going.  Moral: pay attention!

Toward the evening the weather cooled off nicely, so I continued up US
395.  I arrived in Carson City about 10:30PM.  Upon arrival, I had a
generator problem that I'll detail in the next posting.

Today my Dad and I are off to Eureka NV to work on the Pony Express
reenactment.  We'll be back in Carson (and computer access) in a couple of
days.
