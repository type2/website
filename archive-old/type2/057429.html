Dear Bob Hoover-
Although it is easy to understand how you feel and why you feel it... and
it is even easier to understand that your wisdom, time, and wonderful
writings have been a labor of love rather than a profit-seeking endeavor...
I will still defy the logic, and ask you, as countless other listmembers
have... to please reconsider.... and return to us your knowledge, wit,
wisdom, humor and life experience so that we may benefit from all of the
above mentioned.    

Why?   Because we (the list) have become spoiled in having all of this
information and wisdom bestowed upon us, and as many previous writers have
suggested, we are all, or almost all willing to pay you for your work...
although...it is my opinion that monetary compensation was never your
motive, and why would that change now?   I just wanted to add my voice to
the others, in trying to convince you to reconsider on any level, whether
it be the reinstatement of your web pages, or the availability of a CD or
paper book containing the sermons.       Although I enjoyed and admired the
technical stuff that you wrote and found it very practically valueable, I
prefered to read your free flowing prose about road trips and the rincon
rocket and the like.  You have become a modern day bus folk hero to many of
us, and whether or not you decide to return this information to us in any
capicity, whether for pay or for free, I would like to let you know that I
enjoyed all of your work immensly and for what it's worth.. I wanted you to
know that you have touched the heart and soul of at least one person and at
the most, thousands of people.

Thank you Bob Hoover for what you have contributed to my life and to the
lives of other bus lovers.   I respect you and your descision whatever it
may be.

Long live the forever bus.  Long live Bob Hoover.

Anyone who thinks this is on the corny side...  yep.. you're probably
right... but I really don't care... it's a message from the heart.
