&gt; Is your son's Dormobile the green one? If so, I saw it and lusted after
&gt; it. ;-) He did a great job on it.
&gt;
&gt; I agree, not too many loafs there. I was a tad disappointed.


Bren--

Yes, the Green Dormy.  Thanks for noticing.  But I don't want you to get the
wrong impression and think that my son, Aaron,  restored it.

The story is that he, at 16, was fortunate to have some money to buy a car
to learn to drive in.  I thought a  simple Toyota or Honda.  But he said,
&quot;Dad, I would really like an old VW bus.&quot;  At first I wasn't sure, but I
thought at least he has good taste.  Then I thought that with a  bus he
would &quot;really&quot;  have to learn to drive.  My older son learned on an
automatic and I feel that he is the less for it.  The bus is definitely not
a &quot;point and shoot&quot; car.  He knew that it would take him longer to master it
and get his licence.

We found the bus in Lompoc via the T2 for sale list, nicely restored.
Reliable enough that it is not a constant project and a bargain at $5000,  I
think.  He is learning to drive it well and to take care of it,  though we
do rely on a mechanic .  I was proud that he drove the whole day Sunday,
including home to Berkeley on the freeway in the wind.  He had fun at the
show too.  It is not often that this16 year old boy and his father can enjoy
a full day together.

I am not anxious for the day that he moves past his learner's permit and
gets a full license, because I am having so much fun driving it on a daily
basis, and I fear that when he can drive it without me I will rarely see him
or the bus again.

Still I wonder, do late bus owners in the SF Bay Area get together?
Apparently not at Golden Gate VVCA.

Lloyd
