&gt; My question is, &quot;What, if anything needs to be done to a bus

crossing the

down.  Did
&gt; you have to change timing or anything like that to get it to run
right?

No, I did not change timing or mixture at all.  It ran fine, though a
bit down on power.  

I would probably have had slightly better performance and mileage if I
had leaned the mixture and advanced the timing a bit but I didn't for
three reasons:

1. I'm lazy

2. Once the engine is set up for high altitude, it is dangerous to
bring it down to the low country.  I'd be setting myself up for
overheating.

3. A rich mixture runs a bit cooler on long climbs.

The best advice that I can give for running around in the mountains is
to be patient.  It's better to run at moderately high RPMs in third
than to lug the engine in 4th.  The faster the engine spins the better
your cooling.

Oh yes, watch out for deer, elk, and antelope. :)
