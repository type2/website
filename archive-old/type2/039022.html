mike,
there were a bunch of companies out there doing the
camper conversion thing, if you could describe the pop
top and accesories im sure someone on the list could
identify it for you.   i have a riviera camper for
instance where my pop top goes straight up, but the
cabinetry looks very similar to the westy's.   can't
wait to here what kind it is.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Picked up an '81 Vanagon (still aircooled -
&gt; wooohoooo!!) and it has a bunch
&gt; of camper stuff, including a pop top.  At first I
&gt; thought Westfalia, but
&gt; then I started looking around and didn't see
&gt; anything with the Westfalia's
&gt; name on it.  There are lots of things that tell me
&gt; this conversion was done
&gt; in the states.  Like when I open the cabinets, the
&gt; hinges say USA.   So my
&gt; question(s):
&gt; 
&gt; Were there companies other than Westfalia that did
&gt; conversions?  Who were
&gt; they?  Any still around?  Did they use the Westfalia
&gt; parts?  Am I stuck with
&gt; something I am not going to be able to find parts
&gt; for (camping stuff)?  Any
&gt; other comments?
