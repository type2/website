Subject: brake booster repair

There's a place here in Dallas that's supposed to give great booster overhauls. I've never used them but have heard good things about them.H&amp;R Booster10328 OakwoodDallas, TX 75217972-286-5516 &gt;Boy it's bad to get old, my bus and I need new parts,
&gt;I have a 1973 bus that is in dire need of a vaccume
&gt;brake booster. Is there anyone out there that has good
&gt;one one that would be willing to part with it for a
&gt;price  + postage. Or where I can get a rebuild kit for
&gt;it. Please let me know. Phil Steve Elms'71 Bus'79 Vert
