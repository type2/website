Subject: Steering coupler

Greetings all

While doing some work on the ol' bus today I crawled under to see how bad the
steering coupler was. As suspected it was cracked and needs to be replaced.
Any suggestions on replacing this thing? It looks pretty straight forward but
are there any secrets to making the job easier? Anyone know the size of the
bolts off hand so I can get some new ones before I start? One strange thing
is, there is a wire that runs from between the nut to under the head of one of
the bolts for the coupler. Any idea what it could be for? One end of the wire
has broken so it isn't doing anything anyway. What would be wired to the
coupler like this?

Thanks!
