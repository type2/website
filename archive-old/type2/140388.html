Subject: Re: [T2] Must-Have Item - Cup Holder/Storage Unit for Bus

From: &quot;The Bus Depot&quot; &lt;type2_at_busdepot_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Hmmm...I wonder if you could pick up a small round plastic ash tray
somewhere that would sit inside one of the cup holders...

Speaking of weird coincidences, I found one of those in an empty home today
whilst doing my job.  It's made by LDM for Ford.  A bit of Internet
searching brought up a number of these &quot;ash cups&quot; for different Ford
vehicles.

This one's missing its lid, the part number is F8C6-5404788.  It's from an
older vehicle, though I did find ash cups for various 2005 models.  They're
usually listed as &quot;ash/coin cups&quot;.
