Subject: 7 or 9seater owners - what's in the back?

Have been looking for the covering that goes over the engine bay in 68-72
busses... some folks have said a rubber mat, some have said a piece of
plywood. Anyone have one or the other that they KNOW is original?
I have a 70 DELUXE, so that might make a difference..........
