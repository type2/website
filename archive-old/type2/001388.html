Is there a significant decrement in braking performance if the brake booster
is disabled in a 74 bus? My situation is unusual because my single cab is a
1970 but has a 1974 nose. It has front disc brakes and a brake booster. The
brake booster now is connected to my single port intake mainfold. I'm
considering putting a dual port engine in and am wondering how to configure
the brake booster in this situation.  If there is no way to hook up the
booster hose can I just block it off?

Also, if I put a complete engine with an alternator in the vehicle with an
engine that now has a generator what changes do I need to make?

Sorry if these are stupid questions. TIA,

Martin, Austin, Tx
