Subject: Hunk-a Horse Hair 

The bare springs of the  seats on the early bays (pun intended) seem to be 
covered in what is euphemistically called 'horse hair' pads.

I was going to trash a bed mattress box spring (similar to a platform), and 
I thought to tear it apart to see what made it tick (another intentional 
pun),

The springs of the mattress box springs were layered over with something 
that/which reminded me of the 'horse hair' padding on my '72 seats.

I tore off a full sheet of this 'horse hair' padding.  It is pliable enough 
to make into a roll for storage.

I am wondering:  would it be possible to replace the 'horse hair' padding on 
my '72 (30 year old stuff) with the padding from the box spring mattress??  
Looks the same; smells the same; tastes the same...

And suggestions or thoughts??  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Yes, I am on a fishing expedition...  
;-)

A grateful driver thanks all the bald backed horses out there who gave their 
hair for the base on my '72 seats.  Sorry to replace your noble efforts with 
a trashed out box spring mattress....  But isn't that how we play the game  
in type 2 land.??
