Hi Glen,

Your Mileage May Vary, but I can see a few parallels to my '79 Westy, 
specifically, the snaps in the front and the pass side rear quarter.

&gt;3.  It also appears that there are snaps by the front and rear corners
&gt;of the door, for one large curtain to cover the windshield and door 
&gt;windows.  Is this the correct arrangement for a Westy?

My '79 still has the original front curtain, and it snaps into those 4 
locations.  Mine also has 2 plastic buttons above the center mirror which 
could have snaps in them as well.  As I recall, I can get away with hooking 
the top edge of the curtain over the mirror for now.

&gt;4.  Any pointers on the curtain for the passenger side, rear quarter?  How 
&gt;difficult is it to pull out the closet, etc. back there to get into the 
&gt;window?

My '79 has a cabinet on the ceiling above the engine, as well as the cabinet 
in the rear quarter.  I was looking at this the other day, and it appears 
that you need to remove the top cab (4 screws, each corner) before you can 
remove the side cab.  For all cabinets, the screws or bolts appear to be 
relatively easily accessible, though they may not be readily obvious.

The other two applications appear to be more specific to your vintage of 
Bus.  My slider has a rod above it that's bent to the shape of the slider 
track, and is similar to the other curtain rods.  The bow behind the seats 
seems to have been deleted on later years, but it seems like a good idea for 
separating the cab from the rest of the Bus.  That could be useful for more 
efficient heating, since the cab area is so much smaller than the whole Bus 
volume.

Good luck -- privacy is very important for those of us who sleep in our 
Buses!
