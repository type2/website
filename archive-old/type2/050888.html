You said it David!  I finally got my 1980 AC working
for one year, last year.  The problem I seem to keep
having is the seal on the bottom of the aluminum York
compressor.  Mine is leaking again.  My York is a
rotolock fitting compressor, and uses squashable
(extruded) teflon looking seals.  As soon as you
remove the hoses, you need new seals.  The proper
seals are not exactly a short cylinder, but have an
almost imperceptible taper to them.  The narrow side
faces the compressor's fitting.  Details like this can
be frustrating when no one else knows about the
system.

In the past, I&quot;ve tried a refrigerant blend, but it
only lasted a couple weeks.  For this system you need
the real R12, and you have to be certified to buy it
(I am).  This is an aftermarket system, and I found
one hose routed through the firewall with no grommet. 
I found a pin hole leak where it rubbed the firewall.

The bad thing about this system is I don't know where
you could get parts like the condensor fans,
condensor, drier/sight glass, the compressor has an
undersized pulley, etc...  They probably are available
since I believe the aftermarket system was totally
American made.  The other bad thing is there is not
much cooling for anyone in the back.

The great thing is the driver and passenger are pretty
confortable even on a blazingly hot day.  Also, this
system does not use the cabinet over the bench seat,
so you have full use of this space.

&gt; The compressor is mounted &quot;backwards&quot;.  The belt is
&gt; behind the fan housing.  Unfortunately, it's a
&gt; narrow, non-standard belt and I would be willing to
&gt; bet that yours is missing.  Last I checked the belts
&gt; were still available at the dealer for about $20,
&gt; but be warned that replacing the belt might just be
&gt; the beginning of the costs associated with getting
&gt; the A/C working.
