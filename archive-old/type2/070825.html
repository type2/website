Subject: The early pop top hinges
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello, first of all I'd like to thank all of you for the warm welcome to the 
list.  And thank you for all of the great responses to my questions.  As for 
the hinges, when I go 60 on the freeway or 50 on a windy day the front part 
of the pop top on my 70 westy lifts up about one inch.  It makes creeking 
noises and pops!  Is there a way to adjust these hinges?  Because when I 
drive in the rain on the freeway in leake in!  NOT GOOD!  It's going in 
storage soon anyway but maybee I can fix it with the helpful knowledge of you 
kind people!
Thanks again.
