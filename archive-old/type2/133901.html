Subject: Re: [T2]leak at master cylinder

Hi Mike......I too had a leak that I thought was the hose supplying the 
master cylinder but
it turned out to be a defective brake light switch was leaking fluid through 
itself somehow. It
was a cheap five dollar fix for a new brake light switch. Hope your repair is 
as easy.
