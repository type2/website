&gt; next idea is to use the heat from the top of the case to warm up that
&gt; manifold. has anybody done any thing like this. BTW I made the air
&gt; cleaner out of two late bus hubcaps, two rabbit hubcaps , two 90 degree
&gt; pvc elbows and a tractor air filter. if you have any ideas I would love
&gt; to hear them
Brian:
You'll probably NOT love to hear my ideas! Type 1 engines used exhaust
gas to heat the manifold runners. That's a LOT of BTU's! I don't think
there are that many BTU's available from your case.
I think that for all the work that you've gone to and still need to do
it would have been easier to fix the FI. (That's what your wife has been
saying all along, right?)
