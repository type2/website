&gt; do think there are a few other small differences overall, I once heard
&gt; mention of no firewall in the engine compartments of '68s, is this true?

Another difference on the 71 that I haven't seen mentioned is the slight
flare in the body for the rear tires.
Also, I recall that the 68 came with a rubber mat in the rear cargo area
whereas my 70 has a fiber/felt mat which has shrunk a bit over the past 34
years.
