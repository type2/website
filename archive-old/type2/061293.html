&gt; Ok, for the straight dope. I have a 73 Type II Westy- It is in need of
&gt; major body repair (rust) and is a major eyesore. (westy orange spotted with
&gt; grey primer and rust holes. ) I have a line on a dead vanagon 2.0 FI
&gt; aircooled (80-83.5), and for the sake of beauty (and my wife allowing me to
&gt; keep a VW) I am considering starting a frankenbus project.
&gt;
&gt; I am interested in any Faq/Procedures that would allow me to swap an 1800cc
&gt; T4 into an 80-83 Vanagon- From the information I know- It is somewhat
&gt; complex.
&gt;
&gt; Issues to address:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Clutch/Flywheel which is better? Is there a clearance problem with the
&gt; tranny ? The Pre 83.5 Vanagons are 2.0FI. Will it Bolt up ?
&gt; 2. Heads &amp; Exhaust- I think the Vanagon exhaust and heatboxes are
&gt; different. Do I have to switch the heads, heatboxes and exhaust ?
&gt; 3. Deck clearance- I have a webber progressive kit- Will it clear the deck
&gt; lid ? Or do I have to switch it to FI ?
&gt; 4. Oil Dipstick Placement ?
&gt;  and so on...
&gt; So many questions to ask.. So if there is a step procedure to make an
&gt; frankenbus with a T4 and a Vanagon chassis, could somebody send me the
&gt; info.
Jason:
There are more differences than that:
The rear mounts and hanger are different, the engine sheet metal is
different, the fan housing and heater blower fan are different.
In theory, maybe you could chop and weld the rear mount from the 1800 to
fit the Vanagon frame, rig up some engine tin, changer either the clutch
and flywheel to  the Vanagon ones or put the 1800 starter on, and then
worry about wiring. Sounds like a LOT of work to get that Vanagon to
move, albeit slowly.
Unless there is a rod hanging out the bottom of the Vanagon motor, or if
it's been run low on oil, I think it might be easier and cheaper to fix
the heads, put in new rings or p&amp;c's, and put the Vanagon motor back
together. Don't even bother with the bottom end if you can somehow
determine that the rods aren't loose, don't split the case, don't take
off the clutch or flywheel. This plan works best if it's a car you can
drive before taking apart and can determine that the problems are  in
the heads or rings. These bottom ends are really strong and last a long
time IF they have oil.
The old 1800 engine will have some value being together and you should
be able to sell it to someone else to finance a top end overhaul.
I guess I harbor a lot of distrust of doing engine swaps (unless the
engines are EXACTLY the same) because there are so many opportunities to
make the vehicle horribly worse when your main goal is to fix a broken
motor. The only parts that are the same in these two motors are the
rocker covers, the rocker arms, the fan, the oil cooler, and the bolts!
Seems like fixing the Vanagon motor would have a lot better odds of
success.
