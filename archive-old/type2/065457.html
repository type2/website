Subject: Re: Brake Master Cylinder advice?

&gt;I am removing the brake master cylinder from my 1969 bus, and I'm 
&gt;a little stuck at the clevis pin.  Seems the pin is rusted to the 
&gt;clevis so hard that the ball peen hammer and punch method is not 
&gt;enough. 
&gt;
&gt;I think my next attempt will be vise grips with a hammer (get it to 
&gt;turn and then it might hammer back out) or else heating it may help.
&gt;I've gotten out rusty bolts before but this one is particularly stuck.
&gt;Hacksaw time?  (I do not think the clevis pin comes with the new cylinder,
&gt;and it is a fairly weird part to try to get at a LAPS)
&gt;Is there another approach I could take?  I'm wont to 
&gt;remove the whole brake pedal assembly, and not sure that will help 
&gt;anyway.  It'll end up being simple to do, but I want to throw this 
&gt;to you experienced folks.  Muir is vague, and chilton only has bug
&gt;brakes.
I'd put about a 13mm socket on the head side of the clevis pin (to catch
it), and use a C clamp such that one jaw is on the socket and the other is
on the end of the pin.  Then tighten the clamp and drive the pin into the
socket.
