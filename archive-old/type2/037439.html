Subject: Erratic Tach

Group:  
    This is my first post to this group.  I really look forward to gaining new insights into my '77 Westy.  Re the tach problem, I think the advice regarding checking connections and dist. points is sound advice.  One more thing that could possibly be causing the trouble is the distributor rotor.  I cured the same sort of symptoms on another vehicle ('90 Trooper) just by changing the rotor.  It's a cheap try and a minor tune-up would reap other benefits as well.  Cap, points, condenser and rotor is what I'd try.  Later.
