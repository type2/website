&gt; To the very good advice from Jeff S. I would add this: get a copy of Ron
&gt; Fournier's book on metal fabricating (there are two; one of them is
&gt; co-authored by his wife Sue).
&gt; 
&gt; As you learn to weld, also try hammerforming with body tools and a shot
&gt; bag. Don't expect your early work the be worth much; this takes some time
&gt; and practice.
&gt; 
&gt; There are very few body panels on a bus that can not be hand-fabricated
&gt; if you have the patience to learn. By the time you can turn out a good
&gt; replacement panel, you'll be ready to move on to the bus itself. Steel
&gt; isn't cheap, but it is way less expensive than proprietary repair panels.
Mark:
Actually, steel IS cheap. Just get an air chisel, the right bits, and a
few elderly American car hoods (bonnets to you UK guys and Ozzies) or
doors. Cut em up. This product- called &quot;tin&quot; in the scrap metal trade is
nearly valueless($30/ ton or so) and most any recycler would gladly sell
you  a hood for a few dollars. In fact, they'd probably zip off the skin
for you so you didn't have to handle the scrap framework. Just stay away
&gt;from late model cars that use high strength steel(don't know the years
that this came in, sometime in the 80's I'd guess).
