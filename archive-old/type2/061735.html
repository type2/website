&gt;
&gt;Well, it's now 4 months since they received the cores and no refund or
&gt;explanation.  I've called 3 times and each time they say they will look &gt;into
&gt;it and call me back...

&gt;Needless to say, they haven't called back.  Has anyone else run into &gt;this
&gt;problem?


Indeed I also have had this problem.
MSHP still ows me $200. They never return phone calls and can never tell
you anything.
I am sure this is their business policy, no company can be that
incompetent, and it definitely increases their profits.
I am also not so thrilled by their technical capabilities. Both heads
they send me had flaws. One head I sent back on warranty and they never
refunded the shipping (another $15). This head had a bad spark plug
thread. Talk about no quality control.
I've given up on them and my money. Now everybody knows.
