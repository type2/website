Subject: FOR SALE:  68 PopTop Campmobile in Southern California
Date: Fri, 9 Oct 1998 10:04:06 -0700 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have too many projects in my driveway so I need to move out my 68 Westy
PopTop Campmobile.  I have not driven in about 8 months due to a bad tranny.
Since then I borrowed the engine and the headlights.  So to be fully
functional again it would need motor, tranny, and headlight buckets(and
lights).  Good tires and good vehicle otherwise.

Modified with propane system, second battery, three way refrigerator which
all works.  Pop top is off and so is many body rubber(I am in the process of
redoing those things).

Asking $300.  Bus is located in Northern San Diego County.
