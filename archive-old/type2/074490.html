Subject: Electrical problems

I've got a 1978 Bus with an alternator light that does not come on when the 
ignition is switched on, or when the engine is first started. It illuminates 
after the revs reach 1500, then stays on until the engine is turned off. The 
oil pressure light never illuminates, the turn signals do not work, but the 
hazard lights do, and the gas gauge does not work. The symptoms appeared 
intermittently at first, but have now settled in for the duration. The 
battery is holding its charge. The bulbs are all good. Wire wiggling under 
dash does no good.

What do we have here, a bad voltage stabilizer? My understanding of that is 
that makes the gas gauge reasonably accurate. Bad oil pressure sending unit? 
It makes no sense that that would take down the other electrics.

Does anyone have any ideas what might be the solution? Any thoughts are 
appreciated. Honestly, I'd rather work on my wife's MG's electrics than try 
to figure this one out! Call it a deal with the devil, but I actually 
understand Lucas electrics! Bosch must be too simple.

Thanks

John
