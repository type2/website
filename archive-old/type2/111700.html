Subject: Re: [T2] strange tank under seat

I too, own a 74, and the little tank I have under the
driver seat is the brake fluid reservoir, I found this
out when my Master Cylinder went bad, and I had to
replace it.  I'd put money on that being what you are
looking at.

Peace, Love, &amp; Happiness!!!
