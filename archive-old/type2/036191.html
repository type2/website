&gt;Hi ya'll-
&gt;
&gt;I'm looking at maybe buying a rebuilt starter
&gt;for my 77 Loaf.  Do these typically include
&gt;the solenoid as well?

Typically, yes. Always on Bosch Reman.

&gt;My starter currently stays engaged,even after
&gt;the key is switched back to off. I have to
&gt;disconnect the battery to get it
&gt;to kick out.
&gt; 
&gt;I recently replaced just the solenoid, which
&gt;worked for a while, and this problem arose.
&gt;So I'm thinking a whole &quot;new&quot; unit would be the
&gt;way to go.

Genuine Bosch Reman will put the problem behind you for a looooong time.

  I can't think of anything other
&gt;than a malfunctioning solenoid that would
&gt;cause this to happen. 

A drop of oil on the gear engagement linkage points and for the gear bore
might do wonders, also, might come back soon to haunt you if the problem is
wear as opposed to just dry interfaces. An old tired weak return spring
could well be at play.

(I have an aftermarket
&gt;push button start switch, like an airplane,
&gt;so I don't think it's related to that.)

I always verify adequacy of aftermarket stuff before addressing original
systems components 'cause about 50% of the time, that's it.
Doityourselferism leads to mixed results. Advanced DIYs have learned that
not spending enough now for long term results can result in much wasted
time/money then having in the end to pay the price do it right in addition
if a better result can be honestly expected.
