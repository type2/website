Subject: Re: [T2] DOT 5

Also not absorbing water at all means that instead of mixing in with the fluid
as it does with 3 and 4 and eventually lessening the effectiveness of the brake
system, water will sit in the low spots, (or high i forget which is denser, i
think water is) and rust out the system where it sits, and may also result in a
&quot;bubble&quot; of water in the system, dot 5 is great for people who change their
brake fluid fairly often but not for more typical users where it is unchanged
for years,
