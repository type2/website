Subject: funny bumper sticker

Hello,
Here's a funny bumper sticker a friend saw on an old bus (she's not very 
well-versed on her Volkswagens, so she doesn't know what it was):
&quot;Honk if anything falls off&quot;    :) 
I could use one of those.  But it won't do me any good until Cassidy's  
drivable!

Amy :)
