&gt; Is there anybody out there who knows the details regarding the swap meet
&gt; at the Maple Grove show tomorrow?  In particular, I want to find out how
&gt; much it costs, how much space one gets, and if there's an earlier
&gt; opening time for swapers to set up before the gates open at 8:00 am, and
&gt; info like that.  I've got a lot of stuff I'd like to get rid of; but
&gt; don't have the time to organize my stuff enough to justify a high swap
&gt; space fee (where high = the $50 they charged at Manassas -- I was the
&gt; guy with the magic-markered list of parts for sale on my t-shirt).  If
&gt; it's expensive, maybe somebody would like to share a space, hmm?

The last time I was in the swapmeet area it was in the $35 range if memory
serves me correctly, but that was several years ago.  Maple Grove usually
does have a very large swap meet area, though, bigger than most.  I think
you can get in at 7 to set up.

&gt; Bus Depot / Ron: I assume you'll have a full assortment of tune up parts
&gt; 'n' stuff like that, yes?

Yes.
