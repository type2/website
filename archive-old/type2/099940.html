Subject: confused about oil weight

Hi all-

Would like to change the oil in my '71 Bus, but all these different weights I 
must admit are confusing me.  According to the owner's manual, the 
recommendations are:

SAE 30 - warm seasons and all year in areas with hot climate
SAE 20W-20 - in winter
SAE 10W - in areas where average temp. is below 5 deg. F
SAE 5W - in areas with arctic climate and temp. below -13 deg. F

I live in New York City, and I would guess the SAE 30 is the one to use.  But 
I remember oils all having a designation of &quot;10W-??&quot; (or sometimes &quot;5W-??&quot;), 
never just a single number.  Am I missing something, or did the brain cells 
go south for the winter??

Thanks.
Larry
