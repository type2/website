&gt; [T2] Foot well mystery???
&gt;
&gt; On my 1973 bus, when you open the door, there is this
&gt; little &quot;step&quot;. On the passengers side there is a little
&gt; rubber mat covering it. On the drivers side it is just metal,
&gt; without the little rubber mat. There are 3 holes there. Who
&gt; would sell the little mat??


I have them new for $8.95 each ('72-79), part number 211 863 735 (left) or
736 (right).  For '68-71, they're $64.95/pair (211 898 291) or $32.95 for
left side only (211 863 291). Right side '68-71 not sold separately.
