Subject: Re: [T2] Brake servo rebuild kit?

I'm glad to see that others have had good luck with H&amp;R also.  Mine has 
been working perfectly for about five years now since they rebuilt it, and 
it was just over $70 (I'm local so I didn't have to pay 
shipping).  Specialty shops like H&amp;R are almost extinct today - I hope 
everyone needing booster repair will consider using H&amp;R.

&gt;Mine cost $81 including shipping and they did it the day they got it and
&gt;sent it back the next day.
