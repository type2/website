&gt; Can't remember exactly - either caliper is removed or the pads slide in

front pads just slide out I did my 78 today and was done in less than an
hour.
jack up side
remove wheel/tire
knock out two pins on caliper, 
remove spring
push old pad back to open space. push back far enough for new pad to fit
pull old pad out
push new pad in (check anti squeal plate or goop is in place)
put one pin in
put spring in
put second pin in. 
make sure they are seated fully
put tire back on
repeat on other side

clean up mess where you forgot to suck some fluid out of brake fluid
resevoir before starting.

finished

&gt; You'll probably need to bleed the system anyhow. Might be a good time the 
&gt; flush the system.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd advise you spend a bit of money and buy a good shop manual (this a good 
&gt; excuse!) - I prefer Bentley but the Haynes will certainly do the job. Even 
&gt; Muir got this part right I think (I like his book too).

&gt; &gt;It kinda looks like the calipers spilt, but when I loosen the fluid comes 
&gt; &gt;out?  Please advise.
