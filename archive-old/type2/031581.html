&gt; I need to replace the tranny on my 71 Westy. The CVs are pretty bad so a

&gt; complete w/axles. Does anyone know who might sell them? Of course I'm on the 
&gt; rust coast--NJ.

don't throw the baby out with the bath water, CV joints are about $50
complete from several sources.   and contray to some recent kvetching here
are not usually that hard to change.  but all 4 CV's rarely go bad at the
same time.   half shafts are next to impossible to hurt, I have never seen
one go bad in the 30+ years of driving a VW.

tranny's are not outragous but unless you are actually having problems,
why bother with the hassle of changing em. unless you are doing the work
yourself the most expensive cost will be the labor not the tranny, maybe
$250 for the tranny and $1,500 or so in labor costs.

this &quot;friend&quot; how knowledgable is he/she about VW vans??
get a second opinion
