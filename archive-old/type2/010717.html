&lt;&lt; All my sockets are 3/8 drive, but if a
 1/2 inch drive torque is better, then I'd just load up on 1/2 inch
 sockets.  I notice that the 3/8 wrench goes from about 5 to 80 ft/lbs.,
 whereas the 1/2 goes from 25 to 250.  Which one would be a better
 purchase, and if I go for the 1/2 inch drive, then what about the proper
 torques below 25 ft/lbs.?  I can't afford both. &gt;&gt;

take a look in any vw repair manual...i believe most torque needs fall under
80 lbs.  i have one.  a 3/8.  the only other times you need to go over 80 lbs
torque there are other ways to do it ..... i.e. a 250 lb man * x * amount over
feet away from the nut, standing on a breaker bar...etc.
