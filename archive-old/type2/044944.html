hmmmm, we don't have much, but maybe a reward fund, if no one claims it
pass it off to her parents for the care of the dogs and safe disposal of
her bus?????

I don't know, thinking out loud, sure wish there was something we could
do?!

&gt; Charlie Ford spoke to Kristin Laurite's family on the phone today.
&gt; 
&gt; While several people on the lists/ng have spoken of sending
&gt; flowers/remembrances, and of course we want to do that for the very best
&gt; reasons, the family are not receptive to hearing from strangers over
&gt; this awful event.
&gt; 
&gt; That is understandable given the horror of Kristin's murder, the
&gt; national publicity that is happening now and the fact that we are
&gt; complete strangers to them. We can greive for her in private without
&gt; upsetting the family further.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, if you have ANY useful information on the killing of Kristin
&gt; Laurite please call Officer Cleve Keeling at (501) 354-2411.
