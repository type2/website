Well, I wouldn't describe it as &quot;shooting&quot;...it's not even a driple.


&gt;   i do use a small little ring on my dipstick but it just helps to seal it
&gt; better when its pushed in.. it wouldnt stop anything strong in force of
&gt; oil....
&gt;
&gt;   i ran my hose from the air breather on top of the crankcase to the
&gt; outside under the battery tray instead of in my carb and the crankcase
&gt; pressure balanced and i now have no oil shooting out my dipstick...

Thanks...I'll try those suggestions.
