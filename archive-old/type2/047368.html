There are some similar USA-made lightweight trailers available.  Check the
ads in the back of magazines like SUNSET, FAMILY CIRCLE, etc.

We see them often being pulled by ancient Civics and Corollas.

We've also seen teardrop-style camping trailers small enough to be towed by
motorcycles.

The DPO of our '70 Westy hauled a conventional US travel trailer from Bend,
OR to Fairbanks, AK and back.  Probably why I had to replace a trashed
transaxle, rebuild the engine, and repair mangled rear shock mount towers.

&gt;&gt;  The American RVs are very heavy, and the only lighter ones are the tent
trailers, which are still too heavy for a VW bus to tow.  &lt;&lt;
