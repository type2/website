Brian Verbeek says about the assertion that 60,000 litres of air per minute
flow through a Bus engine compartment:

&gt;&gt; Those numbers seem awfully high to me.  I don't think 1000 liters per second
&gt;&gt; could even fit through the air vents.
&gt; 
&gt; I pulled those figures out of memory, but just to make sure I pulled the
&gt; 1969 Engine manual from VW AG, there is an update page dated 11.73,
&gt; It lists, among other things, the following figures on the amount of air
&gt; that the cooling system displaces:

That's less than 2300 cfm--sounds reasonable to me.
