but I wanted to say it anyway. Just thanks to everybody who has been helping
me out. I've been on the list about a week, and the second I started asking
questions I was thrown a wonderful, funny, and extremely helpful heap of
repsonses from so many people. The advice is wonderful. I've learned so much
just from reading the posts; all of them, not just the ones related to my
situation. I can see why so many of you have been on the list so long. 

I feel like I joined this groovy little VW community, even though I don't
know what your faces look like. :)

Back to the regularly scheduled program. 

Thanks again!
