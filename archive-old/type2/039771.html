Subject: Tool question

Ok, so I've finally gotten frustrated with not having the right tools to
work on my bus, and my birthday is coming up, so I have a couple of tool
questions for the list (and will probably start a religious war in the
process).  This is mostly regarding sockets, screwdrivers, wrenches and
simple automotive test equipment.

1. What brand of tools have you found to be reasonably (everthing is
relative here) priced but built well enough that you won't have to worry
about snapping your wrench in half getting those exhaust bolts out?

2. What's the big deal between 6 point sockets/wrenches and 12 point
sockets/wrenches?  Why would I want to have one over the other, or both?

3. How often (if ever) am I going to need deep sockets or universal sockets
or crowfoot wreches or anything beyond the basic socket/extension/handle
configuration?

Thanks all,
Niall

'76 Westy (Frances) currently sans engine - and yes, for those who are
interested, the case was quite cracked and throwing oil into the fan
housing.  Even the magnesium fan housing was somewhat cracked.  Looks like
this baby had been baked by the PO.  A rebuilt AVP engine is on it's way to
me as we speak.
