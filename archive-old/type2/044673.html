&gt; Matthew, a memory comes of someone being pissed off about this and drilling
&gt; out the spotwelds holding that bit in (they are at the end I think, its
&gt; raining here) and replacing them with self tapping screws. Bingo! Just like
&gt; the other one, you take it out when you want. Worth checking.

My rear engine piece is bashed in and I'd like to pound it out to make the
lid close again.  Can I just drill out the spot welds and beat it flat
again?  The piece seemed fairly thick to me, but I suppose it could just be
the tin that I was looking at.
