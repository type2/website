Subject: [T2] WOOHOO! Succesful tranny work

So far :)
I dropped the 70's motor and tranny to replace my nosecone (o72 to 091) and
do some other fidgets.
Symptoms: 198K tranny, sloppy shifting, noise in neutral, reverse a hunt.
Cure: replace nose w/ a beefier one, getting new seals and -most
importantly - roller bearings insted of a brass bushing for the hockey
stick. Also got a steel 'ball' for the detent lever to replace the plastic
one. Had the new nose cone spotfaced, and got the bearing retainer plate,
all from Weddle Engineering... total was about $70 w/ shipping, and I got
some back when I sent in my cores.

If you haven't done this - DO IT!!!!!

My hockey stick bushing was 80% GONE; it should look like a hollow thimble
but it looked like a thumbnail. My main bearing had been popping forwards,
and had ground the face of the nose cone into a deep circular pit (this is
what the retainer plate prevents). It ALSO was spinning in the case - a
major badbadbad, but not much can be done about it w/out machine work.
Loctite was discussed and dismissed, and the bearing plate was told to hold
the bearing from turning, fingers were crossed, chickens were sacrificed,
etc.
I noticed a spare 71 case had a weird 'waning moon' bearing and a LARGE
woodruff key to keep this from spinning; I would try to do something
similar if you have the resources.

I managed to goof up the shifter detents the first time - found out AFTER
it was in the car, natch!  Nose came back off, much studying of books was
done (also looked at the digicam photos I took during removal to see how it
originally went. Finally felt the $$ things were useful after all ;) ), and
a shifter cheater we cobbled up was employed. This is basically  half a
shifter coupler w/ a bent pipe attached; it allows you to actually shift
the thing BEFORE it is in the car. Got it working, put it in neutral and
put it in.

Motor went in in FIVE MINUTES, I swear!! I spent 10 minutes trying to
figure out what I did wrong; it usually takes me 3 or 4 tries. I was
spooked. Got the coupling together and went to bed, as it was too dark to
work efficiently.

Finished the job the next day; new fuel line (installed a shut-off valve)
and hooked everything up; replaced the shifter. Start it up and...... no
1st and 2nd :P
Some adjustment at the shifter base and SUCCESS!!
I now have an unnervingly tight and crisp shifter.. I am frightened to
think what may happen if I replace all my shift rod bushings.
It shifts like a fairly new car; but now I have to relearn the damn
pattern!  Also, I no longer hear the dreaded moan at idle, but I haven't
driven it long enough to get it hot, so we'll see.
Lewis was skeptical; he sees my spending money on new stuff and shakes his
head (&quot;Did them internet people tell you that? HUHhuhuh)&quot;), but this cheap
fix actually impressed a 30-year VW mechanic. He wants to do it to HIS bus
now! My theory is that a cripser shift pattern and less slop will mean less
wear on the tranny, which means more time before it goes completely (they
CAN last 300K), so a 10% investment on the cost of a rebuild will hopefully
pay up in spades.

I will try and get some photos up Sunday. I'm crossposting this to the
splitty folks; not so much coz it's useful to them so much as to brag :)
