Karl,

The Bentley shows only the wiring diagram it does not show the physical
switch. Only those that have wires attached to them. You are correct that
the diagram does not show the 57 attachment as I stated below 57 not used in
73 and later. Yes all 211 941 531 E switches have a terminal 57 this is used
in 71 and 72 but not later. As you stated this is for the dash indicator
light.

&gt; Karl,
&gt;
&gt; I am not sure which switch you have and what you are referring to in the
&gt; Bentley manual. I see (Bentley light switch E1) and note that the '71
model
&gt; is the same as the '72 and later models. This holding true that, if you
have
&gt; a '71 bus you use switch 211 941 531 E. The terminals are as follows.
&gt;
&gt; 56
&gt; 58
&gt; 30 two wire
&gt; 57 not used in 73 and later
&gt; 58b
&gt; X

And ALL your E switches have terminal 57 on them??  Bullcrap, look again.

And if you look again in the Bentley, you will see terminal 57 is only on 71
and
72.

Did you not get the picture I attached in the pmail I sent you? Compare that
to
a E switch like I said when I pmailed you. Or did you not receive my 1st
message, it went just to you.
