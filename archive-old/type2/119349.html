Subject: Re: [VB] Dipstick heater

Yea--Kinda like me a month ago changing the fuel filter on my 85 GL and
having a couple of drips of gas land on the bulb--
I blew out from under the Van on the creeper in a ball of flame--

This light bulb heat for the engine is a Beddy Beddy bad idea--

If someone needs a sump bolt on heater for their Bus--I have a perfect
one--$35.00

Much safer than the bulbo flame out--

I've never seen a melted Bus before--
I wonder what that looks like--

Later,

Terry
