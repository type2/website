Subject: more trash

Last night, I put into the trash container  a crossover pipe from a '77 bus. 
  I broke the studs off getting it apart, but someone might be able to work 
with it.

Also put into the trash container the rear bearer bar (moustache bar) from 
same '77, with one bracket.

Trash pickup is on Monday.  Gotta get them before then.

Same proposal as H2O container: free to good home; pickup.

PS.  A lot of more stuff is going out the door, like cooling tin..  Keep 
tuned
