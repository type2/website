It somewhat looks like in the picture that the cylider head is beat (some 
mushrooming of the metal)  where the cylinder contacts it, especially on 
the right side.  The left side sure appears that it wasn't sealed as 
indicated by the soot path.

I suspect that head was loose.

&gt; this sounds almost exactly like my bad head where there were no gaskets
&gt; when there should have been.  I guess you did check the torque on the
&gt; head bolts...maybe one or two pulled loose??? just grabbing at ideas
&gt; here
&gt; 
&gt; good luck
&gt; Bob
