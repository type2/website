Importance: Normal

&gt; Just curious about Bus books.  Specifically, those that list the
&gt; various years and the dates or chassis numbers that certain changes
&gt; occurred.  So far I've come up with the following:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;VW Transporter  Die technische Dokumentation 1950-1990&quot;, Stefan Doliwa.
&gt; I got this book in Germany and it's in German.  I am learning all kinds
&gt; of German words for the parts of a Bus now.  Allegedly there's an English
&gt; version but I haven't been able to find it.


Well, now you have.  It was just reissued in English as &quot;Volkswagen Model
Documentation.&quot; It details the
important dates, changes, and milestones in each model's production run,
including quotes from press, test articles, photos, and information from
internal Volkswagen documents. It also includes a history of Volkswagen.  It
covers all VW buses/vans thru 1991, plus Beetle, Ghia, Types 3 and 4, Thing,
and Porsche 914.  240 pages, 247 photographs.

My shipment of these books is arriving next week, and just yesterday I
offered a pre-order listmember deal to the Vanagon list. Your email reminded
me that I should have offered the bus lists the same deal.

The listmember pre-order price is $19.95. (Cover price $30.) This price is
good thru until Wednesday (which is about when they are due in), after which
the ongoing price will be a few bucks more.  Part number GVM1. You can order
via the website, or toll-free at 1-866-BUS-DEPOT.  The price is higher to
the general public, so you must specify that you are a listmember to get
this price.
