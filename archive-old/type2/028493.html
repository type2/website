Hmmm, all right you type 4 zealots just wait a minute ;-)  Remember we are
on the same air-cooled team here.

Granted there aren't many of 'em out there but let's examine a thoughtfully
modified type 1 engine (I hereby christen thee a T1-tm) on a par with a type
4, or maybe just as bullet proof.  Much of the increased longevity in a T4
is simply due to full flow filtering and better cooling...easily
accomplished on the T1. The case alloy is improved on the T4 although later
new T1 cases use the same alloy.  Aside from a new case, you will not find
the following on your factory new T4 engine: counterweighted crank, cc'd and
polished heads, rods balanced end to end within 1/4 gram, forged pistons
balanced to within 1/4 gram, and blueprinted assembly.  Did I mention fully
counterweighted crank and the turbine-like smoothness and longevity it adds?
You can balance a nickel on its edge next to the case split on a T1-tm at
idle rpm.

Add to that a T4 oil cooler (easy mod to the doghouse), FF oil filtering,
*correctly installed and working thermostat* (one of my main beefs and one
reason for Walmart parking lot rebuilds in the first place), proper
breathing and carburetion, every engine seal in place and you've got
something only remotely similar to a stock T1. Depending on the choice of
displacement you've got a Bus that'll either pull a wheelie or be
*extremely* reliable and as peppy as any T4 within 2-300cc.

Unfortunately most shops treat the &quot;lowly&quot; T1 with less than it's due
respect and pay attention to only about 80% of the necessary detail in what
I term a professional rebuild. These are the engines that have thermostats
left off, nothing is balanced, are incorrectly align bored, fuel filters put
in the engine compartment etc.  Dang, I could go on for pages about the
abuses I've seen to T1 engines. These are the ones that don't live as long.

Shame on you who shun the elegance of a &quot;like the engineers intended it&quot;
rebuilt T1 or a T1-tm.  It's where you started from.

Yeah,
I will bring a few sets of tires, and see how  many I can burn until they
blow, before I run out of gas...Just for fun!!

&gt; &gt; Or maybe the type 4 guys can keep the cooler stocked while the type 1
guys

&gt;
&gt; Rick:
&gt; Yes, they could stock the cooler AND make parts runs, because, of course,
their
&gt; buses would still be running and not NEED to be overhauled in the parking
lot
&gt; at Walmart.
&gt; Oh, they've had their share of problems with type 4's, but it's still the
best
&gt; bet.
