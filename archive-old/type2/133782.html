Subject: RE: [T2] 5 speed tranny

__________________________________________________________________________
Just heard about someone planning on installing
a European 094 5 speed for a vanagon into his
TICO conversion Westy.
   Wondering if it would be possible , within reason,
to put one in a late Bay...

Def. within reason: not a lot of hacking of body and such.
