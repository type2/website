Subject: Re: [T2] 77 Passenger Area Floor

I looked into this for the GWB.

The cargo sections should be fine, but keep in mind that any special bits
like the seat mounting brackets and such will not be on there. You'll have
to cut them off the old floor and weld them on the new. At least that's what
I was told a year ago.

Rather than go through all that, since the holes were just pinholes, I just
wire brushed the rust, wiped it with acetone, and used rust bullet.
