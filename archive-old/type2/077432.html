Subject: re: trailering a bus

I have a couple omore commments about trailering,
towing, etc.
U-Haul rates vary a lot--if you want to rent a trailer
one-way, and take it somewhere that they need more
trailers, it will be cheaper than taking it to a
location where they don't need more trailers.  In
other words, if lots of people are already renting
them in the midwest and ending up in California,  it
is costing the company money to return some of these
to the midwest where the demand is, so if you were
renting in CA and going to the midwest it would be
cheaper than the opposite--just an example, I don't
know where they might be short of trailers now.
Read all the fine print on the forms, etc.
Locally, I now just call a l ocal garage with a
wrecker or tilt bed truck, and find that to have them
haul something less than 100 miles is cheaper than me
renting the trailer and truck--I don't have access to
a tow vehicle presently.

When I did have a tow vehicle, it was cheaper to rent
a trailer for a day local use, even if I drove
hundreds of miles, as long as I returned it to the
same place I rented it.

Good luck.

Jim (in WIS)
