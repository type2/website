Subject: Re: [T2] Drivers door weight?

&gt; I have a nasty dent just in front of the drivers door about headlight
&gt; height. Need to remove the door to do a good job of smoothing the metal
&gt; because I cant reach around the door with the dolly and see the other
&gt; side to work the hammer. I don't have a helper to remove the door. I'm
&gt; thinking of building some kind of dolly to support the door during
&gt; removal and install. Anyone out there know how much the door weighs? Any
&gt; good ideas on supporting the thing while doing the job alone?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Tom

Tom,

While they're not light ( never weighed them, I dare say David's probably
right on his figure ), they can be managed singlehanded witbout support
mechanisms if you need to.

I've stripped the doors off a '79 &amp; a '75, and refitted the doors on a '72
manually by myself, and while I wouldn't say it was easy, it's doable.

Wind the window all the way down, so that you can use the window frame to
support the door with one hand or sholder while you're releasing or starting
the final/first bolts, and while you're aligning the door ( MUCH harder job,
preferably done somewhere that people can't hear you swear ;^).

Anyway, it ain't easy, but if I can do it myself, I'm sure you can, with a
little bit of grunting and swearing.

Hope this is of use.

All the best,
