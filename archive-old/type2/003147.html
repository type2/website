It tightens well.  I never torque any of them very tight.  But it seems to
fit snugly in the hole.  It seems to slip a bit on the last turns, but since
I'm not really cranking, it's hard to tell the difference between a spinning
plug and a plug that is seating correctly.  There is very little noticeable
difference between the two...

I am having the delightful problem of a constantly loosening #1 plug.  Most
of the times I can hear it or I check it to see if it's loose, but the other
day, it was literally spit out...

Does it tighten well when u re-install it?
