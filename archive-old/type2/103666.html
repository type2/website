Subject: Re: [T2] bumper reflective tape

&gt; I am trying to get LED's behind the original taillight lenses so that it
&gt; looks stock but has bright lights so you can be seen, starting with
&gt; stop/tail lights, hope to get turn signals working too, not going to
&gt; bother with backup light.

Bob there a quire a few folk making led replacements for all sorts of
things
heres one link for direct replacement 1156,1157 lamps.
Not cheap but should last a long time.
