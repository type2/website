Subject: Re: [T2] Am I wasting my time&gt;

Interestingly enough, I had the exact same crack on my 1500 case in my 
Ghia. I found it when I disassembled the top end for inspectin when I got 
the car. I figured someone had over torqued the head stud and pulled on the 
case saver too much.  My crack ended before it got to the boss, but did 
come over the top of the case.  

My fix (until I ever rebuild the engine and have it welded) was to drill 
the end of the crack to stop it from continuing. I used a 1/16&quot; drill bit, 
if I recall. I then opened up the crack slightly with a dremel and JB 
Welded it.

I ran the engine all this year without difficulty.  No leaks from there 
that I can see.

If you have it tore down, you might consider welding it.

Hey y'all
As I continued to clean the case from the puddlejumper I found what 
 appears to be a crack from the #1 top front head stud to the boss for 
the second small case nut.  This could be a result of the missing case 
nut.  Am I wasting my time trying to save this engine?  Pix can be
