Subject: disks too thin. spares anyone?

Took the brake disks in to Autozone tonight to have them resurfaced,
but they won't do it because they're a bit under spec thickness, maybe
by half a millimeter. The brakes do pulsate a bit, so I guess the
disks could be wobbly. I'm afraid to ask what a new pair would cost. 
Is it absolutely essential that I get replacements? Anything to look
out for when buying new ones, i.e., do they come in different
qualities? Anyone got a spare set fot sale?

Merci,

Sami
