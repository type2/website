Subject: Rear Brakes locked up - should I be concerned?

First of all.                           What year bus??????

If it is a pre '71 bay or splitty, it's prolly no big deal.  If it's a 
'71 or later, you might look into things &quot;with a jaundiced eye.&quot;

I replaced the front pads this weekend on Lurch.  The old ones were 
just a few millimeters thick.  My bus will STOP now.  I feel much 
better (safer).

I could not get the caliper off on the passenger side, so I was unable 
to inspect/repack the bearings on that side.  When I go to pick up my 
freshly painted rear bumper (thanks to Don Carron, fellow listee), I 
will have my friend Wade at Wade's Body Shop (shameless plug) see if he 
can bust those 17 mm bolts loose with an air impact wrench.  I have a 
1/2&quot; breaker bar - I just don't have 1/2&quot; sockets, and I keep breaking 
the adapter for my 3/8&quot; sockets.

Thanks for the bandwidth.
