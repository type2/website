Subject: $9 breadloaf a/c

I was at Home Depot today buying a misting system for
my backyard. (for you folks in humid climes, misters
spray a fog of water into the air around outdoor
restaurant terraces, etc. cooling the patrons through
evaporation).

I stumbled over a &quot;chilly mate.&quot; basically a liter
bottle with a mister valve on a hose at one end and a
pump handle at the other. You put in some water and
pressurize it like a garden sprayer. It's marketed for
tennis players to cool off by slinging it over their
shoulder. 

claims to cool the surrounding air 20*.

I pumped it up laid it on the dash of the bus and
wrapped the hose around the visor. It kept me cooooool
for a 45 minutes of feeway driving. You can control
the spray by rolling the driver's window up or
down--you want the mist to sort of churn around you. A
fan or fresh air blower would, of course, increase the
possiblities.

Downside: my right arm got a litte damp and I had to
pump it up once. But for $9?! And, of course, it's
basically a swamp cooler and won't work if there's
humidity in the air.

The package had a website listed: www.azmist_dot_com
