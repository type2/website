Subject: Fw: [T2]Push Rod Tubes Stuck, Help!

&gt;I'm in the process of changing some push rod seals on my '72 Westy with a
&gt;1800 (pancake). I have everything out but I can't seem to get the push rod
&gt;tubes to budge! I don't want to damage the tubes. Any tricks or secrects
&gt;you could pass along to me for getting them out (I'm a woman so pure
&gt;strength won't work!)

wiggling is the trick, and you may have to use some pliers to pinch them a little,
but they can be repaired if you find a socket that fits thru a good one, and tap it
thru the bent one with a ratchet extension.

 I'd rather not have to go out and purchase a special
&gt;tool for this either. I'd like to get this job done so I can enjoy the rest
&gt;of the weekend!

 there is no special tool for this job. use  small vise-grip pliers with curved jaws,
only tight enough to grip, twist, and pull . use a light touch of grease ( not sealant)
to lubricate the new seals. use viton seals ( wierd color of which i cannot even name )
they will leak a lot less for a lot longer.....

and so if you are cute and single, will you marry me ? (  i fall for women in greasy jeans ).
p. s. this is not a joke.....8^)
