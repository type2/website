Subject: Silicone Specialty Products, Silicone windshield wipers, lubricants and more

This site has a lot of possibilities with the different products they
manufacture, including specifications on the grades of the various silicone
based lubricants. They also carry a 5 year warranted windshield wiper blade
and several different membranes which I thought could be useful as gasket
material for some hard to obtain gaskets found on our aging buses. While I
don't have personal experience with any of the products it looked worth
passing on.

NOTE: I don't have a vested interest in this company. Just thought it looked
like they might have some cool products.
