&gt; &gt; Any time you stress one conponent more than it was designed for, there is
&gt; &gt; a danger.  In this case, the primary wire feeding the coil from the
&gt; &gt; ignition switch will carry more current.  Consider your ignition switch
&gt; &gt; before making the change
&gt;
&gt; How about using a nice big relay to switch the current just to the coil?

A good solution to the problem.  Disadvantages are increased complexity
and more possible failure modes.  However, if you are adapting components
to an existing design, this is probably the best solution
