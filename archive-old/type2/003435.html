&gt;Wow!!  back the hubcap dent up with some sand, and tap lightly around the

And jander14_at_wvu_dot_edu added:
&gt;I've been meaning to mention on this whole subject, this is basically a
&gt;&quot;shot bag&quot; an old metal worker/body mans trick.
&gt;Finding a genuine shot bag in an auction is another great thing but they
have more value than you &gt;might thing, I've given up bidding at about $40 on
a 12&quot;x12&quot; one around me being sold at an old &gt;body shops equipment auction.
I have sand in a purse.
