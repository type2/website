Subject: '61 23-Window Deluxe for Sale

1961 23-Window deluxe. Has some dents, has some rust, needs motor and
tranny. Located in Northern California. I've never actually seen it, I'm
trying to get some pix. I need another another bus like a hole in my head,
so I'm passing this one on to the masses. 

Jim (916) 222-6846 

He's asking $2500, but its very negotiable
