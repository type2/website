Subject: Re: [T2] Which dizzy - crazy shipping prices!

Thanks for the distributor info guys, and it looks like the best one to 
go for is just an OEM stock single vac advance, for example:

Unfortunately CBP want $75 to ship a distributor to the UK!!!...

and I thought they had decomissioned Concorde &lt;salutes&gt; ; )

How much do you reckon it really costs to ship something the size and 
weight of a distributor to the UK ? (I just received a whole Westy tent 
and that only cost $115 to send!)

wow
