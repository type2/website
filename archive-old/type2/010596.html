I am getting some good ideas about storing the engine out of the wrecked bus
but I also have a gas tank delima. When the wreck occurred the tank was
about two thirds full. It is likely that the bus will be off the road for
some time to come. Should I drain the tank somehow? Should I fill it up?
What to do. What to do.
