Subject: pulley wheel

There probably is a squeaky sound that comes along with it when your are 
running the engine.  There are a few kinds of pulley wheels available.
1.  some are the brazilian remakes which have a brassy color to them.  these 
are a no.

2.  then there are the steel ones which are ok also the old one we had on 
our bus.

3.  then there are steel ones which have a little piece of metal that sticks 
out on each side of the pulley wheel. (There are two sides, belt goes into 
the middle )  Those metal notches  on each side hook into the holes of the 
other pulley wheel.  Logically I think these are better because they attach 
to each other forming a tight connection and even rotation, while the other 
ones just sit next to one another and leave room for movement.  I don't 
remember how much we paid.  I think at least 20.  new fresh unbent shimmies 
are a good idea too. :)

i'd search the Junkyards.

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!

*I just replaced the pulley on my new 71 Westy. It seems to have too *much
*play. The replaced pulley fits a lot tighter. How much play is *acceptable?
*This is the first time that I replace one of this and maybe may *standards 
are
*too high. Any comments will be appreciated.
