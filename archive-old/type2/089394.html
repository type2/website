Subject: Re: [T2] Pop Top Fiasco/Etiquette

I'm going to second this, I have also had a great experience on my $200
order with busdepot. However, you should *always* write Ron first with a
problem. I'd hate to see busdepot lose business because of a few minor
problems when they probably fill numerous orders everyday.

I believe the saying in retail goes something like this: A customer with a
good transaction may tell one person, but a person with a bad transaction
tells everyone.

&gt; One thing I'll add is that I know Ron Salmon is one of our most helpful
folks here, and he appreciates any of us taking a beef to him for some
direct resolution before we have newer folks like the poster earlier with a
wavering 400 dollar order going somewhere else over one person's greivance.
