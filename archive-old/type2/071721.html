As far as I know these are the only new heads available (especially
for a 76-78 bay). They are warranteed plus with proper CR ing I think
seat problems can be eliminated.  Did Mark Stephens ever actually
deliver a 100,000 mile head?  I don't think so.

I think virgin heads with no welds and cracks are better than the
rebuilt alternative.  My experience has been that the cracks cause
the seats to fail.  New metal to me seems better than twenty year old
brittle and cracked alloy.

Bring the CR down to around 7 and make sure your mixture is not to
lean (be very carefully of vacumn leaks) and these heads should do
just fine.


Time will tell

&gt;FWIW, these heads used to have a terrible reputation for losing their
&gt;seats.  This is what gave the infamous Mark Stephenson his idea for
the &quot;100,000 mile seat&quot;.
