&gt; &gt;According to my English T2 manual, 1600 engines were available as an option

&gt; According to the literature I've seen the 1600cc was standard 
&gt; and the Type 4 was optional (extra cost).

Yes.  Even weirder: the pick-up models weren't available with 
the Type 4 even optionally in Germany.  In the Netherlands,
they were.  Odd, that.
