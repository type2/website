Subject: fuel line cont'd

List:

Replacing fuel lines last night.

#4 injector, while pushing new hose on, I sheared off the stud that comes out of the intake runner to mount the individual injector on. I have the runner of, and I think I can easy out the stud.

Can anyone size this stud for me to replace? 

Who has bosch injector seals?

Thanks to all who've helped on this thread. The job's going well otherwise. I plan to write a comprehensive T4 injected fuel line replacement entry for the library, as there isn't one yet.

Do I submit to admin. for that?

Billy
