&gt; Even the so-called &quot;fuel injection&quot; rated hose available
&gt;at most parts shops is very poor when compared to the original or the german

&gt;it is 7mm inside and will not deteriorate in the engine bay the way the
&gt;american stuff will certainly do.

Plus BB is cheaper than the MB dealer. When is BB going to change the webpage to NOT say &quot;12 to 15 feet usually does the engine compartment, supply lines and return lines, depending on the year&quot;?

4 feet is more like it.

&gt;Be careful also with which clamps you use,
&gt;the VW dealer has good ones, as does the Mercededs dealer. The stock ones
&gt;are the best, if they are still useable.

At the bottom of my webpage are part numbers for all of these items.

Hose clamps are pretty expensive if you get them for VW or MB and you need a lot of them. Use the originals or get FI hose clamps by the box from the flaps.

I prefer clamps without the phillips head. See mini clamps on this page:
