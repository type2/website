Volk, 

Sean wrote me privately about a shifter rattle that was driving him
bonkers.  I am posting my response, because I I have the same problem and
would love to hear a solution.  My take on the problem is that it is a
combination of factors, worn bushings, wear in the trans, and the ball and
cup getting worn over time.  Replacing the &quot;shuttlecock&quot; guide bushings
on the shifter rod would help, if anyone made them.  Replacing the shift
coupler does help, but is only one step in the process, and it seems a bit
extreme to rebuild the trans for an annoyance.

Sean,

The shifter in the '73 rattles as well, and I don't know what the solution
is.  filling the cup with grease lasts about a week.  I think the real
problem is just age and wear.  The cure is to dig up a NOS shifter and
&quot;peace pipe&quot; (my name for the forward section of the shift rod).  Since
that isn't really possible, I have wondered if getting a roll of teflon
tape and wrapping the bejeesus out of the ball might not help a bit.  The
other (non-classy) solutions are that I have found that pushing the shift
a *hair* out of gear will quiet things for a couple of minutes so I can
get my sanity back or that it may just be bungie time :-)
