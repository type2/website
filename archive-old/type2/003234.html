Subject: Re: [T2] no red light on

Paul,

Are you saying that the red light doesn't come on when you turn the key to
the first position?  Do you have the Idiot book?  Muir has a nice write-up
on how to troubleshoot your charging system.  I'd start there, but pay
careful attention to all the electrical connections.  Make sure that they're
clean and tight.   It can't hurt, the price is right (some time and elbow
grease) and you may get lucky and find the problem before you start
replacing parts.

Good luck.
