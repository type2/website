&lt;&lt; Anybody else on this list have any

experiences with bra's of the vehicle variety damaging paint? &gt;&gt;

Oh yeah...Guy down the street from me had one on his 260 Z for 
about a year. When he finally went to take it off, the 'flocking'
or whatever was on the back of the vinyl was still on the car...
Ouch! Another thing to remember about bras...The paint on your
Bus is slowly changing color from the Sun, etc. but the area under 
the bra isn't...
