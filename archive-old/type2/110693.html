&gt; timing the engine with 009 and 34 Pict 3 carb. 

look in the type2 library for an easy way to setup your pict 3:

&gt; I thought I should check and adjust 

yes checking &amp; adjusting the timing should be a regular ordeal. If you
stick with the 009 time it like here:
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electrip/bosch009.htm

&amp; be sure you time it before setting the carb.

&gt; Do I really need to get knee deep in this carb buisiness when 
&gt; setting the timing or am I getting the wrong message from the article?

it's up to you. I would just set the timing &amp; adjust the carb for now.
when you feel a bit more comfortable about the bus then start working
on the jets and such.

&gt; Another question I've been wanting to throw out there and I'm sure it's been 
&gt; beat into the ground (but I wasn't there for those beatings) is to thermostat 
&gt; or not to thermostat? My local flaps guy asked me &quot;why would I want one&quot; and 
&gt; said that they were notorious for erupting and somehow making the flaps stay 
&gt; closed. 

do what you want here, but keep this in mind it has been observed that
in the type IV engine the flaps actually help direct some of the air
in the proper places so it serves a function in addition to temp
control. It also helps the engine reach operating temperature as
quickly as possible &amp; helps maintain that temp. How can that be bad?

Oh, one other thing. THERMOSTAT FLAPS DO NOT FAIL IN THE CLOSED
POSITION. Except for the possible binding of pivots that would cause
it to fail closed it is designed to fail in the open position. Think
about it. the little thermostat gets longer when heated right? Well
since it's not pulling a cable when heated it must be releasing a
cable right. What causes the flaps to actually open? A spring provides
the tension needed to open the flaps &amp; the t-stat works against this
spring. so if the t-stat breaks it will fail in the &quot;hot&quot; state which
is fully expanded. This just means that the flaps will always remain
open because of the spring tension.
