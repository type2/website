Thanks,

Donald Gibbons  you guessed it  the clutch on my 2L had a couple of bolts 
that protruded about 1/4 in too far and were rubbing against the clutch 
housing I pulled the engine out and saw where it was rubbing.  I switched 
the pressure plate and clutch from the 1800 that came out of the bus and 
it's a very good now. I just hope I lined everything up right. Sometimes 
Muir confuses the hell out of me.

This seems wierd since I thought this bus originally had a 2L in it&gt;

Thanks much

Mickey
