Subject: Propane heaters, suggestion.

I've been following the discussion about propane heaters and was wondering
if anyone had heard of Olympian? They make two models I know of, the 3100A
Catalytic and the 6100A. The 3100A is adjustable from 1600 to 2800 BTU's,
is completely safe, needs absolutely NO venting (no holes to cut :)) and is
cheap, about 250$, and can be used vertically or horizontally. The brochure
says it warms up to 110 square feet. Uses something like 1/4 lb or propane
per hour of use. I think I remember figuring out that it could be run for
something like 18 straight hours on my stock propane tank.

The 6100A has from 3200 to 5800 BTU's, and can be recessed into a cabinet
etc... Its about 350$. This one has an electric start, the 3100 has a piezo
start.

If anyone wants anymore info on these let me know. I'm probably going to go
for the 3100A, it's small, completely safe, and needs no venting since it
works on a catalytic process.
