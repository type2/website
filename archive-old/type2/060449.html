Subject: Camping for FL shows this weekend

I just got off the phone with Hillsborough River State Park
(813/987-6771) and they said there are still plenty of sites for this
weekend, plus the gate is open until 10PM.

If you're headed for the shows, this is a more natural alternative than
the &quot;show campground&quot;, and only 10 minutes further away -- I'll be
rolling in around dark this evening.  Look for a blue Honda Prelude.

(Yeah, no VW and no westy tent this weekend.  I'm in a transitional
period.)

Hope to see y'all at the show(s)

joe
