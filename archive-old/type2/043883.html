Subject: [T2] re: 1970 Bus paint

The new VW trends mag (sept. 2000) has a section with all the colors they
used along with the paint codes.  In '69 they used 'toga white L90C' not
sure if this was used on'70 models, but they do have a 'pastel white L90D'
that was used from '70-'73.  Hope this helps.

Happy Busing,
