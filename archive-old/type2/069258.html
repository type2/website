Subject: aircleaner esoterica?

Hi all - was goofin' some more with aircleaners today... pulled out my
spare can and found that they are two different makes &amp; models! The one
that came with my motor is a Knecht; stamped &quot;LB 662/1 504M1&quot; on the top
part, &quot;Knecht 211 129 613 H  &quot;   and  &quot; LB 662/3&quot; on the bottom. The can
I've been using is by Mann, stamped &quot; 37  028  58  211&quot; on the top; &quot; 37
028 85 271&quot; and  &quot;211 129 607C &quot; on the bottom. The Mann has a
thermostatically controlled flapper, and the vent on the oilfiller tube
connects via hose to a fitting on the top part of the cleaner. There is
also a small fitting on the intake pipe (which I assume to be for
preheat?), as well as a BIG opening w/ a flap on the bottom of the intake
which I assume to be for an attachment to the muffler. Which I don't use,
having a Monza.  The Knecht lacks the thermostat and the fitting on the
top. I assume we have an earlier and a later model; does anyone (Clara? ;&gt;)
know which is which... and where some hoses might be better placed! BTW, I
would assume there is at least one fitting for the airfilter cannister to
attach to, except the '70 never had one!
