Subject: Re: Starter Selenoid (high/low)

Lorraine Rios sends:

&gt; I was wondering if anyone could explain the high/low side of a Starter
&gt; Selenoid.  Meaning...There's the main feed (batt Pos, then two sides to
&gt; attach other wires too. Ignition, etc.  I don't see any visual designation
&gt; to one or the other, but read about the high/low side...How do I know which
&gt; side to attach the Black/Red wire to?
&gt; Probably a dumb question, but I had to ask...

No, this isn't a dumb question, especially if you're trying to get the thing
to work.

Hold the solenoid with the terminals facing you and the push-on prong (or
prongs--sometimes there are more than one) up. The bolt to the left takes
the wire from the battery, the bolt to the right takes the wire to the
starter motor (you could put it on either bolt, because this part of a
starter solenoid is really just a switch and switches don't care how they're
wired, but the wire off the starter motor is about an inch long and won't
reach the other side) and the push-on goes to the keyswitch wire.

If you have more than one prong, this is a fuel injection starter. The FI
system needs to know when the starter's running, and this extra prong is
what tells it. My Bug had an FI starter on it (and a carb) and it didn't
care which prong I used for the key.
