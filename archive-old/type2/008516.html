Subject: Front end (?) Noise Answer

Survey says: Bearings.

The Collective Wisdom of the Wizards of Busaciousness was right-on again.

Thanks for the help and advice. I couldn't have gotten as far with Vandela
as I have without you. 

The inside bearing on the left front wheel had headed south. We've replaced
both the inside and outside bearings and life is good again. The right side
is fine, but when it goes, I'm going to try doing the fix myself. Aw heck,
there goes my manicure. :)

See you all at Corona de Tucson at the end of the month.
