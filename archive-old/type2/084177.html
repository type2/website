That is a plastic tee you are looking at with cloth covered hose as the 
connectors. The &quot;third side&quot; loops back to acharcoal canister near the 
battery. The canister should two large hoses coming off it also.

&gt;I think that very first picture points out what I am missing, and I &quot;think&quot;
&gt;it is just that little
&gt;fabric 3 way connector thingy seen here :

&gt;
&gt;What I am not sure of is what that third thing connects to. The one coming
&gt;from the left meets up with the one coming in from the right, but then it
&gt;connects to something else going back towards the gas tank, or airbox, I
&gt;can't really tell.
&gt;
&gt;Do you have a picture showing that specific connection, or more importantly
&gt;where that third thing connects to?

&gt;The url above shows that same picture as you have I think, just without
&gt;anything properly connected.

&gt;&gt;Christopher,
&gt;&gt;I went and took some pics of my engine bay and posted them on my
&gt;&gt;site.  Check them out here.  www.wicals_dot_com/troy/vw/enginebay/index.htm
&gt;&gt;I did not compress these images as to hopefully give you as much detail
&gt;&gt;as possible.  I just replaced all my vaccum lines recently as well as
&gt;&gt;the throttle body gasket and it did a world of help.  I would highly
&gt;&gt;recommend this be done if your lines look worn.  Also look at the fuel
&gt;&gt;lines.  Let me know if you need different angles or more pics.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Good luck
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;fellow listmembers......
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have been working on finding all of the &quot;this isn't connected to
&gt;&gt;anything&quot;
&gt;&gt;type stuff
&gt;&gt;and putting it all back together regardless of how important it seems,
&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;still working
&gt;&gt;on these tubes that come out of the fuel system someplace, I believe to
&gt;&gt;help
&gt;&gt;it breathe.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The top right hand side of my charcoal canister, there is a thin little
&gt;&gt;tube
&gt;&gt;that goes noplace
&gt;&gt;currently, and I think that is part of this same system.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Here is a pic of what I do have now, I think I am definetly missing some
&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;those items.
&gt;&gt;Could you take a look at this and see what I'll need to get this put
&gt;&gt;back
&gt;&gt;together correctly?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just not sure what I need to order, or if I can get what I need at a
&gt;&gt;hardware store/flaps to fix this?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;thanks for any tips, info, tomfoolery you can shed on the subject...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Christopher
