Subject: camp stool

That was quite the nice gesture, Chris. If anyone EVER has a camp stool
(console) they care to part with, PLEASE keep me in mind.  I have searched
for one of these since fall, 1993 when (at busses by the arch campout) I
realized my westy was missing this handy piece.
I am willing to pay a fair price if anyone knows the whereabouts of one.
This has topped my Christmas list for years.
Jay
&quot;Yes that is a handsome, new-in-original-box, barndoor ambulance fan, but I
don't need one.  What I really want is a late bay camp stool. &quot;




&gt;In the spirit of reciprocity, I have the center console (between the two
&gt;front seats) from my 78 Deluxe Pop Top boxed (in near new condition with
&gt;factory brown and beige plaid upholstery) and doing nothing. It is free
&gt;(you pay shipping) to anyone who would enjoy it.
