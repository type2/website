Having a good Friday?

So I ended up buying the 69 Westfalia I looked at.   Kind of bunged up here
and there, but with some time, money, and love, I'll make it all right.
Anyway, most of the parts that I need I've been able to locate online.
There's just one problem.   The previous owner hit a dog and smashed in the
front panel of the bus, around and under the right front headlight
assembly.   The damage is enough to make me want to see if I can find a
front skin for the bus.  Also, there was some rust underneath the
windshield which the owner fixed with bondo, so best case scenario would be
to replace the entire front piece.   I'd like a close to perfect appearance
for the bus...


I guess since they don't make that part per se, I'll have to cut the entire
front of a junker (or maybe a really good body shop would be able to fix
both of these problems).   Can anyone recommend a good parts yard where I
could find something like this (I live in Costa Mesa, SoCal), or maybe a
good bodyshop that is sensitive to the needs of older buses?

Thanks.

Jason
