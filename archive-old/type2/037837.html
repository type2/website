Subject: Removable Poptop Canvas? Any ideas???

All,

It's getting to be time for me to finally install the
replacement canvas I bought for my '69 Westy two years
ago and I had a few ideas that I want input on...

First...Has anyone been able to figure out a way to
make the canvas removable without having to go through
the whole operation all over again? I'm only
considering this because I need to paint my bus
sometime in the (near, I hope) future. I think I know
the answer to this one, but it never hurts to ask!


Second...My poptop's hinges are fairly worn and I'm
wondering about the best way to go about fixing them.
Specifically, the bolt that forms the axis has
'ovel-ized' the holes in the support tubes and causes
a fair amount of play. I could simply put a larger
diameter bolt in there, and that would cure it
temporarily, but I want something a little more
permanent and stronger as well.

One thought was to drill the holes out a bit and find
some metal tubing that would fit snugly inside (of the
holes I just drilled-out) and thread the ends so I can
attach a nut on each side. I could then run a new
bolt/washer through these 'tubes' and tighten them
more than I can now. This would pretty much guarantee
that no further damage would be done, but I wonder if
drilling larger holes will affect the
strength/integrity of the support tubes? I suppose I
could have the pieces welded in (as opposed to
threading the ends for nuts), but welding galvanized
tubing seems a little sketchy... Any ideas???


And last....When my poptop is down and secured, there
is a difference in height between it and the luggage
rack. The poptop is noticeably lower...by about 1/2 an
inch. Is this proper? Is the poptop supposed to rest
on something (like a rubber donut)? And yes, I do have
a new seal on there, so that's not the culprit. Could
it just be the play in the hinges allowing the top to
push forward from the tension of both the hold down
straps and the seal pushing against the luggage rack?


Any ideas would be greatly appreciated, as I have a
week off soon, and I want to get all of this done. Any
'been-there-done-that' advice on the canvas install???


Also, I will document/photo *every* step of this and
put it on my site....I don't think poptops_dot_com &lt;
http://www.poptops_dot_com/  &gt; did all that great of a job
in showing how it's done. Still, they're better than
nothing ;-)
