Subject: Lug wrench size and other questions
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am still fixing/replacing lots of little items on my new '80 Westfalia.
One very crucial item I need is a lug wrench.  Apparently the PO had a
wrench which doesn't fit!  None of my sockets are large enough to fit the
nuts, so assuming all are stock (scary thought if they aren't) size, which
size wrench do I need?

I'm really getting to know this vehicle well.  I pulled the starter/solenoid
yesterday in no time and realized that the heater flaps are right there.
They need to be adjusted as some hot air gets through the vents now.  I also
need to bleed the slave cylinder.  No questions here yet, just having a good
time tinkering.  Some VW engineering seems brilliant and other stuff
strangely illogical.  In particular, the wiring connectors seem cheap and
prone to failure.  OK, I do have questions.

What is a good source for shiny, new, built-to-last push-on electrical
connectors.  Once on, what is the best way to insure that they stay
efficient conductors of electricity?  I'm familiar with heat shrink tubing
from Radio Schlock, but hate to do business there.

I noticed that my gas lines near the filter and pump are getting near their
lifespan.  What advice/wisdom can people offer on type and size hose to use?

Finally, how can I post a response to a thread?  I've tried the web
interface (FindMail) but got very frustrated after 2 attempts to use my
password failed.  The page keeps asking for my password after I type it in
(tried 3 times in a row).  I have my browser set to deny cookies, could this
be it?  There must? be a way to respond to a thread via the list server
daemon, but I don't know how.  Is FindMail the only way?

Thanks,

John Haddad
