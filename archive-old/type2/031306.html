. safety, those larger lights are easier to see for the next person trying
not to hit your new rear end
. legal, non standard item that _MAY_ not be legal for that year vehicle.
remember your van has to meet the standards for the year built, not sure
what they were when but I'm sure VW had a reason for that improvement.
depending on your state it may or may not effect you, but it could be a
problem for the next owner when he tries to register it.
. wiring, not sure what the differences are but I believe the wiring may
be different
