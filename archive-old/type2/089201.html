Subject: Re: [T2] Cold Idle Issues

&gt;  I have a dizzy from a 70 manual (113 905 205T) on an unknown dual port
engine.  I'll have to recheck, but I thought I culled the 7.5 ATDC from the
chart in Bentley.  If someone has it available I'd be curious what it says.

The timing specs I listed were straight out of the 68-79 Bentley.
The 113T is a vacuum only dizzy, 69-70, that times at 0 at idle with the hose
disconnected.
This is the same timing spec that is listed in Bentley for 68-70 buses.
7.5 after is too retarded!
