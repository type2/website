Subject: RE: mesquito net

Hey

Thanks to eveyone who graciously offered me a net. I have decided to accept
Karl von Salzen's offer for one for cheap. He has given me 2 other things
for free and I am truly awed by him.

In an effort to keep the good karma going I am offering a sink top for the
68-71 Westy I believe. It is the one with the graph pattern on it. It is
very nice and clean. I am going to give it away but please only take it if
you really need it.

I apreciate it!
