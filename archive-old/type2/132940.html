&gt; Not my beetle jack!  The beetle jack I had was a design that walks a
&gt; couple of cams up a thick-wall tube.  _This_ was a horrible design as it
&gt; was prone to slippage.  I carry a bus jack in my bug for that reason! &gt;


Of course, my bus jack is the same design as your beetle jack.  Must have
been a 67&gt;68 change with everything else that changed then.  The bus jack
for my '69 (must be stuffed somewhere..) was gear driven.
