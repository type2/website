&gt;This sounds like you don't have the rear shoes adjusted correctly.

I agree with Karl.  You can simulate tightening your rear brakes without
actually doing it, to test.  What you do is to set the emergency brake,
then release it a notch at a time until it *just* lets go, then release it
one more notch.  My guess is that your e-brake handle will still be out
pretty far at this point.  Now drive around and see how firm the pedal is
and how much better your bus stops.  Once you are convinced that there is
an improvement, release your e-brake and adjust the rear drums.

Since the rears are not auto-adjusting (at least not in '73) the rears will
loosen up over a period of months.  I am typically lazy about adjusting
them and start leaving my e-brake out a few notches when they get loose to
keep braking performance up to par.  When my e-brake handle starts getting
way out I know it's time to get under the bus and adjust the darned brakes.
