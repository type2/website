Subject: Re: [T2] vasoline and rubber hoses

the stuff i have used in the past was in a spray can.  it was so old that
it said JC Penney and was made for JC Penney when they still did auto
service at their stores.  i think that my brother still has half that can
left.  that certainly doesn't help anyone find it though i need some too
as i have a master cylinder sitting on the shelf that needs a rebuild.  i
think the main problem is that in general amercians don't rebuild brake
components any more.

i just asked about rebuilding my brake master cylinder on the vanagon list
and it was little short of me being flammed for even considering it.  i
would say that unless you have one of those really old school auto parts
places with a old guy behind the counter that you will have to go to your
local brake rebuilder and find their source or buy from them. i checked
napa's website and came up empty and wurths usa site is down for
construction.

this pelican parts website says that they are using a napa lube by the
name of Sil-Glide but i can read the part number in the picture and a
search of napa's site with the name doesn't yield anything.  after some
more searching i found this company that sells to dealers selling it.

here is another company selling a silicone lube that is supposed to be for
brakes.
