&gt; &lt;&lt; Is it possible to import one of them to the USA?? Do imported trailers go

I don't know.  Having said that, and speaking from a platform of absolute
ignorance (you have been warned :-), I would say that the only limit I can
think of in the vehicle regs would be on the tail light lenses.  There is
a DOT spec on them and to be legal, lenses must have a registration number
cast into the lens.  If you had brakes, then there would be standards to
be met there too, but I doubt that the puck line is heavy enough to
have/need brakes.

&gt; btw, I was wrong earlier about the eriba_dot_de address, as it appears that Eriba 
&gt; is located in the Netherlands, so try www.eriba.nl

www.eriba.nl &amp; _dot_de turn up sites;
www.eriba.co_dot_uk and www.eriba.fr turn up regitered names, no site;
www.eriba.es, .be, and .it are not registered.

&gt; I have no idea if you can import one of these.  They are not cheap.  I've 
&gt; heard the old ones going for as high as $5000, which is about the same price 
&gt; as a new one.

I have always been tempted, but never $5K worth, which seems to be about
the going rate (yeah, yeah, I know they have gone for less, but that seems
to be the going rate for an informed transaction in decent condition.)
further information woudl be welcome tho!!!
