Subject: wisdom + opinions needed please! 72 vs 78 westy

Hi there
I am a list neophyte and confirmed wannabusser in the Pacific NW. I've 
been looking for about 2 months and have currently narrowed the field 
down to two: a 72 westy and 78 deluxe westy. I've searched and read the 
type2 archvices but still am in need of some expert advice at this 
point! Here are the details:
72 -- ~`190K major engine rebuild (2L) 45K ago - owner did rebuild and 
went to single solex. Needs new muffler and clutch. Comes with 
reconditioned heater boxes. Interior and paint in excellent shape, small 
rust spot over battery case. yellow/orange -- my favorite type2 color. 
Owner asking $2400. 

78 -- 204K -- taken to bare metal and repainted by owner this spring. 
dark blue. Interior worn but working. has sink/fridge/stove and aux 
propane heater under the dash (?)
HAd compression checked: 105/100/110/105 which is good for 204K miles 
with no rebuild but (I think) means I'd need a rebuild asap. It also 
needs: lower ball joints, CV joints, master brake cylinder. Owner has 
come down in price and is asking $2500. With rebuild and suspension 
fixes I am still looking at $6000 invested (which is ton of money for 
me).
The 72 is my sentimental favorite because I like the bright interior and 
paint but that's the kid in me. I also like the fact it still has all 
the little orginal westy touches. I am worried about the carbueration 
(vs. FI) and valve adjustments (vs
Hydraulic). I can do the wrenching but am busier than I used to be :) I 
am also  worried about a money pit in the 72. The price is right -- I 
can afford 3K to get it on the road and I like the vibe this little bus 
has.
The 78 is much more functional -- I like the bigger top area to sleep in 
and it has a rack on top of it for surfboards, kayaks, etc. The owner 
has come way downon the price and I don't want to pass up a good deal. 
The overall investment(~`6K) would be a much bigger stretch for me 
though.


So -- what am I missing? What other issues are there around these two 
model years? Both are high miles. The 78 has spent more time on the west 
coast and presumably has less undercarriage rust (?. 
I need help from someone that knows more about buses than I do -- any
advice/wisdom/comments/ etc. are appreciated. Maybe I need to just 
keeplooking..

thanks. Jamie

ps. another silly point - -the driver's seat in the 78 seems to be 
&quot;higher&quot; than the '72 -- when I turn my heard I feel like I am looking 
at the top of the door instead of out the window -- why? is there 
anything I can do about it? I like the ergs of the 72 better mostly on 
that basis :)
