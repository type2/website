Subject: [T2] Central idling system

I just read all the PDSIT stuff in the Library and now my head hurts. :-)

How come I don't have two solenoids on my left carb? The pictures in the
Bentley show two, and I've only got one, I swear.

Open your missals (aka Bentley) to Fuel System, p. 22 for the exploded view
of the PDSIT. I've got #3, Central idling system electromagnetic cutoff
valve, but do not have #29, Electromagnetic idling cutoff valve.

On the old carb (which I have right here) there is in that place what looks
like a jet with a BB jammed in it (&quot;0(8?)55 Solex&quot; -- the slot's kinda
mangled, so it's hard to read that first number). I just looked at the
&quot;new&quot; carb, and it's got something similar in that spot, too. What gives?
