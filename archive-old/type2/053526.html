&gt; RMMW sells an &quot;end play tool&quot; for $28.50. I'm wondering if this tool works

&gt; catalog I'm looking at now. I thought it was much cheaper. Has any one used
&gt; this tool? Or would it be cheaper to get a dial gauge?

I was told those &quot;end play&quot; tools are all but useless...
&gt;from harborfreight you can get the dial gague and the mounting bars for
less than that, and you can use it for other stuff too...
(setting front bearing play, measuring valve guide wear, etc. etc.)

take care,

Steve
