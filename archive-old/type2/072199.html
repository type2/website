Subject: battery relays, etc

I saw some interesting info in the archives regarding installing isolators
and 2nd batteries but I'm looking for info on how to run all circuits from
your 2nd battery when parked.  As I understand it, the 2nd battery (in the
case of my 79 westy) only supplies the fridge.

I'm not concerned about running the fridge on that circuit, bit I'd like to
run lights, water pump, radio, etc saving the other battery for start-up.
