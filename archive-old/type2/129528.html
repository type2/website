Subject: Re: [T2] Throttle Positioner sought

What I got here is a brand spanking new Kafer 34 PICT-3 from 
Aircooled_dot_net. Details at

http://tinyurl_dot_com/65mfs

I don't have a mounting bracket or pull arm. Might need to find all 
those darn parts.

Just got off the phone with Bob In Leucadia and he was advising me that 
finding a positioner for this carb might require some hunting.

&gt;  Do you still have the original German duel arm carb on it? Also are the mounting bracket and the pull arm still there? 
&gt;If yes to all of these questions, I more then likely have some good used ones. If you have the Borosol K Cal duel arm 
&gt;carb they have a plastic pull off, if you have the original German Solex, it will have a meta one.

&gt;&gt;Okay, here's something neither bustedbus_dot_com nor Bus Depot have listed. 
&gt;&gt;Throttle Positioner for 1971 bus. It's part of the original emissions 
&gt;&gt;control and I want the Wonderbus to pollute as little as it did when 
&gt;&gt;sold new.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If it makes a difference, the carb is a 34 PICT-3
