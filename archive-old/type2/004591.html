Here is the phone number for the people that bought out Mark Stephens (or
ended up with his stuff), also a couple of his X employees work there (I was
told/rumored). From what I understand (heard/rumors) is that this is where a
lot of the parts went. Hope this helps.
661   726-9915  or  661  726-0151

Subject: [T2] Mark Stephens Update: Bad News


LIST:

Here's part of a letter I got from someone who was chasing down my engine
that was &quot;stuck&quot; out at MSHP.  I had over $3000 in this motor and thought
others would like to know how this #$&amp;%^* story turned out:

&quot;Bad News...Everyone skipped town...with all the engines...yours...mine...
&gt;Mark owed me $8,000 and swore he would pay me off with a hot T4 engine.
&gt;Norm left the state overnight for the midwest. Mark had his house forclosed
&gt;on and vanished. No forwarding phone or address!
&gt;
&gt;Sorry...but we have been taken.  The moral is...don't let things go on and
&gt;on...collect what's owed you ASAP.&quot;

Caveat Emptor...
