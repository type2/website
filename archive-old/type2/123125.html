&gt; well this engine actually came out of a 411? is it?
&gt; and its fuel injected.........now im new to
&gt; volkswagens and the 68 van i have didnt have an
&gt; engine. I found another one just like for parts for
&gt; cheap and inside it...sitting inside it is this
&gt; engine.......so i was wondering if it would work in
&gt; it......

it will not work in a 68 without a lot of work as there is no rear engine
mount for it.

&gt; so im just not that familiar with what goes with what
&gt; yet.......Also would this engine fit in a newer bus
&gt; say..........a 76 or so?

I put a 71 411 engine in my 78, BUT I used the 78 bus fuel injection
system including the intake runners
