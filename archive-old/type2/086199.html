Subject: 71-79 Wheels FS

Hi Folks,

A friend of mine just got a new set of wheels, and he's offering his old set 
to The List first, before trying his luck on Eb*y.  So, here's the deal:

5 Wheels, fit 71-79 Buses (narrow 5 pattern).  Straight, rust-free, 
currently painted black.  Wheels ran great when removed from Bus last week.  
$50 O.B.O. for all 5, buyer pays shipping from Aspen, Colorado or picks up.

Contact mmcquilton_at_silvertreehotel_dot_com for more info or to make an offer.

Take care one and all,
Jason Upper
