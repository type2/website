Subject: I need help!

So, a few days ago I got my egr and the valve and stuff all cleaned out
and hooked up.  Tested and it drops the idle speed when the valve is
opened.  I also swapped in my 78 FI into my 76 engine and all the
associated parts (afm, harness).

Now, I get the following smog results:

at 15mph, 2151rpms
my CO is 0.06 (max 1.66)
NO is 2013 (max 1534) &lt;-- that's where it failed

at 25mph, 2031rpms
my CO is 0.15 (max 1.46)
NO is 394 (max 1394)


How can I bring that down?  The CO is really low now, so does that mean
that it's running really lean?  Plus, it's way under on the NO test for
the higher 25mph range.

should I richen the mixture a bit?  Does anyone know how much CO
increase will give a corresponding NO decrease.. as in, will raising the
CO 1% bring the NO down by 600 ppm or more??

oh, one other thing, this is in CA on a dyno smog tester... 

Thanks,
Mike
