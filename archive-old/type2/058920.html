Thanks to all that responded ... the general concensus is that I should
check my timing and points.  I am obviously new at this, but would bad
timing or points come on suddenly like that ... 2 days before I drove the
same route to the camping spot w/o any problems at all ... and the white
smoke coming out of the oil breather worries me is that a result of getting
too hot on account of the timing???  I have the bently and muir books and am
anxious to dig into the timing/points ... am I going to be able to tell if
the points are shot w/o taking them out???  I will dig into the archives
also, but any advice for the newbie would be appreciated.

Mike
