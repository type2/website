So I wrote:
Well mon, it could be a couple of things. Definitely tune-up everything
before you get too far here. Mistimed engine could do this. Missing
ignition in 1-more cylinders could do this too. Outrageously bad fuel mixture
maybe? My distributor was recently gunked up  making my timing very flaky and 
prone to change 10-15 degrees whenever the nearest bird chirped. Cleaning
moving parts in distributor stopped my most recent round of stalling at
startup.

Then check out the auxillary air valve. It's a little doohickey mounted
on top of the crankcase, just forward of and to the passenger side of the 
crankcase ventilator tower. It's got an electrical connection, and two
1/2&quot; dia. hoses attached to it. It's always a pain to get this in and out
because access is hard and you'll probably drop screws and washers (use a 
magnet!), but take it out and check it out like John Muir says. This thing
is supposed to pass some extra air (and therefore fuel) when you're warming up,
kind of like a choke. When it warms up, the valve slowly closes. 

My 78 bus did about what you describe when I got it. Replacing that thing
fixed it. Funny thing was, the old one checked out per John Muir's procedure,
so what the hey. New one cost me about $45 from FLAPS 3 years ago.

&gt;From your description, the cold start injector is probably fine, maybe even 
hyperactive. If none of the above fixes problem, look to this next.

Be methodical. It may seem like gremlins at first, but you'll get it if you fix
one thing at a time and keep at it.
Good luck,
Surfer Bob
