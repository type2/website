The Porsche alloys are 5 lug and are very close, but I was told they are
slightly off and would not work on a bus without modifications.

&gt; I think they would work with bus wheels. If I remember correctly, they are
5-bolt, too. And I think that I have seen Porsche alloys on buses before.
&gt; List, am I right or way off?
