Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Exchanger Quality

&lt;&lt; the Chicago owner had covered the HEs with a kind of asbestos
blanketing.&gt;&gt;

 Obviously a brilliant man---


&gt;&gt; Seemed a great concept,&gt;&gt;

Dynamic concept.

&lt;&lt; except (human safety considerations apart)&gt;&gt;

There still are millions of buildings world wide , that still have
asbestos lined pipes.

I wouldn't really worry about it.


&lt;&lt; the asbestos absorbed the water loaded with road salt, and the HEs
were toast, to say it with a bit of humor ;-))&gt;&gt;

Absolutely fried I bet--Par boiled if you like Glenn---

If the lining had been painted or sealed the exchanger's wouldn't have
been so toasty

There still is available a safe to use exhaust wrap that would do all of
the above.--and if you don't reside in the Windy where calcium chloride
is a problem in the winter ( lets say South Dakota for instance ) the
heat retention using some sort of exhaust wrap over the exchanger's
would be beneficial for ultimate heat distribution up inside the Bus.


Watch out for the wild men in Chicago with neat idea's-- ~: )
It's contagious.
