&gt;What we call &quot;vacuum advance&quot; distributors are't really advancing with

Not correct as I understand it.  I was guilty at one time of believing the 
above but Karl convinced me otherwise.  Here is the truth:

1.  Manifold vacuum is the ultimate source of vacuum advance. **
2.  Vacuum created by the venturi effect has no significant effect on 
vacuum advance.
3.  At WOT (wide open throttle), measured vacuum advance *and* manifold 
vacuum will both go to ZERO.

Take a carb apart sometime and look, get a vacuum gauge and test, you will 
see it's true.

** At slight throttle openings, manifold vacuum is &quot;transferred&quot; to the 
vacuum advance port, the source of which is *just* above the throttle 
plate, not in the &quot;carburator proper&quot;.
