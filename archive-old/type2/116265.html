Subject: She doesn't want to go camping?!

Ok....
 
    Now, the WHOLE REASON why I bought the Volkswagen Transporter was
because she likes Volkswagens and think the Bus is cute. She likes it SOO
much that she even gave it a name! (She calls it &quot;Skipper&quot; or &quot;Skippy&quot; for
short.. haha)
Anyway, I wanted to plan a camping trip in the keys this winter (about a 3
hour trip from Fort Lauderdale). BUT.. as it would turn out.. she says she
hates camping (she's never gone). She says that she refuses to sleep in the
Bus and she only wants to use it to take to the beach.
 
So... with that in mind... short of getting a new future wife, is there any
way to convince the SO to go on a camping trip. EVEN if it's just for one
day? Anyone had any experience with that? Hell.. I'd have no problems
sleeping in the Bus. I'd do it for a month if I needed to.
