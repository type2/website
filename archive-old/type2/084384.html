Subject: Re: [T2] ??? Mystery Distributor

Eron,

It's a strange coincidence that you should post this on Monday. 
Yesterday I pulled one of these distributors out of my '69 bug project
(knowing that it will be a long while before it's ready to run) to try
in my bus, a '73 panel that a PO swapped in a Type 1 engine for the Type
IV. It had a 009 that I put in last year under misguided advice.

I wasn't sure what this dizzy was and I didn't take the time to try to
look it up.  I only knew that it was a vacuum advance when I pulled it. 
I disassembled it to clean and lube and that's when I found it was a
dual advance.  I've got a SVDA on order from John Connolly, but he is
back ordered on rebuilt cores to use.  So I figured that I'd give this a
try in the mean time.

The engine is a single port 1500 block (I have no idea if it's stock
displacement) with a 30 PIC 3 carb.  I set the dizzy up with .016 point
gap and idle / static timing at 7.5 degree advance.  My first
impressions are extremely underwelming. It seems to have even more flat
spot off idle and accelerating.  I ran out of time last night to do any
more playing with it but will see what I find hopefully after work
tonight.  I've made some assumptions (and know fully what assume means)
on the set up, and I also need to verify that my vacuum port on the carb
is operating properly. I used the one on the left side, opposite the
choke.  If anyone has any insight on this distributor, I'd sure be
interested.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;      Once upon a time I posessed a Bosch distributor that performed better
&gt; than any distributor I had previously(and subsequently)ever used in my
&gt; air-cooled VW's.  Her alphanumericals were such:
&gt;      JFUR4
&gt;      9 230 081 059
&gt;      IND BRASILEIRA
