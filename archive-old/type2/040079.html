Subject: Question reagrding compression test

Just did a compression test on my ailing '82
Westfalia. 
#1 90
#2 120
#3 110
#4 120

Added a few drops of oil on #1 but only saw a rise to
95 so not suspecting rings.  Looks like valves. OK,
but also noticed that plugs #1 and #2 had gasoline on
them.  #1 also had what looked like permatex antiseize
compound on it but later determined it was oil with
pulverized metal flakes. Possibly my valve has been
pulverized? Plugs #3 and #4 were black carbon fouled.
Guessing that my cold start valve maybe flooding
things?  Any suggestions for a confused newbie?

Thanx

Greg
