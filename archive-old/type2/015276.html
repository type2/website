Subject: oil gauge senders - part II
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19990528021744.00a90470_at_mail.bhm.bellsouth_dot_net&gt;

today was the day... oil needed changing and it was past time i 
got these gauges i had spent $ on installed. this is a '78 AVP
2.0 rebuild.

I drain the oil like a regular oil change and wait until just dripping.
while oil is draining i realize i need a 24mm or 15/16 deepsocket to
remove the stock oil  press. sender... new oil pressure sender will  have
to be installed  another day... and ran wires from engine to dash for the
gauges....
then i remove the two screws (flathead screws w/ washers) that hold  the
sump plate to the case. from what ive been told i think VW used 6?8mm?
bolts to hold the sump plate. AVP uses flathead screws.  I would prefer
bolts, but what do i know...

once the screws were out the plate it didnt fall out as i expected...
found my smallest flat blade screwdriver and  gently pried the  edge up
until i could get a grip and it came right off :)

AVP had sent me a sump plate with sensor from a 914. I goto install the
sump plate and quickly realize that the oil dipstick is in the way.
after thinking about it awhile i went ahead and installed the 914 plate.
finished the oil change (and new filter).

dipstick doesnt go all the way down as it did before.... doesnt matter
how you twist turn etc....I filled the  filter with oil before installing.
and filled the bus with 3.7Qts total 
bus was on level ground.. damn near level if not...

turned the engine over with coil  wire off.. 
then cranked it up..
let sit...
oil reads even with the &quot;ADD&quot; line.

so my dipstick is no longer accurate.

options:
1- remark dipstick and hope it is  accurate...
2- get sump plate i removed drilled for VDO sender
3- buy predrilled sump plate like i had.

#2 or #3 is what i wanna do.

I have a new temp. sender to install in predrilled plate.
I dont have the tools to drill the sump plate.

Anyone on the list able/willing to do it?
i cant afford to buy a $30 plate.....
cost is an issure for me...

any help is appreciated....

thanks-
Rob
