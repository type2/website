Subject: VW's, Bolivia and San Francisco

        In less then six days I'm off to Bolivia for a month, so I'll be
signing off Sunday night.  A whole month with out the list will be tough,
but a purge may be good for the system. I'll be sure to keep a good record
of what I spot, especially in the way of older splits, and post my
findings.
              This trip is just a preliminary for next year, so my wife
wants me to get the lowdown on the hybrid bay-split camper. We saw one at
the Dutch meet last month and it was quite the sight.
        Anyway, after four weeks of Bolivia I'm going to a conference in
San Francisco. The conference will only take up the first few days,
November 20 -24, and then I'm free until the 27th when I return to
Copenhagen. Anyone from the list in the SF area that would like to talk
split transporters, South American vws, or whatever else please let me
know. I'll bring photos.
        By the way, this is not a dig for a place to stay. Don't want it,
don't need it. I'm all booked in a hotel in downtown SF.
