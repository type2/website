Subject: Re: [T2] Re: short in our bus

Here's the deal as I remember it:
	If you remove the battery cable from either terminal of the battery and 
connect one lead of the volt meter to the battery (where you   took the 
cable off) and the other lead to the disconnected battery cable, the 
voltage reading should theoretically be 0 . A reading of 12 volts will 
typically indicate a short. Once this test has shown that a short may 
exist, my next step is usually to remove one fuse at a time and see if 
any single fuse makes the volt meter read zero. If I find that one fuse 
makes the volt meter drop to zero, I know that the problem is in the 
circuit that the removed fuse was protecting. Hope this helps.
P.S. Depending on which cable you remove and which lead of the volt 
meter you connect to the battery/cable, the polarity of your reading 
will change. Not a big deal for digital volt meters but with an analog 
meter this may be a problem.
