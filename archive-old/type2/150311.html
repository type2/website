Subject: List Members in Salt Lake City

Hi Volks,

My employer has me travelling again.... next week I'm scheduled to be  
heading out to Salt Lake City for a training course. Last trip to  
Phoenix I met up with &quot;Bus Captain&quot; Ray Nemo.... If there are any  
list members in that area who have time to get together when I arrive  
on Monday night next week drop me a line at greg_AT_pottsfamily_dot_ca.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
