Yes, but the engine will be out to torque the heads. There's no other 
way to do it!

&gt; Tis wintertime.  Be careful of the paint
&gt; manufacturer's minimum drying temperature.  In the
&gt; 40's and 50's, most paints won't dry.  And below 30F
&gt; the paint will &quot;krinkle&quot; and look awful.  Uhh, is the
&gt; barn heated?

Yes, by the God-almighty sun! I live in San Diego! Ambient temperatures 
in &quot;barn&quot; usually 75-80 degrees by mid-afternoon. In January. Yes, in 
January.
