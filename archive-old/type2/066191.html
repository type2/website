&gt; Volks,

&gt; Sean,
&gt;
&gt; I don't know all the combos, but here is what I do know....
&gt;
&gt; '73 - The &quot;suicide&quot; Westy
&gt;       sink/cooler cabinet behind passenger seat
&gt;       jump seat behind driver seat
&gt;       table against driver side wall.
&gt;       bed/seat located to driver side of bus
&gt;       clothes cabinet located on passenger side from behind sliding door
&gt;       to rear of bus. creating a &quot;semi-&quot; sized blind spot :-(
&gt;
Basically my '66 Westy is the same as the '73 except for the following:

        Non-walkthrough has 3/4 bench behind cab seat with a little
storage behind it and a lot underneath (it also faces backwards).  I don't
have the original sink/icebox thingy but I think it was not supposed to
have a sink, just a water supply with a faucet and a little fold-out table
on the pass. side for putting a basin on (but only with the door open!).
The '71 unit I am using has a sink.
        The non-sliding doors are a bit more useful: the front one has
another little fold out table and the rear one has the wonderful &quot;spice
rack&quot;.
        The table, closet and seat/bed are the same.  I have a small
cabinet in the rear driver's corner which goes from the top of the engine
compartment to the ceiling shelf (which had a door then) and the bed foam
is cut to go around this.
        The pop-top is square and has no beds for anyone.  There is a
canvas cot which goes over the cab seat and curtains for the front
windows.  Five of the side windows are jalousie windows but the one in the
closet is regular, these all have curtains too.

I think I like the non-walkthrough better because it has more available
seating and storage and when I decide to make a cab-divider it will be a
lot easier.
