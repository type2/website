Subject: Re: [T2] Funny clutch

&gt; I'd push the clutch in, and the engine would race, as if I'd hit the gas
pedal.

Sounds like the throttle is sticking.  Even though you're taking your foot off
the gas when you hit the clutch, the throttle is staying open, for at least a
moment, before returning to idle.

My Bus has never done this, but a Subaru that I used to own did it once.  It's
probably as simple as something needing lubrication -- possibly the throttle
cable or the gas pedal mechanism?  Something in the carburetor itself?  As
long as you're not afraid to disconnect the throttle cable on both ends to
help isolate the problem, it should be pretty easy to tell what's hanging up.

(Caveat: Any amount of disconnecting/reconnecting or otherwise messing with
the throttle cable is fairly likely to cause it to break off at one end or the
other.  If this happens, be glad that you've identified this weakness in your
garage and not hundreds of miles of home where you would need to fix it with a
coat hanger or whatever.  Throttle and clutch cables are both inexpensive and
neither gives any warning before it fails, so I always carry spares of both.
Shouldn't you?)

Or... don't later-model Buses have some kind of emissions control gadget
that's supposed to return the throttle to idle *gradually* when you take your
foot off the gas, instead of letting it return immediately?  My Bus doesn't
have one of these, but if it did, I'd try disconnecting it before messing with
anything else.

Cheers,

- Miles
