Subject: defrost lever question

Hello, I have a question regarding the defrost lever and its cables on my 76
transporter.  One cable goes to the lever on the tube under the dash, and
the other seems to go under the car.what does it go to?  I just got thru
replacing the heater cables, and am trying to get all this to
function..........................
