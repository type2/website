&gt;Beat on this thread a little more, saw today where Sears has LT195/75R14
&gt;trailhandlers m/s tread 4 for 199.00 rated at 1380# _at_ 50psi usual
disclaimers
&gt;ymmv, no association, yadda yadda


I have an older version of these very tires on the '77 (the ones I
previously called narrow) but I know they stopped selling these (made by
Michelin) right after I bought mine as I went looking for another set for
the '85 a few months later and could only get 2, period like the last 2
available to Sears anywhere.  Anyway they have been a nice tire, truely an
OK all season (much better than the XZX in snow), but not very rough to
ride, lasted a good 40k or so on the '85.  $50 a pop for a proper tire is
great but I do worry perhaps these are not a C load range version (seems
back then they had both).  Mine are Trailhandler AT's (but not really an AT
tread so much), state load range C, and are 1435 lb _at_ max 50 psi.  1380
seems a bit low but the max inflation is correct.
