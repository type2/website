From: &quot;john kolak&quot;
&gt; In our local VW club we have an SBC engineer who gave me quite an eye
&gt; opening chat on the difference between US and German auto engineering and
&gt; manufacturing. He said the junior german engineers who work on designs 
&gt; have
&gt; to have their work scrutinized by senior engineers who make them justify
&gt; everything and be sure all the math was correct for the application,
&gt; including how many and what size bolts are used.

Yah?.. lol,,, so your saying that *ALL* the senior engineers went on 
vacation when the Vanagon was engineered?

D'oh
Jamie.. did I say that out loud.... Rivers
