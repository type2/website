Subject: head temperature sensor

Hi guys,

I tested my temperature head sensor today. I first disconnected the sensor 
wire but left the sensor installed. To take the measurements I simply 
connected my positive lead to the sensor wire and the negative lead to the 
ground terminal of my battery. Is this right? I took a resistance reading 
when the sensor was cold and found 10k ohms. I then started the bus with the 
meter connected and watched the reading. The resistance dropped to 500 ohms 
after about 5 minutes of running. It seemed to stabalise around this point.

I reconnected the sensor wire and started the bus. It ran for less than a 
minute and shut down. The same occurs when I restart.

I believe that the sensor is deffective but I am trying to make sense of 
this situation.

Why does the bus run when the sensor is disconnected? Shouldn't it be seeing 
an open circuit at the sensor input?

In one case when I disconnected the sensor wire the bus would not start at 
all. I reconnected and it started and died. I then disconnected the sensor 
wire and it started and remained running.

Am I missing something here?
