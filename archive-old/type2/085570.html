Subject: Re: [T2] FRIDAY - Water Injection System

Actually water cools better because of the higher thermal transfer
coefficient and heat capacity.  There are the same # molecules at a given
temp and pressure for all ideal-like gasses.  Water is superior to nitrogen
because of is lower molecular weight (18 grams/mol vs 28 grams/mol) and the
additional internal energy degrees of freedom since it is trimolecular (H20)
vs bimolecular (N2).  The O-H vibrational modes are especially good at
energy transfer due to the very low mass of hydrogen.  Helium is also a very
good thermal transfer gas even though it has essentially no internal degrees
of freedom.

&gt; Jason,
&gt; 
&gt; Ummm....I must have been asleep for about 10 years or something...
&gt; 
&gt; What? notoriously *hot* t4 engine are we discussing here??????
&gt; 
&gt; Moisture laden air is able to absorb more heat or cool cause it is
&gt; &quot;thicker&quot;....or as the physicists among us will call heat absorbtion
&gt; factor.  More molecules of water in the air means it is denser and can do
&gt; more &quot;work&quot; to heat or cool.
&gt; 
&gt; Splashing a lot of water on the bottom of the case always helps too!
