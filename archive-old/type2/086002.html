Howdy,

Personally I think your buddy would be better off to drive/fly out to CA, 
pick up a mint bus from out there somewhere,  and then drive it back.  13k 
goes a long, long way, even if you buy a POS you can put allot of parts and 
paint onto it before you will reach the ammount of money he would be 
spending on this baby.  I am sure its nice, but theres so many things that 
could still go wrong with it you couldn't predict you would be better off to 
go &quot;steve dolan style&quot; and get a roling shell with a decent body, custom 
build an engine, and fix it up from there.  JMHO.  It would really suck to 
buy a sweet ride like that and then have everything crap out cause it sat 
for so long. As allways YMMV
