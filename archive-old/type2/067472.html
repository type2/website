&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you think I can answer how old are you?? Or it's not appropriate?? Over
&gt;&gt;50   and dealing badly with that
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;I'm 52.  Take my word for it, it doesn't improve....get used to it.  ;-)

Ah, come on guys! Your age is the *ONLY* THING IN THE WORLD YOU DO NOT 
HAVE CONTROL OVER!

:-0

Try to create a positive mind space about it and move on! I have a 
YOUNGER friend who is dreading her 30th birthday and she lies about her 
age all the time... that's got to be the ultimate in DENIAL! For 
Cry-y-y-y-y-y-ing out loud!

Afterall - they say WE'RE going to be the first gerneration to take a 
hundred years to turn 50 - so sit up straight - put a smile on your 
face and be proud you made it this long!!!
