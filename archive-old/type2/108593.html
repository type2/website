Subject: 34 PICT-3 details

The gasket kit for my 34 PICT-3 is a multi use set for the 30 PICT-2, -3, and
the 34 PICT-3. The instructions state that the needle valve gasket thickness
is different for the various models as follows:
  a.. 30 PICT-2         1.0 MM
  b.. 30 PICT-3         1.5 MM
  c.. 34 PICT-3         0.5MM
The only gasket supplied in the kit however is 1.0 MM thick. Does this really
make enough difference that I should try to locate a 0.5 MM gasket? When I
took the carb apart, I noticed that there was no gasket used.

Thanks,
Bill Moon
