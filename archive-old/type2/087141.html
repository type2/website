Subject: t4 cams was Re: [T2] lifters?

David,

Have you tried the 107i?

I would be interested in hearing from anyone about the difference between 
the 107i and the 91.

I am interested in the 91, but am going to use non stock fi(megasquirt).

Has anyone tried the 91 with stock fi?  Is the limitation for this
really that the afm that quits metering past about 4,000 rpm?

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;We are rebuilding a 2.0l for our 72 bus, we plan on travelling alot and
&gt; &gt;possibly towing a trailer, but the question is shoulw we use solid lifters or
&gt; &gt;upgrade to hydraulic, and would an upgrade in the cam be good, if so what. We
&gt; &gt;are also using dual dellorto36mm. thanks
&gt; 
&gt; I've had both for many years and I prefer the hydraulics.  Less maintenence 
&gt; is good - gives you more time to enjoy driving your bus.
&gt; 
&gt; As for cam, I am going with the WebCam 107i:

&gt; 
&gt; I have heard good things about WebCam from engine builders on this list.  I 
&gt; also have Dellorto DRLA's, btw (40's).
&gt; 
&gt; Be careful towing that trailer.  Get lots of gauges and monitor them 
&gt; closely.  I can't count the number of times I've heard, &quot;I used to have a 
&gt; bus, but it died while we were towing a small trailer cross-country&quot;.
