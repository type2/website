Hi Volks,

I spent some &quot;quality time&quot; in the driveway this afternoon with my new 
1977 Sunroof Automatic. I figured out how to get the starter to engage 
and once I replaced the fuel filter and put some gas in the beast it 
lit up immediately. Good Lord but it was LOUD. It seems to idle OK with 
the weber progressive but I didn't run it long because of the excessive 
exhaust noise.

Well, it's no wonder it was loud,  the D/S heater box has broken away 
from the head. Looks like one stud is broken, too. I shut it down and 
pulled the plugs to  check the compression, as the P.O. had reported 
low compression on the 1-2 side.

Compression read  0, 135, 130, 125.  I pulled the valve cover and found 
both valves on the #1 cylinder to be adjusted almost all the way out. I 
was able to reset the exhaust but the intake would not back out far 
enough. After I pulled the rockers off I could see a mark on the spring 
retainer where it has been hitting the rocker.

Ouch.  Obviously something bad is happening in there. This head has the 
same p/n as my spares do: 022101372G;  I'm told it is a 76-78 2L head. 
The fan shroud is labelled GD053106, and the engine is labeled D014540. 
It looks like it might have a number before the D but I can't make it 
out.

In my spares bin I have a D/S heater box from a 74 1.8L parts engine, 
will this bolt up? It looks like it will, and on the bench it fits 
nicely to the spare head. Somehow I had the impression that 75-78 
engines all used the triangle-port exhaust , but the engine in the bus 
has heater boxes with the &quot;D&quot;-shaped 4-bolt flanges at the end.

One more question: The seller included an engine from a 75 bus, which 
was running when pulled and reportedly has very good compression. Since 
it came from a 75 he assumed it was a 1.8L. I've checked the S/N on the 
block and it's GE013006; the library says that's  a California 79 2L. 
It has triangle-flanged heater boxes and a custom muffler cobbled out 
of iron pipe, complete with pipe threads.

This engine is complete with ALL the FI gear installed, and includes 
the AFM, etc. The p/n on the AFM is 0280200012. The only parts I seem 
to need to run this engine are a fuel pump and an airbox. So here's the 
question: Can I bolt this engine up into a 77 Automatic tranny?

If I can bolt up the spare engine, I'll replace the busted 1-2 cylinder 
head on the current engine and install this 2L into &quot;Bob the Tomato&quot; 
using either its current weber progressive.  If that proves problematic 
Bob's dual solexes can be rejetted  and used instead. This will give me 
more time to work on the oil leak that has plagued &quot;Bob&quot; since last 
summer, and then Bob's engine can go into &quot;Franklin&quot;, my Dad's 75 
Westy. But if that won't work, can I bolt the 79 california engine into 
&quot;Bob&quot;?  (&quot;Bob&quot; has a 79 federal body). My dream is to eventually put a 
2L injected engine into &quot;Bob&quot;, but getting the sunroof running is a 
higher priority at the moment. If the GE engine with FI is compatible 
with the auto tranny then I'm all for it; the 2L with weber can be 
repaired and installed sometime later.

I'd like to do this with as little labour as possible, as I don't have 
a proper place to work on these here and I'd rather be driving than 
wrenching. I'm not all that worried about keeping stock configurations; 
neither of my buses are stock now. Besides, I am not planning on 
selling them down the line and I am doing more and more of my own 
maintenance lately anyway. What I do want is for them to be dependable 
and offer a reasonable amount of performance. Over time I will evaluate 
performance and obtain the correct parts to return to a more stock 
configuration according to how economic factors and parts availability 
allow.

Please bring on any and all relevant experience,my flame suit is ready 
and waiting.

Happy trails,
