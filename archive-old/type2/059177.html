Russel, this is a 100% AOK great set.  Everything is perfectly identical.
The only difference between a '77 and '78 is the '78 came with hydraulic
lifters, pushrods, springs, etc which doesn't affect you a bit save that if
the '77 is on its origional engine and has not hydraulics you will have to
do valve adjustments every oil change like the rest of the VW world.  Major
bonuses are they share the same style heater boxes, all sheetmetal,
everything.  You simply unbolt from the '77 and pop her in, would take a
good full Saturday to do.  Replacing the clutch at the same time would be a
good idea as matter of course (at least having one ready) but if either has
a nearly new one I wouldn't even do that.  A bit of trouble could exist in
the very unlikey situation one is an auto tranny and one is not, then you'd
have to figure which way you wanted to go, swap driveplates for flywheels or
whatever.  But all in all a straightforward no problem sort of thing.  '79
is different with different heads, requires nearly the full exhaust to be
'79 (1 year only) parts.  '76 is identical to '77.  Very minor differenced
in the FI crept in '76 to '78, the deletion of a full throttle switch and
the like, so best to just take the entire FI out of the running '77
including the computer for use in the '78 and keep whatever '78 parts are
about for potential spares.
