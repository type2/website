To One and All

Volksfest 96  is now history!!!  If you didn't make it over to Yakima this
week-end you
missed one of the really great Shows and Swap meets of the year.  The
Cruise-in and Poker-Run was also a success on Saturday.  Over 50 cars in the
Poker-run.  It was a beautiful Sun filled week-end.  There were over 150 cars
Shown, and the Swap
meet was twice as big as last year.  We gave away tons of prizes, the kids
had a 
ball, had lots of games for them to play.  We had Valve Cover Car races, they
were
a real crowd pleaser, bet there will be a lot more Cars next year. The
Pacific North-
west &quot;Thing&quot; Club came over in force, they were at least 30 strong.  The
Cascade
Kombi's were there, as well as a water-cooled Club from the Seattle area.  I
know I'am missing some, there was a bunch of Beautiful Cars on display today.
 If you 
didn't make it over, plan for next year, I promise you'll have a ball.
