Subject: seat belts

does anyone have a seat belt for the middle of the back seat for a 70
bus. I am looking for a new one if possible. I have a 6month old baby
girl who I would like to put in the bus as safely as possible. I
currently have a seat belt in the back seat but it is so old I can't
adjust it and it drives me nuts. Any help would be appreciated. Or if
anyone knows where I can order a new one that would work too.
Sharon
