Check your axle stubs, too. I've been whining for a while about a noise that
I thought was wheel bearings. The noise didn't correlate to engine speed,
transmission engaged, or anything other than vehicle speed, above 35 or so.
It would quit when I turned the wheel to the right a little. (Slight right
turn shifted the vehicle weight towards the center of the bus and off the
right side wheels AND the bad axle stub... Doh!)

My mechanic, who doesn't want me to spend money (!) if I don't have to, had
already replaced the driver's side front bearings because they were headed
south and took apart and repacked the passenger side just to make sure they
were OK, which they were. Had to be in the rear.

Turns out that the passenger side rear axle stub was toast, there was more
than an inch of play in there and the hub cap was full of metal.

It was an expensive thing to replace, but Vandela scampers down the road
nicely now. Mechanic says that it is usually the passenger side axle stub
that goes.

Happy motoring
