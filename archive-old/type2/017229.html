Subject: 73 Bus Tow Truck FS!!!!

Listees,

  Read carefully.  We have a Flatbed with removeable ramps Tow Truck
FS.  It has a Tire rack mounted right behind the cab.  The cap has a
small space like an extended cab behind the seats.  Not a Single Cab
style cab.

  This truck was used by and SCCA 914 owner a number of years ago.  The
truck is in Northern Cal and was running when parked. 5 years or so ago.

  It has a 1800 engine with Kadrons on type 4 manifolds in the engine
compartment.

  This is a very nice truck for a FV racer, or towing things to car
shows etc.

  $4000.00 or best offer. A Trade will be considered.

  I will be taking a few pics of this today and will be able to send
jpgs to any interested people.
