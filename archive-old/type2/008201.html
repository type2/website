From the &quot;Questions I wish I didn't have to ask&quot; department:

The motor on my '76 seems to have come with two 1-2 heads. The head that 
came off cylinders 3-4 does not have a temp sensor hole. When I took off 
the carbs that came with the bus and installed FI, I search for the 
threaded hole for temp sensor II and screwed it into the cover 
screw hole next to #3 intake port.

I'd rather not go out searching for a new head, since this one is fine 
(except for one guide that got loose, chipped, and probably caused the 
damage that led to the low compression in that cylinder in the first place).

So the question is: could I just drill a hole in the fin between the #3 
spark plug and the port, then tap it? (The head really is an 022 101 372G).
Is that the only difference between the 1-2 and the 3-4 heads?

Thanks in advance,
