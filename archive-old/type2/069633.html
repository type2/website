HI Volks,  I'm wondering if the transmission in a '70 bus is the same
as the one in my '71.  I'm thinking of pulling one out as a spare.  I'm
sure it will function correctly, but I have heard that '71 has different
gear ratios or something.  Can someone enlighten me?

THANX,  Chris  '69, '71 Westys and assorted Beetles
