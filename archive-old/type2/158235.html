&gt; i'm in a bit of a bind here. i am under the bus with the wheels off and I
&gt; stupidly used two hydraulic jacks to hold it up. well they have slowly
&gt; deflated while I was working on the center pin problem. i was able to drag 
&gt; my
&gt; lap top under here using a breaker bar to type this. Will someone please 
&gt; call
&gt; my wife to tell her to come out and get me out! She is pissed as hell at me
&gt; right now as I have spent too much time and money on the bus, and thinks I 
&gt; am
&gt; out with some bus friends. I have yelled for an hour and she can not or will
&gt; not respond. I just need her to jack it up a bit to get me out. I'm Ok just
&gt; need to get out. I am a little tight under here and it is raining. Call her 
&gt; at
&gt; 4239571591 and tell her I am out here. This is uncomfortable. Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; 
   I called the number. The guy who answered said she's busy... ;-)
