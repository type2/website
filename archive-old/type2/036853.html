Subject: Dual Kadrons and other goodies

My rebuilt 1600 dp with CW crank, balanced fully,smoothed intake and exhaust
ports, and extractor exhaust needs a little more OOMPH at highway speeds. I
am thinking about dual Kadrons and 1.25 ratio rocker arms. Anyone have an
opinion (boy, that's a loaded statement)on the effect these mods would have?
Would they affect reliability?Any help or information would be greatly
appreciated. TBear

Don't take life too seriously - you'll never live through it.
