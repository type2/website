&gt; My friend Tom Tarka just purchased a 67, and is driving it from San 
&gt; Diego to DC. He is currently in San Fran, and heading this way. He is in 
&gt; need of some parts, and frankly having only bays I don't know of a good 
&gt; source in the Scaramento Area.

So he's coming to Sacramento or ??

&gt; Here is what he is looking for:
&gt; Drivers Side Stationary Door Glass
&gt; 2 Rims

I've got lots of 14&quot; wheels, not clear on &quot;driver's side
stationary door glass&quot; as &quot;stationary&quot; and &quot;door&quot; tend to
be mutually exclusive...
