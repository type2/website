Are you sure you packed enough questions into that one post? LOL!

Don't bother with an electric heater unless you are connected to shore
power. It takes way too much juice to power a resistive heater to expect a
reasonable sized battery and alternator to carry the load.

Instead, check out this webpage that will tell you all you ever wanted to
know about the VW heating system and how to jazz it up and get it working
well.

To activate the aux blower you have to push the leftmost (I think) heater
control lever all the way down.
