Subject: Re: [T2] 10 Digit Vin numbers? 

&gt; (number on the plate behind the windsheild on the
&gt; dash) is only 10 digits, and they all require 17.
&gt; Am I NOT getting the right number, or
&gt; is a 72 bus just too old to have the 17 numbers?

The new system of VIN numbers was introduced in 1980
with the Vanagon. So all the Baywindow buses have
either the 9-digit VIN (1968-1969 models) or the
10-digit VIN (1970-1979 models)

&gt; number I got btw is 2262093801.

If that VIN is correct than you have a 1976 bus
instead of a 1972:

22 = model:  VW microbus
6 = modelyear: 1976
2093801 = serial number

&gt; Is their any site that will help decode
&gt; NON 17 digit VIN's? 

If you want to know more about your car you can check
out the M-plate. It is a metal plate with codes fixed
on the metal wall behind the drivers seat. I made a
site about it with the explanation:

If you have any questions let me know!



yours,


Vincent
