Subject: Re: [T2] knuckle slammer shifter

i removed the shiter lever, the conical spring, and the plate. looking into
the front shift rod from above i found no grease [this bus had a history of
a leaking front windshield], some rust, and to my surprise - a hole where
the shift ball engages. that's not supposed to be there is it?

when i sink my finger into that elbow of the front rod it has about 2-3mm
of side to side play. is that normal?
