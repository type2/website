&gt; I removed the fan (with the hack saw), then removed the motor casing by
&gt; taking out the two screws and wedges that held it in place.  That's when
&gt; fortuosity hit.  The blower fit the plate exactly.  I'm not kidding.  It's
&gt; as if the manufacturer designed that blower to fit that plate.

What an excellent development!

&gt; I still have to figure out the wiring.  I want
 to use the stock wiring for the original fan.  I'll modify it at the dash
 for a switch.

Why not just stick with the stock wiring? It's relayed.
 
&gt; I'm not really concerned about actually ducting the air to the
&gt; blower, as long as I can draw cabin air through the quarter panel.  At least
&gt; until someone warns me of some danger in doing so.

I don't know about danger, unless you run the same risk as a leaky
rear hatch in sucking exhaust fumes. But anyway, the point of ducting
cabin air is that your heater will run hotter if you reheat cabin air
instead of having to heat cold outside air. If you don't run a duct,
you will lose this benefit.

&gt; I figure that I'm avoiding the melting fan issue by installing the blower
&gt; before the heated air.

This is correct. There are plastic parts in the stock blower too.

&gt;  If this works, we'll be warm and happy bus people.

There are additional factors involved in having a warm bus. My heater
blows good and hot, but I have so much cold air coming in through bad
door and window seals that we freeze when it gets more than moderately
cold. For additional tips on insulating, exhaust wrapping, and
sealing, see the library and Richard's site.

Have fun,

John
