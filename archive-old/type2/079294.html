Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top hold downs

the cheap way to do it is grab some of the Baja bug hood hold downs, work
great and fit the anchors just fine.

&gt; What he said, plus the following:
&gt;
&gt; When I redid my hold downs, I bought 3 of the black rubber replacements
from
&gt; Bus Depot.  Turns out, the rubber parts are the same for all three hold
&gt; downs, it's the metal parts that are different.  Even on the side hold
&gt; downs, the metal parts of the new hold downs didn't quite fit.  So, I
&gt; drilled out the rivets that hold the metal parts to the rubber parts on
the
&gt; new and old hold downs, and swapped stuff around so I had the old metal
&gt; parts on the new rubber parts, which I re-assembled using the appropriate
&gt; size screws and nuts.  Looks good, works good.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Just a quick question.
&gt; I was on the phone with BusDepot recently purchasing, among other =
&gt; things, pop top hold downs, (you know, those little rubber &amp; metal =
&gt; things that keep the top from flying away.)
&gt; Well, on my '72 Westy there are 3 of them.  According to the guy at =
&gt; BusDepot, all 3 hold downs
&gt; are *exactly* the same.  But on my bus, the 2 side ones are the same and =
&gt; the 3rd one, nearest=20
&gt; the luggage rack, is different.
&gt; Can someone clear this up?  Is the Depot wrong?  If so, where can I get =
&gt; this 3rd/different hold down?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; -Paul
&gt; -'72 Westy
&gt;

&gt;  I had the same problem. They ARE different AND the originals on a 72 are
a
&gt; grey or off white color. The ones you can get aftermarket today are black.
&gt; If you aren't restoring its no big deal. Another thing (off topic) is the
&gt; water filler tube. Aftermarket ones are grey and they should be white.
&gt;
&gt; Your only hope is to find a donor bus with good ones. It is tough to find
a
&gt; rear pop top hold down thats not dry rotted. If you find one you can
&gt; probably pick me up some original curtains too!!  :)
