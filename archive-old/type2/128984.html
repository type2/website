Subject: wiring on a VDO 50-150 Cel. oil temp gauge??

 I've acquired a 50 - 150 degree Celsius oil temp gauge from a GTI. It has a
single wire light connection on the back so uses a standard body ground to
supply the ground. That I understand. The part I don't understand is that
there are three wires on the back of it still. The middle one is brown and
touches the gauge body so I assume that is the ground for it. There are
still two more however that are unmarked. Do BOTH of these go to a temp
sender?? I am not sure, as no markings are on the gauge back. The other two
wires are a black one, and a green/black-stripe one. Help??
