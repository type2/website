Subject: Of tire sizes, gear ratios, and the like (GEAR2000.XLS)

Some out there have been tossing around my crappy
little Excel spreadsheet that calculates speed at rpm
for various ratios and diameters and the like for a few
years now.

I've modified it a bit, the new copy is hanging at:

http://www.type2_dot_com/~keen/johna/gear2000.xls

free to use, download, modify, whatever.  Can give some
of you syncro dreamers an idea of what you are getting into.

Though you'd need to add a column for a 5 speed (I've had
it before as I had to drive the Quantum according to the tach
and a little table taped on the horn button as the speedo never
worked right.)

Anyway if you like it, do what you will with it, add tables,
whatever.  It is short, small, and functional.
