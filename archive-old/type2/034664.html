&gt;&gt; Paul, I need a statement from you as to your intent. The motor you
&gt;&gt; purchased is still sitting in front of my shop. My stated goal in offering
&gt;&gt; this motor for sale was to get this thing out of my way. I have obviously
&gt;&gt; not reached this goal because you have failed to follow through with the
&gt;&gt; shipping.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; At no time did I agree to storing this motor for you for an indefinate
&gt;&gt; period. You must state as a certainty the date this motor will be gone from
&gt;&gt; my care. Without that, I will reoffer the motor for sale to the several
&gt;&gt; others who inquired and made offers and once it is out of here, I will
&gt;&gt; refund your payment or portion thereof that is recovered by my additional
&gt;&gt; actions to meet my goal, that is, get this thing into the hands of someone
&gt;&gt; else who has need of it and will follow through in a reasonable time frame
&gt;&gt; to pick it up.

&gt;Tim,

&gt;I was hoping to have it out of your place of business last week.  I recently
&gt;needed an operation which has prevented me from working.  I own my business,
&gt;and have been trying to keep my head above water.  Please allow me until next
&gt;Wednesday (5 days from now) to let you know what I can do.  I do want the
&gt;engine, but paying employees and keeping my building seem a little more
&gt;important than getting a good engine for  my bus - at least until I get some
&gt;money flowing in from A/R.   I do apologize this has happened, but I will
make
&gt;good on the shipping end or tell you I can't by Wed.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;
&gt;Paul

I have not heard from him since. Wednesday came and went, several times. 

If someone wants to buy him out, they must be committed to getting the
motor shipped out of here post haste. I do not wish to do another rendition
of selling this motor. It is Paul's motor, he has all the info on the
motor. Contact him for all info and negotiation for purchase. If he will
confirm sale to someone, I will then arrange for pickup by the purchasers
shipper.

Again, all questions to Paul, the owner.
