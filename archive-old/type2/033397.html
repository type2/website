Hi Volks,
=20
I've rejoined the list to ask for advice about my 1973 westy.
=20
The old girl has served me well, I've driven her 30,000 miles in the =
three years I've had her. Almost daily, for about 18 months she was the =
only car the family had. When I first got the van, I bondo'd and =
brush-painted it so it didn't look too bad, but it was clear even then =
that there was more rust than metal. Three years later the van is still =
drive-able, but I'm getting apprehensive about taking the family too far =
from home in it. Maybe it's time to pass her along, she's got lots of =
good stuff for transplant. Does someone have a solid rolling-chassis =
they need a motor/interior for? The westy interior is also in good =
shape, and I still have the icebox/sink, although it's not in the van at =
the moment.
=20

The Good Stuff:=20
 - I put 5 new tires on it this year, there are maybe 2,500 miles on 3 =
of them, 1500 on the other pair.
 - Twin-carb motor runs well, just puffs a bit of blue smoke during =
upshifts. 40,000 miles since rebuild.
 - The aftermarket muffler is about 16 months old, rusty but not =
perforated.
 - The Erspacher gasoline furnace works well.
 - The front seats are better than stock.
 - Camper interior cabinetry is in good shape although the fabric needs =
cleaning.
 - Brake Master cylinder was replaced in June.
 - Clutch cable was replaced in August.
 - Trailer hitch
 - Middle seat from Type 2 passenger van also available, in good =
condition.
=20
The Bad Stuff:
 - Rust all over and under, in the usual places. I used to think the =
draft at my shoulder was a bad door seal.... in fact it turned out to be =
a hole in the wheel well behind the drivers seat. The rust elsewhere is =
gaining on me, and winter (salt-season) approaches once more.
 - The big screen in the pop-top is shredded, but the side windows are =
OK.
 - The heater boxes are long gone. (Surprise, surprise.)
 - The windshield is in bad shape, but every other window is intact.
=20
The bus is in Toronto, Canada. I can't part it out, it has to go whole.
I'm willing to drive to the border if the buyer will cover my bus fare =
home, but only for a confirmed sale. I can email digital pics of =
specific parts of the bus if you're interested in making an offer. I'd =
also be interested in trade for an interesting motorcycle, esp. a =
dual-sport/enduro model.
=20
Thanks for your time,
