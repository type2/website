Sorry the sale price of my last message didn't come out.

Ideal Project for Summer, Essex, England

1977 (R) Beige VW 12 seater bus conversion.
6,000 miles on reconditioned VEGE engine (receipts available)
2 sliding doors, awning, fold down double bed, sink and wardrobe.

This bus is solid throughout but unfortunately needs a new front axle
and there is some cosmetic decay.

House purchase forces sale but she must go to a good home. 500.00 (five
hundred pounds)
