Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

here's a crazy idea... (only people with a sense of humor should read
this as i am not serious at all)

drill 10 holes in the dash and install 10 salvaged ignitions and wires
going to behind the kick panel, tied down so they feel like they go
somewhere... with only one of them leading to real wires. that should
confuse em!

i know, shut up and go back to your hole, chris...
