Subject: re: [BP] 2 weeks to go until Buses Of The Corn - Crazy Driving
  Skillz-Bus wanted

Hi Volks,

I'm forwarding this on behalf of the author, Adam Narrraway.

-Crazy Driving Skillz-
Those of you who survived last years driving skillz competition may 
recall
the glory of flying, the thrill of landing, the terror of trying to not 
hit
a tree, the humiliation of really hitting a picnic table...hard.

Aside from a few folks, most of the above was performed last year in a 
bus
named buster. Buster's owner allowed us to use Buster for the 
competition,
allowing even those who are stick challanged (buster was an automatic) 
to
compete. Some people who never even driven a bus managed to compete last
year...not too shabby.
This year I am hoping someone will once again come forth with their 
bus, and
allow us to &quot;have some fun&quot; with it.
I'm not going to lie, this is a competition, so your bus will be 
DRIVEN, not
babied. (But after some consultation, I am planning to move the course, 
so
that there is less &quot;air time&quot;.)

If you are the kind of person who
     can watch their bus be driven by others
     can understand why others can't drive your bus as well as you can
     preferably has an automatic transmission
     can turn your back while your bus drives through a slalom
course.....backwards
I would like to hear from you.

Please p-mail me at adoom_at_rogers_dot_com before August 7th.

Thanks everyone,
Adam
driving skillz co-ordinator, and damn good looking too.
