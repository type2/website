&gt; (Tom Tarka) Again, my curiosity has been piqued:  has anyone who
experienced
&gt; rear wheel bearing failure and replaced only the one that
&gt; failed, later
&gt; experienced failure in the other wheel?

No, but here's some evidence nonetheless:

I experienced a failure in right rear bearing (actually not a failure, just
a very loud vibration/humming noise at highway speeds).  I replaced that
~4000 miles ago, and discovered that the bearing failure was probably
related to a loose axle nut (the 46mm jobbie) at some point in it's life.  I
carry the spares for the other side but am waiting for signs of imminent
failure before I do the job since it's a fair chunk of work.
