Subject: Re: [T2] And now with less power!

Sounds to me like you have BTDC and ATDC confused... possible?

Regardless, if you are not getting any advance and are seeing 28 degrees 
BTDC all the time, it's no wonder your engine feels sluggish.  When the 
advance kicks in, I suspect your power will return.

&gt; I get 28 degrees ATDC with vacuum and without. John Connolly explains that
&gt; this is because the rubber in the vacuum can hasn't &quot;broken in&quot; yet. I don't
&gt; think I should crank it up to 38-45 degrees ATDC with just mechanical
&gt; advance. I want to drive the bus for a while! :)
