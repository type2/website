I think the statement that these carbs and the 009 distributor don't
belong on a bus is a bit erroneous. I've been running both on my '73 bus
for several years. Had a lot of trouble with it at first, but it wasn't
the carb or the distributor's fault.
    The original poster stated that it didn't matter whether the brake
booster hose was on or off -- does that mean that you plugged the hose?
I had an a real problem much like you describe which was the booster
hose leaking. New hose helped, but then I finally had to use some
silicon gasket goo on the hose fitting on the manifold, put the hose on,
plus a real good hose clamp. Still it required periodic re-tightening.
Also the hose clamps on the manifold boots need periodic re-tightening
-- and make sure they aren't cracked. 
    I still couldn't get good throttle response -- although it was much
better after fixing the above, and thought it was the jets. But then I
checked the total throttle travel and found that when the gas pedal was
to the floor, the throttle plates weren't all the way open, in fact the
secondary was not opening much -- maybe half way. Tightening the cable
made the idle way too fast. For a long time I thought that it needed a
different length throttle arm to get more travel. I started looking at
the pedal mechanism to see if it could be modified to get more travel --
and discovered that the pedal itself was the problem. The little rod
that sticks up out of the floor makes a right angle at the top and fits
thru two stamped steel plates -- mine were bent and had slid about an
inch down the rod, so I wasn't getting full travel on the throttle at
that end. When I fixed this -- wow -- what a difference. No more
hesitation. Also got about 10 mph top end. I should say that this is on
a '81 2.0L engine in my '73 -- I previously had thought that the reason
the top end was so much slower than my '81 Vanagon was just the major
difference in final drive ratio.
