Subject: Low vacuum - continued

Volks,

Well as I said in my previous post, I have a vacuum reading of 10&quot; which
is way below where I like it.  I think I have an explanation now, tho, so
hold off on the cards and letters for a bit.  This AM I had a '73 bus with
a '78 engine, new heads and valves that sounded like the tango finals in
Barcelona :-)  First thing I took a reading and noticed a distinct lack of
balance (reading #1 on the chart below).  So I adjusted them &quot;by the
book&quot;.  Rotate the engine counterclockwise through TDC on each cylinder,
adjust valve to contact +2 turns for each cylinder.  I then took a second
round of compressions and was much happier (reading #2), but I also took
that 10&quot; vac reading and was none too happy at that.  Both of these
readings, tho, were done &quot;cold&quot; (a slight misnomer in DC in August, but we
let that slide :-) and I wanted a hot reading, so I drove the car around
the block twice (~1/2 mile) and popped the plugs out and took a
compression reading (reading #3).  Well that explains the low vacuum :-) 
Tomorrow AM, I am gonna go back to contact +1 turn, at least for cylinders
1 &amp; 3.  I will report further knowledge as I gain it :-)


         Reading #1 | Reading #2 | Reading #3
---------------------------------------------
cyl #1 |   120      |   120      |    90
---------------------------------------------
cyl #2 |   130      |   120      |   120
---------------------------------------------
Cyl #3 |   110      |   120      |    70
---------------------------------------------
cyl #4 |   120      |   120      |   120
---------------------------------------------            

Y'know, I'm liking cyl #4 better and better... dont think I'm gonna touch
that one :-)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
