Subject: Pict 3 Carbs ..

Hello Beautifull people ...

Sooo ..

	I was worried because I thought petrol was leaking from the carb on our
1600 Bus .. So I bought a rebuild kit and a new Carb.   I swapped them over
and am will rebuild the Solex one when I have a chance.

	The new carb is a &quot;Bocar&quot; one which I'm assuming is a Brazilian made
version of the Solex ...

	I went to set it up and asked my father in law to talk me through it.   His
first words are &quot;Don't touch the big one that's the mixture the little one
is the idle ..&quot;

Head in hands moment ..

	It took me an hour after he had gone to work out what was wrong ..

So I was back at the beginning .. .. I reset with 2 1/2 turns and then
adjusting the air Bypass screw (Which is the BIG ONE just incase anyone is
not sure!) to get a nice idle ..

Either Lumpy  or .. I'm chokeing

Does anyone know what the CO level should be at idle ?   I've got a gas
analyser that should help if I had any data ...

Anyone just got any advice ?    (other than regarding my father in law .. I
have plenty of ideas of him .. and they do not involve motor cars ..)
