Subject: Emergency Kit

I know it's not friday, but all this talk of road trips had me
thinking about what stuff I'll bring.

Then I saw this on Woot. I dunno. Would I really need these things?
How tough is it to remove  lug nut? (These are rhetorical questions in
case your sarcasm meter's broken):

Tighten Deez Nutz

This McCulloch Auto Emergency Kit is perfect for automotive
emergencies. Its impact wrench will lefty-loosen and righty-tighten
your lug nuts with ease, and comes with four lug sockets in popular
sizes. The air compressor inflates flat tires a whole lot faster than
your current method, and without the disorienting head rushes. Both
the wrench and compressor plug into your cigarette lighter, orfor the
health-conscious, non-smoking stranded motoristan included battery
clip extension lets you connect to your battery terminals.

Don't worry; there's nothing in here that will un-strand you if you
&quot;run out of gas,&quot; so you can still use that one.

    * Torque: 150Ft./Lbs.
