Subject: Need '68 Flasher relay

Howdy all. In the quest to make the Spiffy '68 Crew Cab all legal and
roadworthy, I need to get those turn signals and hazard lights working. I do
believe that my relay is bad, and so I need another. Unfortunately, '68 is in
that wonderful transition period, so a '69 won't easily do, although a '67
might. Anyway, if anyone has one, it's about a 2 1/2&quot; black box with about 10
or so male spade plugs on it. Please let me know if anyone has such a thing, as
I'd love to get everything fixed up.
Thanks,
