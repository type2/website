Subject: air conditioning

hey all...
I found a full air conditioning setup out of a vanagon that I could get
real easy.  Can these be put into baywindows?? Its the same style as the
bay-window era type... but it has a whole front console that goes above
the visors.  Same basic setup though..
Does anyone want this?

Could someone forward this to the vanagon list?  I'd be willing to get
rid of it.  Its in great shape.

later
Isaiah
