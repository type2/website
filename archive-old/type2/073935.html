Subject: RE: [T2] spare tire mounts

&gt; I'm going to mount my spare on the front.
&gt; I see a couple different styles at widely varying
&gt; prices.


Most of the spare tire mounts I've seen in recent years are the identical
mount, in different packaging. Made in Taiwan, not sure who the actually
manufacturer is, and then branded under one of a few different brands. It's
actually decent quality; I put one on my '77 Westy and never had a problem.
It includes instructions and hardware; installation is simple. My part
number 4225, $14.95.  I also have spare tire covers, in black (# 4222) or in
white with black piping (# 4223), also for $14.95.

The one thing you need to be careful of when using a front spare tire mount
is that when you put the spare tire on, you do not want to keep torquing
down harder and harder on the bolts until they stop turning. The outer nose
skin of your bus is rather thin and easy to bend.  Once the tire is snug
against the nose, the securing bolts can continue to turn if you keep
turning the wrench, but you will actually be bending the nose rather than
tightening the tire any more. So once it's nice and snug, stop tightening.
