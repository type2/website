&gt; I've been contemplating on what kind of heat to use in my little storage 
&gt; shed I built, and in my search for a good heater, it seems to me that a 
&gt; double-eye propane heater will work well.  I know the kerosene heaters 
&gt; work great but they are expensive.  So this got me to wondering, if one 
&gt; had a way to anchor down the propane bottle, could you use a propane 
&gt; heater with the infra-red elements?  Granted, it is sort of an &quot;open&quot; 
&gt; flame but I would think if a person anchored it real well, that it would 
&gt; be an excellent source of heat.  And all you'd have to do is make sure 
&gt; you had enough rust holes for fresh air. :-)
&gt; 

 Well......
Awhile back i was considering an aftermaket RV heater to put in my bus.
They came in two varieties, Propane , which needed a vent hole cut 
somewhere in the body(a no-no in my book) or an electric heater which 
required a second battery... 
the Electric heater is much cheaper as the propane heater warrents the 
use of a propane bottle that mounts on the underside of the bus , not 
only would it cut ground clearance, but as far as i remeber was quite 
expansive as well.  

 As of yet I have not bought the electric heater, but anyone that has one 
I'd like to hear from you... =)

anyways....
