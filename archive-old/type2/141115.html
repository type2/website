Subject: RE: [T2] Uniroyal Laredo All Season?

&gt; it is a Uniroyal AWF all season tire, Type C, 
&gt; 1435lb at 50psi, 195/75-14 6 ply tire.



1435 lbs is below the safe load capacity for a VW Bus. 

If using a light truck tire, you need a minimum of 1520 lbs load capacity
(load index 95 or above). If it is a P-rated (passenger car) tire, you need
at least 1670 lbs load capacity (load index 99 or above). This is because
according to the U.S. D.O.T.'s tire safety requirements, a passenger car
tire's stated load capacity must be de-rated by 9.1% if mounted on a light
truck (as a VW bus is classified).  

See http://busdepot_dot_com/details/tires.jsp for more details on this.
