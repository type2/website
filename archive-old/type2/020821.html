&gt; I posted a scan of the cover of the 1968 (it says 1967) Westy Manual that I

&gt;
&gt; It's pretty neat, as it has both German and English captions for all the
&gt; pictures.  As far as I can tell, the Westy interior for 1968 was the same
&gt; for 1969, so maybe a new manual was not published for 1969 (my best guess
&gt; as to why none can be found).

That wouldn't surprise me. I'm quite certain there was not one made for 1971,
but rather the 70 book was supplied instead. It said &quot;Campmobile 70&quot; on it.
