&gt;&gt; Does anyone have a list of what VW busses were called during each year and
&gt;&gt; why my insurance co. says that according to my vin number my camper is not a
&gt;&gt; camper at all it is a Kombi?
&gt;
&gt;VW made a Kombi.  Westfalia modified it into a camper.  Your insurance 
&gt;company has only the info from VW with out noting the shipment of it to 
&gt;Westfalia for modification.
&gt;
ICBC the insurance corporation here in BC... does the same thing... rates it
as a Kombi. However, If you can show that the vehicle is a mobile-home it
can rate under a camper.

To rate it as a camper it must have:
Sink
Sleeping Area
Stove
(and/or Toilet)

Since my '73 lacks a permanently mounted stove I failed to qualify...
However, a newer Westfalia...(74 and up) would (eg. HAS a Fixed Stove).
