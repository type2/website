Okay, I've been reading the threads about the dreaded 009 and poor its
performance.  I've learned to live with one for longer than I would like to
admit.

Is it true that the 050 has more total advance?   Or is the advance curve
just different?

I'd love to go back to the stock setup - but my bus came to me with a Weber
progressive setup that doesn't provide the correct vacuum connections for
the stock vacuum advance distributor to work.  If I am stuck with using a
distributor without any vacuum assisted advance, I would like it to be one
that is better suited for the type-IV motor, if possible.

Thanks in advance.
