Subject: Re: [T2] Tank Cleaning was [T2] Need parts

QUOTE:

The correct cleaning solvent for crud and rust and flakes and goo
from an old tank is acid. At the proper dilution, it cuts into
everything, including varnish, goo and steel. When properly done,
nothing in the tank remains but bright steel. Then it must be coated
with a proper sealant. If the metal is not too thin afterwards, you
get another 20+ years of functional use.
--------------------------------------------------
Just buy a few gallons of Coca-Cola and pour it into your tank.  It'll 
dissolve a penny in no time at all.  It should work on a gas tank, although 
it would take longer I suppose...
