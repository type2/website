--=====================_8303981==_.ALT


&gt;silly, i know there is a difference between 6 and 12... i was wondering
&gt;if the alt was compatible with both. sorry, misworded it. didn mean &quot;does
&gt;it matter&quot;, i meant... uh... whatever i already said. oh well, that is
&gt;why i am an artist, not a poet.
&gt;
&gt;ok, so my bus is a 70... that is 12v, right?

Yes your van is a 12 volt. I think everything went 12 volts in '66 or '67. 
When in doubt look at the battery.

It will say someplace that it is a 12 volt or 6 volt.

Another way would be to look for the vent caps if the battery has multiple 
caps then count them and multiply by two. A 6 volt battery would have 3 
vent caps, a 12 volt battery would have 6 caps.

Most modern batteries have large panels that hide the vents and cell tops 
but you can still pry them off in most cases to count the cells.

Each cell has a hole at the top where the owner can add a bit of water 
should the battery need it. Each cell (compartment of the battery) 
represents 2 volts of the total voltage the battery makes.

I think Muir tells all about batteries too with pics.

No the alternator is not compatible with both 12 volts and 6 volts. You 
would need a generator or alternator specifically for your vehicle's 
electrical system standard (12 or 6 volt).

You can convert a 6 volt car into a 12 volt car. This involves a new 
starter, new charging system (generator or alternator and the appropriate 
regulator), new battery, ALL new light bulbs, new blinker relay I think, 
and either a new wiper motor or a voltage stepdown for it.

Also comes radios, heater blowers, and things like that. There are a few 
more details I think.
