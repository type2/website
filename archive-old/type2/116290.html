Subject: Stupid Tool-Box Question

Hey guys,

	I just wanted to make sure. Will it affect the air flow / cooling of
my Bus if I decide to put a small tool-box in the space where an auxiliary
battery might go? I figured I could get one of those heavy duty plastic tool
boxes about 1.25 feet in width, 1/2 a foot in length and 1/2 a foot in
height.

It would be a great place for me to store a BASIC set of tools, a spare
ignition coil, a spare fuel pump, fuses, and other minor things. I just
wanted to ask to make sure before I went ahead and started to use that
area.. I didn't want to do anything that would upset the cooling of the
motor.

Thanks!
