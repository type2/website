Subject: Sheared off exhaust stud
Date: Sun, 14 Mar 1999 20:45:36 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

OK, flog me with a torque wrench, but I not only sheared off no less than
three studs getting the heater boxes off, I just snapped off an EZ-OUT in
the one that sheared off flush to the manifold.  So, what words of wisdom do
you engine heads have for me?  Drill it all out and re-tap a larger size?

The other two studs sheared off flush to the flange, so I have a good 1/4&quot;
or so of good stud still showing.  I'd really like to back those out.  Left
to my own devices, I'll probably use heat, wax and vibration.  Double nut
the studs and be patient.  Sound right?

Thanks.
