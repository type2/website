&gt; You can buy low cost code readers. Mine cost $7000 and does a whole lot
&gt; more than just read codes. It has flat solved problems for me 3 times in
&gt; the last year that otherwise may have taken me a dozen hours to find.

Whew.. Well, if you make a living at it, and write off the depreciation or
loss on your taxes, that is one thing.. But few of us could afford a $7,000
meter, even if that is a &quot;cheap&quot;one.
Now.... Here IS a cool solution, and I found this out when I went to look at
the '78 VW bus the other day.
This guy told me that for $45, anyone can take their car into a Tune Masters
(assuming it can be moved?) and get a complete diagnostic report from their
code reader. You pay the $45, they give you a printout, and you can go fix
it yourself.
I don't know how many states Tune Masters is in, but I'm sure that some
other outfits will do the same thing. If you have an &quot;engine warning&quot; light
on, this will tell you where to look.  Jan B
