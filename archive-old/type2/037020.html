Subject: dizzyness: fear

I was worried about the position of my dist driveshaft too, so i checked
Wilson, and all i found was how to set endplay/washers on the bottom of a
type1 dist driveshaft. Nothing about *where* the shaft goes with respect to
the drive gear on the crank. Did i miss it?

Is it true that as long as the cam/crank relationship is right (dot on cam
gear between the two on the crank) all should be well?

There is no 'backwards' for the dist drive gear or the driveshaft, right?
Right?!?

getting scared,

&gt; Anyway, does his advice sound right? I'm a little confused on the
&gt; relationship between the cam, valve position, and timing, but it seems to
&gt; me that you could not successfully install a dizzy 180 out unless you also
&gt; installed the distributor timing gear 180 out.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! Joe
