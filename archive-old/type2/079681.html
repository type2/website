Subject: Re: [T2] now what??  no fire in #2

78, FI, auto tranny

was getting a return of my intermittent miss.  very tiny only a person who
has ridden this bus for almost 10 years would notice......

however #2 isn't firing again!  there is fire at the plug, all other cyl
fire normally, compression is good, injector would act differently, almost
for sure it is elec......changed plugs &quot;Again&quot;  am running to my local
FLAPS as soon as rush hour is over to get some new SPwires...

???what am I missing???

Thanks
Bob
