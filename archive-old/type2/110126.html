&quot;Where did you see this?&quot;

It's in the owner's manuals.  I think it's in the Bentley manuals too.

&gt;&gt; Personally, I believe that more often is better.  I like to change it
&gt;&gt; every other time I change my motor oil.  If it extends the life of the
&gt;&gt; tranny, it will be well worth it.

&quot;Certainly there is no harm in this if you are doing it yourself but it
seems excessive if you are paying for the change&quot;

Yes, I change it myself.  It would be hard to justify 6000 mile 
intervals if you're being ripped off at $30 a pop.
