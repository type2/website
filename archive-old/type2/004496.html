&gt;   1972 VW Camper, Westphalia, not a pop-top.
&gt;   About 26,000 original miles. Garaged since
&gt;   1976. $3,500 or best offer.
&gt;   Rand: 408.867.4059


If that is true shit, it is the deal of the century, I've seen similar
&quot;asking&quot; $10,000 in Hemmings.  And being the non pop top is real, real, cool
as well IMHO, particularly on a '72.  If I were in CA the money would be
there today.
