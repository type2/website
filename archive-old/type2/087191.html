Subject: Re: [T2] Being sued

Bob,

But dammit, scuse my french....  the point to me here is that
the guy should be able to take a vw hubcap and turn it in to a clock and 
sell it.

Not knuckle under and die cause some lawyer says he should.
Especially if the  &quot;fair use&quot; stuff works in this case.

The one thing about this is that we don't know how Brian advertised his 
creations, but I can't imagine him saying &quot;official&quot; vw clock.


BTW, I have forwarded the e-mails with real advice over to Brian for his 
perusal.

Cheers, dave

&gt; =======================&gt;
&gt; I think that is damned good advice !!!
&gt; 
&gt; I would ignore the Hell out of that Indy attorney.
&gt; 
&gt; They defined the damage fee amount ($ 3K) in order to do a fast cheap trick.
&gt; 
&gt; Now then, how much they gonna spend to try and get that $3K ?? - Not much 
&gt; in the way of time or out of pocket expenses.
&gt; 
&gt; I would stop with the hub cap thing, tell them I have done so via certified 
&gt; mail, if it has to come to some kind of communication from me to them, and 
&gt; ignore all else.
