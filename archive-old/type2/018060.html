&gt; Hey, I know the answer to that one!!!  Whatcha got is a poor ground and
&gt; probably a missing ground strap between the body and the engine/trans.  (As I
&gt; remember it's at the nose of the trans.)  So, when you crank over the engine,
&gt; the starter (and its attendent 300+ amps) is grounding through that other fine
&gt; ground cable, err, clutch cable.  Be glad that it's not a Vanagon...  then it
&gt; would be grounding through the accelerator cable and it would MELT!

or possibly the grounds in the FI harness! (not quite able to handle the
300 A. either)
