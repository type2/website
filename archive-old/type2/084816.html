If it is really cold right now where you live you might also be dealing 
with a carb that is freezing up.

If not, be sure you have made a trip to the junkyard to accumulate the 
parts for a proper air cleaner and the hose they use to grab heated air off 
of the exhaust manifold. I fought with one of these a few years ago for a 
friend and it was hell.

Just look for anything with a carburetor. They all had factory &quot;heated&quot; air 
cleaner arrangements. You'll have to find one that fits and they usually 
use a small vacuum line to move the flapper inside.

&gt;I'm with Pops on this one.  The rubber boots where the carb base plate
&gt;connects to the manifolds are notorious for leaking.  Check the clamps as
&gt;I've seen problems with the clamps failing and they look good but don't
&gt;apply much pressure to seal the rubber.  Get it to idle as low as you can
&gt;and spray some carb cleaner on 'em.  If the RPMs increase, voila.  Get new
&gt;clamps (better yet, get new boots--their cheap).  This system is pretty
&gt;simple.  Should be easy to find the leak.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck,

&gt; &gt; My father and I are trying to get my bus, a '74 1.8l with a Webber
&gt; &gt; Progressive carb, tunedproperly. I've been having problems with the choke
&gt;'sticking' in cold
&gt; &gt; weather. Everytimewe adjust the idle down the engine dies. My father seems
&gt;to think there
&gt; &gt; may be a vacuum leak.While he has significant amounts of knowledge about
&gt;automotive mechanics,
&gt; &gt; he hasn't dealtwith this carb in a bus (or really any bus) before. I've
&gt;only had the bus
&gt; &gt; for a couple months andthe engine was rebuilt just before I got it (I
&gt;helped put it back in). But
&gt; &gt; somewhere down theroad, the correct configuration of the carb seems to
&gt;have been lost (along
&gt; &gt; with the title tothe bus).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The title is being fixed and now I'm working on the carb. Does anyone have
&gt; &gt; anypictures of a 1.8l with a webber prog PROPERLY setup? It would be VERY
&gt; &gt; helpful. Diagramswould be cool too. The Bentley and Muir books are useless
&gt;here. I almost
&gt; &gt; bought a book onwebber carbs at the FLAPS but decided to hold off as it
&gt;seemed geared towards
&gt; &gt; performance.
