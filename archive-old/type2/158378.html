Subject: '76 Camper For Sale (Maybe)

Greetings Group,

I came across a '76 Camper yesterday.  When I inquired about it, the seller
indicated that his brother-in-law was selling due to a pending move out
West (the Camper is located in North Alabama).  However, the desire to sell
is a bit half-hearted, as the seller indicated that the Camper might be
taken off the market at any time.  (Folks get attached to their VW's, don't
they?)

Why do I bore the group with this?

Quite simply, if someone has an itch for what seems to be a reasonable '76
Camper, this one could be bought for a reasonable price ($3500.00).  Keep
in mind that I don't know much about it, except for what I saw last night
(after dark).

Here's some specs:

Good
   Paint (seems reasonable; some touch-up needed)
   Engine (I heard it run -- sounds normal/smooth)
   Interior (relatively clean; claimed to be original)
   Glass (didn't really check, but didn't see any big cracks either)

Bad
   Ignition Key Slot is kludged up to get it to crank
   Fiberglass Top Needs Cleaning!
   Top Probably Needs New Weather Stripping (it's coming off)
   Potentially A Bunch Of Stuff I Didn't Think To Check

Not Checked
   Tires
   Brakes
   Underneath
   Electrical
   Sink
   Top (claimed to be in good shape)

If you'd like, let me know of your interest.  I thought about buying it
myself and putting it on ebay for a profit -- I just don't want to tie up
my money even if it's only for a few weeks.

Shameless Plug:  I have a '71 Camper that I'm about to restore.  If you
have any parts (or money!) that you'd like to offer as a finder's fee, I
won't refuse!

Hope this Camper finds/keeps a good home!

Regards,
David

P.S.  To clarify and qualify, I don't know the seller or owner personally.
I cannot support or refute any of their claims.  Also, I have nothing to
gain from the sale of this Camper, except of course that finder's fee I
mentioned! :)
