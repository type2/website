Subject: heater boxes/smog

Scott said:

I have done this switch, from '79 to 72-74. It works perfectly. Everything bolts up. I got the heater boxes from busdepot, one german and one danish, and a leistritz muffler from thesamba.

I add:

That makes me hurt, Scott.

Lord knows that after 700 posts on the issue, I still don't know when and for what busses the 30 year cal smog thing applies. 

I know I have to smog my bus now, a 76' in DEC 2002 per DMV, will I have to smog again?

It seems like I would be due in  DEC 2004, but my bus will be exempt on Jan 01, 2005 right? Is there a way out of this?

If I pass smog next week, I'm considering some serious exhaust system work, so that my engine will look like Scott's.

Later,

Billy
