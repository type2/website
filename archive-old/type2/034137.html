Subject: Re: Thermostae and fan flaps

M &amp; D,

 I would be very interested in responses you recieve. I just did a rebuild 
and had a thermostat on when I tore it down so I reassemble with the 
thermostat and after a 20 minute run, I was running hot, I checked the 
thermostat to find it not functioning properly. It was not opening the flaps 
and while it was doing the thing its suppose to do by getting to operating 
temp quick and maintaing a good temp, it would try to go right thru the roof 
. What it should do is open and keep a temp not over about 220 in a good 
climb and usually stay about 190-200.
 I questioned procedure at our highly respectable vw bus and old bug shop and 
they said they leave em off and dont worry about overheating  and frying the 
engine. I believe the people that talk about a foam in there oil at the oil 
filler cap is from running cool and it throws water off the oil some how. I 
believe thats what Ive heard.
 I would be interested to other peoples thoughts,

  Any Way, My 2 cents,
  David
