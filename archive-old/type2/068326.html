Subject: Head corrosion

 Working on a fairly good set of 2nd hand heads that show a strange
(to me) corrosion pattern.

 The top and elsewhere is perfect but the fins on the bottom side
 are thinned out like Knife-edge.

 My only guess would be possibly road salt but it's not common here
 so I really have no idea.

 Anyone seen this before?
