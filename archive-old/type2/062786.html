        Dan,
        Yeah, I think Rusty VB was pushing a well-known button but
I don't see why Japanese collectors shouldn't be able to buy what they
want. Think of the happy Yankees who've cleaned out dealerships in
South America.
        Last time I was in Japan I saw one well loved Beetle in Tokyo,
parked right in front of the Keio Plaza Hotel in Shinjuku. When you think 
of the inspections and maintenance grief the owner must have gone through 
(Gov't policy is you should buy a NEW car every 3 years, so they make is 
*d()*%d* hard to keep an old one- ) I say more power to 'em. I don't like 
the competition but there's no reason to colorize the issue. Plus the best
car museum/restraunt I've seen is in Japan :)

        Ben,
        I wouldn't sneak in a parts bus while fiancee isn't looking-
she should help!  I believe 1700/1800/2000 type IVs can be interchanged
on the '75s transmission- same case &amp; bolt pattern. But check the exhaust
ports I think they changed shape somewhere in there.- you may have to move 
or reproduce the donor's exhaust system.

        Jonathan, 
        TAKE IT EASY in the big wind. Like don't drive. Seriously.
Call your fiancee and tell her all about the parts bus YOU want, but
be careful! And don't spend any time in a mobile home!!

        Duncan,
        Less glamorous, but try the library for books on autofinishing
for the do-it-yourselfer, AND the professional. Around 600s in Dewey Decimal.

        Markus,
        I've seen a luxocar, a Jaguar coupe I think, with the radio mounted
sideways on the center console. Looked funny. Lots of CBs mount this way
though. Some states or police persons may give you grief for something that 
big on the dash, and duct tape isn't enough to hold it in an accident... use
metal fasteners at least.


        Happy Motoring!
        Bill
