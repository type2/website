Subject: Re: CV boot clamps

Matt, are you talking about the small clamps in the middle of the shaft?
I don't know if this is right or not and would like for someone to tell me,
but i just put on new C Vs and was told not to use a clamp at the center
of the shaft. They said that the boot fits so tight there that clamps are no
longer used. Someone let me know if this is wrong.  Morris
