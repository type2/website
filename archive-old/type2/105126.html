  Be careful with the 100 (highbeam) watt bulbs, they WILL overheat your
wireing and could melt down the highbeam switch. No problem with the 55
watt. Most H4 headlight bulbs come with 55/60 or 65 bulbs.

  I have H4 headlight bulbs from India with either flat or curved lens with
bulbs for under 10 dollars each for those that care

ronnie

ps. for those that care at least half of all new cars in the U S headlight
and/or tail light assemblies are made in India

Dave,

I'm running the 55/100W bulbs that I picked up from aircooled_dot_net.

They are unbelievably bright, no relays either.  Just plugged them in and
turned them on.  I use my high beams quite a bit and for extended lengths of
time with no ill effects.

The light pattern is awesome compared to the previous sealed beams.
