Subject: FS: VW &quot;Riviera&quot; Camper Bus 74' - $2000 Portland, Or

Posting for a friend. He recently moved to a 87 Vanagon that was bought from
a Wet Westie in Washington State.  I can tell you that this bus has been all
over the PNW and lots of camping.  Good bus. Contact him if you want to buy.
His name is Phil.  The engine is in the bus..FYI

Great, reliable camper with a fantastic engine. This engine has 16K miles on
it, is a 2.0L out of a Porsche 914, dual dellorto carbs, electronic
ignition, hydraulic lifters, etc. Basically this engine was built for a show
car and I ended up with it - it turned into a 100% reliable machine with
PLENTY of power. The guy that built the engine specializes in performance
engines and indicated that it was blue printed and had 150 HP.

All the camping gear works (pop top, stove, fridge). The only thing that
needs replacing is the hand pump for the water tank. I started some of the
body work and just never got to the finish sanding and painting phase. The
interior is in good shape and ready for camping.
