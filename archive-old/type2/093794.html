&lt;&lt; I've hunted and searched, plugged holes, made sure all my tin is there,

hoses hooked up correctly, etc. etc., and still the damn heat smells fumy

to me and gives me headaches (I think...).

Any oil leaking onto the exchangers...Either from the engine itself or
spillage from topping up? Also is the engine door seal sealing? Exhaust
from the muffler might be pulled into the engine compartment and
pumped through the heater...
