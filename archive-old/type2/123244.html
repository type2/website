Subject: RE: [T2] CO gauge for FI setup

Rick,

You might get an implied value, but it will never be close enough.

Narrow band O2 sensors swing across a certain voltage(about 1 volt) 
depending on whether the mixture is rich or lean.  No extrapolation of 
how much rich or lean though.

A wide band O2 sensor gives you a better indication, but the kits
run close to $400+ and still do not give you a proper CO number.

Air fuel ratio chart is here....hmm, well not any more...

Good luck, dave

&gt; I think you can use an O2 sensor and a digital multimeter to get an implied 
&gt; CO value based on O2, but I don't know exactly how it's done. Anyone know 
&gt; the setup for this?
