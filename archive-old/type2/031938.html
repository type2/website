When I saw the first post below I puzzled over the reference to the 
&quot;intake air preheating hose&quot;.  But, since the original poster didn't 
indicate a model year I figured it was just one of these Volkswagen 
variations I knew nothing about.

However, I *know* there's no &quot;air intake preheating hose&quot; on an '82; this 
sounds like the hose that goes through to the charcoal filter that's part 
of the fuel tank venting system.  If your charcoal filter is missing, and 
this hose is just dangling in space in front of the right rear wheel, 
then it's not doing a damn bit of good and you might as well remove it 
and block off the hole in the air filter box that this hose attaches 
to.  This setup would result in unfiltered air being introduced into the 
airstream, possibly shortening engine life.

As to the non-functional thermostat, this topic has been hashed over many 
times on the list.  The majority opinion is that running the engine this 
way only serves to delay warmup, again causing excess wear and tear on 
the engine.  Since the VW thermostat setup is designed to fail in the 
&quot;open&quot; (maximum cooling) position, there doesn't seem to be any good 
reason to not have it working properly.

&gt; &gt;Has anyone ever really understood the effectiveness of the &quot;intake air
&gt; &gt;preheating hose &quot; which goes through the tin and sucks dusty, cruddy air from
&gt; &gt;below the engine compartment, right where the back wheels kick up all the
&gt; &gt;dirt.

&gt; .....I have had my 2L 82 for three years and I run it with no air intake
&gt; hose and the thermostat wire is disconnected. This is the way the PO used
&gt; it so I have carried on with this set up. So far so good. If I am doing
&gt; harm will someone please let me know.
