I beg to differ on this.  The higher(or lower) the pressure, the more(or
less) fuel that will be sprayed into the manifold.  That's why one of
the first steps in testing the fuel injection is to check the fuel
pressure (bosch manual)

later,

&gt; Too much pressure to the injectors should not be a problem as long as the
&gt; injectors are not leaking.  The brain determines the length of time that the
&gt; injectors remain open, not the amount of pressure. Take a good look at your
&gt; cold start injector for leakage and proper operation. (thermo-time switch
&gt; operation)
