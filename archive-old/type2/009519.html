Chuck:

Before trying to start the Bus, you should do the following:

1) Change the oil.
2) Remove the spark plugs, put a teaspoon of motor oil in each plug hole.
3) Using a wrench on the pulley nut, spin the engine a few times to make
sure everything moves, then install the spark plugs.
4) Adjust the valves.
5) Replace all fuel lines (you may need to have the tank cleaned)
6) A complete tune-up might be a good idea.

As long as nothing was wrong when the Bus was parked, it should start up
now with a new battery.

Thank you!

 Dear Volks-
 	I've got one for all of you guys.  My buddy's aunt just past away and
 when they were cleaning out her farm house my buddy found her old 71 Bus
 in the barn.  His dad told him it has been sitting there for over 15
 years.  It is complete and oh so beautiful.  My question is.  How do we
 get it started?  It has been sitting for so long that the pistons are
 probably frozen.  How do we get it running without tearing the engine
 apart?  We were told to put mystry oil down the plug holes for a week and
 let it seep in and loosen the pistons.  Do you folks have any advice?
 
 thanks in advance
 
 Chuck
