&gt;
&gt;To add more fuel to the VW/Simpson's fire (so to speak), Marge's sisters
&gt;drive a Thing. I've seen it on two separate episodes.
&gt;
&gt;Do you think that Matt Groenig is a VW person? Hmmmm.
&gt;
&gt;
Somebody in the Simpsons animation dept must be into VWs. I've seen lots of
VWs in the background in the Simpsons, including a ghia in a parking lot
and several bugs and busses. Also, in one episode,  the camera pans up to
and holds for a few seconds on a couple of palm trees arranged in the VW
logo.

None of this is coincidence!
