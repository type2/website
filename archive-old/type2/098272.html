&gt; Can a T2 engine be expected to idle normally (900 RPM) with the points dwell

Charles, I have never tried to run one that far out, but IMHO the answer
would be &quot;NO!!!&quot;  I would bet money it would not idle at all, much less
&quot;well&quot; and would put a gentlemen's bet on it not starting/running at all.

Again, thank you for the equation on dwell.  I am OK at jack-leg stuff and
continuity checks, but beyond that, I get lost fast.
