Subject: RE: [T2] New concept van in Michelin Challenge with bus feel

Chris,

It was the Chicken &quot;WAR&quot;.  Article in &quot;life&quot; magazine many years 
ago.

Turns out(latter in life) that I worked for that company for 15 years.

They built a new set of offices and one of the things they showed 
when the dug all of their stuff out of storage was the original sign that 
said 

&quot;No Volkswagons Allowed&quot;  spelled exactly like that.

What was funny was that the original owner's grandson was seriously in to 
Porsche's(after he was born, that is)....

Tried to go find the copy of &quot;life magazine&quot; with the cover, but 
couldn't find it....hmmmmmm  maybe it was &quot;time&quot; magazine

Read all about it here

Cheers, dave

&gt; So are we still paying the high tariff on the European vans/trucks?
&gt; Wasn't it the Chicken Tariff or something like that?
