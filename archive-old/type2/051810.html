Subject: Re: [T2] 82 FI Pickup

Verify if you have fried the new relay. Look for discoloration of the
terminals from excess heat. Take the cover off and look for overheated
solder joints inside. If this is the case, it is likely that the fuel pump
is old and drawing excess amps. Listen to the pump when running. It should
be a very smooth hum. Any noise at all is indication of a problem from age
and wear. Veryify the amperage draw. Poor ground or connections could cause
that relay to click on and off. Srutinize all the wiring from and to the
relay. Verify all the connections are clean and tight. Even a poor battery
cable terminal could be the culprit here. I have never seen a computer draw
the kind of amps that would kill a relay. But a funky relay sure as hell
could glitch a computer. 

This is just speculation on the info given. If you give up on solving this,
let me know your price and I may buy that sucker from you. I want a PU too
bad to be rational, not.

&gt;Hi,

&gt;I am new to the list. The reason a joined is because my ´82 FI Pickup is 
&gt;not working properly, thought you guys might have some pointers for me.

&gt;What can cause this, is something destroying my doublerelay? Can it be the 
&gt;hole computerbox? Does any body have any Idea??
