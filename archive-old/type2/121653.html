Subject: OT: Anyone in the Tampa, St. Pete area?

This is terribly off-topic: If you live in or near Tampa, FL or the St. 
Pete area, can you please p-mail me? I am considering moving to that area 
soon and would like to ask some questions of someone who lives there and 
can answer a few questions.

Thanks,

Chris in VA
