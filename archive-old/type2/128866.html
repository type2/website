Subject: Re: [T2] friday question for the chemical engineers

&gt;&gt; Bus content: what do most people use in their bus...t1 or t4 and why.
&gt;&gt;
I have just started using 89 octane.  I recently moved my girl friend's 
plants, stereo and computer from Carbondale, Illinois to Bismarck, 
North Dakota (1140 miles).  I left her new home on Monday morning and 
had to teach on Tuesday morning so, obviously, I drove straight 
through.  I have a 76 with slightly oversize pistons, a Webcam, a 
progressive Weber, and the notorious Empi exhaust.  It runs very well 
(yes, I have all the VDO instruments) at 75 mph continuously.  I found 
on steep hills, however, with the CHT a hair under the 400 degree mark, 
that I got a slight ping.  I started using 89 octane and never heard it 
again.  A ping is pre-ignition and it can burn the valves and pistons 
so it's worth the extra few cents to eliminate it.

Jeff
