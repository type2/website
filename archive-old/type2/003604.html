Subject: The &quot;book&quot; of ideas, a disclaimer if it helps

On the chance that one of the issues is liability associated with advice or
design (the architectural field is REAL touchy about that one), I offer the
great disclaimer written for me by the gracious Chris Huff, a lawyer listee,
and included on the engine dolly plan, in the archives.

I'm 100% with Art Lynch on this one.  This list is such a good thing, so
rare and worth keeping open and helpful.

On the bus side, has anybody made a bumper out of 4x4 tube steel?  I have a
chunk left over from a demo at work, and it sure looks doable to me.  Not
real VW but better than what I've got.
