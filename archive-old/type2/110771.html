Subject: Final drive play?

(forwarded from Steve Blackham)

Greetings to all in type 2 land.  I have been away for some time.

I am currently replacing the seals on the final drive of my 87 while
I have the tranny out for clutch replacement.  I notice that the
final drive shaft has a back and forth play of .03 in.    Is this
acceptable or should I take it in for an adjustment?
