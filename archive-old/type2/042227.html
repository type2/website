&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been pretty much a lurker so far because, well, I haven't actually
&gt; driven my Westy yet. Here's the scoop. It ran fine when I looked at it. Then
&gt; I bought it, had it towed home (not because it couldn't be driven but because
&gt; I was in NJ and it was in Philly and the city was about to tow it in their
&gt; effort to clean up for the Republican Convention later this month... forgive
&gt; me I digress!). So it was towed here. I have a knack for buying VWs that run
&gt; when I look at them and then stop running as soon as they arrive here!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I replaced the ignition switch (which was bad when I bought it), and
&gt; then it wouldn't start. Turned over fine, just never caught. Then I went on
&gt; vacation to the UK. When I came back there were stickers on it that it would
&gt; be towed in 24 hours if not removed from the parking lot (condo). Not being
&gt; able to start it, and new to all this, what did I do? I had it towed to the
&gt; only local aircooled shop I knew of.

How long was this vacation?  Days? Weeks? Years?  Days or weeks, your vacation
did nothing to worsen things.  Years?  Might have a bit o' rust in the
cylinders and that would cause the engine not to turn over completely.  Did
you try to start it upon your return?

&gt; They say the engine won't turn all the way and that I'm probably looking at a
&gt; rebuild job. They seem like nice people, though I have no experience with
&gt; them, but I'm hesitant to go the rebuild route because of the $$$--they
&gt; haven't given me a price yet. They said they would pull the engine and try
&gt; and determine the source of the problem and then give me a better idea of
&gt; what I'm looking at. I'm going to talk to them tomorrow.

If they pull the engine, they're going to be into your pocket for about $300
with no repairs.  One usually does NOT need to remove the engine to determine
why it will not turn over.  Off the top of my head I can think of only a
couple three reasons why an engine would not rotate.  Broken cam or sheared
timing rivets.  Dropped rod.  Dropped valve or valve seat.  Broken crankshaft.
 The above mentioned rust.  Of those, only the rust would occur with the
engine not running.  The others only occur while the engine is operating and
all are accompanied by expensive noises.

Removing the valve covers will determine the state of the valve gear.  Valves
not moving while the crankshaft is means sheared timing rivets (the rivets
that hold the cam gear to the cam.) or broken cam.  Valves at a different
height than the others probably means broken valve or dropped valve seat. 
Broken crankshaft does require the removal and disassembly of the motor the
verify.  Same with dropped rod.  However, remember that each of these fail
only when the engine is running.  And all except the crank failure will make,
as I said, expen$ive noises.  You would have NO doubt that it was seriously ill.

&gt; So, what should I ask? Is it reasonable that the bus ran fine, was towed
&gt; here, I replaced the ignition switch, it wouldn't start, was towed there, and
&gt; now needs a new engine?? I guess stranger things have happened when it comes
&gt; to VWs :~)

As mentioned above, no, it is not reasonable.  It ran.  You parked it and
replaced the ignition switch.  It would not start.  The problem is the
ignition switch install.  You have a crossed wire somewhere.  A $20 multimeter
and the wiring diagram from either Bentley or Thom's wiring page and about
half an hour would fix it as well as it was when you parked it.  Might need
the battery charged/replaced as well.  MAKE 'EM SHOW YOU!  

&gt; 
&gt; Any advice appreciated. I really don't know what to do from here. I've
&gt; started doing some work on my 65 Bug, but no engine work per se (well, I did
&gt; pull the carb and replace it). Mostly brakes, fuel lines, etc.)


As another mentioned, you need to find another mechanic.  It really sound like
an electrical problem.  R&amp;R'ing the motor might cure it, but that repair will
be incidental to the engine removal.  They will do the work (maybe) then have
to find the real problem.  The alternative is to get yourself smart (and
confident!) and have them SHOW you that the engine doesn't turn over.  Reading
Muir is a good way to develop the beginning of VW Knowledge.  (However, keep
the source of your enlightenment to yourself.  Most mechanics hold John Muir
in low regard.)
