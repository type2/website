&gt; Well, the stock oil pressure new and 20 years ago might have been
&gt; 2.1-6.4 psi, however experience tells me different in this situation.
&gt; A bit ago I swapped an origional switch with a new VDO dual switch.
&gt; Suddenly the oil pressure light came one a lot more at idle than
&gt; before. Nothing else changed. Not even the weight of oil. So either
&gt; the new switch was off, however it read ~10psi on a vdo pressure
&gt; gauge. or the old switch had become a lot harder to trip.

This is just what should have happened. Don't forget that the switch trips
at the threshold or below. The old (OEM) switch comes on at under 6.4 psi.
The new one comes on at under 11 psi. Your oil pressure at idle was 10 psi.
With the old switch, you never got the light because it trips at below 6.4
psi. When you switched to the VDO dual sender, you get the light on at ~10
psi, because the VDO sender trips the switch at 11 psi or below.  I don't
think anything is broken or malfunctioning in this scenario.

&gt; The best way to tell exactly what pressure he has is not to rely on an
&gt; old sensor. He needs to go to his mechanic and ask him to put a true
&gt; pressure gauge on the port to determine what the real pressure is. I
&gt; wouldn't risk the possibility one way or the other with anything other
&gt; than a quality mechanical gauge in this case. Good luck with it &amp; let
&gt; us all know your progress.

I'm a fan of mechanical gauges. Stewart-Warner make bulletproof ones.
