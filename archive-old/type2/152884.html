Subject: Re: [T2] Lurch has done it again - diagnosis

Something's not right here.

My diagnosis is broken crank.

I can get the pulley to wiggle back and forth (axial direction) about 8 
mm (I'm trying to get the damn thing off).  I can move it in the radial 
direction about 1 mm.  At the same time, the flywheel is stock still 
(flywheel lock is installed).  Something tells me they should move as 
one.

Nothing more than you really need.
What it takes to get you where you want to go.
