Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Motor into 71??

Mark,

Although I've never done this and can only speculate, here are my thoughts:

You'll have two choices for your cooling shroud:
Stock type 4 cooling shroud, or converting the engine to upright cooling 
(type 1 style). For the latter I would recommend this site- 
http://www.tunacan_dot_net/t4/index.shtml
It seems to me that keeping the type 4 cooling system could mean that you 
would have to leave out a couple peices of the underside cooling tin (or 
make mounts), whereas converting to upright cooling could end up costing 
more for the conversion tin.
Another thing to take into account is the motor mount location: I'm not sure 
what the differences are between type 1 bus and type 4 bus motor mount 
locations, but that would be something to keep in mind.
You'll also need to modify your wiring harness to accomodate the FI system. 
I found great (color-coded, too) schematics of later model buses at my 
public library and you might too. Those should help you figure out what 
changes will need to be made to your electrical system, and they only cost 
me ~$1.50 for the copies :)

'Hope that helps! Good luck!
