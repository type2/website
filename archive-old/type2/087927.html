Well,  the rebuild on the top end has been great.  Great power, great
gas mileage, great running all the way around.  At about 1200 to 1500
miles on the rebuild, I decided I would change the oil and go with
synthetic this time.  Changed the oil and let it run for about 10
minutes or so.  Ran fine and nothing was to be questioned.  Walked
around to open the back hatch up and get something and the bus suddenly
died.  No funny sounds or pops or cracks or anything.  Just stopped as
if I had turned the ignition off.  I tried to start it a few times but
no luck.  Well, talked to a few people for some advice as to where to
look and what to suspect.  While turning the engine over by hand, I
noticed that the rotor was not turning at all.  Took the distributor out
and reseated it and the rotor started turning as usual.  Huh?  The
distributor was securely fastened to the case at the time that this
happened.  So I tried to start it again and nothing.  Would crank over
at about 20rpm's and the dwell meter was showing about 49 to 50 during
this time.  Items tested so far...


Double Relay is good
Fuel pump is good
Injectors are good and putting out nice flow
Have spark at the dist cap and the plugs
135 Compression all the way around
Valves checked
Timing sequence on the cap checked 15+ times
Distributor is seated correctly
Rotor tested good
Tried spare AFM with no difference 
 
With distributor in and rotated a fair amount counter clockwise
(advance), I can get it to start for about 1 second with full throttle.
Then it backfires and wont start again like that unless I let it sit for
a minute.  Dist cap looks ok and so do the points.  At TDC the rotor has
been confirmed as pointing to the notch on the dist for #1.  There are
no vacuum hoses that I can tell that are either disconnected or not
connected firmly in place.  Can anyone shed some light on this issue?
Any help is much appreciated and thanks for those who have helped so
far.
