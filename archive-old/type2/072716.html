Subject: Let's not let this happen again if we can

I didn't sleep a wink last night thinking about this Kirtsin situation.

The world is not the same place it use to be.  When I was younger (35 years
ago), the world seemed to be a wonderful, exciting place to explore  (then
in my 62 beetle).  Maybe there were hazards out there but I was oblivious
to them.

I would like to offer a safe haven to any and all fellow travellers out there.
If your in the Utah area, my driveway (and more) is available.  I don't
want to have to read about another Kirstin.  Please feel comfortable
staying at &quot;Camp Blackham&quot;.

Also I have 35 years experience and tool accumulation with VW's. (plus a
garage full of parts)  If you're just starting out with an ancient Bus or
Vanagon and are in the Utah area drop me a line.  Maybe I can help you get
it in a reliable shape before you take it out to see the world.

Have fun

But please be safe
