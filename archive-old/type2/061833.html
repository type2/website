Ok volks. Here is our trip report from our trip from coast to coast to coast
in September this year.  I hope you all find it interesting. Believe me , I
could have written twice as much. When I wrote it I did it in all caps so my
family could read it easier (we're all blind) so please dont write and tell me
what a bad boy I am.  For my new years resolution I am going to try to never
write to the list in all caps again.  Best wishes for the coming year........

NOVEMBER 30. 1998          WELL VOLKS, IT^ÒS THAT TIME AGAIN. THIS YEAR WE DID
SOMETHING WE NEVER
THOUGHT WE^ÒD DO. DRIVE OUR 1972 VOLKSWAGEN ^ÓWESTY^Ô CAMPER FROM FLORIDA TO
CALIFORNIA AND
BACK AGAIN. WE PLANNED TO LEAVE AT 1 AM SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 6.  BUT I KEPT
FARTING AROUND DOING
SOMETHING I^ÒD FORGOTTEN TO DO. FINALLY AT 1 AM MONDAY THE WIFE SAID ^ÓTHAT^ÒS
IT, WE^ÒRE LEAVING
NOW! IF WE DON^ÒT WE^ÒLL NEVER GET OUTA HERE^Ô. SHE WAS RIGHT. YOU COULD GIVE ME
ANOTHER MONTH
TO GET READY AND I^ÒD STILL BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING I FORGOT THAT I DIDN^ÒT
NEED.  ONLY A WEEK
BEFORE I HAD HAD (STUTTER) THE ENGINE OUT AND IN BITS IN THE DRIVEWAY BECAUSE
IT WAS LEAKING
OIL AND MAKING A FUNNY (STRANGE NOT HAHA) NOISE.  AFTER A LOT OF LATE NIGHTS I
HAD IT UP AND
RUNNING BY SATURDAY THE 5TH.  STILL LEAKED OIL THOUGH.........

	WE STARTED OUT ON MONDAY SEPTEMBER 7. 1998 AT 2AM FROM OUR PLACE IN SUNNY
SOUTH
FLORIDA AND WANTED TO GO TO A VOLKSWAGEN CAMPING WEEKEND IN PHOENIX,
ARI(D)ZONA (AS THEY
CALL IT THERE, GETS HOT) STARTING FRIDAY NIGHT, SEPTEMBER 11.  WE GUESSED IT
WAS ABOUT 2500
MILES THERE AND WE HAD 5 DAYS TO DO IT, SO WE FIGURED WE HAD TO DO AT LEAST
500 MILES EVERY
DAY FOR EACH OF THE 5 DAYS TO MAKE IT IN TIME (LUCKY I^ÒM GOOD AT MATHS).  AS
YOU CAN IMAGINE A
26 YEAR OLD BUS DOES NOT LIKE TO GO MUCH OVER 65, SO WE WERE DOING MOSTLY 60
OR LESS, KEEPING A
CLOSE EYE ON THE TEMPERATURE. WE DROVE ABOUT 10 HOURS  THAT DAY AND STILL
DIDN^ÒT GET OUT OF
FLORIDA (IT^ÒS A BIG STATE). WE SPENT OUR FIRST NIGHT AT FALLING WATERS STATE
PARK IN CHIPLEY, FL.,
$12. WE^ÒD NEVER SLEPT IN THE BACK OF THIS LITTLE BUS BEFORE SO WE HAD FUN
TRYING TO SLEEP WITH
EACH OTHERS ARMS SMACKING US IN THE FACE. TAKES A BIT OF GETTING USED TO. BUT
WE WERE SO
TIRED I THINK WE COULD^ÒVE SLEPT IN A MINI.

	NEXT MORNING WE LEFT BRIGHT AND EARLY ABOUT 6 AM GETTING ON I-10, THE ROAD
THAT GOES
FROM COAST TO COAST ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE COUNTRY. A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER
WE CROSSED
OUR FIRST STATE LINE, INTO ALABAMA. I SAY THAT YOU CAN TELL A LOT BY A STATE^ÒS
WELCOME CENTER
USUALLY FOUND JUST OVER THE STATE LINE.  ALABAMA HAS A BEAUTY. LARGE AND CLEAN
WITH LOTS OF
PARKING AND A NICE VISITOR CENTER. ALABAMA IS A VERY GREEN STATE WITH LOTS OF
TREES ETC. BUT
PEOPLE SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. I COULDN^ÒT UNDERSTAND THEM OR THEM ME.
AFTER A COUPLE OF
HOURS WE GOT TO MISSISSIPPI THEN 2 HOURS LATER INTO LOUISIANA WHERE WE WENT
OVER THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER. WE HAD ARRANGED TO MEET A FELLOW CAMPER GOING TO ARIZONA IN
DALLAS, TEXAS
SO HEADED NORTH HERE FOR A BIT TO MEET UP WITH HIM. WE STOPPED FOR THE NIGHT
AT A LOVELY PLACE
NAMED NATCHITOCHES (PRONOUNCED NAK-A-DISH. WE INVENTED THE LANGUAGE, THESE
YANKS SCREWED
IT UP, ROYALLY). THIS PLACE IS ONE OF THE OLDEST SURVIVING SETTLEMENTS OF THE
NATIVE AMERICAN
INDIANS IN THE COUNTRY. AFTER WALKING AROUND IN THE MORNING WE ATE OUR HAM
ROLLS (OLD
HABITS DIE HARD) BY THE RIVER.  HAVING SPENT MORE TIME THERE THAN WE SHOULD IT
WAS TIME TO
GET BACK ON THE ROAD AGAIN.  WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN DALLAS BY 4 ON
WEDNESDAY THE 9TH. WE
DROVE NON-STOP FOR HOURS AND GOT TO DALLAS ABOUT 7:30.  THE GUY WE ARRANGED TO
MEET (DAVID SCHWARZE) HAD
WAITED FOR US. WE^ÒD NEVER MET HIM BEFORE AND I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS IN CASE HE
WAS AN IDIOT.
LUCKILY HE WAS A REAL NICE GUY AND WE GOT ON SWELL. WE BOTH HAD OUR CB^ÒS WITH
US SO FROM
THERE ON WE HAD SOMEONE ELSE TO TALK TO. HE HAD DONE THIS TRIP A FEW TIMES SO
HE TALKED AND
WE LISTENED.  ALTHOUGH WE^ÒD ALREADY DRIVEN FOR ABOUT 7 HOURS THAT DAY WE DID
ANOTHER 7 THAT
NIGHT TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME. HE^ÒD WORKED ALL DAY (HE^ÒS A COMPUTER
PROGRAMMER FOR NASA  OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HE SAID HE^ÒD HAVE TO KILL US IF HE TOLD US) SO BY
MIDNIGHT WE WERE ALL
DEAD (NO HE DIDN^ÒT TELL US, DEAD AS IN TIRED). BRIGHT AND EARLY ON THE 10TH WE
WERE UP AND
RUNNING AGAIN. NOW ALL THE GREENERY WAS GONE AND THERE WAS NOTHING BUT FLAT,
DEAD DESSERT.
TUMBLE WEEDS WERE THE ONLY THINGS AROUND. THEM AND LOTS OF THEM OIL PUMPERS.
OH AND LOTS
OF HEAT, LOTS AND LOTS (WE HAD NO AIR-CONDITIONING. HE DID). TEXAS IS HUGE,
AND I MEAN HUGE.
ITS ABOUT 820 MILES ACROSS, AND MOST OF IT IS THE SAME, AT LEAST DOWN SOUTH.
EL PASO IS RIGHT
ON THE MEXICAN BORDER AND YOU COULD EASILY SEE THE HOUSES IN MEXICO FROM THE
ROAD. SHORTLY
THEREAFTER WE CROSSED OUR SECOND TIME ZONE AS WE WENT INTO NEW MEXICO. ANOTHER
BEAUTIFUL
WELCOME CENTER COMPLETE WITH WARNINGS ABOUT RATTLESNAKES BEING EVERYWHERE
(WARNING -
WARNING). COINCIDENTALLY (GET YOUR DIARIES OUT), SEP 10TH WAS, IS, AND ALWAYS
WILL BE MY
BIRTHDAY. SO I HAD A 25 HOUR 38TH BIRTHDAY. WE STAYED AT A LOVELY CAMPSITE
THERE FOR THE
AMAZING PRICE OF $6 A NIGHT. COMPLETE WITH HOT TUB AND POOL.
  
	IN THE A OF M WE MADE EGGS AND BACON AND TOAST AND AFTER THE WIFE WASHED UP
AND PUT
AWAY ALL THE DISHES WE DEPARTED FOR ARIZONA. NOT LONG TILL WE STARTED TO SEE
LARGE CACTUS
EVERYWHERE, AND DID I MENTION THE HEAT? HOT DURING THE DAY, NICE AT NIGHT
THOUGH.  ARIZONA
DOESN^ÒT FOLLOW DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME SO FORWARD THE CLOCKS WENT AGAIN. AT 8 PM
WE FOUND
THE PARKING LOT WHERE THE BUSES WERE MEETING FOR THE CARAVAN TO THE CAMPSITE
THE NEXT
MORNING. WE MADE IT.  WE WERE AWOKEN (MY WORD) BY THE SOUND OF PEOPLE
EVERYWHERE AT ABOUT 6
AM ON SAT 12TH.  THERE WERE DOZENS OF BUSES PARKED AROUND US AND COMING INTO
THE LOT AT THE
RATE OF ABOUT 1 A MINUTE.  BY 9AM THERE MUST HAVE BEEN 2-300 OF US ALL
CARAVANING TO AN OLD
GOLD MINE WHERE WE WERE GOING TO BE BUS BUDDIES FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS.  I^ÒD
NEVER SEEN SO MANY
VW^ÒS IN ONE PLACE IN ALL MY LIFE. AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE IN FRONT AND BEHIND
THERE WERE V-DUBS,
THE OLDEST BEING A 1953 BARNDOOR FROM TEXAS AND THE NEWEST BEING A 1998 NEW
BUG.

	THE NEXT 2 DAYS WERE SPENT CAMPING AND JOINING IN THE FESTIVITIES IT LOOKED
TO ME LIKE
A BIG MUDDY FIELD SURROUNDED BY CAVES. IN THE AWARDS CEREMONY WE WON THE LONG
DISTANCE
AWARD, 2509 MILES. PROUD HAPPY CAMPERS WE WERE. ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON WE LEFT
THERE AND
HEADED NORTH TOWARDS THE GRAND CANYON TRAVELING ALONG ROUTE 66 IN FLAGSTAFF
ARIZONA (AS
THE SONG GOES). WE SPENT THAT NIGHT IN THE FLINTSTONES CAMPGROUND. WE HAD OUR
PICTURE TAKEN
WITH A HUGE FRED, WHAT A NEAT PLACE.  IN THE MORNING THERE WASN^ÒT A CLOUD IN
THE SKY. NOT ONE.
IT WENT DOWN TO THE COLDEST TEMPERATURE SO FAR, ABOUT 60. A FEW MILES DOWN THE
ROAD WAS
THE GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK. WHILE DRIVING AROUND IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER
PARK OUT WEST.
THEN YOU SEE THE PARK AND VIEW SIGNS. AFTER PARKING AND WALKING THROUGH SOME
BUSHES YOU
COME ACROSS THE EDGE OF THE BIGGEST HOLE I^ÒVE EVER SEEN. SO BIG THAT YOU
CANNOT FOCUS ON THE
BOTTOM AND SIDES, A MILE DEEP AND A COUPLE ACROSS. UNBELIEVABLE........  FROM
THERE IT WAS ON INTO
UTAH, ACROSS ANOTHER TIME ZONE.  HERE GOES THEM CLOCKS, BACK AGAIN - EXCUSE ME
SIR, WHAT TIME
IS IT...........

	UTAH IS VERY NICE BUT BARREN. HUNDREDS OF MILES OF NOTHING BUT ROCKS OF EVERY
SHAPE AND
COLO(U)R. IT^ÒS WHERE THEY FILM A LOT OF THEM WESTERNS YOU SEE ON TV.  WE
DIDN^ÒT SEE A CLOUD IN
THE SKY ALL DAY. FROM THERE IT WAS SOUTH WEST AND DOWN TO LAS VEGAS, NEVADA.
WHAT A PLACE.
LIGHTS AND CASINOS EVERYWHERE. A BIG CITY IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, WITH ONE
MAIN SOURCE OF
INCOME - MONEY. THE NEXT MORNING WE STARTED TO DRIVE TO CALIFORNIA WHEN WE
DECIDED TO STOP
FOR BREAKFAST AT A CASINO. THEY HAD PRIME RIB WITH SALAD AND MASHED AND PEAS
FOR $5, 24 HOURS
A DAY. SO THAT WAS IT FOR ME. 9 O^ÒCLOCK IN THE MORNING EATING A 12 OUNCE PIECE
OF PRIME RIB WITH
2 VEG. THE WIFE HAD PANCAKES FOR 4 BUCKS. I ATE MY PRIME RIB THEN HALF HER
PANCAKES. NO WONDER
WE ARE GETTING A TAD CHUBBY (AS MY MOTHER RECENTLY POINTED OUT).  THAT DAY WAS
THE HOTTEST
WE ENCOUNTERED ON OUR TRIP.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE DRANK WE WERE STILL
THIRSTY. I THOUGHT
THAT DAY WAS NEVER GONNA END. IN THE EARLY EVENING WE ARRIVED IN CALIFORNIA.
WE ACTUALLY
MADE IT, I NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD.

	WE DROVE THROUGH THE MOJAVE DESERT (NO WONDER IT WAS SO HOT) AND ON THROUGH
SAN
BERNARDINO (MORE ROUTE 66) AND DOWN TO LOS ANGELES.  1ST STOP, HOLLYWOOD.
WALKED DOWN
HOLLYWOOD AND VINE, LOOKED AT THE HANDPRINTS AND STARS STARS (INTENTIONAL)
ALONG THE
BOULEVARD. NEXT STOP BEVERLY HILLS. HAD TO LOOK AT THE BIG HOUSES AND TAKE OUR
PICTURE WITH
THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN.  LASTLY BEFORE HEADING TOWARDS THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY
AND THE BEACH
WE WENT TO THE HOLLYWOOD POLICE STATION. WHY YOU ASK? BECAUSE THE WIFE WORKS
AT THE
HOLLYWOOD POLICE STATION IN HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA. SO WE STOPPED TO SAY HI TO THE
COPS AT THE
HOLLYWOOD POLICE STATION IN HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA. THEY DIDN^ÒT BELIEVE THERE
WAS A
HOLLYWOOD FLORIDA SO AFTER PRODUCING SOME POLICE ID WE WERE IN WITH THE LOCAL
5-0.  AFTER
DRIVING DOWN TO THE BEACH AND AROUND FOR A BIT WE DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO GET
OUT OF DODGE
AND GO SOMEWHERE QUIET. THE TRAFFIC DOWN THERE IS TERRIBLE. AND IT DOESN^ÒT LET
UP 24 HOURS A
DAY. WHERE ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE GOING? THE WIFE SPENT HALF OF THE NEXT DAY
SLEEPING WHILE I
DROVE NORTH TOWARDS SAN FRANCISCO. WE STOPPED AT THE SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST
WHERE WE
FOUND THE OLDEST LIVING THINGS ON THE PLANET. 3000 YEAR OLD GIANT TREES. THE
BIGGEST IS CALLED
GENERAL SHERMAN AND IS 102 FEET AROUND AT THE BASE WITH BARK 31 INCHES THICK.
I THOUGHT MY
POOR BUS WAS GONNA DIE GOING UP AND DOWN THE MOUNTAINS TO GET THERE. FROM
THERE IT WAS ON
UP TO NAPA (VINO COUNTRY) WHERE WE WERE GOING TO STAY WITH FRIENDS.  WHILST
STAYING WITH
THEM WE TOURED THE WINERIES AND SAN FRANCISCO, THE GOLDENGATE BRIDGE AND HAD
LUNCH AT PIER
39 AND FISHERMAN^ÒS WHARF. THEY HAD PICKED UP A HAMMOND ORGAN WHICH WE THINK
WAS MADE IN
THE SAME YEAR I WAS. THEY INSISTED THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT SO I MADE ROOM AND
LOADED IT IN.
THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR ALL OUR STUFF AND US BEFORE THAT. NOW WE HAD TO MOVE
TONS OF STUFF
FROM THE BACK TO THE FRONT WHEN WE WANTED TO SLEEP AND VICKI-VERKI WHEN WE
WANTED TO
DRIVE. CRAZY. WE LEFT THEM AND HEADED NORTH EAST TOWARDS NEVADA AGAIN, MORE
PRIME RIB, BUT
FOR DINNER THIS TIME. SPENT THE NIGHT THERE AND EARLY NEXT MORNING (JUST AS
THE SUN WAS
RISING) DROVE NORTH TO OREGON. MY EXTREMITIES WERE SO COLD I COULDN^ÒT FEEL
THEM ANY MORE
(WHAT EXTREMITIES THE WIFE SAID). AT THIS POINT I WAS WISHING I^ÒD DONE MORE TO
STOP THE AIR
COMING IN THE FRONT OF THE BUS. ALL THAT AIR IS WELCOME WHEN ITS 90-100
DEGREES. NOT AT 40!

	FROM OREGON WE DROVE WEST INTO IDAHO, WHERE THE POTATOES COME FROM. WE SAW
TRUCKS
AND TRUCKS FULL OF POTATOES. IDAHO WAS A WONDERFUL PLACE LOADED WITH FARMS AND
FARMHOUSES, NICE AND QUIET. AFTER A GOOD DAYS DRIVE THROUGH IDAHO WE ARRIVED
IN WYOMING
HOME OF YOGI BEAR, OLD FAITHFUL AND YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK.  HERE WE SAW
MOOSE AND
BUFFALO AND DEER. WE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT HERE AND CAMP OUT WITH WHAT
SEEMED LIKE
HUNDREDS OF OTHERS IN THE COLD.  THIS WAS THE COLDEST WE WENT THROUGH. IT WENT
DOWN TO 29
DEGREES THAT NIGHT AND WE HAD NO HEAT AT ALL, AAAHHHHHHH-CHHOOOOOO.  I STAYED
AWAKE MOST
OF THE NIGHT LOOKING OUT THE STEAMED UP WINDOW WAITING FOR THE SUN TO COME UP.
THE SUN
FINALLY DID COME UP AND WHAT A NICE DAY IT WAS. WE DROVE NORTH THROUGH THE
PARK INTO
MONTANA WHERE WE WENT INTO SHOPS BUILT TOTALLY OUT OF TREE LOGS, HUGE LOG
CABINS. WE SAW
LOTS OF BOILING WATER RUNNING DOWN THE RIVERS HEATED BY THE VOLCANIC ACTION
UNDERGROUND.
BY THE AFTERNOON IT STARTED TO RAIN AND WE SAT FOR AN HOUR EATING OUR HAM
ROLLS (WE LIKE
HAM ROLLS) WAITING FOR OLD FAITHFUL TO GO OFF, WHICH IT DID, EVENTUALLY. HOT
BOILING WATER
SHOOTING 100 FEET OR MORE INTO THE AIR. AFTER THAT EXCITEMENT WE LEFT THERE
AND HEADED WEST
UNTIL WE GOT TO CODY, WYOMING WHERE WE JUST MANAGED TO CATCH THE END OF AN OLD
WEST
SHOOTOUT  AND HAVE OUR PICS TAKEN WITH THE COWBOYS.  WE SPENT THAT NIGHT  BY
THE BUFFALO
BILL LAKE. VERY NICE.

	FROM THERE IT WAS ON TO SOUTH DAKOTA TO SEE THE PRESIDENTS FACES CARVED IN
THE SIDE OF
A MOUNTAIN. ANOTHER NICE PLACE, AND FREE. OUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK.  YOU
SHOULD^ÒVE SEEN
EVERYONE LOOKING AT US. ME WITH MY AMERICAN OUTFIT ON (BIG FLAG SHIRT AND
MOTHER MADE
SHORTS) AND OUR CHRISTMAS HATS. NOT BAD FOR A LIMEY EH I TOLD EVERYONE
......WE ALSO SAW SOME
REAL COWBOYS ON HORSES PLAYING WITH THEIR BULLOCKS. FROM THERE IT WAS DUE EAST
TO MITCHELL,
SOUTH DAKOTA.  THE WIFE WANTED TO SEE THE CORN PALACE. A BUILDING BUILT 50
YEARS AGO AND
DECORATED INSIDE AND OUT WITH MILLIONS OF EARS OF CORN.  MUST TAKE THEM MONTHS
TO DO IT.
THEY CHANGE IT EVERY YEAR.  THEN IT WAS OFF TO IDAHO WHERE WHILE WAITING FOR
OUR PIZZA TO
COOK WE FOUND SOME GREAT SHIRTS IN A GOODWILL STORE FOR 90 CENTS EACH.
INCLUDLING
(DELIBERATE, NO TYPO) A CORN PALACE SWEAT SHIRT FOR THE WIFE AND A BIG STRIPED
YELLOW AND
BLACK IOWA SHIRT  THAT MADE ME LOOK LIKE A BIG BUMBLE BEE.  AFTER PIZZA (YUM)
IT WAS FURTHER
EASTY IN OUR WESTY TO MINNESOTA WHERE WE STAYED WITH A GUY I WORKED ON THE
SHIPS WITH 15
YEARS AGO. HE LIVES IN A VERY EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBO(U)RHOOD IN WHICH I TOOK GREAT
DELIGHT IN
CHANGING MY OIL (SYNTHETIC) OUT IN THE STREET. I WAS VERY SURPRISED NO-ONE
CALLED THE COPS.
FROM THERE IT WAS OFF TO WISCONSIN (THE CHEESE STATE) TO STAY WITH ANOTHER GUY
I WORKED
WITH 15 YEARS AGO. THE NEXT MORNING WE LEFT THERE AND HEADED SOUTH INTO
ILLINOIS. WE DROVE
RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF CHICAGO (NOT MY KINDA TOWN) WHICH WAS A MISTAKE AS
THE TRAFFIC
WAS ATROCIOUS, BUT AT LEAST I CAN SAY I DID IT. IT ALSO GAVE ME A CHANCE TO
TAKE THE ORGAN
HOME AS THAT IS WHERE THEY WERE MADE.
 
	WE NEEDED TO GET DOWN TO TENNESSEE FOR ANOTHER VW SHOW SO WE DROVE AND DROVE
AND
DROVE, THROUGH INDIANA, OHIO, KENTUCKY AND FINALLY INTO TENNESSEE. WE GOT
THERE A TAD
EARLIER THAN EXPECTED SO WE SPENT SOME TIME VISITING DOLLYWOOD, DOLLY PARTON^ÒS
THEME PARK.
WE DROPPED IN TO NORTH CAROLINA TO STAY WITH ANOTHER FRIEND FOR A DAY THEN
DROVE BACK
ACROSS THE SMOKEY MOUNTAINS INTO TENNESSEE FOR THE VW CAMPING AND SHOW
WEEKEND. MORE
CRAZY ANTICS WENT ON THERE THE LEAST OF WHICH WAS THE WIFE DRIVING THE BUS
AROUND THE
CAMPGROUND WITH A GENERATOR ON THE ROOF AND ME PLAYING ROCKY TOP (STATE SONG)
ON THE ORGAN.

THAT WAS A FIRST FOR EVERYONE. OF COURSE WE WERE FAMOUS AFTER THAT AND LOTS OF
PEOPLE
STOPPED BY OUR HOUSE TO SEE THE MUSICAL BUS.

	THEN IT WAS ON THE ROAD AGAIN HEADING SOUTH THROUGH NORTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA
AND
FINALLY BACK INTO FLORIDA WHERE WE GOT WARM AGAIN. IT WASN^ÒT LONG BEFORE WE
WERE WISHING
IT WAS COOLER........HAHA.  WE DROVE DOWN TO CHERYL^ÒS PARENTS FOR A NIGHT THEN
ON THE LAST 250
MILE DRIVE BACK HOME TO HOLLYWOOD. WE GOT HOME AT 6 PM ON OCTOBER 6. OUR DOGS
(3) AND BIRDS
(9) WERE STILL ALIVE AND THE HOUSE(S) WERE STILL STANDING. AS WAS THE GRASS IN
OUR BACK YARD, 3
FEET HIGH IN SOME SPOTS................   WE MADE IT...............

	BOTTOM LINE IS WE DROVE 8905 MILES IN 29 DAYS 16 HOURS. DROVE THROUGH 25
STATES. WENT
FROM TEMPS OF OVER 100 DEGREES TO BELOW FREEZING. SPENT MOST NIGHTS IN THE
BUS, A FEW NIGHTS
AT PEOPLES HOUSES AND NOT ONE NIGHT IN A MOTEL (CHEAP). NOT ONCE DID THE BUS
NOT START OR DIE
ON US. NO FLAT TIRES, NO PROBLEMS AT ALL. GUESS I^ÒM A BETTER MECHANIC THAN I
THOUGHT. THE NEXT
DAY THE WIFE WENT TO WORK AND I FOUGHT WITH THE GRASS. WE WILL DO IT AGAIN IM
SURE, IN THE
SAME BUS. BUT NEXT TIME WE^ÒLL TAKE 3 MONTHS AND HIT EVERY STATE.........WANNA
COME WITH US?  :)
