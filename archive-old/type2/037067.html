Another thing to consider that was pointed out to me by the venerable Mr
hoover...

there is a hole/slot in the distributor that lines up with a slot/hole in
the case for the purpouse of splash oiling from the crankcase.  If your
dizzy is turned too much, these wont line up and you wont get any oil in
there and it'll wear out a lot quicker.

This is from teh foggy recesses of my memory so check it out and see what
you think...
