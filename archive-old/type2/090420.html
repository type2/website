Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust stud question and carb info needed 

Steve,

Before you tap, tho... do try to thread in the 8x8 stud.  If it fits you
win!  This is like line-boring a case.  If you must, you must, but you
only get so many.  If you go to the 8x9 and it pulls, I don't *think*
there is an 8x10 oversize to go to and the head is therefore dead, unless
you want to fill the hole with weld, then drill and tap it.

This is the sort of job that I generally leave to my machinist along with
my other mechanical nightmares :-)  For my opinion, see:

altho since you got the old stud out, you are in trritory I usually do
not enter.

&gt; &gt; Sorry... You can do it safely in place.  It is a blind hole.
