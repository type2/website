Subject: Procedure: Replacing the trans main shaft oil seal
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990715202310.12869A-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

Since I just recently replaced the main shaft oil seal in my transmission 
and it's fresh in my mind, I thought I'd post the procedure for the archives.

If you're seeing oil seep from the junction of the trans and the engine, 
or you look up at your starter motor and see it wet with oil, or you're 
experiencing clutch chatter, you might be a candidate for this 
procedure.  Of course, oil can also be coming from the engine oil seal, 
but the character of trans oil is very different from engine oil and you 
should be able to tell the difference.  If you separate the engine from 
the trans and determine the engine oil seal is OK, then its most likely 
the transmission main oil seal that's the culprit.  

I'd advise having an oil seal puller (that wicked-looking double-hooked 
tool) since the main shaft rubs right up against the seal, making it hard 
to get a hold of the seal any other way.  You can also use a large 
washer, slightly bigger in diameter than the seal itself and with a 
middle hole large enough to slip over the main shaft, to seat the new 
seal into place.

With the engine separated from the trans and the trans oil drained:

	Unclip the release (throwout) bearing from the release lever
        and swing the release lever up out of the way.

	Remove the 3 bolts that hold the release bearing guide sleeve
        and remove the sleeve.

	Remove the main shaft seal in the usual fashion, i.e., destroy
        it with the sharp point of the seal puller until it falls
        apart enough that you can finally pull it out.  Be careful
	not to scratch or gouge the seal recess; chip away at the seal
        carefully.

	Clean out the seal recess with a rag or some paper towels.

	Oil the nnew seal and push it into place with the washer.  I
        found I could do this without having to resort to using a
        piece of pipe big enough to slip over the main shaft.

	Replace the guide sleeve and release bearing.

	Fill the trans with oil.

When I asked the list about replacing this seal one respondent 
recommended removing the transmission bellhousing to accomplish the 
task.  While this would undoubtedly make the act of extracting the seal 
itself easier, I don't really see that it's necessary, and you always run 
the risk of damaging the gasket between the bellhousing and trans.

Another respondent said he replaces the seal every time the engine is 
out.  Its easy enough to replace the seal and I probably will follow this 
recommendation.
