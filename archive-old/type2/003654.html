After I posted the first message I went back out and tried it again. After
setting
the dwell (adjusting the gap, tightening the screw, then turning it over
again to see if it changed) I checked and I couldn't move the points by
pushing with a screw driver. Then I started the Bus and watched the dwell on
the meter. After a couple minutes I could watch the needle slowly move up
until it hit about 77 degrees then it quit. I popped the distributor cap
again and I still couldn't move anything. I don't know if it has anything to
do with it, but, when I tried to check the timing and it was bouncing all
over the place. Any Ideas?
