Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Rear Drum Removal!

Even easier way to remove the center nut is to take your bus down to the
local tire store where they do truck tires...have them put the 1&quot; impact
on it, and buzz it off...clean up the surfaces, and coat the threads
with a good anti-seize...put the nut back on, tight enough that you can
remove it at home (I do this by hand) and put another cotter pin back
in...pay the guy a few bucks, and go back there next time you need
tires...it builds good Karma with the locals...

Good luck...Den.
