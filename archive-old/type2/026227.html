It sounds like you have an early (62-3) Type 3 engine which would make it a
1500.  If you use it in the bus I would suggest changing it over to dual
carbs (64-6) or even dual port w/carbs(67).  I could supply you with engine
tin &amp; exhaust parts if you decide to go that route.  What you will need, in
any case, is a way to direct the cooling air into the fan housing at the
back of the engine (rear of the vehicle).  In a Type 3 there is a cavity in
the body coming from the vents and across the whole rear end of the car and
then a large rubber boot directing it into the fan.

&gt; 
&gt; Roy has gone and done it again. He rescued a 1976 westy from the 
&gt; Mountains of North Carolina today. The camper is almost all there. He 
&gt; even got the stove to work :) The bus came with a motor and as usual 
&gt; it was in the cargo bay instead of the engine room. Upon inspection 
&gt; the motor is a type III 1600 with a single carb with the funkiest oil 
&gt; bath air cleaner setup I have seen. The original plan was to part the 
&gt; bus out but there is now discussion of putting a new nose and rear 
&gt; corner on the beast and drive it as a beater for now.
&gt; 
&gt; An autopsy has yet to be performed on the motor bus assuming it runs 
&gt; has anyone ever put a type III in a late model bus? Performance wise 
&gt; it should hold its own against an upright but are there any other 
&gt; considerations regarding fabbing tin and a hanger bar?
