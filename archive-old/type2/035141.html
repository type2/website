Subject: Re: Cost of Owning a Bus

It's only money, the issue may be the time, well spent or otherwise, in the
owner maintenace chores.  There are differences between bay-window bus
drivetrain designs that are much bigger than the differences between any 1600
split window vs. baywindow, so the main conclusion you all can reach is that
the early bug motor drivetrain had 30 years of evolution to its benefit.

Somebody said, sure the type I motors are cheaper, &quot;because they are made in
mexico, but what will happen when that stops&quot;?

This is the point.  It never did stop, the type 4 motors were not acceptable
as the replacements in most markets.  The gvw manager who tried to do this to
the bug in 1970 got fired, somebody else please tell the story right, I don't
have all the details, but I hear he wanted to use the mid-engine 914 platform
to build a successor to the beetle as the basic vw sedan model and it was
such a mess they canned the whole administration, this was just after audi
started to screw up the old engineering designs already.  I'm thinking this
was not the 411 model, it was mid engine and a beetle-type low cost car.
Anybody ever see these designs?

&gt; Any 20-30 (or even 40-50) YO vehicle is not going to be as reliable as a
&gt; brend new one but I still see new cars broken down all the time on the
&gt; side of the xway so nothing is foolproof.
&gt; Look around at the cars on the road? How many are as old as your bus? It
&gt; says quite a bit about the design that we have these out there.
&gt; I like not being in the disposable car loop.
&gt; I love the feeling of busses and if I look at the cars on the road there
&gt; are few which I see myself driving happily down the road.
