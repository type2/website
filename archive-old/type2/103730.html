&gt; &gt; I am mainly a T1 engine guy but I have been working on
&gt; &gt; building one good late bay out of 2, and I have

&gt; &gt; pancake engine. So is it easier to remove the whole
&gt; &gt; engine and tranny as a unit?
&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion, yes.

this is a very religous issue with many differing opinions however most
agree that it is easier to remove the auto tranny engine without removing
the tranny,  couple reasons, the auto tranny is dang near as heavy as the
engine, and the engine does not have to come back as far to clear the
tranny as there is no long shaft sticking out

&gt; It is nearly impossible to do it alone, though. If you have a very good
&gt; lifting device, like one of those atv jacks, it can be done with one person.

I do it alone with one of those harbor freight $50 tranny jacks, although
I think I will pony up for a hyd one soon 

&gt; always the last 2 inches, this is not an issue if the engine and trans are
&gt; already together. The other advantage is that the entire engine, I mean
&gt; everything, stays with the engine for the install/pull taking the tin off

also with the auto tranny the linkage is different and can be screwed up
really easy with the tranny in, and it is very NLA (most pieces)

&gt; Or get a helper to hold the other end while you tighten or loosen.

vice grips work too, use carefully so as not to mess up the bolt heads
