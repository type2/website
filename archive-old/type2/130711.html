Subject: Re: [T2] Strange type1 case. 

Hello Guys  There is a vanagon that was brought over from Ireland  right hand 
drive that has this type of case,  It is a cross between a type 1 and type 3  
had the stangest looking intake and a single 34 carb in the middle. The tin 
work was also different  &gt; It was at Everybus this year  later and have fun
