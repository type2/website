Subject: Re: [T2] More looking at vans....


More on this van - one of my cousins saw it for me today as he lives in
the area. He thinks the ticking or clicking may be the drive axles, but
that they will go that way for a long time.

He thinks there is a vacuum
leak or bad cylinder head as there is a &quot;sh&quot; sound while it's starting up
- and that all the hoses should be replaced as well as the head.

He said if I'm really into the &quot;scene&quot; it would be a great van, otherwise
I might have it in to a mechanic once a month for repairs (which I doubt.)

He liked the body and anterior, new tires, etc.

Sounds like I should get a compression test? And take it to another
mechanic as I wouldn't want to get into a new head that early in the
game...

 Aside
from  that he thought I'd be better off buying a new Azuzu trooper.




&gt;
&gt; &gt; 1982
&gt; &gt; 50k overall miles
&gt;
&gt; Really??
&gt;
&gt; &gt; new heads by owner who has engine shop?
&gt;
&gt; On a 50k engine?  Seems odd.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Poptop might need pain or jelcoat as is stained?
&gt;
&gt; Sand it, patch it (Mar Glass) prime it (PPG DP 48 (white) with DP 401
&gt; catalyst) paint it VW Cloud White.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Has one mechanical problem - bushing at end of gear shift linkage might
&gt; need adjustment? Is he talking about the throw-out bearing?
&gt;
&gt; I think this means the plastic bushing at the very front.  If so, it is
&gt; easy.  The others are hard.  Ask him which.
&gt;
&gt; Has
&gt; &gt; intermittent clicking...
&gt;
&gt; As in 'tick tick tick.....'   Better find out before shelling out...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; $3000-$4000
&gt;
&gt; Rust is a major factor you haven't mentioned.  Look under the windshield and
&gt; other windows for bubbles, holes bondo or plain old rust.  Look under the
&gt; mats, look at the corners, look at the door bottoms, and look at the front
&gt; axle.  Bring a piece of cardboard and some latex gloves so you can do this
&gt; without getting too dirty.
&gt;
&gt; If you live in the Southwest, $3,000 is tops for a rust-free primo straight
&gt; bus with lots of bells and whistles.  Supply and demand, you know.  In other
&gt; parts of the land, where rust takes higher casualties, you might pay more
&gt; for a bus in said condition.  But remember, it's 20 years old, it's not
&gt; sexy, it's not fast, it's not an investment, it has an engine that requires
&gt; lots of owner involvement (not a bad thing, but uninteresting to lots of
&gt; folks) and if you walk, there's probably not a long line of other takers at
&gt; $3,000.
&gt;
&gt; Look for rust, and if none, and everything else is good, offer $2,200 and be
&gt; willing to give $2,500.  If you're not in a hurry, spend some time scanning
&gt; ebay and the classifieds just to get a feel for the market.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck,
&gt;
&gt; Grant
&gt;
