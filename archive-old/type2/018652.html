Every tire question ever asked has been answered EVERY MONTH would be
more like it. Obviously these are newbies and it's good that they are
aware how important the right tires are to their enjoyment of these
unique vehicles. What this tells me is that some enterprising vendor
should set himself up with a supply of these tires or means to drop ship
them and competely dominate the market of online type 2 tire customers.
For years I have dealt with one or two mail-order wholesalers and been
completely happy with their service. The  tires I have been most
recently happy with have been Avon Van rated 1850lbs._at_65psi. Recently my
supplier has been unable to get these. Too bad, they were the best I'd
tried so far. Many tires I've used have developed tread separations
after 20-30k miles.
