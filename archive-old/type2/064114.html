WARNING, Will Robinson, WARNING

These are NOT standard cap screws, they are HARDENED cap screws.
Unless you want to hear some incredibly strange noise emanating from 
you CV's get the right screws.  BTDT

You *might* be able to find the proper SIZE and LENGTH of screws, but 
the unthreaded shaft also MUST match, otherwise the shearing action
of torque will bust the screws.  The unthreaded area is where the forces 
should act, never on the thread section of these screws.

&gt; BTW socket head 8mm cap screws of the appropriate size should
&gt; be able to be found cheap, about $1 each or less to replace
&gt; messed up ones if needed.  Might find them at your local hardware store
&gt; may have to go to a better fastener store.
