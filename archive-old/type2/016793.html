Sounds a lot like the master cylinder is at fault.  The pump-up in 3-4
strokes is the main clue I'd base that on.  The difference between the
front and back should be because one part of the master cylinder is
worse than the other.  What were the symptoms that prompted you to do
the complete brake job in the first place?  Sounds like you've exhausted
the resources available-- thanks for doing the obvious stuff first!  I
had a similar problem with a Rabbit, and it took a new m/c to get it
back to working right.  And a custom mod on the one I bought because the
P.O. had changed out the vacuum booster, which had a longer pushrod on
it, not letting the m/c return fully.  Might want to check that, the
pushrod should not contact the M/c until you actually push the pedal
down.  If it rides on the m/c piston, it will cause problems not unlike
the ones you have, but will lock up the brakes if you aren't careful.

HTH.  :&lt;)

&gt; After trials and tribulations, studing the H-M-B threesome of manuals and
&gt; the Arch*ves, I can't seem to cure my spongy brake pedal.  Here is the
&gt; story.  Subject is the Turtle, 1970, stock drums all around.  I have
&gt; replaced all shoes, front and back, wheel cylinders, rubber hoses, and rear
&gt; drums.  All went well until it came to bleeding brake fluid.  I have gone
&gt; around the bus rear to front many times, used every method recommended in
&gt; the manuals, brought the 3/16 vinyl hose up and over the tire, and in the
&gt; process I have flushed thru 3, yes 3 Qts. of brake fluid.  I get no more air
&gt; in the hose, fluid runs clear.  I have adjusted all wheels to tight minus
&gt; 2-3 clicks on the adjusters.  But still, as in the beginning, the pedal goes
&gt; to the floor but pumps up to firm with 3-4 stabs of the brake pedal.  Sure
&gt; seems like air in the line, but where?  Don't know if it's a clue, but the
&gt; pedal bottoms out at the floorboard when a rear bleeder is open, but stops
&gt; hard about 2&quot; above the floor when a front bleeder is open.  I find no
&gt; evidence of a leak anywhere.  I am embarrassed by how long this brake job
&gt; has taken.  Help!
