hi all,

Just thought i'd weigh in here... No type of bus is more or less suitable
for driving than any other type I think.

I have probably 80k baywindow and 30k splitwindow miles under my belt, not
that many but I dont hesitate to take either vehicle anywhere. For some
reason now that I have my 61 it is my preferred road trip vehicle, but my
71 still dutifully ferries me back and forth to work in the winter months
and when my 61 is laid up for repairs. (if you havent driven a bus in the
snow, try it they are great!)

I perfer the 61 for road trips as it is better off-road and I like to get
WAY off the beaten path, its light weight, low gearing, and shorter
overhangs let me get to places i wouldnt dare try in my 71.

But, the 71 is a smoother highway cruiser, though the weight is a bit much
for the stock 1600. a 1700+ baywindow would be ideal for on road
trips.  Roomy and comfortable. Oncoming traffic doesnt give one quite the
heebie jeebies it can in a split what with the windshield being 5 inches
from your face it seems.

As for splittie owners only going to and from shows, sadly that is
becoming more and more true, but I am not one of those folks, 4-5000 miles
last year wandering in NM, in a few weeks we are heading out to key west
and back from MO doing some exploring in national forests along the way.

Its a vehicle, not a garage sculpture, drive it, whatever year it
is. Perfect paint means you aren't getting out enough ;)

take care,

Steve
