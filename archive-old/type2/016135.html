Well, as some of you know I am currently stationed with my family in 
Heidelberg Germany, I'm not in the Army my wife is,  and I had the chance to 
attend the Grand Nationals this past weekend which is a very large VW 
air-cooled and U.S car show.  The turn out was awesome.  We had over 25 split 
window buses, 10 Bay window and a couple of 80's model busses.  Don't forget 
the hebmuellers and split window bugs not to mention the off the wall 
vehicles in attendance.  But I must say the high light of the weekend, other 
than all us air cooled die hards together was when we got do run on the 
Hochenheim International Race Track.  There was a split racing a vette, a bay 
racing a stang and everything else in between.  AWESOME!!  But to all good 
things an end must come and thus it did with a wild show to remember.  And if 
your in the area, stop by I'll tell you more about it.
Peace Out
Rick Keesee
Heidelberg Germany......
P.S  the numbers over here are down so I'd suggest holding on to whatever you 
got at whatever the cost,,  AND STAY COOL...AIR-COOLed
