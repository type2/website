I'm guessing offhand that those are the resisters to keep a load for the
injectors.  As far as the voltage regulator, in the 76 model, it's on
the right side of the firwall (passenger side).

Have him check the voltage while running the engine.  I believe it
should run at about +14v to charge efficiently.

&gt; I have a friend with a 1980 Vanagon. He seems to be having charging
&gt; problems. He found a silver box on the firewall with 5 wires coming out of
&gt; individual ceramic tubes. He says it's the voltage regulator. It definitely
&gt; had problems. One of the wires was severed and 2 were frayed almost to the
&gt; point of breaking.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know much about these later beasts, but this thing sure doesn't
&gt; look like any voltage regulator I've ever seen. My 1971 bus has it sitting
&gt; right on the firewall where it belongs! This thing has a couple of part
&gt; numbers:
&gt; 
&gt; 022 906079
&gt; 0 280 159 001
&gt; 
&gt; So my questions are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. What is this thing?
&gt; 2. Would this thing cause the battery to not charge up?
&gt; 3. Where the heck is the voltage regulator?
