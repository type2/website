Got a f.i. bus, '78 2.0, all stock..here is the problem.  this is
intermittent.  I drive down the street no problem but when you go around a
corner( and this is only about 30% of the time) the car will die and won't
start, usually for about 20 to 30 minutes, then it starts right up.  my
first thought is that their is something in the tank that is getting suck to
the fuel outlet, then held by pressure from the line and after sitting and
the pressure releases, it floats away.  I don't know if this is the reason
but I can't think of anything else.  Any help would be most appreciated as
their is a safety issue going through intersections while turning and it is
a royal pain in my As* to be stuck there.  Help!
