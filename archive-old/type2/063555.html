Subject: winshield wiper fluid and JEOPARDY

Recently, someone said that they got around to adding the pressure to the
wiper fluid container, but when i did it, within ten seconds, wiper fluid was
all over my fuses and wires behind the steering column.  : (
so my queston(i seem to have many these days) is what do i need to replace,
all of the tubing, or do you think it was a connctor or something--i couldn't
see anything under there.

and oh yeah, everybody HAS TO WATCH JEOPARDY tonight at 7:30(on the east
coast anyway) because MY DAD IS ON IT!!!!!!!!!!
HIS NAME IS ROB VINCENT, AND HE'S TAKING ME TO HAWAII!!!!
bye, thanks for all of the help
