Subject: bye bye brakes

so this last monday i fired up the bus for the first time in about 2 weeks 
(id been driving one of the ghias instead), i was supposed to haul some 
furniture on tuesday, but wanted to check on the timing and gas it up before 
then...as im leaving the barracks parking lot, my brakes made it known to me 
that they are now out on strike...theres really nothing like that feeling 
when your foot sinks to the floor, and the brakes dont grab, there really 
isnt...sooo, now i can stop, after pumping the pedal several times (as of 
last wednesday, the condition may have worsened) i checked underneath, but 
couldnt find a sign of leaks anywhere. when i parked the bus, 2 weeks ago 
(well, i guess by now its closer to 3) the brakes worked fine, no sign of 
problems...now it feels like air in the system...any ideas where this came 
from?

mando friday content: anyone ever consider rigging a westy poptop as an 
airbrake? thats what i always think of when i put mine up.... :)


later!
