Subject: RE:Removable apron retro fit

Hi All,

Well a got a few replies like this so I'm replying to the list and answering
them all.  Basically the apron was cut out, a flat piece of steel was wleded
to eithier side of the engine bay where the arpon was mounted and this was
drilles and tapped with a thread, four on eithier side.  The apron was then
cut a little shorter and plates were welded to this and then drilled, my
apron does not sit flush with the body though, I had to move it outwards
about 2 inches to fit the engine.  From above it looks like this.

|&lt;-holes here           |&lt;- holes here
|-----------------------|
'-----------------------'

The four bolts hold it firmly in place and make it easy to remove, if you
want it too mount flush, which I suspect most will it'd be a little harde

Hope this helps a little anyway
Cheers
Steve

&gt;My 75 has a removable apron, non standard of course but a necessity with
the
&gt;V8 engine I run in it.

Hi Steve.  I figured just saw down both sides, bolt or weld a couple of
pieces of angle iron on either side with drilled holes, then run bolts
through the holes to remount the apron.  Anything special I need to know?

Or maybe weld the angle iron in place first so it's aligned right.  THEN
saw.
