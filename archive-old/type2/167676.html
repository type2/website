&gt; Odom was _at_ 38,827.4 yesterday with new oil, etc. Last night's test drive

check your timinng for the power issue

&gt; Cut the engine, sent honey to pick up lunch. I waited about 5 - 10 minutes,
&gt; then checked the oil. Engine was hot. Oil was _at_ minimum line (level parking
&gt; lot).

need to let engine sit a little longer for oil to fully drain down I
think

&gt; Willing to pay the $2,500 for a new one - where do I find it? Mid-America
&gt; has new ones on sale - but they're for the type 1's. Numbers/websites
&gt; please. Thanks guys.


Boston Bob
Boston Engine Exchange

Northwest Connecting Rod
no website is supposedly very good also

not sure about the others except that GEX is trash and I have a court
decision saying so
