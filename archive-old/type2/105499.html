Subject: RE: [T2] windshield seal

&gt; Also, does anyone know of a source for good quality seals that will 
&gt; accept the strip? Any special advice relating to installation of the 
&gt; seal with the chrome strip in it?


We stock genuine Volkswagen windshield seals for just $19.95 each, which
are superior to any repro seal.  Alas, they are only available without
provision for the chrome strip, as this is how the Bus was sold almost
everywhere but the U.S.  

I always recommend just doing away with the chrome moldings unless
you're absolutely in love with them, for a few reasons. First, you will
pay about 1/2 the price for every seal on your bus if you don't insist
on the version with a provision for the chrome strip - and will get
better quality, as genuine VW seals and top quality European repros are
available only sans strip.  Plus, you'll save the cost of buying the
strips (which tend to age badly anyway). Finally, most busses worldwide
did NOT have the chrome strips to begin with (it was largely a U.S.
option), so your bus would still be &quot;stock&quot; looking without it.
