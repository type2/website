Subject: fate of the '69 bus:for sale./ '67 to get new metal

Kelly Brown (aka the MetWiz) and local NEATO boss Neil Picket came by the
house to survey the wrecked '69 and look over the new '67. The good news is
that the rocker and other small repairs to the '67 are striaght forward and
can be done relatively quickly. The bad news is the '69 won't be the same
cakewalk :( repoirs to the wrecked rear end of the '69 bus are doable but
the labor costs involved look as though they may prohibitively exspensive
for me to handle.

I will proceed with repair work on the '67 becuase I can afford it and we
need a daily driver family bus. That leaves the fate of the '69 way up in
the air. I DONT feel good about parting this bus out and will resist doing
so. I wil however sell the bus for a very fair price without the engine(need
to keep it for a spare.) If you can weld and want a very nice and COMPLETE
1969 passenger bus with all the interior and exterioir (except for the
wrecked left rear corner and back end or you wanna spend the bucks to get
someone else to do it contact me and we will try to work out a fair deal. If
you want the bus for parts please DONT respond at this time. I would much
prefer to find a loving home for it.

Here is a short list of what needs replacing
rear bumper
engine valance
engine lid
hinge carrier
engine hanger
rear cargo door
left rear corner from the beltline down all the way starting at the rear
side seam.
and of course a motor

here is what is good
all glass
all seats (7pass walkthru)
all interior 
transmission
brakes
steering
all electrics
all other areas of body have shiny paint and no rust

Again this was an almost perfect bus that looked 5 years old and no 30 so if
you have MIG and weld this might be the project for you.

The bus is located in Greensboro, North Carolina
As of now there are no photos available on the net but that may change in a
week or so.
