Subject: re: Tire twist

Hey Terry...

Tire shredding has been around for MANY years...we used it in the 60s and 70s to
get our ice racing tires to &quot;bite&quot;....dirt trackers still do it today...truckers
do it too, but with larger grooves...they call it re-grooving...

Not an artform you'll likely see in a &quot;new&quot; tire store, but it sounds like you
may have lucked out...

Enjoy the ride...

Den.
