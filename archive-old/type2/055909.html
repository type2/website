Subject: Seats &amp;  Carpet for '68

Hello everyone,
I'm considering purchasing tweed bucket seats from Sewfine for my '68 
Campmobile.  Also looking at front door panels and enough of the tweed 
material to redo the rear facing seat and bed/back seat.  Does anyone 
have experience dealing with Sewfine (particularly with seats)? 
 Apparently they install without drilling.  Also, I want to add carpet 
to the bus and someone suggested the bus carpet kit from Rocky 
Mountain Motorworks.  Any thoughts?  I couldn't search the archive on 
this do to errors on the web server.  Any insight would be 
appreciated.  Thanks.
