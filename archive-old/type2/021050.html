Subject: front tin

Hello,
While I was checking the oil in my engine last night I noticed a gap 
between the front engine tin and the firewall...  Upon closer inspection 
I realized it was beetle tin instead of the correct bus tin (71 bus - SP 
engine)
What I'm wanting to know is, does the gap there matter?  I realize it 
would help keep the engine compartment a bit cleaner, but will it affect 
cooling at all?  I guess while I was in a hurry to get this engine in, I 
overlooked this.  Everything else checks out A-ok though.

Isaiah
