Subject: Re: [T2] Eberspacher model BN

Hi Charles,

The BN-4 was fitted in buses up to 1974. It fits fine with dual  
carbs, unless the left side of the engine bay is already being used  
for an auxiliary battery as was done with some westies.  The ducting  
enters the passenger compartment just inboard of the left rear wheel.


Happy trails,

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know if the Eberspacher model BN4 heater fits into a
&gt; standard dual carb 74 engine in a 77 body? I am looking at getting one
&gt; but the seller has expressed concerns that the carbs may prevent
&gt; correct fitting?
