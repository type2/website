Hey Ken....

I've got two vacuum lines coming from my dizzy, one from the back that
runs to the aluminum exhaust manifold and the one on the bottom that runs
to the left side vacuum port on the carb, right next to the idle speed
adjustment screw.  

First, which hose (or both) should be plugged?  

Secondly, are my vacuum hoses running to the right places on the carb from
the dizzy? There is another vacuum port on the rear (rir) of the carb to
the right of the accelerator spring and armature, but that has a cap on
it.  

Thanks for the help, I'm finally getting suggestions that I haven't
explored yet..:)

Oh, third question...  When I set the timing statically at 5 deg. ATDC,
the engine runs very roughly, barely idling....

When I hook up the strobe, the degree wheel reads 30 deg. ATDC, upon which
I readjust the timing to 5 deg according to the reading on the
strobe...And the engine runs much better, and I leave it there. Why is
this reading different?  Is it not possible to set the timing accurately
with a static light for the stock dizzy on my 71?

Cheers,

Tom
