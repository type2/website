Do all the hoses at once. There is brake line wrench but a flared or
non-flared 11mm will do.

&gt; Any parts I should make sure not to forget?

&quot;Service&quot; the adjusting stars with anti-seize while you are in there.
Missing any rubber plugs from the backing plates?

&gt; Is it impossible to do the rears without the hubs off

I'm not sure what you mean. The rear wheel cylinder can come off after you
remove the drum.

While you are there, try to move the hub to gauge how much play there is on
the rear wheel bearings.
