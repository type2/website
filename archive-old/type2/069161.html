Subject: Looking for parts, '71 Westy and tent

I'm calling on fellow early model breadloaf fans to see if you have any of
the following in your grab bag of goodies from the junkyard, swap meet, etc.
for sale.  Please e-mail me if you have any or know a good source. 

- - '71 Type 2 Owners Manual in good condition (fits in the glove compartment)
- - Rubber stops for gas tank door
- - Rubber seal for antenna (drivers side, teardrop shaped)
- - Original or reproduced copy of Westy tent instructions
- - Plastic tips for Westy tent corner poles
- - Fabric that is same as or very near original Westy curtain material in
texture and pattern design.

I'll probably find these on my own eventually.   But hey, if you've got a
spare few of these lying around just collecting dust, please e-mail me and
let's make a deal.  Maybe I've got something you've been looking for in my
bag of goodies.

Thanks,

Budd Willis in Riverside, CA (Ho-hum, it was 75 degrees and sunny on Sat and
Sun)
'71 Westy
