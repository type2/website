Subject: Backup lights

So,
I have tail lights and turn signals, but no backup lights. The fuses are all 
good and the bulbs are not burnt out, so where do I go now? Is there a 
switch, that gets engaged when I move the shifter into reverse, that may be 
haywire? If so, where is it located and how do I access it? I looked in the 
Bentley and Muir books, but found no information on what to do.

This vehicle is a '75 bus  with an Automatic trans.

               Pete

I have the same exact deal with my '71 T-2.. Any help IS appreciated.
