&gt; For those neophytes out there, you should know that welding on a used
&gt; gas tank that hasn't been properly cleaned in preparation for welding
&gt; is extremely dangerous and can result in severe injury and death.

OK,

I drained what little was in the tank and
I FILLED the tank with WATER (water was pouring out of all the vents,
etc.) and shook, drained some shook some more, drained some shook some
more.  (Real fun trying to move a 15 gallon tank full of water)

repeated entire process three times.
Did a sniff test, no fumes.
Did my welding
rinsed the tank with paint thinner followed by lacquer thinner followed by
gas

Andrew's point is well taken, but on a side note, maybe anyone who doesn't
realize the danger in this undertaking would be candidates for next years
Darwin Awards. ;-)
