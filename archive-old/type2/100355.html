Subject: Gex Heads

I know everyone always bashes Gex, but has anyone had any experience with 
there stock heads, if so how have they performed and have there been any 
problems. I have spoken with them and they say they do reinforce the seats 
to prevent the dropped seat problem. Any insight would be great. I know 
someone that has a new unused set. They are remanufactured of course.
