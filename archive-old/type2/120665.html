Subject: Re: type2 Digest 21 Mar 2004 02:00:00 -0000 Issue 3560

I will weigh in on the tire thread. I just bought a set of Michelin Agilia Tires C rated tires from my local dealer here in Toronto.

I had spoken with a few specialty stores when I told them what I wanted swore up and down that these tires were discontinued and tried to talk me into Michelin Pilots. Well after some legwork on my behalf I found out that they are still very much available and promptly ordered myself a set.

Received them last week and mounted successfully. Of course same issue with the wide 5 and no balacing options but may look into greg potts suggestion.
