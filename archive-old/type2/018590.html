Message-ID: &lt;376C62B3.BAD807FD_at_west_dot_net&gt;

My california bus has non-CA carbs. Can anyone tell me what parts I may
be missing? (021 129 031&amp;2 N--s/b Q)

Also, dear Mr. PO removed the electro idling cutoff valves on right and
left. Evidently he was determined, because he rewired to eliminate the
connections. What havoc is this causing (if any?)
