Subject: 1971 Westy FS

1971 Westy Hardtop, 177,000 miles, 1600dp rebuilt 12,000 mile ago, New 
carburetor, New alternator conversion, New shocks all the way around, 4 tip 
GT muffler, New heat exchangers, and valve covers. The interior is in fair 
shape the front seats are in good shape and the rear seat/bed is in okay 
shape but it has a couple small cracks. It has all of the closets and storage 
spaces and the mosquito screen and child's cot. The only thing missing is the 
sink/ice box unit. The body is okay there are some small dents and small 
areas of rust in the lower rocker panel area in front of the rear wheels it 
probably could use a paint job it's red with a white top.
This Bus is mechanically sound it runs and drives great I drive it everyday 
without any problems I have driven it all over Oregon and Washington without 
any problems. The only thing it needs is someone with more time than I have 
right now to give it the TLC that it deserves. It is located in Portland 
Oregon. Asking $1,300.00 so if anybody is interested you can e-mail me at 
Jskier24_at_aol_dot_com
Thanks
Jason
