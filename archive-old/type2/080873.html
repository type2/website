Subject: Re: [T2] Buggy World Vs. Save a Bug

Hi Sherri
I've used Save a Bug for parts-they normally have everything I need. Never
used either for service, you might try Car Craft in Riverside for service,
they diagnosed my girlfriends Type 3 FI problem and did it cheap and quick
and it also worked after she got it back. I've also had them rebuild heads
for me.

Subject: [T2] Buggy World Vs. Save a Bug


&gt; Hi gang,
&gt;
&gt; I need to take Buster in this weekend to finally get him fixed and I was
&gt; wondering if any list members have used either Save-A-Bug in Riverside
&gt; or Buggy World in Norco? Any recommendations for the Inland Empire, Ca
area?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks Bunches!
&gt;
