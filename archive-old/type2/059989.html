I intend to put Dual Kadrons on my new 1600cc Mexican engine....

Gene Berg Ent. sells the Kadrons with a sheet explaining jetting and
installation.  It is very clear that &quot;out of the box&quot; they are jetted for
1600DP engines.... you must re-jet them if you want to go larger.

I can't think of a more respected resource when it comes to a technical
claim like this...

Howdy pholks....  TommyBoy here with a question on lungs.  I'm considering
going w/ duallies to get some more low end power to conquer those hardcore
Colorado mountains this winter.  Has anyone ever run the dual Kaddies on a
stock motor?  
I've heard mixed opinions...
- They are way to big
- They are spec'd on all Mexican beetles, stock by VW
- They are great if you down jet them

So, I'm flamboozled, any advice?
  Thanks Krew...
