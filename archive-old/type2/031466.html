&gt; &gt; My 1600 has developed a strange problem; when the motor has been driving fro

ages ago I had a 1300 that did the same thing, took me months to find the
problem, the fuel line on the vacuum side had a small hole, when cold it
was fine, but as the engine bay got warm the fuel line softened up a bit
and it started sucking air..  check and change all fuel lines
