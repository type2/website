Subject: Colorado Springs listees

Hi;
   Nikki Elko and Rick Taylor just arrived in Colorado Springs in
preparation for the RMMW show this week. Trying to track down Mike
Gensler's phone number. Anybody help? Nikki has one of those e-mail
phone gadgets so reply to her addy, cc'd above. Or send it to me and
I'll pass it on.

Thanks;
Art Lynch
