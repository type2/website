Have your replaced the hold down straps (all 3) on the inside?  New parts
make you wonder why you put up with that old stretched out rubber for so
long.  Also, make sure that the hinging mechanism at the front isn't tweaked
letting air in through the front of the seal.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; My '69 Westi still has the original smooth top, no ribs or bumps near the
&gt; pivot bolts.  I am NOT a fan of this top.  It has numerous stress cracks
&gt; near the bolts as well as along the vertical portions, and will NOT stay
&gt; down in the wind.  I have resorted to tying it down with a cargo strap
&gt; running gutter to gutter.
