&gt; Plugs are worn when the electrodes have lost metal and no longer appear
&gt; square when you view them cross section. The main symptom for worn plugs is
&gt; poor cold starting.
On my 71, I typically filed my fixed electrode flat and the side one
back to square; an old trick I heard was to file it so its edge bisects
the lower diameter; presumably gave better spark?  Never seemed to
hurt.
