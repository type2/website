Subject: Final question: align bore?

I've weighed all the advice and comments about whether or not to 
rebuild myself. In the meantime, I went out and inventoried all the 
parts that I've been squirreling away for two years and discovered that 
also have the complete gasket and seal kit, an end seal, the crappy 
little rubber elbow for the dipstick tube, and a complete clutch kit. 
So my choice is looking more and more obvious.

Anyway, I got a split decision on the align bore, AKA line bore. Some 
responses said I should do it, some said not to (given the assumptions 
under which I'm building), and one said don't do it because I may not 
be able to find bearings.

As for the oversized bearings, Boston Bob has assured me that whatever 
I need, he has; all I have to do is specify the grind of my crank.

So I'm down to I'd better do it, and it's okay if I don't do it.

Once more, the question is whether to have the aluminum case from a 
2.0L align bored. I would like to get maybe 30,000-50,000 miles out of 
this engine. After that, I am going to pull out all the stops and have 
B. Bob build me an engine.

If I could drive the case across town, I'd just do it. But I have to 
ship it across the country and then have it shipped back.

So what's the consensus? Bore, or no bore?

It would help if you could post to the list (although I'll accept 
p-mails gratefully) so that there's a little bit of debate -- and so 
that the thread ends up in the archives.
