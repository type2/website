Subject: Re: [T2] BIG news - NEW Front Axle Beams!!!


&gt; same as sold for $1500 by VW in the U.S. when they last had them. (Sorry,
&gt; they fit only '72-up. To fit one to a '68-71 you'd have to do a lot of
&gt; part-swapping with a post-71 donor bus.)

Actually, from what has been said lately, there is simply no way in hell
you'll fit it on a 68/69/maybe 70 bus.  Sometime in either late 69 or 70
the bolt spacing where the beam bolts to the frame changed.  You would
have to actually change the entire front section of frame.

just to note.
