Greetings,

I really do try not to be negative - especially in a public forum but I
think this needs to be said about Ron and Old volks home.

Perhaps things have changed since this happened to us over a year or so
ago but just  be forewarned.

I ordered a sway bar for the front of my 73 westy in Fall 98 from Ron and
never got it.  He had submitted the credit card bill and we paid it
becasue he assured us it was on its way.  A few months after ordering it
and not seeing it materialize, I called and he said  he had sent it and
it must have been lost.  He said he would send  another one.  It never
showed.  Then he droped out of sight.  No response to repeated e-mails or
phone calls for another 6 months.  He may be on a sabbatical but that is
no excuse for such poor business practices.  So we have been out our $100
or so.

Sorry for the negativity on this really positive and helpful list but I
though Nikki and others considering doing business with Ron should know
this.  I had done business prior to this incident with him without any
problems.   Ut now, I would think twice before working with him again.
