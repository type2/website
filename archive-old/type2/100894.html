I've been running synthetic in all my vehicles since 1976 or so (71 bus
bought new)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow, I just switched from 20W50 kendall dino oil to Mobil ! 15W50 full


I'm also using Mobil 15W50  (recently switched from now discontinued
Pennzoil 5W-50)

&gt; synthetic. I seem to be reading slightly lower oil pressure, both at idle

hmmmm, I used dino oil in my rebuilt engine break in and did a test day
before/day after switching from dino back to synthetic  and I got almost
no change in readings of presure and temp.  maybe ever so sligtly lower
temps

&gt; and when cruising at 55-60. The weather has begun to get milder finally;
&gt; today's high was around 85 with high humidity. At 200F oil temps running at

I would chalk it up more to the weather change

&gt; 55 I get a pressure reading of 30 - 35 psi. [This is on an 1800 with Weber
&gt; carb at 21K miles.] With the Kandall I was seeing pressures 5 - 10 psi
&gt; higher. Cold start pressuers are similarly lower. No changes made at all
&gt; except the oil.  Has anyone else experienced this sort of reading when
&gt; switching to synthetic oil?

remember the synthetic is less thick and flows easier than dino oil,
consider the fact that it &quot;always flows&quot; at a 15W rating.  but lubes at a
50 or so sayeth Mobil.

&gt; Just when I thought I had this oil stuff figured out!

keep an eye on it, my presure stays high even when hot too so that also
helps
