SNIP  . . . .

&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; As far as I know all you have to do is replace the condencer. It should
&gt; come with new wire attached to it. The dissy has no wires in it. The
&gt; wires are part of the condencer and are replaced with it. If I am wrong
&gt; please correct me, But I have never seen one that was any other way.
&gt; 
I think there is a bare copper strap, about two inches long, that should
connect the advance plate to the dizzy body.  Without this, it might
work, but the bearing will take the current and wipe out early.  I've
seen mighty machines that were sent to an early repair (600 hp electric
motor) because of stray currents through the bearings.
