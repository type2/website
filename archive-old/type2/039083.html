Subject: Re: Engine Warmup

If I'm not mistaken, a car will warm up faster and with less wear and tear
to the engine if you drive it rather than let it idle in the driveway. I
can't remember exactly why but I think it has something to do with the raw
fuel washin away the oil from the cylinders when the engine is cold. Lack of
lubrication is bad. Keep in mind that Muir is great for step by stepping
through some things but just flat out wrong on others (read automatic
choke). If you don't already have a Bentley manual, go get one. Use it to
cross reference with Muir and IMHO always go with Bentley's recommendations
if there is a conflict between the two.
Have fun,

&gt; I hope you folks aren't getting tired of my &quot;newbie simple questions&quot;, but
I
&gt; have another one. I thought I remembered reading in Muir's book about
&gt; allowing the time during warmup for it to get sufficiently warm before
&gt; putting it in gear, and I looked around and there it was on page 36. Last
&gt; night I'm reading the original owner's manual for my &quot;new to me&quot; 70'
&gt; Dormobile, and it says&quot;Do not try to warm the engine up by letting it idle
&gt; with the vehicle stationary- drive off straight away&quot;. What gives? I will
&gt; pick up the bus on Friday with a new 1600 cc engine, and I want to learn
it
&gt; and baby it, but this is confusing. It ought to be a simple thing it
seems,
&gt; but what should I do?
