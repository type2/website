Subject: Re: [T2] Finding a VDO dipstick sensor (was Overheating/Pulley)

Can't you get it above the upper engine access hatch to hear the alarm
while driving?  Ideally, get a mini-mini plug (maler and female), some
wiring (phone wireing is OK) and make an extension wire- I actually
soldered mine, ran it through the spare tire well in the closet, behind
the Westy cabinet, through the wall behind the driver seat, run it under
the rubber carpet of the seat-well, and then under the front mat to your
dash.  The other 2 phone wires I used for the electric vdo oil pressure
gauge.

&gt; I purchased an electronic cooking thermometer from Target for $15.  It has a
&gt; stainless steel probe and braided wire.  I had to bend it straight to get it
&gt; to slide all the way in.  It has an alarm that I have set to 225F.  Seems
&gt; pretty accurate and the price cannot be beat.  Right now I just have it
&gt; sitting in the cargo
