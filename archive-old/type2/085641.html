If it is a FI bus, one of the wires will be to activate the solenoid and
the other for the Fuel injection system, if they are reversed nothing
will happen.

Troy,
	If I recall, your solenoid has two spade connections. One on the
top &amp; one on the bottom the larger of the two wires went to the top one
&amp; the smaller went to the bottom. Did you ever pick up a VOM? This would
be handy to check if there is any juice going to these connections.
Since you have moved these wires some now, &amp; even that seems to effect
when your bus starts, there could be a short in any of the wires that we
worked on. this could cause this problem. This is one area you really
need a VOM.

&gt; Ok, so the connections on the starter were pretty rusted up and while 
&gt; at EB, the bus would not start because of this.  Jason Laster took a 
&gt; look for me and after a few scraps with a wire brush, the baby turned 
&gt; over
&gt; :-)  Well, I put the bus on the ramps and proceded to give the stubs
on
&gt; the starter a nice good cleaning.  Well, now that I cleaned all the
&gt; points, it wont turn over.  Not even a click.  Now, I am not sure if
it
&gt; matters what wires get put on first or last as far as the group going
on
&gt; the celenoid stud, but I don't think I put them back on in the same
&gt; order.  Would this matter?  Also, the large cable going from the
starter
&gt; to the celenoid is pretty green.  I detached it from the celenoid and
&gt; cleaned that stub and the connector on it and put it back on.  Also,
&gt; there is a black piece of plastic that covers the forward portion of
the
&gt; celenoid, in which the stubs come out of it.  I did break  a small
piece
&gt; of it off  (About 1 inch).  Not sure if this matters but wanted to
&gt; include everything.  Thanks
