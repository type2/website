Subject: RE:  flat spot just off idle w/ new 40mm Webers
Date: Thu, 3 Dec 1998 10:45:41 -0600 

&gt;All:  Just installed dual 40mm Webers on my '72.  Rus very well, with 
&gt;the exception of the flat spot just off ide.  After adjusting the
vehicle 
&gt;so that it would pass emissions by leaning out the idle air needle
jets, 
&gt;the bus demonstrates a lag just off idle.  Any ideas how to correct
this?

You'll never be able to get great performance and driveability and still
pass emissions with the dual webers.  If you passed emissions, make
notes on EXACTLY how your carbs, timing and points are set so you can
repeat it in the future.  Then set up the carbs to run good for you.

The simplest fix for the stumbling problem is to replace the F11
emulsion tubes with F7's.  But I gotta warn you, your already poor gas
mileage (around 19 mpg, right?) will drop to about 17.5 mpg.  Your
performance will be better, your head temps should be lower, and your
acceleration should be better because the F7's provide a richer
transition.

BTW, I'd like to know what size engine you're running along with your
carb's idle, main and air jets, and venturi size.

&gt;Also, have set 009 to 14 degrees advance at idle, and about 38 degrees 
&gt;total advance.  This on the advice of a local fellow who builds Pikes 
&gt;Peak hillclimb racers here in Colorado Springs.  No pinking or anything

Yikes!  That's WAY high!!  The local Porsche guru (he's an a-hole, but I
trust his advice) said never ever ever set them for more than 35, but he
prefers 28-32 depending on the application.  I time the 009's on my 73
Westy with 1.7 engine to 28 degrees and when I was running an 009 on my
914 2.0 I set it to 30 max advance.
