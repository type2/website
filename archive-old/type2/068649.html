I was so impressed with the Berg shifter I put on my bug, I got one for
&quot;The Carcass.&quot;  After using one of these, you WON'T want to go back
to stock!  I especially like the push-button reverse lock out--no more of
that &quot;shove it down, and poke around&quot; routine.

The bus shifter's handle is four inches higher, and four inches closer to
the driver--much handier.  It has about 35% less travel than stock,
making it more difficult to SEE what gear I'm in like I used to. (ie: if the
handle is over on the passenger side and touching the dash, then I'm in
third gear.) 8)  Now I have to remember. 

The quality of materials and workmanship is phenominal--I think it's the finest
made thing on the bus--probably why it costs $121.70...Whoa!...yep...but if
you can get the &quot;bread ahead,&quot; you won't ever regret it!

 Rick (Fabulous)        And the politicians are throwing stones
 '70 Westy                      So the kids they dance they shake their bones
 &quot;The Carcass&quot;           Cause its all too clear we're on our own
