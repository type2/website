&gt; We use Wool (from sheep) insulation, same configuration as fibreglass but

&gt; soggy when wet, never tried that though !

I have a suspicion that wool insulation is a bit more expensive in the
non-New-Zealand parts of the world!  Moths can be a problem too, and moth
balls (Paradichlorobenzine) are a greater health hazard than fiberglass.

OTOH, the best wedding gift we received was a Hudson's Bay Company wool
blanket.  11 years old, used almost daily, looks like new, and very warm!
