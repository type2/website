Subject: RE: [T2] Bay seats

For those wanting seats from a late bay, I have a set available.  They
lack the headrests, and need reupholstering.  But, you would have the
seat frame with the tracks etc to work with already.  I am sure
headrests could be found between junk yards or maybe from Bus Depot or
the others online.  First one to pay shipping can have them.

I have a 70 poptop westy that had terrible seats when I got it. I bought
a 
pair of later (I think 77 seats) They have headrests, that get in the
way of 
the kiddie cot. But lo and behold the headrests come out and when we go 
camping the kiddie cot is there.
I use it as a great place to put stuff when camping.
