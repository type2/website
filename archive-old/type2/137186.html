Subject: Oil light intermittantly on

OK, after 14 hr trip I changed the oil and filter in daughter's 75 bus
and now it intermittantly has the oil light come on and stays on (and
goes off again)- oil is present, no change in sound of engine, and I
assume it's the sender sticking- can anyone come up with any other
reason it might do this? (immaterial if warmed up or not).  Oil temp
gauge shows no increase in temp.
