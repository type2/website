&gt; There is enough fuel pressure under normal conditions to cause the excess to

Fyi, the engine will idle indefinitely with zero fuel pressure. Sounds
unbelievable, but it is true. There is enough pressure drop in the intake
ports to &quot;pull&quot; the fuel through the injectors. I tested this a few weeks
ago when I was trying to help a customer with is bus: turns out his pump was
running constantly because someone had bent the wire on the AFM that
actuates the micro switch for the pump. This was clearly done deliberately
by a misguided person. Perhaps this is what is happening to Tim's.
