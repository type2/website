I'd make the trip to the salt flats to see a 300mph bus!
Of course, you wouldn't be able to hold any passengers as you'd need the space
for your b_at_lls. ;-D

Happy father's day guys!

Don't laugh...I have  a complete T-58-10 Turboshaft that I bought surplus.
All it needs is a fuel control overhaul and some stator vane actuators, then
it will be ready for mounting in a bus....It is only 1,500 SHP..The hard
part is getting some gearing for it, as the engine needs to sustain RPM....I
will do it one day, maybe in a couple of years.

&gt; Think KEP can cut me an adapter plate to mate that up to a VW transaxle?
&gt;
&gt; Might wanna weld up 4th gear to handle the added tourque, eh?

&gt; ...the most recent engines I worked on put out 16,000hp, but they wouldn't
fit
&gt; into my type 2 , but they will get you from DC to NYC in 2.5 hours
