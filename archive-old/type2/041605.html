&gt; In fact, no electrons are lost due to resistance in a wire, nor are they

Well, if you really want to split atoms, the electrons don't really flow
through the wire as fast as we think.

Charge is indeed passed through wire by the movements of charged particles
called electrons.  Each electron has a miniscule charge (1.6x10^-19
Coulombs) but, to use a scientific term, there is a whole s***load of
electrons in a piece of wire.  Therefore, the average drift speed of
electrons in a current-carrying conductor is measured in millimeters per
hour.

Regardless of the actual speed of the electrons, one is always better off
to use the correct wire.  10 or 12 gauge is what is needed in this
application.
