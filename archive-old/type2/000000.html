Subject: need a helping hand in des moines IA...area.!!! please.

As it says above...I bought a 60 single cab and need someone to go look at it 
and inspect it and nit-pick it apart, then make me a list of what it will 
take to get it running to drive it home.  I only live about 2 1/2 hr. away in 
Omaha, NE.  I want to be prepared with the appropriate tools and parts when I 
get there to pick it up.  

If anyone has the time or initiative to help let me know and I will give you 
the address of where its at, and the owners # so you can call and setup a 
meeting time.  I will reimburse however you see fit.


To leave the list, send an UNSUBSCRIBE message to TYPE2-REQUEST_at_TYPE2.COM
