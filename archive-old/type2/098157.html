You have a slightly large hole, but if it is firmly in place it shouldn't
be a problem.

The larger the bearing, the greater will be the diameter gain when you
heat the hub.  You got lucky that the bearing didn't get hung up where it
would heat rapidly and expand.

I've never tried heating the hub to install bearings.  I'll have to give
it a try next time.
