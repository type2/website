Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Drain Plug hmmmm

Wayne,
	My '78 bus (which also had the original engine) had the same type of 
plug. Boy was it ever a bear. It too stripped out. I ended up taking an 
American 1/4 allen, filing it down a wee bit and hammering it into the 
hole until it was a very tight fit. I then stuck a cheater on it, and 
when it seemed all was hopeless, the sucker finally broke free.
	Boy was it ever a relief to get a hex head drain bolt on there.

-John Tracy

'70 Bus (recuperating from fire)

I found that the plug that had a hex hole -
&gt; i.e. it required an allen wrench to remove it.  Well, my allen wrench bent
&gt; before I could loosen the plug - I ended draining the oil through the
&gt; strainer whole.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone seen an oil drain plug that had an allen wrench hole in it?
