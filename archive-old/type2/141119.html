Subject: Re: [T2] Cam question(Hyd/solid)

Hi Phil,

    They will interchange but there are problems. Each cam has lobe entrance
ramps that are different. In other words the profile of the lobe circle on
each cam is more or less gently sloped where the lifter slides up the lobe
to full lift on the different cams.
    The hydraulic lobe's have a &quot;more gentle&quot; entrance ramp then the solid.
Using a solid lifter on a hydraulic cam, will in time wear out the
cam/lifters, and do general valve train ware/damage. Also they will be
noisy.
    You could call a cam grinder's tech line and ask. I would call Crane or
one of the other big name grinders. They all have &quot;800&quot; numbers, and most
are on line.
    Anyway I hope this helps.

Howard
