TRANSVAIR CONVERSION.

You need one... &lt;grin!&gt;


&gt;Driving to work this morning, I pulled out of the slow lane (right lane =&gt; 
&gt;USA) to pass some normal (60 mph) moving traffic.
&gt;
&gt;OK, I got a grip on myself, remembered I was driving a '78 Westy loaded to 
&gt;the gills with things I just have to have with me at all times, and pulled 
&gt;(snuck) back into the right (right, as in right/left, not right, as in 
&gt;right/wrong)lane.
&gt;
&gt;Question:  does the term 'accelerate' have any reason to be part of my 
&gt;vocabulary ??
