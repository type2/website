I wouldn't have thought of that.  I'd have called a cab :|

&gt; (Little Miss Sunshine, you got it wrong-the mechanic in the movie 
&gt; implies it's the cable with &quot;Your clutch is gone&quot; (or possibly
&gt; throwout arm- but you only have to push it if starter is kaput or
&gt; you have no battery power- 

Yeah... that's right.  Many years ago I drove from Phoenix to Las Vegas
that way, and we had to do the push-start thing because the starter was
shot.  I'll have to watch that garage scene again.  Funny stuff.  You
know, in 24 hours I had all 3 of my cars go from working to broken.  I
must have the King Midas touch today.  Waiting for my PC to crash :)
