Subject: [T2] Trip report - terminal velocity?

Roconante ('72 Westy) and I just completed trip #23 from East Texas to
Mexico City and back.

Every time we travel the toll road through the mountains south of Sautillo,
I have wondered what a Volkswagen van's terminal velocity would be on the
downhill straight-away.  The divided highway has a 12-mile section of
continuous grade which sure does appear to be a 12-15% grade.  In any case
it is the steepest road grade I have ever seen on a major highway and is
certainly not to USA grade standards.  The uphill run is usually a trip
taken in 2nd gear; downhill is 4th gear while braking to keep the engine
from over-reving.

This trip I finally had the correct combination of dry weather, daylight,
no wind, and no traffic so I could simply hold down the clutch to see how
fast a '72 West can roll downhill.  I had thought the van would reach a
downhill velocity at which it could not push through the air any faster.
The van rolled faster and faster with no sign of instability.  I got on the
brakes and eased the speed down when the speedometer reach 90MPH and was
still climbing.
