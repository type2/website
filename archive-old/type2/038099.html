Quoting Allyn de Vars &lt;aircoold_at_together_dot_net&gt;:

&gt; My first suggestion would be getting a Bentley Manual for the Westy.  The 
&gt; Bentley manuals have really great color wiring diagrams which make a
&gt; Haynes manual look like child's play.  

The Bentley is great. However the color wiring diagrams are only first editions. 
 Reprints do not have these.
