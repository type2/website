Subject: more electricals...

thanks for all the responses i got on my radio-hookup related 
electrical problems. everything works and i have highbeams now, too. 
the solution was to eliminate the loop through the old CB hookup and 
plug it right into the fuse box.

onto the next issue - my brake lights don't work. rear turn signals 
and rear parking lights are all fine. so are my reverse lights. but 
my brake lights are totally dead.

As far as i can tell it's not a grounding issue [i fiddled with the 
ground wires, and there was no difference]. So, before i go messing 
with the switches on the master cylinder i have a simple, but dumb 
question: is it possible for the bulb to work for turn and parking 
lights, but not brakes? that is, could this just be a matter of two 
blown bulbs, or is that unlikely?

-perry
