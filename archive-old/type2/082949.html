Subject: Re: [T2] Broken lock...

Replace the lock cylinder with a used one.  Switch your wafers to
the new cylinder and you'll keep the same keying.

Fix the latch mechinism (probably a little missing spring) to prevent
overstressing the cylinder.

&gt; So today I went out to open the dirvers side door on my bus. The lock has
&gt; been sticking for some time, but I have not had time to do anything about
&gt; it. Anyway, I turned the key and the lock opened, and then removed my key,
&gt; and about 3/4 of the lock came with my key. Is there anything to do about
&gt; this besides replace the handle?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
