Subject: Re: [T2] Door Weather Stripping????

Actually, I usually leave ALL the windows open. Both front door windows,
and the sliding windows on the side. 

It's just because the weather seals are soo.. well, thick really.. that
it's impossible to close the door.

&gt;  please tell me how I can get my door
&gt; &gt; seals to finally soften up enough.. or crush enough so that I can

&gt; Crack the window then close the door.
&gt; 
&gt; That simple.  Your bus is a vacuum.
