This is starting to smell like a FART, but:

Roll the jack over a piece of cardboard for the drop. Once balanced on the
jack, hoist up the left or right half of the engine high enough so the
opposite heater box touches the ground. Then, grunt n' heave until the
engine's off the jack entirely, slide out the jack, and lower the engine on
the cardboard. Now you can slide out the whole thing with the bus's wheels
barely off the ground. Easy! Not for those prone to hernias.

Cheers,
Ian

I have an early bay so I might be blowing smoke, but is it possible to
use a hoist from above through the hatch to lower the engine onto a sheet
of plywood or cardboard?  It seems as if this would eliminate the need to
lift the bus high enough to clear both jack and engine.
