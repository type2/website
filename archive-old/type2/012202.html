Subject: [T2] water pouring in, windshield area rust holes, 
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

For &quot;A bunch of little holes&quot; I would get some rust kill
that &quot;bonds with the rust and magically turns it into a
black, hard, paintable material&quot; This attribute is listed
on the container. Then get some JB weld, mix it up and then
fill in the holes (small right?. After it is set up you can
sand and paint it so it doesnt stick out as much. This isnt
the right way or the wrong way... just what I would do for
a quick fix.
