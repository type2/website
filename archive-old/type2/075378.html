Subject: Re:  FRAM Oil Filters

&gt;They must mistakenly think that none of the vw vans
&gt;need an antidrain back valve.  

Don't get me wrong; I'm not advocating Fram.  I took a Fram off of my 73 a few 
years back and the whole insides of the filter where LOOSE and rattling 
around!  But I don't see why having an antidrain back valve is necessary in a 
type IV motor.  The filter mounts open-end up so the filter won't empty when 
the motor isn't running.  In some cars the filter mounts the other way.  Those 
cars need the anitdrain back valve (and the manufacturers ought to be shot for 
making for such a messy oil change).  Am I missing something?
