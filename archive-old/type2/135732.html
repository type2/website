Subject: Re: [T2] Re: CHT sensor location

Taking this slightly off topic...

Why is the CHT temp sensor the only one available? We all know how
dependant it is on ambient temperature, and hence is drastically
inaccurate. Colin pulls over and points his infrared hand-held sensor
at his heads to get a reading, but that isn't 100% accurate either
because you have to pull over.

This is a $25 IR temp guage. It's like Colins, point and click, so
still requires pulling over. It also maxes out at 428 degrees. It has
+/- 2% accuracy.

But what if someone made them with a 12v connector and a remote
display? The IR head could be mounted pointing at the head (maybe
drill a small hole in the tin above the left head) and have it capture
the temp every 30 seconds or something.

Am I off in LaLa land? Or can this be done? Any EE's here want to
design it and send it to Taiwan to be build and sold to Empi? =D I
know I'd love to have one...
