Subject: Re: [T2] Missing wire to flasher switch and weird

Also, you might want to check the flasher switch. They
can come apart and cause your symptoms - although i'm
sure the water in the relay is the culprit.

I have a small ziptie holding mine together right now
and it works great...any nodbody knows..except for you
guys... ;p

&gt; &gt; I'm having problems with the turn signals and
&gt; &gt; emergency flashers also.  They light up, but
&gt; &gt; don't flash.  I suspect the relay and have now
&gt; &gt; pulled it.  It was full of water!  Gotta get that
&gt; &gt; windshield seal/rust problem fixed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; If you don't want it to happen again repair the
&gt; windshield leak and then
&gt; replace the flasher.  If you can't fix the
&gt; windshield right now go ahead and
&gt; get a spare relay when you get one and a FLAPS one
&gt; works fine.
&gt; 
&gt; This helped me on mine.  Hope it helps for you..
&gt;
