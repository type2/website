Subject: Re: [T2] Re: plastic sheeting-cab door goo

Dave Horrigan sends:

&gt; A light bulb has just come on in my head (gotta sweep up in there).  Hands
&gt; up anyone who's had a magazine with a reply card or similar stuck inside it.
&gt; That glue they use that's really gloopy and sticky but comes off without
&gt; leaving a mess - that would be ideal for this job.  Thing is, does anyone
&gt; know where to get it from?  Ideally it would come in a cartridge (like
&gt; silicone) and you could just run a bead round the door - voila, perfect
&gt; seal!

Go to http://www.rrdonnelley_dot_com/contact/ and ask this there.

RR Donnelley is one of the biggest magazine publishers in the world; they
use this stuff by the carload. Unfortunately for you, that's how they buy
it, too--and in 55-gallon drums, to boot. It's a form of rubber cement.

The guy who came up with this system got the idea from a news story about
the making of Hostess cupcakes.

Hmmm.._dot_come to think of it, they still sell rubber cement in little jars. As
long as the paint on the inside of your door's still good, the rubber cement
would peel off if you were to use that to hang the plastic sheeting.
