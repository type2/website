Subject: Cylinder Head Nuts--1600DP

Howdy Volks,
I've run the top end 1641 Dual port rebuild for a couple hundred miles now.
Runs strong, good power, but gradually that dreaded ticking sound has
appeared and gotten louder.  Started that the noise appeared only when warm
and when revved above idle, like 1400 rpm and up.  The ticking isn't always
the same volume, it varies some.  Hoping that the problem isn't in the
bottom end, it doesn't appear only on deceleration like the classic rod
slap, I figured I'd retorque the cylinder head nuts.  Only being able to
reach the four lower nuts, the head on 1&amp;2 was tight to spec, but on 3&amp;4
three of the lower nuts were loose.  It took about a half turn each to get
to 23 ft. lb.  I figure those upper nuts have loosened up as well.  My
question, is it reasonable to get off the cylinder shroud without pulling
the engine to get at these upper nuts.  Looks like that shroud is under all
the others plus there is the nice snug engine seal.  Has anyone done this?
Thanks all, the list has been lots of help and entertaining as well.
