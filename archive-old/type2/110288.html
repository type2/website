Subject: Re: [T2] Engine cutting out

Hi Paul,

We need more info: What year bus, and what engine/fuel system do you 
have?

If it is a dual-carbed 72-74 1.7/1.8L, I'd suspect either a vacuum leak 
or an electric lead has fallen off a solenoid on a carb.  This has 
happened to my bus on occaision.

The backfires are probably related to exhaust leaks: did you use fresh 
gaskets when you reassembled it?

Happy trails,

&gt;  Hi everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering whether you could help.  On the way back form the 
&gt; Vanfest
&gt; this weekend my bus appeared to cut out when coming to a stop - 
&gt; especially
&gt; once the clutch had been pressed.  It's been back firing for some time 
&gt; now
&gt; since  I change my exhaust.
