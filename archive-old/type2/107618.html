Subject: VW powered other stuff (Friday)

On the Friday topic of the VW sawmill, I'm currently fixing an industrial
sprayer used by a local tobacco farmer that is powered by a 1.8 water cooled
VW engine, same as in a Jetta/Golf of the mid 80s. Funny that the company
that made these babies was based out of North Dakota, but chose to use a VW
engine. Instead of FI, it uses a carb and the tranny, by the way, is the
same type used in a Type 2! How's that for a paring? She tops out at 40 mph
on a flat road and her huge (gotta be like 3-4' across) wheels. A pic of
what it kinda looks like,

i'm working on is taller. I understand they used to make them with the air
cooled engine too, but not much info out there on that.

On the same subject... if anyone has a line on an exhaust manifold for an
1980s diesel water engine with the square flange on the end of the 4-1
manifold, drop me a line. The one on this sprayer is cracked and someone
said he thought the diesels had that square flange. The gas engines are all
round on the 4-1.

Thanks!
