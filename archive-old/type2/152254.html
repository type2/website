Subject: Re: [T2] Dead Van in SF Update (Final!!!) ;-) trip report

&gt; In 3 years I've been waved at less than 5 times by other VW owners. Maybe once by a Vanagon driver.

But, what I should have added was: Back home in Oregon, almost *every* Bus
or Vanagon driver gives the &quot;V&quot; symbol. Heck, it's not uncommon to get
waves from VW car drivers.

But, we do get more waves when we are in our Bay. The Vanagon's are just
&quot;too new&quot;. ;-)

&gt; Welcome to the Bay Area! :-)

Gawd, I hate traffic. We generally take the train, or other form of PT
when traveling more than 100 miles from home. Shoulda done that on the way
down.

&gt; I always stop at that Chevron for an an A&amp;W root beer.

;-) There is an old guy named Don that pumps gas at that Chevron. He'll
talk your ear off, if permitted. He's a hoot.
