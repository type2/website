&gt;Who has successfully put an altimeter in their bus, and become pleased 
&gt;with what they bought?

I bought a cheap one from an area FLAPS for $20. It woks great for the 
price. The outer ring spins to let you set the altitude for the current 
pressure. When I was going over a pass I checked it's accuracy, by setting 
it at a sign for 1000 feet, and then reading it off at a sign reading 3000 
feet. It was about 100 feet low,
which I figure is close enough for me. There are photos of this, as well as my
bus and it's trailer hitch here:

I am glad to know that my hitch is at least mounted in a half way decent way!

If anybody can't find one of these altimeters and wants one let me know, 
and we can make arrangements for me to ship you one.
