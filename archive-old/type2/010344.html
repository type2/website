Greetings type 2 friends;

Well, I've finally got a new engine in my 71 westy.  Getting a new engine 
was a long and challenging process, but ultimately well worth the time and 
effort.

Back in July, I ordered one of those new mexican longblocks from Beetlemex.  
This engine took about two weeks to arrive and was shipped basically loose 
in a cardboard box.  It had some damage to the case--two of the tin bosses 
on the bottom were broken off. Am I going to accept that?

NO!

So, I waited about 2 months for my damage claim to be processed by the 
trucking company, and finally I got a full refund.  That same day I ordered 
an engine from Ronnie at the Old Volks Home of Az (www.type2parts_dot_com).  
Ronnie's new Mexican longblocks are shipped in a cardboard box strapped to a 
wooden palate, much better than just a box alone...but, as you shall see, 
nothing is fool proof.

The main difference between the Beetlemex/GEX new mexican engines and the 
one's everyone else sells, is that the beetlemex engines are built on a 
mexican case designed for the mexican beetles, while the others are built on 
universal brazilian replacement cases, specifically for export as 
replacement engines, both are built by VW de Mexico.  The beetlemex cases 
are not drilled or tapped for the rear engine support bar {moustache bar}.

Anyway, Ronnie got an engine to my door in 4 days.

Unfortunately, one of our local idiots (every town has 'em) missed the 
palate with the fork lift and rammed the side of the engine, badly damaging 
the push tubes and rods.

Engine #2 went back...

Did Ronnie make me wait for this trucking company (a different one than the 
first trucking company) to process a damage claim?

NO!

He shipped me another engine, right away, he didn't even wait until he got 
that one back, and I can't think of anyone else who would have done this!  
We are, after all, talking about over a thousand dollars worth of 
merchandise here...

So, I got engine #3 about 10 days after I ordered engine #2, and it was 
totally unmolested by the trucking company.

Thank you, Ronnie!!!

This engine came last Friday, just in time for a weekend installation.  
Working on it Friday night and most of the day on Saturday, getting 
everything *just right*, and installed it on Sunday.  Start it up and it 
sounded beautiful, ran like the proverbial clock.  It was really too bad 
that another one of our local idiots (hey, every town has 'em) down at the 
local alternator shop, didn't bother to test the quality of his workmanship, 
and another local idiot (namely, myself) didn't bother to test it either... 
and did the generator generate?

NO!

So, out comes engine #3 installation #1.  Pull the generator, take it back 
down to the local alternator shop, they test it, and its fired (the field 
wires were shorting).  So, using a different core they had laying around, 
they rebuild another generator, I supervise, they test it... I test it... it 
works...  They tell me they're sorry for it not working the first time, but 
after all, &quot;that's why call those volkswagens 'Hitler's Revenge'.&quot;

I am however, please to report, that engine #3 installation #2 is a fabulous 
success.  That new engine is soo nice, and it runs soo smooth.  I can't even 
hear it driving in traffic.  Not a single oil leak... Wonderful.

So today, I get a bill from trucking company #2 that delivered engines #2 
and #3 stating that I owe an extra $62.50 for shipping, stating higher fuel 
costs as the reason.  Do you think they have a snowball's chance in hell of 
getting one red cent out'a me?

NO!

In conclusion, the moral of this story is be nice to strangers and try to 
give a little something to charity now and then.... No wait, the moral of 
this story is order you engine from Ronnie and test that generator before 
installation...

So, there you have it... As Garp said, &quot;We'll take it, the chances of 
another airplane hitting this house are astronomical!&quot;

Laissez Les Bon Temps Rouler,

Brian
