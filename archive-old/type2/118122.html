&gt; alternator 

Hello Guys  This is one of those problems that you really need special tools 
to check, I use a snap-on tested just for alternator testing, there should be 
some cheap in-line amp testers out there. You might have your local shop test 
it for you on the car, this way you determine if it's the alt or regulator. 
Could save you some time and money.  Later and have fun  Mark  Dearing  Salem
