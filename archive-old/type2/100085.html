I had this problem.

&gt; can be mounted in the original mirror frame?  Or does one completely

German made Hagus mirrors are the closet thing to OEM. They are $25 at Bus
Depot when they are in stock.  You won't believe how clear they are compared
to your old mirrors.

My original mirrors had a plastic bead around the edge that looked nice when
new but after years of wear it had cracked and pieces were missing. These
replacements don't have the bead a such but are still nice.
