&gt; &gt; Is there such thing as a nice SMALL antenna for a CB. I'm interested in
&gt; &gt; making my CB permanent when my bus goes back on the road [...] What I'd like to
&gt; &gt; have is a small antenna to add to the rear of the pop top
&gt; &gt; (permanently mounted) like the late model VW's use (Beetles, Passat,
&gt; &gt; Jetta). Those are AM/FM antennas but is it possible to use one for a CB
&gt; &gt; without killing the CB's range badly? I use my radio for 'road reports' (CH
&gt; &gt; 19) and to communicate with friends when travelling together.
 
On my '73 I placed the antenna in the middle of the luggage rack.  This antenna is spring steel, about 42&quot; and base loaded with a magnetic mount.  The metal in that area acts as a ground plane and the flexibility of the whip and magnet allow me to drive through low overheads without any breakage as the antenna just gets knocked over.  In this position with a stock CB and in flat country send and receive  have been up to 25 mi. (40 km.)

Good luck good buddy.

Ian
