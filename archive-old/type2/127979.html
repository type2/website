&gt; Already talked to the scrapper. Dealing directly with the

&gt; $150 for them to haul it off -- flatbed (no wheels) or standard tow (we
&gt; leave the wheels) didn't seem to matter.

&gt; Every one of them said that around here about the only way to get rid of a
&gt; stripped vehicle is to get it to the (only) nearby scrapyard.

Back in the Olde Dayes I had a roommate who was stuck with a rotary (and
blown) engine Mazda that, even though complete, the wrecking yards
wouldn't touch.  He ended up removing the license and VIN plates and
parking it a couple of blocks down the street.  A few days later his
problem disappeared.
