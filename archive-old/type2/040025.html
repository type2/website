Subject: RE: Coating for rubber parts

Try SilBlades by Specialty Silicone Products. After a while you get a
coating kinda like Rain-X so if you don't like Rain-X, don't bother with
silicone windshield wipers. The cool thing is they're not really affected by
UV. These wipers are guaranteed for 5 years against the sun's affect... WOW!

SilBlades also come in a bunch of different colors (the silicone) like,
gray, blue, red, green, teal, pink, and of course black. The wiper arm
itself is black no matter what color of silicone you decide to buy. You can
order them by calling (800)342-5919 or www.sspinc_dot_com

PS: They also sell a bunch of different silicone based lubricants from
greases to light oils to include heavy duty industrial based lubes and
elastomeric membranes which could be use for gasket material on things that
don't want to seal... I personally haven't tried it yet but I can think of
those pesky valve cover seals as one place I might give this a try.

The sun here in St. Pete is murder on everything, and I have to replace my
wipers four or five times a year because of uv degradation.
