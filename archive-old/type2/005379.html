I remember years ago a mexican citizen (list member) had brought one over.
According to her you could bring it in the country as long as you were a
Mexican citizen and the bus was registered in Mexico.  She lived in the
states a few months out of the year. She had offered it for sale in the
states,  Never heard what happened to it though. Anyone else remember that?
