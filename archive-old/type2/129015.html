Digicam is broken, I'd have to burn up some pix on a 'one time use' I 
have and get them developed.

One a quick note: other than a few spots of surface patina there is no 
rust on this bus. It sat under a pine tree the last decade or more. In 
California.

It was backed into something that busted the rear passenger's side tail 
lens, small dent in panel (very small) otherwise the shell is in great 
shape. Still have chrome ring; light was covered with red plastic 
pending lens replacement.

Doors open and close with a satisfying thunk, paint is a metallic teal; 
a bit oxidized over the past twenty years or so.
