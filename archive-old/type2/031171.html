&gt; Quick question for all about the tire pressure. If the placard in the bus
&gt; wants 40psi and the tires are only rated for 35psi max, do I only inflate to
&gt; the 35psi or should I go ahead and inflate to 40psi?
&gt; 
NEVER EVER exceed the max. pressure listed on the tire sidewall, no matter
what the sticker on the vehicle says.  

This just probably means you don't have the proper tires on your Bus.  You
should inflate them to 35 psi, check the load ratings on the tires, and if
they are not correct, start saving for new tires.

If your tires are the correct size and load rating and can handle the
pressure recommended on the sticker, then you should inflate to that
pressure.
