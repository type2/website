&gt; I'm looking to purchase a winch for my bus.  I guess it would have to be

&gt; about just that:  Where to mount it?

The back isn't such a bad idea.  If you're stuck, do you really want to
continue in the direction that got you stuck?

&gt; I could probably drill holes in the front bumper for a mount, but the 
&gt; last thing
&gt; I want to do is mount it somewhere that's gonna cause damage when
&gt; i put load on it...

You have to have a mount that is capable of taking a load that is greater
than the weight of the bus.  If the bus is well-stuck, that is the pull it
takes to get it out.

The only way to do it properly is to make a custom bumper that attaches to
the frame.  In a bus, that means to the front axle mounts or to the
torsion housing region.

Have you considered something simpler, like a come-along?
