Subject: Re: [T2] Friday: Trip report and toy spotting

Can you remember the name of the campground or be more
specific on where it is?  I'm in Tennessee and don't
know it.  Thanks...KR

&gt; 
&gt; Judging by the license plates I saw when wandering
&gt; around the
&gt; campground, this particular campground is a favorite
&gt; of the &quot;locals&quot;.
&gt; The &quot;short way&quot; in is about eight miles of twisty
&gt; turny one-lane gravel
&gt; road that takes about 20 minutes to drive, which is
&gt; probably an effective
&gt; filter.  There is another way in (which I didn't
&gt; drive) but it's about
&gt; 15 to 20 miles of gravel road.  I saw some
&gt; fifth-wheel campers in the
&gt; campground and I think they took the &quot;long way&quot; in -
&gt; I'm not sure if
&gt; you could get a fifth wheel through the &quot;short way&quot;.
&gt;  The reward for
&gt; putting up with the gravel road is a small
&gt; campground (about 25 spaces)
&gt; that is full of tall trees and has a creek running
&gt; alongside.  It's
&gt; about 10-15 degrees cooler there than it is down in
&gt; the valley.
