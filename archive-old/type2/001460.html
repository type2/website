Bob,

I've heard that wide range multiweights (like 10w40) are no longer
recommended by car manufacturers due to problems with gumming up the rings.
Supposedly some viscocity enhancers break down at high temp and gum things
up.

When I bought my bus (77) it had about 100k on it. The service records
showed changing oil every 7k miles (yikes) and 20w50 and 10w40 were the
weights used. I had low compression on one cylinder (90 psi). After about
25k miles of using 10w30 or 30w (depending on season) and changing oil every
2k miles, that bad cylinder now has over 115 psi compression.

A lot of people run synthetic - due to the high temps of air cooled engines.

Just thought I'd relay my opinions. In the end, I think that changing oil
often is the most important factor.
