This rings a bell- as I recall, the drain pipe is glued in after the
cabinet is placed, and you can't tip/lift it without interference- the
couple I've pulled we cut the pipe (pull the shelves, pull the square of
wood behind the shelves; pipe is exposed.)  Just glue a coupler over the
pipe cut on reinstall.
