Subject: Downtown San Diego

Hi Folks,

I recently moved to downtown San Diego, with my well-kept
chrome-yellow/white 77' Westy.  A few days later as I was walking near 10th
Av., I got something of a shock as my Bus drove by headed for the on-ramp to
I-5/163!  A double-take and closer examination as it passed revealed that it
wasn't mine after all, but pretty much a dead ringer.  I've seen it several
times since, around quitting time in the same area.  I always look closely
to make sure it's definitely not mine. Just wondering if the owner was on
this forum...if he sees &quot;his&quot; bus being driven away downtown, it's probably
just me!
