ive redone some of my shift bushings also when i changed out the front beam 
make sure you also change or be sure the one in the very front of the shift 
rod is in good shape this will really tighten up the shift pattern one thing 
ive also done was put in one of those shifter kits that they make for the 
beetle shifter the one that goes under the shift lever, what a difference 
they are about 8bucks i got the aluminum one per a list members suggestion a 
while back what a difference all that made hope this helps.                     
                                                                        all
