&gt;   &gt; now one thing I am getting numb about, can't find the static timing

&gt;
&gt; timing shouldn't be a problem.  It will run rough but still run
&gt; consistently.

that's what I thought... right now I'm not trusting anything I think I
know.

&gt; Did you try testing the wiring harness and also change out the spark
&gt; plug wires?

tested most of it and it checked out, haven't gotten to a few things that
really shouldn't matter (guages etc)   didn't have any wires, went to
FLAPS and they didn't have any wire?????? comeon these places aren't
carrying any &quot;real&quot; auto service stuff anymore it seems

&gt; Something is strange about the fact that it runs 5 minutes and then
&gt; dies.  Did you check if you still had good spark after it died?  Did you

yes it still had decent spark

&gt; try starter fluid after it died?  If, after it died and starter fluid
&gt; doesn't get it running again, I'd venture to guess the problem is an

starter fluid didn't get it started.

&gt; intermittent spark problem..

it's an intermittent something, as soon as I think it is elect it does
something to make me think it is fuel etc.

&gt; let's see if we can narrow things down.  Get it running and find out
&gt; what caused it to stop - I think that's your biggest clue.

&quot;IF&quot;  I could get it running I'm pretty sure I will find it, just can't
get it to keep running long enough to check it out. today it didn't hardly
want to run at all, never more than 30-45 seconds or so...ran the
batteries down. it's getting charged now.

I'll bribe you to pay a visit to Baltimore??!?!?!?!

thanks
Bob
