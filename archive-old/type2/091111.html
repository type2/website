Subject: Re: [T2] The blues continues! ARGH!

I was looking through your list of things replaced/set but one set of
things didn't seem to be there. What about the new engine
mechanically? Can you turn the engine by hand? What about main bearing
endplay, did you double check that? What happens if you increase the
idle speed then pull one plug wire at a time? Does it decrease the
engine speed the same all around? Just grasping at straws here, but at
this point sounds like anythings possible.
