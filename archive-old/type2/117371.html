&gt; i plugged all up and should of cranked but in the night after working
&gt; on it for well over 12 hours i tightened the starter bolt for all the
&gt; wireing down and it twisted up onto the plug wire closest to it....
&gt; 
&gt; so last night when i seen what i had done i i untwisted the wire from
&gt; the metal it was touching and hooked the battery back up now at full
&gt; 
&gt; no sparks but yet the starter wined at me only a little and it went
&gt; click click click when I tried to start it by key...

ah ha,, check all your heavy ground wires from the frame to the tranny, I
suspect the load may have caused them to fail if they were less than good
shape to begin with
