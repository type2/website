Subject: Re: [T2] Uniroyal Laredo All Season? - NOT a tire thread, just
  help  needed

Courtney asked:


 I've noticed my 77 has brand new Uniroyal Laredo ASW rated as C tires. Are these adequate for the Westy?

Look on the sidewall for the Max Weight Load in lbs.
What is it?

Look on the sidewall for the size of the tire.
What is it?  Exactly as it is printed, all the letters and numbers.

Look on the sidewall for the max pressure.
What is it?

Look on the sidewall for the ply rating of the tread and the sidewall.
What are they?
