Subject: Re: [T2] to the hot wax goddess

Jon,

I am almost certain it was Bill May on the vintagevw list.

The man should be an inspiration to us all...he knows more about
vw's(bugs) than I thought I ever knew....he loves 67's!

Cheers ,dave

&gt; My exhaust crossover pipe had a short stud from prior life experiences.  
&gt; It was well rusted in and not in a convenient place to put the plot in the

&gt; special Amazonian-carnuba/killer-bee wax blend while chanting various
&gt; incantations to the wax goddess and casting some rose petals.  The next
&gt; day after cooling, further incantations and more rose petals, I applied
&gt; the mystical 4 oz ball pein for a little tap, tap, tap rhythm to loosen
&gt; whatever.  It felt good to me anyway.  A few more and different
&gt; incantations led to application of vice grips from the dark side. The stud
&gt; being too small for the 'goddess approved' stud remover in the tool box. A
&gt; little to the right and a little to the left, back and forth, back and
&gt; forth, and she eased right out. More rose petals and a big sigh of relief.
&gt; 
&gt; Much appreciation to whoever figured this trick out.
