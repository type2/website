Is it a BN2, BN4 or BN6? I got my BN4 for $75.00. Normaly I've seen them
from $150.00-$300.  However, I spent more than $75.00 tracking down missing
duct work and dash switches ( I wanted it to appear to be a factory
installation). If originality is not a concern, as long as the heater is
functioning, you can fabricate missing stuff. Lots of info in the library. I
can e-mail you a drawing/schematic of the entire system- so you can present
to the seller as to it's completeness.

&gt; Hello list, wanted to ask a question about gas heaters,I found on for sale
&gt; on line from a 72 Bus, I have a 74 any problems there? Also what is a fair
&gt; price to pay for one of these with intallation instructions and an
operating
&gt; manual?
&gt; The wife says I can get the heater or buy an original tent to go with the
&gt; Westy, hmmm wha to do what to do!
