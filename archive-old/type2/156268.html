Subject: Re: [T2] Burned wires

zach if you are talking about the starter alternator wireing harness then it may have grounfded out....when going through the tin to the starter....
   
  you might want ot put you a piece of gas hose in that hole thetre and run the wire through that as protection...
  i am only speaking from experience when i harness grounded out and caught fire and melted form the starter to the alternatorleaving my arse pouring out hot smoke till i could get the battery cable off to stop it... which for me was a l;ittle to late since i like really tight battery connections...
   
  it melted everything and i had to refabricate me a wireing harness from radio shack.. not saying this is your problem but sounds alot like that or just a ground out somewheres to cause this..?
   
  good luck

  My main email acocunt isn't working properly at the moment so I signed up
with my gmail account.

I drove my bus a fair distance today to stretch its legs and get more of a
feel for her. She ran great, no heat problems, no power problems,
everything was great. When I got to my destination she died when I came to
a stop. So just making sure everything was okay (I had just finished
replacing the alternator and voltage regulator) I started her up again real
quick. She started but I noticed LOTS of smoke pouring out of the intake
vent on the left. Fearing the worst I shut down and ran to the back to take
stock of the situation. It wasn't burning oil or gas so that was a good
thing, but then I noticed one of the wires inside was definately melted.

I don't have a picture yet because my website is down grrrrrr this has been
happening nightly. But it looks like a heavy gauge wire that runs from the
large gauge wire that connects to the positive batter lead and runs to the
starter. I tried searching the list but don't really know what I am looking
for.

The burnt wire in question is about a 14 ga braided wire and runs through
the firewall near where the starter is.

Any Ideas?

oh yeah, the idiot light was a connection problem. All fixed now.
