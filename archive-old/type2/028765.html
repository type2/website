Subject: Any Canadians need 68-73 Poptop Canvas?

I have a Canadian customer who bought a tan '68-73 Westy poptop canvas and
does not need it.  It is still brand new, in the box.  Before I have him
mail it back here, do any Canadian listmembers want it?  If so, shipping
will be free and there will be no duty or brokerage fees. You will pay only
the price of the canvas (US$199.95). If anyone is interested let me know
within a week or so; otherwise I will tell him to send it back here.
