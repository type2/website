Wow, great memories! When my son was three months old, we bought a brand-new
Westy Weekender. His official spot was the front cot and he loved it. To
keep him from falling out or wandering at night, I cannibalised a mesh net
&gt;from an old playpen. I stitched the bottom side to the edge of the cot,
underneath where the tube for the pipes is attached to the canvas. I
reinforced the top edge and adjusted the tension so that it could be strung
between the seat belt hangers on the door posts.  

It was enough to keep him from falling out, but not a jail. I can still see
his little blond head and blue eyes peering at me, grinning from ear to ear.
Camping was wonderful with a baby in a bus is a lot of fun. Much easier than
a bug!

Now he is six feet tall, in his twenties and has a real job. Time sure flies...
