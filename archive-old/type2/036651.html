Subject: '79 bus torsion arms!! Pleas help

Hi all,
  I have a '79 bus and I am replacing my ball joints and torsion arms...well
trying I have the front end on jack stands and removed the driver sides
lower arm, but for the life of me I can get the top arm off..it is resting
on the upper torsion stop and it is under lots of spring action. What do I
need to do to be able to remove the upper arm. The lower arm slid right off.
Please help. BTW I have done nothing to the passanger side.
