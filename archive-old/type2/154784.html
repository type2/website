Subject: Need a body...

The Mothership body has finally given up the ghost and has started to 
leak badly.  Always did, even when I was traveling, but now its too bad 
to fight any longer.

I am looking for a 1979 transporter body in good shape so I can swap 
out the Mother's engine and prepare her for another journey.

Please contact me if you have one or know of one.

As close as possible to Georgia.  A good price is always appreciated.
