&gt;&gt;Would it be a BAD idea to put 215s in the rear? And 205s in the front?&lt;&lt;

probably so.  stock is usually best. you might also consider contacting
your insurance company &amp; asking them about non-standard equipment &amp; how
it might affect your coverage in an accident.

www.tirerack_dot_com has 2 tires available in the stock size &amp; load rating:
-Michelin Agilis
-Yokohama Y356
-Bridgestone 603V

someone suggested consulting the type2 library for tire information.
that is great advice.

good luck,
