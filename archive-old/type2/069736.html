Subject: 76 Mileage

Good Day All,

While I'm catching up on 3 days worth of mail I thought I'd throw a question out 
regarding fuel mileage.  What is the typical fuel mileage for a loaf westy (2000 cc - solid 
lifters)?  For as long as I've had my van, the maximum distance I could travel is around 
300 km (200 mi) _at_ 55-60 mph.  I have gone close to 350 km on a few occaisions but 
arrived at my destination bone dry ( had a jerry can in both cases ).  My odometer 
hasn't worked for 2 years so I'm not sure what the mpg works out to.  A freind just got a 
70 Westy a few months ago with a 1600 SP and said he got almost 500km (300 mi) on 
a full tank.  

Does this sound right?  I know VW's ususally get pretty good mileasge, but mine is 
mediocre at best. Any suggestions of things to check that might help get a few more 
miles??  As far as I can tell there are no gas leaks. The engine is beginning to tire out a 
bit - #3 compression is 50psi, but the mileage has been the same since I got it.  Not sure 
why I waited so long to find out about this.  TIA

BTW, thanks to all who responded about my shifting problems.  It was a combination 
of problems - worn shift coupler and both bushings.  Parts will be here on Thursday :)
