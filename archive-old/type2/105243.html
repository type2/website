Bob,

That would be correct.

The front turnsignal is also the front parking light/side marker (the lens
is visible from the side). It uses a dual filament bulb for this, just as
the brake/tail light does.  Same bulb.  The rear uses a seperate light for
the side marker since the taillight housing isn't visible from the side.
