Subject: Re: [T2] chirping in the engine compartment

I have personally heard a chirping one time on a pancake that had a head 
nut loose. the chirping (best as we could tell) was from the metal 
rubbing together. I would personally not consider trying to push the bus 
any further than it has already. If you have some tools handy, I would 
either do a compression test in the parking lot, or do the old &quot;pull one 
wire at a time&quot; and see which cylinder is giving you the uneven idle. 
Good luck.
