&gt; Meanwhile I'm still trying to get that *&amp;^%^_at_^%$ vent window and frame out.
&gt; Looks like I'm gonna have to get the window out of there before I can remove
&gt; this thing.  I sure would like to know how the guys who wrote the manuals
did
&gt; this!

Did you unbolt the big window and drop it to the bottom?
