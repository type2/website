Subject: Rocker Arms

I think the part number 021 101 397 is the right part number because someone
on the vwvortex gave me the same number.  I went to my local dealer as a first
step.  The guy at the parts counter broke out into laughter when I asked if
they sold those parts anymore.  Then I asked him to look up the part number
and after looking through ETKA for the longest time he could only come up with
the part number for the rocker arms or something else.  I'll try on monday to
go down there armed with the part number and see if they can order it.  I was
amazed at all the helpful responses!!!  Thanks to everyone I am very greatful.
If I can't get them from the dealer then I'll try some of the other leads
here.  Thanks again.  Mark Fischer.
