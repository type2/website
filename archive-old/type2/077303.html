Subject: Weird wire under dash in my 79 Westy

The healight swtich needed replacing so, as I was looking under there and
swtiching wires over to the new swtich, I noticed a wire that had been taped
off and left under the dash near the headlight switch. It is a sky blue
color with two lime green stripes on it. I can't find anything showing this
wire. Does anyone know where it's supposed to hook up to? It has the really
small push on connector on the end, only about 1/8&quot;, so won't fit the usual
size spades.
Help,
Courtney
