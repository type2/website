Hi Folks,
   I know we are going into summer but I'm trying to plan ahead here.  My 
rear window defroster grid is shot and despite having power and ground on 
the side bars, it doesn't work.  I tried repairing the grid lines with the 
special stuff from the flaps, but still no luck.
   I'm wondering if anyone has ever &quot;glued&quot; some kind of fine wire to the 
rear window to make your own defroster.  If you have, please share the 
secret with the rest of us
