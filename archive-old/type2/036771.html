Subject: My first bus!

After thinking about it for the last 6-8 months, a bus showed up for
sale about two minutes from work here, and I picked it up yesterday. A
1970, ugly beigish color, but pretty rust free - a bus guy I worked with
previously came by and gave it a good once over, and proclaimed it
worthwhile. Drove it home yesterday, and it felt pretty good - couldn't
get the stupid grin off my face, in fact!

So, now that it's home and sitting in my garage, I need to know what to
be looking at first (well, third, actually). The brakes pull hard to the
right, so I'm going to go through them on Saturday (probably a wheel
cylinder, right?), as well as doing the 3000 mile stuff and tune-up from
Muir's book. Once those are done, where should I be looking next? My
goal is to have it trustworthy before the end of April, so my wife, dog,
and I can go camping with it!

Looking forward to learning lots,
