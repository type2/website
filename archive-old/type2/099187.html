Subject: Re: [T2] customer service by Bus Depot - a long posting

David,

The floor mats are sweet.  Heavy rubber and good quality.  Also the rear 
didn't have the holes cut out for the middle seat - i have the seat but 
have choose not to install it at this time.  I believe that the Bus 
Depot has good products at a fair price.  I have found that the rubber 
seals at Rock Mountain Motor Works are better fitting - both window and 
door.  I know this by getting a complete set from the Bus Depot first 
and then having to buy all the door and front window seal again through 
RMW - better fit.

&gt;Any how, how do the floor mats fit? I would like to
&gt;buy a set in the future. Did yours appear to be good
&gt;quality?
