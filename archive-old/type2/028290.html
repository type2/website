Meredith-

The double-relay in my '79 is unpainted metal, but one of our busses may
have had it replaced at one point.  It does go on the firewall, towards the
left-hand side IIRC.  You will probably need to go to a VW parts place to
get one, either locally or online.

Another possibility for your symptoms is a bad rotor (in the disributor).  I
had one go bad, and as soon as it got too hot it would stop passing current.
You've *probably* got something else going on, but a rotor is cheap and easy
to replace, so it'd be worth a shot.

Cheers,
Alistair
'79 Westy

&gt; I am under the impression that the dual relay switch is the little light
&gt; blue box on the rear of the fire wall.  I just tried to buy a replacement
&gt; for it at the closest auto parts store, that being checker, and they had
&gt; nothing.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;   I would like to put a new one of those on it.  Where do I need to go to
&gt; find a replacement?
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; My  problem again is that I am driving fine and then all of a
&gt; sudden after a
&gt; few hours of driving, the RPMs drop and the engine won't start.  It turns
&gt; over but won't start.  When it dies there is no sputtering, no signs of
&gt; overheating on my gauges and after sitting overnight it starts up fine.
