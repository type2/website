Subject: VW valve adjusters? + why I have switched to lurk mode

Has anyone on the list had any luck with aftermarket adjusters? Or found 
some original VW adjusters? I got some from Bus Depot a year ago. They 
won't stay adjusted, and they are now pretty badly pitted!

Personal note, for those who care, with bus content:

I have gone to lurking because I have to complete two books in two years. 
The first one is coming along nicely, but I am anxious to get it out of 
the way so that I can get to work on the second book. It is about the 
American Geographical Association's Transcontinental Excursion of 1912. 
In August through July of 1912, 43 European geographers joined more than 
70 American geographers for a field trip across the continent and back. 
On a train specially made up for the excursion, they traveled from New 
York to Yellowstone NP, where they stayed a week, then to Seattle, down 
to San Francisco, where they given a party by John Muir, then over to 
Denver, down and back to Arizona, and returning to New York across the south.

In addition to translating scientific papers about the United States 
written in German, French, Czech, Italian, etc. etc., my major research 
effort will be to drive pretty much every inch of the excursion's route in 
Peregrine. I will be building a balanced '78 motor for that. Right now I 
just want to adjust the valves and have them stay that way (they are 
opening up, not closing).
