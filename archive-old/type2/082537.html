Subject: Re: [T2] Generator Removal Uhhh!

The thermostat shouldn't affect things.  Reach around the front of the
shroud and make sure that the fan is loose on the hub, and make sure that
the washers and shims are removed from the front of the fan.  If the fan
is frozen to the hub it will make things hard to remove.

&gt; Hello Everyone--
&gt;
&gt; I emailed the list about two days ago with my troubles removing the intake
&gt; manifold in my 71 1600dp engine...well I am still at it believe it or
&gt; not...and I am on the verge of Losing it! I am still in the process of trying
&gt; to remove my generator so I can slide the intake manifold out.
&gt; I have removed the four bolts on the front of the Generator Plate, removed
&gt; the Generator strap, removed the belt, removed the 36mm nut behind the shroud
&gt; that I assume attaches the Generator to the fan, and I thought that was all I
&gt; had to do...and the thing would come out and up...but it seems snagged on
&gt; something and I sure don't want to force it. I keep reading about some
&gt; Thermostat attachment but Where is it?
&gt; Thanks for your help.....I am attempting this process with the engine still
&gt; in the bus...just so everyone knows.
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely--
