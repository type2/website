Subject: engine, transmission swap-back to *almost* stock

Decided to take my 71 back to stock this past week.   Removed the 1776
complete turnkey engine w/dual Kadron *40mm* carbs, and the IRS  bus
transaxle
*recently built by Rancho Performance-Transaxles* w/4.57 ring &amp; pinion.
Replaced them with a stock 1600 DP *complete turnkey* engine with stock dual
vacuum advance dizzy, and a stock IRS bus trans, that was removed from the
70 sportsmobile that I picked up over the holidays.

Will now be running smoooth, and cool, in So Cal.  No! not planning on
lowering it, just keeping it simple.

BTW,  We will be taking the 1776 *built- turnkey* engine,  and the *freeway
flyer* trans,  to Pomona next week,  along with another load of new, and
some used,  bus part bargains for sale..........
