&lt;&lt;I have to do this or I will go insane. I have stood it beyond
endurance.

It's &quot;kharma&quot;. K-H-A-R-M-A. Not &quot;karma&quot;. Stop spelling it like that.
Please, please stop.

&quot;Gauge&quot;. &quot;Definitely&quot;. Okay, I'll stop. But if you are going to withold
kharma from one another, or pass it around, or whatever you do with it,
for God's sake spell it right&gt;&gt;

You may be thinking of dharma or (is it?) kharman ghia.Just to be sure,
I checked about a half dozen texts that are used to teach world
religions (which I teach at a local college) but found no alternative
spelling.

So I'm afraid that I won't stop spelling it 'karma'.
