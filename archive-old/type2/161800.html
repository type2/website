You have a few choices...

A steady hand while drilling works. Especially if you do a smaller pilot
hole first.

A sawzall with a shorty blade works well.

A pnumatic cut-off wheel makes quick work. If there is limited clearance you
can cut into the bolt/shaft either vertically or horizontally enough to get
a chisel to bite.

A hardened chisel and hammer will work, but it will take a while. You have
to be careful not skip into other parts of the exhaust.

A good-old hacksaw or shorty hand-hacksaw works but they bend pretty easily.

A big pair of bolt-cutters will work if there is enough bolt shaft to bite
into.

Hope this helps

&gt;These nuts are so rusty/rounded off that a regular socket just spins around
the nut.  I hope thats not too confusing.
I'd rather not use a torch on these guys since I've never really used one
before..so does anyone have any extra ideas?
