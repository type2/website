Subject: Window Regulator

Hello everyone,
      I owna 77 westy and the window regulator was
really rough, so I tried to take it out.  Well...it
snapped in the process at the end renduring it
useless.  I ordered a new one and now I'm having a
hard time puting it in.  It looks like the shaft in
between the window and vent window needs to be
removed, but the window glass is in the way.  Any help
would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks a lot.

Tim
