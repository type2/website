Subject: Re: [T2] To Sipe or not to Sipe?

I had it done by Discount Tire when I bought the worst set of tires I've
ever owned for my 87 Westy---

Hard as a rock Yokohama 356-D's.

There were like driving on ball bearings when it was wet &amp; with snow on
the ground.

They did squish out the water OK--and worked better in snowy conditions,
but still wern't really that good.

They wore out in 25,000 miles, and I think from what I have heard --it's
the nature of that tire to wear out pretty fast .

Siping is a good thing--look at the face of a Nokian Hakkapalita--their
siped from the factory and are great tires in the winter.
