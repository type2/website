Subject: Re: Stainless T4 Exchangers For Real?

I thought my Stock heat exchangers were stainless. Please correct me 
if I am wrong but mine are a stainless steel looking and acting 
substance.

&gt; 
&gt; HEELLLLOOO, We have been asking about SS boxes for the T4 for
&gt; YEARS and finally we find out the Brits have been holding back!!
&gt; 
&gt; WE WANT YOUR SOURCES AND NOW, HOW MUCH, WHEN, WHERE, BULK ORDER?
&gt; ARE VANAGON BOXES AVAILABLE OR JUST BUS, WE NEED TO KNOW.
