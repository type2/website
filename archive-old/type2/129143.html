Subject: Re: [T2] VERY DANGEROUS TO SWITCH TO ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP

 What are the threads on this switch? Are they compatible with the VW oil
pressure switch? This would be perfect for my HiPer 2276 CC bug engine with
a Holley pump.
regards,
Courtney

  &gt;the pump receives its power via an oil pressure switch
 
Old technology.... Chevy Vega did this over 30 years ago. They used a 3
terminal oil pressure sending unit. 1
wire to the light and 2 wires for the fuel pump. When the oil pressure came
up, the switch lost ground and the
light went out; same as all others. But the other 2 wires completed a
circuit when the pressure came up; so
the fuel pump ran. Here is a pic of the sender:
