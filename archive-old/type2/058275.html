Hello All!

I'm relatively new to the list (by digest).  Just &quot;Inherited&quot; a '68 station
wagon from my father-in-law (FIL) in Canada (I live in Montana - legally
imported bus, very easy).  It's my project vehicle for the forseeable future.
I got the Muir and Bentley manuals, and cannot find an engine number which
matches.  Mine is B 0066943, not B5XXXXXX like everything I can find says it
should be.  My FIL says he had the engine rebuilt about 10k mi ago and claims
it's an 1800 or 1900.  Everything looks pretty stock 1600 to me, and I'm
pretty sure the case is original.  Anyway, anybody know anything about engine
(or anything else, for that matter) information that is specific to Canadian
type 2's?  Does anybody know of any resources for such information?  

Also, Ja, es gibt andere Deutsche hier an der Liste.  (Yes, I'm part German
and speak it - if anybody wants help translating any VW stuff I'd be glad to
help)

Thanks in advance,

Markus Bahnemann
