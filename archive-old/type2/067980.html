Subject: Re: engine from a 411 in a 72 Westy???

&gt;I also have been talking to a guy in New Hampshire about a engine from
&gt;a 1971 type 4 VW (411). What would it take to put this engine in my 72
&gt;Westy, can I use the same ehaust and carbs, since this is a more
&gt;powerful engine??
&gt;
&gt;Here is the ad from which I want the engine,
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1971 80hp Type 4 engine...This is one powerful puppy!
&gt;&gt; Your 411,412, or Type 2 bus/westy is begging for this motor!
&gt;&gt; Would fit nicely in either of the above mentioned vehicles,
&gt;&gt; only $500!

Unless I'm very much mistaken, a '71 Type 4 used basically the same 1700cc 
motor as used in a '72 bus.  I don't see why it would any more powerful 
than your original motor.  And yes, you could use the same exhaust and 
carbs, although you may have to switch intake manifolds, I'm not sure.
The only major difference is that the oil filler tube and/or dipstick (I 
forget which) is/are located up top on the type 4 motor rather than at the 
back of the motor.  Without a top engine hatch in your '72 bus, this could 
be very inconvenient.  I believe that you can modify the type 4 motor 
accordingly, though.

&gt;And should I go the route of getting a used engine and possible
&gt;rebuilding mine later or go for rebuilding mine now (with a high cost as
&gt;my heads are only good for paper weights). I only have about $500 - $600
&gt;dollars to spend at the moment.

I think your last statement may answer your own question.  I'm not you 
could rebuild your motor and buy a rebuilt set of heads for $500-$600.  
Although it would probably be the best alternative if you could. $500 seems 
to me to be only a so-so price for a used '71 type 4 motor.  For this 
price, it should be in very good shape.  Personally, I wouldn't pay $500 
for such a motor unless I tested compression and it was close to new spec 
(say, 135 lbs or more and relatively even all around).  If the motor is 
already out, you will need a transaxle or bellhousing, a starter, and a 
battery to test compression.
