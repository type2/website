See the sad story of how General Motors, Standard Oil, Firestone, et al, =

I had heard a number of times that General Motors actually bought up all
the cable-car and trolleys in the US and ripped up the tracks -
----------------- Clip ---------------------------
I heard the same thing but it related to GM selling rubber tired busses.
Most drivers also hated the exposed tracks because tires were pretty =
poor
back then and running parallel on tracks killed tires pretty quickly. =
All
just rumor though.
