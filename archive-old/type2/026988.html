Question was asked on a '77 Westy;  how do you modify the z-bed so that you 
can keep the table up all the time.

I simply use the small white table top from an early Vanagon.  It fits snug 
against the left side, right over the cooler/cabinet.  I can sit two people 
back there with no problem.

When I go out at noon for my lunch snack, I just unloosen the screw on the 
'L' leg, and swing the table into position.  Then I can also get to my 
cooler.

When I want to take a nap after the snack, I lift the small white table top 
off the 'L' leg, put it on the floor, and swing the 'L' leg over my cooler, 
out of the way.

When it is time to stash the setup, I bungee cord the small white tabletop 
behind the passenger seat, and put the 'L' leg in the spare tire cabinet.  
It easily fits.

The larger white Vanagon table top will also work, but may need to have the 
base re-aligned to suit your needs.

The original '78 table top is somewhere in my basement; I will probably 
never use it.
