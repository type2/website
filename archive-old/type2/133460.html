&gt; Well Danny (the guy stuck) can't catch a break it sounds like. I drove

sure sounds like it, bummer, wonder he doesn't just buy a bus ticket, take
the tags off and leave it somewhere..

&gt; His old engine has about .075&quot; endplay, and the new one is only
&gt; slightly better at .065&quot;. The new engine actually only had a small

I'm not that familiar with the type 1 engine has been many many years
since I worked on one.

&gt; right now. There is a chance he might just go for it to get back to
&gt; family in AZ.

I don't think I would spend any more money at this point, but rather make

start driving and if/when it fails just rent a truck and trailer and haul

don't know how his spirits could still be up, I think you would be pulling
me down out of a nearby tree and fitting me for a white coat with real
long sleeves......

&gt; those things that happens when on the road. If he decides to chance it
&gt; I'll post again.

keep us up to date thanks, not one his route but will be thinking of him
and wishing good vibes, make sure he has an up to date AIRS list for his
route
