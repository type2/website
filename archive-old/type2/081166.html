Subject: Ouray.  No bus content at all, but it's Friday...

we stopped in Oray and went swimming in the huge pool in
&gt;town fed by natural spring waters. What a great way to
&gt;unwind after a drive like that.

Ah, Ouray.  I almost hate to mention it, as I hope it stays like it is until
I hit the lottery and can go there permanently.  They have this outdoor pool
complex that is in (if I remember correctly) five sections, divided by
top-of-the-water height walls between the contiguous pools.  The hottest is
like the hottest hot tub you could really enjoy, all natural hot springs
water, up to your waist or so.  It's what, maybe 30' square?  More?  Soak a
while under the stars.  Then you roll over the wall and into the next pool,
a little cooler with river water mixed in, and up to your chest.  Swim
around, catch snowflakes on your tongue, then roll over the next wall to a
slightly cooler pool, up to your chin.  Swim laps, point out constellations
to your kids, wonder how many other places there are like this.  Keep going
from one pool to the next, each larger and not so hot, until you're in the
deep end of the biggest pool, a full size race worthy pool with a diving
end.  Year 'round, a stars only roof on the place.

I wouldn't spend a week in Disneyworld if you paid me to, but my Ouray
postcard lives in my cubical at work, just to remind me there really are
places like that.

And there's a  B&amp;B there that has a natural hot tub grotto in the basement.
Honest.

Sigh.

OK, before Friday is over:  what's the coolest place you've been to with
your bus, or want to take it back to?
