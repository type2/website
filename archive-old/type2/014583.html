Subject: headliner material (front of 77 westy)
Message-ID: &lt;2500c0bf.249809cf_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

does  anyone know where I can get just the front part of the headliner for a 
77 westy.  I think bus depot sells the whole liner (for a non westy bus) but 
it's about $150 and I only need the front.

If anyone has any ideas please let me know.

It appears to be a very off white plastic type shelf paper (couldn't find a 
match in shelf paper or wall paper at home depot) that has a basket weave 
type texture.

Thanks,
Mike
