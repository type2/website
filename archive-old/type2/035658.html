Subject: Re: Valve adjustments

With an automobile that will go unnamed (British, very small, name 
reflects the latter fact) I got into the habit of setting valves by 
facing the vehicle up an almost imperceptable grade, putting it in fourth 
gear, and pulling backwards to find TDC. A brick (ie, chock) slides under 
a rear wheel when I find the marker. This works well with a bus, too.
