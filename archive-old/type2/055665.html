Sorry to hear about your loss, Gerald.  I purchased one of these dividers from
listmember Rennie Wible of Cali (from his 58 panel, i think) and wanted to let
you know that i could make a template of it or whatever once it arrives if
that would be of any importance to you.  Its sad to see that even some
volkspeople (hmm.. people's people..) are jerks.   Hope the rest of the show
season treats you better!
