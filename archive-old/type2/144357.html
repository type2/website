  parts)

Back on topic...

Any number of fine natural and synthetic waxes exist at all sorts of price
points.  In the rare case that I own a bus deserving of a wax I tend to
look for a wax with a high carnauba wax content. They all last a couple
months at best, as they all wear off except....

SILCONE WAXES

One thing to really look for if you want to keep your bus is &quot;waxes&quot;
containing silicon in large amounts.  These waxes are usually advertised
to last for long peiods of time and, by gum, they do!  That is both their
blessing and their curse.  If you choose to use a silicon-base wax, be
prepared for auto-body HELL the next time you need any paint applied to
your bus!  The silicones last forever because they snuggle down into the
existing pain and cannot be removed and they are absolutley incompatible
with any paint.  If you try to paint over this silicone/paint melange, the
new paint will bead right up and roll right off.  The only cure is to sand
back to bare metal and start over.  Vry painful, very expensive and
nowhere near as good as using the existing VW-applied primer/paint
(however badly chalked) as a base.

OOK!
