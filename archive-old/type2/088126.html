Subject: HEATER BOXES

Hi everyone.

I have a 72 van and am going to construct some heater box shells.
I took the old shells off of the heater box fins.
I was just wondering if anyone has dimensions for the shells or a photo of
them or if anyone has ever done this.
The generator fan flaps at the bottom of the engine pushes the air into the
shells,
is this correct?Also the fan blower pushes air into them as well , am I on the
right track?
Just wanted to confirm this is how they work.
I am going to use Aluminum to hold the heat, probably construct it in two
halves and either rivet it together
or self tapping screws. your comments are appreciated.

Darren
