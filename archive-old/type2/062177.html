Hi Jonathan- Ouch!! Sorry about the travails- I did change clutch cable and
acc. cable before out West trip last yr in our '78; old ones actually
looked ok; they're spares now.  All this talk of bad fuel vent lines, I
upped and checked my fire exting., alas, it had discharged because it was
upside down in that little well next to rear seat- no white stuff all over,
I guess just the propellent got out because pull pin was knocked off.  Got
new f.e. (the ABC type, witht the mono\ammonium phospate, well worth the
$13 insurance!  Yes, gas is pretty toxic; I'm reluctant to clamp hoses that
may be brittle and crack; I usually pull the tank side end of filter first
and do the shove the pencil in thing, then deal with new filter and finally
pull the pencil and shove hose onto other end real fast.   What, you lost
an intake manifold bolt (pre FI, or was it an injector bolt (FI??).
     Must deal with exhaust leak at heaterbox jmunction; my stove
cement/fiberglass rope lasted only 3500 mi this time!   BTW, whatever bit
us in NC (chiggeres? Subtle mosquitos?) is still showing welts on SO- she's
very sensitive and you should see the fire ant bites on her ankle after
stepping onto a nest!  The bus did OK even with its odd noises (we were the
slowest thing on the road at 70MPH!!!) and sporadically used a quart of oil
every other tankful or less and gave about 18mpg.
Sounds like your toolbox/spare necessities are expanding- but remember the
law- what we are prepared for never happens!!!!!!   MB
