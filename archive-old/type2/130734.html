Wow, retard *connected* and timed to 7.5 BTDC.

My original distributor was a 022 905 205 AB:

Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC _at_ 800-950 rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) 
connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-11deg Adv _at_ 7.9 In. Hg, 11-13deg Ret 
_at_7.9 In. Hg; Centrifigual: 11-17deg _at_ 2000 rpm, 21-25deg _at_ 3600 rpm

Note that ~12deg retard spec ... i.e. if you eliminate the retard, you 
swing from 5 ATDC to 7.5 BTDC.  Experimentation showed me this indeed 
worked the way I expected it to.

I'm going to guess that your '74 distributor is 021 905 205N?

Timing Set At:: 10deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) 
connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 7-12deg Adv, 16-18deg Ret; Centrifugal: 
9-14deg _at_ 2000rpm, 21-25deg _at_ 3400 rpm

So 10 ATDC, but take away that ~17deg retard and that swings you back 
to ~7.5 BTDC.

So, when your plenum vacuum drops, you are getting a huge &quot;instant 
advance&quot; because the retard is disengaging, immediately popping you 
into the low 20's.

...but then that distributor is supposed to advance *another* ~20+ 
degrees!

I would be really interested to know if your retard side is actually 
working properly, if you're only getting low 30's total.

&gt; So far it runs really well. Full advance brings it up into the low 
&gt; 30's. It runs really well, pulling 70MPH on highway 401 and holding it 
&gt; on all but the worst of the hills.
