Subject: Re: [T2] Holding oil pressure

Richard,

A highly subjective number!  Better to know the oil pressure
while running.

A freshly rebuilt T1 engine with a high pressure blueprinted oil pump 
may take as much as 20 seconds(or longer) while &quot;cool&quot; for 
the oil pressure to come down enough to make the light come back on.

My avp when cool took maybe 5-10 seconds or so..maybe less...

Depends on condition of bearings, oil pump and pressure relief valves
and oil viscosity..

Also note that just cranking it over doesn't really build up the same
pressure as a running engine would.

As John Connaly would probably be quick to point out(although maybe
not on T4 engines), the pressure relief valve often doesn't seal well
against the case...that's why he rents/sells the tool to fix it for T1 
engines.

Cheers, dave
