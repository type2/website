Subject: fuel supply problem

I bought a '79 bus a while ago, which the previous owner had left
sitting for six years with fuel in the tank.

I drained the tank, and installed a new fuel filter and and new rubber
fuel hoses.

Today I tried to start the engine for the first time. It turned over,
but did not start. I pulled off one of the rubber lines to see if fuel
was circulating, and there was no fuel in the line.

I'm wondering why. When I changed the rubber hoses on the fuel lines,
the old fuel flowed out easily, so it didn't seem like the lines
themselves were clogged.

Possibly I need a new fuel pump. Any ideas?
