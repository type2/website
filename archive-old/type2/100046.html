Subject: Fuel gauge won't go to 1/1

I put a new VDO fuel sender in my tank back in March when my engine was out
and I've noticed that when I fill up at the station it only goes to about
3/4 full instead of 1/1.  From 3/4 down to 0 it works just fine and it runs
out of gas at the end of the red where it should.

I know the sender was installed the right way and it seems to be that if it
were backwards it would only be a problem when the fuel was low because of
the bowl inside.

Any ideas?  It's been so long since I had a working fuel gauge I don't know
what the VW behavior is.
