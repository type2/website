I have found craigslist_dot_com to be a fantastic resource to look at VW bus
listings here in the SF Bay area. That is where I found my bus, and we
looked at a couple other ones from craigslist as well. I check it out
everyday and see a VW bus almost daily!

Just in case anyone has wondered about this bus advertised in the San
Francisco area papers:

VW '73 Westfalia
MUST SEE!
Classic restored, exc cond, many xtras. $4500. 916-415-9269

I went to look at it last week and was disappointed.  While the bus is
in good shape, it is not &quot;restored&quot;.  The body is real straight, though
not perfect, the interior and canvas in fairly excellent condition.

He had some pale yellow paint done on the lower half of the bus (what is
that covering up?  Didn't look like the top was done at all, a fair
amount of surface rust in the air intakes), and it's not a quality job,
you can see the buildup line and there are a few blisters where rust is
underneath.  The foam seal was gone, the engine and compartment filthy.
He installed step-ups on the rear below the taillights and awning
brackets on each side of the slider, I din't really dig putting those
holes in the body.  I figger it's worth maybe 3-3.5, but the guy didn't
wanna come down from his 4.5 much AT ALL.

All in all, my Sally is in better shape (before her impromptu hose job),
minus the cheap halfass paintjob and new canvas.

I hauled all the way up to Roseville to look at this one 'cuz I was
remorsing that I blew off the chance to snap up a '76 with 61k original,
first owner, a few weeks ago, for like 3k.  Still berating myself.  Hey,
did one of you listees get it?  SF Bay Area?  It's still in the Mercury
listings haunting me.  Sob.
