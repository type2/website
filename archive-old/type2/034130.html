&gt; I am looking to convert my 74, 1800cc stock dual solex setup to a fuel injection system from a 79 non-California and was wondering if anyone has any experience on doing this.  Basically, what components will need to be replaced?  The following is what I have come up with as far as what will need replaced:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Heads

shouldn't have to change the heads, in fact the easiest way might be to
find the fuel injection system from a 73-74 412 sedan or wagon, these were
almost identical engines and were fuel injection stock, and they are
relitively avaliable at junk yards.  get ALL the parts, or even the whole
engine and swap em.  I have run a 411/412 engine in my 78 and it is a
direct bolt fit.

&gt; 2. Intake manifolds
&gt; 3. Fuel pump
&gt; 
&gt; I also think that I would either have to replace the fuel tank or at least modify it.  Is there anything that I have missed or overlooked?  If anyone has done this before, I would really appreciate some feedback on what was involved.
