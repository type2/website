Subject: Carburetor Adjustment
Message-ID: &lt;000f01bea4d5$f8710ba0$919f0e3f_at_oemcomputer&gt;

I just checked the archives &amp; they didn't appear to be working, so here
goes:

I need instruction on adjusting the carb on my engine.  It's a Solex
two-barrel progressive, the only identification I can find says H-34 SEIE.
It came on the (blown) 2l engine that was in the bus when I bought it.  I
have replaced that engine with a '73 (engine code CB).  It seems to be
running rich, which doesn't surpass me, since it's still adjusted for the
old, dead motor.  I can only find one adjusting screw with the carb
installed, it's on the front (hard to see in that cramped space) and is
spring-loaded.  I haven't fooled with it yet.

If anyone has knowledge of this carb, please let me know.  Yes, I know I
should be running the stock dual carbs.  I'm also running an 009
distributor.  The proper equipment will follow soon, but I want the bus
running now.  I put about 80 miles on the bus yesterday, the first time
outside my neighborhood with this engine, and found that I had plenty of
power.  I just want to make sure everything is as it should be.

TIA,
