Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic lifters - mistake to replace?

&gt; can check valve guides to see if they show signs of loosening up, and wear

you can see this in a hyd lifter engine too, have seen and noted it before
my rebuild.

&gt; Want more reasons?? The weakest part of the VW engine is the valve train,
&gt; not looking at it is a death wish!

who said anything about not &quot;Looking&quot; at it.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Great, glad to see that you are loving them, pop one out and look at
&gt; the heel of your camshaft one day when you want a reality check!

probably wouldn't know what I was looking at if I did, you build
thousands, I've built &quot;1&quot; engine...and had help at that

&gt; &gt; BTW, the same Devilish figure that introduced the hydraulic lifters,
&gt; &gt; probably played a key role in the camshaft choice for the stock engine...
&gt;
&gt; what's wrong with the camshaft choice,. these are workhorse vehicles not
&gt; show cars, at least that is how they were designed anyway
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is a heat generating, dirty running pig that kills the engine
&gt; in about every way possible.. It speaks volumes when a cam change can
&gt; increase the usable RPM band by 2,000 revs gain 15 BHP and drop engine temps

what would I do with 2,000 more RPM, don't max rev it now and with an auto
tranny it wouldn't know how to handle that many extra RPM.

&gt; by 50 degrees with no other changes made to a n otherwise bone stock

??? is that head temp or oil temp or some other measurement.  my oil temps
stay below 230F on all but the hottest days and then I slow down until the
engine cools down to what temp I want. generally can cruise at 55-60 in
95+ temps, hotter than that and I tend to stay home in the A/C..and where
I live only a fool drives faster than 65MPH max.

&gt; engine.. That's what we do and get excellent results from it!

I've heard nothing but good things about your engines.

&gt; I put a new cam in mine when rebuilt and it was stock
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Cool, until I started sharing my findings many people did the same
&gt; thing and had good luck, they did not know that a small change can make
&gt; tremendous differences in the entire engine.

cost/benefit,  do the benefits to me out weigh the costs, and that is a
case by case determination by the user.  the cost of valve adjustments in
my time and energy exceed the value gained IMO.  besides isn't a hyd
valves better than putting off adjusting a solid valve....which I
unfortuneatly would probably do because I hate the job so much.
