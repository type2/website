Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Bus starts but won't run!

When mine did that, the double relay was bad, but also check the big 
tubes going to the air sensor.

&gt; Hey everyone- came out of work Saturday morning and my 78 bus started
&gt; right up but then died.  Started it up again and the same thing
&gt; happened.  It is cranking fine, it just won't keep running unless I keep
&gt; my foot on the gas revving it, and it backfired a few times.  When I
&gt; turn the key to the accessories position I can not hear the fuel pump
&gt; running.  Does this mean bad fuel pump?  I am getting it towed Monday-
&gt; help!  Thanks, Beth and Prudence the 78 Bus.
