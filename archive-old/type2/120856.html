Subject: Re: [T2] turbo your heat.

&gt; &gt; Use the black ABS sewer pipe to replace the stock
&gt; &gt; pipe.. if its even still there. I had someone tell me
&gt; &gt; their buss heater didnt work at all and when I took
&gt; &gt; a look under the bus there was no tube! (I digress)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hello Guys     I dont use the abs pipe but instead use a exhust pipe for a 
&gt; big truck fits perfect and is metal which you can POR-15 to prevent rusting 
&gt; and 
&gt; weld into place. later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import Service

Hi Folks,

I had my pipe come loose in a snowstorm outside of Vegas, and it was a cold 
trip home.  Crawling underneath, I saw the pipe had rusted away.  I took the 
whole thing out and replaced it with standard 3&quot; insulated gas vent heater pipe. 
Then I wrapped that with fiberglas pipe insulation and then with hi-temp 
duct tape.  Made a big difference.

See you on the road,
Jerry
