  solution

Hiya Dan,

  I for one would LOVE to see some pics!! I'm in the same boat with my ' 79. 
Slider roof non-op and the area were the clips attach are rusted out. There is 
actually a place out here in so_dot_cal. that has the cable. But comes to several 
hundred dollars.

I have been thinking about attaching wheels to the door and putting a latch 
forward and back so I could keep it closed or all the way open. There is the 
problem of the weather strip though. Originally I was thinking about making it a 
pop-up but couldn't think of a way. I would assume there is lots of people 
would like to do something with a non-op sun roof. Besides just covering it with 
a piece of vinyl and taping it to the top!
 
I'll keep checking your site from time to time and see if you put up some 
pics.
Seeya.
