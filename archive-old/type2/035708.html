&gt;I was thinking about the exact same thing last week, although more for a

You will get very little noise reduction by treating the pop-top. The road
and engine noise far exceed the boundary layer noise coming thru the roof,
and until you treat that, I wouldn't worry about the pop-top. However, that
being said, you can reduce some of the noise reverberating in the cabin by
placing some open-celled foam on the pop-top.
