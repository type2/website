Subject: Re: [T2] Sachs VS Daikin clutch ?

[...]Don't know about the clutch.
--- I got four oil coolers laying about my shop, at
120 each think I'll hang on to them, they came off
busses and type 4's and they all look the same to me.
also have some older bus and t-4 flywheels and torque
converters, think they fit the 72-3 busses. If you
don't mind waiting I might be able to help with some
parts. Phil
