Darrin,
Sounds to me like your rear wheel bearings are knackered .In mine the hub
seems to have worn and so the bearing begins to turn wit the wheel. This
starts off as a chuff then a wscrape then a really bad creaking rumble.
It only makes this noise under load, so jacking it up is no use. This might
sound funny, but try adjusting your road position to alter ythe camber that
the wheels are at ( move closer to the kerb) If the noise decreases then
suspect the bearing. I had to drive a few miles in the gutter to make the
noise more bearable before I got to a a garage.
If i'm right and you replace the bearings make sure they are glued into
place. Otherwise before the year is out you'll be back to square one.
I also confused this problem with a transdmission one originally, because
the noise seemed worse on slowing down.

Hope this helps.

&gt;Hello All,
&gt;
&gt;Once again, I appeal to the experienced and knowledgable group for helpfull
&gt;advice.
&gt;
&gt;As I'm driving the '74 VW Westy at highway speed there is a low, but odd
&gt;groan coming from below (it sounds like it is coming from the back of the
&gt;bus).  Then, as I slow down, it gets even louder.  It is definitely related
&gt;to how fast I'm going and seems to get louder the slower I go.  Slowing
down
&gt;for a red light it sounds like something metal scraping everytime the wheel
&gt;goes around (very loud).  However, when I pull away from the traffic light,
&gt;it doesn't make a sound.  I've also tried driving slowly without having my
&gt;brakes on and it still makes this awfull noise.  Then, I jacked up the back
&gt;of the Bus (another question here) and spun the tire.   Not a sound.  When
I
&gt;jacked up both sides of the back of the Bus and spun the tire, it made a
&gt;slight noise, but not much at all.  What could be making this noise?  How
&gt;can I continue to troubleshoot the problem?
&gt;
&gt;I thought it may have been CV joints, since the CV Boots are toast.   Tried
&gt;to move them forward and back, but not much movement in there at all.  I
&gt;could grab the swing axle and turn the tire with hand strength.  Is there
&gt;much of a difference between VW made CV joints (have to order) and the ones
&gt;you can pick up at your friendly neighborhood parts store (in stock).
Also,
&gt;when you get new CV joints, what all is included?  Does it usually include
&gt;the thing you bolt on to the transaxle and the one you bolt on to the
wheel?
&gt;
&gt;I have a hydraulic floor jack and jack stands.  What do you usually use for
&gt;a lift point, and where do you normally put the jack stands.  Muir book
&gt;talked about jacks stands and lifting screwing up the usual VW Jack Lift
&gt;Points.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry about the wordy description and all the questions, but just trying to
&gt;learn and become one with my Bus without my wife killing me for having it
&gt;out of commission too long (Exhaust stud breakage put it out for two days).
&gt;
&gt;Thanks a lot,
&gt;
