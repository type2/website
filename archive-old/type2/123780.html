Subject: Was  No new Type II now I'm paying the price.

OK so I'll never rant again. Here's why:

I get home from work and decide HAL needs a real good bath, she's
filthy. The underside is covered with month old mud from a construction
site down the street that has spilled out into the street.

As I'm washing her down and spraying under the wheel wells my karma
catches up with me. I hear a popping noise and smoke starts bellowing
out from the right rear side of my bus. 

I see it two ways: One I toasted my hard start relay and my karma isn't
quite as bad as I thought or Two: I fried my less than month old starter
and I'm on a downward spiral I'll be lucky to get out of. Heck...I don't
even believe in karma. I guess I'll let things dry out and crawl under
to see how much trouble I'm in.

So I'll never whine again...sorry

Zach (Who has screwed up his bus repairing it lots, but never screwed it
up WASHING it before)
