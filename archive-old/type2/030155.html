Al,

But where is the point of disagreement?  You took the half-shafts off the
bus, you took the joints off the half-shaft, you installed the new boots,
you cleaned them, and you put new grease in them. Exactly what I would
have done!

I forgot to mention that you have to remove the joint from the half-shaft
anyway if you have a torn boot (which is true 75+% of the time).
