Subject: Re: [T2] replaced all hoses but one I cant find a replacement for.

I don't know if this will help much, but I just had the same problem. I replaced the hose with 3/4&quot; heater hose from autozone, i think that was the size. But after not to long the hose collapsed where it was bending causing no ventilation. After this I went to home depot and bought a gray plastic right angle hose connector around where they have all there tubing, 3/4&quot; also of course. I cut the heater hose and put it together and seems to be working just fine so far. It was about two months ago or so. Might be worth a try. Its better than the old cracked one 'til something better comes along.
