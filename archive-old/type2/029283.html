 Some Friday ramblings,
  A very interesting (IMO) Web site for travelling by auto in the USA is &quot;Road Trip USA&quot; (http://www.moon_dot_com/road_trip/).  Especially the RT 50 cross-country trip.

  Also, I have a sink and water holding tank from an old Coleman pop-up camper if anyone is interested.  Stainless steel sink measures 12&quot;x14&quot;x6(?)&quot;, has a 5 gal fresh water tank, and a mechanical pump/faucet.
