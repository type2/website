&gt; The gasket kit for my 34 PICT-3 is a multi use set for the 30 PICT-2, -3, and
&gt; the 34 PICT-3. The instructions state that the needle valve gasket thickness
&gt; is different for the various models as follows:
&gt;   a.. 30 PICT-2         1.0 MM
&gt;   b.. 30 PICT-3         1.5 MM
&gt;   c.. 34 PICT-3         0.5MM
&gt; The only gasket supplied in the kit however is 1.0 MM thick. Does this really
&gt; make enough difference that I should try to locate a 0.5 MM gasket? When I
&gt; took the carb apart, I noticed that there was no gasket used.

The only way to know for sure is to assemble the carb, secure it in a
level position, fill it with a funnel, take the top off, and measure the
level.  If it is too high, you need a thicker gasket.

The procedure is in the Bentley, IIRC.
