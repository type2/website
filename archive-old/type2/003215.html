Hi,

Over the past few weeks several Transporter owners located in central North
Carolina have expressed interest in forming a Type2 club. Many of those
folks are already NEATO members and would like to form another North
Carolina Chapter to represent the Piedmont region of the state. The club
will not be exclusive to pre 1968 buses but will incorporate NEATO into its
structure.

The club will have two main groups.One located in the Triad(Greensboro, High
Point, Winston-Salem) and the other in the Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel
Hill.)

Our Mission will be a simple one - preserve and operate old buses.

The two groups will gather monthly to break bread, have fellowship, etc

There will be quarterly meetings where the two groups meet and have more
fellowship. It has been proposed that the quarterly meetings be held as
picnics or cookouts (I like food so that works for me) This also allows us
to get together with the buses and the kids and have a good time without
adding to the already crowded camping schedule:)

However, an annual campout is a must!

Another grand idea is that of the &quot;maintenance day&quot; to promote preventative
and corrective maintenance. A vw shop owner who specializes in buses is
considering sponsoring the aspect of the club.

Share resources - tools, parts, knowledge, experience, etc

Dues- as of this time there are no plans to charge for membership in the
club.

(NEATO memberships are $20 a year and well worth more IMHO .)

If you live in North Carolina and wish to participate please e-mail me off
list.

For more about NEATO and the good work that it does go to David Easterwoods
page.
