&gt; Yes, I remember the discussion last year.  In that discussion, I wrote
&gt; about the experiment that I did by attaching a pointer to one of the
&gt; flap pivots so that I could visually check the position of the flap.
&gt; I discovered that at low outside air temperatures the flaps do indeed
&gt; modulate the flow of air.  On a freezing day, I stopped after running
&gt;

      I'd agree that in really cold weather, the flaps might not always be
fully open. But I see absolutely no difference in head temp from the hottest
day to the coldest day, once the engine is warmed up, with flaps in place
but no thermostat. What I do see is a major difference in oil temps, winter
and summer, but since (on the T4 engine anyway) when the flaps are closed,
more air goes to the oil cooler, I'd think that'd be the opposite of what
you want to get the oil temp up high enough to burn off water.
      There doesn't seem to be as much of a heat transfer from cyl &amp; head
temps to oil temps as what you'd expect, and, in fact, I wouldn't at all
mind seeing my oil temps run hotter in the really cold weather, but if
closing the flaps sends more air to the oil cooler, that would not be what
I'd want either.
