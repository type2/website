&lt;&lt; I'm not sure I understand what these folks did.

They need to have a better description of the test procedures and what 
they actually did to each piece of metal.

In the &quot;real&quot; scientific world this study would get an &quot;F&quot;.

Maybe I missed their test procedures here someplace...
 &gt;&gt;

Pretty sure I've seen this &quot;test&quot; before...They took a piece
of sheet metal and treated it to the particular product. Then
scratched an X into the surface and left it out for 500 hours.
Now whether they started with clean sheet metal or a rusted
piece... ?-(
