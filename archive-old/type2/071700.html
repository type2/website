I need to get a copy of 2 liter cases line bored.  The only shop in 
Utah that I know of that has the equipment is charging $145 each.

I noticed the ad in Hot VW's for the above and their price for a line 
bore of $30.  I am going to be in the LA area next week and am 
thinking of bringing my cases with me.

Does any one have any history with the above shop?

Thanks
