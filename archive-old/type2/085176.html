Subject: Re: [T2] Can't locate a part...  Paint question...

Hiya Jennifer,

I'm going to differ with Terry just this once.............

Yes, it is possible to repair plastic.  But if you have not had any 
experience with this process it can be a little tricky the first time out.  
And definitely DO NOT use JB Weld (a fine product otherwise) for this sort of 
job.  Brake fluid is very caustic and will undo this type of &quot;repair&quot;.  
Finally, even though this is not a pressure bearing member of your brake 
system, the entire brake system is not a place to experiment or try things 
for the first time.  You simply have too (way too) much riding on the overall 
effectiveness of your brakes.

So...........try this alternative instead.  If you cannot locate a brake 
fluid reservior in your area try one of the online boneyards.  Your best bet 
will always be Joe Mitchell over at BustedBus.  Find him at 
http://www.bustedvw_dot_com/newsite/index.html  Way Out Salvage in Kingston, 
Arkansas is a great place with which to do business.  You can find them 
online at http://www.wayoutsalvage_dot_com/   Or try Wilson at 
http://www.wilsonvw_dot_com/  Or try Averre's at http://www.averres_dot_com/  In 
short, do not be limited by your geography.  Your part is out there - go get 
it online.

Lastly, the code for Titian Red is L555.  Tell that to any painter and they 
will immediately understand what color you want.  Good luck!
