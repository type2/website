Subject: Front End (?) Noise

My 73 Westy pop top is making a noise. I think it is in the front end
because steering changes effect it. I become aware of it at around 35 mph.
It is a steady hum and is continuous. Gets louder as speed increases.
Doesn't matter if I shift or put in the clutch. Stops the second I start to
turn the wheel to the right (but not to the left), but begins again as soon
as I straighten the wheels. I noticed it first when I went from Tucson to
Lake Havasu for Busses By the Bridge. Probably happening at lower speeds and
I just can't hear it. Any ideas, O Wizards of Busaciousness?

TIA
