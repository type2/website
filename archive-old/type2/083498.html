Yup! you have hit the quartz crystal on the head!  When you hammer on
quartz, it reacts by generating a fairly hefty electrical charge.  If the
charge is lead along a wire, it can spark to a nearby ground.

&gt; I've taken it apart and there doesn't seem much to it!

Nope there sure isn't, is there? Hammer, crystal, wire, electrodes and
out.

&gt; Can I get a replacement?

At any place that sells propane barbeques or any  RV store, yes.  In the
US, almost every outdoor gas appliance with a built-in igniter has a piezo
ignitor.  Any can be adapted to work for you (with modification, of course
:-)

Before you get a replacement, tho...  the reasons that they stop working
are that the wire has separated from the crystal (1% of the time) or the
electrodes have gotten out of alignment/too far apart (99% of the time).
if you hold a grounded (with a jumper wire) screwdriver about 1-2mm from
the point of the contact and press the button, do you get a spark to the
screwdriver?  (do't do this to your finger, it *can* burn you!) If you get
a spark to the screwdriver, then the attachment is good, so look at the
spark gap end of things.  The piezo spark will jump about the same gap as
a spark plug, 1-2 mm.  It really helps if the tips of the electrodes are
(a) clean and shiny, nor carbon covered and (b) over the gas orifice.
Try cleaning and realigning the electrodes before popping for the new
igniter.
