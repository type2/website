OK article 1 is up, covers upgrading a busses suspension with sway bars, 
shocks and rear height adjustment
The URL is:

As a bonus I put up the VW shop manual supplement for Campers. I had it 
scanned and I think I sent it out to a few listees in the past. I also have 
the supplement for the BA6 (I own 2, both non-working :)) but I haven't 
scanned it yet and I think I'm missing some pages.
