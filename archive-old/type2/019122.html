&gt; O great and powerful list ---
&gt; 
&gt; Soon after installing KYB gas-adjust shocks all around
&gt; on my 74 Westy (nice not to have to consult the
&gt; turn-and-bank indicator when rounding an easy curve),
&gt; I noticed a noise, best described as a &quot;snick&quot; or
&gt; metallic &quot;click&quot;, coming from the general area under
&gt; the driver's seat each time I hit an irregularity in
&gt; the road.  The shocks that came with the loaf were
&gt; worn and really spongy; stiffening the ride has prob.
&gt; overly stressed another part of the suspension.  Sound
&gt; familiar to anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I assume that if I can grab the tie rod section
&gt; that connects to the right front spindle, and twist it
&gt; back and forth on its joints with almost no
&gt; resistance, that it's 'bout time to fix it?  TIA.

Bill:
It might be a loose shock, particularly if the noise is &quot;new&quot;. 
The tie rod SHOULD twist somewhat freely as both tie rod ends are
spherical. It should not have perceptable lateral movement. This is
where a good front end alignment shop comes in handy. I just take it to
them, they tell me what to fix, I bring it back and they align it!
They make the easy money, I do the hard work. They seem happy with this
arrangement. They aren't too keen on chasing parts for furrin cars
anyhow!
