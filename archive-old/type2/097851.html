&lt;&lt; Just for a hoot I tore up a Winchester Hard drive and removed the
magnets, these are very strong magnets riveted to a steel plate and fit
the Type IV strainer plate surface to a T. They are so strong that they
adhere through extreme rainwater splashes and 65/75 mph speeds without
moving a fraction on the strainer plate. &gt;&gt;

Curb-shopping or Dumpster-diving is another source of strong magnets.
Most speaker cabinets by the side of the road suffer death by rotted
bass foam surround but still have viable magnets...My engine sports
an AR 3a magnet...
