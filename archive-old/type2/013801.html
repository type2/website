BS.  Particularly on the intake it isn't going to ever &quot;see fuel&quot; in any
concentrated form.  You all do what you will, I've used Dirko on GAS
TANK grommets on Vanagons and seen it still just fine 5 years later
when I pulled the tank.

Again I'm not talking about gooping crap on so that it sqeezes into
the runners, I'm talking a thin layer compressed on the gasket that
will never be touched by fuel, air, or anything else till the day someone
removes the runner.

YMMV.
