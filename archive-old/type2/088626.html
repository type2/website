Subject: Re: bleeder valves

Melissa,

I have not broken a single bleeder nipple since using liquid wrench AND
hammering straight down on the nipple to vibrate the threads loose. Don't
hammer to hard or you will obviously do some damage - just light taps with a
small hammer or even a heavy wrench. Hammer the nipple straight 'into' it's
hole - as though you are driving a nail - but just tap. Alternate between
sqirting on liquid wrench and tapping and then trying to loosen. Repeat many
many times if need be. Also let the liquid wrench soak in for a while - even
overnight.

I live in the rust belt so this is always a problem. But this method has
worked for me every time!

&gt;I tried unsuccessfully yesterday to open my rear bleeder valves on my 71
&gt;before I switched out the hoses. I squirted them down with some rust
&gt;penetrator ahead of time let them sit a few hours and still couldn't get
them
&gt;open. I gave up trying to apply too much pressure for fear of stripping
them.
&gt;Any ideas what I could do to get these little buggers off? Would a light
&gt;torch help? I dont want to replace the back lines just to find out I cant
&gt;bleed them and will be screwed.
