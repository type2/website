Subject: Disable parking light

Does anyone have a way to disable the parking light.  I checked the wiring
diagram, I cut the brown wire to the tail light but that disabled the tail
light in the on position also.   soldered it back together with shrink tube
so no damage done, but still the potential to run the automatic battery
drainer through turning the fork lock too far. Have checked the archives,
but no luck

Thanks

David Mueller
