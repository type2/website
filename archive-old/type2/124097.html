Subject: starter

Does anyone know a source for a NEW Bosch starter for a 77 with AUTOMATIC
transmission. I have found them for a manual transmission, but not automatic.
I have been through too many remanufactured and off brand starters to consider
less than new. I did find HiTorque starters, but they list at $200 or so plus
shipping.

This is my daily driver, need it in a hurry!
