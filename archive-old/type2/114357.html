Subject: Weber 34 ICTs on 73 Bus,

Hi, I've been browsing through the archives and I have seen TONNES of 
postings regarding the Dual weber 34ICT carbs on various Buses. Every 
posting seems to point out more and more things I am going to have to 
think about to slap these new carbs on my bus !

I am interested in hearing some experiences and advice, as I know there 
are all kinds of jet/idle opinions floating around and I want to be as 
on top of it as I can when I do the install (I dont want to be caught 
missing anything !) I'm currently running a stock 1700, 1973 with Dual 
Solex carbs, any comments on what I will notice MPG and 
performance'wise ?

I got the kit from mofoco_dot_com and from talking to the guys there it 
seems to be a fairly complete kit (Carburators, manifolds, gaskets, 
linkage, air cleaner and instructions). However I am sure there are 
OTHER things I am missing which will directly effect the change to the 
new carbs.

Any and all thoughts would be much appreciated,
Steve
