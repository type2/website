Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Popped valve seat picture

When I rebuilt I followed the Tech Service Bulletin (TSB) in regards to notching the con rods and eliminating the head gasket in favour of barrel shims.  The Ps and Cs were all new.  I gapped the rings. I cc'd the heads and put in the required shims only to achieve stock compression (don't recall the details off the top of my head).  I will be going through the above routine again before re-assembly.
I use a Dakota CHT on #3.  I use a vac gauge, and when tuning, the Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) is right on my laptop.  I never could get higher than 12 or 13&quot; at idle. I assume the cam had something to do with that.

More controversy:  I plan on using the existing Webcam lifters with 3K miles on them with the NEW Webcam stock camshaft.  Any problem with that? Surely there is imperceptible(?) wear on the face of the lifters to screw up that interface.  I recall the cam to lifter run-in procedure at start up and will repeat that.

Very interesting comments from Jamie on his experience with another mystery overheater...

You may be on to something. The AVP website says the following about their type 4 engines:
&quot;Then all heads are step cut to take the unleaded, lower quality fuel of  today.&quot;
&gt;  
My opinion is that the AVP folks run the compression on their engines waaaay down so as to keep the head temps down....and longetivity up!
