Subject: More MSHP data with pictures (Was RE: MSHP heads)

Thanks for all of the replies about MSHP and the cylinder heads.  I should
add that I visited their shop and found them to be agreeable people, and
fairly knowledgeable.  They were happy to discuss all sorts of engine
issues with me even though I was only making a $350 purchase.  However,

I took my just-rebuilt-by-MSHP heads apart tonight and was not happy with
what I found.  I put some pictures up on the web so you can all share in my
aggravation.  :)

You be the judge.  Would you run these heads on your engine?  All I can say
in my defense was that they had paper towels stuffed in the ports when I
bought them and I didn't pull all eight of them and look closely.  Next
time I will not make that mistake.

-David
