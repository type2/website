Subject: RE: [T2] Rust Under the Windshield

&gt; My bus had very bad rust under the windshield when I got it, 
&gt; and there was little to no rust inside the nose.  I think the 
&gt; water can drain out the bottom, so it does not pool up inside.


This is a very common problem with busses. On many, the windshield seal
is ancient and is allowing lots of rain water to collect under the seal,
where it sits there and rusts away your lower windshield lip. If you see
some rust below the windshield seal, it's a safe bet than underneath
that seal there is lots more of it.  Water will generally drip behind
the dash during rain. This may cause an electrical short if the wiring
in your dash gets wet. 

It's a pain to fix properly, but it won't get any better. It's better to
nip it in the bud than to wait until you have a major rust problem
and/or electrical problem on your hands.

We do sell a reasonably priced repair kit made by AH Schofield in
England that replaces the metal under the windshield. This will have to
be welded in. It comes in three pieces, and between the three of them,
replaces your entire lower windshield lip plus a few inches below it (in
other words, the area that commonly rusts). Of course the other option
is to use filler, but of course this is not as complete a repair as
welding new metal and may be riskier. However if you are lucky enough to
catch the rust before it is too bad this may be an viable option.

I'd also recommend that you use POR-15 rust preventative on any areas
where the rust has not been 100% eliminated.  Used according to
directions (which is key), it really can stop rust in its tracks. This
is not the same product as the &quot;Extend&quot; that is sold in auto parts
stores. This one works, and is commonly used by professional restorers.
I have used it on several vehicles and saw no trace of the rust
returning years later. There are plenty of testimonials in the list
archives from other Bus owners who have had the same results.

Of course you'll also need a new windshield seal. After all, it's
probably the condition of your original one that allowed the water in to
begin with and caused the rust!  Our genuine VW windshield seal (from
VW/Brazil) has a just slightly taller profile than the German one; in
other words it extends just slightly lower onto the body than the
original one. This can be helpful in that if there are minor cosmetic
artifacts after you finish your rust repair, it may conceal them. This
is the same seal VW uses on Brazilian made busses and it fits. It is NOT
the same as the aftermarket Mexican/Brazilian windshield seals that
other vendors sell for about the same price.

We also sell a little plastic windshield installation tool that, while
not absolutely necessary, can aid in coaxing the seal into the correct
spot.

A couple of hints on reinstalling the windshield. First, leave the seal
out in the sun for a few hours prior to installation to make it more
pliable and easier to install. Secondly, because of its size it is
fairly easy to crack a bus windshield on reinstallation. The good news
is that if you shop around, a brand new windshield can commonly be had
for just over $100 including installation (from such chains as Safelite
Auto Glass). Even if you use your old windshield, you may want to get a
quote from the glass place for installation, particularly if they will
take responsibility if they crack it putting it back in. On the other
hand, if your windshield is looking old, for about $120 installed this
might be an opportune time to replace it while it's out.
