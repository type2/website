Subject: Re: [T2] vw mechanic's rates

All depends on what the local shop rates are--

If your labor rate was halfof what VW got--you would have so much work
you wouldn't know what to do with it all--

I usually am 5 dollars less per labor hour on Semi's--than the dealer
is--
Everybodies happy--

Hey. I'm starting a little side business fixing cars on my college
campus. There's a lot of VWs here, and so far those are the only cars
i've gotten calls about. One guy has a '64 bus that he says needs a new
carburetor.
        I know a lot of people on the list do work for
other people, and i was wondering what everyone charges for labor. I
have a degree in Auto Mechanics, and I've always fixed my own buses. I
just need a little help with rates.
Anyone have any advice?
thanks.
