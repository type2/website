&gt;Will Vanagon shocks work on a mid-late Bay??

I don't think so. The Vanagon suspension changed dramatically in 1980.

Most Koni resellers that cater to VW don't have part numbers for the front because Koni hasn't sold that shock absorber for a while now.

The rears Konis are still available in small quantities. A couple of weeks ago, Koni told me that they had 35 left in their warehouse in Holland. After that, no more will be supplied to resellers. How many the resellers still have varies obviously but from calling everyone I found on google so far, they all seemed to have to special order them from Koni.

For those still wondering what all the hype it about, they are adjustable oil filled premium shocks. They are also rebuildable so if you have the receipt and a worn out shock you can send them to Koni.

Depending on what catalog you look at you'll eventually find these numbers:

56-67 Microbus (80-1349 Front, 80-1350 Rear)

68-69 Type II (80-1966 Front, 80-1967 Rear)
70-71 Type II (80-2110 Front, 80-1967 Rear) 
72-79 Type II (80-2110 Front, 80-2220 Rear)

80-91 Vanagon (80-2100 Front, 80-2101 Rear)
93-04 Eurovan (82-2379 Front, 82-2380 Rear)

The Koni engineers saw fit to choose specific damping profiles for 68-79 models whereas VW only provided a 68-69 and 70-79 front shock and a single 68-79 rear shock (ignoring HD versions poorly documented in the microfiche).
