Subject: Poor mans AC idea.

     I am very ignorant in respect to most things electrical.  I have this 
idea for a poor mans AC unit to knock the edge off the heat on the high temp 
days in my bus.  I got the idea from looking at the swampy coolers 
(www.swampy_dot_net) and thought I could make a less efficient but cheaper 
version of the ice chest model on my own.  I like this kind of cooler 
because it can be run anytime (with vehicle on or off, moving or not), and 
it's portable.  My main question is how much is this thing going to drain 
the battery?  Also, Any tricks or tips that might help?  Any general design 
improvements?  Am I completely insane for wanting to try this?  Anybody else 
done anything like this?
     Take a medium-small sized heavily insulated cooler (6 or 12 pack 
size?), possibly one of the new ones that have a DC powered cooling plate?  
Install a cheap 6-8 pass transmission/oil/or motorcycle radiator block style 
cooler on the lid.  Mount one or two 12V high output computer case fans (or 
DC car fans of some sort) either right on the radiator, or at one end of a 
custom housing to force the air through the radiator.  Run vinyl or silicone 
tubing from the radiator through holes in the lid (sealed around edges with 
expanda-foam), one for intake, one for return.  buy a cheap aquarium or 
marine bilge pump that runs on 12V DC and use that to circulate the cold 
water through the radiator. Preferably splice the two or three 12V DC wires 
together into one cig lighter adapter so you only have one plug, alternately 
buy a three into one cig lighter accessory splitter to plug them all up.  
Place unit between the front seats (I have a walk-through) and ride cool 
(er)!

So what do we think?  Please don't laugh!
Jay Ollom
