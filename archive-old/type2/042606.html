Subject: New Bus Owner and Turn Signal Question

Hello!

Yesterday I picked up my first bus. It's not something that most of you would write home about, but it's my bus :) ... I set out with a very limited budget to find a camper, and I got one but the body needs a little work, as well as my turn signals do not work.

I was hoping that you guys/gals could help me get them going. Here's what happens: Hazard lights blink very, very rapidly...I can hear the relay chattering at me, when they blink...most of the time they are just lit solid. (relay problem?) ... Now, when they are on, the turn signal indicators in the spedo are flashing the same. Ok...when I turn my turn signal on, nothing. No indicator, no turn signal lights, nothing...nor does my dimmer switch work (dimmer relay? -- took switch apart, manually made contact and still no bright lights).

I am handy at elecronics so I downloaded a wiring diagram for my bus from vintagebus_dot_com however I do not understand how the switch works --- until I can afford a new $100 piece of work I was going to wire up a spare $1 dpdt switch for my turn signals but I can't figure out how the blinker get's activated with the switch (so far, I have looked only at the wiring diagrams, I have not researched the actual wiring of the switch yet)... Anyways, I have searched type2_dot_com, archives, etc with no luck.

Oh yeah, it's a 1971 westy. Engine and tranny and the interior are great, but around the bottom of the front window there are a few rust throughs, the real window seal needs replaced, along the bottom of the front fender needs a little help, and the mid part of the drivers side needs a little help.

Anyways, if anyone can help me figure out what's going on with my electrics, I would greatly appriciate it! I would like to do more than the trip home and maybe go on a few trips away from home in it, but gotta get the turn signals working first :-)

Thank you,

P.S. some pictures will be available on the web in a few days if anyone cares to see my bus.
