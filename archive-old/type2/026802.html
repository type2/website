Hello again list,

    Well after my last post about having no brake lights I did some more 
digging and have some more questions. I replaced every bulb on the bus. I 
found a 70 owners manual on the web and used the bulbs according to it. They 
seem to work fine but i have a few minor issues detailed below.

Head Lights - High Beams only? At least that is what I must pull the switch 
to in order for them to come on.

Front Running Lights - Working A-OK . Found some bad connectors attached to 
the running lights replaced and all worked ok.

Reverse Lights - Not working at all. Replaced bulbs. The 70 owners manual 
say's there is a fuse in the engine compartment mounted above the coil. My 
question is should it be in that location in a 71? If not where should I 
look for it?

Back Left side - Works as running light but not for turn signal.

Back Left - Running and turn signal A-OK.

Back Right Side - Worked for a while as a running light but very dim. Now 
does not work as a running light but does work as a turn signal.

Back Right - same as above.

I have no emergency flashers either.

If anyone has any input on what I could do to trouble shoot these issues 
further I would be so thankful. Also if anyone could tell me the correct 
types of fuses to use and which go where in the 12 port fuse box. Ie. port 1 
8 port 2 8 port 3 -16 ect.. How hard would it be to re wire the buse to 
factory spec? Does anyone know of a vendor that sells a rewiring kit for the 
type 2 bus?

Thanks for your help,

Joe
