Subject: Re: [T2] Re: VWoA still being VWoA

  The next logical step is for them to go after rogue film developers like
Costco and Walgreen and order them to cease and desist the printing of
illegal likenesses of people standing beside their bus without VWOA's 
permission.
This lawless disregard for VWOA's control of their products images must 
stop!!!
Costco and Walgreen are just as guilty as the outlaws who actually have the 
nerve 
to take these illegal images of VWOA's sacred products..............
