Subject: Re: [T2] &amp;*%^$#$$  Heater Boxes, U-Pipes and exhaust leaks.

 Follow-up.  My T2 is a 78 Federal 2.0 Liter.  I don't
find the `down pipes` available anywhere.  They have
been referred-to as the `J Tubes.`  Have not looked
extensively.  Adam Cox took his 78 T2 to a mechanic
some months ago, and the mechanic stated there was
still a supplier for this item.

Where?  Part Number?

J pipes are usually in reference to replacement pipes for type 1 heater boxes. Since type 1 heater boxes bolt
to the front of the head exhaust port, the pipe is shaped like a J.

Type 4 engines are a different style.  Not sure what you mean by 'down pipes, unless you are referring to the
75-78 exhaust manifolds?

Are these what you want? They are in left and right flavors. The manifolds are made of stainless steel, the
flanges on all ends are iron. The heat shields on them are tin.
