Subject: Re: [T2] What is the weight of a camper?

&gt;As you've been reading, there have been mixed replies to my idea of towing. So, to decide, I need to know, what is the weight of a VW Camper High Top? Anyone have a guess?

You can put me firmly in the &quot;against&quot; camp.  I don't care if the camper weighs 2500 or 4500lbs, I still wouldn't do it.  But since you asked, my highroof camper weighs in at about 3,600lbs with no people in it.  I wouldn't tow it with anything less than a full-sized truck weighing at least 5,000 lbs and having brakes and tires to match.
