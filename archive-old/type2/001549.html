many new car manufacturers are recommending 0-20 for their new models (fuel
efficiency, and reduded emmisions).

I have found Quaker State 5-50 FULL synthetic to drop oil temps 10-15
degrees with no change in head temps (or a slight drop).

Outstanding oil (and I used to HATE quaker state oil).

the full synthetic is difficult to find, but we have it if you don't want to
search.
