&gt; Now I find myself traveling from sunny Florida to cool Boston.  Since the temperatures are declining I decided it was time to reconnect the heat.  I've successfully reconnected the heat, but is smells like the engine compartment and I worry somewhat about suffocating.

&gt; There is where my plea for help comes in.  I think the next step would be to reconnect some of the emissions equipment.

If the heat exchangers and heating system in general has not been used for so long, I think you are beginning to burn off years of accumulated stuff.  I don't think restoring your emissions controls will solve the odor problem.  First, try to clean out the heating system then check for and seal any leak points.  Since the inlet air for the heater is inside the engine compartment, any
oil leaks or fuel leaks, or exhaust leaks (if the engine seal is not intact) may find their way into the inlet.
