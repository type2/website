Subject: Re: [T2] CV joints nocking sound

Same exact thing happened to me. The CVJ by the gear box had a broken outer 
race.
Press would be nice, but, I just did it by hand. It'll be nice to have a 
socket like thing to fit over the axle when reinstalling past the circlip groove. 
Watch the splines!
