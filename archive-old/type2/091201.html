Subject: Re: [T2] Just a Couple of Questions

I just installed a toggle switch under the dash. When
the engine is stopped and I want to listen to tunes, I
switch it over to the constant 12v supply and then
back to the ignition for normal driving.

&gt; There are several circuits that are live on the fuse
&gt; panel. The lights are 
&gt; a good example.
