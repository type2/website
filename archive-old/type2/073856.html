There you go with assumptions again. I don't assume anything except I
assume many reading these posts don't know some of the simple stuff and
need some details to understand the issues. The Bentley is designed for
practicing mechanics, journeyman types, so I try to fill in some of the
blanks Bentley ASSUMES is understood by the reader. I made no assumption
about your particular level of knowledge, but provided info that might be
helpful to the novices among us looking for rudimentary understanding of
things quite apparent to those with more experience.
