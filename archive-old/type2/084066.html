Subject: Is there an alternative to a BN4?

Volks,
The idea of a supplemental heat source, particularly one that can be
used while in camp, is extremely attractive to me. Is there another
option, besides the BN4, that has been used and found to be effective,
reasonable priced, safe, and otherwise worth considering. Perhaps one
that burns propane?

Cheers,
Chris
