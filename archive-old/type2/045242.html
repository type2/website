Subject: Re: [T2] Problem with dual 34's

Dual 34s...  One bbl per cylinder, right?  Intake pulses are spaced so far
apart that the synchronizing device (not a Uni-Syn, I assume) has time to
return to zero between intake pulses.  A Uni-syn can be (sorta) damped to
compensate for this, but a mercury manometer will do a much better job. 
You'll need to drill and tap the intake manifolds for vacuum fittings though. 
You can get the manometer through your local (or on-line) motorcycle supply.
