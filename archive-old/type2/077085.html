&gt; rebuilt type2 1975 1.8L
&gt; 
&gt; here's the problem: got everything together and it ran quite well but had no guts so i checked and compression was 80 all the way around... rebuilt heads, new mahle p&amp;c's... hmmm...
&gt; 
&gt; the only thing i can guess is that my cam is wrong (it was meshed with the crankshaft just fine), put the wrong size shims under the cylinders, or gaskets btwn cylinders and heads, or my valves aren't making a good seal... but to start i thought i should make sure the cam is correct:
&gt; 
&gt; here's the number for the cam:
&gt; 021-109-11-b-19H -3
&gt; 
&gt; that's on the gear... on the shaft itself i find, in between the lobes, from the gear back:
&gt; F7
&gt; C1
&gt; CWC
&gt; 
&gt; does this mean anything to anyone? incidentally, my machinist ordered me regular bearings and such and said that nothing needed to be oversized or reground or anything when i got the stuff back...
&gt; 
&gt; any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks!
