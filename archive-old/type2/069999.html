Hey all,

Has anyone seen the movie &quot;Making an American Quilt&quot; and ID'd the
splittie 
that the boy friend drives?

- -------------

I just rented it this afternoon and watched it. A real tear-jerker for
me. The splittie appeared to be a 1966 or 67  13 window deluxe based on
the fact that it had the grab handles for the front doors under the
sliding windows. It had a sunroof but wasn't a full-size Golde, possibly
an aftermarket? Nice bus though and was seen 4 or so times including
both at the beginning and end of the movie. Recommended date movie..
