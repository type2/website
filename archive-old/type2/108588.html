Subject: Re: [T2] Hendrix - Bus Video

From: &lt;tjaspers_at_ameripath_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I taped the Jimmy Hendrix video for someone...

The local VW club meets on the first Friday of every month (which is
actually a regular city holiday called &quot;First Friday&quot;), and while we missed
last month's meeting, it was on the news.

I was surprised to find that one of the club members has a bus that was used
by the Dead on their road trips.  They posted the video from the news
coverage at the website, http://www.csravwclub_dot_org/.
