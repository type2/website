&gt; &gt; Hey George, care to comment on the physics of a fuel pump trying to keep
&gt; &gt; over 40 psi while working against a fuel tank or filter blockage?  Also,
&gt; &gt; using a Bosch Ford 250 truck (89) pump designed for a 4 liter engine?

Even if the input was a near vacuum, it shouldn't reduce the output
pressure by more than 15PSI until the fuel vaporizes.  Since most pumps
are probably a bit
overdesigned the likely result of a blockage is vaporization of the gas
upstream of the pump if the blockage is itself upstream of the pump.  If
the blockage is downstream of the pump there is probably an internal
bypass to prevent pump damage.
