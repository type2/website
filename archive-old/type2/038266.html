Subject: Re: Tranny Removal

happy friday to all
wile we're on tranny's I'm putting a 2liter in a 1970 transporter
and I would like to know if the mounts are the same on an early 70 bus and a 
later the 76 tranny.
 this would be a lot easyer then looking for a new fly wheel and and cluch 
pilot shaft adaptor.
 and the later tranny would be nice on the hiways
 thanks for all the good advice that i have received from al of you
