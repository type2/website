you will find a claw hammer (not the real sharp bend, the gradual one) is
perfect for getting the bail onto the cover, then you finish the job with
the screwdriver.

&gt;   Today i decided to change the valve cover gaskets on my '80 vanagon,
&gt; and
&gt; came across quite a predicament. it seems
&gt; impossible to get the clip back over the covers. on an older baywindow
&gt; it is easy because the heat exchangers are not in the way. but it is
&gt; defintley too hard to do it with your fingers, and there is no room to
&gt; pry it up there with a screw driver. anyone else ever faced this
&gt; problem?
