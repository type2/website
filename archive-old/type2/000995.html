Before I break the ice box on my '72 in an attempt to make it better.....

What type of insulation is used?
How wide is it or how much room is there to put better insulation in?
How do get at the insulation?  Just bend the crimped metal out of the way?

Any successful techniques of improving the insulation -- the archives did
not reveal any to me.
