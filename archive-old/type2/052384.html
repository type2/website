Subject: [T2] 1972 engine problems

Can anyone recommend a good garage or mechanic in the South west of 
England? The 1600cc engine in my 1972 bus ceased after the oil 
drained out and wasn't topped up whilst my partner took it on a 'long 
run' last summer

Over the winter I have managed to free the engine but now it sounds 
like a bag of spanners and is very, very low on power - I have 
trouble moving it across my gravelled car park and up a curb.

I have no real technical knowledge of vans or engines and have just 
heard horror storys about the local camper van 'specailist'.

Should I attempt to fix it or look for another engine?

Does anyone want to sell me a 1600cc engine - cheap?
