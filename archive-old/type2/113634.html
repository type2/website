Subject: Re: [T2] Muir engine sounds url?

&gt;I just gave Joe a call and he said that he abandoned the web site a while
&gt;ago with the material not being picked up anywhere.  I did a search for the
&gt;sounds using  MUIR and &quot;engine sounds&quot;   and the only hits were links to
&gt;Joe's site.   So... It looks like they are gone, gone, gone.

I've got the sound files archived but dunno what the copyright restrictions 
might be. I'm willing to share but don't want to run afoul of anybody...
