&lt;&lt; next i went out to home depot or lowes either one and bought the big 
sheets of insulation board that are as big as sheets of plywood cant remember the 
name of it maybe some of the lists carpenters will rememeber the name of this 
specific insulation board?

anyways i cut the board and lay it over the gooy roof patch and then i was 
able to crawl around on the top of the board...
 &gt;&gt;

It might be a little late to ask now, but are you sure that the wet/dry 
patching 
compound (petroleum based) is compatable with the (styro)foam board insul-
ation...? Even when installing foam board in a house requires a quick read on
the adhesive label to be sure it doesn't eventually dissolve the foam...
