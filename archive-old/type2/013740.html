&gt;&gt; part=231 068 151(roof bracket, up to no. 2561) also 231 068 152(roof
&gt;&gt; bracket). Does anyone have any available? Or is there another way of
&gt;&gt; attaching it to my gutter? I'd love to hear any idea's you might have
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I use a couple pieces of rebar (cut to about 3 feet each for easy storage)
&gt;and a couple clamps.  I place the vestibule over the gutter, then place the
&gt;rebar over the vestibule in the gutter.  I secure it with I couple of spring
&gt;clamps.  I also use a couple of magnets to hold things in place.

I'm not sure what this all means as mine has the rubber that attaches
but a real COOL tip I used to use to attach a tarp awning is to cut a
piece of heavy wall 1&quot; PVC pipe into 2-3 3 foot sections then carefully
slit the pipes end to end on a table saw with about a 1/8&quot; kerf blade.
The forms a 3' long C shaped thing as you look at the end of it.
Then you put the awning or vestibule I guess over the gutter and slide
the cut PVC pipes over and voila, rustproof nonmarring attachment.
You could use a bunch or just a couble of short bits of pipe depending
how much you want to attach, I wanted to attach the full length of 10'
tarp to a vanagon rain gutter so 3 3' pieces were wonderful.  If you
are clamping something thinner use a thinner kerf blade (like a small
one for one of those little super cordless hand saws) but the pipe will
close up after it is cut anyway.  That heavy black ABS stuff for cold
water may be better (thicker) but it comes in rolls and doesn't straighten
out too well.  The pipes tucked under the back seat.
