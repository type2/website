Subject: Re: [T2] Points 'wore' out


You should apply a small dab of dieletric (SP?) grease to the distributor
shaft to lubricate this part or the point s and prevent just such a problem
from occuring. This grease comes with some high quality sparkplug wire sets
and should also be applied to the ends of plug wires to prevent moisture
and corosion problems there. You can buy a small tube of this stuff at your
FLAPS. It really helps especially if you live a wet or often damp area.

Hi.

The rubbing 'leg' on my ignition points 'wore' down in just a few thousand
miles and in just a few months.  They were installed in June 2001 on a '78
Westy FI 2.0l by yours truly, and have about 6K miles on them.

But the closing of the points was within a single month, and less than 1K
miles.  During this single month period, I read the points at 50, then 60,
then 70+ and then the Westy became unreliable.  Chug-a, chug-a.  I could
not
see ANY gap on them.

My previous two sets of points show NO perceptible wear on the fiber leg; I

still have them (one set at 40K miles, next set at more than 12K miles. All

three sets of points have the brown fiber 'leg'.  My new points are
Brazilian and have a white fiber 'leg')

I replaced the points and set my new Brazilian points at 46.5 degrees and
noticed my timing was 4 degrees off.  Close enough...

I ran the '78 Westy for a week, trying to read up on how to do the timing,
when I took new readings.

The dwell went to a solid 50 degrees and the timing went to within  a half
degree of specs. (specs = the red dot on the timing gauge)

What caused the 'leg' to wear?  It looked like it was ripped flat with
ragged edges.  Was it faulty??    Am I faulty???  Or was it 'their'
fault????
