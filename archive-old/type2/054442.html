Subject: part 3 of extremely high oil pressure

volks- this is in response to many of the questions and postings
regarding my posting.  My gauge is and sender are electric and both are
VDO. I opened the packages that they came in about one hour before I
installed them. The sender does NOT have two terminals (just seemed too
expensive to me), it only has one.  I have an 1800 pancake, and my
external oil cooler is piped in where the oil filter used to be. It's a
nifty attachment that screws right in like the oil filter did, but has
two nipples coming out of if, one for the flow out and one for the flow
in. The hoses go to my filter and second oil cooler (I didn't remove the
stock oil cooler).  My oil is 10w 30, 4 quarts of synthetic and (because
I didn't have any more syn) one quart of non-syn. Thanks to Muir, I found
the location of the oil pressure valve (between the pushrods of #1
cylinder), and I will check that tomorrow. My pressure regulator valve
seemed fine, but I had to stick a magnet up in the hole to get the
plunger thingy out. It came out without any problem.  Thanks for all of
the help. I will keep you all posted.
