Subject: Re: [T2] Wing window latch removal

I just switched the whole window out
much easier than taking out the handle.

[...]

&gt; Is there any special trick or tool needed to remove the latch on the wing
&gt; window? I need to take the one off of my &quot;old&quot; bus, as the  driver's side
wing
&gt; window latch on my &quot;new &quot; bus is missing the black knob that you grip.
