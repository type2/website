Subject: Re: [T2] window rubber

Hi Joel,

I have heard some people advise to use tar under the windshield seal. This
is supposed to be able to stop water from getting under the seal and unlike
silicone it will remain pliable under varied weather conditions. Whenever
the weather gets warm the tar melts and thus maintains a nice thin layer
between the seal and metal.

I don't know if this is just an old wives tale, but the idea made sense to
me so I used some when I installed my windshield last  spring. So far I have
had no leaks. It added $5 to the cost of the install and took about 5 extra
minutes to clean up afterward.

Then again, the cracked windshield it replaced didn't leak either; and there
was no tar under it.

Happy trails,

&gt; 
&gt; no. it should fit nice &amp; tight without any sealant.
&gt; 
&gt; use the string/wire in the groove trick with a little
&gt; soap (some people object to this idea). baby
&gt; powder will work also.
&gt; 
&gt; good luck.
