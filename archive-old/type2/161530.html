Subject: 2 Hopefully easy questions

Howdy,

I was lucky enough to finally get a stand alone tent that attaches to my 
van. The one that came as an accesory I guess for early bay window vans. 
Blue top, yellow body and full grey bottom.

Since I'm used to going camping in a regular camping tent, I've always put 
down a ground cloth (plastic) and set the tent on top of that. My question 
is should I do the same for the westfalia tent?

Also I was lucky enough to pick up a set of for lack of a better way to 
describe them (ambulance fans) for my bay window. Such as the ones pictured 
here:

Looking at the picture on the ad I would assume that the fans blow the wind 
towards you looking at the face of the fans. But in fact mine blow them out 
the back where the winding is (towards the top if your looking at the 
picture). I've looked at my Bently wiring diagram and have the wires in the 
correct place.

I guess I just need to know what way the fans should be blowing looking at 
the picture (up or down)?

Thanks
Kevin
