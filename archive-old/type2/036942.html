Subject: Re: portable heaters?

I tried to use a cheap one of these heaters during a trip from Seattle to
California during Christmas.  I made it about 50 miles out before the
cigarette lighter had a melt down.  It melted part of the dash, some of the
wiring, and the plug for the heater.
If you decide to use one anyway, make sure your cigarette lighter is wired
with a heavy gauge wire and don't skimp on the heater.

&gt; &gt; Anyone know of any decent heaters that plug into the cigarette lighter?
