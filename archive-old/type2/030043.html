Jim,

I think this would be an excellent modification from a safety standpoint!
And I do not think it would be too difficult to accomplish from a plumbing
standpoint.  At the same time, I have this gut feeling that getting it to
work correctly would definitely be non-trivial. 

To keep things simple, consider a '68-70 bus wwith drum brakes.  *Most* of
the braking on any car is done by the front wheels, even on a drum brake
vehicle.  I have heard 60-80% numbers, don't know what the real figure is.  
Say you rigged it so that you just had one circuit doing front left/rear
right and the other doing front right/rear.  OK while it is all working,
but if you lose a circuit (the rear right flex hose gets cut and blows
wide open) and the other takes on 100% of the braking (the front
right/rear left circuit in this instance) then you will have 60-80% of
your brake force on the front right corner of the bus.  More specifically,
you will have 60-80% of the brakes on the right side of your bus.  The bus
would pull you right off the road the first time you applied the brakes.
And it would be worse in a later bus, with discs.

Now they added a proportioner in the disc brake years to even out the
pressure differential required by disc vs. drum brakes, and I imagine
something like this is done in dual diagonal systems, but I think it is
more than just running new pipes.  If anyone (Karl?  John?  Al?) has a
description of the mods that would have to be added to make this work, I
would love to hear about it.
