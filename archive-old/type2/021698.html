Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny Again

Thanks Chris,
Actually I'm less concerned about the engine than I am about the tranny. The motor was
rebuilt before I got it (thus the brazillian case) but the tranny is original.I kind of like
the idea of keeping as original of a motor as possible. I'm all for the KISS theory, whenever
possible.
However, a deterent for me keeping the tranny was also the shifting. It seems like the gears
are all over the place. Its more about guess work, than selecting of gears. Should it seem
this sloppy? I'm aware that the shifter is about 3 times longer than what I'm used to, so any
sloppiness would be magnified, but this seems really out there. You can move the the handle
about 6inches to the left of the gate for first/second, and about 4 inches to the right of
third/fourth. The overall 'sweep' (for lack of a better term) of Neutral is close to 24&quot;.
Once in in gear there also seems to be a lot of play.

&gt; Start reading the archives. There are long threads in there on making more

&gt;
&gt; But--- you could:
&gt;
&gt; Swap your 1600cc SP (single port) engine for a 1600cc DP (dual port) engine
&gt; - actually just swap the heads and then go to a doghouse oil cooler and fan
&gt; shroud.
&gt;
&gt; Move to an extractor type exhaust.
&gt;
&gt; Also a move to smaller type dual carbs - dual ICTs or baby Dells would
&gt; allow improvements in the area of the cam, heads (larger valves) and larger
&gt; exhaust.
&gt;
&gt; None of these little improvements will give you Mustang slaying power but
&gt; though somewhat conservative, can still return increased power, reasonable
&gt; gas mileage, and no loss of durability.
&gt;
&gt; Carefully choose your parts, some are rather poor quality. Just ask for
&gt; opinions on the list.
&gt;
&gt; It's going to be pretty slow by design - but if you get a chance drive
&gt; another bus of similar age and engine so you can be sure that your bus is
&gt; at least equal to it's the vintage peers.
&gt;
&gt; If your bus is significantly slower than another bus of the same age, then
&gt; I would be concerned that the engine isn't putting out the correct
&gt; horsepower or maybe a bearing or brake is dragging.
&gt;
&gt; As for your tranny - if it is working right, then I would stick with it.
&gt; There is no magical tranny that will give you more power and speed without
&gt; some trade off in some other category.
&gt;
&gt; VW chose the gear ratios as a middle ground - geared low enough to allow
&gt; the motor to cool right and high enough to run down the highway about 55 mph.
&gt;
&gt; You can put in a lower geared tranny and get better creeping power but
&gt; loose top speed.
&gt;
&gt; You could put in a higher geared tranny and have zero power at speed, risk
&gt; overheating because the fan is spinning slower (and the engine would
&gt; probably make more heat because it was working harder) but in theory the
&gt; motor would spin slower and make less noise (until it threw a rod). &lt;grin&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Now if you want to spend some money you could start collecting info (it's
&gt; been done) to install a Type IV 2.0 engine which won't make alot more
&gt; power, but there is a good improvement over a single port 1600cc. It will
&gt; last longer if properly maintained.
&gt;
&gt; Then you could dump alot of money into this engine and have alot of power.
&gt; Be sure to read the Type I vs. Type IV threads in the archives.
&gt;
&gt; If you are REALLY rich, take a look at Porsche 901 transmissions. There is
&gt; a myriad of gear ratios available so pick carefully. Your bus will require
&gt; about the same rpm's regardless of which tranny you put in with that same
&gt; engine.
&gt;
&gt; That all said, I would start reading anything you can get your hands on.
&gt; There are 50 years of writing on this very subject.
&gt;
&gt; Somebody said along time ago - &quot;Speed costs money, how fast you want to go?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Is your bus not putting out 100% of it's 50 or 60 HP, or are you expecting
&gt; more of it than it was designed to do?
&gt;
&gt; If it is the first choice then start tuning and adjusting (one thing at a
&gt; time - tune and test - mistake? Tune again. When that one item is right,
&gt; tune the next thing. It will teach you how one element of your bus affects
&gt; another). At least you can get the most out of what you already have. A
&gt; tune up can deliver a few horses and just a  few horses count alot when you
&gt; only have 50 or 60 to start with!
&gt;
&gt; If it is the second choice - then ask - is it REALLY important that you go
&gt; fast/have more power? $$$ If it is begin looking at your options. $$$ Don't
&gt; forget more speed is going to have require more suspension and braking
&gt; refinements which obviously cost more $$$ too. You don't wanna die right?
&gt; Most of all I don't want you to kill one of us out there sharing the road
&gt; with you cause you can't turn or stop.
&gt;
&gt; If is more power you seek - try to separate the show cars and hot rods with
&gt; short life span engines with an excess of chrome from the engines that will
&gt; take you far with a little more power. Money well spent in my book when you
&gt; get 100K miles from an engine versus one that lasts 42K miles.
&gt;
&gt; Another option is a transplant. Porsche 911 engines are sweet but you might
&gt; be able to buy 3 more busses for the cost. Water cooled transplants are
&gt; nice but you gotta hide a radiator somewhere. I am working on a Trans-vair
&gt; conversion (collecting parts more like it) with a plain Jane factory engine
&gt; that puts out 110 HP. Same gas mileage. These engines are good tough
&gt; engines too but require some creativity for installation (or with a
&gt; Trans-vair kit). I'll refine intake, exhaust and the heating systems before
&gt; I'm done.
&gt;
&gt; Again - start with the archives - it is full of discussion on this very
&gt; subject.
&gt;
&gt; Hope I didn't bore you, I ramble and try to cover a subject thoughly to
&gt; best of my knowledge.
&gt;
&gt; Ciao!
