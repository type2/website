Hello everybody,

Does anybody know the exact lenght of the acelerator rods between both 
carbs of the t4 2000'cc engine?
Need to do conversion of the normal acelerator system to dual carb cause
i swapped my engine.
In case nowbody knows the lenght, can anybody go by and messure it for 
me? Wanna finish the acelerator conections till my engine comes from the 
rebuild.
