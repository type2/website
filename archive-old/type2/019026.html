Surfer Bob points out that blocking the outlet pipes that blow out fan
air when heat is NOT on can damage the aluminum fins in the exchanger-
Yes I did that once, thinking &quot;more air to the cylidners&quot;....but then
the oil on the xchangers reached near ignition temperatures and
smoked...so I uncovered the outlets and never used the _at_^#$#%$heavy
pipes that also got in the way of doing valve adjustment checks- I think
that was about 150,000 mi ago!
