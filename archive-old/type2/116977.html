Subject: hose in nose cone of bus

while ripping out stuff from my front end trying to chase down a rusty
lower nose problem i found a black plastic flex hose hooked on one end to
nothing and hooked somewhere behind the vertical metal heater pipe.  the
hose is about 3 inches across.  what is it for and where does my loose end
hook to?
