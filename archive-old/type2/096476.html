Subject: Re: [T2] What size is the A/C belt?

Kendrew,

If no one else answers, let me know.

I cut mine off about a month ago, but saved it for future reference.

Depends on what type a/c you have and what kind of compressor.

Better to find your original for a match up.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I'm finally getting around to replacing the belt that runs from the A/C compressor to a pulley behind the fan shroud on my 78 automatic microbus.  I took the worn belt off last summer while I was taking the engine out to repair a dropped valve seat.  I think I've got the old belt here in my box of broken bus parts, but I never labelled it so...  
&gt; 
&gt; How big is it supposed to be?  Anyone know?
