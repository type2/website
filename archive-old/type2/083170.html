&gt; This is a tough subject, and in no way shape or form am I a chemical
&gt; engineer, nor a physicist--I do not have a degree in mechanical
&gt; engineering, nor in metallurgy---
&gt;
&gt;  I reflect upon the the principal's of seat of the pant's experience--

Terry, when you think with the seat of your pants, you are thinking with
the wrong end.

&gt; The Wright Bros, flew an aircraft, with no data whatsoever----

You have not been to Dayton, to Kitty Hawk, or to the Air and Space
Museum.  The Wright brothers spent years doing research, testing,
conducting experiments, retesting, developing new test methods, testing.
Each of the three museums I mentioned has *FEET* of shelving devoted to
actual hard data resulting from tests and experiments the Wright brothers
conducted.

&gt; Same with Edison and the light bulb--Marconi with the radio, and a whole
&gt; broad expanse of other's in the early days of trial and error---zero
&gt; documented data---

Again, you are simply wrong.  Edison's papers are preserved.  They are
voluminous.  They record actual data he collected over years of
experimentation.  The same is true of Marconi and every other pioneer.

&gt; And this is all I was attempting to convey to Tim and other's----
&gt; He is locked in to Mfg's recommendation and nothing else--according to
&gt; his prior statement's---
&gt;
&gt; If it ain't recommended by the factory --It ain't right.

NO, if it ain't recommended by the factory, you are on your own.  VW
maintains a large staff of engineers.  VW mantains a large test facility.
Every part is tested in the laboratory and on the street.  They compare
different alloys, different designs. When you go away from the proven and
tested designs, it becomes your responsibility to do the research, to
develop the test methods, to conduct the tests, and to present your
results in a form with more rigor than the bald statement that &quot;I BELIEVE&quot;
followed by an ad hominem attack.

&gt;  So with this in mind--and he being of the air cooled mentality ( today,
&gt; I remember when he was on the Vanagon list ), straight weight oil is the
&gt; optima best for you air cooled engine,

He is probably correct on that.   Karl von Salzen has also said that
multi-vis oils begin to break down at the temperatures our engines
typically run.

no sodium or titanium valves,

I don't remember ever hearing Tim say this.

&gt; and God help you if you convert your type 2 suitcase engine to hydraulic
&gt; lifter's, because the factory didn't supply them unit's with that
&gt; set-up---

Again, I don't remember Tim saying this.  Of course, VW *did* supply
engines with hydraulic lifters, so your point here is not valid.  Now if
you are talking about just popping hydraulic lifters onto a solid lifter
cam, well, it might work (we have amongst us experimental data that it
will), but there is a price... it does not work *as well* as using the
correct cam shaft.  But that would require data.  Which VW collected. By
doing tests.  Not by guessing.  Not by the seat of their pants.

&gt; No Petonix ignition---it must be point's or bust,

VW did supply electronic ignitions in later years, but whether they or the
Pertronix units are  an improvement is debatable.  Spare points and
condensor are smaller and lighter than a spare distributor and can be
installed in Ely, NV to get you home.

&gt; no platinum plugs, because this isn't correct--

No, not because it isn't correct.  Because platinum plugs are more subject
to oil fouling in our engines.  From actual tests.

and zero blue Bosch coils, it ain't factory original----

Again, nope.  I remember this discussion.  Tim's point as I remember is
that a coat of Blue paint is not worth the extra money.  That the Bosch
blue coil was as different from their regular coil as the Mercury Bobcat
was from the Pinto, and that $5 or 10 was a lot to pay for blue paint.
Just like it is a lot to pay when you pay $5-10/quart for 2-stroke oil,
which is what Marvel Mystery oil is.

&gt; All I'm trying to say here there are so many improvement's that can be
&gt; done to a Bus engine, including the use of Marvel, to increase the
&gt; reliability,and logevity,  of the air cooled engine waaaay beyond the
&gt; limits of the holy Bentley, or the factory issued repair manuals, that
&gt; are truly beneficial in the long run----

There are improvements that can be made. The way to make them is not to go
blindly grabbing cans of additives or chrome plated parts off shelves.
First, pick up and read the manuals.  Follow the advice contained in them.
I think you might be amazed at how well your bus can run with simple
proper maintainance, all of which is contained in the manuals you dismiss.
After you have the bus running well in factoy condition, then you test it
to develop a base data set. Then you can apply your hoped-for
improvements.

&gt; This is why I mention wearing blinder's in a prior message , regarding
&gt; this subject---- look beyond the stuck on stupid factory maintenance
&gt; recommendations --you'll be happier in the long run--and so will your
&gt; Bus---

Those are not blinders, those are eyeglasses.  They help you see more
clearly.  You can get them thru years of experience or thru years of study
but you can't get them thru the seat of your pants.
