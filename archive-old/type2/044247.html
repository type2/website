Subject: [T2] Matching trany

I have an option to buy a rebuilt engine from a man named Frank who lives in
Kansas City.  He has a 1973 DP rebuilt turnkey engine he wants to sell for
$500,00.  He has eight of them in his basement that he has rebuilt over the
years.

(1) I have a 1971 Westy with a 1967 trany.  Will
      the 1967 tranie fit a 1973 engine?

(2) I recently replaced everything in the bell
      housing.  Will I have to purchase another
      clutch kit or just a few parts.

Anyone.
