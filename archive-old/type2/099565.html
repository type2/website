Start by getting out your Bentley, and seeing if the signal from the column 
switch
is reaching the fuse block where the high beam relay plugs in.  If signal 
is good,
test relay.  If relay is malfunctioning, take it apart, clean and lube 
it.  If this doesn't
fix it (it probably will), buy a new one from Bus Depot.
