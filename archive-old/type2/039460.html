Subject: Fan motors

	I've figured out that my '71 bus is missing the dashboard switch
that controls the fan motors.  I also searched and searched in all the nose
air ducts and was unable to find any fan motors.  I've gotten the
impression that they are rare and sought after.  So why have fan motors
gone the way of the buffalo?  Are there no after-market replacements?  If
so, has anyone been successfull in fabricating their own?

TIA as always,
Adam in California
