Subject: Re: [Lifter grind]

Perhaps some clarification is in order:  A solid lifter from a 1974 VW type4
engine.  I'm asking because i've already spent shipping from and then back to
MOFOCO for their substandard grind/part/lack of QC.  
I want to be able to enlighten a machine shop on this process so maybe i can
get this done locally.

any info appreciated,
