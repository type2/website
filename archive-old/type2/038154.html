Subject: Re: Valve Cover Gaskets

Michael,
David is correct, it is easy, if you have the right tool to release and 
replace the bail wire. Probably there are a variety of &quot;favorite tools&quot; for 
this task. I use a conventional brake shoe star wheel adjusting lever that's 
beefy. (Too beefy for the VW rear shoe adjustment, more like for an American 
full size car). It is inexpensive and functional. Mine is one-piece, 7 
inches long from tip-to-tip. The center (handhold) is about 3 inches long, 
and the blades on either end are 2 inches long. The two blades are angled at 
about 20 and 45 degrees with respect to the handle, and are about 1/2 inch 
wide. The angling allows you to lever off the bail wire by placing an elbow 
(bend) of the tool on the valve cover surface and lightly prying the bail 
out of the slots in the valve cover without denting the cover. You can 
either lever in the center of the bail with the 45 degree end, or lever on 
alternate sides of the center using the 20 degree bend. Always pry the bail 
down off the cover for the bail clears the edge of the cover that way, 
rather than getting hung on the sheet metal if you pry the bail up. 
Replacement is the reverse of removal, pulling up the bail onto the cover by 
hand till it catches on the curved corner of the cover, then prying the bail 
the rest of the way into the slots in a series of small motions with the 
tool.
I just replaced mine a day ago, so recall the process well. 'Took about 2 
hours including cleaning the cover interiors, cylinder head mating surfaces, 
and very lightly applying wheel bearing grease to the surfaces of the new 
gaskets (as recommended by Sean Bartnik, in the Library piece on a related 
subject).
When I bought the gaskets at the FLVWPD, the partsperson was amazed that he 
found them to cost about $2 a piece. Ah, the good old days when VW parts 
were modestly priced; they must have overlooked this one!
So get a similar tool and go for it. No need to even jack up the van. Lying 
there on the garage floor gives you time to contemplate on the beauty of the 
underside of your beloved machine.
