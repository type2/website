Subject:  bus project for sale

Hello, my bus project is running out of time and energy and I'm offering it
to the list first before I present it to the rest of the world.  It's 74 bus
with a great incredibly rust free body without motor or tranny.  It was
originally a automatic bus but you can do what you want with it.  I also
have a rusty 76 automatic bus,  (complete with yellow jackets) that goes
with it.  I originally planned on putting the 76 autotranny in the 74 bus.
I have a strong running 2L motor and BA6 gas heater (complete) which goes
also.  All you need is time and elbow grease and  you can ride.  You get a
bus with a great body, a strong 2l FI motor which is in a running bus, a BA6
gas heater, a 76 parts bus with autotranny and 2l motor which doesn't run
for $2000.00 obo.  Contact me off list for more info and details.  Thanks,
Marcus
