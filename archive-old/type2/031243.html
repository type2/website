&gt;     I found a you-pull-it junkyard near me, and they have a 77 bus.  I
&gt; pulled some parts from it for my bus, but nothing really major.  Since
&gt; then I have been thinking about pulling the engine, and maybe the auto
&gt; trany.  The engine is $99 plus $15 core, which I'll have to pay, because
&gt; I won't have a core.  The trany is $59 + $15.
&gt; 
&gt;     Are these prices good for a 2000 fi and auto trans?  I don't know

very good prices for working ones, heck not bad prices for ones that need
work.

&gt; much about the automatic, but I'm sure I'd have to pull other things
&gt; like the shifter, and all the linkage, and maybe that would add up to
&gt; more than I want to spend.  I also want the engine to be mostly
&gt; turn-key, so i hope they won't charge me for all the relays and extra
&gt; parts on the firewall.

I would buy it BUT converting an manual bus to automatic is a lot of work.

don't forget tranny half shafts too, they are different than manuals
