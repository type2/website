&gt; Another way of thinking about it:  There was a good reason that VW put the
&gt; air inlets way up there and went to such pains to seal the engine and door

   Exhaust infiltration notwithstanding, not too many cars carry all the
engine
electrics that low in the body...Without the seals, both on the engine lid
and
the tin around the engine, a heavy rain and some deep puddles could quickly
drown the engine... ;-(
