       The really important number is not on the box, but on the bearing
itself. I'm rather surprised to find that no one has thus far compiled a
list of proper VW bearing numbers. I asked a week ago or so, but got
little response.
       If you have the bearing number (not box or VW part #) you can
just go to any bearing house and give them the number and get an exact
replica of the bearing. They don't have references for what applications
the bearings work in, but do have refs to cross for different
manufacturers.
        I'm starting to write down bearing numbers in my Bentley, but
only have the T4 pilot bearing number so far.
