Subject: pop-top conversion

I am considering installing a late model Westfalia Pop top on a late model =
transporter.  Obviously, the big frightening job is cutting the large hole =
into the roof.  Just how hard is this?  What kind of saw works best?  Is =
there any welding involved?  Anyone know of some good links that show this =
process step by step for installing a westy top on a late breadloaf?  I =
havnt come across any in great detail.  Any other comments or concerns are =
apreciated. =20
thanks,
C
