Subject: Re: KYB Home Gym and Shock Bolts


Did anybody get this? You probably have the shocks on by now.

&gt;Should the shock bolts be a higher grade than the &quot;Home Depot Bolt Bin&quot;
&gt;bolts?  Like a grade 5 or whatever?  My bus was missing back shocks and
&gt;bolts when I got it, and the ones that were shipped with my shocks (I
&gt;requested them) are too short.

I don't see why you would need grade 8 bolts. The worst thing that could
happen is that under some extraordinary abuse, the bolt might shear. If
that were to happen, the only consequence of it would be that the bolt
would be sheared and you've have to replace it. It's not like this is
holding your wheels on or anything.

I don't know what size the lowers are but if you still don't know I'll take
one off tomorrow and measure it, let me know.

&gt;On the bright side, based on the force required to compress those shocks, I
&gt;was afraid the back of the camper was going to shoot into the air when I
&gt;got them on. :-)   They should do well.  I hear good things about them.  I
&gt;think it will make the 'ole Westy ride well.

Actually you may not like the ride. You decide. In the bay, my Gas-A-Justs
(or whatever humiliating way that word is spelled) can do things like slurp
up huge speed bumps almost seamlessly. Which is good. But it beats every
*small* bump straight into your butt. Also they will not cure the crosswind
problem, that requires reinforced tires and sway bars.

Type2 Christmas Gift Exchange: (I hid mine in a message. Can't see it just
from scanning subject lines. Hah!) The footie. The hang ten 70s barefoot
accelerator thing that suddenly has a certain retro cachet around here.
Near perfect uninstalled condition. Lemme know.
