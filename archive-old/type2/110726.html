Subject: Re: [T2] fuel filter replacement questions

Hello,  
The only clean way of replacing the filter would be to
 Drain the tank first. Wear good ruber gloves, the
kind that cover most of your fore arms. I would first
make sure that the tank was empty or close to it. I
would then cut the fuel line as close as you can, just
in front (front means frot) of the fuel filter. Let
the remainder of the gas drain into a gas can. Now
remove the old filter and gas lines and reinstall  new
ones. There will still be some fuel in the lines when
your remove then and there will be fuel left in the
pump as well as the filter so just be careful. Trying
to replace the filter with fuel in the tank is no fun
and you WILL most likely end up with gas running down
your arms. I tend to learn the hard way. BTDT...

Have a great day!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; end up with gas pouring out
&gt; while I'm trying to attach the new hose?
