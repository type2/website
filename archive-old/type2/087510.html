Subject: The black vaccum can

I have a federal 81 Vanagon with a rebuilt stock motor. It is my first
rebuild. I have yet to get her to fire up though after many tries. The
troubleshooting process has yet to begin in any earnest. I started the
rebuild over a year ago and I forgot what the can is for. My question is...
Is the black can mounted on the left-front engine compartment with two
vacuum lines on it, one line from an aftermarket cruise control vacuum
servo and the other from the deceleration valve necessary? Is the can part
of the cruise control or what? I have removed all the CC stuff except for
the electronics under the dash at this time. I don't want it. Your help is
needed. I seem to be blind from frustration.
Thanks, Craig
