Subject: New Vacuum adv. dizzy isn't identical to old, can i use it or..?
Message-ID: &lt;374810BA.B507CED0_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Well I am all set to go change out the 009 dizzy(the one the mechanic
put in last week) with the new/used stock on my '77 2 litre fuel
injected bus.  I found that the new/used dizzy is a bit different than
the original that the mechanic pulled out.  The new one has 2 places to
attach hoses, the old one just had one.  The numbers on them are very
similar:
New dizzy: 0 231 181 005 (vw circle) 021 905 205N
Old dizzy: 0 231 168 005 (vw circle) 021 905 205P

Is my new/used dizzy just a different style but as far as how it works
the same, or is it the wrong type and should be returned, with me
searching for the exact same as I had in the bus prior to my mechanic
putting in a 009?

If it is ok to use the new/used dizzy, where should I run the hoses?  

Thanks,
Scoob
