&gt;My original equipment, low mileage (only 172k miles)
&gt;transmission has recently began shifting into 1st and
&gt;3rd with what I would describe as a squishy feeling.
&gt;Shifting into 2nd, 4th and reverse still has a
&gt;positive feeling, a definite click. This has only
&gt;started in the last month. Is this an internal
&gt;transmission problem, meaning I should start looking
&gt;for another tranny, or could this be a linkage problem
&gt;that I can tighten or replace worn parts? TIA

The shift link is a likely candidate. Check that first.
A loose pinch bolt or worn bushings can cause this
symtom. It is not likely that 1st and 3rd gears would
both loose their syncro teeth at the same time or
the different shift forks for those two gears would
both wear at the same rate. Therefore, it strongly
suggests slack in the linkage, either at the link
and/or at the shift lever fulcrum or business end
below floor level.
