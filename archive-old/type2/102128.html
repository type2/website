&gt; Here is the descrition of the mystery hose;
&gt;
&gt; The larger--aprox. 1/2&quot;--vacuum line from the Tee,
&gt; coming out of the air distributor, that goes through
&gt; the fire wall tin and to the brake booster has a
&gt; plastic Y in it about 12&quot;-15&quot;  forward from the
&gt; firewall. The Y partion of this is a 3.5mm hose
&gt; pointed back towards the engine compartment. There is
&gt; another inline componant just before this location
&gt; that I believe is a one-way gate to block pressure
&gt; from a backfire from entering brake booster.

Sounds like you have the brake booster line hooked up correctly:

Page 18 of the Automatic Transmission (AT) chapter in Bentley shows a
similar Y on the other side of the firewall on an older T4 engine.

I believe this Y is a piece only installed on busses with AT. Someone else
on the list had a problem recently with this tee on his 76 and he had a
screw shoved in the hose. His engine died when he removed it because he had
a MT and there was no where for the hose to go: major vacuum leak.

If you have a MT like he has, you'll need to block off the hose because it's
a transplant from another bus, otherwise the 3.5mm hose hooks up to the
vacuum unit on the AT.

Did you figure out where the temperature switch (022 131 519) goes? I wonder
if it's for the transmission also...
