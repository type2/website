&gt; whole time. I did the dipstick checks all the time and the engine always

&gt; would be great. What would a good rebuild cost and what company should I

&gt; baltimore took me from 9:00pm Saturday to about 6:00 today(sunday)

Casey,
Is this the same engine with &quot;700 miles on it?&quot;
What did the PO have to say, assuming you called them to ask what's up?
When you pulled the wire off #3 &amp; #4, did you have spark to those wires?
Are your wires each on the correct cylinder?
