Oh, experienced ones,

I am looking to convert my 74, 1800cc stock dual solex setup to a fuel injection system from a 79 non-California and was wondering if anyone has any experience on doing this.  Basically, what components will need to be replaced?  The following is what I have come up with as far as what will need replaced:

1. Heads
2. Intake manifolds
3. Fuel pump

I also think that I would either have to replace the fuel tank or at least modify it.  Is there anything that I have missed or overlooked?  If anyone has done this before, I would really appreciate some feedback on what was involved.

Thanks
