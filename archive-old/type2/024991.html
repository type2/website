&lt;&lt; as ive never seen a bus with a working 
 e-brake.  &gt;&gt;
 
     There are ones out there with working e-brakes! When I bought my '76 the 
e-brake didn't work, lived with it for two years before one weekend I decided 
I was going to work on it 'til it was fixed. After hours of trying to adjust 
everything every possible way, I was ready to  call Goodwill and donate it! I 
finally enlisted my wife to help, having her work the brake while I watched 
the levers in the hub move-what I found is that there is a right and a left 
lever, and if they are reversed, the brake will not work, as the lever can't 
pull the shoes tight enough against the drums. Funny thing was the PO had 
given me all his receipts, one was for a brake job ($260.00!) just two months 
before I bought it, and he said the e-brake had not worked since the brake 
job, so they most likely switched the levers.    Jeff S.
