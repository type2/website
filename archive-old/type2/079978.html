&gt; Autozone will lend out tools for freezies if you buy parts from them.  I

...actually, you dont have to buy parts from them.  (or maybe you do and
my face was always very well known...mm. naw, i even sent mom to pick up a
tool once..)

mind you, you DO have to pay them their full price of the tool, but it is
refunded upon return.

&gt; As for a valve spring compressor, do get the C-clamp type not the
&gt; thumbscrew type.  I seem to remember getting mine from Sears for a
&gt; reasonable price, and I've ended up using it several times, not to mention
&gt; the times I've loaned it out.

yeah...the sears jobby is about..oh..20-25 bucks?  It works, but on type1
head beware that you've gotta toy with it to get it down into the
rockerbox without tearing up the gasket surface for the valve cover.

(otoh, of the 4 or 5 different &quot;econo&quot; variations of these compressors,
this one did work best.  and its pretty much equally priced to the lesser-
quality-but-identical-design one that JCW sells.)
