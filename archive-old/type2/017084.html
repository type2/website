Subject: Oil Temp sender Q's

I finally got my oil temp gauge installed yesterday.  I drove around for
15 minutes or so and the gauge (VDO) never got over 130 degrees F.
Shouldn't the temp rise faster than that?  BTW, I'm at 5400 feet above
sea level and it was probably 35 degrees F or so outside.  Assuming the
gauge is calibrated and wired correctly, that leaves the temp sender.  I
really don't know much about the sender, except it was supposed to be
the correct one.  I installed the sender in the oil sump plate on my 78
2.0L engine.  Actually, I had the FLAPS install the sender, as they had
to weld the nut onto the inside of the sump plate.  Apparently the weld
is pretty pourous, as oil leaks out around the sender and spreads onto
the female connector.  Could this be a problem?

I'd appreciate any comments on my predicament.  Thanks-

Alabama Pete in Boulder, CO and Kate the '78 Westy
