Subject: Re: Farfignugen!!

&gt;I'll be completely honest, I never thought in a million years that I'd be buying a farfignugan... I really just bought it for my fiancee. 

What the heck is a farfignugan?  :-)  Since VW only came up with that neologism (Deutsch for something like &quot;pleasurable driving experience&quot;) long 
after they abandoned our vehicles, I'd stay away from fahrvergnugen unless referring to waterpumpers.  What you have is an actual Volkswagen.

&gt;Even though everyone that sees me working on it thinks I'm a tree hugging hippie... I still think this car is totally cool. 

See, you're missing the point.  That's *why* it's totally cool!
