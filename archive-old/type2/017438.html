Subject: Fuel Injection?

Get this....I got the  `80 ( bus )-lorax over to my new house, had to
pull start him w/ my ford escort( that was funny site) 
I get him parked the motor warm and turn him off till next time when,
this buzzing starts (or has been since he moved) I crawl under to find
this lil' grey box  just a buzzin away-seemed to be connected to the
battery some how so I unhooked the bat. no more buzzin'
Next time I go to wake up lorax he doesn't seem to be gettin' any gas,
you know turning over just fine just no catch. The buzzin' came back... 
so I go get some gas..maybe not enough in the tank or to fill the
injector...get the gas fill him up the tank starts leakin' all around
the back edges..SH*T...So I syphon some gas out ..yuk ..yuk  the leak
stops without geting any more than a gallon or so out. OK so correct me
if I'm wrong...Fuel injector is clooged or the line from the tank to the
injector is clogged. That is what's buzzing?--
