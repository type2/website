Subject: engine types, oil temps and thermostats

With all the recent post concerning oil temps and engine types in type 2's, I
wonder if someone could give a short description of all the types of engines
that people run in their buses.  I have a 71 Westy with a type 3 engine.  Is
this similar to the type 1 1600 but with a different compression ratio?  I
don't seem to have a thermostat or at least I don't see it.  Does conventional
wisdom ( or even unconventional) suggest one be installed?  It just seems the
variations of engine types, etc are quite vast.  Don't mean to start a
controversy, just want some input.
Steve
