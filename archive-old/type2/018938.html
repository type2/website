I apologize for wasting bandwidth with redundant questions... I can see
now why I got so few responses to my questions! I didn't even know what
a FART was until now! :))

This is a great list and a great bunch of people, and I am proud to be a
type two owner again - It's better than a Harley.. it has a fridge to
keep the beer cold! :)
