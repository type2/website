How about an obvious panel (I really like engine-turned aluminum or even 
stainless steel) with a single large red indicator light and an industrial 
strength toggle switch, all clearly labeled:

EXPLOSIVE BOLTS ARMED


&gt;&gt; Perhaps I should install a kludgy aluminum control panel with key switches 
labeled &quot;Alarm&quot;, &quot;Sarin&quot; and &quot;High Voltage&quot;!  :) &lt;&lt;
