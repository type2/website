Subject: Temp sensor II

Well, I have been looking for this sensor for weeks everytime I
work on the bus. Could never find it. Bentley gives a good
description of where it is, I still could not find it. Karl
recently posted how to find it. Follow the main loom on the drivers side,
one bundle to the double relay, one to the #3 injector, one to the
#4 injector and then the single wire to the sensor...except my
single wire did not go to cylinder #3, it went back across the engine
to cylinder #2. It was screwed into the head just to the rear of
intake #2. It looked like some sort of sheet metal screw was screwed
into where I think the temp sensor should be..just to the front
of intake #3. I couldn't get it out on my initial attempt. I don't
know how bad the threads are messed up. So how bad off am I leaving
the sensor by #2?
