&gt;hey group, I'm troubled with a question.....  My 74 single cab runs

Adjust your throttle stops 1/2 turn out (each).  That should decrease the idle, then you can open up the big idle screw to bring the idle speed back up.

&gt;...I have an SVDA distributor on this baby, therefore the timing is set at 7.5 BTDC.   Logic is telling me that if I had the dual vac distributor on it, which would retard the 
&gt;timing at idle, I'd get more adjustment out of my big idle screw on the left carb, since at idle, the retard would slow the engine down allowing me to turn the idle speed screw open some to speed it up.

While the above is true, the reason for your lack of adjustment range with the big idle screw is that your throttle stops are set too far in, not because of the type of distributor you are running.

&gt;Am I causing any harm by driving with the idle 
&gt;speed screw screwed all the way in?

Nope, but you're not utilizing the central idling system that way.
