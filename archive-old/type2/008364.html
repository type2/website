Subject: Need a favor: 1600cc DP part
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello everyone,

I need a favor from someone who has a larger bonepile
than I have.

I bought a new universal case a while ago, and now I am
building the engine. But, the case I have does not
have an oil pickup tube.

If someone has a junked 1600cc DUAL-RELIEF case, no good
to anyone, with a decently non-rusty oil
pickup tube in it, I would pay shipping in advance
to get it. They can be hard to remove, but not if
you dont care about the case....

No need to clean it, just drop it in a plastic
baggy and send it to me.

(I must have thrown out a dozen of them in 
trashed engines, now I need one...)

Thanks,

- Chris Chubb (cchubb_at_codegurus_dot_com)- Northern Virginia, USA
