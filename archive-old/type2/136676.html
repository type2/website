&gt; Alternator conversion kits typically come with an alternator pedestal (the

&gt; modification), three fan mounting tin pieces (which are very thin compared
&gt; to the original German pieces),

I've looked at the tin from the alternator kit and I can't tell any
difference between that tin and the type 1 (30A) generator tin.
