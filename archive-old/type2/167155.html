Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper replacement

Believe it or not, trying to stick a reciever under
the existing setup is more of a process than simply
building a nice bumper to start with.
And cheaper.. they start at $130 and up.
Why would you think there is more labor involved?
just an additional 15 min of welding and it bolts
right back into the old bumpers position, same holes.

Just curious here James,

Why are you hanging a Rube looking steel channel bumper on the back end
of your Bus just for the sake of taking some pedal power bikes along,
when you you could just hang a receiver to accommodate a bike rack under
the stock bumper.

Mack Truck tough is good---but I think a stock bumper not only would
look better, but you could get a hitch under it that would do the job a
bunch cheaper, and without all the ruby laborious acts.
