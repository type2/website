Subject: Chainsaw Bar oil

I recently bought a quart of chainsaw Bar oil with the intention of
spraying it under my bus for rust prevention per an article I read on the
WWW. I wanted to use a air-energized spraycan for this. Trouble is, the oil
is so darn thick I can't get it to do anything but ooze out of the spray
nozzle. Is there a good solvent to thin this stuff out some?? Gasoline??
mineral spirit? Kerosene?
