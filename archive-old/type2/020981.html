Subject: Bus security

Hello List,

I'm wondering how to keep my bus as reasonably secure from break-ins
and theft  as possible. For example: I'm putting a latch lock on the
engine
hatch to prevent people from helping themselves to engine parts or a
battery.

My other concern is of theft of the whole bus itself. I am  considering
one of those anti-theft &quot;clubs&quot;.
Do these things work? Are they worth the $70.00 ( Canadian )?

What do you suggest and what have been your experiences?
