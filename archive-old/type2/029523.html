&gt; &gt;Don't travle alone and personally, I would never
&gt; &gt;stop at a rest stop. There are State Parks all
&gt; &gt;over
&gt; &gt;the country where people are required to register
&gt; &gt;their names and vehicles. That is a much safer
&gt; &gt;place
&gt; &gt;to stay the night.

The problem is that the bad guys don't register.

I usually stay either in a very public place (truck stop, etc) or
somewhere so far out in the boonies that the bad guys won't go to the
trouble to find you.

Safety in numbers is always the best bet.  Take along a friend or five.
