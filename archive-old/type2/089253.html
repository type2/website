*snip*
&gt; Next question....anyone have any experience with this seemingly one of a
&gt; kind dizzy?
&gt;
&gt; Received a note from John at air-cooled, said they are available only one
&gt; place.  Hmmmm, are these special tricked up configurations that have
proven
&gt; to work?
&gt;

I installed this SVDA distributor on my 74 1.8 ltr with Weber progressive
carb and it is great! Performance improved at high end and on hills. Gas
mileage went up +3mpg. Go ahead and order with no worries.

Regards,
Dave
