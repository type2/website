Subject: Cost efficiency of points replacement

Using the Pertronix, which a part from being  hard to install (the magnetic
collar just barely goes on the distributor shaft and needs real force
(hammer handle)) work perfectly.  It already saved me a new distributor.
Mine, with only 90K miles on it had enough runout  that I could not keep a
steady dwell.  The maybe 10 thou slop was enough to affect the timing and
dwell.   Since the Pertronix operates off the physical proximity of the
collar (30 thou) the run out does not affect it at all and the dwell and
timing never changes.   It is not only easier than points, and cheaper but
it will cure a worn distributor.  Gets my vote, every time ( and just WHY
are condensers, which really never fail, cost so much.  I think you could
get away with just replacing the points without any problem.
