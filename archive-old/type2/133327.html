FI installs can be tricky, but here is one case when Doc Tim is really
righht on the money, follow the trouble shooting guide, if you don't have
one it is in the library, or drop me a private e-mail and we can figure

&gt; I have gathered and installed a complete group of FI components.  I
&gt; have a 7-wire AFM. The ECU has an orange sticker on it. Everything is
&gt; bolted up tight, and all the vacuum lines are present and accounted

&gt; nice juicy spark at the plugs. I am NOT getting fuel spray from the
&gt; injectors.

ah hah!

.   is the resistor pack good

hook a simple circuit tester light or VOM across one of the injector plugs
and see if it &quot;flickers&quot;

&gt; negative side.

terminal #1  right
