Subject: RMMW catalogues

To all of you who are unable to get RMMW catalogues....(Richard, yours 
should arrive tomorrow in the mail)...I was there today to purchase new plug 
wires for my bug, and they are totally out of the current catalogue.  The 
new one comes out in May.  I am down to my last copy of the current one and 
I plan to greedily hang on to it.  Sorry I won't be able to grab any more 
for the rest of you, but when the new one does come out if anyone doesn't 
get one and needs one, let me know.  Also, could someone please pass this 
info on to the type 1 and type 3 lists if you are on them?  Thanks!

Mary
