Hello All:
I *think* I have a bad AFM, but when testing the ohms it checks out.
I had a remanufacutured NAPA AFM in my '77, but decided to keep the
020 AFM that was original in the '79 bus I had. 

When I got everything hooked up and started the bus. I had to tap the 
gas pedal a little to keep it running, then as it warmed  up a little
it would idle on its on but real low rpm. Adjusting the idle adjustment
screw didnt increase or decrease the idle....
also, #1 cylinder was firing, but not right... pulling #1 plug wire
didnt get the results of pulling #2-4.....

I went to checking the FI stuff with the Bentley and the Haynes manuals.
I realized if I unplugged the AFM it would fire right up and idle nicely.
if i touched the gas pedal at all it would die.

I pulled the AFM that was in the '77 and installed it. Vr00m!
It fired right up and idled nicely. idle was adjustable via the idle screw
and #1 cylinder is firing just like the others....

So... i figured I had a bad AFM.
But... I checked the pins with a multimeter and get these readings:
6 &amp; 7  =   60
6 &amp; 8  =  180
6 &amp; 9  =  300
7 &amp; 8  =  160
8 &amp; 9  =  100
6 &amp; 27 = 1900
which according to the manuals and posts I found in the archives these are
within spec.....

I reinstalled the &quot;bad&quot; AFM and all the symptoms returned. I put the &quot;good&quot;
one back in and all the symptoms disappeared.

Is this a bad AFM? is there something I am missing??
could this be a problem of mixing FI parts from the '77 to the '79???

any advice?

thanks!
Rob
'79 westy

ps. Called Universal today and they are sending me a CDI unit COD. I'll
let you know the results once it arrives and I get it installed.
