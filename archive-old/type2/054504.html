Subject: Re: heavy bus hauling

I used to work for a small time coffee roaster, used to pick up bags of raw 
beans (_at_ 70 Kilos ea.) with an early vanagon... stacked them from floor to 
ceiling in the center and a few over the motor and hauled them from south SF 
to Petaluma - 65 miles.  Did this 3-4  times a week for a year, plus used it 
(wasn't named for some reason) for doing restaurant deliveries and repair 
calls...  Learned to be *very* gentle on hills, stay in the right lane, and 
take your time... The only problem we ever had was 1-brakes kept wearing out, 
and 2-the tranny went out at 210K.  First time I thought it'd never make it 
over the waldo grade... and was glad there was no traffic n the downhill side 
(those in SF *know* what I'm talking about!)...

Anyway, the owner lived for years overseas before moving here and starting 
his business... he used to talk about all the uses VW vans and P/U's were 
used for there (and the loads on them), and was why he chose a Vanagon for a 
co. vehicle...  He said after living with that, he didn't trust &quot;american 
vans&quot;... We *did* have a ford 1 ton van, but it was *always* in the shop, so 
I guess he was on to something!

Have a great weekend!
