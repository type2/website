Subject: Re: [T2] Now what?!?  69 bus tire/ brake issues

&gt; I finally got the new tires on the 69 camper today 185R14 D rated.
&gt;
&gt; The tire place had a hell of a time getting them balanced due to an
&gt; adjustable adapter that was not working right, so I am not sure they are

Would a place that can do on the car balancing be able to do them?
I havent tried that but have thought about it. The last time I got 2
tires they couldnt balance them and I just said 'fugetaboutit' and drove
on.
