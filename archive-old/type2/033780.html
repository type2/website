Subject: 1600DP - Alternator - Fuel Pump Question.

I just finished building a 1600 engine and used an Alternator
instead of the stock Generator for my '71 Bus. No problems
there. 

But, I have eaten two fuel pumps so far. The rocker foot 
in the bottom has been broken off. That would lead
me to believe that the pushrod is too long, but I used a 
pushrod from an Alternator style Beetle. 

Is the phenolic block under the fuel pump a different thickness?
Could the fact that I have a new Mexican universal case 
and a new distributor drive affected it? I didn't use
any more thrust washers under the Dist. drive. I dont want to
eat up any more pumps. I dont want to use an electric.

&lt;Rant&gt;
Has anyone seen what is passing for a pump pushrod these
days? I have two from two different sources and both look
like someone took gutter nails and cut them to length. Plus,
the bottom foot has been ground to a point, minimizing area and
maximizing wear. Does anyone still make a good pushrod with
a smoothly radiused and hardened end?
&lt;/Rant&gt;
