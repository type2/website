Use some J.B Weld epoxy.  Sometimes it's called liquid weld.
Just mix some up, put a little on the threads, put your fitting in and then
put the
excess around the base to close in hairline cracks.

Just follow the directions on the package.

This is also some of the BEST glue ever made.

Subject: Re: Vacuum Leak

I had to tap into the intake manifolds for vacuum for my brakes. Now the 2.0
won't pass emissions because of a vacuum leak. Does anybody know any tricks
for sealing vacuum leaks at the fittings. I can't get teflon tape or pipe
sealant to work. The tap seems too tight.
