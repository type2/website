Subject: RE: [T2] heating project?

Their is a company in the UK that makes a propane heater just like the old
gas ones. It vents outside and everything. I just cannot remember the name,
Propex?? Anyway, they have an advertisement in the newest Camper magazine
from the UK. I will look tonight if nobody on the list knows the company. 

I have thought about this option because the heater is new. It cost about
$500. 

Let me do some looking and I will find the web site for you.
