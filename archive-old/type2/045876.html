Subject: [T2] FI won't start but will crank (memo to the archives)

Volks,

This is to let you know that one common (and inexpensive :) reason why an
FI bus won't start, even tho it will crank is that FI demands more of the
battery.  Not only must it have enough power to crank the engine, there
must be enough left over to supply a minimum of 9.5 volts to the FI
&quot;brain&quot; so that it will fire the injectors.

One interesting thing about FI is that it is more demanding of the battery
than carbs are.  If a carb engine has enough battery to crank, it has
enough to start.  The spark plugs will fire at any voltage that will crank
the engine and fuel feed is by vacuum (or mechanical pump), so if the
engine is in running condition, then if it will crank, it will start.

FI adds an extra load into the equation, the FI &quot;brain&quot;.  Being an
electronic gizmo, it is right picky about the voltages it recieves.  Give
it too much and it releases it's &quot;magic smoke&quot; and no longer works at all.
Give it too little and it will not work either (tho the situation is
nowhere near as permanent :)

The FI brain needs 9.5 volts in order to operate.  If it does not have
them, it does not fire the injectors, the bus gets no gas, and it will not
start! Measuring the voltage at the battery with the engine off tells you
very little about battery condition.  What counts is what gets to the
brain while you are cranking the engine.  The way to check this is to
remove the plug from the brain and check the voltage at terminal 4 (count
up from where the wires enter the plug) while the car is being cranked.  
If you have less than 9.5 volts, then you need to charge the battery!

The reason for this post is that I did get the bus I bought from Mark
Kaylor running today.  He had gotten a diagnosis of a dead brain because
the engine would crank, but would not start.  The brain was fine, but the
battery was (partially) dead...  A no-cost repair (charge the battery) vs.
a $200 repair! (OK, it took me 2 trips to Lancaster, PA (100 miles each
way) to figure this out :-))

Now... on to step 2!  The bus did run, but it leaks oil like a sieve, the
fuel lines are all original, and it sounds like a race car as it sits
there idling (really, really loud!). Before I move it, I am going to
change all the fuel lines (I intend to take pics, hopefully I will write
them into a page :-), I am going to drain the oil and see if I can't fix
at least the worst of the oil leaks, and I gotta tear the exhaust off it
and see what is happening there (I am already imagining the condition of
the studs on the heads (shudder!))
