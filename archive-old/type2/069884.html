Subject: breadloaf sagging

They do sag over time, although part of it might just be an optical
illusion. When viewing the bus from the side and from a distance, you are
also seeing part of the supporting frame. You'll notice that the two long
front/back beams are wedge shaped and give an impression of slope. If
you're parked on smooth and straight (though not necessarily level)
ground, you can use a tape measure and measure the distance of rocker to
ground, right behind the front wheel and right in front of the rear wheel. 

If there is real sagging, you may want to check your rear shocks first,
not because they're the likely cause, but because they're so much easier
to replace. Only way I know of checking them is to remove them and see how
easily you can compress them by hand. The bouncing test described in
Bentley (you know, step on the rear bumper and see how long the bus
oscillates) does not work; it didn't work for me (passed the test with
shocks actually removed) and Bob Hoover confirmed that torsion bars,
unlike springs, do not lend themselves to such a test. 

Another reason for sagging could the rotting of the 2 fat doughnuts where
a torsion bar meets the springplate; but to replace those, you will
basically have to follow the same procedure as when readjusting the
torsion bars. Just make sure you buy those doughnuts (West Coast Metric
has them) before you take things apart.
