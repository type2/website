Gosh!

Were someone close to bankrupcy, I'd try to get everyone I could to do 
business with him to help him out, not tell them to back off!  MAYbe 
volunteer as his accountant 'till he gets out of the red!  Esp. someone who 
has talent like him - and I don't even know the guy, just his reputation!
