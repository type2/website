&gt; I have a 72' bus with a new engine and carbs;  after driving 3-10 days I 
&gt;will come out in the morning to find enough gas in the cylinders to prevent 
&gt;the engine from turning over;  gas has also leaked into the oil.   This has 
&gt;occurred about 6 times now!   What is causing this problem?  What is the
fix? 
&gt; Does living at a 7000 ft elevation influence this?

Be sure you fix this soon. Carbs can go way rich for several reasons. The
floats have sunk, or the float needle valve is foul. or the needle valve
seat is loose, or the float level needs adjustment, or the jets are loose,
or the fuel pressure is too high. You must tear down the carbs to verify
the cause.

When you get it resolved, change the oil and the spark plugs. Plugs loose
their insulation when soaked in gas. At your elevation, if the carbs were
adjusted for sea level, you could be just adjusted too rich, which would
lead to buildup of gas in the oil and fouled plugs. 

I wouldn't run the motor again till I got it fixed, cause the damage could
well be costly, like motor destruction, or bus cremation.
