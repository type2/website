Subject: Re: [T2] Turn signal switch

Mike,

You have *not* been paying attention!!!  Replace *ALL* of
the fuel lines...NOW!

Sorry for the yelling, but that's before Chris or one of the other guys
gets ahold of you....his mission in life is to make sure everyone replaces 
their old fule hoses now!!!

You might as well add a *good* fire extinguisher to your list
of needed parts as well.

Don't wait, do it!

Glad that you didn't burn, dave

&gt; &gt; Hooked it up and the [dash] lights are back on...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Replaced all of the fuel line from the pump to the carb.  The line between
&gt; the final filter and the carb was dry rotted, so maybe the pump going out
&gt; was God looking out for us.
