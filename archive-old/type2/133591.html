Subject: Re: [T2] vasoline and rubber hoses

i'll probably get flamed for this but that is half the fun i guess :).  in
my neck of the woods i generally see the off gassing of rubber compounds
to be more common than degradation of rubber compounds from greases.  off
gassing causes rubber to shrink/crack and become brittle.  kind of like
asphalt when you don't replenish its solvents.  that said too much
solvent/oil can be a bad thing and deteriorate rubber.

for years i worked on industrial and commercial fleet vehicles.  i
concluded over time that it was better to grease coolant hoses, intake
boots, and some other hoses than to struggle and damage them in the
process of getting them off the next time.  in the 10 years or so that i
did this i never saw any problems and all the systems that i worked on
came apart fairly easily the next time i worked on them.  the biggest
problem i ever ran across was that the grease dried out over extended
periods.  that caused hoses to stick to barbs and fittings but nothing
like the corrosion that i was trying to defeat in the first place.  to get
the grease rehydrated lift the end of the hose and shoot a shot of spray
oil in and off the hose comes.

i will say stay away from oils as i have seen lots of hoses fail due to
getting regular engine oil baths.  for my applications i used mostly wheel
bearing or similar grease because it was handy in the shop.  i'm going to
go out on a limb as i don't know but i think silicone grease like the kind
that is used on vacuum systems might be the best approach.
