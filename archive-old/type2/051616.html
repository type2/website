Subject: RE: [T2] Filler neck

&gt; No affiliation with them boys, but I remember trying to fix my
&gt; durn neck....  The part is in stock!

Yes, this is the fuel filler neck for '74-79. Part number 211 201 119.  I
have had these for several months now, for about half the price: $19.95
(minus additional 5% listmember discount if part of a $50-plus order).
