&gt; Thanks to all for the advice on how to pull my windshield .. Once the metal
&gt; area is free of rust, primered and clean, which is preferred: Rubber cement 
&gt; or an RTV of some sort?  

I'm in the same process - replacing seals (can't decide between harbor or
Weddell - some Friday zoo humor there) .. while at www.cbperformance_dot_com  I
ordered some Gorilla Snot (very descriptive) weatherstrip adhesive, and it's
worked out well.  A bit pricey, but the seals stay put.  I don't have a tube in
front of me so I don't know who manufactures it (3M??)
