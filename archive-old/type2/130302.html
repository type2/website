Subject: Re: [T2] oil breather with filler cap

&gt;the oil filler tube is gone and has been blocked off with a
&gt;fabricated plate. 

You should check your engine code to see what this motor was originally used
in.  Various applications for the type IV motor did not use the oil filler
tube like the buses do.  You may find that adding the proper oil filler tube
is more involved than removing the plate you're seeing.  

As for the breather with the filler cap, as you noted the 411's used them.
Some (but not all) 914's had them too.  They're somewhat coveted since any
914 owner that doesn't have one wants one, but they can usually be had for
$10-20.
