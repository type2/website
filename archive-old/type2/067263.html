Subject: BUS CARPETS

This weekend, I plan, I my grand scheme for putting my bus back
together, to MAKE MY OWN CARPETS....?

Am I being a little too optimistic here?  Well, here's my plan...

I plan to cover the floor of the bus, which I have painted with water
repelling rubber paint stuff, with board...then to lay underlay...then
to purchase a rubber backed thin carpet.

I plan to lay the carpet in the rear of the bus as well as the through
the walkway, and into the cab itself.  This method I figure should help
reduce both road and engine noise.

I fortunately have the original mats from the front of the bus, and have
cut out the board for the back - these I can use as templates for the
carpetting...my only concern here is whether the carpets will need to be
bound at the edges or not....I figure they shouldn't fray given that
they have rubber backs.

I also plan to put the carpet underneath the drivers and passengers
seats, where the nasty rubber stuff was originally - mainly 'cuase this
has fallen to bits, but also 'cause it's very nasty!  This I will then
glue on using....what?  I guess some sort of carpet glue, if such a
thing exists...?

I'll finally buy some cheapo car mats for the drivers and passengers
feet.

'WHY'...I hear you ask...'WHY' don't I just *buy 'em*?!  

Well - a) they cost a fortune....such a con! b) I'll enjoy doing it -
makes my bus *feel* like *my* bus! and c) I can colour code them with
the rest of the bus interior....

Has any one else undertaken this type of thing - how did you get on -
did they fray, did they reduce engine noise...?

How easy were they to cut out...any tips for doing so?

Any ideas on the glue?



Thanks for your help Volks!

Jonathan.
