***********I'm telling you guys this caper would make Bus history---
Hands down--*************


Hands up here and my feet. Let's get this thing rolling.


**********But think about how we could centrally loctate this 
event---********

Anybody care to setup a webpage or forum? Pic post, bulletin, etc. East vs. 
West, what about you guys North of the Border? When does outdoor body work 
season begin for the Canadian Tribe?

TravelOn,
