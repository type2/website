Subject: Re: [T2] CAT vs EGR (or both?)

My &quot;Smog Check Vehicle Inspection Report&quot; lists the check for the EGR as:

EGR (Visual)

so I'd guess having all the parts there and connected, even if non-working
is sufficient.  Of course, the actual test is also looking for NO, so you've
got to pass that test as well.

Subject: [T2] CAT vs EGR (or both?)

&gt; Is there anyone out there passing CA smog without the EGR stuff in place?
&gt;
&gt; maybe just a nice tight exhaust system and a brand new CAT would do the
&gt; trick, or should I just start working now to find all of these parts?
&gt;
&gt; I need a crossover pipe, CAT, and all of the EGR stuff currently. (thats
&gt; whats missing anyway)
&gt;
&gt; the EGR stuff is all blocked off, almost looking like it never came with
it,
&gt; but from the Mcode I guess it did at some point.
&gt;
&gt; I just wasnt sure if one of those systems would be effective enough in
&gt; reducing emitions to warrant skipping the other.
&gt;
&gt; thanks for any leads
