Subject: Re: [T2] cold start problems

I'd first check the ground wires from the injectors under the air box.
Check the ground wire from your double relay. Check the Cylinder head
sender for frayed or broken wire and bad connection.
To adjust the AFM, screw down richer, screw out leaner. (start out at
about four full turns up from the bottom). Shoot for spark plugs the
color of coffee with cream and you'll be running about right. If you
leave your injection set to the requirements to pass emissions test
you'll run too lean and build heat, drop your valve seats and detonate
your heads also ruining your head surface and piston tops. Also seen
cutting on the top perimeter of the pistons as well as collapsed piston
ring lands from running too hot and too lean.
