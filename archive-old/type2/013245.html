Subject: 009 w/ electronic ignition and 30 PICT-3

Hey Volks,

Last night I helped a friend put a &quot;Compufire dizzy-contained electronic 
ignition&quot; into
his '67.  I hadn't seen anything like this little monster before -- an 
electronic ignition in
a 009 all ready to go, just pop it in -- if nothing else, it was 
interesting to examine.

So, having put it in, we went to time it (30 degrees BTDC at full 
advance) and found
that we were only getting 18-22 degrees of total advance and that the 
advance
curve seemed to be stopping at ~2500 rpm.

This seemed odd to me and I figured that something was wrong, but I 
figured I'd pick the
collective brain to see if this could be &quot;normal&quot; or if it's because 
it's a type 1 engine
or because of the electronic ignition.  I am thinking that neither of 
these should have
anything to do with the advance characteristics, that only the 009 has 
anything to do
with the total advance, but in the 009's that I've run, they all seemed 
to have a bit more
than 18-22 degrees of total advance -- more like 25-35.

So, does this sound like a problem with the dizzy, or...?

I'm cross posting to type2 as the 30 PICT-3 and 009s seem to be a little 
more of the
t2 realm than the vintagebus realm.

Oh, and as a parting shot, please refrain from commenting on keeping 
things stock,
the virtues or detriments of going with electronic ignition, etc.  It's 
not my bus and
not my choice. :)  My friend is also aware that he'll need to change the 
jets on his
30 PICT-3 or go with a different carb to avoid burning out his engine, 
we're just
trying to go one step at a time.

thanks all, and have a great weekend!
