Dear List,

Pleases save my ass again!

I pulled the egine and did the following.
--replaced AMC head with burnt exhaust valve on #3 with an AVP
rebuild.
--Replaced rings on 3, 4.
--New pushrod tube seals.
--New oil pressure switch
--Some new fuel line
--New points, condensor
--New fuel filter
--Changed oil
--All new exhaust gaskets

Put engine back in.  Set points to 0.016&quot; with feeler gauge.  
Tryed to set timing statically.  Light came on when notch was
at 12 degrees ADTC.  Now is notch at 0 or is it at 5 BTDC?
Or in other words is my timing set at 17 degrees ATDC or 12 
ATDC?  I couldn't figure out what to undo to rotate 
distributor so I left it.  Undid 10mm thing but it would only
rotate 3-4degrees and this didn't affect anything. So I left it.
I adjusted the valves.  

I started it up and it sounds OK?  I have no idea what it should
sound like.  Took it for a test drive and it seemed like it was 
idling too fast or something?  In third it hesitated/bucked a 
couple times at 40mph. and did the same in 4th at 50-55 and 
didn't seem like it would go a whole lot faster if I had tried.
All in all I drove 2.5 miles and was a little concerned.  It 
smelled really hot when I got back and when I opened it up I 
could see some small amounts of burnt oil smoke coming from the
fan hub area.

Whats wrong with it?  The timing?  How can I fix it so I can 
drive it 250 miles tomorrow!?

Please help.  The faster the replies the better as I have to 
have this fixed yesterday!

THanks in advance.

Remember I've only had a VW two months and done very little 
mechanical work before then so the simpler you keep it the better.
