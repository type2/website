Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy firewall removal?

Hogan,

 From recent experience... If the vapor system is truly sealed including 
linking the lines that one hooked to the missing charcoal canister, 
you've got another problem developing. 

The day after I found and replaced all of the leaky hoses linking the 
lines (I already had linked the two canister hoses together as it was 
missing) I filled up and went on a small 15 mile trip.  10 miles down 
the line the engine started dying like the fuel pump quit.  About that 
time cylinder head temp started rising fast.

I pulled off the road and the engine idled smooth and temp started 
dropping.  As soon as I got back on the road it started dying again.

I did a lot of poking around but the figurative light came on when I 
pulled the gas cap and heard a whoosh-thunk as air sucked in and the gas 
tank popped back into shape.  I finished the trip with a vent line 
opened but loosely wrapped in case of fuel spillage.  The next day a 
charcoal can was found and installed.  No problem since.
