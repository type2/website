Subject: Fwd: [T2] Power for Timing Light?

Kevin: I always do just as you suggested.

For my '71, the 12V that appears on the coil is switched 12V. This 
means that it does pass through the ignition switch, as opposed to 
coming directly from battery + as it does with your jumper cables. 
There should be plenty of current available at the end of this trip 
to power any conceivable timing light.

By the way, why is your battery under the front passenger seat?
