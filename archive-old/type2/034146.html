Subject: Any one looking for dual carbs?

Hi Volks,
The subject says it all.  I have found a 70 Westy to fill my bus void
after the departure of Sparky, my ole '60 panel and need some $$$.  I
have a set of 45 mm Delortos with the manifold and linkage.  They sure
are pretty, only 800 miles on them.  If intersested please e-mail off
the list.  Thanks.

Joy thru air,
Jamie
