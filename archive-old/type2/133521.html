yes on the auto tranny they are different lengths on each side, the tranny
is slightly offset.  gotta get em back on the correct sides or you can
really mess up the tranny and certainly the CV's  in fact if you put the
short one on the long side it can completely pull free at full suspension
travel.  (with all the noise and damage you imagine)
