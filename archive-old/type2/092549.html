Does anyone else besides me think that this is the most ingenious solution 
ever?  McGyver, eat your heart out!

&gt;I too had a fuel pump failure on a long trip but had no spare, and no parts

&gt;the fuel tank breather (in the engine bay), and connecting the inlet and out
&gt;let hoses to the fuel pump together. Then it was a matter of putting a few
&gt;holes in the breather hose so the pressure didn't build up too much.
&gt;This worked a treat and kept us going for a few days (and ~200km) until we
&gt;could get an electric fuel pump!
&gt;Handy to remember if your stranded without a spare fuel pump and have a tyre
&gt;pump.
