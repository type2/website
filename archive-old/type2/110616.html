&gt; Say, does anybody know how the vote turned out on that CA Senate Bill, the
&gt; one that was going to kill the rolling exemption?

According to the amended bill shown here:

http://tinyurl_dot_com/b4gl

it appears that the language taking away the 30-year rolling exemption and
instituting a 45-year rolling exemptin has been deleted from the bill.

What remains is increased fines for non-compliance, an assistance
program for low-income persons, and expanded authority to establish
inspection checkpoints.

Frankly, inspection checkpoints don't please me at all, but since they
won't be big revenue producers for cities I doubt that they will be
instituted in any quantity.
