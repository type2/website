Subject: looking for information on 71 Westie that is oginal from
  France.
Mime-Version: 1.0

I just bought my first Bus. I was wondering if any one had some information 
on a 71 westie
for France. There are a few thing that are a little different for the 
others that I have seen
before. One thing is my bus does not have any back up lights, where the 
back up lights are normally that is where the blinkers are and there are no 
four way flashers. I was wondering if this is normal?

thanks Mike
