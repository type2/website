I notice in my most recent JC Whitney catalog # 627J (yeah, I know)
that they advertise the sound deadening panels that have been threaded
here on several occasions.
See page 152; their items 12LY5514A &amp; 13LY5544X
QUESTION&gt;&gt;&gt;
Is this the same stuff that has been talked about recently?

Also, someone once asked about my using the aluminum backed felt in the
engine compartment sandwiched with a sheet of aluminum as exterior
support and covering, replacing that black OEM cardboard,. 
Page 5-8 of this Whitney flyer states that it is fire retardant to some
spec # FMVSS 302; whatever the Hell that is all about !?

Someone also was asking about
6 VDC to 12 VDC converters and 
6 VDC/12 VDC &quot;positive&quot; ground to &quot;negative&quot; ground converters.
These are also advertised for sale in the flyer.
