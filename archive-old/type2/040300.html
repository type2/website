&gt; How would you adapt the VW half-shafts to the Subaru 5-speed?  I'm

&gt; half-shafts equal or unequal lengths?

Frankly, I don't know.  My subaru experience is rather dated.  If the ring
gear can't be flipped, then the point is moot anyway.  I would expect to
either use adapters between the subaru flanges and the VW cvs or perhaps
have special axles made with the Subaru CV on one end and the VW spline on
the other.  I'm pretty sure that special axles will be required anyway, as
the chance of their having the exact length required would be small.
 
&gt; How much re-engineering would it take to mount the Subaru transaxle in a
&gt; baywindow bus?

It's a question of size.  Subaru borrowed a lot of its design parameters
from the aircooled VWs.  Brackets can be fabricated fairly easily as long
as the transmission isn't larger than the VW unit.  the shift linkage
would be an adventure!

&gt; Where would the radiator live?

I've seen very clean conversions where the radiator lived in the left side
of the engine bay and was fed from the left air inlet only.  If
well-sealed, this arrangement seems to work well.  I've also seen
variations with the radiator in the rear hatch and under the bus between
the frame rails.
 
&gt; This is a _very_ interesting concept.  If a Porsche 911 6-cylinder and
&gt; transaxle can be fitted, there ought to be plenty of room for the Subie
&gt; bits.
&gt; 
&gt; Time to get out the mics and slipstick.....

I've toyed (and done nothing else) with this idea for years.  If the
subaru ring gear can be flopped I would be more likely to give it a try.
I think that hanging 150HP on a stock bus tranny is asking for trouble,
both in the transmission and in the engine from high revs.

It would seem a natural for those watercooled vanagons with blown engines
that can be had for a song!
