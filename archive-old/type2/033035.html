 [...]
&gt; The results:

 &gt; Six list members including David Schwarze, Karl von Salzen, Jamie Rivers,
 &gt; Michael Benthin, and Jim Densley, representing several hundred thousand
 &gt; miles on coil-over shocks answered that they had experienced no serious
 &gt; problems.  I myself have 33,000 trouble-free miles on my last pair of
Napa
 &gt; coil-overs.

 I am still happy with over 58,000 miles and 5 years on my Napa coil-overs.
 Still trouble-free.
