&gt; 1) Asbestos - There are two plastic type tubes that connect the heat
&gt; control box (device w/ flapper) to the tubing on the rest of the
&gt; vehicle.  I believe this plastic interface is designed to deal w/ the
&gt; motion of the engine.  However, since it is plastic and the heat
&gt; control box can get very hot, there is an insulating material attached 

Sure as shit is asbestos, looks like all the asbestos I've ever seen,
here's a clue leave it alone it will leave you the same way.  But if
you are terribly scared or if you destroy these seals as asbestos is
sort of hard to handle without crumbling, on the air cooled vanagons
they went to gorgeous red silicone seals instead.  Work a whole lot
better.  Should basically be a direct replacement if you can find them,
junker FI.  I wonder myself what is inside the rubber bellows, not
just what the seals are.
