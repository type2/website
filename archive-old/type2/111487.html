&gt; Can anyone tell me how I can find out which one's go to the transaxle &amp; which
&gt; one's
&gt; go to the wheel. I don't know what position they were in to begin with.

CV joints for buses are absolutely indifferent to position.  They can be
installed in any position or orientation with no ill effect.
