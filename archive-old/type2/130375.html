I probably have similar tools as yours (got them from a friend who had 
gotten rid of his Ghia and didn't want them cluttering up his garage 
:-)

&gt; Tach/Dwell meter it
&gt; has the two power leads witch I'm assuming goes to the battery for
&gt; power. Then it has another lead that goes to a aligator clip with a
&gt; little green rubber boot over it. Does this connect to the NEG on the
&gt; coil to sense grounding and thus RPMS? That's what I'm assuming it 
&gt; does.

My Sears tach/dwell meter has +12, ground, and a green lead that goes 
to coil NEG.
