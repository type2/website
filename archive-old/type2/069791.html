&gt;Sounds like you weren't at TDC for each cylinder when you adjusted it.
&gt;I've found that, although theoretically you can adjust a valve at any
&gt;point where it's fully closed...

I don't think this is exactly correct.  The valve must be closed AND the
lobe of the cam must not be touching the lifter.  If there is .008&quot; of
clearance at TDC, when the lobe begins to push the valve open that
clearance will be taken up before the valve begins to open.  If you
adjusted the valves at this point, they would be as much as .008&quot; too
loose.  At TDC this shouldn't be a problem because both valves have been
closed for a while.  Moral?  Know thy camshaft, brothers and sisters. :-)
