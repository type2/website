No cuss, Clark... :-)

I wrote much the same thing, with the addendum that the auto trans would
be a real bear to install in a '68-71 (which is what I think he is looking
for).  To install the auto trans, you need the torque converter drive
plate, which in the US only came for the T4 crank, so installation on a T1
engine is &quot;right out&quot;.  Maybe European models came with the T1 engine and
an auto trans... (anyone?)  is there a T1 auto trans drive plate?  would
an autostick drive plate work?  (I strongly doubt it!)
