Hi, folks--

I've got 80-some miles on the new engine from VW de Mexico.  Still looking
out of reflex at the gen/oil lights at stoplights--it's so quiet I keep
thinking it died.

Break-in is moving ahead on schedule and without surprises--many thanks to
everyone on the list who shared data and lore on that.  I'm sure that
there are Roman Catholic exorcisms that have fewer steps [and, perhaps,
ask for less to be taken on faith], but I want to coax every mile out of
this thing that's there to be gotten.

I ended up spending a little more on the process than I'd intended [hah!
big surprise there, huh?] because I also replaced a lot of stock stuff
that previous owner[s] had removed for whatever reason.  See above, re:
coaxing every mile out of it.

Also, I've got no complaints with the work done so far by Always V-Dub,
the guys who did the in-putting for me.  Fair prices, reasonable attitude,
and no [apparent] problem with having me watch the whole thing and borrow
the work light and point and ask questions. Stay tuned.

This evening, I did something I haven't done in quite awhile--took the bus
for a drive for the fun of it.  [A clapped-out engine is no fun, on a
whole lot of levels.]

Thanks again to the people who sent advice, and the people who keep this
list going.  I honestly can't imagine taking that bus on if I hadn't had
access to that base of knowledge and support. I'll be back with news after
the 300-mile check-out.

daring to be hopeful about this whole project,

Bill
