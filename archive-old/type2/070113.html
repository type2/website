My nominees are:

first, one I already have but dare not apply, as it
constitutes masochism on a level I have not yet reached:

- ------------
| BAD COP, |
| NO DONUT |
____________

second, one we had in a bookstore I used to work in that got the most
suprising (and variant) reactions:

- -------------------------
|  REMEMBER YOUR LEVEL  |

I would also like one based on a phrase I use all the time when someone
does something fatally stupid &quot;Think of it as 'chlorinating the gene
pool'&quot;.  Abridging it to something that would fit on a bumper sticker has,
however, defeated me.
