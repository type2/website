Subject: RE: [T2] Another Excellent Custom Canvas Vendor

Ron,

I see you chose just one of the two web pages I posted to debate the
products they purvey.

The PLF site I forwarded to the list last night is a real good place to
do business with , make a high quality item, are real nice folks , and
have a bunch more canvas items available than you have to offer.

I posted this as an answer to a request from another list member who
inquired about alternative sources for canvas.

I have a new standard weight, 3 window canvas from you--it isn't any
heavier--no better, no worse than the original fabric .

It for sure isn't any heavier material.

If I was to do it all again--I would have bought the Sunbrella.
A bit more expensive, a bit bulkier-but for the long haul it's 10 times
what the standard canvas is-- it's more water repellant, more UV
resistant, and will outlast the original equipment material --hands
down.

I've had 6 boats and have had canvas made in the Sunbrella material,
and is superior to any cotton canvas--not even a close contest.


Later,

            ______________
