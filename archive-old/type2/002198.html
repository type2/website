Subject: Re: [T2] Pull Knob Under the Front Seat

I believe the control will allow for a full application of the gasoline
heater switch and when it gets too hot inside the cable control will
regulate the amount of heat entering and still allow the heater to remain
running.

&gt; OK Folks.  Here's one for ya, and I know someone out there will have an
&gt; answer.  In my bus (1973 VW Camper Bus - Sufari) 1800cc Motor, there is a
&gt; black knob, similar to a choke knob that you would find on an old car.
You
&gt; can pull up on it, and it will pull on a cable.  I followed the tube that
&gt; this cable runs in and it ends somewhere in or near the gas tank area.
What
&gt; is this knob used for, and how does it work?  Was it an old choke
connection
&gt; to my carborator at one time, or does this serve a different purpose?
