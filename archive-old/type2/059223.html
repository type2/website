hey list - i'm looking for some hints to get my '78 running a little better in the morning...the FI has been replaced w/a weber progressive that loves these texas summers but bogs terribly when the temp dips below 50F. i've been played w/the choke to rich the mix during cold starts, but it's still pretty tough to get going. anyone have similiar problems/potential solutions?
