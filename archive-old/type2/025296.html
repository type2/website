&gt; The cold-start valve normally operates for only about the first 10
&gt; seconds after you start a cold engine.  You might have two sorts of
&gt; problems with the valve:

Alistair,
The cold start valve does not operate if the engine has been started.  It
will only operate with the starter cranking and then only when provided a
ground by the thermo-time switch.  Due to the thermo-time switch, it will
stop injecting fuel even if the starter is operating after a certain period
of time, usually around 10 seconds, to avoid flooding the engine and making
starting difficult.
