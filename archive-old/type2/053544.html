Subject: cam for solid lifters needed

Hello-

I'm in digest/lurk mode, but came upon a problem when I tore down the 
engine (1700) from my '73 bus.  The cam is badly worn on one of the 
lobes.  Does anyone have a solid lifter cam sitting around they part 
with cheap?  I want to get it running soon and can't afford a new 
one.
