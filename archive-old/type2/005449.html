Subject: reputable rebuilders


&gt;  So I've begun to look at rebuilt engines for sale.  I have
&gt; looked into GEX and AVP so far.  Does anyone have experience with these
&gt; companies? I would also like to get in touch with Strictly Foreign and
SIR.
&gt; Does anyone know how I could contact them?  Does anyone know any other
good
&gt; places to try?

Are the archives down???
This subject has been beaten to death!
Probably 50% of the archives deals with this. Try a search using &quot;GEX&quot;. You
may get a hit or 2....
