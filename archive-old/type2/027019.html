Hope this makes sense.  I went to change the transmission oil on my bus and 
noticed that the filling hole bolt was stripped(the head of the bolt where 
the allen key goes).  All the corners are very rounded out.  I’m afraid to 
try to hard to get it out in fear of stripping it so badly there is no 
chance of ever removing it.  luckily I didn't empty the oil first ;)

So:  any ideas on trying to remove it?

Also:  are replacement bolts available so I don’t have this problem in the 
future?
