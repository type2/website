Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Data Sticker?

From: &quot;Dave Horrigan&quot; &lt;dave_at_horrigania.karoo.co_dot_uk&gt;
&gt; What you have on there are car tyres, not light truck tyres as per VW's
spec.  I can't tell you what to do or not do with your own vehicle, but
these tyres will give you distinctly iffy handling in side winds / round
corners.

Kinda figured that they were car tires.  Thanks.

&gt; If the tyres are in good condition, maybe someone will do you a trade-in
deal or swap for used tyres of the correct type?

I can look into that.  With the amount of use we'll eventually put into G,
there's no question that he's going to need the right tires.  And I hadn't
considered the insurance angle.
