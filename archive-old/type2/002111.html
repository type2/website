Subject: Re: [T2] '74 wiring harness

&gt; That's great Bill, and my experience comes from having replaced a couple
of
&gt; these wiring looms on busses.  I am actually in agreement with you!  No
&gt; flame intended here.
&gt;
&gt; My post to the list was to try and help the guy figure out what he would
&gt; need to do to follow up on your idea, and make a new 72 loom work for his
&gt; 74.  I really feel sorry for him, what a hassel it is to not have the
&gt; correct parts needed to make/repair it right.

I have been a student of the wiring diagram from thom's  (fitzpatrick?)
link on the type2 tech notes. It's a brainbuster, but I'm trying to
basically see the diagram and the loom itself side by side in my mind. If
using the diagram, I recommend getting the translation table for the German
wire gauge (cm2 in cross sectional area) to American (AWG) to insure a
easier time replacing cables.

I like the idea of a homemade loom. No more too short lengths of wire,
change things if you want etc.  Also, who knows your bus better electrically
than you after such an ordeal, create your own electrical diagram. Pay me to
do it! Just kidding, sort of.

So no flame taken, none intended Bob, I know more about wiring than I do
about buses just yet, furthermore, I drive a 76 with 79 cal engine, so I
must digress to those of you who drive them.

Bill.
