&gt;&gt; Hi Folks, Earlier, Rawls Moore asked about what kind of oil everyone
uses.  Well I used to use straight weight oil, in an appropriate viscosity
for the season, until I found out what the second number in multigrade oils
stands for.  Evidently the second number is the qualities of the oil at 100
degrees C.  For instance 20W50 oil is a 20 weight oil at ambient
temperature, but at 100 degrees C has the same viscosity of a 50 weight
which is at 100 degrees C.  So, while the viscosity of a multi-grade oil
doesn't actually go up with temp., it doesn't go down as fast as a straight
weight oil.  This is achieved by the use of additives in the oil.  So now I
use a good quality, multi-grade oil appropriate for the expected seasonal
temperatures. &lt;&lt;

This is a sorta good way to look at it for protection's sake, but not really
accurate.  It's not about ambient temps, but operating temps.  But the
really important factor is that as your multi-vis crankcase oil degrades it
loses the properties of the higher viscosity number.  Even the previously
suggested HD low-sulfur diesel engine oil in a 15w-40 (for example) will
only have the viscous properties of straight 15w after as little as 1,500
miles.  You don't pay more for a multi vis (although you do for diesel
blends) but you don't gain anything either, imo.  Conversely your 30w oil
should maintain 30w properties up to 3,000 miles easily.  Regular oil
changes is the key in any case.  Owning an air-cooled VW should be a
spiritual, almost religious experience.  Every 3,000 miles you change the
oil, adjust the valves, achieve enlightenment...

John
