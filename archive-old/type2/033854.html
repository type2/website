Subject: Fire Extinguishers

    I feel that it is imperative to carry a fire extinguisher, especially in
our air-cooled cars.  It borders on irresponsible to navigate the potential
hazards that we do without taking the necessary precaution to ensure our
safety, our passenger's safety, and our vehicles safety.  I have witnessed a
few vehicle fires, many of which could have been prevented by taking a few
simple safety measures.
    Frank is right.  Buy a fire extinguisher for every vehicle, for the
kitchen, and the shop too. I had a problem with the carbs on my 911 and a
backfire caught a small pool of fuel on fire.  Without my extinguisher I
would have had a jet black, 6 carb, whale tailed pile of scrap.
    Put one on your wish list. While insurance can replace metal, it cannot
replace the time, effort, and blood we put into these vehicles.

    Ken, I know it may not have the most Bus content, but it can't be
stressed enough.
