When I was stationed in Italy about 6 years ago, I used gasoline for 
cleaning small parts - a pan, a brush, and about 50 feet from anything 
electrical or a source of flame. My roommate - smart guy that he was - 
walks over one day while I am cleaning parts (gas on my hands and sleeves) 
with a cigarette in his mouth. I ordered him to get the F*** away and he 
proceeds to stand there explaining that it is not the liquid fuel that is 
the danger but the fumes and THEN PROCEEDS TO THROW HIS CIG IN MY PAN! 
(sorry to shout). Yes there was only liquid in the pan but my hands, and 
clothes and the air around me was full of vapors....

I can say nothing that sums it up enough. DUH doesn't say enough....

Gas is up to you. I'll use it on a rare occasion but there are much better 
non-fire death source-alternatives.

Another short story. We used to burn our paper and cardboards in a 55 
gallon drum in the backyard in Italy. I tossed a pint of gas from a can on 
the barrel. It had been 3 days since the last time I burned anything in the 
barrel. I don't know why I thought I needed a gasoline start... Maybe it 
had rained. I had checked and there was no smoke and no heat. The gasoline 
flashed. I had recently been cleaning parts with gas and the flash ignited 
my right sleeve and hand. Amazingly the flame didn't cause pain at first as 
the fuel simply burned leaving my skin unharmed. However it didn't last....

Eventually the pain arrived (2 secs) and I ran to the faucet to water 
myself down. Surprise - water or not the flame didn't/wouldn't go out 
immediately. I did get it out but not before some blisters developed. It 
was all very minor damage but it scared me to death. What if a gallon of 
gas went up? The fact was I could not get it to go out right away and we 
are talking about fumes - not even the result of a splash.

Months later - I had learned my lesson - I went across town to help a 
friend start a stubborn carbed 3 series BMW. He gave it a couple of tries 
with little more than a stumble for a reward from the engine. I jumped in 
and pumped and pumped and got a little more response. I needed some ether 
spray. My friend (different one) produced a GALLON of gas in a bleach 
container. He started pouring gas into the carb and was rewarded by a 
backfire THROUGH THE CARB! It lit the carb, the top of the motor, and the 
gas can. Then it lit his shirt and clothes saturated with fumes I suppose. 
He dropped the gas and ran. The car was gridlocked in a storage yard 
outside an Italian friend's shop. The gas spread under about 5 other cars + 
the BMW. I ran into the shop and forgot my Italian - all of it. Fuoco is 
Italian for fire and I never knew how to ask for a fire extinguisher. I got 
help and the extinguisher. No damage to the cars - just alot of soot. My 
friend got pretty warm and blistered in several places. I drove him (him 
smiling sheepishly!) to the Naval hospital where he had to explain it all. 
They even gave me a Navy Achievement Medal for it... (don't get too 
impressed, it wasn't a big deal. I even played hooky during the ceremony 
where they were awarding medals for good behavior, years of services, 
etc... Definitely one of the best ways to piss off your Chief!)


Moral of the story?

I dunno... I forgot.

&gt; &gt; Gasoline is too volitile, but I have to admit to using it for small jobs.
&gt; &gt; Not a good thing, though.
&gt;
&gt;I have a friend... whom shall remain nameless.. who told me of how he
&gt;cleaned his chassis...
&gt;
&gt;He said he laid under the vehicle with a tub of gasoline, a scraper and a
&gt;rag and removed the years of accumulated gunk that way. He said he was
&gt;basically laying in a puddle of gas and covered with gas by teh time he
&gt;was done.
&gt;
&gt;I cringed, looked at him like he was an alien,  and told him he must have
&gt;a deathwish.  he told me he thinks its perfectly safe and when i
&gt;sugggested kerosene or paint thinner he pshawed me.  Oh well, maybe he
&gt;will have to learn the hard way, i hope not.
&gt;
&gt;Dont any of you follow his example, its a very very very bad idea... (one
&gt;teeny tiny spark and FOOM you are flambe` and dead on the spot or spending
&gt;all your time in a burn unit in excruciating pain until you are dead or
&gt;they patch you up.)
&gt;
&gt;take care,
&gt;
