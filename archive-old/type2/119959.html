&gt; library for the engine conversion article &quot;2.2 Subaru Engine in 1984 VW
&gt; Westfalia&quot; for a good start on the road.

Hmmm, Kennedy discourage use of the 2.2 Legacy engine in bays, citing a
clearance issue between the air inlet and gas tank.

I really didn't want to use the smaller 1.8 subaru engine, but if the 2.2
(or 2.5!) is viable this might be more attractive.

What are you doing to get around this supposed interference?
