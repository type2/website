Hi Mike,

The BN-4 has a plastic duct that pulls air from the left rear quarter 
panel, just below window height but above the 4&quot; mattress height. This 
duct fed air into the BN-4 which was located on the left side of the 
engine compartment. Ducting this air over to the booster fan is a mod 
I've contemplated, but since I don't drive the Westfakia during &quot;Salt 
Season&quot;, it hasn't been a big priority. I've been too busy camping in 
it!

The BA-6 warm air intake duct was located under the Z-Bed on the right 
side.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; I wonder exactly where those cutouts are... off to the Library...
&gt;
&gt; I'll look at a comple of different ways of getting cabin air to the
&gt; blower/cage.  The intake in that picture partially blocks a little bit 
&gt; of
&gt; the rear hatch opening.  There has to be a better place for it.
