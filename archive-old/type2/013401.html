Subject: Re: [T2] Removing steering wheel from 73, new question about smaller steering wheels

To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

There have been several posts lately about problems removing steering
wheels.  I must have been lucky in the two different Buses I've
removed steering wheels from.  After loosing the bolt I just pulled up
on the wheel and they came right off. (I'm not that strong either)

As anyone ever put a smaller diameter steering wheel on their Bus and
how has that affected the turning?  My 73 had junk Camaro seats (I
believe) in it when I got it and I just finished installing some nice
Honda seats.  These seats have the lumbar support in them so makes the
passage way between the driver's seat and steering wheel a little too
close.  If I could gain acouple of inches from a smaller wheel that
would be good but am wondering about the turning.  Should I start
lifting weights to be able to make tight turns or butt exercises for a
smaller butt?

Any thoughts on smaller steering wheels would be appreciated.
