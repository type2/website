only time something took longer than they told me it was the shipping
company that sent it to the wrong address.

&gt; You folks that have order parts from Bus Depot; How long does it usually
&gt; take to have an order completed?  I ordered 11 items on or around 17 Sept 01
&gt; and as of today I've only received 3 of the items.  I had to call to get the
&gt; magazine sent ahead.  I was told then the order should be completed in 2
&gt; weeks, well that was 3 weeks ago.  During that time the Jackpoint came in.
&gt; Is this normal?  I'm starting to think the savings isn't worth the wait.  A

my experience is that it is highly abnormal.

?? were the products in stock??
   were the products avaliable from their sources??
   were they keeping you informed??

any company can have problems, what they do then seperates the companies I
continue to do business with and those that I don't

Bus Depot is well above average in my book, and I doubt there are many
folks I haven't tried to get parts from in the past 35 years of owning
VW's
