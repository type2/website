&gt;I installed the new starter, and now my engine will turn over, but not

&gt;The plastic is split from one end to the other, the fuses aren't exactly
&gt;tight. The 3rd fuse holder looks like it has melted before. I ran to the
&gt;junkyard, and they only had a '69 with 10 fuses, instead of a '70 with 12
&gt;fuses. Anyone know where I can locate a fusebox for a '70. Or is there
&gt;anyway to replace it with something better? I'm searching the archives
&gt;tonight, but so far no luck.

Jeff,
I have a '70 fuse box you can have, but it is not in the best of shape, 
although it is useable.
What I found out is.............
There were two types of fuse boxes used in the '70's.
One was made out of a white plastic ............. Good
The other uses a more yellow plastic ........ Bad; becomes brittle with age.

What I have in my two '70's now is the white, and I still have a &quot;yellow&quot; 
one I removed from Casper.
I also have the support frame that the fuse block is mounted in.
Epoxy and some ingenuity might get you by with what I have here in stores.

Lemme know!
