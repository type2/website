Subject: Re: [T2] Mix in gas tank

&lt;&lt;  I was wondering if this mix 20 liters plus 40 liters of regular gas could 
make
&gt; some damage to the engine or just some smoke.
&gt; Any advice will be highly appreciate, I don not planning to do this as a
&gt; regular basis but we are passing through a hard times

I would think that little bit of oil would probably not hurt an engine, 

Bob &gt;&gt;

&quot;Probably&quot; not...Just keep an eye on the plugs and keep 'em clean.
Too much oil will lead to fouling and carbon build-up in the cylinders.
You wouldn't want to end up &quot;de-coking&quot; the cylinders (Ancient Brit-
ish Religious Ceremony ;-)
