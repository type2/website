I have a 72 westy camper, and its being stubern to say the liest, i took
it to a repair shop in northern wisconsin to have the valves adjusted,
and to &quot;fix the idle and set the timeing&quot; which they did, and it idled
fine for a few weeks. they simply rewired most of the engine, they
dident put the wire to the vacume advance cut off, is that why it
backfires a little when i rev it? also it always backfires once, very
loud. the thread on the electromagnetic cutoff on my right carborater is
stripped and it dosent stay in to well, well i think it's stripped, it
just dosent stay in well, if you touch it, it'll fall down and when that
happens it seams to gradualy loose power, until i cant get it above 35
(that happend a few times on the highway. i guess my questions are....

Will the cutoff prevent it from idleing? it used to, just fine but its
got progressively worse?

Do i need to have the carb rebuilt?
