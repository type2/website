Subject: Re: [T2] Valve Adjustment screw size for 2L

on 9/16/03 09:30, Snoopy related:

&gt; Does anyone know the size of the valve adjusting screw for a 2L? I just
&gt; received a set from a vendor that were 10MM  and they are way too big!!!  I
&gt; need to know the correct size so I have the info in hand when calling..
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Snoopy

there are two sizes for adjusting screws - 10mm and 8mm. most 2l motors are
10mm, but it is possible to have a stock 2l with 8mm screws.
