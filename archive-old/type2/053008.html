Gentlepersons-
                       Years ago my Sprite broke down (surprise!), and as I 
was trudging up
the highway, a car with a bunch of high school girls stopped and offered me a 
lift to
the next gas station. After I got in, about a half mile down the road another 
car pulled
along side, beeped,  the driver waved a badge and signaled the driver to pull 
over. It was an off duty cop and he ordered me out of the car. He then told 
the girls to take
off. I asked him what the problem was, and he said that I might be okay, and 
the next
ten hitchers might be okay too, but what about the one that isn't? He said he 
didn't
want them getting into the habit of helping strangers.
                      He didn't offer a rideto the gas station either...
