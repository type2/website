Just to add to your headache...  6v-12v converters do exist.  I've had 'em in
my hand.  Of course that was fifteen or twenty years ago...  If you do decide
to do the conversion, the only real PIA is the wiper motor.  There are a
couple of different ways to solve the problem.  One is to find the rare and
elusive '67 motor and linkages and swap out the whole assembly.  The other is
to have your 6v motor rewound to 12v.  Voltage dropping resistors aren't
really a satisfactory solution. (BTDT)  Everything else is relatively simple. 
New coil, the $99 atlernator conversion, bulbs etc.  The starter motor lives
just fine as long as one remembers that it is a 6v unit and doesn't grind on
it for minutes at a time.  

Now if you want to look for a converter that's REALLY hard to find, try to
find a 12v positive ground to 12v negative ground converter for your old Britcar.

&gt; *DO* want to run a 12v stereo someplace in the bus including a homemade mpeg
&gt; player that will necessitate using a power invertor.  I think that really
&gt; sinches the decision to convert over.  I can't imagine the hell it would
&gt; cause trying to get a power invertor for 6v - I bet they don't even exist.
