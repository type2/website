&gt; Im just gonna have to go get dirty tommorrow and see

&gt; right and left terminals

I am trying to find a photo... Meanwhile, here's the
scenario: You can make a simple short wire adapter for
your 2-terminal starter, but since I no longer have
one and it's been many years since I did it, I simply
can't tell you what's what. I'll get back to you
shortly. -BaH
