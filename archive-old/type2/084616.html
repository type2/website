All things are possible. Measure the advance at idle and several RPM's up=20
to 3000.  Right down the measures. Plot the data on a chart. Degrees of=20

curve for your existing dizzy. Skip the chart and just compare data given=20
in Bentley for your stock dizzy, or any other dizzy. If the data or chart=20
matches within 2=B0 throughout, it should work very well with all other=20

As the Webers are not stock, you must do several very specific tests along=

Any savy mechanic can measure the vacuum ports on the carbs to deterime=20

Your mechanic doesn't have to be an engineer, but he sure will have=20
