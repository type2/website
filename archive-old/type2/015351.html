For Part I see &quot;DM: Dead Dynosaurs in the form of carbon&quot;
For Part II see &quot;DM: Dead Dynos II&quot;
For Part III see &quot;DM: Dead Dynos III&quot; 


So, I spent the rest of the day scraping and chipping the offensive
residues of ancient animule meat all outta there, buttoned it all up, took
a test ride, and had full throttle motoring once again with no problems.
And no more foam due to the Valvoline 20/50 racing oil now in the sump.

At about 45k, during regular inspection, it was evident that the valve
guides were worn beyond spec so I pulled the heads for replacement. With
the multi-weight low vis low carbon base oil in play for the next 20k I had
very little buildup to address. Empirative evidence suggesting a proven
theory of more carbon in higher weight strait grade Dead Dynosaur elixers.

When I sold das maschine at 65k, the pinging problem had not returned
despite the much reduced quality of the Brontosaurous Pee in the form of no
lead low octane gas available at that time, without reducing compression
ratio, without octane addatives, without any compromise of the original
design. I had new spec compression, not enough carbon to stifle a yawn, and
due to no compromise inspection procedures, the insides of the motor were
as clean as the day it was assembled at the factory. No varnish AT ALL
ANYWHERE. Can you say &quot;RESULTS&quot;????  

(THE END, not to be continued, that's all she wrote)

&gt;&gt;The carbon deposit buildup that one seems are more likely gummy tars from
&gt;&gt;longer molecules created in the combustion process.  That's why stuff like
&gt;&gt;Marvel Mystery oil is popular...it's a solvent that removes that crap
&gt;&gt;(or at
&gt;&gt;least claims to).

The tar and varnish residues are a mixture of carbon and tenacious
volatiles. When the volatiles are all evaporated, only carbon remains. Once
all the volatiles are gone, nothing but the most agressive acids can do a
thing about it. Solvents can only penetrate effectively the tars which
still have volitiles present for the solvent to penetrate. 

I've tried every possable solvent I could identify to make carbon removal
an easier task than hand/tool removal. Most of them claim to dissolve
carbon. My experiance proves to me this is a facade. I'll be chipping the
carbon out of a Mercedes 300D in the next week or two. It comes from the
heavier carbon load of the higher carbon content in the diesel fuel, as
compared with the lighter carbon content of the Panther Pee now being sold
as gasoline. 

Then there is always the Harley riders trick for removing the recurring
short range carbon build up from using 60 weight oil. Rev the motor under
no load to 2500 rpm whilst using an atomizer to spray water in the intake.
The water turns to steam in the combustion process and blasts the carbon to
be blown out the valves. Would it be prudent for me to try this on my
clients $5000 replacement cost motor???? Would I try this tech on any of my
DM maschines?
Answer-I can't find this procedure in the factory manuals, ergo, no, I will
not.
