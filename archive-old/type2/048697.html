Subject: [T2] 69 bus w/ no spark sometimes.....

Hey again
    Me again.
    Different bus, different problem.
    My daily driver 69  (when it's not this cold) is a 69 1600 SP motor with 
a 009 dizzy. 
     About 2 months ago I replaced points, rotor, plug wires, condenser. 
Drove fine for about a week or so, then died while driving. Tests revealed 
that I had no spark coming from coil.  Replaced coil w/ known good one (took 
it off my functional bug) and still had no spark. Tested ignition lead- have 
12V to coil when key is on. Checked lead from condenser to (--) side of coil 
- found juice there whether points are open, closed, etc. 
     My theory then was that the new condenser may be shorted out. Got 
another condenser, ran for a few days, then lost spark again. Only this time 
after the bus sat for a little while, I somehow got spark back without 
touching a thing.  To make a long story short- this has happened several 
times now. I drive, lose spark, check basics, but really do nothing, then 
suddenly bus will start and run again for a little while until it decides 
that it will lose spark again. 
    I have tried another coil- making it 3 - no change. 
     I have rechecked points with feeler again. I made sure condenser 
mounting surface is clean. I made sure all connections are good, replaced 
most connectors too. 
    The only consistent things is that when I have no spark, there is:
    1) Always 12V to coil when key is on
    2) Always power on other side of coil too.  (Test light glows on both 
sides of coil)

    When I do have spark, bus runs really well. No misses. No stumbles. 
   Any ideas?   
  
   Sign me
   (beating head against wall- probably something stupid that I am missing)
