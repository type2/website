Subject: &lt;Sigh&gt; I love My Bus

At least I keep telling myself that. I've been trying to take advantage of the warm (for January) weather here in Virginia to knock out some of my bus projects. One is to replace the widow seal and quarter window on the left rear side. The quarter window on my bus was toast, the entire bottom of the frame was eaten away with rust-oddly enough the rubber seal is in excellent condition. Last junk yard run i found a perfectly good quarter window-and, oddly enough, it's seal was trash! No problem I thought, just swap seals. Well, when I took the old quarter window out, the post that goes through the window frame on the bottom was gone-eaten away. However, when I removed the glass from my junkyard window frame, that post snapped off-ARRRRGGGHHHH! I still have the piece, and I'm maybe going to try some JB Weld, but I'm not too hopeful that that will hold-and I'll probably end up back at the junkyard looking for another quarter window. Anyone ever had this situation and have any luck fixing it?       Jeff
