The &quot;SERVICE ENGINE SOON&quot; light comes on and it runs very rough.  It's =
pretty sad for a brand new car.  This is the first  American car we've =
ever bought.  We also had the ignition coil go out 3 days after we =
bought it(thank god for cellular phones &amp; AAA):(.  Even though we've had =
all these problems we love the car.  It has all the space we need for =
our family.  One friend of mine who has a 95 astro had their van =
repainted buy Chevy, the factory didn't paint it properly.  They also =
love their van despite this.
