Volks,

The answer is: home :-)  I am currently sorting thru a couple *thousand*
e-mails from the list over the past month (we *are* a wordy bunch! :-).  I
am also preparing a rather huge trip report.  Rather than post, I will be
putting it up at:

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/

pretty short at the moment, but it will expand, I promise :-)  

The gist of the whole trip can be summed up in the events of the last two
days, however.  I rushed the final legs of the trip to be back for the
wedding of a friend.  I had learned while on the road that he was getting
married on the third in Baltimore, MD, and I dead flat had to be there!  
When I arrived, one of the groomsmen, my adoptive brother, informed me
that there was a funeral related event the next day in next day in New
Jersey.  So I went straight from a terrific high to a flat low on
consecutive days. Pretty much sums up the trip.  Details will follow.
