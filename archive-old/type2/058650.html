Subject: Hot rear brake drums

I have a choice on my 79 to adjust up the brakes hard then back off a little
until I get negligible drag, or back right off until there is no drag at all. 

The first option gets good braking but they run very hot, the second gives
very poor brakes inc. lousy handbrake but they stay cool. 

I took it to a garage and they reckoned the hot brakes are nothing to worry
about. I can't accept this - OK if I was doing a lot of stopping but not
constantly.

The wheel cylinders, hoses, brake linings, wheel bearings are all recent. I
had the drums measured for ovality and they were in spec. I suppose there
must be a tiny bit of ovality since when I adjust up the brakes there is a
decreasing amount of drag and at one point you can hear it is catching at
only one tiny point, but I'd expect that within a few miles this spot would
wear away and there would be no drag at all. This doesn't happen.

My assumption is that the hydraulic fluid is not releasing after braking and
the brakes are sticking on, and this points to the master cylinder or the
compensating valve. I have adjusted the free play between pedal and cylinder. 

Before I pull the master cylinder, is there anything else to check, and if
it is the master cylinder does it make sense to replace it or is it worth
just cleaning it out - I'm assuming if anything that I'll find some
passageway partially blocked. I've been spending far too much on this van
lately so I'm keem not to pay out for more stuff which won't fix the problem.

Thanks for any help
