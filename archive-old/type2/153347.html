Subject: condensor information, 

I have a bunch of condensors here,, they don't have any markings on them ,, 
other than some say, Made in Germany,, some say Made in USA,,, and some say 
nothing at all..
Other than they all have round plugs for the points connection....  I have 
no way to identify them
Does that indicate they are for the  distributors where the connection came 
in the bottom instead of the side?

I measured 20 or so with a capacitor meter... most measure about 220 micro 
farads.
One was 350 micro farad.. and one was around 800 microfarad

I am guessing these fit 70's volkswagens

Does anyone have information on a good spec for a condensor.

Does anyone check a condensor,, or are they just replaced at the same time 
as points?

I was told by a few of my mentors... if the condensor says Germany on it.. 
don't change it as a tune up part.
