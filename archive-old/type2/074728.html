Subject: Re: [T2] Searching archives for thread &quot;1600 into a 74 bus&quot;

Having driven a 40 HP Type I engine in a 3.88 geared Super Beetle... I 
would spend your time and money and stay with a Type IV. About once a year 
or so I have a chance to buy or pickup a giveaway Type IV core engine.

The Super would cruise but had NO power on the hills - geared too high. 
Think a stock VW (Beetle or Bus) is slow - try it with the wrong gear 
ratios.....

It's not hard to rebuild a Type IV and keep a spare Type IV sitting around.

Much harder to build a higher HP Type I that will last. I can do one or the 
other but not both - higher HP or decent durability. Don't have the skills 
or $$$ to build both. So... I stick with stock or very mild Type IV motors.

Ciao!
