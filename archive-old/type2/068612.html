Subject: Re: How are flywheels measured (Was 'looking for 228mm flywheel')

&gt;   Are there diff. Bus starters?

Yes, or so I was told by KEP. They said that if I wanted to swap
bellhousings (to accomodate the 228 flywheel and KEP's 9&quot; clutch), I would
also need a different starter: '75 and earlier starters will not work on
'76 or later bus/vanagon bellhousings. 

On the other hand, the old '75 starter and bellhousing would be fine if
I installed KEP's 200mm clutch kit.
