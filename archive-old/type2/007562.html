HI VOLKS!
In response to Simon's dilemma of choosing a bus or a truck I just have one thing to say: Buy a vw! I'm a 18 year old girl from MA and everyone thought I was insane to buy mine. They said I wouldn't be able to drive it or fix it and it wouldn't be reliable. Well, I've had it a year and I'm doing fine. Sure it has its idiosyncracies, but that is mostly the fault of the previous owner. The idiot guide and fellow vw nuts have been a real help. If you really love the vw, go for it, but just realize the work ahead that you may have.Be sure to check all mechanical aspects before buying and maybe have a more experienced vw nut look at it too. They're great to own and you'll never regret it if you buy one.Good luck!
