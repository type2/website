Subject: Re: [T2] Input Shaft

&gt;Ooops. It's 5:00 AM in CA, and I just woke up from a sound sleep and
&gt;realized I forgot to grease the tranny input shaft splines before putting
&gt;the engine/tranny back in last night. I don't think the clutch disk actually
&gt;travels back and forth on the shaft during operation.._dot_can I get away with
&gt;this? I'd hate to have to rally my crew to R&amp;R the engine again....

Could you drill a small hole in the side of the bellhousing and squirt 
liquid grease through it onto the shaft?
