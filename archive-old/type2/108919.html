Subject: Re: [T2] Rubber 

From: &quot;Scott Soehlig&quot; &lt;ssoehlig_at_gfd_dot_com&gt;
&gt; A unique combination of silicone and oil which lubricates, protects and
leaves surfaces coated with a never dry residual film. Forms a thin flexible
film that seals out moisture and corrosion. Restores body, moisture and life
to dried out rubber surfaces. Lengthens the life of weather stripping and
seals.

I can get silicone oil for storing/rejuvenating my RTV silicone molds, but
the description above sounds more like Armor-All.  Is so?

I wonder how well the silicone oil would work...

Might be worth ordering some just to try it out.  Might end up with
something worth selling at bus meets.
