Subject: Re: [T2] CHT readings

In the interest of getting it right.....

What needs to be expanded on here is the definition of a &quot;high quality 
switch&quot;.  Temperature measurement by thermocouple requires a VERY specific 
type of switch in order to work and remain accurate.  If a typical very low 
on resistance &quot;high quality switch&quot; is used, the gauge will read a value 
that is in error by the amount of ambient temperature where the switch is 
located.

The CHT meters use thermocouple wire which is what generates the voltage 
that the meter uses.  Thermocouple wire is a pair of wires made of two 
dissimilar metals.  For instance, one wire being iron and the other 
constantan.  The two wires are brought together at the point of temperature 
measurement (cylinder head) and the dissimilar metals generate a millivolt 
level that is directly proportional to  temperature.   When you put those 
wires onto switch terminals, you are creating yet another dissimilar metal 
junction and an offset voltage (error) is generated either adding or 
subtracting from the correct voltage.

Believe me, I have tried.  The resultant mess is not worth 
it.  (hmm...  meter says 400, I think it feels like 72 outside, ok hmmm... 
400 - 72, is.... darn, I just missed my exit.  Oh well.... ok 400 - 72 is 
300, borrow, borrow, well heck with exact, its about 325.  OK, on to the 
next cylinder, you have three more to do)

I have designed and built a board which will take the inputs from four 
thermocouples, correct for any errors (temperature compensation) and then 
ship the four temperatures out over RS-485 to a waiting PC on the other 
end.  Works real nice.  I have it connected to IR thermocouples to measure 
the temperature of a car body while the paint is being cured.

For lots of information on temperature measurement and what is needed to 
work with it go to
http://www.omega_dot_com

They do make a four position switch that will allow you to select one of 
four CHT sensors, but its not cheap and its not small.  (one nice aside is 
that it is bound to generate comments from the passengers and you could 
always claim that its the ejection seat control for bothersome 
passengers).  You can check it out at
http://www.omega_dot_com/toc_asp/frameset.html?book=Temperature&amp;file=OSW_SW14
looks like you can get a 2 pole, four position switch for $99.  If you 
really want to go &quot;wild&quot; they have the same switch but in a 5&quot; rather than 
3&quot; size.  That should get you some comments.

Hope that helps

If you use good wire and a high quality switch, I can see no reason that
it would not work.  Might take a few seconds for the gauge to settle down
to the new temp after you switch it.

 &gt; I have an idea.
 &gt; Question: Can I get three more sensors, wire them to a 4-position 
switch, wire
 &gt; that to the gauge and be able to toggle between the readings on all 4 
cylinders?
 &gt;
 &gt; I assume I can, but I would like to know if its possible and if anyone 
has done it.
