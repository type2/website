You *do* have to remove the dash to fix the antenna. I have it on very

&gt; Hi Oh All Knowing Ones
&gt; Thanks for advise with regard to rear visibility from inside rear view
&gt; mirror but I still dont know how to remove it from my 83 Vanagon air
&gt; cooled! I want to add a spacer or repace the mirror so that I can see
&gt; something to the rear other than the road. It appears to be permanently
&gt; fastened somehow. no screws in sight. Also te antenna is loose and there
&gt; does not seem to be any access to tighten it from the inside other than
&gt; removing the whole inst. panel.
&gt; Please help Oh All Knowing Listees
&gt; Thanks, Jack.
