Subject: Time for engine work

To the list,

I'm just about ready to have the engine work on my 71 Westy done.
From what I have been get from the list it a good idea to go back to the Vac. 
distributor and dump 00.9. 
Also the generator needs to be replace the key is going.  Though I should 
with the alternator kit for better charging, is this a good idea?

Now for the big one the engine has some were around 60+K on it and smokes at 
start up if setting for a day or two.  
So, time for new heads or at lest some work should be done.  I would like to 
get more power for the hills and freeway I was use to driving a 72 Westy with 
an 1800cc so the 1600cc is just a little slow. This not say that I run at 
80mph, 70mph is plenty fast for the bus. 

The question is can we go up in size with new cylinder and piston and still 
get a strong and reliable engine that will run cool and stay together?
