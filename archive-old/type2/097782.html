Subject: Bus body is rusted badly/considering getting a new body.

Hey all,

I have planned on restoring my 74 westy for some time now, and finally have 
had enough time lately to get to it.

I bought a rubber kit, pulled the windows and interior, and all of the 
interior panels. It's down to the body, wheels, engine, and dashboard..

Well, I went to start banging all the rust away, and man, there is a lot more 
than I had intentionally thought. The top end of the van is great, but as 
usual the bottom end is rusting in huge amounts. I will need to have like 6 
or 7 replacement panels welded in. I have never welded before, and I imagine 
paying someone to do it is going to be outrageously expensive.

I might just go ahead and try and find a clean 73-79 body that I can use 
instead, just not sure at this point. The only thing that I am sure of is 
that I am disapointed......but not discouraged.

Chris
74 Westy.
