Subject: VW-JUMPY DIZZY DWELL IN A NEAR NEW .009
Date: Sat, 24 Oct 98 13:00:28 PDT
From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

Why?  The distributor (a .009 Bosch centrifugal advance) is perhaps two
months old with maybe 750 miles on it.  I've been feeling some strange
things while driving and so I hooked up the dwell meter and watched it sit
at the correct 50 degrees and then drop to 40 and then to 45 and then back
to 50 for a while, then flirts with 45 again, etc.  The timing light
confirms this isn't a meter problem since I can see my 7 1/2 BTDC mark
jump around also.  The machine starts OK but you can hear when this is
happening by slight changes in RPM.

I'm assuming that the prblem is somehow related to the advance mech since
it only jumps to a lower dwell reading (though correct me if I'm wrong).  I
also thought there might be an issue with the coil or condenser if there
were micro-glitches in the ignition system that prevented the circuit
from closing (or opening) only occasionally which might appear to a dwell
meter as an advance (or something like that).

Anyway, any suggestions?  I'd rather not buy an new $90 dizzy if it isn't
absolutely needed.  I've seen chatter about jumping dwell in the past but
never paid much attention to it.  Seems to me that they discussed problems
with timing gears and the like.  Yuk.

Get my money back or exchange it?  Ha!  You've obviously never dealt with
United Autoparts in North Hollywood, AKA the &quot;VW Parts Nazis&quot;.


Thanks,


Nick
