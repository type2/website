&gt;While driving the freeway to work this morning, the brake

&gt;Got to work ok, opened up Muir's book to find nothing
&gt;regarding this problem (he mentions the warning light
&gt;coming on while braking), any ideas?

I think the light is supposed to come on if one &quot;side&quot; of the master
cylinder (front brakes or rear brakes) has pressure and the other doesn't.
This would indicate that there's a leak in the low pressure side.  The light
is connected to two three-prong switches that screw into the master cylinder.
Besides the aforementioned condition, other possible causes could be one of
the switches is bad, or the connections are corroded (very likely).  Note
that if you unscrew one of the switches you have to bleed the brakes.  Check
the connections first.  Bentley and Haynes both have a description of the
circuit and a wiring diagram.
