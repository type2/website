FWIW dept, I started using synthetics in my 71 van back in 1975 when Mobil
1 first came out, haven't looked back yet, in all of my motor vehicles
since then including a Mercedes and an Audi I have run only synthetics and
have not had a single oil related failure, the Mercedes had 584k on an
unrebuilt gas engine when sold, I have over the years been going to other
synthetic &quot;stuff&quot; as it becomes avaliable.  my current 78 has 100%
synthetic &quot;fluids&quot; in it since I switched to synthetic brake fluid about 2
years ago.   YMMV of course but I have yet to detect anything made worse
by the fluids in her.....

&gt; &gt; How about the Valvoline gear oil that is rated for service GL4, 5, 6? I
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; seen this stuff at several FLAPS; in fact it's just about all I can find,
&gt; &gt; even at NAPA.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Dave

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know specifically about Mobil 1 but Redline synthetic has a GL
&gt; &gt; &gt; rating.  The thing to avoid about GL5 for VW's is the corrosive effect
&gt; GL5
&gt; &gt; &gt; has on the brass/bronze components in our differential.  Hope that
&gt; helps.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Looked all over and can't find local supplier of GL4, even napa says
&gt; NO.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did find a supplier of Mobil 1 synthetic transmission gear oil. Is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this stuff ok in my 75 bus tranny or does it do the same bad things as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dino GL5.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks
