wonder if it is a Weld-Pak 100 with some pretty graphics for Home Depot,
what's the price and what's included??

I have teh Weld-Pak 100 along with the gas setup. it has served me well on
my Bus. will do anything I've asked it to do and seems to have pretty good
control for an inexpensive welder.  wouldn't want to use it in production
work, have had to stop once or twice to let it cool down but nothing
serious.   think I paid around $250 or so for it +the gas setup etc. was
close to $500 in the garage welding.
