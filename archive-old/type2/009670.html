There is absolutely no reason, even monitary, that should induce you
to put yourself through the torture that a Brazilian muffler will
give.  While there may be good mufflers from Brazil (VW do Brasil
wouldn't buy such bad ones, would they?) I haven't seen them in the
US.  Cheap tends to push out good.  The additional $30 or so that you
pay for the Liestirtz muffler will be repaid in the parts you _don't_
break while trying to bend things around to fit the new muffler.  If
you have to, patch the old one with muffler bandage until you have the
coin for the good muffler.
