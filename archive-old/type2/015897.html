Jen,

&gt; where are the best  SD junkyards w/ VW's???????  
I too have had good luck with Interstate VW, but they are more
expensive than they should be. If you know what you are looking
for and can identify whether or not the item in question is
worht buying, Ecology has the best prices. On the other hand, if
you are on a trip out of state and have the time, things are
less expensive out in the boonies. I found a place once in 
Moab Utah that had lots of stuff and very low prices.

Bob
