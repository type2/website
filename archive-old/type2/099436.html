Subject: Re: [T2] Reliable Garage In LA

&gt;Obliviously, from my last email I need a new starter for my brothers 78
&gt;Campermoblie.  However, the camper is down in LA with my brother.  I would
&gt;do it if it was up here, however he can not.  Can someone give me the name
&gt;of a good garage for air cooleds in LA?  Someone that can handle electrical
&gt;problems?

If it just needs a starter then the expert I would use is YOU.

The starter is held on by 2 bolts, it has maybe 3 wires.

Procedure:

Acquire replacement.
Remove old wires, 2 old bolts, remove starter.
Install new starter, replace wires in same position, replace 2 bolts.

Done.

Save yourself the money!!!
