Subject: swiss rosd trippers

The intrepid Swiss explorers made it to Olympia, WA last night.  Really nice guys, with 2 sweet husky dogs in their avocado green/white 79 westy with a bunch of stuff on the roof rack.  They'll be heading north from here, sounded interested in seeing the orcas and San Juan Islands, visiting Diane in Vancouver, B.C., and finding out about ferrys up to Alaska.
