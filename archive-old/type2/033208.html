Subject: AVP Engine Owners

After reading the archives it seams as if AVP is the most logical choice to
go with.I need a engine for my 72 westy, throne rod. I mailed several owners
in the archives and kept receiving bad addresses.
So can you please give me the usual run down on your engine. Has it been
good, what problems if any...etc.
How did it come to your house, a big truck? Did you have problems unloading
it?
What if any thing where you missing from the swap of engine parts?
Is it worth the extra $40. to go with the 1800 instead of the 1700?
Thanks for any advice, but mostly thank you for your time in helping me with
the purchase decision.
