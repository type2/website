&gt; &gt; The voltage (and therefore the power) delivered by the spark

&gt; That would imply that one could have bigger spark plug gaps than
&gt; recommended for better ignition. It would burn up the distributor

&gt;

&gt; thorough cleaning?

Bigger spark gaps do indeed give better ignition, but the gaps have to
be narrow enough to ensure that a spark will jump the gap in the
worst-case situation (low voltage, points at limit of adjustment, full
moon, etc).  Put in an ignition capable of more voltage reliably, and
you can increase your spark gap.

I doubt that the plugs need adjustment, but they might be worn or
dirty.  Pull one out for a look-see!
