*don't try this at home* We once transported a 55 gal. drum ( what's that
about 8.35 lbs. per gallon + the weight of the drum) of surfboard resin to
the tip of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico( for my son's surf shop),
in a 69 camper bus.  We were amazed that it ( 55 gal. drum) just fit through
the side slider.  We also had another few hundred pounds of other equipment,
and at least  a couple hundred pounds on the roof rack, two people, and a
type 1 longblock on board. I am sure we were way, way, way, over loaded.  We
had 15&quot; wheels in the rear* KYB* gas adjust shocks, powered by a 1776 DP. On
all the turns the front end  really wanted to break loose.  We made this
adventurous trip (1100 miles) on one of the most exciting two lane roads in
the world, in two days.

I am pretty sure the trany weighs about 70 lbs. I have shipped a few, and,
that's what *UPS* weighed it in at, including a heavy duty cardboard box.

I would guess the type 4 engine to be over 300 lbs.

Excuse the story, I know it's not Friday..    Just thought you might like to
know about some of my experiences in an overloaded type 2..........

&gt; Does anyone know the approximate weight of a
&gt; type IV engine, and also the weight of a 77' trans.
&gt;
&gt; I am looking to transport these pieces with a few
&gt; buddies and am trying to figure out if its under
&gt; the payload limits for my bus. ;)
&gt;
&gt; thanks
&gt; Alex,
