Subject: Part # for front beam seals

Listees, I beg a favor:

I need a part number for the seal that goes between the front beam tubes
and the trailing arms, for a '72.  Nobody seems to carry these except
for the dealership, and they won't look it up -- &quot;you gotta come down
here and point to it on the microfiche&quot; he sez.  Fortunately, they can
have the part by the next day (supposedly). But I'd much rather give him
a part number and let him confirm availability.  So, if anyone has a
parts book or 'fiche and can check the part number for me, I'd sure
appreciate it!

Thanks,


-chad
