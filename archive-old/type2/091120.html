Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling Plug Wires

I pull the wire at the distributor. It's easier to get to plus (as an
answer to your 2nd question) by pulling it from the source of the
spark that wire is no longer &quot;live&quot;. That way you shouldn't get
shocked. But don't put your finger where you pulled the wire from, I
suspect that you would make a great path to ground.

&gt; I've read a lot of posts that say to remove the plug wires one at a time
&gt; while the engine is running to see if any one wire makes a difference in the

&gt; end? Somewhere else I'm not aware of? And what do you use to insulate
&gt; yourself from the 'bite'?
