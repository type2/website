&gt; Maybe I'm wrong, but 1,500 miles a year as a day trip
&gt; truck??  Gag!  I feel sad for the van, to be relegated as a day
&gt; tripper...I have much more respect for the couple who traveled for
&gt; three years through Central and South America and Africa with their
&gt; VW van, at least they are using the camper for the purpose it was 
&gt; made for...
&gt;
Probably more of an economic decision than anything else...$10-
12,000 is a pretty big investment to risk on a daily driver...It makes
sense to conserve the vehicle to preserve its resale value...;-(

OTOH, it could just be practicality...Unless you're a VW aficionado,
it's just much easier/comfortable/safer/etc. to drive a modern car/
van on a day to day basis... ?-)
