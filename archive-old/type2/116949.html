Subject: Advice requested....'81 AdventureWagen

Hi, I've just joined the group for reasons which'll very soon be obvious ;-)
My wife and I are seriously considering the purchase of a neighbor's 1981
Vanagon L-based Adventurewagen, with just over 103,000 miles on it. It's
white, and cosmetically in what I'd call near-excellent condition. New
clutch 9,000 miles ago, engine rebuild 7,000 miles ago, brand new tires. The
gas gauge currently doesn't work, there's a hole in the windshield wiper
fluid reservoir, and the vent in the roof doesn't seem to want to open, but
everything else appears to be fully functional. Our neighbor is asking
$4,000; I'm wondering if this is a reasonable price, and if not what you'd
recommend we offer. The original owner was the father of the woman now
selling the vehicle; the engine and clutch replacements occured prior to his
death 3 years ago. As you can see, his daughter and her husband haven't put
too many more miles on it (a trip to Baja, California and some around-town
driving is it), which is why they've finally decided to sell it.

In searching for someone to inspect it, I got some disturbing feedback
yesterday morning from Frank's Automotive, a local foreign vehicle repair
shop. The manager pretty strongly warned me against purchasing an '81 model,
due to its aircooled, underpowered nature. He said that driving it in the
midst of a hot California summer, and especially in the inclines leading up
to Lake Tahoe, etc very quickly burns out the engines. He pointed me to '83
models, which he says were the first year that water cooling appeared, or
better yet an '86 or newer model, which has a more powerful engine.
Thoughts? And while I'm at it, one other thing I'm wondering about....due
both to the vehicle's height, its underpoweredness and its high center of
gravity, how scary is it to drive in a crosswind? A friend with a Westfalia
(popup top) had this concern.

Thanks in advance!
