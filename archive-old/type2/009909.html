&gt;i posted a message a little bit ago asking how to identify the engine in my
&gt;'73 bus.  i was told to check the engine number. well here it is...it's
&gt;CB071120.  i must admit that i have no clue as to what that means...also, i
&gt;saw a starter (which i need) in a junk-yard the other day.  does it pay to
&gt;get a used one???  or should i just buy a new one???  


CB is the engine code for 1972 and early 1973 dual carb manual transmission
engines. Used starters can be cheap but you might also want to go get one
&gt;from an auto parts store that is warrenteed. I recall some posts suggesting
that buy one for a manual transmision as it will fit and provide a little
more umph to your start. Auto trans startes have about a 1/8 or so more
horsepower in the starters motor. 

Happy busing
