Subject: Receptacle (exterior) for 110-125 A/C on 72 bus
Date: Sat, 05 Aug 2000 19:23:21 EDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

Does anyone know where I can find a replacement for the receptacle on the 
outside of the bus (driver's side that you plug external power into)?? 
Mine's pretty much rusted out. Looks like it came from an RV supplier. Maybe 
they carry them??? Thanks for any info!
