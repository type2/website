Subject: Re: [T2] Bodywork Question

Pete,

I know you have the problem solved, but let me add one more data point for
the archives...  I use a 6&quot; stiff putty knife and 1 kilo sledge. insert
the knife in the underside of the cover, up against the junction between
the cover and body clip, then giive the end of the knife a couple whacks
with the sledge.  Move the knife along a bit and do it again.  After 2-3
trips up and down the cover, it is popped along its length.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I've removed this part from 4 different rusty Ontario buses, and the way
&gt; that has worked for me is with a 12&quot; length of 1x4, slipped UNDER the cover
&gt; so it will apply force as closely as possible to the slot where the cover is
&gt; binding.
&gt;
&gt; Whack the board, move forward 6&quot;, give it another whack. Keep moving along
&gt; the cover from end to end working back and forth, and eventually it will let
&gt; loose.
&gt;
&gt; With the buses I've dismantled the screws almost always break as they're
&gt; coming apart. One trick I've found is to TIGHTEN the screws very slightly
&gt; before trying to loosen them, this will break the corrosion without
&gt; stripping the threads you need to back the screw out. It's a technique that
&gt; also helps with rounded out engine tin screws.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Happy trails,

&gt; &gt; I had a tough problem getting the passenger side cover off my bus.  The trick
&gt; &gt; for me was to use a 2x4 and a rubber mallet to knock it off.  Put the 2x4
&gt; &gt; lengthwise against the bottom of the cover and give it several knocks with the
&gt; &gt; rubber mallet.

&gt; &gt; there...........
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm getting The Duck ready for a paint job later this month. I've been
&gt; &gt; stripping her down. I took off the center runner cover behind the sliding
&gt; &gt; door. No problems; it turned out to be a pretty easy job. However, I am
&gt; &gt; running in to problems with the runner cover on the DRIVER side. There is no
&gt; &gt; sliding door on this side, but a cover is used on this side also. I managed
&gt; &gt; to get the three screws out from the bottom. But this thing will not budge.
&gt; &gt; Doesn't even wiggle. I know it cannot have the same screw driven pressure
&gt; &gt; mechanism holding it in place as the sliding door side cover. So, what
&gt; &gt; gives? How do I get this cover out?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sure would appreciate some input on this one.
&gt; &gt;
