Subject: Winter boredom

With the great freeze upon me, I tend
to dwadle around looking for things to do.
 
In lieu of actual produtive projects, I 
thought I might offer my welding services
for those of you with odds and ends that
need welded up for your VW.

I have both a wire feed and TIG welder
need some attention from me.  Drop
me some mail if your interested...
(I'm not looking for money, just
something to do)

take care all-

Matt
