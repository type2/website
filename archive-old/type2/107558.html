Subject: Bonnaroo Music Festival Tickets

Hi Everyone,

	The Westy was all loaded up and ready to leave for Tennessee tomorrow, but
a death in the family forces me to sell my 2 tickets to the Bonnaroo Music
Festival.  I will let them go at the $150.00ea face value, and will ship
them out via UPS Next Day at my cost as soon as I have the funds.  Let me
know if you are interested and we can set up the details.  Sorry for the
waste of Bandwidth...
