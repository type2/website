Mike,

Thanks for the info. I was thinking going up in engine size because someone 
told me it was a real slug in the mountains, and I would probaly load it 
pretty full and did'nt want to stress the engine. I appreciate the info, I'm 
brand new to the T2 world. I would gladly stick with the 1600 and not bring 
up any of these other issues.
As for the upper bed retro -fit, that fixed my interest in it! I was just 
thinking about more room, but with that said...I'll be even happier with my 
newest baby!
Again thanks!
