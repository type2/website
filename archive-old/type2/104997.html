&gt;Jennifer,
&gt;
&gt;Is this the westy you are talking about, I looked at it the other day and 
&gt;the people at the used car dealer said it wasn't for sale and someone was 
&gt;going to use it as a parts bus.
&gt;
&gt;If you are talking about another bus I'd be very interested to learn of 
&gt;where it's at.

That sure looks alot like a Westy that was running around Cookeville as 
recently as last year. The fellow I bought my bus from bought that one and 
was driving around in it. Then his finances fell on hard times, he closed 
his business, and tried to sell his bus. Dunno if or where or when it sold. 
I drove it one and the front end and brakes needed a total rebuild (pulled 
and wandered).
