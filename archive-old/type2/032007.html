David:

Sounds like you've got a project car here, i.e., you're not in a lather 
to get it together by Monday so you can get to work, so you can afford 
to take you time about figuring out what you're going to do.

If you have the tools and the facility to do so, I'd drop the engine and 
do at least a partial teardown.  I'd look at the heads and pistons and 
cylinders and try to determine if the problem originates here.  If you 
find something obvious (e.g., a dropped seat) then you can decide if you 
want to stop right there, without doing a complete teardown, fix what's 
broke and cross your fingers for the rest.  Doing a complete rebuild 
yourself is one of those complex risk/reward equations that no one can 
answer for you.  I will tell you, however, that you really can't do a 
complete rebuild (crankshaft on out) for less than what you can buy a 
rebuild for.  Assuming you already have the tools, you can do the &quot;check 
out&quot; for essentially nothing but your time.

&gt; 2.  How do I procede?  Does it seem worth checking out the engine before I 
&gt; consider it at total loss and essentially toss it?  It also appears to be 
&gt; complete, except a couple of pieces of engine tin and air hoses, probably 
&gt; from the goobers that tried to work on it.  I don't want to spend very much 
&gt; money checking out the engine that could go toward buying a rebuilt.
