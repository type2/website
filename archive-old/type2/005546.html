&gt; Also There is some kind of sender switch screwed into the very
&gt;rear of the '73 tranny (its not the back up light switch, this one is on
&gt;the very rear, up and right of the gear shift lever) It is 2 prong and has
&gt;a wire on one prong connecting to the same bolt as the ground
&gt;strap, obviously a ground connection. The 5 rib tranny did not have
&gt;this. What is it?

Vacuum advance cutoff switch, designed to be coupled w/ a temp sender and a valve
to cut off  dizzy vacuum advance below 54 deg. F.except while  in 4th gear. See Bentley.

&gt;...........she will be with a nice '73 transmission from Nantucket :)

I had a joke here, but i lost it. ( Nevermind :)
