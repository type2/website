Hi Volks,

&quot;T. Howze&quot; &lt;thowze_at_u.washington_dot_edu&gt; wrote to the List:

&gt; Does anyone have a solution for squeaky wiper blades?  My other wise
&gt; good right blade has a terrible squeak on the upstroke and I wondered
&gt; if there were any clever solutions to this annoyance...

On the (sorry...) Golf's rear wiper, I cured the squeak by bending 
the wiper arm a bit.  IMHO, wipers sqeak when the angle between them 
and the glass is greater than 90 degrees... like this:

   \  |
    \ |   --&gt; moving direction
_____\|___________   glass surface

So just bend the arm so that the angle is 90 degrees in both wiper 
moving directions, and it might cease to squeak.  This is easiest 
done by turning the wiper blade so that it forms a T handle with the 
wiper arm, and then twisting that in the appropriate direction (or 
the one chosen by trial and error... :-)

Good luck,
    Erik.
