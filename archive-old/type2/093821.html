&lt;&lt;  Anyway, I have not done any serious research.  The casual research I 
have done leads me to believe that airplane emissions, while certainly a 
concern, are less of a concern than passenger car emissions.  Perhaps I 
should have prefaced my statements with &quot;I believe&quot;, but I figured everyone 
would take it with salt anyway.  If you really want to go after a polluter, 
hit the big rig trucks, now THAT is a environmental disaster.  There is 
almost no real enforced emission standards for those vehicles, and many of 
them are purposely run VERY rich for extra power.

Historically, they're there because the railroads and short line trams were
forced out by the auto industry (Think &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;) and the
gov't financed (Think &quot;You &amp; Me&quot;) highway system. Prior to the development
of the highway system, population centers were cities...Came the highways
and cars and the population sprawled out to the suburbs and now even ex-
urbs...(Think living in the Poconos, PA, and working in NYC...)
