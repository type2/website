you need to jet the carbs. Read the jetting article (twice) on our site. An
A/F gauge helps a lot.

&gt; I have an 81 Westy that was a European model, thus no FI.  The motor is
&gt; recently rebuilt, and runs well.  However, I still question whether the
&gt; dizzy is correct.
&gt;
&gt; Prior to rebuild, the car had a Weber progressive on it, and a dual vacuum
&gt; advance dizzy.  Motor was shot, thus no power.
&gt;
&gt; After rebuild, switched to dual Weber 44's, great power to 55mph, then
&gt; really none in 4th gear.  I am running 009 dizzy now.
&gt;
&gt; The car is not getting very good mileage compared to an FI vehicle.  And
the
&gt; power from the 44's is not felt.  Any ideas?  I would like better MPG, and
&gt; power.
