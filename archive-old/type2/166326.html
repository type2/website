&gt; Hi Dan,
&gt; 
&gt; Looks like the cost on those units is about $1100. Did you find any deals?
&gt; Did you look at any other manufacturers? Any extra info would help.

I was able to find it locally.  They wanted $1300 for it, but in the end 
they reduced the price to the lowest on-line price I could find.  That 
was Ebay buy it now, and buying it locally saved on shipping.  The unit 
cost just north of $1000 and the tank was $225.  Espar has some petrol 
variants, but prices are considerably more.  I wasn't able to find other 
similar products.

This project is not for the faint of wallet by any means, but the 
rewards are well worth the investment in my book.
