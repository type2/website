James:

        This is an easy one [complements of Grandpa...I mean Bob
Hoover], take a four to six foot cheater and your bathroom scales [or those
of your neighbour ;)].  Put your socket and breaker on the nut so that
you are pulling up to tighten it.  Snug it up.  Now get on the scales,
and slide the cheater in place.  Grab the cheater precisely 4' out from
the centre of the socket.  Now pull that sucker up until your weight on
the scales increases by 67.5 lbs.  This will give you 270 ftp/lb of
torque on the nut which is close enough [a weight increase of 54.75
lbs will give you 271...if your bathroom scales are that precise ;)]

All done, and you don't need no stinking big torque wrench.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
