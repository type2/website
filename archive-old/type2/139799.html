&gt;       i've checked the archive and my owner's manuel but oddly enough
&gt; still have questions.  my comprehesion skills are not what they once
&gt; were.  right now i am running valvoline 20w50 full synthetic in my 1975
&gt; type 4 bus engine with a 3 speed automic tranny.  on a recent trip from
&gt; saint louis mo to colombia mo driving i drove at speeds, according to my
&gt; speedometer, of 65 to 70 mph.  at these speeds my oil pressure
&gt; gauge(VDO)never dropped below 50 psi.  i have no reason to doubt the
&gt; truthfullness of this gauge though the fledgling american government had
&gt; no reason to doubt aaron burr either.  that bastard.  the oil temp gauge
&gt; read between 180 and 212 predomintly (sp).  i have good reason to doubt
&gt; this gauge.  don't ask why.  all i can say is that when i ask it a
&gt; question it can never look me in the eyes when it answers.  also, the
&gt; ambiant atmoshpere was wet and rainy with a temp in the 40's F.  is the
&gt; oil pressure acceptable?  should i switch to a 10w30 syn. or a 15w40?
&gt; thanks in advance for any and all sage and insightful(l) or anecdotal
&gt; advice.  not that anecdotal advice can't also be sage and insightful....
&gt;

your results sound fine to this bus pilot, I use 15W-50 sythetic myself
