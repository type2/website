I doubt if it would age any faster.  It will skip more mounted in a bus
dash unless you fasten a backstrap on the player.  You may want to look
into a CD changer/controller option.  IMHO it's a better way to go
because you can stash the changer where some &lt;obscenity deleted&gt; stereo
thief can't get at it or wouldn't want to deal with it.  Or, for the
ultimate CD solution, just buy a cheap portable player and plug it into
the RCA jacks on your EQ/amp.  Or if you don't have an amp buy a cheap
high power tape deck and use a CD tape adapter.  Little or no theft
worries there plus those things will play upside down, sideways,
backwards, etc...
