Subject: Off topic question for Cali people

One of my good friends in College (Saddleback College, Mission Viejo, 
CA) was a total VW fanatic.

Name = Lars Yahr

I was wondering if anyone knows him, knows OF him, or has heard any 
vicious rumors about him.

Back in the day, he was one of the original Festival of Animation 
krewe...he may still be doing that as well.

Anyone?

Let me know,
Anton
