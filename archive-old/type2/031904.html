Subject: How do I learn to use my new dial indicator?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.981226151536.25871A-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

Hi all:

My mother-in-law, nice person that she is, got me a new Craftsman dial 
indicator for Christmas.  The enclosed &quot;instruction manual&quot; mainly 
covered the care and usage of an outside micrometer (???) and had all of 
one page on the dial indicator itself.  As a result, I have no good idea 
how to use this thing, i.e., how the included bits and pieces are 
attached to the gauge, and in what circumstances what parts are to be used.

Does anybody have any recommendations as to books and/or web sites that 
cover the care and usage of precision measuring devices, particularly my 
dial indicator?

Oh yea, (OBC) I plan to use the dial indicator to measure crankshaft 
endplay on my 2.0l engine rebuild.
