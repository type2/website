Subject: Re: Flying Sparks

Thanks for all the spark gap faulty plug scenarios and ideas.

Ok, I neglected to include this. The bus I was working on was about a
1968 and I think I remember it was the number one cylinder. Both a new
plug and the old plug were tried and both did it. The spark plug wire was
tested for ohms and was good and another plug wire from another hole was
tried.
Nothing changed the flying spark phenom.

&gt; &gt; I have seen this phenomenon on a VW and on a Toyota.
&gt; &gt; Can anybody explain why this happens.

&gt; &gt; &gt; - If I pull the wire from cyl. 2, it actually speeds up if I allow
&gt; &gt; &gt; sparks to fly through the air (&gt;1.5 cm!), but if I put it back the
&gt; &gt; &gt; wire it goes back to the old RPM. Which is the same as when I do
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; allow the sparks to fly, by the way.
