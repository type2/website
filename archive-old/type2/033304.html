&gt; You don't need to sag!  Just adjust the bars you have and you'll be
&gt; nice and level.  I did it to my '71 and it's well worth the effort.
&gt; I've not heard of breakage problems except in the case of bars being
&gt; heavily preloaded.

First, exactly is a &quot;station wagon&quot; and how does one find out for sure
if one has a station wagon or other bus?

Second, If I have a station wagon and have the original lighter torsion
bars, will the heavier bars from the &quot;all other&quot; '68-71's fit directly
into my station wagon (if it is indeed such) directly, without
modification?  As we have installed a pullout bed-backseat from a '72
for camping in the back of my '71 (station wagon?), and when we do camp,
we usually have 3 kids and 2 large adults in the bus, with a stove,
cookware, sleeping bags, clothing, lantern, fuel, ice-filled ice chest,
small tent, etc. it would be nice to have a bus that rode a little
higher when loaded, maybe it would handle a little better.  OOh, ooh,
maybe I could see out the rear window with the rearview mirror when the
bus isn't loaded . . .!

We have a '72 hard-top camper up back we use for some parts.  It had the
bed and has a stove, suicide cabinet, water tank, electrical hook-ups,
so I am wondering if it indeed has the heavier torsion bars.  What would
I need to check to find if it does have heavier torsion bars?

Does Bentley give specific instructions on adjustment and/or
installation of torsion bars?  I cannot find our Bentley manual at this
time.

Would a reputable VW repair place be able to install/adjust torsion
bars, or is this considered dangerous and would need to go to a
specialist?

Thanks,

Lauria Watts
