Subject: Re: [T2] Headlights

Now, I'm curious why you needed a new fuse box, relays, et cetera, to 
upgrade your headlights... will the stock system not handle a pair of H4s? 
I've been curious about upgrading mine, but it's always been on the &quot;to do 
later&quot; list...

&gt;I've about finished the headlight relay upgrade. By the way the Radio Shack
&gt;$5.99 30-amp relays are the very same ones as the relay I've gotten in both
&gt;my Hella 500 kits.
