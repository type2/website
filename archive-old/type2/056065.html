OK folks, got the beast back running (don't ask) and it seemed to be 
running ALMOST ok, but then started to stall at idle, no power under 
load, and now, not able to stay started without help. Here's how it 
went:
 New points (regapped them several times...) new condensor, 
rotor, cap.  Tried spraying carb cleaner to detect leak (as per my 
mechanics suggestion) and I sprayed around a bit, nothing, sprayed in 
the air cleaner (new element) and Voila! it ran better, then back 
down, seemed a little better, took around the block, shut 
down,thought I had fixed it,just needed tuning,  was going to change 
the plugs, thought I should wait for it to cool, and regapped points 
instead, ran lousy, regapped again, ran lousy, tried the spray in the 
air cleaner again, and it now runs worse when I do that.

Before it ran well, by accident, I had left the ignition on for 45 
minutes and the coil was very hot.  This is just before it started 
running well for the 10 or so minutes (but it wasn't normal, just a 
little better) but I also noticed that I hear a loud buzzing/hissing 
(more buzzing) from the fuel pump.  Could this be my problem (Yike$!) 
or do they all buzz like that and I'm just normally in the drivers 
seat?  I'm purt near ready to take this in, except for my fear of 
what it will cost.  Also, a lot of ticking (or is it my imagination?) 
from #3 cylinder, but more than others?  I cant decide anything 
anymore, too many fumes in my brain.
