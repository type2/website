Subject: Fuel line dimensions

Hi all,
I hate to ask such a simple question, but I am a bit
short on time and today is going to be kinda crazy.
This morning I was leaving to work when I smelled gas.
Looked under the bus and noticed a leak in the larger
hose that goes from the fuel filter to the fuel pump.
I clamped the hose off and got to work by another
means. Does anyone know the ID of that hose as I need
to pick some up on my way home.
Your help is much apreciated!
