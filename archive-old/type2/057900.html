Time and money force the sale of my beloved Tangerine.  It has taken me
cross-coutry and back, and I have very fond memories.

It does run and could be delivered most places in the SoCal area.  Almost
rust-free, so little in fact that I don't actually know if it has any at
all.  Some nose damage, new poptop canvas, original paint in pretty good
shape.  More details available.  In Los Angeles, asking $700.

Steve
