Subject: Re:Steering Column Removal?

Phil,
   You don't need to remove the steering column or steering box to
replace the horn ground wire.  If the old wire is still in place use
it to pull the new wire through the steering shaft, if not use a coat
hanger or other stiff piece of wire to get the new ground wire through
the steering shaft.  The bottom end of that ground wire will need a
ring terminal attached to it.  The ring goes to one of the bolts
holding the rubber coupling to the steering box input flange.  It has
to be one one of the bolts that goes through the steering box input
flange as it gets ground through the box.  Now, on the top end of the
wire install a female spade connector so it can attach to the male
spade on that spring loaded plate under your horn botton.
