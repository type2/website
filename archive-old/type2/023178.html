&gt;Folks,

==============================&gt;
I had a really nice over $100 unit in one of my earlier buses, and then 
moved it to Casper.
After a while, I discovered it was just always in the way when I wanted to 
send Mary Beth back to rear area to fetch me a cold one.

I now use a smaller unit in both of my buses, and simply install them with 
the back pointing to the front (backwards).

On one, I mounted my amateur radio transceiver, and can now move the radio 
from bus to bus at will.

Here is what my console looks like, and I am happy with it.

Big enuff to hold stuff, but not so big as to get in the way and need 
jumping over to get to the rear are.
Made by &quot;Steel horse&quot; or something like that, and I got it at PEP Boys for 
around $30.00, as I recall.
