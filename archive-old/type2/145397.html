Subject: re:Hagerty Insurance

I've had my 65 Double cab insured through Hagerty for
5 to 10 years, don't recall for sure, and then insured
my 75 bus with them also, when it was old enough to
qualify--I think it was 25 years old so that would
have been in 2000 I suppose.  Neither one is a camper
of course, but the insurance is really affordable
(maybe $200 a year for both of them with full coverage
and declared value, $10k on the double cab, and I have
since switched coverage of our daily drivers to the
agent that sells Hagerty because of the good service.
Of course the other cars are with a different company.

Jim, in Menomonie, WI
