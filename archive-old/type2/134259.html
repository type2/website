Subject: Re:brake booster line

Jason,

    To replace the vacuum hose use 15/32 of an inch vacuum line.  I
spent the better part of a Saturday driving around to auto parts
stores and noone carried vacuum hose that big.  Most of them tried to
sell me heater hose, don't accept that.  I finally tried a place that
also deals in truck parts as well as car parts.  They had a big roll
of the 15/32 vacuum line.  Get the right stuff, you'll be glad you
did.
