Hi Bob,

VW probably paid a product placement fee to have their product in the  
film. Despite the fact that they don't have a product in North  
America's  minivan market, they know that the exposure from LMS can't  
hurt them. And the typical viewer of LMS is definitely in the  
demographic for a golf, jetta, or passat.

Case in point: VW of Canada sponsors the &quot;Discovery Award&quot; at the  
Toronto International Film Festival. To promote that award, they play  
a 45-second trailer at the beginning of every movie in the festival  
made by a first-time director. My bus is a critical prop in that  
trailer.

I rented it to the production studio for two days of shooting, and  
received about $350CDN. They used it for static shots on a Thursday  
and then went on locatio n with it on the Saturday. I assisted in the  
on-location work as a technician to make sure the bus would behave  
itself and perform on-cue as expected.

It was a fun day, but not without a fair amount of stress.  There's a  
write-up here:

(Scroll down past the pics for the text, it'll tell you a lot about  
putting vehicles in film.)


Happy Trails,

&gt;&gt; Sounds to me like they aren't happy about it either.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; wonder how much &quot;little miss sunshine&quot; paid VW to use their bus,  
&gt; and your
&gt; art certainly was less derogatory than the door falling off and push
&gt; starting etc.
