Subject: Re: [T2] lube it or just go at it dry?

&gt;looking into putting together the 36hp motor for the 57, and I've run into
&gt;two different schools of thought. Builder number one(factory trained in
&gt;germany many years ago when 25/36hp was what there was) says to oil the p's
&gt;and c's when assembling the motor, builder number two(many years experience
&gt;building stock and race motors, one of the few local builders who's work has
&gt;a good rep) says that oiling them helps make an oil burner out of your motor
&gt;and that they are best left dry. Opinions?

Oil it - every engine I've ever built or helped on got oil. All have been 
just fine.

You risk (without oiling) wrecking the cylinder walls you were so careful 
with. It might make the rings bed a bit faster but why risk it.

A good question would be - does the factory assemble with oil?
