Really?  But every Mercedes has an ashtray.  Let's see if I 
understand:  Smoking and driving is okay, but drinking a soda while driving 
isn't?  Excuse me for snickering but the US Yuppies were right on in this case.

I have two cup holders in the front of my bus, and am considering adding 
two more.  Reason being sometimes my SO and I order two drinks AND two ice 
cream sundaes at the drive through.  You can never have enough cup holders.
