Subject: Jalousie window rattle

Hello all. Does anyone out there have a fix for rattles in the jalousie 
windows? Mine make quite a bit of racket when traveling. I was thinking about 
sealing the individual window segments with weatherstripping tape, to keep 
them from making so much noise, but an worried that they might not seal 
correctly. Anybody else with this problem, or a cure for it?
Thanks again,
