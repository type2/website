Hey Grant, list

Just took the bus out for a rather crude test. I took a 1 hour run, the same
run I had taken several weeks ago under similar conditions. I ran the bus at
70 mph. The earlier readings after one hour were 256 degrees and slowly but
steadily rising. Today the temp seemed to level off at about 251 degrees.
(it's about 93 degrees out today)At 60-65 (normal driving speeds for me) the
temps seem to steady at about 230. It seems like a drop of about 5 degrees
after my fan was cleaned, results preliminary. BTW, after two hours on my
knees I began to wonder whether or not the fan can be removed without
dropping the engine. Would anyone happen to know? Bentley didn't clear this
up for me. Looks like there are three 12 point socket-head screws holding it
on.
Thanks

&gt; &gt;I thought I'd mention that I just spent a couple hours cleaning the fan
on
&gt; my 1700cc type4 engine. It was black and covered with a hard, crusty
grime.
&gt; Seemed to me that a clean fan might help the bus run cooler.
&gt;
&gt; Hey Rich, I just had the same entertainment.  I figured that if the
hollows
&gt; of the blades cake up with gunk, they won't suck as much air.  So we'll
see,
&gt; maybe now our fans will be more efficient as well as more attractive.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
