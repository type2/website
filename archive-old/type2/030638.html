hello there listees long time no post, but 18 hours of classes this semester
will do that to you.  I owe it to the list to post this little find i made...
I go to school at SIU..southern Illinois university, while going to find a
supposed half pipe for skate boarding about a week ago I made the following
discoveries, on my way to where the ramp is there was a beat up mid 60's
beetle in faded red, definite possible resto project, as i rounded the corner
to the ramp, I saw a bay window bus, another project, but the coolest was what
is right by the ramp it is a late 60's splitty window bus with the rag top
sunroof and the little windows all around it.  21 window bus if my mind serves
me.  It looks like it needs work but most of it is there, the back soor above
the engine compartment is nissing along with the seats on the inside and it
looks like it needs some skilled hands at body work...I could not see the full
bus as it is in grass that is about chest high and thick....   If anyone
wishes to know more you can get a hold of me here at this address or at
keurouac_at_siu_dot_edu or 618 351-0684

thanx

mike
