You know,
The originally issued owner's manual that is in the glove box of one of 
my 1600 single port equipped 1970 (NewBus) buses says: .004&quot; all way 
around.

I have always been adjusting Casper (my other 1970 bus) to .006&quot;

I have always been curious about the .004 vs. .006 value spread !?!?!?
Comments, or is this old hash to be found in archives somewhere??
