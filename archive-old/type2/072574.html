I've torn apart and more or less put back together ac vw engines about
twenty times but today I managed to remove a transaxle for the first time.
It is on my '71 Westy. The engine was already out and it took about three
more hours to remove the transaxle.  It was a first for me and I'd like to
bet a first for my Westy.

The hardest part was removing the self taping screw which holds the shift
rod to the trans shaft.  Frozen. Stuck. Wouldn't budge.  Heating didn't
help.  An overnight soak in Kroil didn't help. Then I remembered a hint
that has circulated on this list and others.  The parafin moment.  We
happened to have sticks of it in the attic left over from a Christmas
candle making session.  I heated the screw with a heat gun and fed parafin
to it,  much the way that one feeds solder to a heated wire. I watched as
some of the parafin wicked up behind the screw head and, I hoped, into the
threads.  The first time I put a wrench to the screw after doing this, it
spun so easily that at first I was sure I had stripped the head. Not so.
After it cooled, I was able to withdraw it with my fingers.

I could use help, though.  Last year, I bought a set of three nylon
bushings to fit the type II shift rod. Instaling the one up front,
underneath the shifter, was quite easy.  The other two were not accessible
without removing the trans.  The two I have left are not identical to each
other.  I would appreciate having someone describe where these go and how
to install them.

I bet anyting that one goes just behind the coupler.  If so,  then the
cause of my lousy shifting is now clear. There is no bushing there and the
rod is free to move more than a cm.

Can anyone help?
Jack
