&gt; checked out by a trusted VW mechanic on monday, so we'll see what

 I suspect your rotor is warped. Not a cheap prospect. I would say live with
it and try to line up a good used one or save for a new one. I think they are
in the 70-$80 range new and you will have to have a new or used one turned.
(I know, Dr. Tim sez never turn them, but I think for a new or used one it is
appropriate), and then the cost to replace it if you can't do it yourself.
