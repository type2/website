Charlie

Think you have a great idea here. When I signed up for the Westy owners
list a couple of years ago I thought that it would serve a similar
purpose, but no calls yet.

You might look at their pages at http://www.westfalia_dot_org.

The BPRS listing could include contact points, a service available list
including local computer access and recommended garages, a printable
list for travel (possibly in map reference order), ways to contact the
list or a BPRS reference person(s).

Your message covers a lot of this and the above is just my current
thoughts on the subject.

Run with it, big Bro.!!

Bill
