Subject: 1977 seat differences

I am about to re-pad my 1977 Westy Berlin seats. But my local stockist only has TMI listed &gt;76 seat padding. Being in the UK I don't want to wait 8 weeks to sort my seats out while I wait for delivery, as I am off to Europe in 2 weeks.

Just wondering if anyone knew the difference between a 76 seat and 77 seats, and could I tweak the padding set to work on a 77 seat.

Thank you for any advice
Steve
