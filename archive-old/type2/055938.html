Yes it was fun. 

Got up saturday AM and the weather was shitty, had to work till noon, was
COLD, raining in the fog in these mountains, thought about skipping it.......
But the bus was all packed and my two youngest daughters were up for the trip.
So..........

About 30 miles from the event the sky cleared and it was on. 

Met Dave Easterwood (again) as he was leaving. Met Ted (with the cool gold bus
stuff)  Steve (with cool german tent), and others whose names are lost. Lynn
was there selling list hats on Sunday and doing pretty good on the other stuff
he does on his magic machine. Missed Blake again I guess. Doug Lloyd was there
with his beautifiul Bug (he slept in it). If he does the same job on the 67
deluxe I sold him, it will be a show stopper. All really nice guys. Lucky to
be associated with them.

Ermal puts on a good show. Had stuff for the kids to do, rides etc... And
hired some locals for the campfire music. Three Bluegrass girls- fiddle,
guitar, banjo-- Very nice touch. 

Sunday AM it rained for about 10 mins then nice agin. Charlie Ford and Gus
came for breakfast, and to catch up. I really hope the book project does well.
I want a copy :-)).

At the awards Tootsie (my third daughter) won 3rd in the Miss Circle Yer
Wagons class. All the entries were under 10 years so don't look for it in &quot;Hot
VW Babes&quot;. I think Steve and Ted won also but were long gone by then. Better
call and ask youse guys.

My old college buddy Rob showed up on Sunday for a visit. He looked around and
said &quot;There really are others just like you!&quot;, as the thing is really turning
into a bus event. I guess the weather turned away the serious trailer cars.
Bus to bug was about 1:1.

Trip home was interesting. Still had the CB hooked up from the Hippy days
event, so monitored chanel 19. DO NOT underestimate the &quot;Road Rage&quot; thing. I
was fine at 60-65, but the slower guys in RVs were really getting a blasting
from some of those A**holes. I hate interstate driving.

Had a good time, bus ran cool, wish I had taken my dad (it is his bus), but he
is 84 years young and was miserable on the Hippy Run in the rain. Maybe next
time. :-)

Peace Baby,

I'm not a bus addict, baby, thats a lie.
