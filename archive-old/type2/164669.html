Subject: removing steering cover plate

Well still trying to troubleshoot my horn. I discovered that the wire coming
down the spade connector at the bottom of the steering column is not
connected to the female spade connector that is sitting there. I believe
that this is the ground for the horn. I can see the wires, and I can feel
the wires, I just can't get my fingers in there from underneath to
reconnect. I'm not sure why it is disconnected anyway.

 

I looked at Bentley, and see the cover plate inside the cab at the bottom of
the steering column should be removable. I unscrewed it from the floor, and
it moves side to side, but not up and down. The seal and plastic clamping
ring appear to be too tight to slide up the cover plate thing. I can't
figure out how to remove this/pull up the cover plate. I think if I just
pull up the plate, I should be able to see the wires underneath, and
reconnect them. I don't want to ruin the clamping ring, as it looks as
though the PO changed it recently.

 

Any suggestions, do I just need to pry the cover plate up and the seals will
slide?
