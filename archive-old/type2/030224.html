&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I just loosened the clamp that goes around the small end of the CV joint
&gt; boot up near the transmission. Whatever is in there came running out. It
&gt; seemed to have the viscosity and general appearance of gear oil. Is it
&gt; possible that gear oil has somehow leaked out of the tranny and into the CV
&gt; boot, or has the grease just gone bad? This only happened with one of the
&gt; four boots.

IF it's the boot on the transmission end of the shaft, it could be gear
oil.  there is a seal that goes in the output flange of the transmission
that keeps the oil in the trans.  It may have popped out or developed a
hole.

Solution:

Remove axle.

if boots are in good shape, clean tranny end boot with paper towels as
well as you can to get the gear oil and grease out.  Wipe the CV and get
as much of the oil/grease mixture out as possible.

Replace the plug in the middle of the transmission output flange.

Pack new CV grease into the CV and boot you cleaned.

Reinstall axle
