Subject: vacuum puzzle

Back again!  Discovered that part of my woes stemmed from a hydraulic
lifter that would not pump up and bad valve adjustments.  This is finally
fixed, no clatter.  Great!  Now back to the vacuum...

Again, I still cannot start the bus and keep it idling unless I open the
throttle, just a tiny bit.  Have to lean a brick on the accel pedal once
it is started to keep it idling.  Otherwise, idle is super low (despite
the fact that the idle screw is way out), and the engine dies.  Vacuum
now reads 16&quot;-18&quot;!  Yeah!  So, I let the engine warm up a bit more,
take the brick off the pedal: the idle drops down low again and the engine
barely runs.  Vacuum is down to about 7&quot;.  Huh?  I have tried Steve
Dolan's great idea of blocking all the air hoses off.  Still the same
results (must admit: didn't do the oil breather since I don't have a cork
that fits it yet... could it be?).

What would make the vac drop so low?  It seems all the pieces are in front
of me, but I cannot put them together.  Other info: I also have to advance
the timing to about 8BTDC just to keep idle going.  Setting timing at
5ATDC is just not possible at this point.  Vacuum at retard side of the
dizzy _is_ now present.

Wots, uh, the deal???!
