Subject: westy upholstery fix
Message-ID: &lt;NCBBJEFFCLGDAAAKPANBEELLCBAA.olyo_at_imt_dot_net&gt;

I haven't seen this covered in the last 1.5yrs and can't find a  reference in
the archives so here goes:
Looking over my rear westy seats(blue/green plaid from a 75 westy) I  note the
fabric is in great shape, holding good colour and no rips or  gross staining.
The padding is quite beat.
I have 10 and 11yr old  sons, my fiance', cohabitant, has 9 and 13 yr old sons,
we use this bus as a daily driver and it shows.
My thought is to carefully pry the staples out of the wood and simply  replace
the foam.
Now, having attempted many fixes assuming I had a handle on it, I know there
will some sort of pitfall(s).  Has anyone done this or similar  work?
I need recommendations on the type of material and the thickness to buy.
Are there density ratings for this stuff?
TIA
