&gt; Can anyone (and everyone) please tell me if they've heard of West Coast
&gt; Metric and what they think of WCM? I'm working with them now and want 
&gt; to get your opinions as to what kind oforganization they run?

Two things suggest to me that I'd rather not do business with WCM.

The first is that they sent a freind of mine the wrong wiring harness
for his 63 deluxe microbus, and refused to take it back until he had his
credit card company cancel payment. Their customer service people were
pretty rude. (This was about four years ago.)

The second is that a couple years ago their catalog featured a full-page
cartoon of Adolf Hitler, with a label under it saying &quot;our president,&quot;
or something like that. Something about it the way they presented the
cartoon seemed very offensive, and it seemed to me that if I were to
complain, they really wouldn't care. I realize that this is pretty
subjective, but at the very least I would question their judgement.
