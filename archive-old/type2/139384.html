Hi all,



I noticed that lots of you run two batteries one for driving, one for
camping. When you camp do you just switch the cables or is there some
sort of switch you install to switch batteries? It sounds cool, I would
love to have my radio on at night and not be worried if I could start in
the morning. What is the most common way to go about the two battery
setup?



Thanks,



Max Bronsema
