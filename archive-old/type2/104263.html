&gt;As I recall back in the mid 70's when there were a lot of these engines
&gt;and buses around (and I worked at a VW dealership one summer) the seal
&gt;was of a slightly different design than it is today.  As I remember it,
&gt;rather than two &quot;squared off&quot; sides as they seem to be today, one side
&gt;was more rounded, kinda like a half circle (but not quite).  That
&gt;slightly rounded side was on the top and the squared off side (which was
&gt;shiny) faced the bottom.

Different manufacturer?

There are some pictures of the seal in the Bentley. They aren't color and
only show one side but it appears from the texture in the photographs that
the darker side goes down:

Fuel System, Fig. 5-5, 5-6, 5-15
Fuel Injection, Fig. 7-4
