yeah, i want more!  after you called me and told me some of what you'd done
and had seen in germany and i was so lit up!  i stopped at the shop later
that evening and told juan about your trip, he said that even though i
didn't go, i was excited like i had.  i hope herr lotterman won't let a few
unscrupulous people ruin the fun for him and the others now looking forward
to next time.  a friend asked me if i had tickets already!  my enthusiasm
must be showing.  to think i deleted lots of messages that had the look of
camberg stories as i didn't want to get depressed cuz i hadn't gone.
anyway, thanks jenn for sharing the adventure.  i lived it vicariously
through you, next time in the flesh!

cheers,
