Subject: Re: [T2] mystery e-mails from the list?

I  received several of these E-Mails yeterday too.

I searched the web for the named sender, and it's a VW restoration shop
in Lake Charles La.

I wrote them from their web site address, and asked them if the Cajun's
were going nut's down there or what----

No reply as of yet----

Later,


Terry
