As a lucky resident of Brookings, Oregon, I can attest to the beauty of =
the trip they are embarking.  Should at least head this way and make it =
as far as Gold Beach, the scenery is spectacular.  Plenty of &quot;Westy&quot; =
spots to overnight, and an added bonus is whale watching time and Salmon =
season on the Rouge River.
Plus helping hand is nearby!
