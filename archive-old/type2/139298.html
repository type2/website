&gt; Hello Mark  It really doesnt matter where the vacuum can is as long as
&gt; it doesnt interfer with setting the timing    What I would like to
&gt; know is why the cheap tune up parts  look at the points and rotor  
&gt; and when was that condenser last changed??    One word for you 
&gt; BOSCH        :)       

The condensor is more or less new. The flash on the camera is cruel.
Will be replacing points with Bosch. This is what the local VW parts
place had (not the dealer). Distributor was found in a junkyard after
two years of searching for the correct one (009 came with bus); had
some strange two-vacuum line distributor in between.

Nobody, that I recall, has ever posted a mini-essay on the difference
between &quot;cheap&quot; points and Bosch points. If they have, I missed it. But
why don't you, Mark?

&gt;  Damn starting to sound like Dr. Tim      LOL

You could do worse than to sound like Doktor Tim.
