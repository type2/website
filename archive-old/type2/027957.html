Subject: Re: Pop-Top hold-down improvements?! Ideas???

&gt;&gt;The one thing that bothers me the *most* when I travel
&gt;&gt;is the way the Pop-Top jumps, rumbles, clangs and
&gt;&gt;vibrates every time a semi passes or I get caught in
&gt;&gt;strong wind! I have this continuing fear that it will
&gt;&gt;open on me when I'm travelling a 60mph!

I had a European-spec '71 that included a type of hook under the pop top at the front of the bus. On the early westies (my '70 particularly), this is where the wind would catch and lift the top as Semi's swoshed by. This did not occur at all on my '71.

The hook/eye arrangement used hardware very similar to what fastens the top back of the passenger seat in bay window buses. The trick was that as you lifted the top up and back, the angle of lift caused this hook to disengage with the eye (the eye was on the bus side; the hook on the top). Placement would obviously be of the utmost importance an would have to be determined with the top down, but matched so the top would lift as well. I do not remember exactly how the hook was attached to the top, but I suspect it was connected to a wooden brace as well as to the fiberglass top.

Chris Venema (cvenema_at_uafsysb.uark_dot_edu) owned this bus after me if you want to see if he knows more about this hook.

Have fun! Joe
