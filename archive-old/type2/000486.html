&gt; Two weeks, and still waiting for vanagon shocks.
&gt; the Tromper


Now, I'm at home right now so I can't look up the individual order(s) in
question. But I've got to admit a little confusion myself.  The website says
to allow 7-10 working days for delivery. This could work out to close to two
weeks, depending on the item and considering that July 5 was not a working
day according to the post office and UPS.  But I have had no vanagon shock
orders waiting for two weeks. These are a regular-stock item that goes out
almost immediately.

If you order via the website, you will receive an immediate confirmation on
the website itself, with a confirmation number, saying that your order went
through. This will be followed by an auto-response e-mail, within minutes
(depending on your ISP's speed), also listing your confirmation number.
This will be followed, within one working day, by a personal e-mail from
Jerry DeBaun, indicating your actual order number.  As the website states,
if you do not receive all three, your order did not make it through the
information superhighway to us. This is why we send not one but three
separate confirmations.  The www is, unfortunately, not 100% reliable, so we
want you to have every indication possible if your order did not go through.

We are open 11 am to 7 pm weekdays, E.D.T.  Sometimes we do get busy and the
phone may ring a while. There are three to five of us depending on the day,
so that's as many people as we can talk to at once. But if you just either
let it ring a bit, or try again a few minutes later, we can easily tell you
the status of your order. And as I've said before, you can always e-mail me
directly at busdepot_at_email_dot_com (although calling is certainly faster since I
only get to check my email about once a day).

I'm not saying that no orders get delayed, or lost, or screwed up.
Sometimes an order does go through just fine but we manage to screw it up
royally anyway. We are always seeking inventive ways to screw up orders.
:-)  Other times there's a snafu like a credit card number or billing
address that comes back unverifiable, an order where a UPS center in Japib,
Kansas calls us to say that the street address on the package doesn't exist,
etc.  I've got a handful of orders like that, where we have been unable to
reach the customer to let him know about the problem, so they just sit there
and every couple of days at the end of the day we go through the pile and
try to call the people again. But if you're waiting two weeks for shocks,
and haven't even received a confirmation messaage, then something's
definately wrong. It could be we don't even have your order in the first
place. (I'll check tomorrow, of course.)  I know for a fact that I don't
have any two-week-old shock orders sitting in-house.  My point is, you dont
have to ask the list what to do. All you have to do is ask me!  As everybody
knows, I'm very accessable on the list, and you all know my phone number and
private e-mail address.
