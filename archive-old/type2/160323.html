Subject: Re: [T2] Side Sliders?

Hi Jim,
You can see the sliding window on my bus in this picture:
http://www2.zackswagon_dot_com:8000/bus/side_view.jpg

The slider is the middle window, which is the only place I've ever  
seen them.  The vent window has a different name, perhaps vent window  
even.  I don't know what different types of busses came with sliders.

The sliding portion of the window is the front half, if slides back  
almost its whole length and provides a ton of refreshing air to cool  
off those passengers in the back of the bus.  I like them for  
driving... but I think I might prefer jalousies for camping, because  
of the screen.

Well, there ya have it.

Best Regards,
Zack
