Subject: Popping noises and lack of power

Hi all,

I am new to the list and have my first question. I was driving my
recently purchased '78 bus the other day and noticed a sudden loss of
power accompanied by popping sounds coming from the back. I crept my way
to my uncles house with a top speed of about 15 MPH and left it parked
there. We tinkered around a little and found that the relay wire to the
cold start valve had melted, which explained why it wouldn't start in
the morning but started fine when I got home from work in the evening,
and that the exhaust system is rusty and pitted with holes. My uncle
thinks the popping noises could be from and exhaust leak (exhaust
gasket?).

I want to replace the exhaust system but am a little confused on what to
buy since it is a Califonia bus and has the catalitic converter and all
the exhaust systems I look at say &quot;not legal in CA&quot;

So does this sound like an exhaust problem? and if so what kind and
where do I buy an exhaust system that is reasonably priced but Cali
legal?

thanks for the help!
