Subject: Re: [T2] Removing and Replacing Windows

Paul,

I am just getting ready to do this on my '76 bus.  I've done it before and 
it's not too hard.  Just takes some patience.

To remove the windows I just take a plastic putty knife or other hard flat 
object (plastic helps so I don't scratch the paint) and begin prying up the 
rubber from inside.  You have to &quot;flip &quot; it over the window sill.  As you 
go, a little pressure applied on the window, forcing it out will keep the 
rubber some slipping back in.  Work your way around the window a few times.  
Don't try to push one side all the way out before the other has been worked 
out a little.  You might break the glass.  Just be sure you have someone or 
something on the outside to catch the window, or else you will have a real 
mess.

To install, I get a piece of 16 gauge insulated wire.  Get the kind with 
strands of wire, not a solid piece (its more flexible).  The wire provides 
strength and the insulation provides a slick surface and keeps from damaging 
your newly painted window sills.  Put the rubber on the glass and then put 
the wire in the outer groove of the rubber.  The wire ends should come out 
at the bottom-center of the window because this is where you will start the 
insertion of the window.  I use liberal amounts of dish soap to help the 
rubber slide in easier.  Coat the inside edge and groove of the rubber with 
the soap.  Have a friend hold the glass up against the opening from the 
outside. Make sure the ends of the wire are on the inside of the opening. 
Start at the bottom-center.  Have the friend apply pressure while you work 
from inside. Gently pull in the wire, &quot;lifting&quot; the rubber over the window 
sill.  Work evenly along both ends of the wire working to the outside 
corners at an even rate.  I sometimes go a few inches in one direction and 
then do the same in the other.  The idea is to keep the window centered in 
the opening.  If you do all one side then the window will tend to slide to 
the other side and make it almost impossible to get the other side in (Ask 
me why I know this ;-).  As you work your way up the sides and around the 
top make sure your friend applies pressure directly opposite to where you 
are pulling.  This helps the rubber seat better.

I've done this on a half dozen windows and it now takes me about 5 minutes 
to put in a window in my bus (not including the windshield).  The trickiest 
part is holding on to the window and wire with soapy hands.  I use a pair of 
pliers to help me with the wire.  I have my friend wear leather or cloth 
gloves so as not to drop the window.

Hope this helps.  Let me know if you don't understand anything here.

As for the body work.  There are a few good books out there.  Make sure you 
remove ALL rust or else your work is in vain (ask me how I know this).  DO 
NOT use any of those rust converters you find at your neighborhood autoparts 
or hardware stores.  I have and the top coat of paint doesn't adhere well to 
them.  My favorite is POR-15 (www.por15_dot_com)  It seems to adhere extremely 
well.  I'll see if it lasts as long as they claim.  Top coats adhere to it 
just like metal.  It even fills in some of the small pits and holes.

This job is not really hard, just takes time.  Be patient and do it right 
the first time.  Other wise it's not worth doing.

I'm starting the project of removing all the windows, rust and dents from my 
'76 in the next year.  I'm sure I'll learn lots.
