&gt;Why is it that the vdo head temp goes to 600 (!!!), and the oil temp only
to 250?

The heads are the main source of heat for the oil.  Friction also heats the
oil, but the heads heat it the most.  The heads heat up (a lot) and the oil
transfers this heat away from the heads, through the engine, through the oil
cooler and then returns to the heads to continue this cycle.  This process
basically uses the oil (along with airflow) to cool the heads and will
always result in higher head temps than oil temps.
