&gt; Has anyone ever attempted to rebuild the seats in their bus?  I don't mean
&gt; simply new padding and covers, but actually replacing broken springs, etc. to

&gt; on my old, tired out seats, and it made a big improvement, but I noticed that
&gt; a few of the springs on the seat bottom along the front edge and outer side
&gt; were broken, causing the seats to sag and not provide adequate support.  I
&gt; tried to patch the broken springs (these are the springs that look like &quot;s&quot;
&gt; stacked on top of each other) with some steel tube and light brazing, but it
&gt; didn't hold up for long.  The other day while at the fabric store I noticed
&gt; some spring material that looked almost the same, and probably would work just
&gt; fine.  I also just thought about replacing all the spring material in the seat
&gt; bottom with a big foam cushion.  Anyone have experience in this area?

I've replaced springs in my driver's seat with springs robbed from other
similar seats.  Works just great, and the &quot;new/used&quot; springs seem to last
very well.  I guess it's survival of the fittest!
