Jed,

If you paint the engine BLACK, it will dissipate heat better, and therefore
run cooler, and therefore with more power.

Check your shrouds. I don't see the familiar round - the one that looks
similar to the cooling fan, and goes round-and-round.

Also, I hear the rat-pack motors are only good for around 10K before they
start dropping, er, droppings.

If all else fails, just tear the thing apart, piece by piece, until you find
a faulty part.

Poor Jed, whose VW runs like rat crap, sez:
