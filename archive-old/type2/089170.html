Subject: Re: [T2] Side window swap

[...]

&gt; I have a 68 Westy, what is the problem (other than keeping it stock)
&gt; with replacing the rear side passenger window with a 70 window.
&gt; Reason is to have a vent wing for my kids in the back seat. I have
&gt; access to lots of junk yard busses with these window. Any
&gt; suggestions as to where to buy seal?

VW never put a vent window in the rear section of a bus with the sliding door
on the same side.
Guess what would happen if you had it open and then you opened the sliding
door?
You will also notice that the vent window in the sliding door has a stop in it
to prevent it from opening more than 1/3rd. If it opened to 90 degrees, it
would catch on the body.  The ones on the drivers side pivot all the way open.
But if you really want to do this..... get a vent window from a sliding door
and the glass and seal from the left rear side from another bus.
