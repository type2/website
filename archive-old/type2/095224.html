Subject: Re: [T2] bucket seats

Hi there,

I have seen seats from VW golfs, (My 73)  Chrysler Daytonas (Collie 
Corner's 77 &quot;Manana), corvettes (Ted Finesman's 71) and Hyundai's (Adam 
Narraway's 68 westy) work fine in a bus.

http://www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/VW_type2/Vw-seats.jpg shows the golf seats I 
had in my 73 westy. They even had 12V heat!!! They were found at 
roadside in front of a local W/C VW shop.

Collie's seats are here:

You have to be willing to fabricate the mounting brackets to hold the 
seat base (and sometimes backrest) in place, but if you're willing to 
modify the bus to meet your needs your spine and gluteous maximus will 
surely thank you.

Happy trails,
