Subject: Propane heater

Sorry forgot to ask in my last post. What kind of
propane heater would be good to use while your
camping? I was looking at the MR HEATER PORTABLE BUDDY
PROPANE HEATER, does anybody else use this? Or if any
other heaters to look at, let me know.
P.S. I will buy a CO detector.
Thanks
