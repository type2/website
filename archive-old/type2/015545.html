Standard procedure, particularly on the later electronic ignitions, is to
ground the coil HT wire to give the spark a path. On Kettering systems, I
have never seen a coil damaged by no place for the spark to go. And I've
seen cars where one spark plug wire has been left ajar for who knows how
many miles and still no damage. Not saying it can't happen, just that I've
never seen it. The only failures of coils on Kettering systems I can recall
have all been due to coorosion of the terminals, ie, lack of maintenance.
