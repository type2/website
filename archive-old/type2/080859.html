Bob,

I switched my 1600 SP to a doghouse shroud with all the appropriate duct =
work etc. when I needed a new engine.  I bought my rebuilt engine with =
new pistons and cylinders from a VW yard and parts place I've gotten =
many parts from and trust completely.  I got the doghouse shroud with =
working flaps and proper duct work (including good original &quot;Hoover&quot; =
piece), installed oil cooler, and front (front is front) tin with the =
cutout for the doghouse ducting from a bug.  As the bus front tin is a =
'71 one-year-only piece and the guy I bought it from didn't have one, he =
gave me the bug tin and a regular '68-'70 front tin to make a good bus =
front tin for the doghouse cooler.  The difference is an additional =
piece of tin along the top that makes the more oval top profile of the =
bug tin fit the more square top bus profile (it makes sense if you see =
it).  All I had to do was drill out the spot welds on the old bus tin, =
position the top part of that properly on the bug tin, drill holes and =
rivet the two together.  A few touches with the grinder, some sand =
blasting and a fresh coat of paint makes it like new.  Personally I =
thought this was easier than trying to cut a hole in the '68-'70 bus tin =
and get it lined up correctly.  Also, if I remember correctly, I think =
there was a seam or some other feature in the non-doghouse bus tin that =
I thought would make it harder.  I did all this about 2 years ago, and =
have not had problems since.

As far as results analysis, I can't really say.  I didn't have an oil =
temp gauge prior to the new engine an cooler, so I can't claim any =
difference.  I do, however, notice that it takes a very long time for my =
oil temp to get over 200 F with a VDO dipstick sender.  On a 9 mile =
drive to work on the hottest days, I'll just reach 200-210 F.  On long =
highway drives I stay steady at about 220 on almost 100 F days at about =
60-65 mph. =20

What would I do differently?  I would have taken the opportunity to =
repaint the rest of my tin.  Otherwise, nothing else.  I would note, =
though, that I rarely take my bus on long drives; mostly it's something =
I enjoy working on and use as a utility vehicle around town. =20

I needed a new engine and with what I learned about the #3 cylinder =
cooling issue and non-doghouse engines, it made sense to take the =
opportunity to switch.  I think the design change was a good one by the =
VW engineers; it should have been done from the beginning of the air =
cooled engine.  In the end, it was worth the investment and effort, in =
my opinion.

Hope this helps you make your decision.
