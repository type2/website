Subject: Cleaning Westy Top

Greeting VW lovers,
        Recently I saved a 72 westy fron underneath a tree, the westy interior
is in great shape and the body is solid, but the engine had dropped a
valve (still need to a new one)
        So far I have remove the top but left the canvas attached to it.  Both
the top and luggage rack had blank gunk imbeded in the fibers. I
SCRUBBED the rack with bleach and it sort of became white again. So now
for some questions:
        1: What is best to clean the pop-top with (bleach)?
        2: Would it be better to sand it down using say, wet 220 grit?
        3: If I sand what should I do after to the fiberglass (leave alone,
paint, wax)?
        4: Is it ok to leave the canvas on the top of should i take it off
        5: What should I clean the canvas with, It still seems to have a strong
water            repelent?
Thanks Tim
