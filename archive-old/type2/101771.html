Subject: My new tires and repainted wheels pics

Hello List,

Well, as a Christmas present from my dad, he gave me
money to buy some tires for my bus. I bought the YKS
SV-820 185R14C (LRD) tires from a friend of mine who
was able to get me a deal. ($62 a piece mounted and
balanced with tax)I also took the time to repaint my
wheels, first with POR 15 grey and then POR 15
whitecote. They turned out really well. I mounted them
today. These are pretty beefy tires. Thier max load is
1875lbs a piece at 60psi. I shouldn't have any
stability or handling problems with them but I imagine
that they would make for a bumpy ride. An acceptable
trade off. The 5th wheel has one of my old tires on
it. It is a passanger tire that has a max rating of
around 1200lbs. I am using it as a spare. I really
should't use it at all for my bus but it did not cost
me anything extra. Anyway, here is the Links.

I am sorry there are so many. It wouldn't let me have
the entire albumn in one hyperlink. Any way, I have a
set of Gabriel shocks in the mail that I am going to
install soon. I got them on clearance for $20 a pair!
Have a great day!

P.S. I haven't forgotten about the one month late
&quot;christmas presents&quot;. I will have the rest of them in
the mail some time soon. Sorry. Other things got in
the way.
