They're all in Fayetteville, AR. I see 5-6 a week. Okay, maybe that's not
ALL of them.

BTW, got a call from a guy today with a good 70-71 body for $300. Name is
Duerr at 501 521-3109.

Have fun! Joe

&gt;&gt; Here in Indiana, where rust runs rampant, you RARELY see a splittie. In
&gt;&gt; fact, I can't remember the last time I saw one!

&gt;
&gt;Ditto Illinois.  Except for NEATO people I know, I haven't seen a
&gt;split on the road here for 10 years, minimum.  Off the
&gt;road...probably just as long.
