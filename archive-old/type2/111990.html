&gt; Sorry to report, I have given up on fitting a later model steering gearbox
&gt; to my 70 bus. There are too many issues regarding fit to resolve, in my
&gt; opinion. Aside from the bolt holes not lining up, the body of the box
&gt; interferes with the body of the bus enough to prevent it from fitting in
&gt; properly. I was very disappointed after buying a new TRW box, a Pitman arm
&gt; and a new Pitman arm nut, but I have faced reality and shelved the project.
&gt; My original box is now back in, torqued in and finished.

Could you elaborate on the interference?  Is it the &quot;neck&quot; of the box
interfereing with the hole in the frame member, or is the box hitting some
other item?

As time goes on, early bay boxes will become even more rare, and they
won't be any more robust than they are now.  Eventually, we'll have to
make the late box fit!
