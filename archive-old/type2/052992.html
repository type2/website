&gt; I know we've had this conversation a few times, but what tranny oil &quot;BRAND&quot; 
&gt; do you all use.  I found a GL 4 at GI Joe's in Oregon but I've never heard 
&gt; of the brand, and the store isn't a huge chain either.

Since all transmission oil is made to a specification, it really doesn't
matter what brand you get.  Same goes for motor oil.  

I tend to avoid the
&quot;no-name&quot; brands for the fear that they will not meet spec regardless of
what is on the bottle.  However, there is no magic to specific brands.

The exceptions are the specialty oiis like redline.  These claim to exceed
the specs, but you pretty much have to take that on faith.
