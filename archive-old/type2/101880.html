Subject: Re: [T2] Snow tires...was[T2] re: Tire twist

BFG 27X8.5X14 T/A KO's. Load range C. Absolutely the best frigging tire you 
will ever put on a bus or Vanagon. These things don't just laugh at snow, 
they give it the finger. Totally capable of eating small economical cars 
alive. Makes SUV/Wanna be off-roaders take notice and flash you a &quot;thumbs 
up.&quot; They also give you more ground clearance and handle like a wet dream. 
Well worth the cost.
