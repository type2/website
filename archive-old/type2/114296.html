Subject: 30PICT on a dual-port manifold

I'll be switching from a single-port to a dual-port manifold on the rebuilt engine that's going into my '70 at the end of the month.  I can get a new 34PICT carb, which is stock for the dual-port setup, or I can keep my 7-year-old 30PICT and use the adapter, at about a tenth the cost.  Opinions?

Thanks a bunch.

See you on the road,
Jerry
