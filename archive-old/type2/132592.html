Subject: Re: [T2] Serious Oil Leak from the filler tube???

Hi Jason,

The dipstick gasket is in excellent condition... I now think the leak 
is coming from either the filler tube joint or from where the filler 
tube bolts to the engine.

Tonight I will replace the filler tube and take it for a highway run, 
and we'll see what happens.

Happy trails,

&gt; greg, can you tell if the little accordian piece that seals the dip
&gt; stick from the filler tube assembly to the case is in good shape? that
&gt; thing is pretty low and can easily cause a nice leak if not in good
&gt; shape.
