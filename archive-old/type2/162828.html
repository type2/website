Subject: RE: [T2] tyre life

&gt;Yeah, but that is only true if you own a Vauxhall lorry. :)

	No such thing  -  Vauxhall is the Brit car firm bought up by 
GM, whose Brit lorries are branded Bedford.

&gt;
&gt;Seriously, that is what team Discovery's mechanic does with the teams'
&gt;bicycle tire tubes.  Their mechanic stores them in an old wine cellar.  Lance
&gt;Armstrong won all his tours on tubes no less than 2 years old!

	He must have heard from our old taxi driver.
	To make a tyre last double or treble the mileage is a 
considerable economy.  You pay the price of less grip than the rubber 
gives when new.
	But these are relatively fat tyres, and radial, so the 
footprint is pretty large.

&gt;
&gt;I think I'll use new tires so I can use the warranty.

	That is a point.
