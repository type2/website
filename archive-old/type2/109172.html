Subject: &quot;L&quot; &amp; &quot;R&quot; profile key blanks?

So there's an &quot;L&quot; and an &quot;R&quot; profile key blank?  Not sure what those are.

My `77 bay has the keys with the offset head on them; sort of an &quot;L&quot; shape
if you hold them upside down.  I found a plentiful supply of blanks at a
local locksmith, Dixie Lock &amp; Safe in Martinez, GA.  The &quot;van&quot; key fob that
I made was designed around the key shape of my bus' key.

BTW, the key fob is in it's 3rd week of field testing and going strong.
Casting them in colored resin turned out to be far superior to painting
them, though a connoisseur might be tempted to paint the fob to match their
own vehicle's paint scheme (a glass-hard clear coat is going to be mandatory
for painted fobs, though).

The cool thing is that setting the fob on it's &quot;wheels&quot; allows the key to
slightly lift the front of the fob up, mimicking something that my own bus
does when everyone gets out.  You can even bob the fob up and down on its
&quot;front suspension&quot;. :O)

... and it's a great conversation piece when folk ask what I do for a
living.  &quot;I'm a toymaker.  This is one of the things that I've done.&quot;
Response: &quot;Wow!  That's really neat.&quot;  {Waiting for a beautiful, single,
interested, Christian woman to say those words... sigh...}
