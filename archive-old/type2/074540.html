&gt; I have my eye on a 1978 Westy. Auto Trans,
&gt; 124,000 miles, a bit of surface rust and a 
&gt; couple of small holes in the fiberglass camper 
&gt; top that look like they can be patched.

got a 78 auto tranny.

124k miles or is that 224k, or 324kmiles on it???

however assuming 124k miles on it, that is approaching engine rebuild
time, consider the type IV 2liter engine (which is what should be
there) has a usefull life that is usually somewhere in the area of 150k
miles unless it was well taken care of.

unless abused the auto tranny should be fine 

&gt; I can pick it up for $1,200. It sounds like a
&gt; deal to me. Any advice will be greatly 
&gt; appreciated.

if you like it and throw in the fact that you will probably need a rebuild
on the engine shortly (about $ 2000 or so)

check the tranny this way.

. pull tranny dip stick, all the way in the front of the engine
compartment on the left side, below the double relay
. smell the tranny fluid, shouldn't smell burned, should be clear purplish
(unless synthetic, ask first, it always smells burned right out of the
bottle and is usually blackish)
. put engine in drive and on slight upgrade.
. push throttle to about 1/2-2/3 at about 12-18mph it should shift up to
second, around 35-40 it will shift up to third.   allow to drift back down
to under slight throttle, should shift back down 30-35 and again at about
10-15
  shifts should be smooth and almost detectable. shifting into drive or
reverse from neutral or park might clunk especially if the decel valve has
been disconnected or removed (which is common) this is not a problem.
  
lots of info on Westy and engine in archives and library, Dr Tim has
posted a detailed buying guide...remember this is an ideal and unlikely to
be found, but consider the more you find the better the van. and the
higher the cost.

consider, is this van worth $ 3,500 (cost + engine rebuild + the little
things they all need)

probably a fair price, but not the deal of the century, if you like it and
think you will enjoy living with it, go for it.
