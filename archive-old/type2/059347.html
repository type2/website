Subject: warmitup and icingit

list - thanks for all the input concerning my bogging bus...i think the overwhelming conclusion is an icing problem, as others have related similiar problems w/the weber progressive setup. however, i have yet to hear a plausible setup for warming the manifold, as the 2.0 obviously has no heat risers. seems there's no practical way to recapture exhaust-warmed air other than robbing the heater box output, which i'm considering. has anyone done this? any thoughts on if this would be adequate when blowing directly over the manifold, or should the warm air be fed directly into the carb? 

incidentally, i had no intention of stirring up such a heated debate (pardon the pun) concerning warmup...seems kinda silly in MHO. if you really love your bus, you'll know when it's ready to roll. 

thanks again for letting me pick your collective brain...
