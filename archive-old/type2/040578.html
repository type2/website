&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; My wife took our 74 VW Westfalia (her daily driver) into Midas today to get
&gt; the brakes inspected.  Midas said it needed new rotors on the front brakes,
&gt; no big deal.

That was the first mistake.  Midas has a very bad habit of making work
where there is no work required.  I'd be very surprised if they ever
looked at a car and didn't recommend turning/replacing the drums and
rotors.  That's how they can afford to give lifetime replacements on the
pads.
 
&gt; But they got her really spun up about the &quot;half-shaft.&quot;  The mechanic was
&gt; alarmed about the level of play in the shaft.  I checked it and it wasn't
&gt; bad according to Muir.  No play forward and backward, plenty of play side to
&gt; side.  (You guys will probably remember me asking you questions trying to
&gt; figure out a noise, which we all think are the wheel bearings and loose axle
&gt; nut).  Anyway, the mechanic went on to say that the cv joints were shot and
&gt; that it was grinding knuckles away.  I have no idea what grinding knuckles
&gt; away means.  Has anyone ever had to actually replace the large metal axle?
&gt; How can I chase this down (I promised her I would consult with the experts
&gt; on the list before dismantling our beloved bus)?

They're blowing smoke.  &quot;grinding knuckles&quot; has no meaning on a VW.
&quot;Knuckle&quot; is a vague term relating to old-fashioned universal joints.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll probably go ahead and replace the cv joints (about due according to
&gt; maintenance schedule).  Does the price quoted for CV Joints usually include
&gt; the joint next to the tire and the one at the transaxle per side?  Or am I
&gt; looking at buying 4 joints?

If the joints aren't bad, then don't replace them.  I have one joint on my
bus that has over 200K miles on it and still works well.  There's no way
that you can predict the life of a CV
 
Bus CV joints are priced per joint, with four joints installed.  All four
are identical.  You don't get a new shaft with the joints.

&gt; While I have the CV Joints apart, would this be an opportune time to go
&gt; ahead and replace the wheel bearings?

It's a good time to spin the wheel and feel for rough bearings.  If they
are rough, replace them.  If not, add some grease (via a needle) and leave
them alone. 

&gt; Really appreciate the help.

First thing to do is to get your bus away from Midas.  Find a decent
mechanic who diagnoses what is wrong, not what is most profitable.
