Subject: Re: POR 15 Corrosion Control Process

It also sounds critical of those who choose to go that way.
This thread sorta started because someone who 'wasn't' a professional
wanted to clean up their rims. (The first POR 15 mention) and then
again with fixing a spot by the windshield. I was tempted at that time
to mention that it did a really nice bangup job for me but felt sorta
'detuned' since I wasn't a professional and it should be done right.

Guess the tone of the conversation didn't invite me to comment
but I did later anyway. I'm guessing most people on the list (s) don't
have a professional shop or work on anyone's vehicles but their own.

I guess my response was to the tone of the message, I think everyone
would like to have a mint, awesome bangup job on their vans but it's
not always an option. Another thing is.. have you used the POR 15
product and seen how it works? Or just seen the ads and said..
'another snake oil product' ?

J
I'm really not trying to start a flamer.. just want to say that
your messages have that 'my way or the highway, everything else
is wrong' tone

*************
So--with this in mint--the Slick 50 of the body work profession is just
a temporary band aide--and not the final solution.

If this stuff worked out for your quest for an OK quick fix job --great.

The stuff is just a back yard cave and pave job, and I wouldn't never
use it on any client's vehicles--nor would any other body shop--

( Not that I am aware of anyway )

This says a bunch---
