Subject: Re: New front brake discs/squeal

Bruce and the List:

I'm going to dismantle and thoroughly clean the front discs and pads this 
week.  I have located anti-squeal shims at Bow Wow Auto Parts in Seattle 
(they handle many VW parts).  They're pricey; about $11.00 each (yikes!!!)  
I'm going to reapply the anti-squeal goo before spending another $40+.

You can find Bow Wow at http://www.bowwowvw_dot_com/.

I'll let everyone know how how my project turns out.  Thanks to everyone who 
responded with suggestions.

I tried to find these elusive &quot;anti-squeal shims&quot;;  no luck.

&gt;Please let me (and the list) know if you find a source for those shims.  
&gt;VWOA apparently doesn't stock them.
&gt;
&gt;good luck.
