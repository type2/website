&gt; Why would you *need* to use the parking brake to hill-start the car if you
&gt; have an automatic transmission?

Remember that the forward &quot;thrust&quot; of an automatic with your foot off the
gas is only as much as is provided by the idling engine, minus the loss in
the torque converter.  On a sufficiently steep hill, an automatic will drift
backwards when you take your foot off the brake, until you give it enough
throttle to counter gravity's pull.  No danger of stalling out, of course,
but you do need to make the brake-to-throttle transition fairly quickly or
use the handbrake to avoid rolling.

Anyone with an automatic bus had to worry about this in hilly areas?

Cheers,
Alistair
