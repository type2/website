Subject: Re: [T2] windsheild installation

We just wrapped the rope around twice. We used curtain rod rope. First time around got the seal over the lip, the second time around seats it better and rarely we use a plastic knife to coax the rubber into place. 

We can get a window instialled in about 20 minutes. Most of that is getting the seal on the glass, getting rope into the groove, and using lube on seal if we want that for that application. 

Somehow it is very satisfying still to see that seal get pulled into place in the window opening...
