Subject: Re: fuel injection trouble after engine swap

Hi Eddie, I had a similar problem when I did the same switch, from carbs to  
the stock FI.
 
My problem was with the AFM fuel pump contact switch.  
 
This is a picture and the red arrow shows where it needed to be bent since  
it was contacting the counterweight.

Hopefully for you it is that simple!
 
Good luck!
