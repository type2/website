Subject: cool and fragrant

ahhh. changed out the lower right front wheel cylinder, adjusted and test
driven for 30+ minutes and both hubcaps and rims are the same temp. prolly
will re-adjust before the next fill up. the big crying shame was two trips
to the parts store because i forgot shoes. mostly had that 71 sunroof to
look at on the same trip and had that on my mind. otherwise, before
bleeding i recommend installing the bleeder valve. if not for the other
wheel to stop the stream i'da squirted fluid into the next county. new
cylinders will never always come with valves. what a maroon. now back to
the saga of will the 1.8l get back into the westy. our third baby is due i
mid-january, and i'm not sure which will be completed first.

a friend recommended placing a homemade .005 paper shim between the crank
and the flywheel, and make up the difference with the three metal shims.
this is due to the slag humps up on the front end of the crank. the
flywheel has equal divits - as if metal was pulled away from the flywheel
in some kinda stuck-then-separated metal mess fusion. i wish i'd noticed
that while the crank was out. any thoughts on this effort? can we get a
judgement on this?  i tried chunking the slag off with a putty knife to no
avail. i'm apprehensive about taking a grinding tool to it, but can be
persuaded if that's the correct route to take. chisel? all notions deeply,
truly, madly appreciated.  - steve
