&gt;Can you remove the fan housing without pulling the engine? I've been told
&gt;you couldn't... Maybe that's just the upright engine.
&quot;No&quot; on the upright, and &quot;nearly no&quot; on the pancake...
The exhaust has to come off along with the heater boxes..the bottom of the fan
housing is cupped in the heater boxes..(you *could* just kinda bend and twist
the boxes...ow..) the alternator and bracket, the dipstick tube boot...ugly,
ugly job....*can* be done and is a toss-up time-wise....but *please* check the
sender unit..they leak *all* the time......If you pull the shroud or the
engine to find out that the sender was the problem..cries of anguish will fill
the night...(DO *NOT* ask how I know this......)
