Subject: Re: A new click heard from...

What?? This isn't normal?? I thought all buses had a click! ;-)
Really though...Stella has a little click too when I turn the wheel to the
left.  She also clunks something horrible on the front passengers side as her
ball joints are absolutely shot.  Maybe they're related and your ball joints are
going too??  I wouldn't worry too much about it Ted.  Stella made it all the way
to Detroit and back without any hassle.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; Climbed in my bus this morning , turned the steering wheel about 1/4 turn
&gt; and heard a click. Turned it back the other direction and heard the same
&gt; click,
