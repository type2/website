Subject: Re: Confused! 20w50? 15w40? 10w30? ACK!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Could you please look it up at home and post or send it to me. 72 Westy
&gt;&gt;&gt;w/1800 Mark Stephens rebuild that I do not want to fry. They recommended
&gt;&gt;&gt;20W-50 but this isn't California and I don't think it will give me the cold
&gt;&gt;&gt;protection I need.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;        Tell ya what. It's in the form of a graphic, so I'll scan it at
&gt;&gt;school tomorrow and post it on my web page. I'll let you know when it's
&gt;&gt;done...

        It's done. The Bentley '68-'79 type II manual's words regarding
grades of oil can now be found at my website. You can link from my home
page &lt;http://ccwf.cc.utexas_dot_edu/~ehintz/&gt;, or go directly to the oil faq
page &lt;http://ccwf.cc.utexas_dot_edu/~ehintz/oilfaq.html/&gt;. The page includes
the graphic showing climate/oil grade relationships, and the text
concerning it. Hope this helps stem the tide of oil questions...

Peace,
