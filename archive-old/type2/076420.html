Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield



&gt; Any advice on this? &gt;... Also, when my windshield was replaced I was told
there was a lot of rust in  the body.  I hear this is common.

Great time to get a mig welder and a Makita grinder.  Also a sandblaster.
Not as hard as you'd think.  If it is seriously holey, then maybe a patch
panel is advisable.  For holes of about nickel size, you can cut little
patches with tin snips, and tack a piece of coat hanger on to use a s a
handle for positioning.  Flap discs in the Makita give you a beautiful
smooth surface.  Finish with a hand file.

Regards,

Grant
