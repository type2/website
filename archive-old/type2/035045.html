Subject: Major engine problems (Long...)

I recently rebuilt a 2.0L type IV engine for my '75 camper van.  After only about 30,000 
miles, I had a fire in the engine compartment (yes, it is fuel injected).   The mechanic 
suggested installing a webber progressive carb because it was cheaper than fixing the fuel 
injection. Two months and $1000 later I got it back, but it ran like sh*t.   I then took it to 
another mechanic (wasn't at all happy with the &quot;VW Specialist&quot;) to have the carb adjusted 
only to find out that I now have a major compression leak around the heads. 

It seems no matter how much money or time I put into this thing, I can't keep it going.   It 
has always seemed terribly underpowered also, even with a fresh rebuild.  The old lady says 
get rid of it so we can get a Vanagon camper because it will be more reliable, get better gas 
mileage (we travel a lot), and has a real heater.

Here are some of my questions:
	How many miles should I expect from a 2L Type IV?
	Could I retrofit a Vanagon engine in my Type 2?
	Would the Vanagon engine be an improvement?
	How about installing an american V6 (or similar)?
	Can I get an engine that can maintain the speed limit going uphill?
	How reliable is the Vanagon compared to a Type 2?
	What is going to be the most cost effective solution?
	Does anyone want to buy an ASI camper van with a very clean (99% rust free) body? 

I don't have a lot of money to sink into this thing.  I've already spent over $4,000 and it still 
doesn't run.   Maintenance and break-downs are killing me.  I love the VW camper style, but 
it doesn't do me any good if it won't go anywhere.

Any advice or comments are appreciated.

Burned by VW love,
