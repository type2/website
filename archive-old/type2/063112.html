I used to Have a giant &quot;COKE&quot; sign, like a big red button with white
letters..about three feet in diameter mounted on the front of my split window
'66.  Everywhere I went, children and adults would run to the street shouting
&quot;its the real thing.&quot;  It was fun and somehow I got the vicarious idea that I
was the real thing too.  (the real &quot;what&quot;  I don't know)
