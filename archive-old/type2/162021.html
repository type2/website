Subject: Vacuum Hose Configuration for 1973 Bus w/ Dual-Carbs?

Hi there!

I'm a new member to the list, and a proud new owner of a 1973 Camper,
with a dual-carb 1700cc engine (CB).

Unfortunately, it appears that the bus was mistreated and needs lots of
work. My first puzzle is to solve is the proper vacuum hose
configuration. Some hoses are missing and some are clamped off, so I
know something is wrong.

I believe I have solved the fuel vapour recovery system and the oil
breather hose configuration. But,
here are all the connectors I'm worried about:

A	Vacuum advance on Distributor, Cone Side
B	Vacuum advance on Distributor, Flat Side
C	Left Carb, Pointing rear and outward
D	Left Carb, Pointing forward and inward
E	Right Carb, Pointing rear and outward
F	Air Cleaner, Black Plastic
G	Air Cleaner, Bronze
H	Vacuum cut-off, Cone Side
I 	Vacuum cut-off, Flat Side with electrical connectors

My questions:

1. Which connectors go to which?
2. Is it bad that the vacuum cut-off isn't hooked up (neither electrical
nor vacuum)?
3. I have an odd number of connectors listed, am I missing one or is
there supposed to be a T connector?
4. Bonus Question: If I were to switch to the 009 distributor, what is
the new configuration?

Thanks for your help!
