I'm gonna reply to both of these posts:

&gt;I guess I will ask the question that seems to stick in the back of my mind.
&gt;Does ANYONE out there have and regularly use the A/C in their bus?

I do.

&gt;How long
&gt;have you used it, and under what conditions; temps, hills, etc.?

This is my third summer using it.  I use it regularly when the outside
temperature is above about 80 degrees (this is when it begins to get
uncomfortable, even with the windows down and I don't like arriving at work
stinky).  In Dallas, this is from about May through October.  Humidity here
makes it seem hotter than it really is - in the desert my threshold is
closer to 90.  There are not many hills here in Dallas, but when I travel
to hilly places I don't turn off the A/C, I just slow down slightly.

&gt;I have
&gt;never heard of anyone expressing such a thing.  Can it be done?

Of course!

&gt;Now that the lovely desert temperatures are approaching 110 degrees, I'm
&gt;beginning to notice a pretty large difference between the readings of the
&gt;cyl head and oil temp on my 82 aircooled westy.  The oil sensor is
&gt;sump-mounted.  My cyl head temp never goes above 225, but hte oil temp gauge
&gt;sometimes will read at close to 280.

Where do you have the CHT sensor mounted?  It's hard to get useful readings
out of those things because they don't fit around the plug very well, which
is where you get the best readings.  CHT will almost always be higher than
oil temp.  Only exception might be when you begin to coast down the other
side of a big hill that you just crested.

&gt;I have a feeling that it may not be
&gt;wired correctly, as it tends to fluxuate with the dimmer switch for
&gt;headlights, but i still think it is running a bit hot.

Sounds like it!  I would attempt to verify the gauge as soon as possible.

&gt;The van has an
&gt;aftermarket a/c from PO, which I have not used as I haven't been able to
&gt;locate the dumb little belt for it.

I found it at the VW dealer, believe it or not.

&gt;Will the cutout on the tin for the
&gt;compressor cause this high temp?

I seriously doubt that this one thing could cause the temp to get so
abnormally high.  It probably contributes though.  You might try sealing it
up with some weatherstripping.

&gt;I would like to run the a/c, but if it is
&gt;going to mean overheating problems and limited reliability, I will scrap the
&gt;a/c and replace the tin, rather than risk breaking down.

Running with A/C will just remove 1-5hp from your engine.  If you drive a
little slower than you would otherwise to compensate, you won't kill your
engine any faster!  A/C killing aircooled engines is a myth perpetuated by
people who think they can still put the pedal to the metal with the air on
high.

&gt;Would an aux
&gt;cooler help?

Probably, but plumbing one is not a simple task and will cause a lot of
trouble if not done right.
