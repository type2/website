Subject: [T2] Couple of questions

When does the fan, going to the heater boxes, decide to come on in a 72 with
a 1700- dual solex carbs?  Sometimes it's on, sometimes not.  Should I try
and wire it to be on whenever the engine is running?

I'm picking up a 79 Westy Deluxe, through a friend of Scott Solomon's,
(thanks Scott!) and it's missing the built in battery recharger that fits
under the bed and has a port on the outside of the bus.  It seems to all be
missing.  Is it hard to find a replacement and does this support dual
batteries?

The deck lid topic bouncing around is of interest to me as I can't close the
rear lid after being rear ended recently.  Should getting my engine
compartment (engines fine) pulled back out again be a high priority?

TIA
