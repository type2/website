Hey listemembers!

Well, I sold the first bus I ever owner, the 75 standard hotwheel edition, 
and I hate myself for it.
But, I needed to, because I bought a 76 westfalia and needed both the money 
and space. I have only had the 76 since it has been pretty ugly out and I 
have not done much with it yet, and was figuring out all the little toys and 
such.

Does my passenger seat swivel? If so, how?
It doesn't have a back to it, like the 75 did, so it makes sense, I just 
don't really understand how to swing it around.

ahhh, its nice dealing with such little things like this.

Christopher
76 westfalia - needs a name still.
