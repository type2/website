&gt; First, I feel not a little silly for posting this to the list(s).
&gt; 
&gt; The type2 list and the vintagebus list are tribal cultures. They are not
&gt; democracies. The charter made that clear. It also made clear that
&gt; competence and experience are prized by the tribe, whereas lack of
&gt; competence and experience are tolerated. This is a tribe that has tribal
&gt; elders: Bob Hoover, Joel, Ken, George Lyle among others. It even has a
&gt; brilliant if eccentric 'elder' in Clara. If the actions
&gt; of newbies drive them away, as they have driven Bob Hoover away, then the
&gt; list dissolves.
&gt; 
&gt; The list also has an initiation process for newbies. If a newbie
&gt; misbehaves, he or she will get a slap on the wrist. The slap is in
&gt; proportion to the behavior, measured by values of the tribe.
&gt; 
&gt; If this all sounds a little &quot;fascistic,&quot; get over it or go away.
&gt; 
&gt; Please.

Well said, and I think most agree. I really don't know why that thread
on vintagebus wasn't killed right when it started. I'm sorry to say that
from what I've seen from reading it on findmail, that list looks worse
than the newsgroup right now.

and since I don't subscribe to vintagebus, I'm not even going to bother
trying to send it there, it will never get there anyway.
