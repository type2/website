Subject: Re: [T2] Couple of air circulation questions

I've been broken into thru both vents, bending the latch so the vent does 
not close completely and creating the wind noise.
I made a small wooden wedge for each side, it fits between the latch and the 
frame, below the raised part of the frame. No more noise, but I find that I 
no longer use the vents cuz it's too much trouble to fiddle w the wedges 
while driving.
Best wishes

Over the long life of these buses, entry has been many times and easily I
might add, with a coat hanger through the vent window. The subsequent damage
makes it impossible to get the correct seal of the vent window.

Result.......wind noise at speed.

The ONLY solution is to replace the entire window and seals. Then it will
fit tight like it did when new.

&gt;
&gt;I am going camping this evening after work. I will have my passenger look
&gt;into this. It is driving me nuts as well. Last night I had my passenger
try
&gt;to isolate the noise and she thought it was the door seal, but I am not so
&gt;sure because the seal is in as good a shape as all the others and they
&gt;don't whistle. A few weeks ago someone broke into Possum and stole her
&gt;stereo, they got in via the vent window, perhaps damaged it then...

&gt; &gt;It definately seems like the whistling is coming from my vent wing window
&gt; &gt;or passenger door seal. What can be done about the vent wing window? It
&gt; &gt;looks like replacing the seals on that guy would be a PITA. Plus the
&gt;rubber
&gt; &gt;looks to be okay, not dry rotten at least.
&gt;
&gt;Hey, I think I have the same problem as you describe above.  The noise
&gt;seems to be coming from the passenger vent wing, but I have found that I
&gt;can reduce/eliminate the squealing by rolling the passenger window down
&gt;ever so slightly.  Not enough that there is even a gap, but so that the
&gt;window is not quite all the way up in the channel.  By any chance does
&gt;yours react the same way?  If so, at least we could be fairly sure we have
&gt;the same problem.  It's driving me absoultely nuts!  All I can think of to
&gt;troubleshoot this is to start masking over certain areas with some wide
&gt;masking tape and see if the problem goes away.  I'm going to start with
the
&gt;
&gt;passenger vent wing, but I haven't had time to start on it yet.  Please
let
&gt;
&gt;me know if you find a solution.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;-David
