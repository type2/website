&gt;	You could have geneally worn lifters, that make noise when
&gt;   the engine is accelerating.  But worn lifters will usually
&gt;   leak down overnight, so I'd expect you'd hear this noise
&gt;   in the morning, while idling after start up, until they
&gt;   pumped up.

Are we saying that my lifters shouldn't clatter like mad at start-up from
setting over night, everynight, even in 10 deg. F ?
