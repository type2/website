&lt;&lt;Hello all, 

I am presently waiting on my engine to get back from the machine shop,
and I am now looking to purchase a replacement clutch assembly, pressure
plate and throwout bearing.

In doing some price checking at some local franchise part stores, I keep
getting asked whether I have a bus made before Feb, 74 or after March 74.
 The Volks catalogs and websites that I'm checking don't mention anything
about a difference between buses made before or after Feb/March.  Has
anyone experienced this before, or are the franchise stores just
confused.

Also, I am having trouble figuring out what month my bus was made.  Does
anyone know where I can find this information, and if it's on the VIN#,
what do I need to look for?

Thanks
Jack&gt;&gt;

Jack,
The later '74 buses were switched to fuel injection.  I'm taking a wild guess 
here that the FI '74 would be the same as the '75, which I know uses a 
different flywheel.  If you have dual carbs, then you have the early model 
'74.
