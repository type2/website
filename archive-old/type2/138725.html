Subject: Cylinder head temp guage report

Just opened and tested my new CHT guage. Ordered it from Aircraft Spruce &amp;
Specialty. It's a Microflight CH001 with included sensor. For $49.95 +
shipping I think I got a useable product. Being about half the price of a VDO
guage I didn't know what to expect but I guess I am satisfied. I tested it
against 2 Thermometers on a heated block of steel. DEAD ON at 200, 300 and 400
deg. F. I am impressed. The only disapointment I have is it has no light of
its' own, but my VDO guages spill so much light behind them I don't think it
will be a problem. Also the guage feels light. But I guess with that little
meter movement it doesn't need to weigh much. For those of you who don't like
to support the Chinese Economy DON'T buy this guage. otherwise seems worth the
money invested

My question for the day:
Does anyone know where I can find a guage pod to house 3 or 4 guages on top of
the dash that is enclosed so you don't see the wires and connectors on the
back of the guage? seems the one Bus Boys used to sell is NLA. Isn't that the
way with all the cool old stuff?

Well once again, Thank to you all

The way things are going with all the little parts I need I might call it NLA
