Hey folks, am switching up to the 70amp alt. for my ' 78 Westy, and am having
one hell of a time locating the &quot;D&quot; shaped cooling boot. Anyone out there
know where I can lay my hands on one?

Try your local VW dealer.  I just bought a genuine, brand spankin new VW
boot for $15.78 from my dealer this week.  I had to order it and it took a
week to get it.  Call your dealer and ask for part no.021-903-655-D.  They
should be able to get it.  If not, let me know.
