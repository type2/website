	Talked with Mr Bauer this morning. (Bauer German, Berkeley, CA)
Having had some problems with idomatic English yesterday, I drew a picture
of the whole ignition system including back up lights so we could point.
I asked for 30 seconds time, showed him the picture and said, &quot;So where
was the problem you fixed exactly?&quot; 

	He pointed at the primary wire leading into the distributor from 
the coil. Then he took me over to the other gentleman who works there, 
also a nice guy, and pulled a pretty clean looking used distributor out of 
a bin of same at a bench. He pointed at the little insulated lug that 
connects the primary wire AND wire from the condensor to the points. 

	The insulator was MISSING when I brought in the truck! All they had 
to do was find an insulator and the little bracket that grabs it and install 
same. After Broadway VW had 'fixed' it, our 70 single cab had run ok as 
long as the UNINSULATED PRIMARY WIRE wasn't touching anything... as it warmed 
up, the wire insulation got softer and it eventually draped against the 
distributor, shorting the primary, and it died.

	SO! Whatever caused the bus to expire when I backed out of
the driveway originally had been fixed when Broadway VW replaced the
cap-rotor-points-condensor. Since they're a dealership, we'll never know
what was wrong, and at the highest possible labor rate :( In short,
they fixed it, but they didn't fix it right. And their wanting to
replace the 31PICT was simple foolishness. 

	(Just for reference, I bought this engine complete and outright,
the 31PICT came from ECI and looked new when I got it.)

	BUT the new condensor wiring they installed lacked the insulator 
and THAT DIDN'T BOTHER THEM!!!!! Yep, sent me out in the world with a hole 
in side of my distributor. Nice guys. I went back and told the service 
writer and will be writing a letter to the service manager. For $255 labor
(no kidding) they certainly should have installed the correct parts
correctly!

	So, when language fails in communicating with your mechanic,
draw pictures. I got my copy of Muir out of storage and read through
his won't start/run procedure and I'm fairly sure now that I would
have at least figured out I had a spark problem if I'd done the
turn-by-hand-and-watch-primary-spark test he describes. Oh well.
Next time. The blow was slightly softened by Jean's Toyota needing
a $500 alternator replacement... :(

	Thanks again for all your support.

	Bill
