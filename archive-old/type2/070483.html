&gt; Seems to me that buying stuff and paying money to keep from being
&gt; hassled by the police is a lot like paying protection to the mob.
&gt; Don't we already pay their saleries?

This is so full of truth it hurts--all of us.

The next issue of NEATO's &quot;Old Bus Review&quot; will include the tale
of my trip from Illinois to North Carolina to buy a '67 Westfalia
from Poor Richard.  What I cut from the 1,200 words of that
installment is the scene my wife and I encountered while in
Tennessee on the way to North Carolina.

We're in our 40s, driving an '84 Vangon GL with tools and a
tow-bar in the back.  Only bumper sticker is

&quot;I have an Honor Roll Student at DeKalb High School&quot;

Tennesse Trooper sees us during rush hour, going 65mph with
everybody else (in, admittedly a 55mph zone).  He's parked, we're
zipping by with in the middle of a herd of pickup trucks.  Next
thing I know, he's behind me, lights on.

(Aside, bragging, I have not had a moving violation since I
started driving in 1967.)

I figure it's time for a ticket, pull over and wait.  He walks
up, says &quot;Get out&quot;.  I do and we converse behind the van.

TT:  Where you headed?
ME:  North Carolina.
TT:  Why?
ME:  To buy a van (figuring &quot;bus&quot; wouldn't sink in).
TT:  I clocked you going 67.
ME:  OK.
TT:  I can show you on my radar.
ME:  I believe you.
TT:  This must be *some van* for such a long trip.
ME:  It's an old VW bus, I restore them.
TT:  You have your registration?
ME:  In the glove compartment, my wife can give it to you.
TT:  Stay here.

...(goes to passenger window)

TT:  He says registration is in glove compartment.
HER: Here it is.
TT:  Where you headed?
HER: Raliegh.
TT:  What for?
HER: To buy a '67 VW bus, my husband restores them.

...(comes back to me, satisfied with registration)

TT:  She says you're getting a *69* VW bus.
ME:  No, a '67.
TT:  Well, you know you were speeding.
ME:  Yes.
TT:  Stay under the limit.  Now get on your way.

(Me, sweating bullets, gets on my way, very paranoid.)

A recent post cited a (too obscure) document which started
&quot;Congress shall ...&quot; and went on to speak of unwarranted search
and seizure.  Call it digression, call if off-subject, but I
offer the following quotes from a recent book titled
_Smoke_and_Mirrors_ (The War on Drugs and the Politics of
Failure) as an example of the DEA &quot;profile&quot; of possible drug
runners.  It was written of suspicious airport situations, but
applies to VW bus drivers as well:

Walking slowly, walking quickly, being very tense, calm demeanor,
appearing &quot;cool&quot;...

Traveling alone, two or more people traveling together...

First to deplane, last to deplane, deplaning from the middle...

Attempting to leave the airport immediately by taxi, attempting
to use public transportation to leave the airport, using
limousine to leave airport, using hotel courtesy van, attempting
to leave airport in private vehicle...

The book concludes &quot;In other words, the DEA felt justified in
searching everybody.&quot;

So, in your VW bus, sticker or no sticker, driving quickly,
driving slowly (more likely), or leaving an airport is probable
cause on some issues.  *And* suspicion of having, transporting,
or indending to sell drugs would be grounds for forfeiture of
your VW, whether you were charged or convicted or not.  Of
course, in either case, you would have to sue to get your bus
back.

The entire sticker/probable cause thread is VW related, and VW
BUS related in particular.  This is not a subject which would be
going on at the lexus_at_primenet server.

I end with a quote from Mr. Dylan:
&quot;The moral of the story, the moral of the song
is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.&quot;

It's a sad commentary that while we feel we belong in our VW
buses, some believe that for that reason alone we belong in jail.
