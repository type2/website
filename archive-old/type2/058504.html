Subject: Pandora: We're Legal and Rolling

Getcher kids off the streets. 8)

Done:

	-- Got the 12V wipers installed and running. Real pure-D stock
	   Bosch wiper blades run $27 the pair at Roy Rogers, who seem
	   embarrased over it and ought to be. They offered Brazilian
	   ones at $3.50 but the tiny set screws on there would
	   hold for all of ten miles I reckon so I got the expensive
	   ones with the big freaking screws. I still have not dealt
	   with the switch problem and the switch is hanging from wires.

	-- Cleaned Pandora out. We're not done yet with this, I think
	   pressure wash is next. The problem is sticky red grit
	   endemic to north Oklahoma (ask Josh), it coats everything.

	-- Re-worked the cab windows. New rubber came with the bus,
	   installed all that and painted the frames. The available
	   evidence (Joe had the same problem) argues that the WCM
	   splitty cab window kits do not include the gasket that
	   isolates the vents wing glass from the frames. We tried
	   improvising with rubber from an inner tube but that didn't
	   hold the glass. Right now I'm experimenting with black
	   silicone. All this was incredibly time-consuming. It's
	   a good thing I don't have a job. 8)

	-- Adjusted the choke. This thing is a torment. When I picked
	   it up it wouldn't idle when cold. I can either have that,
	   or it won't idle when warm (not hot). I fuss with it almost
	   constantly, it is becoming an obsession. 34 PICT-3, dual
	   port, 009, yahda yahda yahda.

	-- Worked with the wiring, the usual corrosion problems. Buses
	   need to drive, if they are parked they ossify. If they are
	   parked for years they ossify a lot.

	-- Installed a hideous &quot;California&quot; truck mirror on the pass
	   side. It is huge and horrible and I violated the door with
	   thick sheet metal screws. But I drove it ~400 miles home and
	   couldn't see anything on the right side--now in addition to
	   the huge mirror there is a 4&quot; fisheye and we can see 180
	   degrees on that side like a housefly. It is not cool but
	   it is safe.

	-- Replaced some hub cap clips (do not get these from RMMW, they
	   suck) and fixed a hundred little things.

	-- Passed the notoriously arbitrary Memphis inspection. Compared
	   to the things that have happened in the border-crossing
	   threads, or one guy who was flunked by the Connecticut
	   gendarmes for having a dirty undercarriage, my tussles with
	   the Man don't amount to much so I won't dwell on it although
	   the net is the perfect medium for emabarrasing the despotic
	   so send me pmail if you have a good method to make the
	   border guards tone it down through public denunciation.
	   Anyway they tested the emissions of my 64 for some damn
	   reason so here are the numbers:


	   HC:

	      (Hoop)   162 PPM  (Allowable)  900 PPM

	   CO:

	      (Hoop)    4.26%   (Allowable)  8.90%

	-- Alone, without precedent, I wish to praise not only the PO
	   (the illustrious Chip Shaner who needs no introduction) but
	   also the PPO. PPOs are universally despised but Pandora's
	   knew what he was about. There are a ton of little things
	   that say &quot;nicely done&quot; even by listee standards which
	   tend to be high. A Randall Something of Stillwater,
	   Oklahoma. I don't have the paperwork anymore. Thanks
	   to both of you.

	-- No sane people are still reading. We sold the Honda, which
	   had 216K on it, to the first guy who showed up for $750
	   which was the asking price and was outrageous IMO.
	   Now we are a two-bus family. Well, three-bus, there is
	   still this 81 at Rex's house I have never seen. I hope
	   to get that one back here soon. My neighbors have been
	   remarkably indulgent so far and I'm told the 81 has
	   no body damage which makes it unique among my stable. 8)
