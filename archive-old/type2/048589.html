Subject: [T2] stove pipe preheater..

how much does the stove pipe tube help in warming the engine quicker on cold 
mornings? it is that j-shaped tube that goes through the rear tin and 
channels air from the cyls via a paper tube into the air-cleaner 
intake...and is cut off with a thermostat when engine is hot enough....my 71 
never had one on it but i was thinking about adding one with the frigids 
approaching...i think they were only on 68-71 buses, maybe bugs, too...
