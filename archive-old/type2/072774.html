''FACTS IS FACTS&quot;

I (as well as many other list users) spend a few thousand dollars a year on
VW parts, so this subject is quite interesting to me.  I want to know who
the good suppliers are and who are there just siphoning off your hard
earned money with no service at all.

I have not used Bus Depot as of yet (because of his now changed credit card
policy), but there are too many people on this list who support him
religiously for his company to be undiligent in trying to serve his
customers.  Maybe his success is starting to catch up with him, I don't
know, but I'd remind him to be careful and remember &quot;not to bite the hand
that feeds you&quot;.  As for RMMW, until this month I have had very good
service.  Early this month, though they sent me crap and called it a set of
main bearings.  They said they were having weather problems, but I'm
wondering if they've just become to arrogant for me to continue to trade
with them?

Price is important, but my first criterion is service and followthrough.

I've been trying to get parts and machine work done for 9 weeks now for a
spare engine I'm building and everybody seems to be screwing up.  What is
it....Y2K...The Millenium? I don't know, but nobody is getting it right!

Everybody!...  Take three breaths,  mellow out and try harder to do it right.

Please excuse the ramblings of a frustrated VW Bus spare time mechanic,

Have fun
