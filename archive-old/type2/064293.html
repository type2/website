Subject: My bus is breathing again...

        My bus has been saved...father dearest, whom I greatly thank for 
giving it life again, has fixed it.  We took the switcher/ignition from the 
parts bus, and switched it with my bus.  I am still not to clear as to 
what was wrong with it exactly, but alteast I can drive it again.
