Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line 

You need a fuel filter.  Normally it is _after_ the metal line, in the
engine compartment before the fuel pump. You don't need two.  Someone who
put the bus on a lift to change the oil may have thought it easier to access
the filter where you found it.

&gt; Hey All,
&gt; I am replacing the fuel line on 71.  About 2 ft from the tank, I had a
fuel
&gt; filter, then some line connected to the steel tube line.
&gt; Does this filter need to be there?  Or is it advised?
&gt;
&gt; TIA
