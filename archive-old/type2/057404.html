Subject: Flaps or No Flaps

As I posted yesterday, my engine is out of my 1970 Camper (1600SP) and I am
wondering about those fan shroud flaps (technical term).

What is the general opinion on keeping them or removing them?  I seem to
think that if they were off that it would be the same difference as keeping
them wide open, which would be a good thing.  I do not know the use of
having them closed...Preheating in winter months?  I won't be driving it in
the winter anyway.

Related to the flaps...I still have the cable intact that connects to the
air filter from the flaps.  Obviously if I remove the flaps, this goes away
as well.  Is that a bad thing?

Thanks for the opinions.
