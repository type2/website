Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes or Wheel Bearing

 Hi Trey,

My problems related to rear wheel heating all had to
do with the rear brakes. Parking brake not releasing
fully due to a dirty cable one time, another time due
to incorrect parts installed during a brake job.

If you have any doubts about the brakes, I'd open it
up, spray the dust off with a garden hose and inspect
carefully for abnormal wear. You might want to open up
both sides to compare. The brake drum can usually be
removed with a rubber mallet, so you probably don't
need to remove the whole wheel hub to disassemble. You
may have one bolt on the face of the drum to remove.
But the parking brake does has to be off to remove the
drum... Take precautions in case there's asbsetos in
there! Also adjust the rear brakes, including the
parking brake.

Rick
