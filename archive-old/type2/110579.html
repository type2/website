Subject: Re: [T2] Here's a thought about grounding...

&gt; We are all well aware of the need for good grounds on our beloved buses.
&gt; So how about this...
&gt;
&gt; I have seen many trucks and some cars with ground straps that touch the
&gt; ground to release static from the vehicle. If we are grounding to our
&gt; chassis, would not this method improve the grounding we so drastically need

You are confusing signal ground and earth ground

as far as your bus is concerned ground is the chassis. it is the common
side of all the circuits and the low side of the battery.
it is a floating seperate entity electrically.

the only things an earth connection would help would be to discharge any
static and provide a path for a lightning strike.

when we talk of bus grounds and cleaning up its really all those
connections to the chassis that provide the return electrical path to the
battery.
