Actually I, and I'd guess many others, would be interested in this, from
what I've read, I've always understood that Westies were built on 21x or 23x
(depending on whether they're panelled, or windowed) transporters, just as
my '74 Campmobile is built on a 234 transporter.

Unless I'm wrong (as has been the case in the past, once or twice), the
primary BODY difference between the Microbus (24x) &amp; the Kombi (23x) is that
the Microbus had the heater/ventilation routing through to the back, for the
back seat passengers, as I (personally) have never seen a camper interior
built to utilise this feature, I'd expect that there was no real advantage
in using the higher model as a basis for the camper conversions.

Anyone have the definitive answer with regard to what the Westies were built
on?

I'd be interested to know.

Thanks,

Neale

&gt; That surprises me as after 6 years on this list I remember many, many
people claiming their Westfalia conversions were based on sunroof minibuses
which would be a 24 deluxe microbus, at least up to '73 (ish) when they
switched the roof to the open the other way.
&gt;
&gt; So all you Westfalia conversion owners what are the first 2 digits of your
chassis number, and model year of your bus?
&gt; Private mail to me and the anonymous &quot;ncbus&quot; would be best
&gt;
&gt; Good luck

&gt;
&gt; In the US all Westfalia Camper conversions seem to be model 23, kombi.
Other converters such as Adventurewagen, ASI, Sprotsmodbile and Sundial
would convert whatever they could get ahold of.
&gt;
&gt; The bus Jamie is talking about is a real Dormobile conversion, not a westy
with a Dor top as most of the ones in the US seem to be.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Hi Jamie,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;These windows are perfectly normal for the lowerspecified versions of the
transporter, a check on the chassis number would probably show it to be
21...(panel van) or 23... (Kombi). Westfalia conversions were usualy fitted
to 22... (microbus) or 24... (delux microbus) models, which had a higher
spec.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Good luck
