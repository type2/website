&gt;&gt; Driving a Pop-top left me pretty much with only one option.

&gt;
&gt;     ????? I drive a pop-top, and have Yakima racks on it. Carry a big
&gt;streamlined box and two sailboards pretty regularly plus sometimes a bike,
&gt;and sometimes a canoe instead of the sailboards.  What's wrong with a top
&gt;carrier on a pop-top? Other than as I said before, putting the bike on and
&gt;off is a serious hassle -- too much of one, IMHO.
&gt;
&gt;
I never said it couldn't be done, but in my mind it's not an option as I 
don't want to have to take everything off the roof to be able to lift it.

If it's light stuff, I suppose you could leave it on there but I doubt 
those hinges were designed to hold a couple of bikes, etc with the roof 
lifted.

but that's just my opinion as I have no idea what kind of weight those 
hinges were really designed to hold.
