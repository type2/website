Subject: Re: [T2] Need help insuring Westy in Texas

That section is actually governed by the state it is sold in.  My plate 
wasnt installed by westphalia but by the CO inspection center as 
meeting CO requirements and inspection criteria.  No toilet needed 
here.  the beds plus cooking = mobile home  inspection here.  Here in 
colorado my 82 westy is inspected as  a mobile home before original 
sale and registered as MV (multipurpose) rather than RV, or MH.  the 
distinction between the last two i think is axels and weight  and 
living space.
