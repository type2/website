Subject: Part request

Anyone have an extra old &quot;VW&quot; nose emblem for a 74-79
bus laying around?  I have a ton of Bay window parts
to barter or I can do it the &quot;new fangled&quot; way and
just pay you some money for it.  Doesn't have to be
perfect, just use-able and reasonably in-expensive
(read John is a &quot;cheap b*stard&quot; ;^)

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
