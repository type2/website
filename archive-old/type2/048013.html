&gt; No there was no sticker on it. The part was stamped vw audi.  I
&gt; do trust the bus depot, but, i guess it is possible it could be a dansk
part.
&gt; the part number is 021 256 092M.   It did fit after some manipulation.

Yes, it is genuine. Only the original German Volkswagen ones have the
VW/Audi logo on them; the Dansk ones do not.
