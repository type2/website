Subject: Re: [T2] head (gasket) question

There was  a vw tech article issued by vwoa about 10 years ago regarding
this...........it is the same tech article (bulletin) that describes
notching the con rods to throw more oil up on the cylinder wall.

The gist is NOT to use the head gaskets for they are prone to head
leaks........You use a barrel shim between the cylinder and case.  This
keeps the compression ratio the same and allows the head and cylinder to
meet flush without any other material prone to leaks.

Sure some people still use them, but they are the people that are not
familiar with the tech bulletin.

&gt; volks
&gt;
&gt;     I have been having the problem with the 2liter engine in my 78 auto
&gt; tranny, someone suggested a leaky head so last week I swapped out a head.
&gt;
&gt; today I took some time to look it over real good....only thing I could
&gt; really find was some material missing beside the head seat on #4 but no
&gt; hole, in #3 which is where the leak was.....there was some evidence of
&gt; leakage from the cyl... sort of a blackened area fanning out from a spot
&gt; on the head/cyl interface...no damage noticable on the head, didn't see
&gt; any on the Cyl or piston when swapping.
&gt;   looking real real close it appeared that the thin metal gasket between
&gt; the cyl and head may have been leaking.
&gt; .  is this gasket needed
&gt; .  where can I get em
&gt; .  don't you change the compression ratio if you remove em.
&gt; .  what about if you have em on one side but you remove em from the other
&gt;
&gt; all I have are used ones and they are getting old..?????
&gt;
&gt; O great and wise list....inspiration and guidance needed here
&gt;
&gt; thanks
&gt; Bob
