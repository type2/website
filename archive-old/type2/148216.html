Subject: Re: [T2] What did I do wrong?

One thing to remember is that hot oil is thinner and will leak more.

A bad main bearing that moves will allow the engine to leak even with
new main seal.

Blowby will push oil out everywhere.

 was corrected.

 What are the most likely suspects for my leak coming back so soon?
