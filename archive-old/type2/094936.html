Subject: RE: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon


&gt;
&gt;I read somewhere (I wish I could remember where now) that halon
&gt;extinguishers are nolonger sold except for very specific applications
&gt;(server rooms and boats I believe) due to the environmental impact they
&gt;have. It seems like all things that work really well end up being
&gt;outlawed for some reason or another.

It was my understanding that it was a safety hazard that got these pulled 
from the marketplace.  In fact, many industrial applications of halon are 
still in use.  They require oxygen to be nearby for anyone exposed to the 
gas.  It (being heavier than o2) and sinks into the lungs, causing the 
victim(s) to suffocate.  I think people were using the extinguishers 
improperly and killing themselves.
