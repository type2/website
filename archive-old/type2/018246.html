Subject: Removing heads on a 68-71 bus with engine in situ
Message-ID: &lt;374c59d1Removing heads on a 68-71 bus with engine in situ*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Can it be done?

Anything is possible, but you have to ask yourself &quot;is it worth it?&quot;

In this case, no. It takes 15-20 minutes to drop one of these engines with 
the right tools, another 
hour or so to switch the heads and another hour to reassemble and install. So 
in a few hours
the one who removed their motor to switch the head is driving to the beach, 
but the one who
is trying to do it with the motor in the van will just be working the fan 
housing out and needing 
to go find some kneepads for the long night ahead.
