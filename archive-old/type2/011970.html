Well, we made our maiden voyage in our 74 Westy this weekend.  I put the
new canvas from Bus Depot on, along with the new seals, loaded up the
family and headed out.  We went to Lake Mineral Wells state park in
Mineral Wells , Texas, about a 2 hour drive from here.  It rained a good
part of the time, which gave us a good opportunity to check out our seals
and my canvas installation, looks like I need a rear hatch seal.  The bus
ran fine, but by my calculations only got about 14.4 MPG, I was really
hoping for more.  It has an 1800 with a single Solex carb of some type on
it which probably could use some attention. A good time was had by all,
the stove worked great, the fridge kept the Dr Pepper cold and the beds
were comfy.
	One of the highlights was seeing another Westy at the campground.  About
3 sites down from us was a gorgeous white 88 Westy.  A couple from Ft
Worth was out making their maiden voyage as well.

Thanks to the list for your support and info.
