Subject: Re:[T2] Bug motor into Bus

Jim,
   Before you put a motor in your new bus, this is the time to get the gas 
tank out and at least flush it out.  Get rid of 32 years accumulation of 
dirt and rust.  You might want to go the full measure and seal the inside 
with one of the products especially made for this purpose.
