Subject: Re: [T2] New VW camper concept design

Hi all:

I liked the Verdier coach when someone first posted it here earlier this year.  

A couple of comments:

First if any of you have seen &quot;Dr. Who&quot; on TV, you know about the principle that he can make something larger on the inside than it is on the outside.  I think Verdier did this here.

Next, it's interesting to note that Verdier used essenially the same &quot;Z-Bed&quot; our westies use.  Also he kept the cabinets built onto the doors that the Vintage Splittie campers had.

I'd like to see about something like this when my '78 finally becomes a yard ornament.  I hope he builds them and that he does enough for the price to drop 50%, making it comparable with the new EuroVan campers or (dare I say) those made from Daimler Chrysler Sprinters.

BEN
