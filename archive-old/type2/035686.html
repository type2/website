 Volks, 
 
 I am at my wits end.  The '80 won't start and I don't know why :-( This is
 part of the continuing series of problems that I believe the FI has been
 giving me since I got the van.  All summer long, it ran lean and hot (Oil
 = 250 at 60mph).  As the weather cooled down, the oil temps cooled right
 along with them (210 _at_ 65mpg; air temp &lt;50), the engine felt like it was
 getting more gas and the O2 meter on the dash said it was running richer.  
 Thes past two weeks, the temps here have dropped below freezing and the
 van will not start at all.  The engine is the MSHP Stage II in an '80
 V'gon but the FI (AFM and Computer) is from an '81 federal bus.
 
 What I have checked: (note all checks were static or while cranking)
 Dwell = 50 
 Timing ~8 BTDC
 spark visually verified
 Gas pressure = 30+psi at the tap between 3&amp;4
 
 A couple weeks ago, the van would kick at the start of cranking, but not
 start.  If I then depressed the gas half way and cranked it would start
 after 10-20 seconds.  Now it does not kick, and if I crank for 30+
 seconds, with the gas pedal fully depressed, it will buck a bit but not
 start.  After this cranking, the rear of the bus smells heavily of
 gasoline.
 
 I *think* it is flooding almost instantly.  I further think that if I
 could get a 40 degree day it would start, but I would *like* to cure this
 problem, whaterver it is.  Any ideas???

have you checked the fuel pressure regulator?  It is that thingy that sends 
gas back to the tank , and regulates this so the FI system fuel circuit has 
the correct pressure.  If the van starts, you can hook up a guage to the test 
port on the regulator.  it is a goldy colored thing in the gas ring on top of 
the motor, attached to the fuel return line.  on some year s it is attached 
to the front tin on the left hand side.  I think the water cooled have them 
on a flange on the intake manifold.  Anyway, in my experiendce about half the 
buses running around have ones that dont work properly.   If the bus doesn't 
start, remove the FPRegulator  (a few gas lines that won't drain the tank on 
your head and a 17mm nut) and shake it .  If it rattles inside, it is bad, 
get a new one.   I think a new one is circa $30.

but you shouldn't have to step on the gas to start your FI bus.  if you have 
been, it could be a sign of a bad dual relay.
