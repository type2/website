Subject: Re: hydraulic valve lifters or not?

Quite easy -- take off the valve cover, take off one of the rockers,
pull out a pushrod and then the pushrod tube, then pull out the lifter.

   Or you should be able to tell by the amount of clearance -- should be
around .008 or .006 if solids, should be Zero clearance plus two full
turns if hydraulic.
