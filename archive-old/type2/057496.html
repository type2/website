&gt; While visiting a friend of mine in Illinois who owns an

&gt; needs some work, the owner is not only unwilling to
&gt; authorize the work, but has not replied to several
&gt; registered letters.  These folks are willing to give us
&gt; the bus, but obviously there's not going to be a title;
&gt; they'd be willing to apply for a junk title but in
&gt; checking with the Indiana license bureau it turns out
&gt; that once a bus has a junk title it can never be
&gt; plated

I'm not sure about Indiana law, but there must be some provision for a
mecanic's lien on the car.  This would allow the mechanic to take
title of a car to recoup unpaid bills.  This would _not_ be the same
as a junk title, as the mechanic usually sells the vehicle at auction.
 In the case of the bus, I'm sure that there are more charges in
storage fees than in the actual value of the bus, so it would belong
to the mechanic and he is free to make whatever deal with you that he
wants.

I'd be leery of other methods of acquiring title, as the original
owner might pop out of the woodwork and want the bus back.  If you've
used some &quot;expeditous&quot; method of getting title you might find yourself
up on fraud charges!
