Subject: bn4 for sale

a friend had this taken out of her bus last fall and is wanting to sell it.  she may be at octo
and or the classic but if you are interested here is the infor.  if anyone in washington or oregon
wants it and isn't going south let me know at my pocketmail address (pk451301_at_pocketmail_dot_com)  and
i will bring it back if you have made payment arrangements. 

it was taken out by her mechanic as i remember so all the parts are there. Mike Visket saw it so
you might inquire from him or the seller if you have questions.  they live in hollywood and don't
have much use for a gas heater. :-)

please respond to them or my pocketmail if you want me to bring north. i am on the road at 7am
heading south and will not have access to this address..  so if you see zapper on the road not
moving please stop !!!!! but she has been behaving nicely and i gave her a bath and all so she
should be happy....

&gt; any chance you could put something out on Wet Westies before the w/end?
&gt;
&gt; BN-4 Heater.
&gt; If you are coming south this weekend for The Classic, why not contact me
&gt; about a BN-4 gas heater I have for sale here in mid-Los Angeles? I'd be
&gt; willing to bring it to some freeway off-ramp as you speed by!   Heater is
&gt; complete and in v.good condition.  Just dont need it down here, and you
&gt; could install in time to enjoy next winter! Buy now at $200
