    Of course, that's what LiMBO is all about...??

    Not living in a climate where I don't need heat, I drive an '84 Vanagon in
the winter, my '73 Campmobile in the summer, and work on my buddy's '66 Westy
all year long.

&gt; A 1700 would be worthier than an 1800, and a two liter would
&gt; be beyond the pale.

    Actually you got that one backwards....  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;  2.0L are better than 1.8L
and 1.7L are the most despised...

    Thank God it's Friday....
