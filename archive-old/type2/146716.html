Subject: Should caliper bleed screw leak?

Well, of course not during normal operation. However on my 71 bus I have 
a newly installed remanufactured caliper and when I bleed the brakes 
copious amounts of brake fluid come out the threads of the bleed screw 
and flow down the side of the caliper.
To summarize my setup, I have a pressure bleeder (set at 7 psi) 
connected to the brake fluid reservoir. There is a piece of tubing that 
fits tightly over the bleed screw. The other end of the tubing goes into 
a can to collect the fluid. When I open the bleed screw about 1/4 to 1/2 
turn, fluid goes through the tubing as it should but a lot also comes 
out through the bleed screw threads as described above. The bleed screw 
is kind of wobbly except when it is tightened down. Once I tighten the 
bleed screw, I don't see any leaking.
Previously, I have always had universal calipers (with two bleeders) but 
this is my first caliper with a single bleed screw. I have never seen 
this kind of leaking in a bleed screw when bleeding brakes. Is this 
something that is seen occasionally or should I send the caliper back?

Sincere Thanks,
Bill Moon
