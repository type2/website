Subject: Re: [T2] Bentley on CD ROM

I emailed Bentley to clear up the confusion and sure enugh my guess was
right. I suspect the 75-79 CD will wither drop in price or be eliminated
after they take action.

&gt; The CDs are the same. I'm actually surprised that we offer the VFT2
&gt; separately. I don't consider it to be a stand alone product because I
&gt; think there is information on the first CD (VFAC CD1) that is necessary
&gt; to fully service a later (75-79) Transporter. I'll get to the bottom of
&gt; it though.

Stupid mailer daemon thinks I'm quoting too much.

&gt; Basically the information on this CD (VFT2/VFAC CD2) is specific to the
&gt; later (75-79) Transporter and was made from the factory microfiche for
&gt; the 1975-1979 Type 2 models. This was a five fiche set and the part
&gt; number was W-42-028-120-F1, F2, F3, F4, F5. It covers the following:
&gt; -General-Engine (Repair Groups 10, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 24, 26, 27, 28)
&gt; -Clutch-Manual Transmission (Repair Groups 30, 34)
&gt; -Automatic Transmission (Repair Group 37)
&gt; -Suspension, Brake, Steering, Body (Repair Groups 40, 42, 44, 46, 47,
&gt; 75, 76, 77)
&gt; -Heater-Electrical (Repair Groups 82, 90, 92, 94, 97) including the
&gt; Eberspacher BA6 heater.

Take that daemon.

&gt; Obviously it is a much better buy to get the 2CD set (VFAC) than just
&gt; buying the single VFT2 CD for the same price.

And that.

&gt; Thanks for bringing this to our attention.
