Subject: Re: Buying New vs. Used car

Mike,

I've bought both ways.  New car smell is sure nice!

My personal choice would be to start out with a new car
and then you *know* exactly what has and hasn't been done to it.

I've had exactly 1 new car in my life&lt;grin&gt;...and probably owned 
20 cars in my life....it's just that the price of a new car that 
approaches 1/2 the price or so of a nice &quot;new&quot; house($60,000) bothers me.

I've had both good and bad luck with used ones also.

Good luck!

Cheers, dave

&gt; This is automotive in topic but not specifically VW so
&gt; if listees want to reply p-mail, that would be fine.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to get some feedback from listees on a car
&gt; purchase my wife and I will be facing within the next
&gt; few months. I don't think we will be seriously looking
&gt; at leasing a vehicle but purchasing instead.
&gt; 
&gt; We will be replacing our primary automobile (1994
&gt; Pontiac Bonneville with 103,000 miles).
&gt; 
&gt; My wife and I historically keep cars a long time. We
&gt; have never sold a car with less than 100K on it. We
&gt; also have an 87 Nissan Sentra with 136K on it and a
&gt; 1972 VW Beetle with 99,700 miles on it (will never
&gt; sell!!!). We will likely sell the Sentra and I will
&gt; drive the Bonneville and my wife will drive the car we
&gt; purchase.
&gt; 
&gt; My question has to do with the tradeoff of buying a
&gt; new vehicle and the accompanying big first year
&gt; depreciation as opposed to say a used car coming off a
&gt; lease with say 25,000 miles on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously if we were planning to sell the car after
&gt; 3-4 years, then the precipitous drop in value after
&gt; the first year might be important but since we hold
&gt; the car a long time, would we be better off just
&gt; buying a new one with low miles?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure there are a number of other things to
&gt; consider but I'm predominantly interested in feedback
&gt; from listees on the new vs. used issue.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, we will be looking at mid to full size 4 dr.
&gt; sedans like Nissan Altima and Maxima, VW Passat,
&gt; Pontiac Bonneville and Grand Prix, Toyota Camry and
&gt; Avalon, Mazda 626 and Millenia. May look at Volvos but
&gt; they may be out of price range.
&gt; 
&gt; If listees have any advice on brands and models they
&gt; have had good experience with, I'd welcome the
&gt; comments.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for feedback.
&gt; 
&gt; Mike Morehouse
