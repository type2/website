&gt; Sorry to hear it. I think your assessment is correct. Can't be fixed
&gt; without teardown. Might or might not last who knows how long. You just have
&gt; to bite the bullet and scrounge the bucks to budget a motor R&amp;R. I would
&gt; consider sending the GEX in as a core to a proper rebuilder for a long
&gt; block sitting ready on the shelf. Who knows what else is GEXed up in there. 

Nothing else is GEXed up in there because nothing in there is GEX, just
didn't have a case when I did the rebuild year and half ago, the case was
thourghly inspected but obviously missed this.....I put almost $2,500 into
this 1gram balance rebuild, mahle piston, new cam, etc, etc, etc  really
can't afford to do this every year or so.

&gt; Consider NW Connecting Rod, Seattle. The have the right equipment and
&gt; skills to reweld cracked aluminum properly. Every remanufactured long
&gt; block/short block/head/flywheel they have sent me has been just gorgeous,
&gt; with no comebacks at all. As well, they have 2 generations of VW
&gt; experience, and do VW motors only, air or water cooled, gas or diesel.   

they are a long haul from the East coast, wonder how much they would
charge to do a rebuild using these components on a new case???  since
every thing in there should be in good condition, heck had the heads
dang near blueprinted with diesel seats etc.

&gt; &gt;went out this morning to do a regular oil/filter change.  pulled the nut
&gt; &gt;off the strainer and drained the oil. looked ok, looked at strainer and
&gt; &gt;there were two good sized hunks  of metal, knew instantly what they were..
&gt; &gt;  they were curved and sort of triangular.  and had threads on the inside,
&gt; &gt;it was part of the boss that holds the oil strainer stud..
