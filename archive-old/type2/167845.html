Subject: Re: [T2] Transition from Gas to Diesel

Nice looking job David.  It doesn't look like the engine needed to be 
slanted to fit, do you still have some room above the valve cover? 
I'll have to give you an &quot;A&quot; for this job!!

Rick Taylor


&gt;You would think that with diesel now cheaper than regular unleaded 
&gt;that I would have progressed beyond what is described on page 4, but 
&gt;you'd be wrong.  :-(
&gt;
&gt;I still think it's a good idea.  :-)
