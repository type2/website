&gt;Funny thing was the van broken down in front of a huge bank of mail boxed.
&gt;Of the 20 or so people that stopped to check their mail, only one person
&gt;asked us what was going on. Even a person in a vanagon stopped without
&gt;saying anything.

In 3 years I've been waved at less than 5 times by other VW owners. Maybe once by a Vanagon driver.

&gt;Then, a 1 hour backup of traffic crossing the Bay Bridge because of the
&gt;toll booths. Geez, I guess backing up traffic up to Berkeley is worth
&gt;collecting 3 bucks on a Saturday afternoon.

Welcome to the Bay Area! :-)

&gt;In Sutherlin, OR, we stopped for fuel, both for the car, and for us. I
&gt;think this is the first time I have eaten food from A&amp;W in 20 years, or
&gt;so. But, my pop wanted a burger, and it was part of the gas station.

I always stop at that Chevron for an an A&amp;W root beer.
