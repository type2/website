Subject: Re: [T2] Dizzy changeout - what factors?

&gt; &gt; That distributor will NOT work properly on the 30 PICT series of carbs;
the
&gt; &gt; vacuum requirement of the distributor is different than what the carb
gives
&gt; &gt; it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the info, John - does that mean the carb (?fitting?
&gt; ?manifold vacuum?) doesn't supply enough vacuum - and therefore
&gt; not enough advance?

exactly; notice that the distributor biscuit (advance can) on 70' and
earlier models is BIGGER than the 71' and newer ones, because of a lower
vacuum signal from the carb.
