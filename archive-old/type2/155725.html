Subject: Re: [T2] Starting the Bus for the first time, what do I do?

&gt; 2 - What do I need to hook up in the front compartment at minimum to at
&gt; least
&gt; be able to get the Bus running so I can drive it around?
&gt;

Nothing.

Jumper from battery + to coil+.
Remote starter or a screwdriver to turn it over.

That's enough electrical to get it running for changing parking places. Just
keep in mind if you have wires loose up front, energizing the coil may make
some wires up there hot too. So if you can insulate the stray wiring up
there from the coil and engine compartment you'll be fine.
