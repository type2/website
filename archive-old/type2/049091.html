&gt; Those are cool!  I wonder how much those cost; that would be perfect for those
&gt; remote parts runs.
&gt; 
&gt; How about a VW-powered generator/compress all-in-one - is that even possible?

Something like two cylinders for making it run, two for compressing air, and
the end of the crankshaft (you pick which end) hooked up to the alternator
off a &quot;generator set&quot;? You'd have to run it at 1800 or 3600RPM (it's an
electrical thing) all the time you were making electricity, but other than
that it should work okay.
