Subject: RE: [T2] '72 Bus-A Year to Avoid?

Hey Jeff, Ian here at work, My last bus was a 72 hardtop. At first I thought
it would be a pain not having the top engine access , but then I realised
after working on it that Most the time I had so much stuff covering over
mine in the 74 that I didnt use it . I was really used to climing up in
there to get to things , and never could I not get to something. The bumper
brackets are a 1 yr only thing but the bumpers are the same as 68-71. I dont
mind the 72 yr at all. Plus you get the cool low turn signals:) I would buy
it . later

Subject: [T2] '72 Bus-A Year to Avoid?


Hey Folks,
    I have a chance to buy a '72 bus (Westfalia) for a fairly decent price.
Advice from respected bus friends though say to stay away from the '72 model
year, lot of one year only parts that are difficult to find. The dual carbs
have been replaced with a single Weber ( I used to own a '75 bus with the FI
removed and a single Weber, so I know what I'm getting into there). Opinions
please from owners/former owners of '72's-buy it or run? I don't need advice
on buses in general, I've owned plenty! Just info on '72's.  Thanks,  Jeff
Stewart
