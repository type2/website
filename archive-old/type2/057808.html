Subject: Re: Piston Cylinder question

Tim:

I would have thought the gaskets you received with heads would be the 
fairly thick gasket that goes between the cylinder and heads, not the thin 
cylinder spacers that go between cylinder and block.  The latter shims 
come in a variety of thicknesses that you can only determine with the 
engine partially assembled, so a head provider could only guess at the 
right dimension.

&gt; I'm getting ready to install a fresh set of AVP heads in my 79 this

&gt; received the heads I noticed that I will have to remove the cylinder
&gt; barrels in order to install the metal shim-gaskets provided with the heads
&gt; to maintain proper compression.  My question is whether I need to do
&gt; anything to the cylinders..i.e. hone to break glaze etc... before I
&gt; reassemble.  I'd rather not mess with all of that since I might as well
&gt; install new rings if I'm gonna do all that.
