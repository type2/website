Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ?

Mileage?  It will never be a Prius.

The difference will be unmeasurable in my opinion.

The pennies you might save on mileage by moving the tire inside will not replace the value of the space inside, which is also my opinion of course.

I need a new spare cover and I was thinking that a hard cover would be less turbulent, but I also think this is silly.

The average home costs $1.00 per square foot a month, space is valuable.

If you want better mileage attach a 20' long cone to the back, lower it as far as you can stand, add an air dam and ground affects and tune it up properly(the tune up is the only serious part, but the rest would help, in theory).

Look up &quot;Carl Heap Phoenix Bonneville&quot; on Google for some impressive aerodynamics treatment, pay special attention to the last picture.

Happy Friday!

the spare attached to the nose , 
&gt; 
&gt; how bad is that for fuel milage ? 
&gt; 
&gt; it really takes up too much space inside but what else do you do ?
