Okay.  I guess i could scour the net and get the specs on this carb, but u guys are right here!... ;]

I haven't noticed gas pumping out of the carb, but the thing (75 formerly FI 1800) sure as hell doesn't want to run right.  I have a feeling that the oil leaking out of a crack in the exhaust just before the muffler, a clean, wet spark plug in cylinder #3 and the fact that it doesn't want to run are all related - but thatz another story ;]  Suffice to say i have lots of trblshooting yet to do...

Just checked Jbugs catalog - the pump they list (which looks alot like mine) says its running at 2-4 psi...
Is that right for this (got this info from Jbugs too) 32/36 DFEV Weber?

TIA again...

&gt;  Most definitely get a regualator -- unless your pump is capable of
&gt;automatically cutting off when it feels back pressure, which most won't.
&gt;Otherwise it will overpower the float and you'll see gas leaking out the
&gt;top of the carb. 
&gt;    The stock mechanical pump only puts out a few psi.
