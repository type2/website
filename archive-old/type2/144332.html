Subject: [T2]Alternator wireing....?

On the back of a alternator the little black box wire hooks to one bolt and the starter etc to another or  do they both get hooked to the same bolt inside the black cover?
 
does it matter which bolt they get hooked to if they do get hooked together?
 
taking off my alternator the little wire from the little black diode on the back of the alternator and the wire from the starter and regualtor were also hooked to this same bolt...
 
the alternator i am installing has the little black wire going to the opposite bolt mine has it on....? reason for question dont want to burn a new alternator up......and always wondered this question every time i have to work on a alternator....
 
thanks wasnt sure and my mind isnt with me past couple days now stress getting best of me.//
