&quot;If anyone sees an original 74-79 non-locking
gas cap floating around in their posession, I am willing to pay a
reasonable amount of small unmarked bills (or paypal) to again procure
said gas cap for my 79 camper.  humbly yours, Greg&quot;


Greg, if you haven't ordered or obtained one from another source,(I'm on digest and just saw your post)I've got one (non-locking) in the stash, I think. Yours for shipping charge only.
