hi...
    What i did was to find an old parts bus (pic a part ect.) that had good cv joints. They were almost new, so i just had the whole axel swaped. This seeened to be a cheeper/easier solution since at the time i was too busy at work to do the job myself...so in total the job cost just under $100.00 bucks...

later
