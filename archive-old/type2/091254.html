Subject: fs: 75 westy in VA

alas, fellow veedubbers...i have placed my beloved bus
'rettung' up for sale on thesamba.  i cherished
everyday of my year long trip in him and it saddens me
greatly to have to give him up.  i toyed with the idea
of keeping him for myself, but i found that he gets
driven very little now and i fear he will only become
a home for the field mice.

i only hope that someone can give him a good home
where he can be looked after.  i feel as if i'm losing
a part of my family.

thanks for you ear volks.
