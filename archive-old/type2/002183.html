Hey there,

  I've been trying to email that highly recommended Boston Bob engine
builder but haven't gotten any response in the last two weeks.
  I'm starting to think I should look for a local builder to avoid such
unresponsiveness. Anybody know a really good Northwest engine builder?

Thanks,
Neil Sundberg
