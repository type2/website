Hi everyone, I have a 1972 ASI Riviera camper which I bought last November.
It is pretty solid, though in need a lot of freshening up.

The engine is a 1975 2000 cc model with duel Dellorto 36s and a Bosch 009.
My question is, can I switch to a vacuum advance distributor?  The driver's
side carb looks like it has a vacuum port.  I have seen a couple references
that said no, but I'm still wondering.

Anybody know?

Regards,

Grant
