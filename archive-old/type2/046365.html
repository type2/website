Subject: Re: [T2] relocating battery in 72 bus

Batteries in the back of busses should go in plastic battery boxes as 
made by Rubbermaid, and others.

These boxes cost about $9 - $10.
If your local flaps does not have them (duh?), then they can be had at 
a marine supply store.

A size 24 battery and size 24 box will fit just fine and the 24 size 
will allow you to decide whether you want long duration battery 
selection, or out the wazoo cranking amps.

Battery acid is bad stuff to bus metal, as we all can see from past 
corrosion, and as will be seen by future corrosion, no matter what you 
do, unless the batteries are enclosed.

Our busses deserve the protection.
