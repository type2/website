Subject: RE: installing a skylight

I see that this skylight fits between the ribs in the poptop as opposed to 
most skylights I've seen offered on the market today that are too wide and a 
gap is created hence Tony's post about the install he saw with tons of calk 
around the skylight. 

I talked to a guy that does fibrglass boat hulls and he told me I would have 
to build a seat out of wood and then glass over it to get it to stick to the 
poptop. He also said it would be labor intensive$$$$ The thing to have would 
be one of these skylights in the pic on the link.
