Subject: Columbus Day Campout at Seneca, WV

I did a little looking around and GORP has a great set of pages that
describe the various NF camp grounds.  The URL for the Seneca Shadows
site is:

http://www.gorp_dot_com/dow/eastern/moncmp.htm#seneca shadows

This page contains directions, prices, and a description of the place.
The dates for the campout are Friday, Oct. 11 - Monday, Oct. 14.  Though
the page lists this as a &quot;hosted&quot; campground and has a number for
reservations, the reservations cut off is on October 1, so it will be
first come, first served by the time we arrive.

As I intend to take Friday the 11th off so as to arrive early, claiming a
group site will not be difficult if we have enough (at least 10) busses
coming and we want to &quot;circle the busses&quot;.  If, OTOH, everyone wants to
take an individual site, that would not be a problem either, but it would
be a bit pricier.

IMPORTANT:
If you intend to come, I would like to know so I can get a bus count.  If
you would like to go in on the group site, I would like to know that too.

In addition on a separate page there is a picture of Seneca Rocks viewed
from the site.  URL is:

If you want to look at the site on a map, I recommend Mapquest (URL =
http://www.mapquest_dot_com/)  You will need to register, after which doing a
&quot;find&quot; on Seneca Rocks, WV brings you right to the area.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know.  Hoping to
see a bunch of busses there,

                           H Steven Dolan
