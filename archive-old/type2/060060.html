Subject: heat resistant tape?

Greetings.  

I am cross posting because this could relate to a bug as well (duh?!:).

I am trying to seal off a leaky connection at the rear entrance of the
heat exchangers on my 71 bus where the fan blower tubes connect to the
heat exchangers.  I just put a new exhaust and heat exchanger system on
the bus and it fits tightly... 

So tightly in fact that where there had previously been room for some of
the foil 2&quot; heater tubes connecting the metal insert that goes through 
the tin with the exchanger, now there is no room for a foil/paper tube.

So I was wondering if anyone knew of some heat resistant tape (a la duct
tape) that might work to seal off this gap in the heating system?
Something that would probably have a temp range of 300-500 degrees (?).

Perhaps it would just be easier to run some of the foil tubing right from
the fan housing to the exchanger, but it looked a little tricky going
through the rear tin.  I'll look at it again.

Would muffler tape work, or is that too messy?  Any other ideas?

Thanks
