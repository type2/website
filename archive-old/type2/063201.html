Subject: No VW content (powering laptops)

        ***WARNING***Do Not do this if you value your laptop.

        There was some talk this week about powering laptops on the road.
This is what I did.

        The first thing that I did was to check the battery voltage (at full
charge) on my GRID 386 laptop.  Lucky me, it was 12V (well, 11.95VDC).
Anything from 9-15 volts would have been OK.  If it had been below 9 I would
have needed to make a simple voltage regulator.  Above 15 would have been
more of a problem (most schemes for raising DC voltage are electricaly noisy).

        Next I took a pair of hooded alagator clips, a long piece of braided
twinlesad wire and a fused cigarette lighter plug.  You can figure out the rest.

        Be sure to

                1)remove the main battery (ni-cad).  It will melt/burst into
flames if exposed to this kind if dirrect current (besides, to hook the clip
to the battery contact of the laptop the battery needs to be out)

                2)get the polarity going into the laptop right.  There is
probably no reverse voltage protection in it(after geting it right, I then
painted a red+ next to the positive contact).

                3)unplug the cigarette lighter plug when this is not in
use(or else the grimlins will find this piece of wire and do something very
nasty).
