I'm not sure if Compu-Fire makes a unit for a vac distributor. I'm =
running a Pertronix Ignitor on my '79 bus with stock vac dizzy. The =
grommet that fills the square condensor hole in the side of the dizzy is =
round, but it goes in okay with a little lube and elbow grease.

I installed the Pertronix in about 1996 or so. Runs great, no problems. =
I think that you have to order the Pertronix or Compu-Fire for a stock =
vac dizzy, because the dealer will usually assume that you're running a =
009.

There are other vac dizzies out there that should work if yours won't. =
Consult the Type2 archives.

P.S. Once it's running, be sure to time it with a strobe light at RPM. A =
Type I engine should advance to about 30 degrees BTDC _at_ 3,500 RPM.

Good Luck,

r.d.

I've been attempting to put compu-fire in my bus, but
it wouldn't fit in my vacuum advance distributor.
Bosch 0231 137 035 (a round condenser plug goes in the
bottom.)

The parts guy says that compu-fire doesn't make a unit
to fit my distributor, the only one he had has a
square side plug and the unit itself won't sit flat in
my distributor.

If i have to go to another vacuum-advance distributor
to put electronic ignition in, what would be a good
choice?

The parts guy tried to sell me a 009. And I have a
friend with a used double-vacuum hose model.

OR--should I go to Pertronix--do they make a unit
compatible with my distributor?

(til i figure this out, i just put in new points,
condenser, cap, rotor.)
