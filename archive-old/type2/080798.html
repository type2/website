Subject: Re: [T2] Arrghh!! Help! The indicator arm is  busted!

Put a flathead screwdriver under the edge of the horn buttton, not under the
aluminum ring. Pop the horn button off. Big nut under the horn (27mm?) holds
the steering wheel on, remove it.Unhook horn ground wire, lift steering
wheel off.(sometimes a hassel, plastic hammer swung from underneath helps
immensely,) also mark steering wheel and splines with a felt pen so when you
put your wheel back on your &quot;handlebars&quot; are straight&gt;
Now you can see the 4 screws that hold the signal/wiper switches on. The
plastic arrangement that opens and closes the switch for each indicator is
probably broken. Take 4 scews out, remove busted switch, reinstall new one,
assuming you have been able to find one.
Hope this helps.
Good luck
Brian

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; I really need some help FAST!
&gt; Tonight I drove 3 hours from my house near Orange,
&gt; about 300kms west of Sydney, into Sydney &amp; just as I
&gt; got off the freeway the indicator arm on my 77
&gt; Microbus started playing up.
&gt; The left hand indicator wouldn't stay on &amp; the RH one
&gt; would stick when I put it on.
&gt; Finally after I'd arrived where I'm staying until
&gt; Sunday, I was showing a friend the problem &amp; it broke
&gt; all together, JAMMING the right hand indicator ON.
&gt; What's the deal with changing it over?
&gt; Is it difficult?
&gt; Could it just be some loose screws or am I in for a
&gt; new assembly?
&gt; How do I get the horn button out &amp; the steering wheel
&gt; off to have a look?
&gt; Please answer as quick as you can.
&gt; Tomorrow morning I'm supposed to pick up a HEAP of
&gt; parts to help put my 72 single cab on the road, I have
&gt; an engagement party in the afternoon &amp; on Sunday I
&gt; have my own birthday lunch to go to.
&gt; How long will this take me?
&gt; I'd appreciate any help.
&gt; I looked in the type2_dot_com archives &amp; couldn't find
&gt; anything.
&gt; :-(
&gt; HELP!
&gt; Andreww Wood
