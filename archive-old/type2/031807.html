&gt; Should my next (and hopefully final) valve adjustment be on a cold or warm

cold engine

&gt; Should I now use the 1/4 to 1/2 turn in after contact with valve setting or 
&gt; should I use Bentley's 2 full turns in?

I use 1.5 turns figureing that when I pull the nut down tight it wil give
it up to an extra .5 or so turn, so when finished I have 1.5-2 turns in. 

has worked well for the 8 years I've owned this bus
