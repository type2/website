I have been driving my DC during the latest deep freeze that hit Colorado.
The truck did great on the ice and snow and my frostbite was minimal. I was
surprised.

So I hop in to go to work on Thursday and let it idle a bit while I load in
a few things. Driving down the road, I became something out of a James Bond
film. A thick grey smokescreen was following me.

I quickly pulled over and discovered oil POURING out my pulley seal. WTH???
I coasted home (luckily) and parked it.

Yesterday I discovered that my mechanical fuel pump hadn't failed to pump
fuel to the engine it just started pumping fuel into the crankcase. This
liquefied the oil and GOOSH... All over my header.

So I swapped in a new fuel pump and carb (because it was time) and cleaned
the very oily motor. Now all is well.

I am still getting some leaks that were worse than before. I am just
fortunate that gasoline didn't seep past the rings and ignite inside of the
crankcase or thin to the point of igniting on my header.

The DC runs so well that I got pulled over last night for speeding. I didn't
get a ticket though. It is hard to justify one when you and the cop are both
laughing.

Cheers to all. Now back to putting up X-Mas lights.
