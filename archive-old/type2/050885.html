Are you sure its a fuel problem?  Try changing the condenser.

	[...] 
&gt; I have it home now but when I went out yesterday (one week later) and
&gt; tried to start it, I had no luck. I also smelled a fairly strong gas
&gt; smell possibly due to the fact that there was no firing. Today I got it
&gt; to start but it would die suddenly after about 2 minutes. I did this
&gt; twice and then gave up in frustration.
&gt; 
&gt; I looked all through the archives and found so many possibilities I
&gt; don't know where to start. HELP PLEASE!  Any advice will be greatly
&gt; appreciated.
