&gt;I will unfortunately be unable to make this years BBTA.  I will not be
&gt;able to install much needed wheel bearings and do a tune-up before
&gt;Friday.  I have simply been too busy.  Is a shame, I really wanted to
&gt;meet Da Boat this year.

I'm not going to make it either.  My bus's tranny has a bad bearing, my
brakes need to be bled, the roof is leaking, and my daily driver Mustang's
transmission exploded at the track last weekend.  Plus my house is a mess,
and I'm broke.  Actually I was just kidding about not making it - I decided
several months ago that I would be attending BBTA come hell or high water.
If I let life's little problems influence my decision, I would never, ever,
EVER make it to Busses by the Arch, and that would be a shame.  Of course I
wouldn't ever kill someone for not feeling the same way, but I sure am
disappointed.
