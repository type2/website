Subject: Starter installation questions

All,

I have just passed the one year anniversary of VW bus ownership. Oddly
enough the weather is the same as it was this time last year when I had
to pull the engine to replace the clutch.

This weekend I am planning on installing a new starter in the Westy.
Are there any hints, tips, suggestions ya'll have before I tackle the
job?
Also, is there a way to do this without removing the engine, or should I
pull it, and be done with it?

Thanks in advance,

David
