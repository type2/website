Subject: Re: [T2] LOUD FUEL PUMP?

Mechanical pumps are relatively cheap.  \
Electric pumps can range from 50 dollars on up to 600 dollars, depending 
on vehicle application and pressure.  Havent checked for sure which one 
it is on the fuel injected pumps but if it is the same low pressure 
bosch that i have seen on quite a few VW it runs 80 to 160 depending on 
brand and where bought.
The bosch electric should not be making very loud noises.  This is 
usually either a crimped fuel line, a pinhole leak downstream from the 
pump sucking in air (and destroying the centrifical pump through 
cavitation), fuel filter clogged.  If checking the line shows a clear 
path and filter is good, dont trust the pump to last very long.  I have 
learned that you may not even make it to the parts store and back home.
  BTW most newer vehicles the number one killer of fuel pumps is running 
out of gas and cavitating.  These pumps do not pump air very well.  
Number two is running the tank to low on in the in tank pumps in 
extremely high temps.  The gas is also the pump coolant.  We see a lot 
of fuel pumps in the shop at this time of year.
