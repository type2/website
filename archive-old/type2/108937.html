Subject: Re: [T2] More Deck Height Confusion

As far as determining deck height, I find that difficult in a TypeIV
engine (I'm guessing that's what you're talking about here) because
of the depression in the top of the piston.  Absent some sort of
special jig, I've found the best way for me (i.e., repeatable
measurements) is to bolt the cylinder in place using spacers to
take up the slack between the stud threads and the top of the
cylinder.  (I cut and shaped some shims out of plastic tubing
that rests on the &quot;ridge&quot; next to the top fin, allowing me to bolt
us some pretty good torque without worrying about breaking off
a fin.)  Then use a good straight-edge and feeler gauges to measure
deck height, i.e., put the piston at TDC, lay the straight edge across the
top of the cylinder, and use your feeler gauges to determine the space
between the straight edge and the top of the piston, measured near the outer
circumference of the piston where the piston top is flat.  That's your deck
height.

If you're using regular VW heads - not AMC heads with the machined
in step - then you can try the method described by Stan Wilder
whereby you bolt on the heads and then crush something like a piece
of solder between the top of the cylinder and the bottom of the head
and measure the crushed piece with a micrometer.  Can't use this
method with AMC heads because then you'd be measuring the sum
of deck height and the step height with no way to determine which
is which.

Subject: [T2] More Deck Height Confusion

&gt; thanks for all the good advice, i now have a good understanding of how to
&gt; do all the calculations and whatnot. i have no trouble calculating my
&gt; sweep volume, but my deck volume is still eluding me. what exactly is the
&gt; deck height and how do i measure it.
