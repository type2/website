Subject: Bus Doesn't Start

Hey Guys,

I was out running errands today with no problems.  Then, the Bus just
wouldn't start.  I push started it with no problems.  Later, when I tried to
jump start the bus it wouldn't.  I even replaced the battery, but it still
wouldn't start.  When I turn the key, it makes the click but just doesn't
turn-over.  I guess that means something is wrong with either the starter or
the solenoid, but I don't know how to further test and isolate the problem.
Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
