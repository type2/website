Subject: Body shop recommendations

Hello all.
I received a couple of great responses when I posted for a good VW mechanic in Eastern Massachusetts including one in Southern NH. (Greg's in Natick is going to do some surgery on my Westy this month.) Now I need some more help but this is to get some serious body work done to my 72 Super Beetle. The body is a wreck but still salvageable - I'll be throwing good money after bad I'm sure but I'm determined to save the car. Does anyone know of a respectable body shop in Eastern MA or Southern NH, ME or RI (um, yes basically eastern New England... ).
Thanks everyone and hope you've had a happy summer - it's back to school for my 16 year old today... 
Anne
