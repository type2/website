Subject: Re: [T2] Vinal Cleaner and Cargo Carpet

Hi Glenn,

Any kind of soap should be fine for cleanup -- dish soap, 409, etc.
Then follow with rinse, dry and the preservative / protectant of your
choice.

Cargo is felt, or felt like material such as found in modern autos,
adhered to millboard.

 The '72 Bus reinstallation of interior parts continues.  While I try to be
 as clean as possible, some of the new vinal headliner, seat covers, etc.
 need to be cleaned.  What product is considered the best for this job?  I
 personally do not use ArmorAll products.

 A second problem is replacing the surface in the cargo area.  Is the
 original material Felt?  Does anyone sell a precut piece to put on the
 Engine Deck and Back seat area?
