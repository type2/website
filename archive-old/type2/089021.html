Subject: Re: [T2] hub caps

Michael,

Why not put shiny hubcaps on an unpainted bus?  My Bus looks like it was
shot at and missed, shot at and hit, but the hubcabs look shiny new.  They
make the Bus look better than it is.  If you have/find old dingy ones, spend
a few minutes with some metal polish, they will shine up beautifully, and
look great.

Remember in the book, &quot;Christine,&quot; Arnie has a flat and has to get a new
tire.  Dennis thinks that the new tire on the old crusty car makes the &quot;new&quot;
of the car from way back shine through.  For him it is a bad thing, for a
Bus it would be a good thing!

Best Regards,

Mike Clark
