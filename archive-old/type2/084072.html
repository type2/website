&gt;
&gt; You do not want to run a tire with less than 1540 pounds load rating as
&gt; this is the rating specified by VW.  This is particularly important for a
&gt; camper, as you are going around loaded all the time.
&gt;
&gt; I've gone the floppy tire route and paid the price with two tread
&gt; separations within 100 miles.  Since then I've run Bridgestone RD603Vs in
&gt; 185R15 load range D with good handling, good wear, and no problems.

On the Type2 web site there's a great write-up called &quot;Tires for our
Buses (T2 or T3)&quot;.  One of the things mentioned in there is that the
original Bus tires are a 185R 14 which
has an 82% aspect ratio.  This works out to a 207cm circumference.  In
looking for tires I found that many tires have the aspect ratio listed
on the tire -- 185/75R 14 or
whatever.  Don't make the mistake of getting a 185 tire with the wrong
aspect ratio because it will throw your speedometer off and, worse, your
engine will need to race to keep
up with traffic.  I ended up getting 195/75R 14 tires because it was
basically the only thing I could find at the time.  When I go shopping
again I'm going to keep at it until I
find that true 185R 14 or a 205/75R 14 (which has an equivalent
circumference).
