&gt; Have you considered &quot;TufTred&quot; this stuff is fantastic, it is a fibreglasss
&gt; impregnated marine plywood.  this stuff isn't cheap but it is impervious
&gt; to everything and doesn't hold water, little hard to find too, I know a
&gt; source in the Mid Atlantic (Harbor Sales in Annapolis MD) sorry don't know
&gt; about the rest of the country.

I've also considered Trex, which is sawdust stirred into plastic then dumped
into a mold. This is the &quot;hot stuff&quot; for decks right now.

I've also seen Ipe and Pau Lope planking, both are decking and neither is
cheap--at least $5 a board foot. Hmm...actually, mahogany is cheaper than
any of that stuff (around $4.50/bf) and a floor of that would make the
interior really sharp.
