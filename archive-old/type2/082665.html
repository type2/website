Subject: Re: [T2] Where to get fuel tank??

&gt; Allright, what gives?!?!  I have searched ALL of the online parts

&gt; Anyone know where I can get one???


If you want a '68-71 tank, as Thom said, the junkyard is the only source I
know of.  This is very strange, as the new Brazilian buses, AFAIK, are
carb and the tank should be the same as the '68-71 tank.  Maybe just a
lack of demand?

HOWEVER....  The major difference between the early and late tanks is the
fuel outlet.  The '67-71 is set up for carbs and have one outlet and an
internal strainer.  The late tanks have two outlets for the FI and no
strainer.

(WARNING: I have *not* done what I describe below, but...)

I cannot think, offhand, of any reason for not using a late tank in an
early bus.  Either seal the extra tap or use it to feed your BN-4 :-).
The inlet was, as far as I can remember, the same diameter and in the same
corner of the tank.  There may have been vent differences, but they don't
stick out in my mind.  If you want to be absolutely stock, you could cut
the outlet from your old tank and have it welded in to the new tank.

PS:  on another subject entirely, I am attempting to teach myself freeBSD
UNIX at home, in my spare time, for fun.  I have reached the point of
installing a package from a tar file and it is giving me fits!  Anyone who
would like to offer advice on installing packages in UNIX, please write
me!
