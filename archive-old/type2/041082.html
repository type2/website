Subject: bus engine

i would like to know if a bug engine would fit into a 1975 camper van
which has an automatic trans.
the reason i'm asking is my engine is totaly toast and i need to buy
another. so i was wondering if i was limited to van engines only, or if
i could put a bug engine in my van as an alternative too? thanks for the
help
