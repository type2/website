&gt; George,  In your comments about David Easterwood's &quot;year-by-year&quot; bus
&gt; differences, you mention that &quot;with 5 lug wheels you get composite
&gt; drums&quot;.

I misspoke.  I should have said &quot;With the small-bolt-circle 5-lug...&quot;,
since all buses come with 5-lug wheels!

&gt;  So a person really can work on their brakes without taking off
&gt; that big &quot;253 ft/lbs.&quot; nut?  I'm working on mine, atleast thinking
about
&gt; it&quot; at the present, and have been fretting about going out and
getting me
&gt; a big 3/4&quot; breaker bar and 1 13/16&quot; socket, etc.  Will this drum
come off
&gt; without a puller?  I've smacked the sides a few times with a large
&gt; hammer, and all I've gotten is a bunch of brake dust out the bottom. 
&gt; This all started when I tried to adjust the rear brakes with the
stars. 
&gt; The back one (RR wheel) moved ok, but the front one attached to the
&gt; emerg. brake won't budge, and is only making the hole that I plug with
&gt; the little rubber stopper bigger.

Yes, they stick now and then.  You'll want to pull the star wheel out
of its socket and clean and grease the threads, star wheel, and
socket.  I use anti-sieze for this purpose, though regular grease will
work fine.  Be careful not to break the spring-finger when you pull
and install the star-wheel.
  
&gt; I decided that I'd just get inside the drum and take a look at
&gt; everything, since I can't move the brake stars.  By the way, if
puller is
&gt; needed, must it be a &quot;drum puller&quot;, or could I buy or rent another
kind
&gt; that would work, without bolting to the lugs?

The drum should come off by hand, but they can be stubborn if it has
been in place for a long time.  I've developed a habit of pulling mine
off whenever the wheel is off, supposedly to check the linings, but
also to keep the drums from freezing to the hubs.

There are a couple of flat-head screws inside of the lugs that have to
come off before the drum will come off.  These were missing from my
bus and I haven't replaced them.  The drum seems to be held quite
securely by the wheel and my theory is that the flat-head screws were
there to prevent the drum from falling off while the hubs were being
handled in the factory.

My best advice is to give the base of the lugs and the hub-drum joint
(running around the hub) a few liberal shots of penetrating oil over
several days.  Let is soak in good!  Then use a heavy rubber mallet
(not a metal hammer!) and give the thing a good beating!  Once it
starts to move, you can work it back and forth until it loostens
enought to pop it off.

Some people have mentioned using anti-sieze or similar materials when
reinstalling.  If you go this route, be sure that the anti-sieze
cannot migrate along the inner face of the drum to the friction
surface.  In other words, be _very_ sparing with the stuff! 

If you still can't get the drum off, then you have two options.  You
can pull the big nut and take the hub off entirell, or you can try a
puller. You don't want a puller that attaches to the lug bolts, since
you will then be trying to pull the big nut off of its threads!  You
want one that bears on the end of the stub axle and pulls on the inner
rim of the drum.

If you go the big nut route, be sure to get hefty 3/4 inch drive
tools. 1/2 inch drive stuff just won't hack it!  I recommend a
slide-bar over the breaker-bar, as it is stronger and more stable. 
Put a 5-foot pipe over the slide bar, be sure the bus is on the ground
and blocked, and the nut should come off easily!

Have fun!  Let us know how it goes!

George Lyle
