&gt;  I never really took notice of the fuses that closely. Of the new ones
I have, 16A and 25A are copper but the 8A look brass-colored. The 16A and
8A fuses seem to have the same thickness in the middle so I would guess
that the different metals are required for different current ratings.
Maybe a copper 8A fuse would be too fragile. &gt;

The fuses may be made of different materials, or they may just have
different plating on them.  I would love to find some that are gold plated
so that they wouldn't corrode.  Perhaps at the Mercedes dealer... :)

There are at least two different varieties of ceramic bodies.  The smooth
body with the indents for the fuse elements are late, while the round
bodies with circular ridges are the old style.  I'm sure the vintage guys
are hoarding those!
