I sit and read many an email only to not answer cause the owner says this is 
it, time to get rid of this darn thing, or is it to big a problem to keep.  I 
don't mind the tech talk guys but I'll be da_NED if I'm here to listen to 
people needing help to fix their bus, sell it and leave the scene.  Good 
example to get better responses.
1.(not to say)  This darn thing has finally had one problem to many I've had 
enough I'm thinking of .......
2. (way to say)  Another day  in the VW scene and my baby took to dumpin 
large amounts of texas treasure.=I'll answer
get my drift, it's kinda like my wedding vows til death do us part etc.......
Peace Out
