Subject: Re: [T2] turn signal indicator works only in one side

&gt; My 71 Volkswagen Bus blinks the right side of turn indicator on the dash even I make
&gt; left turn. So it blinks whenever I signal right AND left... 
&gt; Does anyone know what is happening?

I think the observation you meant to describe is, Both right and left dash
lights flash no matter what direction signal is selected,,

and that is correct,, and that is the way the Dash is wired,, Vw made it this
way, there is only one signal warning light connection from the emergency
flasher relay , but there is 2 dash lamps,, both wired to flash at the same time

if both the lamps are not flashing when the directional signals are operated,,
then maybe you have a bad connection to that lamp... or a burnt out lamp,, or a
bad ground... 

&gt;So I switched so the split off from left to right, but no blinking on either of them

what is a split,, the wire connections??  
I would suggest you change the lamp from one side to the other,, or test it to
prove that you have 2 working lamps,, then go looking for the bad connection

hope that helps!
