Subject: bus owners

I don't know about y'all, but I've seen a LOT of nice busses (and bugs)
bought by the slam 'em crowd.  The first time you see the bus, its nice.
Next thing you know, its slammed.  Then its primered, which I've never
understood.  Thats as far as these cars get.  I remember seeing one such
example for sale, and when I looked at the engine, I noticed it didn't have
the fresh-air hoses on it.  I pointed this out to the owner, and he gave me
an irritated &quot;So?&quot;  Well, don't ya know you'll overheat it?  &quot;So?&quot;  

There is another case of a european (semaphore) oval running around town,
slammed to the ground, huge motor in it, flames rattle-canned on the front.
Every time you see it, its more jacked up than the last.  Sure, its a fast
car, but you could have done the same thing to a super-beater, and prolly
with better results.  There is also a certain barndoor standard around town
thats so low to the ground the roaches have to duck.

These things kinda turn my stomach, but you just have to live with it.
Thats why I created the hall of shame page, to highlight some of these
examples of VW botch-ulism, as kind of a catharsis for my inner rage.

I have never bought a running, driving bus; in fact, of all the VW's I've
owned, I've only bought one that was: the very first one.  All the others
have been bought from people who attempted to &quot;restore&quot; them, lost interest,
pulled some parts off them, and sold 'em.  Even the '54: it has a lot of
shitty work done on it from butchers long gone.
