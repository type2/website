Subject: Re: Arcocamper?

Hello,

the Arcomobil was a very expensive camper, costs more than the well
known Westfalias. This Campers had an isolated roof and not a poptop
canvas roof like the Westies. These campers are very rare. I know here
in Germany (from pictures and meetings) three T1 Splitties and two T2
baywindows as Arcomobil Campers. There was a test in 1968 in a German
Motor Magazine ...
