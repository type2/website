Greetings..

Quick question..

Should the vacuum hose that connects to the front of the vacuum advance on
the dizzy be connected to the vacuum port on the intake manifold (left) or
the vacuum port on the front of the carb (34pict 3).  The bus is a 71, 1600
dp.

Mine was originally connected to the intake, but a mechanic (whom I don't
really trust, to be honest) told me that they always connected it to the
front of the carb...

Perhaps it doesn't matter as both spots offer adequate vacuum for the dizzy
to operate correctly...

Or does it?

Cheers,

Tom
