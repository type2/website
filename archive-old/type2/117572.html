Subject: Re: [T2] stopping rust in tubes, was POR 15

&gt; &gt;From what I read, and have seen on this POR product--it is a no more

&gt; The stuff comes out of my primer gun like glue-( I can't spray it using
&gt; any of my finishing guns--it's way too thick and won't pass through the

&gt; Folks out there are using the POR stuff to attempt to stop something

a slight change of topiic, but how do you stop/prevent rust on the INSIDE
of metal tubes, like the axle beams on a Bus??   especially for the
individual who does not have a large shop and is only trying to save one
bus, their own
