HOW WE SPENT OUR SUMMER VACATION
By George, Marie, Claire, and Tempest
Part 1 of 4, California, Nevada

The following is a blow-by-blow account of this summer^Òs trip in our ^Ò71
station wagon.  For those who are into statistics, look at the end.

Our general philosophy is one of waking up and deciding which direction
to head.  We have a few favored destinations that we head for if we get
nearby.  Sometimes we^Òll stay in a place for several days if we don^Òt
run out of things to do.  We avoid interstates like the plague, and
instinctively head for the thinnest lines on the map.  We also tend to
avoid big cities and national parks if we can.  We live in a crowded
place and we don^Òt want to go to even more crowded ones for our
vacation!  As far as accommodations, we tend to look for little motels. 
We can camp if we have to, but it^Òs not our normal mode.  We also tend
towards little cafes for our food needs.

For traveling, we take out the middle seat.  The kids sit on the back
seat and four Rubbermaid bins occupy the floor (stacked two high). 
These contain books, toys, snacks, and emergency cold weather clothes
(hah!). The rear cargo area is occupied with soft luggage (with our
clothes), the spares box, and the foam pads and sleeping bags.  Keeping
all the soft stuff back there really cuts down on the engine noise! A
Coleman ice chest sits behind the passenger seat to serve our beverage
and snack needs.  Three ham radios under the dash keep us in touch.

Canyon Country CA
Ready to go!  The bus was given an 800-mile shakedown two weeks before,
heading up to Carson City, NV and back.  Rear tires are a bit worn, but
time is fleeting and I figure that they have a few more thousand miles
in them.  No problems are evident, so we strap the family in and off we
go!  We tend to drive along at 58-60 MPH, which is 70 on the bus^Òs
optimistic speedometer.  The &quot;real&quot; speed shows on the GPS gadget, but
the speedo number is much more impressive!  We head north on CA SR14.

Acton, CA
Palmdale, CA
Lancaster, CA
Acton used to be a real &quot;country&quot; place, but is increasingly a &quot;rich
yuppie&quot; place.  This leads to some interesting combinations like a
million-dollar mega-house being built right next to a shack make of
corrugated iron.  The yuppies seem to be winning, though!  Palmdale and
Lancaster are &quot;bedroom communities&quot; filled with a quarter of a million
people who jump in their cars and commute the 60 miles to LA every day. 
Land values here are low enough that you can buy a house for under
$200K, but you drive cars into the ground if you have to commute! 
Luckily, we were traveling in the opposite direction to their 3-lane
traffic jam.

Rosamond, CA
Mojave, CA
Rosamond is next to Edwards Air Force Base.  If you watched &quot;The Right
Stuff,&quot; then you know that this is where the speed of sound was broken
by a manned aircraft for the first time.  The Base was known as &quot;Muroc&quot;
at that time.  Mojave is the home of the Civilian Flight Test Center,
and is the birthplace of the &quot;Voyager&quot; airplane that went around the
world without refueling.  Like all good ideas, the Voyager was first
sketched on a napkin in a local diner.

Pearsonville, CA
Self-proclaimed &quot;Hubcap Capital of the World&quot;.  Not much else there. 
Kept going north on US395

Olancha, CA
Started to feel a vibration in the bus here.  This bugs me, since the
bus doesn^Òt have too much to vibrate.  It gets a bit worse, so we stop
at a handy rest area to check things out.  Left rear tire isn^Òt exactly
round anymore.  Tread separation.  (insert sound of George kicking
himself for not getting new tires before trip here)  Oh well, We^Òll
spend a couple of days in Carson City and get new tires then.  Slap on
the spare and off we go.

Lone Pine, CA
Independence, CA
Big Pine, CA
These are all nice little towns in a hidden corner of California.  I^Òm
not exactly sure what you would do for a living here, but the tourist
definitely doesn^Òt want to speed as they pass through town.  We escape
unharmed.  Further down the highway I feel a hint of the same danged
vibration that I felt before.  Could it be^Å?

Bishop, CA
Sure enough, a check of the _right_ rear tire reveals that it has
followed its mate to the great rubber graveyard.  Two tread separations
in one day!  Is somebody telling me that this trip isn^Òt such a good
idea?  Naaah!  Anyway, I^Òm out of spare tires (a situation I hope never
to be in again, as I now carry two!).  I dropped the wife and kids off
at the city park (Bishop has a _great_ city park!) and headed out in
search of rubber.  There^Òs a VW-friendly place just north of Bishop, so
I stopped in to see if they could help me find a tire.  Sat around for a
half-hour listening to the owner explain to a customer on the phone why
owning a water-cooled Vanagon was like owning a Rolls-Royce. (&quot;If you
have to ask the price of the parts, you should sell it immediately!&quot; or
somesuch).  He pointed me at two tire places.  The first place carried
the Yokohama that seems to be the current favorite, at $80 a pop!  I
wasn^Òt in the mood to quibble, so I tell them to go ahead and mount
two.  &quot;Sorry, we only have one of those&quot;.  I wasn^Òt going to drop $80 on
a tire for which I might not be able to find a mate, so on to the second
shop.  &quot;Tire Shack&quot; isn^Òt so much of a shack as it is a mobile home on a
back street, but the guy was friendly.  I ask him if he has a 185R14
load range D tire.  &quot;Nope.&quot;  &quot;How about anything that^Òll get me 200
miles up the road?&quot;  &quot;Yep, it^Òll cost you $10 if you take your old tire
with you.&quot;  Cool.  A half-hour later we^Òre on the road with a new used
tire.

Mammoth Lakes, CA
Didn^Òt see any purple busses driving about.  Her Majesty must be on a
road trip of her own.

Lee Vining, CA
Stopped at the park to let the kids blow off some steam.  The small
museum there was closed, but we^Òd seen it before.

Bridgeport, CA
Coleville, CA
Topaz, CA
Three pretty little towns.  Don^Òt buy gas in Bridgeport, unless you want
your wallet cleaned!  The locals must truck in their own!  On the way
out of town we pass the Ascuaga Cattle Company ranch, owned by the guy
who also owns the Nugget casino in Reno (actually, Sparks).  Looks like
a nice spread.  Coleville and Topaz would be great places to live if
they would just move the Nevada line a few miles southwest.  It^Òs too
expensive to live in CA!

Gardnerville, NV
Minden, NV
These are two small towns that grew together.  If you^Òre a carnivore,
you should try the prime rib at Sharkey^Òs in the middle of town.  The
place is a museum of cowboy, boxing, and circus memorabilia.  The
tabletops have hundreds of coins, medallions, campaign buttons, medals,
etc. encased in clear plastic.  You keep moving the plates around so
that you can see all the stuff!  There are also a couple of excellent
Basque restaurants in town, the best being the Overland Hotel.  They
serve in the traditional Basque style where you get an empty plate and
large bowls of wonderful food are placed on the table, just like back
home with Mama!  Minden and Gardnerville have been plagued with a influx
of California retirees (nothing against Californians, I was born there
myself, but they seem to bring with them a sort of suburban sameness,
instant subdivisions, and Starbucks coffee that sticks in my craw^Å), but
the older places in town have pretty much stayed the same

Carson City, NV
Ah, home.  Well, not quite, as the population has quadrupled since I
lived there.  Spend a few days with Dad, get the tire situation squared
away, and visit with my brother and sister in law who were also off on a
trip of their own.  My in-laws have a massive 4WD Ford Crewcab truck
with a 10 foot Alaskan camper.  They were having some fun of their own,
as they managed to fade their brakes going over one of the more
impressive Sierra passes.  After bleeding, their brakes felt much
better.  Perhaps those medieval barbers were on to something?

Tire Quest, Part 2.  Went to see a listee (Jim Duncan) who runs a VW
shop south of town.  He pointed me at a couple of places.  The first
didn^Òt have what I wanted and tried to sell me some wide low-profile
numbers.  Nope.  The second (a Goodyear outlet) cheerfully said that he
had exactly what I needed, went into the back and came back long-faced. 
He normally stocks 185R14 load range D tires, but his partner had sold
them the day before.  (side note:  Seems he sold them to the local
U-Haul dealer, and that something U-Haul rents uses that size.  Could be
useful info in the next tire search!)  He called his suppliers and the
tire was back ordered 2-weeks.  Not a good sign!

Went back to Dad's house, and pulled out the phone book.  Started
calling places in Reno (30 miles away).  Called the Firestone dealers
(who also carry Bridgestone) and hit pay dirt on the second call.  The
place has four in stock, but they^Òre backed up (just before the July 4
weekend) and can^Òt work on my car for a couple of days.  What if I just
bring the wheels?  No problem!  I grab the offending wheels, jump into
my Dad^Òs Chevy van and head for Reno.  The tire store was really
jumping, but they got the tires (Bridgestone RD-603 185R14LT load range
&quot;D&quot;) mounted and balanced pretty quickly.

Next day, took the in-laws and the kids to the Northern Nevada Railway
Museum.  This excellent museum has several pieces of rolling stock from
old Virginia and Truckee railway.  Since it was the Fourth of July, they
had taken the jewel of their collection, the wood-burning steam engine
&quot;Inyo,&quot; and steamed it up for the event.  Jeff, my brother-in-law is a
huge fan of steam railroading and particularly of the V&amp;T.  He seemed to
be quite pleased to be standing on the operating antique engine that he
had modeled in his youth!  Everybody took a ride around the &quot;loop&quot; on
another steam train.

Later on, Jeff and I went up to Virginia City.  This is the historic
Comstock Lode mining town, now pretty much gone over to extracting money
from tourists who grew up watching &quot;Bonanza.&quot;  Growing up in the same
region as the show was set, I always wondered how Pa, Hoss, and Little
Joe could ride from The Ponderosa at Lake Tahoe to Virginia City in a
matter of minutes.  It^Òs really a 50-mile ride down one mountain, across
a valley, around a lake, and over another mountain.  Hollywood editing,
I suppose.

At Virginia City, we walked the board sidewalks, had a burger and headed
down to the remnant of the V&amp;T that is running between Virginia City and
Gold Hill.  The rolling stock isn^Òt authentic, but the engine is steam
and the right-of-way is original.  While we were looking around the gift
shop, Jeff noticed a sign saying &quot;This is not a theme park ride.  You
may get a bit dirty, particularly if you ride on the engine.&quot;  Jeff
blurts &quot;you mean that we can ride on the _engine_!&quot;  Jeff did some
dealing involving the purchase of a coffee-table book and we had a
scribbled note that said &quot;OK to ride on engine.&quot;  We climbed up and
started our ride down to Gold Hill.  The fireman gave us a good
description of the operating controls as the engine swayed and jerked
down the rails as we stood between the tender and engine, hanging firmly
onto the oily grab bars.  Not exactly an OSHA-approved attraction, but
Nevadans have quite a bit if faith that you won^Òt do stupid things.  We
each burnt up a roll of film trying to capture the experience!  On the
way back, the engine was traveling  the correct direction and we got a
real taste of how a steam-train engineer lived.  Imagine a nice warm
summer day.  Now cozy up to a very warm boiler.  Now travel through a
continuous cloud of smoke and steam emanating from the front of the
engine.  Now go through a tunnel and concentrate all of the above! 
Those engines were driven by real men!

Dayton, NV
Left Carson City heading east on US50.  Dayton used to be a sleepy
little ex-railroad town, but now features booming subdivisions,  18 hole
golf courses,  &quot;Luxury Ranchettes.&quot;  Sheesh!

Silver Springs, NV
Crossroads of US50 and US95.  Gas station.  Bar.  Fertilizer plant.

Fallon, NV
A nice little farming community, home of the first big reclamation
project, which irrigated the entire valley and turned scrub desert into
productive alfalfa fields.  There^Òs a nice museum here, and breakfast at
the Stockman^Òs was ample and cheap.

Austin, NV
Eureka, NV
Both near-ghost towns on US50, the &quot;Loneliest Road in America&quot;  They
exist in what one of my friends calls &quot;arrested decay,&quot; surviving on the
gas, motel, and tourist trade.  Lots of history here, all jammed into
the 30 years that they boomed.  Don^Òt buy gas here if you can avoid it,
as it will run you $1.60 a gallon, the most expensive of the trip.  We
left US50 here and headed up NV278.

Carlin, NV
Elko, NV
Unlike Austin and Eureka, Carlin and Elko are currently booming, due to
extensive gold mining activity in the hills to the north.  Times have
changed, though, as the miners have traded their mules for luxury buses
as transportation to work, and the dugout huts have been replaced with
hundreds of mobile homes.  Elko had a very nice municipal pool, great
playground for the kids, and a good Basque restaurant (The Star Hotel). 
The Elko Motel was inexpensive and friendly.  Unfortunately, the only
way to travel west-to-east in this region is on I-80.

Deeth, NV
Wells, NV
Oasis, NV
All three of these towns suffer the fate of not being far enough away
from their neighbors to attract much tourist business.  Modern cars have
too much fuel tank range and overall reliability to require towns to be
very close together.  Deeth and Oasis are just about dead, while Wells
holds on grimly as I-80 traffic whizzes by..

Montello, NV
Tiring of I-80, we switched to NV233.  Montello is so far off the beaten
path that they don^Òt really care if you stop!  This is a meeting place
for local ranchers to pick up their mail and hoist a beer or two.
