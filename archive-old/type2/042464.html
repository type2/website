Subject: Vacuum advance hose routing

I have a 1974 Bus...stock 1800 cc motor.
I am changing back to vac adv distributor and need to
know correct placement of hoses.....
Left Solex carb has two nipples..right carb has one
The dist. has canister with two oulets..
Currently all hoses are hookd up to left carb, with the
right carb nipple being blocked off..
The back of canister(flat side) has hose going to
base of carb...and other hose to nipple approx
1/2 way up carb.
Is this correct?? Should other carb be hooked up as well?
Or doesn't matter??

The Bentley manual is rather silent on this topic.

Thx,
Glen
