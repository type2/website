Subject: better seat belts?

My wife took the bus on its maiden trip since we bought it about 2 months ago.
It ran fine, great in fact.  But she wants retractable seat belts.  Any belts
transfer straight across that I could go to the U PULL IT and get that would
slap right in?  Any body done this ?  I am aware of the aftermarket rollup
things...

thanks
