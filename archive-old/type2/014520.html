&lt;&lt; I am getting paranoid about installing new parts in my bus.  &gt;&gt;

i also have had a bunch of nasty parts come out of my *vw specific* FLAPS.  
example:  needed front wheel bearings.  bought a set.  they were made in 
china and were very loose and sloppy.  went to a national parts store who 
ironically sold beck/arnley parts and the set of wheel bearings from them 
were nice and tight, lifetime warranty ( which by the way is like pulling 
teeth to get a warranty on anything at our vw FLAPS) and were cheaper in 
price. 

c.v. boots.--- need i say more about not getting good quality or a warranty 
on those??

i too have had more luck pulling salvage yard parts, than new stuff also.  i 
wish there were companies who regularly checked the quality of the stock the 
purchased.  until then i am gonna continue to shop around.
