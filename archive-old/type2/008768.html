I know this is a little late, but I've been in Detroit on business (saw 1
Vanagon)

I just looked at the EGR filter that is lying next to my exhaust down
cellar.  I peeked though the numerous rust holes and saw *absolutely
nothing* - Yep, nothing , nada, zilch, nitchsnay,  was inside.  So
obviously, they contain only metal eating bacteria (ferrous-ravenous I
believe) - I suggest that you remove these things from your busses
immediately before the ferrous-ravenous escapes and starts eating the
body panels.  What? - your bus is already rusted - See I told you!

81 Westy - rust free, ok serious rot free
