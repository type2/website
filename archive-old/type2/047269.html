I would work on the jetting and carb set up to match it to the unique needs of
your engine.  However, prior to any carb tuning, perform a complete tune up,
plugs, points, cap, rotor, valve adjust, wires if needed (over two years old.)
Every thing else should be close to perfect prior to setting up a new carb.
