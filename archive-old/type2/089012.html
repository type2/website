Subject: Last Dixie Bus Post

Well at least until the trip reports and pictures!  Thank you to those who
have endured and praised these necessary posts.

To those last minute partakers...

www.geocities_dot_com/Dixie_Bus_Gathering

A few necessary requests..

1.  When entering the campground, please use 1st gear.  The owners get very
excited about faster than necessary traffic.

2.  If arriving later than 9 pm, drive through the camp to the blue
building, veer right around the building, and there is a drive off to the
right that will take you to our group area.

3.  We have reserved a conservative area, not knowing how many to expect.
If I am not available, please park in an organized manner.  whatever that
means.

4.  I have 40 pounds of ground turkey to pre cook, 8 pounds of veggies, and
about 42 pounds of chili beans and tomatoes...I may need a little help.

5.  Please bring your own table settings.  I have not properly planned to
have eating utensils supplied.

I am out of here.  C you all at Dixie Bus!
