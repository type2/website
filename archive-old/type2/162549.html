&gt;     With my new found treasure from the local junkyard (GD 2000cc engine), I'd
&gt; like to start planning the engine rebuild for my Bus. With this engine, I'm
&gt; planning on actually using the dual carburetors that I have. The owner of my
&gt; Bus before me spent a LOT of money on a BRAND NEW set of dual carburetors and
&gt; never got around to installing them. I'll probably use these then.
&gt;
&gt; With all of that said... the GOAL for my engine rebuild is to have an engine
&gt; that puts out as much power as it safely and reliably can. Reliability is very
&gt; important to me more so than power. I will welcome the extra power because I
&gt; am assuming that I would get better fuel economy for when I want to take it on
&gt; a road trip or drive around town.

if you want the maximum reliability and power then it is almost mandatory
that you put the fuel injection system back into the engine.  Carbs may
look nice but you can believe that VW didn't go to fuel injection because
it was easier or cheaper, but because it was what got the most out of that
engine.  also better MPG too.
