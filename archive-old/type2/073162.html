Subject: Re: Rant on welding flanges on heater boxes
Message-Id: &lt;v03110708b3788d043695_at_[24.92.77.32]&gt;

I've installed my flanges with gaskets in place to try to address alignment
issues. This ruins the gaskets so you have to have two sets.

But Hoover said once:

&gt;With the heater-boxes installed -- with gaskets -- slide your bolted-together
&gt;pairs of flanges over the heater-box tubes where the muffler will go.  Now
&gt;install the muffler, bolting it to the #2 &amp; #4 exhaust stacks WITHOUT GASKETS.
&gt;Do not install the carb-heat tube, nor the plenum chambers -- leave those
&gt;parts loose.  Position the flanges, making sure they are reasonably square.
&gt;Tack-weld the flanges to BOTH the heater boxes (on each side) and to the
&gt;muffler (on each side).  User at least three good tack-welds on each flange.
&gt;
&gt;Unbolt the flanges.  Unbolt the muffler from the exhaust stacks.  The muffler
&gt;can now be removed, leaving a pair of perfectly aligned flanges on the heater
&gt;boxes and antoher pair on the muffler.
&gt;
&gt;Finish up your welding.  Be sure to allow for the hardware.
&gt;
&gt;When you put things back together WITH GASKETS you will now have the proper
&gt;relationship between the heat-exchanger, the rear-most two exhaust stacks and
&gt;the new muffler.
&gt;
&gt;--------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;If your flanges do not accurately fit your plumbing (they won't) use NAILS to
&gt;postion them.  Nails come in all diameters.  Three (or more) nails,
&gt;equadistant, wedged between the exhaust pipe and the hole in the flange will
&gt;hold the flange concentric to the pipe.  If the nails you have are too fat,
&gt;flatten a couple with a hammer.  You can tack-weld right over them, if you
&gt;wish, or simply throw them away once the flange is tacked to the pipe.
&gt;Remember, you can add rod to fill a gap, even when MIG welding.
&gt;
&gt;I think VW pipes are 1-3/8&quot; but the most commonly available two-bolt flange is
&gt;1-1/2&quot;.  That's only a sixteenth of an inch, assuming you can hold them
&gt;concentrically.  That's where the nails come in.  I'm not sure what size nails
&gt;I use -- I've got lotsa nails :-)
&gt;
&gt;After doing the flanges, go buy some 5/16&quot; stainless steel hardware.  And even
&gt;then, slather the stuff with anti-sieze.  Be sure to use lock-washers (which
&gt;may be carbon steel).
&gt;
&gt;--------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;Try to keep things neat &amp; square. When it comes time to replace the muffler it
&gt;makes things a lot easier.  (ie, welding a pair of flanges to the new muffler,
&gt;positioned by the pair of flanges already welded to the heat-exchangers).
&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;You'll have to deal with the flange on the muffler.  I cut it off.

In any case you want to bolt it up, tack weld it, then take it apart to
finish the welding. Welding it up with muffler on the bus seems like a good
way to get third-degree burns to me. 8)

Believe me, you aren't the only bad welder. Usually all I accomplish is to
weld my vise-grips to stuff and use a tremendous amount of wire that
somehow gets vaporized.
