Subject: Re: [T2] Welders, white courtesy phone...

I've been playing with my buddy's Miller &quot;Cricket&quot; 110v wire welder and
before he starts chargin' me an hourly rental, I've decided to buy mine
own...
The Lincoln 3200 Weld-Pak... Anybody familiar with it? It seems to be
a Home Depot &quot;special&quot; (bundled by Lincoln for HD alone ?-(
OTOH, if anyone is upgrading to a bigger/better machine, I'd be inter-
ested in buying a similar welder from you...;-)
