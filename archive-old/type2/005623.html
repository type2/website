Subject: Late model transmission in 73 bus
Date: Fri, 20 Apr 2001 05:45:23 -0400

I understand that a late model(76-79) bus tranny could swap directly with my
73.  I am interested in doing this because the later model transmissions
have a taller 4th gear, thus allowing fewer rpm's at say 70 mph.

Anyone done this, or swapped the gear themselves in an early transmission?
