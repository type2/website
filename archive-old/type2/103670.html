Subject: F.I. to Carb clarification

I asked a couple of days ago about converting a F.I.
engine to carbs. Let me clarify my question. I am
considering taking a F.I. engine from a 79 bus and
putting into a non-F.I. 72 bus. And I am wondering
what would be easiest, to convert the F.I. engine to
carb, or to remove all the additional F.I. stuff such
as wiring, FI brain, etc, and transplanting the whole
system into a bus that is not wired for it. 
If the latter, what ALL would have to be removed from
the F.I. bus to go into the non FI 72 bus, and where
can I mount all the stuff?
