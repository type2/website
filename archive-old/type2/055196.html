Subject: Re: flywheel replacement

Matt Bushore sends:

&gt; My flywheel has a smallish groove worn in it from the seal
&gt; rubbing.  Do the reconditioned units have no groove at all?
&gt; Or is some kind of wear acceptable?

Is this groove (1) on a Type 1 flywheel and (2) on the non-clutch side of
the flywheel, inside the hub area? If it's there, that's not wear--the PO
forgot to put the O-ring into the machined groove in the flywheel.

If it's on the outside of the hub area, I'd just deburr it and go with it
the way it is.
