&lt;I'm still a great believer in &quot;miles per vehicle&quot;.  My bus is still pretty
hard to beat on that measure!&gt;

AND how!!!

And measuring pollution as pollution per mile rather than parts per million which helps the big SUV's and pickups look pretty clean (and they are compared to their 30 year old cousins). Yeha the PPM may be small but there are alot of millions of parts to measure in the first place!!! &lt;grin!&gt; 

Proud to say my aged '97 VW Cabrio (130K miles almost) turned in 31 mpg around town last week. Of course my '78 Westy hasn't used a take of gas in over 5 years!!! (and I haven't driven it for longer than that either... &lt;grin!&gt;)
