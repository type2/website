Internet Cleaning
DO NOT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET FROM MARCH 31st 23:59 pm (GMT) UNTIL 12:01am 
(GMT) APRIL 2nd.

*** Attention ***

It's that time again!  As many of you know, each year the Internet must be 
shut down for 24 hours in order to allow us to clean it. The cleaning 
process, which eliminates dead e-mail and inactive ftp, www, and gopher 
sites, allows for a better working and faster Internet.

This year, the cleaning process will take place from 23:59 pm (GMT) on March 
31st until 00:01 am (GMT) on April 2nd. During that 24-hour period, five 
powerful Internet-crawling robots situated around the world will search the 
Internet and delete any data that they find.

In order to protect your valuable data from deletion we ask that you do the 
following:
  1. Disconnect all terminals and local area networks from
     their Internet connections.
  2. Shut down all Internet servers, or disconnect them
     from  the Internet.
  3. Disconnect all disks and hardrives from any
     connections to the Internet.
  4. Refrain from connecting any computer to the Internet
     in any way.

We understand the inconvenience that this may cause some Internet users, and 
we apologize. However, we are certain that any inconveniences will be more 
than made up for by the increased speed and efficiency of the Internet, once 
it has been cleared of electronic flotsam and jetsam.

We thank you for your cooperation.
(And, have a happy April Fools Day.)

 . . . . . . . . . . . .It's Friday!!!
Bob
