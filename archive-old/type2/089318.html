Subject: Universal / Tiger CDIs

Listmembers,

Universal is discontinuing the production and sale of the Tiger CDIs they've
been selling for a long time. We bought the remaining inventory, and I'm
offerring them to T-2 listmembers first. We only have about 15 units, so I
don't expect them to stick around long.

I made Universal promise to maintain (fix any broken ones) for a 2 year
period, even though they won't be selling them any longer. Universal is
under new ownership, and they may have a replacement model in the future,
but we have no idea when, and what it will be. Many listmembers already have
this unit, they are simple, and easily revert to &quot;conventional ignition&quot; if
something craps out, so you aren't stranded due to any failure in the CDI
itself.

To sweeten the deal, I'll eat the shipping on them, and any other parts in
the same order, PROVIDED it's not something thats super expensive to ship
(floor pans, engine, etc). Be sure to mention &quot;T2 Listmember&quot; in the special
instructions field when you order to get the special deal.

John
