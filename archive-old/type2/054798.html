Subject: Re: engine from 79 into 73?

Hi Volks!

tgtsfkncld &lt;tgtsfkncld_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt; (signed &quot;dave&quot;) wrote to the List:
&gt;     Can i take a 2000cc from a 79 and put it in a 73?  The 73 has a 1600
&gt; in it at the present time.  No one wants a 1600 when they could have a
&gt; 2000 with hydro. lifters.  I know all the computer stuff has to go, and
&gt; all that.  I just want to know if it will fit to the transmission and
&gt; the body.  And if the trans isn't the same, can I take the 79 trans,
&gt; too?

Don't know about trannies, except that there is a difference
between 1600cc (Type 1 engine) and 1700..2000cc (Type 4 engine)
trannies.  I *think* they're interchangeable though.

&gt;From '72, Type 4 engines fit into Buses.  There's a lot of
small items to be changed, or so I'm told (never having attempted
to do, well, anything to a Type 4), but the general body is
the same.

&gt;     Nuts.  I just remembered.  The 79 is automatic.  New question.  Can
&gt; I take the 2000 auto and put it in the standard 73?  Alternatively, can
&gt; I take the 2000 and the auto trans and put the whole deal in the 73, and
&gt; please remind me again why I don't want to do that?

Don't know if you can mate an auto engine to a manual tranny,
I'd guess no.  You can install an auto engine and tranny
into a manual bus, a pal of mine has such a beast.  I'd
discourage it.  You get worse gas mileage, more maintenance
hassle and parts problems, and not that much better
performance to show for it.

But then, I've always been a Type 1 engine guy, so maybe
I'm biased.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
