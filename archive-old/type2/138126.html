&gt; Does not sound like it could happen. Are you sure you have power to 
&gt; the sockets?
&gt; Or did you actually loose the resister in the headlight switch?

and Gerald agreed:
&gt;&gt; I seriously doubt all of the bulbs burned out at the same time. 
&gt;&gt; Probably
&gt;&gt; none of them did. Burning out a bulb requires an over-voltage 
&gt;&gt; situation or
&gt;&gt; old age.

But....
All (3) bulbs connected at the time were blown.  &quot;In theory there's no 
difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is.&quot;  I 
don't get it either, but the replacements work fine.

I found a decent replacement at the FLAPS, tight but possible without 
cursing fit.  They had 3 EIKO brand models that were impossible to tell 
apart inside their blister packs.  A touch skinnier base would have 
been perfect.  Maybe I'll try a different one in 25 years when these 
blow (assuming I keep my hamfists out from behind the dash).

cheers,
