&gt; Getting the sliding door off without dropping it is an interesting
&gt; exercise. You''d be best to get a helper for the job if at all

yes but if you must

&gt; There are four bolts inside the bus holding the U-bracket to the rear
&gt; door at the beltline. Once those are removed the U-bracket can be

remove 3 and lossen the 4th

&gt; pulled from the door, and the rear of the door will be hanging loose.
&gt; If you then remove the bolts from the lower slider arm you can swing
&gt; the door outwards from the bottom and remove it from the bus.

take the bottom off and place on jack or jackstand.


remove 4th bolt,
tighten hernia belt
remove last bolt on U-braket
lift door and slide out of door frame.


installation is reverse of removal with the addition of extra cursing
