Subject: AllData CD-ROM for Aircooled VW's

To whom it may concern,

I have visited your web-site and am impressed with your product. However
I have been notified of a lack of your CD-ROM product for Aircooled
VW's.

I currently own a 1974 VW Type 181 (Thing), and a 1979 VW Campmobile.
Both of which are aircooled.  I would be most interested in obtaining a
set of shop manuals, but the option of having them on CD-ROM would be a
far better choice than having hard copy versions. 

I have heard rumblings, through the internet VW community, that such a
product would be widely appreciated. There has also been some rumors,
that your company may be considering such a product.  I can say that if
such a product is made available to the Aircooled VW community, it would
garner much support, not only from myself, but from countless other VW
owners, who are interested in maintaining their vehicles.

I have spoken with other people who have used your product for other
vehicles, and they have made very good comments about the quality of
information available on the CD's.  I would only hope that such a tool
becomes available for the Aircooled VW community.


Regards

David Goldberg
