Karl I've got the same scenario.
I'm useing an 87 Audi GT sending unit that screws directly into the oli
bypass valve (replacing the stock plug) I'm showing 130 celsius or about
266 degrees faremheit.
To convert Celsius temperatures into Fahrenheit:
Begin by multiplying the Celsius temperature by 9. 
Divide the answer by 5. 
Now add 32. 
Most list members claim to running about 240 degrees farenheit but
although my oil temp is reading high I don't think the oil is realy 266
hot. 
My engine is new and I'd suspect that it may drop some after breakin.
The outside temperature here in Texas has been between 90 nand 100 daily
so I'd expect a little hot. Around town just average driving I'm running
212 to 220, but a highway speeds it climbs on up there to 266.
