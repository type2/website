Weston,

Thanks!

The rest of you,

First returns are in!  Keep those cards and letters coming! the more data
points I get, the better the final results will be!

&gt; &gt;What I would like to do is ask all of you who do vacuum reading as part of
&gt; &gt;your normal maintainance to let me know the following:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;vacuum guage reading,
&gt; &gt;miles on engine,
&gt; &gt;engine displacement,
&gt; &gt;original/ rebuilt engine.
&gt;
&gt; Naturally I ran right out to check and indeed the reading is 15&quot;hg( &quot;inches
&gt; of mercury&quot; per the book rather than the opposite psi). This is an 81 with
&gt; 107k and 3k on a topend rebuild.
&gt;
&gt; The manual for the &quot;Mityvac&quot; that I use says 16 to 22 is normal for a gas
&gt; engine with less than that described as inefficient. It goes on to describe a
&gt; steady reading of 15 as due to either late timing or an intake manifold leak.
&gt;
&gt; I'll be interested in the definitive answer on this one.
