&gt;question at hand is Why do I have to jump up and down on my brake peddle
&gt;for me to stop.

Check your vaccum line.  There are three lines as I recall. One runs from
engine to pipe one runs from pipe to pipe one runs from pipe to booster.
That's probably the issue...if not it's gonna cost you.  The smaller lines
that are long, are easy to replace as I reccollect.  the bigger one was a
real pain, took longer than the other two combined.  I have great brakes
until next time.  I also upgraded to 73 spindles



 Just to recap, the bus was improperly stored in a dank
&gt;garage for about 6 years. I've spent the past 7 months or so working on
&gt;it. It now runs and is to the point of finally passing inspection. Back
&gt;to the brakes, it will stop, but an insane amount of pressure needs to
&gt;be applied to make it stop. Also, underneath, butted up against the
&gt;master cylinder, there is a UFO shaped thing that I can only assume is
&gt;the vacuum advance. Is there supposed to be a pin sized hole in it that
&gt;you can hear and feel a lot of suction coming from? 

No, I don't recall a hole this could be bad...

&gt;asked last time if anyone knew a good source for carpet underpadding for
&gt;a 71' microbus, mine literally melted away from mildew.

You had underpadding!!!!!????????  I have the &quot;Station Wagon&quot; with all the
chrome and such, I didn't get underpadding...no fair...Try a good carpet
store, or a cheap one and ask for the non-melting stuff.


&gt;
&gt;Thank you,
