I know this has been talked about before but I couldn't
find a good answer.  I am looking for a new battery and wonder
if it mattered what one I buy. I asked a guy at Autozone to check
the price on a battery for my bus and he said the only one that
would work is $50.  After looking through the archive I saw some people 
saying get a group 24 battery. The bently says I need a 54
amp hours battery.
Anyone got any suggestions on what kind to buy?
As in specs not brands, what works?

Thanks in advance

PS. Went camping last weekend and it rained most of the time
but we still had a wonderful time. We loved watching the
other people with tents scramble to pickup there tents
after it started pouring. Guess it got a little to wet for them ;)
