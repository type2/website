Subject: Subject Lines...Please Read...Administrative Droning...

Subject lines, from two different directions:

(1) I'm getting close on the searchable archive (I know, I've been saying
that for months, but it is hard). When it comes on-line, the search engine
will be sifting a database of subject lines, not full text. The very
selfsame subject lines as the ones on your messages, good listees.

That means: it is extra special important that the subject lines be as
accurate and as succinct as possible. Please think about this before
posting, particularly if you're starting a new thread; ideally, your
subject line should be such that it is very close to what your search query
would be if you were searching for the same information. Make sense?

It is in your interest to take the time to do this; if we make the
information easy and convenient to find, we might be able to avoid things
like:

- --The &quot;timing the 009&quot; question

- --The &quot;fuel gauge sender&quot; question

- --The &quot;what does FLAPS mean?&quot; question

and so forth. Nothing wrong with any of those, I have had all of them
myself, but it's dry reading them over and over, and people who are new are
less likely to get a good answer to a question that's been answered a
hundred times before. If we're meticulous about the subject lines, I think
it will relieve some of that tedium while making for a better resource for
bus newbies.

(2) Of course all this is defeated if you don't give us a subject line to
work with at all, or if you're on digest and don't paste the subject line
in. The archived messages will be threaded, so if you don't reply with the
proper subject line, your message is ditched.

Newbies, we're glad you're here, truly, but some of you seem to be unclear
on the concept. To neglect to tell us what your message is about is, by
convention, rude. We deal with a helluva lot of mail. Put your problem and
your year of manufacture IN THE HEADER. Thanks.
