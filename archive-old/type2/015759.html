&gt;Hi,Im new to type 2's but I am very dedicated to VWs.I have recently
purchased
&gt;a a 74 automatic. It sat in a barn for a couple of years an the carbs are all
&gt;gummed up. I dont know that I am experienced enough to rebuild them myself so
&gt;I called the neighborhood VW shop and they told me that they would'nt touch
&gt;them because there are bushings in the throttle body that will need to be
&gt;replaced and they cant do that there. They also said that you cant purchase
&gt;new carbsfor this model. I do know a little about cars and I am mechanicly
&gt;inclined is there a book that I can purchase to walk me through a
rebuild.What
&gt;other options do I have.Keep in mind that I am a student with very little
&gt;money to throw around.I was also own a 83 Rabbit GTI. I have herd of people
&gt;putting 1.8L ford motors in their busses. Is it possible to put my rabbit
&gt;motor in the bus. If so where can I get a conversion. 

Forget about the water cooled conversion if you are on a budget.  As for
the carb bushings, replacing the carb is ridiculous... why?  Because the
freakin throttle plates unbolt from the carbs!!  Any competent machine shop
should be able to rebush them.  BUT, your bus can run okay with worn
throttle shafts.  I ran that way for years.  You CAN get it to idle
smoothly.  You can compensate for the slight vacuum leak by richening your
idle mixture.  Now eventually you will get to a point to where the shaft
holes are way oval-shaped and then you will have to replace them, but don't
let the carb-nazis scare you into buying new carbs or converting to a Weber
until you've taken a close look at what you've got.  Try fixing the
stockers first and save yourself a bundle.  Rebuild kits are available -
try Bus Depot or RMMW, if they don't have them call Vee Parts in San Diego
at 619-477-4787.  They are under $15 each.  Clean them out well and see how
your bus runs.  If it still won't run right and you're POSITIVE that the
carbs are the problem, then consider the Weber conversion, but like any
aftermarket conversion you can expect to have problems with tuning,
installation, etc.  Or maybe you'll get lucky.  Good luck with it!
