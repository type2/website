Subject: Re: spark enhancer? better mileage?

Bob-
       First off, I'd be suspect of anything J.C. claims for products. As 
regards the e-
lectronics- I've used a Pertronix replacement for points for a few years now 
and al-
though my mileage didn't increase or decrease, my free time did. It's a set 
it and forget it installation and pretty cheap at about 50 bucks...no parts 
to wear out and
replace. I even have one in my Bugeye, so they're pretty universal as to 
application.
On the other hand, if you've got your heart set on this electronic marvel, 
I'd suggest
adding the infamous &quot;Fish&quot; carb...then your mileage would increase to 200 
mpg...or
even more by adding the &quot;Turbo-Boost&quot; inline fuel accelerator...
