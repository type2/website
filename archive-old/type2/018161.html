&gt; Hi Jarrett,
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks for all of the suggestions for my floor. When you put down
&gt; the Q-pads, what percentage of the sheet metal did you cover? 

I used 16 12&quot; tiles for the floor.  I guess that comes to about 60%.  My
opinion is that you don't really need to cover the whole floor to deaden
the worst vibrations.  That's what they're best at anyway.  

As I see it, there's two sorts of noise in a bus.  There's the normal
air-medium sound wave which will be similar to what you'd hear outside
the bus, only amplified, because you're in a big resonant chamber. 
Imagine yourself inside an acoustic guitar.  For this sort of noise
deadening I'm using fiberglass insulation and carpet padding.  Sound
waves stop when they encounter a medium through which they cannot pass. 
Foam has, for example, lots of dead space which makes it a poor wave conductor.

The Q-pads on the other hand are still dense enough that I think they'll
still they'll move air.  Not as much as bare metal, certainly, but to a
greater degree than foam or fiberglass insulation.

Where the Q-pads seem to function best is in reducing the amount of the
other type of noise, the vibration noise which will in turn contribute
to a greater amount of the first type.  This &quot;vibration noise&quot; (I
apologize to any sound engineers out there... feel free to comment on my
theory) is what we FEEL when we start those 4 cylinders banging around. 
Again, imagine the guitar.  You can put your palm on the soundboard
(that's the top for you non-music types) and you'll deaden some of the
vibration, but you'll still get noise.  Not as loud, but noise nonetheless.

Now of course this second type of noise contributes to the first, so
using the Q-pads to diminish the vibrations will increase the overall
&quot;quietness&quot; of your ride.  

I suppose if you wanted a truly silent bus you could cover everything
with Q-pads, and then insulate the hell out of everything.  Take a look
at any new &quot;quiet&quot; car today.  You'll see very little or no exposed
metal.  It's all covered up by foam and then faced with attractive
plastic finishing pieces.

But I for one don't want that.  It would be 1) cost prohibitive;  2) bad
for the bus.  I like to hear my bus engine somewhat, as I imagine most
bus owners do.  Our ears become one of our gauges, especially if you
haven't installed a tach.  It also helps us pick up on those subtle
signs that tell us the bus isn't completely happy.

&gt; I like the idea of doing this up right, but I am trying to be
&gt; penny wise when I can be (and I also try to defer big costs when I can).

I agree.  I actually just forked out the bucks for two cases of Q-pads
(that's 72 tiles).  I'm doing the whole interior (ceiling included).  By
ordering by the case (there's 6 packages to a case for the 12&quot; size) I
was able to talk the supplier into giving me $3 off each package, which
came to a savings of close to $40.  Not much, but then, every penny
counts.  If you were doing the whole floor you could do it with 3-4
packages, depending on how thorough you wanted to be.

Of course this brings up, as you mentioned in a later post, whether
there might be low-cost alternatives.  You mention in another post that
saved labor increases the cost.  My brother and I were talking about
this subject the other day.  In addition to labor concerns, often when a
general product meets a particular application, manufacturers will raise
the cost because they can claim specificity for the task at hand. 
People will pay.  Take a look at weddings for instance.  Want a cake or
flowers for a wedding?  Want it cheap?  Then don't mention that it's for
a wedding.  It automatically adds at least 50% to the price tag.  Same
damn flowers or flour as you'd have in your &quot;everyday&quot; sort of bouquet
or cake, though.  

Q-pads might be just such a product.  They're really only a self
adhesive rubber (although they might be made of the best SORT of rubber
for the job).  The one thing that the Q-pads have going for them are
that they're easy to use.  They're small enough that they can be easily
applied, you don't have to mess with adhesives, and you don't have to
try any &quot;workarounds&quot; to get the same effect.  I was able to warm them
up enough just by setting them in the sun--they're definitely a &quot;soft&quot;
sort of rubber.  Still, if I was doing it all over again knowing what I
do now, I'd probably look very closely at what else I could use for the job.

But I am happy with the result as I have it.  The only drawback to the
Q-pads is their expense.  But enough rambling!
