&gt;&gt; 	Well, after comming to grips with the fact that I bought a
&gt;&gt; Volkswagen.. :) something I thought I'd never do.. heh. I finally got my
&gt;&gt; 1973 Volkswagen Bus back home. I've spent the past 2 days working on the
car&gt;
&gt;
&gt;welcome

THanks!!

&gt;&gt; since I've gotten it. Basically.. long story short, the BUS has a brand
new
&gt;&gt; GEX 1.8 liter engine. The motor has less than 20 miles on it. The BUS
also
&gt;
&gt;start saving money NOW for a new engine or rebuild, GEX maybe one of the
&gt;worst rebuilders in existance, once in a while they get one right by
&gt;accident but 3,000 miles seems to be about average for how long they last,
&gt;sorry


Is there anything I can do? I've worked on engines before.. mostly GM V6/60s
and small block chevies, so.. worst case scenario, I could assemble and
dissasemble it myself, having only to pay for the new parts and the machine
shop. But are they REALLY that unreliable?


&gt;&gt; has a COMPLETELY new paint job... sort of a light blue body, with a white
&gt;&gt; top (from the dew strip gutter thing to the top is white).
&gt;
&gt;??? wonder how much that is hiding, hopefully nothing


	Actually, like I was telling that other guy, the car is in REALLY
good condition. I saw the car 6 years ago before it had any of the paint
work done to it.. and the only place where it was rusted was in the middle
on the drivers side roof gutter. The underside of the bus is original, not
rubber coated or anything, and is completely rust free.


&gt;&gt; The next thing is... I'm trying to replace a lot of the items that look
&gt;&gt; &quot;old&quot;. I want to replace all the chrome on the car... I'm thinking of
&gt;&gt; getting a whole new set of door locks, and the trunk-hatch door handle,
as
&gt;&gt; well as the commando door handle.
&gt;
&gt;more important, replace ALL gas lines, with high presure fuel injection
&gt;gas hose, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

&gt;replace the flexible brake lines, I would also replace the brake
&gt;pads/shoes

&gt;replace ALL fluids including oil/gas/transmission/brake fluid with good
&gt;quality new (remember manual transmissions need GL4 oil not the more
&gt;common GL5)


	I think you're right. Thanks for the advice. Where can I get GL4 oil
by the way?
I'd like to try to pick some up before this weekend. I'd like to try to get
it running sometime then.

&gt;but other wise sounds like you have a nice new ride
