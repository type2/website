I seem to remember a friend hot tanked his Beetle pedal cluster,, and all that
came out of the tank was nice shiny metal.. really nice, BUT no aluminum!

Don't  heat exchangers have aluminum fins inside?  Won't the hot tank chemical
destroy the aluminum?

YMMV
Good Luck

&gt; I'd have them hot tanked.  It wouldn't cost much, or be difficult to do, and

&gt; tanked give them a good coat of paint and you will be all set.
