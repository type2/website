Subject: Tools for Rescue Missions

In preparation for retrieving my '67 westy from Jed Clampit's place up in
the Ozarks, I made this list of things I might want to bring with me. It's
like a bus rescuer's tools, parts, and supplies list. Since I'm an amatuer,
I thought some of you more experienced rescuers might have suggestions. I'm
going after a '67 Westy that's been mostly neglected for about 10-15 years.
The engine has a relatively recent (4 years, less than 1000 miles) top- and
bottom-end rebuild by a machinist/country genius who knows about tolerances,
measuring, etc. It's been driven some every month or so, but hasn't been a
daily driver since the engine rebuild. Many buses have been more neglected
and have less potential, including a nearby parts bus I hope to ravage.

For my own benefit, I've marked the things I don't yet have with a + symbol.
The objective is to drive up with a truck and trailer, load Ken's single cab
onto the trailer, and drive my bus back. I may spend a day (or more if
needed) fixing stuff before I drive back. Please feel free to comment on
anything, in any way. I could especially use tips on how to keep from buying
so much extra stuff. I know I'll need most of it eventually, but I could
stand to wait until after Christmas and after a really good assessment of
this bus' condition (like in my own yard).

BTW, when I made this list, I intended it to be the start of a &quot;bus
rescuer's list&quot; with a personalized touch.

If you'll send replies directly to me, I'll compile a list and post it
tonight when I get home from work (giving you credit and inserting your
humor). This will help reduce list traffic. If everyone replied to the list,
we might have 20 or 30 extra posts today.

- ----------------

+Inner Tube
