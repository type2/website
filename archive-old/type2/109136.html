Cool.  Glad that you had a safe and fun trip.

While we're waiting, did anyone else ever notice the bay during the closing
credits of Mr. Roger's neighborhood?  It's either white/yellow, or
white/orange, and it's right after Mr. Rogers leaves the house and the
camera pans across the &quot;town&quot;.
