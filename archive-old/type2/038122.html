Subject: Bumper color

I have a 74 westy, thats orange, with BLUE bumpers.  I don't know what the
person was thinking when they decided to repaint the bumpers blue, with
spray paint might I add.  Anyway, here's what I want to do and here's my
problem.
I want to restore the original color to the bumpers (white)  but I dont know
how I should go about doing that.
