Subject: [T2] engine fan and tailpipe trouble

Upon inspection it
&gt;turned out the bolt holding the engine fan had come out and it was sticking
&gt;half way out of the engine. So I put it back in and tightened it as much as
&gt;possible. Is there anything else I need to do?

The fan normally unbolts from the hub with three bolts, the the center bolt
unlocks the hub. The hub can often be a bear to remove by itself.
You might remove the fan/hub the same way it fell apart to examine the key and the
crankshaft for damage, then reinstall the fan and hub separately in the correct fashion.
The fan locates with a pin.

As for the broken muffler studs, this is a very common problem.
grind the end of the stud flat, centerpunch ( very accurately) then carefully
drill dead center 1/8&quot; bit, and then work up drill sizes in stages ( to readjust an
off-center start ) to the proper bit and  M8 X 1.25 tap the remaining threads out.
 if this fails, retap with a 5/16 and it will work just fine. Use stainless bolts to install.
