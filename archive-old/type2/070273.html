Subject: '77 Camper - I own one now!

I just bought a '77 Camper. I was looking over the Bus summary FAQ and I
think it might not be a '77.

The reason I say this is that the window on the sliding door (which BTW
slides very smoothly) slides open, its not one of those crank jobs with
the small windows slats.

The FAQ says, &quot;The '79 busses also got sliding passenger windows too.
About time!&quot;  This leads me to believe it might be a '79 or is it only
referring to buses and not campers?

Where can I look (VIN #, etc.) to see check the year model more closely.


Thanks,
Patrick
