Tom/Derek,

I agree with you both...sounds like a vacuum leak. I
also agree that the 34/3 is a piece of crap (I have
one on my '69....I know).

I have looked for the original carb in rebuildable
condition, but no luck in 3 years. I've also looked at
a new German replacement (I forget the pict#....it's
been awhile), but it's pretty pricey. Hell, I could
get a good used  dual Webber and convert to dp heads
for another $50.00 (found a lady selling a barely used
&lt;less than 500mi&gt; webber and manifolds for $50.00)!!! 

Still, it gets very hot/cold here, and I don't really
want to lose those heat-risers (not to mention choke).

I think what is most telling about the 34/3, is that
the flaps won't even take it for the core charge on a
new carb! Not a good sign... Why they want a core for
a new carb is another story altogether;-)
