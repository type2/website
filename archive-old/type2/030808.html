&gt;to cut out the section (about 2 inches bigger than the actual opening)
&gt;&gt;from the back of a 73-79 bus, cut out the corresponding part of yours,
&gt;and have the replacement section welded in.

To heck with that!

I'm not a big fan of the cut and paste, but this is a seriously helpful
mod.

I have seen an even better one, though...  A Vanagon panel, neatly welded
in.  It's twice, maybe three times the size of the Bus opening.  And it
fits amazingly well, at least on the one I saw.  

It's like the Hardee's ads say.. If you're gonna go, go all the way.

Cheers-
