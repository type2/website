 Shelby,

  I've not seen anything specifically for the Ariba Puck trailers either.  I
have found several sites for other light-weight fiberglass trailers (some
still manufactured, some NLA) at the following:

Scamp Trailers - www.scamptrailers_dot_com

Casita Travel Trailers - casitatraveltrailers_dot_com


Yea, We use both of these in the Air Force all the time. They seem to work
and hold up well. The trailers are used every weekend year round. They are
small, light and trailer well.
