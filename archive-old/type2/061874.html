I removed the tank cover with the p-mail help of a couple of list members.
The leak seems to be at the filler neck rubber molded piece (it has a crack in
it)  The large performed rubber hose seems to be in good shape but I will
replace it with a straight hose and have a 90 degree tube fabricated at the
muffler shop on Monday.

If I recall others have said the filler neck rubber is no longer available
from VW, I will check this out also on Monday.  If it obsolete, what have
others used as a replacement?

I there are a two other small vent hoses in the compartment, they also will be
replaced.  Is there anything else that should be done while the cover is off?
