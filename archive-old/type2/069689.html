      Jim Heywood &lt;jim.heywood_at_sdrc_dot_com&gt; asks:
&gt;
&gt;What kind of tests do you guys in Calf. have to pass?

Since I kinda started this thread, I'll reply.  I just got smogged on 7/24
and here are the componenets and results of my tests.  Bear in mind that
the criteria for different vehicles/years may be different (can anyone
verify that?), and that I tested with a one-year old catalytic converter
and muffler.  I've also listed the results of my '94 smog test to show the
difference a new catalytic converter and muffler make (no other mods or
major repairs).

The smog tech said I tested out as good as a new car.  As I said earlier,
he said he thought that there *was no way* to check the EGR valve
functioning, and I didn't want to risk telling him how to uncouple the link
to the throttle and operate the valve manually.  [If anybody needs a Bay
Area smog station that's quick, friendly and doesn't know how to check the
EGR valve, I'll be glad to let you know in a private Email].
