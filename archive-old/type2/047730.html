Subject: [T2] Tranny install, etc.

Today was supposed to be THE BIG DAY where I installed the engine AND
tranny into the 69. Well, I got the gas tank pulled and installed for the
third time, looking for the hookup for the fuel gauge (which is apparently
AWOL); engine compartment seal installed; the shift coupler replaced; the
inner CVs cleaned, lubed (eeeeewwww!), and new boots and screws installed;
and the tranny installed. I'm missing the set screw for the shift coupler
to the tranny and a couple of the bolts for the mount, but I had a couple
of 17mm bolts and nuts that are on there now. The tranny's currently
supported at the rear by a pyramid of a half-dozen foot-long 4x4s.

Installing the tranny solo was a real challenge, balancing it on a piece of
plywood on my floor jack and propping it up with a system of the 4x4s
(thanks, Don!). I've gotta recruit some muscle for the engine installation.
Or at least Dear Old Dad the retired aerospace engineer -- he'll be able to
rig something a little more secure than the floor jack system.

I'm sooo close! :-) I worked five hours on this today, ate dinner, and
collapsed in front of the TV for a couple of hours. Whew!
