Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Pedal = Stalled Engine

&gt; I hooked up my brake servo line to the part in my Weber single (dual
barrel)
&gt; and the brake servo now kicks in great, but stalls the engine?

I'm having the same problem on a 73 with a weber progressive I installed.  I
haven't taken the time to research it but ill let you know if I find a
solution.  Hopefully someone else on the list has heard of this before.

Lee
