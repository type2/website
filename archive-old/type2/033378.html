Subject: Sun Ra Arkestra in ark

I was just asked a question about having  a nine-seater the other day, and
I realized I can't remember if I posted a message about this or not, so
pardon the band-width if I did.....

I recently had the honor of USING  those nine seats to haul around 7
members of the Sun Ra Arkestra and their equipment!! For most, this will
mean nothing, but for the jazzbos out there - well, this makes a dozen jazz
musicians I have dragged around Texas, but they don't get any cooler than
the Arkestra!  After the show, some of us retired to a restaurant and told
stories well into the night. Bliss.

Amusingly, the OTHER 3 guys had to ride in - a 1973 Westy!!  By sheer
coincidence, both drivers had VWs.  We laughed and apologized that we
weren't big modern minivans (some members of the Arkestra are in their 70s,
and looked  a little cramped :)  ), but THEY laughed and said &quot;you don't
know the Arkestra! Man, we've gone to gigs on the back of flatbeds - in
fact, one of our gigs WAS a flatbed, driven thru Cairo!&quot;
