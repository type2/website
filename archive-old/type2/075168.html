Subject: Re: [T2] Slight Back Fire/Another Dizzy Question

[...]


&gt; I rebuilt a Bosch 205A for my 72 bus

A 205A??   What did that one fit?  The correct one is a 021 905 205E

&gt; out of two I had, new points gaped at
&gt; .016, cap and rotor, used a condenser that was on one because I could not
&gt; find one to match up locally, I have a 32/36 DFAV and installed the advance
&gt; vacume &quot;front of can&quot; to a vacume port on the rear &quot;facing me&quot; of the carb,
&gt; for the retard side I teed off the carb manifold that supply's the Vacume
&gt; Brake Assist, installed and static timed it and went to fire it up, Ye Ha it
&gt; started right up, then I timed it to 7.5 BTDC

Whoa!   WAY TOO MUCH initial timing at idle. If you have vacuum at idle to the
retard side, the correct timing at idle is 5 AFTER. If you disconnect the retard
vauum, it should go to 5 to 10 BEFORE.

&gt;and 32 Advance ATDC,

No..... you cannot have 32 degrees Advance and have it go ATDC. No way, no how.
When you ADVANCE timing you are leading the spark BEFORE top dead center.


&gt;however
&gt; when I slowly give it gas I get a slight hesitation and some slight back
&gt; fire, but once it revs up it seams to run fine as I check my advance timing,

IF you have manifold vacuum at idle going to the retard side and intial timing
set at 5 AFTER [NOT static timing] then as soon as you open the throttle,
manifold vacuum will drop and you will get an instant 11 to 15 degrees of
advance.
As soon as you hit about 2000 rpms, you get 13 - 16 degrees centrifugal advance
and 8 - 12 degrees vacuum advance if you reached 8'' of vacuum on the advance
side.
Do you have ported vacuum going to the advance side? [the nipple pointing away
from the dist.]
Ported vacuum is no vacuum at idle and it appears after you open the throttle.
Set your timing at 5 after AT IDLE. Then disconnect the retard hose.Read the
timing now. Should be around 8 before. Bring the engine speed up to around 3600
and read the timing. It should be around 35 to 38 degrees + the initial of 8 so
it should be off the scale. The scale ends at 40, correct?
Forget that 'max total advance of 30-32', this is NOT a type1 engine. It is a
type4, it is designed to run with this much timing.
Go to the 68-79 Bentley, section 5, page 75 and look up the correct distributor
and do the math.


&gt; I'm sorta afraid to take it on the road while it is doing this for a test
&gt; drive, can any see something I missed or can offer suggestions on what to
&gt; try.
