Subject: Brake Questions: Bus pulls down in front.

Hey Volks,
     Thanks to all those who replied about partly camperizing my bus.  I got 
some really great info.  Some of the replies saved me some time trying 
different things, and some money in buying things to try that I would most 
likely not be satisfied with.  Anyway, on to the question:
     I was having some brake trouble last week.  When I hit the brakes it 
felt like there was no brake booster, like I was doing all the work myself.  
Now, I have nothing to compare the brake feeling with since I have never 
driven another bus, but it seemed not right to me.  I went under the bus and 
replaced the little plastic or hard rubber piece that goes form the metal 
vacuum tube to the brake booster, it looked rough.  For this I used a high 
quality rubber line from the FLAPS, is that cool?  This did nothing for or 
against me at all.
     I adjusted the rear brakes according to Bentley, checked the shoes and 
the pads up front, and took it for another spin.  This time things seemed a 
bit improved.  I still would not exactly feel comfortable in a panic stop 
(might have to dry off the seat afterwards in fact), but things are better.  
The only weird thing is that the bus now seems to pull (or push, or just go) 
down in the front when I hit the brakes.  Any ideas why that might happen?  
I am planning to bleed the lines (possibly replace the fluid if I feel 
froggy) tomorrow or this weekend assuming I can get a helper.  Any thing 
else I can check (yes, I checked the fluid level first thing)?  I want to 
check the brake booster, but I don't have a vacuum gauge (I know, I've got 
to get one).
     How well do these big suckers stop?  Should I have to leave a fair 
amount of extra space and plan my red light stopping well in advance?  I am 
not opposed to this, just would like to know.

Jay

P.S. looking for:
The two front plastic lenses, on either side of the front air vent
The two plastic lenses on the left and right side, tword the rear of the bus 
(The little ones on the side, not the brake and reverse light deals)
Need the screws for the above, with the above.
