Subject: Gas tank

Here's a tidbit only the true type 2 geek will enjoy:
Took the panel that seperates the engine compartment from the gas tank in my 
70 westy off last night, and was absolutely amazed at the condition of the 
gas tank. Folks, this thing looks like the day it rolled off the assembly 
line. Paint inside the compartment was pristine as well (the bus, she must 
have been beautiful in her youth). The little line connecting the tank vent 
was PERFECT. As was the hose from the filler neck. Amazing

I felt like the archeologist that found King Tut's tomb--needless to say, no 
one in my household shared my enthusiasm.
