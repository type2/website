Hello Everyone I have a few qusetions i hope someone can help me with.

1. I have a 71 bus and it has three vents in the passenger area that can be
opened. Unfortunately thay have rusted and i can't get them to close. Does
anyone know how to get these out and where i might be able to get a replacement?

2. I have a super beetle also and the front end vibrates. My question is if
the spindles are worn could this be the problem. How would i check them. If
anyone knows anything about this your help will be greatly appreciated since
i also need to check my buses front end and i'm about ready to park the
thing if i can't find the problem.

Thanx alot
