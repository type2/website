Subject: Re: [T2] Storybook busses at auction

Oly,

Sure would like to hear about it after the fact.

Looks like a *lot* of dust?...dirt on everything...which seems odd for
a &quot;colectors&quot; auction.

Don't forget the line at the bottom where you will add 5% payment to
the auctioneer for the &quot;buyer's fee&quot;.  Hrumph.

Seems weird that the seller is not paying the auctioneer.

Cheers, dave

&gt;  I haven't been up to see these busses, the inspection 
&gt; starts the morning of the auction, I do intend to go 
&gt; just to watch.
&gt; I begged the wife but cannot convince her of the 
&gt; investment value on these and other items that are 
&gt; available.  Check this web site.

&gt; Conrad is about an hour north of Great Falls Montana and 
&gt; the auction is another 20-30 mins from there.
&gt; Let me know if anyone is gonna make the trip, I'd like 
&gt; to get together and BS.
