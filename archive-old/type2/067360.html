&gt;Just visiting a local Bradlees I finally found the VW set of 
&gt;Micromachines.  The set includes:A Bug, Bug convertible, Karmen Ghia,
Rabbit convertible, and a split screen bus.  I'm not sure of the year (im a
Vanagon guy;)) But it has a 
&gt;sunroof and the corner rear windows (23 windows?)
&gt;Just thought someone would want to know...

am i talking to Paul or Robert?

I'll admit to being SAD . i've often wondered if i could get a micromachine
splitty. (sounds like a pre 63 samba)

Paul could you let me know &quot;part numbers&quot; or anything so i can order a set
from Santa!!

Glynn    - sorry you serious bussers out there!

Doe anybody else have any confessions to being SAD?
