&gt; I think I am going to give up on the louvered windows in my '77 Westy and go to sliders, too noisy, too much work to make them work really good.

hehehe.. you're like me.  I hate those things.  They leak a ton of air 
into the back and rattle like crazy.  Keep your eyes open for some 
sliders and they'll definitely pop up.  I do know of a guy in riverside, 
CA that probably has a pair, but that's quite a distance from you.  If 
you decide you want to get some from him, let me know.
