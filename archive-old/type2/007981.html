I'm a list newbie, and per protocol looked for some past discussion in the
Archive on this subject, but I got the impression there was no clear
consensus, so I would like to throw the question up again.

I am the new owner of a '75 Riviera with an 1800 cc &quot;pancake&quot; engine (split
carb type, I believe although danged if I can tell which part(s) are
actually the carburetor!) with 170K on the original engine.

I have been using a lead-substitute additive since purchase in August.  The
mechanic who has worked on this vehicle for the past seven years (Quentin's
Autowerks - Lynnwood, WA), assured me that this was perfectly okay to do.
From reading the archive posts, however, I'm beginning to question the
necessity for this.

So, my question is:  Am I doing anything to either help or hurt my engine by
using this additive?  If it really makes no difference, would I be better
off continuing this practice, or am I just wasting $6 every three months?
