&gt; Hooray for keen and especially hooray for the excellent folks at ISP
&gt; ATLASTA.NET, who have bent over backwards for us once again. Try to find a
&gt; co-loc where the staff will drive out to the NOC multiple times to look at
&gt; your outage, and scrounge up a power supply to keep you running while you
&gt; get a new one; service like this is simply unheard of in the co-location
&gt; business. If you need a hosting provider you could not do better than these
&gt; guys.

&gt; I was cleaning up some of the vast graveyard of used Mac bits and carcasses
&gt; here, which means I was coming across some VW stuff, because it's all mixed
&gt; up together. This is logical if you are me. =^ )

&gt; Free to a good home, one clear glass early Bay reverse light by Hella,
&gt; uncracked, slight haze inside, also one stainless bezel. You can't sell it
&gt; or stash it, you have to put it on your bus. Pmail only, if you reply to the
&gt; list you aren't getting it.
