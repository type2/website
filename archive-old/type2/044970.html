Subject: [T2] steering box question...

hi all,

I have a 71 bus and i think the steering box needs attention.

I have access to a free box from a 77, and those are stronger anyway.

Does anyone know if it will fit? i dont care if i have to modify a bit,
just can i make it work is the question...

thanks,

Steve
