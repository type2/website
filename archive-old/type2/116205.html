&gt; The fuel gauge shows full when you fill up, then works it's way down to

&gt; Question is is it the sender causing the problem, sticking or 
&gt; something, or
&gt; could it be the actual gauge?

It's probably the sender.  This is precisely the problem I had when my 
sender whent bad (except it failed to &quot;empty&quot; when the tank was 3/4 
full :-)

I had my sender replaced when I had the engine out for rebuild, and it 
now works like a champ.
