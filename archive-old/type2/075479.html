Thank you. I didn't know painted baywindow dashboards were that 
rare in the US. 

And:
&gt;Hmmm.  You want to trade a metal dash with an enlarged radio hole
&gt;(it may be done carefully, but it is still not original) for a
&gt;pristine original plastic dash?

The person who'd trade would not be into utter originality I 
think, as truly original to that Bus would be that plastic dash.
The kind of person that would want a different looking dash, or 
just to be able to color match it to the exterior of the car, 
could also be the person installing a modern day car radio I think, 
just like me, and like how my single cab would be less original 
with the plastic dash in it. 

And:
&gt;I'd say that uncracked plastic dashes of that vintage make hens' teeth
&gt;look plentiful!  Perhaps in a museum, but not in a real-world bus!  Also,
&gt;I don't think any buses came to the US with fewer than three holes in
&gt;them (light switch, wipers, hazards) and probably two or three more
&gt;(interior light, defroster, silver socket).

Thanks for the information,
