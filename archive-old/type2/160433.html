Subject: Re: Squeek-squeek on front disk

Consider multiple causation, Mike, and don't overlook the brake pad 
stabilizing spring clip.  My 76 Westy had a front wheel that squeaked and 
rumbled and I found several things to correct. The clip that stabilizes the 
front pads was cracked (almost invisible crack) and barely functional. 
Replaced the clip and squeak stopped but the rumble  continued. I inspected 
the front wheel bearing and found it to have an eroded and pitting race, so 
I replaced that also. Now the front wheels are much quieter. Incidentally, 
I replaced the brake pad spring clip on the other side also, because it was 
cracked....but not making noise.

See these clips at     http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=13020

(relatively new), no recollection of damage to that wheel.  Goes away
upon light touch to brakes, may stay away, then come back.   If I get
this turned, is it done with all on the bus, or must rotor be taken off?
