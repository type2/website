Subject: No EGR = Dropped Valve Seats
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.95q.990614100528.16002A-100000_at_unicorn.it.wsu_dot_edu&gt;

Searching the archives for info about the state of not having an EGR I
found a comment by some person whose name I don't recall. It went
something like &quot;all these people with no EGR's wonder why they keep
dropping valve seats&quot;--is this a rational statement?  does it apply to me?
I have a '79 Kombi without EGR.  I disconnected thethe bar from the
throtle control arm to the EGR portion of the air intake manifold thingy.
Have I done enough--someone mentioned making gaskets for something?
Without my EGR how long will my new AVP cylinder head last? Do I need to
worry?

TIA
