Subject: Re-blowing air up gas line line

Last year I had a rust silt problem (lots of hesitation at full
throttle)-filter was plugged up, rust came out of the line when flushed
into a pail, then it ran clear.  New filter, ran fine.  Later (8 mo) I
changed my clutch and decided to
blow air up the (empty) gas tank line on my 78 as gas was run out, and
could hear the inlet screen happily tonking across the bottom of the
tank!  Presumably rust may have been sitting on the screen and resisted
the air flow. Still running ok but I'm watching the fuel filter- why
can't these be trqansparent??
