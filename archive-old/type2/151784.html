Subject: Re: [T2] Engine missing on 1st cylinder.

Gary,

Change a known good firing wire and plug with the suspect one.

In other words, pull #2 plug and wire and put it in #1.  
#1 plug and wire in #2.

Start bus and see if the problem follows the wire and plug or stays with 
#1.

Just because you get spark on the grounded visible plug doesn't mean that 
you will get it under the compression inside the cylinder.  You could have 
a &quot;weak&quot; plug wire.  Read Bentley about how to check/test plug wires.
You may have a bad spark plug connector.

I've seen them break internally and leave me with a great idle, but no 
power under load....and i intially broke while driving down the hiway at 
70mph.

You may have a rotor or distributor cap problem with #1 while the others 
are ok.

If your #1 plug was &quot;wet&quot; with gas you should be able to get it to fire
if all the electical stuff works well.

The &quot;surge&quot; you are feeling is an almost certain sign of a plug 
wire/rotor/distributor electrical problem.


Cheers, dave

&gt; home, and it was still running rough, I pulled the plug wires one at 
a 
&gt; time with the engine on.  This is what I found.
&gt; 
&gt; Cylinders 2-3-4: Pulled each wire and put it back on.  The engine ran 
&gt; even rougher with each wire off and the engine would die.
&gt; 
&gt; Cylinder 1:  Pulled the plug wire... and nothing changed.  I put an 
&gt; extra plug into the wire and grounded the plug.   I had lots of spark.  
&gt; I pulled the plug and replaced it with the one I tested then started up 
&gt; the bus and pulled the wire.  Nothing, no change in how the engine was 
&gt; running.
&gt; 
&gt; The plug I pulled was wet, smelled of oil and gas.
&gt; 
 I'm not sure what to check next.  When driving I will occasionally get 
 a surge of power for a few blocks as if the everything is fine, then 
 I'm back to the feeling of running on 3 cylinders.  Since I checked 
 spark, I'm not sure what to check next.
