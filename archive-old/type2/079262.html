Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator functioning?


I agree, thats what I did breaking in my new motor with the addition of oil
and filter changes after the first 20 minutes, 100 and 500 miles. Keeping
the sustained speeds below 55 for the first 1000 is next to impossible
though unless you don't mind getting run off the road...

    I think a larger issue here is the &quot;Key&quot; statement, &quot;I'm not ready to
rev the engine up yet&quot;. Point being, you &quot;DONT&quot; want to let a new engine
idle at all. keep the RPM's - 1500 - 2000 for at least the first ten
minuets
or so. The cam lobes and lifter heads, as well as the pistons and
cylinders,
depend on oil sling for lubrication. Don't want to let it idle!
    Keep the oil flying and the air cooling! I usually take a rubber band
and block the choke cam all the way on fast idle for ten or fifteen
minuets.
After this run in you can check for any leaks oil or otherwise, let it cool
down and recheck the valve adjustment, before the road test. On the road
test be sure and don't &quot;lug&quot; the engine. No sustained high speeds either,
keep it in the lower gears, and the RPM's up, for the first few thousand
miles.
    Don't forget to change the oil and adjust the valves at the first 600
miles. Regular maintenance after that.

&gt; Larry:
&gt;
&gt; The light should go out.  Did you remember to attach the wire on the
alternator that goes to the dash light?  Also, some alternators need to
have
a wire attached from the body of the alternator to the Bus chassis.
Another
thing to look at is the belt.  If it's too loose, it may not spin the
alternator fast enough at low RPM.

to behave
