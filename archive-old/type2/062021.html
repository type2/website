I will happily buy one.  Where did you find this item?
I'm imagining mounting it on the rear of the car with a
dash switch to turn it on.  Should help tailgating and
fast overtaking, no?

My dad had two cars, a '63 camper bus and a '60 Chrysler
(BIG fins).  The Chrysler also had push button drive, as
you may recall.  Dad found that the slightest touch on
the reverse button and the backup lights would come on.
His method, then, of shucking tailgaters would be to 
turn on the backup lights at, say, 60mph.  It really 
worked...
