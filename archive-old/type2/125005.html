Subject: accelerator pedal

I'm having a bit of a struggle with my accelerator pedal/cable on my 72.  Is
there supposed to be a spring underneath the pedal?  For some reason, after I
step on the gas, the pedal only comes up about 3/4 of the way.  The only thing
I can think is that there is supposed to be some type of spring under there.
Any suggestions?

Paul
