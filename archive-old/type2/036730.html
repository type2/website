Subject: head install revisted-very frustrated

good morning list,
an update on the head install on my 73 bus.   1800 cc
engine, replaced passenger side head with AVP
purchased head.   installed, valves adjusted(twice
now), timing set, and it runs probably 80-85% power.  
feels pretty good going 1st through 3rd gear, in 4th
when you get up around 50-60 it starts to lose a bit
of power and it is a struggle to keep it there, almost
seems to spit a little bit, then when you let off the
gas about 1 in 3 times it will let out 1 backfire. 
seems to be almost starving at higher rpms, but not
sure if it sounds carb related or something to do with
my head install?   im at wits end...almost, so any
help would be appreciated.

thanks,
shelby

ailment)
