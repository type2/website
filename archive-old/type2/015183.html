Thanks for the information below.  I have called the dealer back, but their
information is a lot more limited on this &quot;old stuff&quot; since they ditched
the microfiche! They can't even find a good part # on 70 amp alternator OR
the boot.  These boots were installed in all later model buses in Canada as
they all came with the BA6 gas heaters.  I've called several dealers up
there hoping to find one on the shelp but, to no avail.  Same in Australia
and South Africa. May just be SOOL on this deal, sorry for the false hope!

Back to searching,
Craig
&gt;*************************************
&gt;To Clarify the listing application:
&gt;
&gt;When I originally created, compiled the data and published the original Bus
&gt;Boys catalog in 1994-95, I specifically showed the the two Elbow boots:
&gt;
&gt;021-903-655D	AL75X Alternator (55amp model)
&gt;
&gt;022-903-655U	AL108X Alternator (70amp model)
&gt;
&gt;The &quot;U&quot; indicated it was a used part, as it was discontinued and they were
&gt;only available used, even way back then.  The actual part number for the
&gt;70amp Elbow boot is 022-903-655 (without the &quot;U&quot;).
&gt;
&gt;Frankly, I think was stupidity on Volkswagen's part (what else is new?) to
&gt;discontinue the 70amp boot.  I believe more Buses in that time frame were
&gt;equipped with this Alternator (75-79) as opposed to the 72-74 55 amp model
&gt;(not counting the 71-74 411/412's of course).
&gt;
&gt;Just a little info......:)
