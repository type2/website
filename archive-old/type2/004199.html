Subject: contact info for Steve's Lock Shoppe
Date: Tue, 8 Aug 2000 22:40:05 -0500

I noticed a request for contact information for those needing my services,
so I thought I'd post it, and at the same time thank list members for
allowing me the opportunity to work with their lock and key requirements.
Steve's Lock Shoppe

(936)435-1324
I just work out of my home, so email is really the best way to get me.  I
will be at Busses Nowhere Near the Arch over labor day, and will have a shop
set up.  You can find me with the Houston bunch, in a Brown Vanagon Westy.
I'll be able to do on site work at that time.  I'm also at most of the Texas
shows.  Again, thanks for the glowing comments and the opportunities.
Steve Sandlin
