Subject: Tire Loading / misleading ratings?

Terry, It all IS quite confusing if one studies it...
The reason we &quot;need&quot; the higher rating tires is for
the &quot;stronger sidewalls&quot; due to the rear engine and
the phenomenon best described as cantilevering load -
meaning that with our engines hanging out the back,
when we take hard corners or dips, the load on the
sidewalls of the tires increases to the point where
standard passenger car tire sidewalls simply won't
take the load. We all know that.

Now you bring up an interesting note. A P-metric tire
is a standard passenger car tire with a standard
passenger tire sidewall rating. Extra load P-metric
tires have an XL designation after the size.

Here's where it gets confusing: Your standard P-metric
tires have a load rating of 1678 lbs per tire at what
pressure? I assume 35psi. My load range &quot;C&quot; 6-ply
rating tires have a load rating of 1435 lbs per tire
at 50psi (both the BF Goodrich and the Coopers - both
are light truck tires)

So what, exactly are we looking for again? The max
load rating of your tires is higher than the max load
rating of load range &quot;C&quot; tires yet they are standard
passenger car tires - the difference of course is that
yours are 225 width.

Now my bus is 3800 pounds in camping form with me in
it. Checking each axle individually, I got 1900 on the
button for each axle. Theoretically, that is 950 per
tire. At 1435 load rating per tire, that's a 485
safety zone. If I remember correctly, the reinforced
sidewall Nokians are rated 1600+ lbs per tire, also
higher than the LT 195/75 R14 LRC tires.

This all would lead a person to &quot;assume&quot; that if the
tire load rating in pounds is higher than a LRC tire
AND all 4 tires were matched so they all have the same
flexing characteristics, that he would be better off
with the higher per-tire load rating in pounds.

Why again are we supposed to use 6-ply rated tires?
If your tires are rated for a higher than 1435 pound
load, doesn't that also mean that the sidewalls of
your tires can withstand a higher load than the 6-ply
rated or LRC tires?  - BaH

&gt; 
&gt; Not sure of the load rating but on the sidewall it
&gt; sez--1678 lbs  per
&gt; tire---
&gt; 
&gt; It's a real good wet / Winter tire--
&gt; 
&gt; I got them at Discount Tire.

&gt; Hakkapaleta is the model of the correct load rated
&gt; Nokian.
