Subject: RE: Back to my battery and starting

&quot;Is your Westy an automatic or manual-trans model??&quot;

It's a manual.

&quot;is carried in a brass bushing&quot;

I'm going to have to check that.

&quot;your BMW battery seems to do a better job&quot;

Yes, it starts the motor.

&quot;it may be that the brushes are nearly worn out&quot;

Based on a receipt found in the bus when I got it - the starter is only 3
years old - that is if they put in a new or quality rebuilt starter.

Many thanks for the help, especially the bushing lead!  Unfortunately, I
don't have a heated work space, so checking the bushing might wait 'til
spring.

Regards,

Wayne
