Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder Head Paint

That's a good point Barry. The referenced literature also discusses
the importance of cleanliness as dirt, grease, and rust all act as
insulators.

 Man, if you have a rich pitina of rust on the cylinder heads, all you have
 to so is spray the cylinder heads (outsides, fin area) with phosphoric acid.

 And remember to wash the phosphoric acid spray off the cylinders right after
 you have waited an appropriate 10-15 minutes.  Blow dry, or let the sun do
 the work.  Look at the results 1 hour later.  Now, aren't you satisfied with
 yourself.
