I had so much trouble with MSHP that I have given up on them. I had to wait
6 months for an engine deposit. I have had some trouble with the rebuild I
purchased and have had nothing but trouble with there &quot;waranty policy&quot;. I
have said it before - I think MSHP makes a decent product but once they have
your money the customer service goes out the window.
