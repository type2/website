Subject: Re: [T2] CHT Gauge Accuracy

on 7/1/04 14:50, Dave C. Bolen related:

&gt; Tim,
&gt; 
&gt; What kind of oil temps when you see 475-500???

&gt; Pull the #3 plug, and test the cht sender in a pot of boiling water...or
&gt; the oven, or both....ovens have been known to be off quite a bit...try a
&gt; digital turkey type thermometer at the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave

i agree with these thoughts, especially about checking oil temperature. i
recommend have the air-fuel mixture verified, the l-jet system is a
lean-burn design and if it leans out any more than normal, head temps will
rise quickly.  

for checking the CHT gauge,  think it is good also to clamp the sender to a
mass of metal, like a piece of steel or aluminum, before immersing it.

we've seen some quality control issues with the CHT gauges. the latest
problem is that we have 3 gauges come back to us with the sender wires
installed into the harness backwards, so the gauge will only work if you
have the red harness wire on the - terminal and the black on the +.
