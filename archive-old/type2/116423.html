Subject: Re: '70 Westy color code (off white)?

DOH!

The color code was the easy part (L87 Pearl White).  It was the 
UPHOLSTERY code which I couldn't identify for sure.  I was trying to 
order upholstery for the front seats, and the choices out there seemed 
to be either 'tan' or 'beige'.  I ordered the tan from Wolfsburg West, 
but they're too dark.  I guess I'll order the beige now, just to see 
which is closer.

Anyone else have any luck matching the original front seats in an early 
bay Westy?
