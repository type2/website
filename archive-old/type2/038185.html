Subject: Tranny Removal

This is in my '72 with a '72 Transmission and a '78 engine.  I am now
putting in a '78 Transmission.

We got in a debate trying to determine if we actually have to remove the
engine to swap out the Transmission.  All the books tell you to remove the
engine, but from the outside it looks like maybe possible to do it without
having to deal with engine.  (call me either lazy or optimistic - but I've
taken that engine out too many times already)

Any thoughts??
