Subject: Delta Coat applying tip

I emailed the vendor and asked if it could be dabbed on.  He replyed to me
&quot;...if you have a lot of patience, it can be slowly brushed.&quot;  And then
refered back to his site.

So, while it's true that  &quot;..Any of you guys considering the Delta Coat
stuff, be aware that he is not talking about a regular airless paint
sprayer.  He's talking about specialized equipment designed to spray heavy
coatings.&quot;  it looks like it could be stipple brushed on.  No worse than
Kool Patch, I would imagine.  Anyone out there with experience with them
both care to comment?
