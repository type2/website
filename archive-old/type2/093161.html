Subject: Re: [T2] Just a Couple of Questions

Mine doesn't work - if it did it wouldn't for long... buzzers drive me 
nuts!!! &lt;grin!&gt;

There are several circuits that are live on the fuse panel. The lights are 
a good example.

If you take power off the permanently hot side of the fuse panel be sure to 
fuse the wire to the stereo.




&gt;In bugs with a seat belt warning buzzer, there is a &quot;key in ignition&quot;
&gt;switch.  This can be used to power a relay for the radio. Or so I've
&gt;heard.  Do some Type2's have this buzzer?
