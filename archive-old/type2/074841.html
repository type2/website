Subject: RE: [T2] Belly pans?

Bob,

Here is the deal with this.

vw number		description			size

N 013 890 5		tapping screw hex hd	ST6.3X13-C
N 010 210 7		screw hex hd		M6X10K
N 011 6665 10	washer			B6.1X18X2

These can probably be had at you local hardware store. You could also try
your local dealer. Yet of course you can get these new or used from us as
you know (www.BUStedBUS_dot_com for those who don't)

&gt; &gt; All of the T2's I have ever seen had them, unless someone forgot to put

&gt; The one you're talking about is the one that goes in the front, under the
&gt; cab area.  That one is indeed supposed to be on every bus.

actually what I need is that blamed screw/bolt whatever that holds the
front on...I can not find a bolt or screw or skyhook that will fit the
hole, had to wire mine up...WHAT size is it???

or maybe my hole is really stripped

&gt;
&gt; Incidentally, that item (211 703 611H, $39.95 in our catalog/website) has
&gt; now been discontinued.  We have perhaps 3 left, genuine VW and with a
little
&gt; bit of surface rust from being at the bottom of the stack, and when
they're
&gt; gone we probably won't see more.  So if you need one, grab one now while
you
&gt; can...
