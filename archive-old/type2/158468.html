&lt;hello Jeremiah  You are better off pulling the engine and you really need
to pull both heads as there will be  junk that will flow from one side &lt;to
the other side.  Later  mark Dearing

just to be sure.  if the vavle seat has dropped can that be remachined  or
do i need new head(s)?


thanks for your patience.
