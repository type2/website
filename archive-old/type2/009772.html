&gt;
&gt;my hunch led me to wonder if iwas sold the right meter. turns out the meter
&gt;i was sold is 0 280 200 018.  but the number specified for my year
&gt;(8/74-12/75) is 012. would the different part cause such hooky-dooky,

There is no way to put a 018 on a bus that uses a 012 or putting a 012 on a 
bus that uses a 018. The plug on a 012 only has 6 pins. 018 has 7. Unplug 
the plug and count your pins. If it is 6, then the AFM you have is a rebuilt 
and they put the wrong cover on it.




or
&gt;should i let it ride, expect the camper to run lean or something, and look
&gt;into another source of the problem?

Check your cylinder head temp sensor by #3 cylinder. Loosen it and retighten 
it.
