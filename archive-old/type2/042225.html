Subject: measure firing pattern on a scope?

I have access to an oscilloscope and have a stable of ACVWs.  Is anyone
aware of a circuit which would couple the signal from each of the spark
plug wires to the scope input so that firing pulses from all four can be
simultaneously displayed?

Seems to me as though this would be an invaluable peek at the stability of
distributor and points and the condition of plug wires.
