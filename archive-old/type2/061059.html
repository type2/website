 Shawn:
 A defective fuel pump might cause loss of power on hills, but it seems
 like symptoms would show up during full throttle cruising as well. The
 push rods on the 72-74 type 4 fuel pumps sometimes wear out causing
 inadequate fuel delivery, too. I'd stick with a stock pump because it's
 low tech and safe,(though rather expensive), but first replace your fuel
 filter, and try to replicate the same symptoms when the gas tank is
 completely full. If it does this with a full tank, I doubt it's a fuel
 delivery problem.

Thanks for your help.  Have you heard of any problems with using a electric
fuel pump.  Also, do you know of any place that carries the old mechanical
pumps?  Thanks again for your help.
