Subject: Body Shops in Northern VA?

So I am wanting to get the Possum a new coat for the spring. I am going to
be replacing the rusty doors with good ones I have aquired from listees.
Rear cargo hatch same deal. I am going to have a buddy who is nice with the
welder replace my dented and rusty right rear corner and right rear wheel
well arch front side. The only other rust is a few small spots of surface
rust which I planned on sandblasting and then sealing. I don't have a
garage to do body work in. Just the shop I used to work at which I can't
leave Possum in over night. I thought I would get the above mentioned stuff
ready, pull all the glass, remove the pop-top, D/A w/80 grit the whole
thing, and have it towed to a shop to finish. Rest of body work, primer,
base coat, clear coat, or maybe Imron. Anybody know of decent shops in
Northern VA? I don't want an 89.95-paint- your- tires-too special, but I am
also not looking to make it a show car either.

I am essentially looking for advice here and maybe you can include your own
experience along with costs$$$?

Thanks as always for the help.
