Subject: Re: [T2] Here's one up in Washington

&gt; Time for another road trip? lol

I sure could use one, but it's not in the charts for me any time soon.
I've taken on about as much as I can handle or use. I have three VW buses
now. I'd like more, but the neighbors would think we've finally flipped our
cookies. LOL.
I'm just now trying to negotiate something to thin the herd a little bit.
I've got an old '70 Ford F250 PU that's been with me for about 14 years.
Trusty old &quot;Betsy&quot;, who only crapped out on me when I needed her most, but
that's all behind us and forgiven now. We've had a lot of fun with her and
gotten a lot of work out of her, too. She's just an old beater truck, good
for a gardener or construction, and I know someone who needs a truck like
that. The problem is, our prospective &quot;buyer&quot; has no money, and nothing I
want to trade for.. at least nothing we've figured out yet. But he's a good
guy who could use a little help right now, and I think he might have a good
small block Chevy engine that we could use.
Heck.. I don't need this truck, I'm not hard up for cash.. I could give it
away.. I need the space more, now. The trucks not worth much on the street,
but it would be a goldmine for him. He needs it to work. I just want to get
something for it... for my dignity, you know. I'd sure rather see someone
who needs it get some use out of it than to give it to a charity and have it
crushed and sent to China.  Jan B
