Subject: Re: carb problems and no idle after warm up

I wrote a couple of days back about my bus not idling after it warmed
up. Somebody else had written something similar a day or so earlier and
there was a post today about something that sounded familiar.  After
much trial and tribulation, rebuilding the carb, replacing fuel line and
filter, checking valves, replacing spark plugs, rotor and dizzy cap,
etc.  It turned out to be the idle cut off switch.  The P.O. had used
some sort of silicon thread sealer to stop a fuel leak at said
electromagnetic switch and some of the stuff had worked its way into the
intake side of the switch and had partially blocked its intake port.  No
idle after warm up. Removed the offending rubber, reinstalled the valve
and it works like a charm.  I hope this helps anyone else with a similar
problem.
