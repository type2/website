Hi,
        It is a 17mm allen head wrench.  When I did it I only had two
bolts, the fill and the drain, no gaskets or washers.  Get a friend to
help.  Buy gear oil, the 17mm wrench, and aquire a bucket to drain
into, a big funnel, and a LONG hose to go from the bottom of the
funnel to the fill hole.  Drive home, drain the transmition for a few
hours.  Clean it up, place newspaper uner the transmition, a thick
stack below the fill hole.  Hook the tube to the funnel and hold it in
the fill hole while your friend poors the gear oil into the funnel.
Keep checking twords the end, until it is full.  Plug it up, and clean
it up.  Do your best not to get too much gear oil on you.  It STINKS
and takes a while to get the smell off you (DAYS!).  

Have fun,
        brandy
