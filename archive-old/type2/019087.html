Since ya'll know how this story ends, I'll just fill you in on what
happened before I hit that deer. ;-)

My trip started at my parents' in Banning. I camped there and visited
them -- my dad's health is starting to fail, and I wanted them to know I
was embarking in my trusty beast in a thoughtful and responsible manner.

The first couple of days were uneventful. I visited a friend in Phoenix,
had my first urban camping experience. Hot bed in a stuffy bus -- leave
the bed unfolded in warm weather from now on. Radiant heat from the
engine is nice for cold weather, I found out, but hell otherwise.

First RV park experience in El Paso. Really nice people there! The
proprietess brought me home-grown tomatoes and fresh-baked bread for my
supper. She's doing her memoirs for her kids, so we talked genealogy.

El Paso was the big score for my family history research. I found
newspaper clippings surrounding my ggrandfather's shooting death, the
death record for my gggrandfather, and discovered that the graves for my
ggrand and his mother are unmarked. I'll remedy that eventually.

Headed on up to Big Spring and camped at a truck stop. Not bad, but
noisy (trucks idling all night) and quite well-lit. As with the RV park,
I was the leettle one down on the end. :-)

Just before Weatherford I crested a small hill, and all of a sudden the
landscape got beautiful! Rolling hills and oaks. I got to Weatherford
that Thursday night and planted myself at a local no-frills RV park.
That Friday I explored Weatherford -- cute little town, very historic!
Fried catfish -- yum, yum! Saturday I hit the library, not much found
but some Civil War rosters where I may be able to look up my
ggggrandfather who supposedly died in that conflict.

Saturday night the weather broke with an awesome thunderstorm! And it
got COLD! After Saturday's 90s, Sunday was in the 50s and muddy for the
Civil War reenactment. That was very exciting, a really big production.
Two little boys were standing in front of me, and one said, &quot;Where's the
catapults?!&quot; Uh, kid...? The other little boy pointed out a rather
corpulent Union soldier with a long white beard and exclaimed, &quot;Santa's
in the fight!!!&quot;

I liked Weatherford so much I stayed an extra night. I hit Dallas rush
hour on Monday, in the rain, low on gas. Thank you David for letting me
park! An empty driveway never looked so good. After 3 nights of rain
Wendelin's leaks really became apparent. I've got a huge task of tearing
out and replacing rotted-out plywood and paneling on that side of the
high-roof.

Tuesday I headed on to Austin to visit with Craig K. and hopefully my
cousin Nancy. Craig's a hoot! He likes skulls -- skulls are cool,
huh-huh, huh-huh. Poor guy was so sick, but he made me feel welcome
nonetheless.

I didn't get to hook up with Nancy or her mother in San Antonio. Her
mother had urgent eye surgery that day. Poor t'ing. There's always next
year....

So I headed on to San Antonio to meet Mike G. and see the Porsche-bus.
Mike and Ginny are just the nicest people! They MADE me stay in their
guest room! Ginny makes the best coffee! Mike let me drive that
beast.... :-D Yes, it's fast. And I hardly put it through its paces.

Then I stopped to have dinner with Art Lynch and Kathy. I'm lucky I
didn't take home about three of those kittens, but my roommate woulda
killed me!

I left there Thursday evening, officially On My Way Home, and a few
hours later I hit that deer. Thanks AGAIN!!! to everybody on The List
who helped me out, wished me well, and got me home. I literally couldn't
have done it without you. As I said before, the support I got here took
what could've been a disaster and elevated it to the realm of adventure.
I made some more friends in Texas I wouldn't have otherwise, and my
faith in humankind has been given a huge boost!

I've already warned my boss I'm going back to Texas next year, and I'm
taking THREE weeks!!! I've got to meet Nancy and her mother, and I
didn't get to have Texas bar-b-q when I was there! That's just a cryin'
shame! There are several Bus Listees I would've liked to have met. I may
not have amassed much genealogical data, but *any* is progress, and I
learned a lot about how to do the research.

My bus rules!!! Living in her for two weeks was just great. Mechanically
she's so sound. I learned much (like how to adjust the valves), refined
a lot, and next time I'm camping more state parks. Texas has many, and
they're really nice! Mineral Wells, for example. Very nice. Next
time....
