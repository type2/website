This is almost certainly what the problem is (it's not the 009, I have a 
proper VW vac advance disy) but the muck is a nightmare to shift. It's imune 
to carb cleaner and any other substance I throw at it.

In the end I have to chose between spending more time poking around in the 
carb or shelling out for a new one and getting back on the road. I've 
decided to go for the later as everyones suggestions indicate that I have 
some crud in there somewhere.

Thanks for your help though. It's going to get me driving quicker than if I 
spent even longer fighting with dirt.

Picture at: 
http://philsworkbench.blogspot_dot_com/2007/06/crud-killed-my-bus.html in case 
anyone wants to see what carb muck looks like.

&gt; The carb was fine when the tank was full of rust. I've not adjusted the

Rust is a big problem for the accel pump.. a tiny.. I mean TINY spec in the
area of the ball will make it not work.
Do you know what the ball is for...?
It is a check valve..  if the valve isn't seating because a TINY speck of
rust is holding it off the seat.. it just pushes the gas back into the float
bowl instead of out thru the pressurized nozzle.


&gt;
&gt; I've looked at the inlet through a magnifier and have removed all the 
&gt; crud.
&gt; The ball moves so I'm not sure what else there is to go wrong - at least 
&gt; not
&gt; this wrong.
