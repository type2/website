Hey everyone!

  Has anyone had any experience with converting a kombi to a panel? My rear side window has a ventwing. The rubber has to be replaced, but the little piece between the glass and the vent wing is almost rusted away at the bottom. I could cut it out and put solid glass in, but then again, maybe I could turn it into a panel?

Peace &amp; Harmony
