The story:

'79 Cali Westy Deluxe, not running tip-top, consistent lifter noise on
pass side, tho' seems to go away after running.  About an hour from home
it REALLY starts having problems so I get it towed.  I get tune up
parts, and set to.

Cold compression test 124-130 in all cylinders except #1, which is at
60.

Pull valve covers and have a looksee.  Nothing flailing.  Adjust #1 to
.006 per Boston Bob.

Re-test #1 cold.  Up to 80.  Squirt oil in the cylinder - up to 125.

Okay, so I need to start shopping for an engine.

But, in the meantime...  Do I...

1)  Adjust the valves per BB at .006 PLUS 1/2 turn on the other 3
cylinders, wait a few weeks and come back and do #1 the xtra 1/2 turn
also?

2)  Adjust all to .006 per BB now and adjust all another 1/2 turn in a
few weeks?

3)  Adjust all or some per Bentley now?

4)  Leave the rest of the valves alone, deal with #1 only.

I'm going to pull all the adjuster screws and replace as needed when I
do the adjusts.  I figure a look at them might help?

I've gotta limp around 'till I can get a handle on a replacement.

Thanks!

Teri
