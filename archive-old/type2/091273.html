Subject: knocking sound from back left wheel.

I just took my 1983 Westy on her first road trip to
yellowstone and teton.  She performed admirably, but
about half way through the trip I started to get a
knocking sound from the back left wheel.  It would
intermittently come and go, get louder and softer,
etc.  When I checked it out, it seemed fine.  I was
able to make it stop for a while by pushing the bar
that goes from the tranny to the wheel back toward the
transmission (transaxle toward the inner CV joint I
beleive) where it felt like it would get some sort of
compression and stay there for a while.  I am
wondering what the problem may be, and if I just need
to be replacing a leaky joint cover or need a more
serious repair.  thanks
