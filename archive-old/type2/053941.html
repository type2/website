Hey there Alex,

I've been interested in this swap for quite a while. This item is on
my want to do list (not need to do list).  Someone from Limbo told me
that the Vanagon GL seats will work also. The tracks are the same.
The GL seats are like the baywindow seats except that the cushion
material is made of foam, not that horsehair stuff. They even went as
far to say that the original seat material on the 79 (same seats as
your 77) will fit on the GL seats. So I'm guessing that the V'gon
westy seats will work too.

The only problem is that if you want to keep the GL seats armrests
you have to cut holes is the 77's fabric so the armrests will attach.
(My 79 has the air vents running down the doors, so I'll only be able
to use the armrest on the walkthru side of the seats).

The seat fabric comes off pretty easy. the seat bottom is attached by
a cardboard rim that is fit into a long slot in the seat bottom. The
tension of the seat springs keep it in place. The back is held on by
a couple of clips, where the seatback meets the bottom.

If I'm wrong on any of this can someone please correct me ! (Karl ??
anyone ??) 

I haven't searched the archives, but the answer is probably in there 
too. If this is correct, then this would be an excellent swap.
Upgraded seating, with original (OG, for vintage list members) seat
material. 

Hope this helps,
