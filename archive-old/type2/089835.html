&lt;&lt; Bigger tax write off?

&gt;i have seen bilboards here in tulsa, ok for people to donate cars, boats
&gt;and other things to charities. i never looked into where they go, though.
&gt;now i have to wonder! then again, if they are scrapping them, then why do
&gt;they need to be running? i dont know if it matters if it runs, here.

One of the local charities here runs the same scheme...They accept almost
everything from houses to shoes and give a blank tax form in exchange. It's
up to the doner to fill out and submit it to the IRS. I've seen a couple three
dicey cars on their &quot;lot&quot;...Saabs, Volvos, etc. all &quot;running&quot; but with serious
problems. My guess is, if you're in the kinda tax bracket that buys these
things new, it's worth it to take the deduction rather than get a low-ball
price on a sale. A scrapyard takes the real clunkers, tho' but a corner
used car lot gets the &quot;maybes&quot;...
