Subject: source of mysterious engine noise discovere

No thanks to any help from the list :) I've found the source of the &quot;tap,
tap, tapping&quot; from my engine that was driving me freakin' crazy. Being the
helpful guy I am, I thought I would share.

Rocker arms. Yes, rocker arms. Worn out of spec, my rocker arms were
allowing too much movement, which allowed them to gall one of my new rocker
arm shafts, which made the whole situtation worse. I found a set of
acceptable used rocker arms, bought a new rocker arm, and now things are
quiet. Next on the extinguish engine noises list: those g**damn exhaust slip
joints that absolutely refuse to seal.

Slowly but surely, my engine is getting quieter.

There. Now go check your rocker arms. There is a spec for them published in
the Bentley Manual. If they are worn out, and they probably are because
everyone reuses them endlessly, find a better set. You'll have a quieter
engine and more accurate valve clearances.
Bob
