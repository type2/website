Craig,

Just for fun....

Berg says internal clearancing for rods should be xx? amount?
I can't remember, but i think it was something like 60 thou so that
at speed and heat, they would still have clearance from the case.

I know how much you must have assembled and disassembled, but could it 
possibly be a piston put in backwards????....don't ask how i know&lt;grin&gt;.

What about the clearance between the cam lobes/lifters and the case.

Pull the spark plug wires on that side while running and see if
the noise goes away....stress/pressure related?

Pull the plugs on that side and see if you can get it to run...but just 
for a little while as rings don't do well with no compression against 
them.  Does it still sound the same?

In other words, is it a noise caused by the stress of combustion on that 
side or strictly a &quot;movement&quot; of the engine kind of thing.

Cheers, dave
