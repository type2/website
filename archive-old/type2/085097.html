Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Body restoration Tech and Tips Web Site?

- I don't think it is as strong as a weld or 3M wouldn't recommend it for
non-structural uses only. You simply cannot butt weld with it.
- Maybe no welding skills are required but a whole different set of skills
is.
- With real welding you don't need several hours for your &quot;weld&quot; to set up.
You can tack something and in a few seconds it is as strong as it's ever
going to be.
- The material cost involved in a real welded repair is still cheaper. This
is particularly true for an amateur or hobbyist.

I'm sure body panel adhesive has it uses but it doesn't replace welding.


&gt; Did you Know-----
&gt; 
&gt; That 3-M has a body panel adhesive that is as strong as, if 
&gt; not stronger than a weld, and the compoud it is made out of 
&gt; displaces moisture, to prevent any rust in tha area repaired?
&gt; 
&gt; Good stuff, no warpage, no burning through the surrounding 
&gt; sheet metal, easy to work with, no welding skills required--------
&gt; 
&gt; Wam, Bam, thank you Mam----
