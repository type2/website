Subject: Starters, WR-1 hot start kit and bled-down hydraulic lifter?

All Cognizant and Powerful List:

Wow!  A metric-mess load of starter and hydraulic lifter troubles!  With
all that bad busma floating around, it caught up with me as well over
the weekend...

If you do choose to run the WR-1 kit (and I like them very much), route
your wiring VERY carefully!  Don't AMHIK 'zactly how quickly an idling
2260 Type 4 motor with a 228mm clutch can grind, nay, OBLITERATE  the
little pinion gear off an SR-17X starter.  It turns out that the relay
trigger lead had come to rest over top of the miscellaneous leads on the
big lug on the starter, thusly switching the relay and deploying the
starter gear into a hot LZ...  It wasn't pretty :-(  The whole mess is
now secured way above the lug and given a double wrap of split-loom
tubing, secured with tie-wraps.

I'm also with the good doctor on keeping things clean in the battery
department, and will also get up on my soapbox and tell everyone to
consider just how long the electrical part of their ignition switch has
been use.  Volks, if it's been in there since Slippery D*ck, Jerry,
Jimmy or Ron was the Prez, you really should give some thought to
retiring that bad boy.  I just replaced the one on the wife's '69 Ghia,
and know for a fact that the '68-'70 models (whatever they are) all use
the same switch, and that a new part is not an absolute guarantee of
perfection either.  I tend to replace the switches on any new-to-me
VeeWee to establish a baseline, and install the the WR-1 kit at the same
time.  My '72 Weekender got a new switch portion but it was funky right
out of the box, tending to occaisionally not throw a full contact on
warm days.  I replaced it with another one (trouble-free from the start)
once it got to the point where it was pretty much not making contact
regularly on warm days, and taking two or three tries to get it right.
There's lots of places that need to be checked out, contact-wise, and
once you are satisfied everything is up to snuff, feel free to add the
WR-1 as an enhancement to a tip-top ignition system...

There's also one other area that I have stumbled across that those with
earlier Type 4 powered bus models will want to consider updating to
later model parts.  The heater flapper valve vents the bleed air out
through a &quot;reverse bell&quot;, mushroom shaped thingie that directs the hot
air 360 degrees.  On the right-hand heater box, this will vent the hot
air onto the solenoid, with all the heat soak, fun and frolic that
ensues...  The fun and frolic manifests itself when you stop for fuel on
a road trip, and your previously &quot;reliable&quot; start up procedure goes
bye-bye, when you twist the key.  Just driving around town is usually
not enough to &quot;hot soak&quot; the solenoid, it needs a few hours to manifest
itself, as in about as many hours into a road trip to stop for an empty
tank.  The later model Type 4 powered buses use a modified heater
flapper valve that vents the bleed air DOWN and AWAY from the
starter/solenoid - take your cues from the factory!  See your friendly
local bone-yard for replacements, and I &quot;think&quot; the same modified ones
were used on the air-cooled Vanagons too...  In the interim, you may
wish to do as I have done on some other T4 powered vehicles I've owned
and simply pop rivet a piece of tin can onto the offending  mushroom so
as to prevent the bleed air from being blown directly onto the solenoid.

And lastly, since I had to drive the '73 Deluxe to the VW FLAPS to get
my new SR-17X, the bled-off lifter its been suffering with finally
filled up as I left the shop.  I had done the let it fast idle thing,
done the short hop thing, all to no avail.  It did indeed take about 20
minutes of driving, finally going &quot;sewing machine&quot; quiet as I left the
shop and rounded the first corner to head home.

Life is good!
