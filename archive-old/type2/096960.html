Subject: Re:  No Headlights in my 82 Westy!

&quot;I'm hoping y'all can help me out so I can drive the Westy at night.
Monday night I went out to drive her and my headlights wouldn't come on.
All of the front, side, and rear lights work, just no headlights.  When I
activate the dimmer switch, the brights come on and I hear the relays
clicking in the fuse box but the lights go back off when I release the
dimmer switch.  Also, the windshield wipers don't work unless I hold the
dimmer switch in at a certain spot.
What I have done so far:  I have checked the fuses and everything is good.
I have tried a different light switch (on the dash), dimmer switch, and
wiper switch.  None of these did any good.  Does anyone have any other
suggestions?  In case you didn't notice the title, my Westy is an 82
air-cooled. &quot;

		it's the head light switch. get a new one and eventually
you want to get relays to switch the lights and the headlight switch
triggers the relays.
