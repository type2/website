Volks:

You may have noticed that I never posted what happened
when Brooks and I went to Cincy to put the engine in
Gumby.  Since it's been nearly a week, I feel
sufficently recovered physically and psychologically to
write what happened, and I'm sure those of you who have
gone somewhere to stick an engine in have similar
stories to tell.
The parts (replacements for those damaged in shipping)
showed up as promised on Wednesday night and we had the
engine assembled (except for a muffler) and in Brooks'
van before we left to go down on Thursday.  Brooks
picked my up (it's about an hour south to Bloomington
from Indy) and we headed towards Ted and the van.  As
we stopped for a Mc Donald's break in Nashville (IN),
Brooks' van started doing funky electrical things...it
had the hot start problem, but more than that, the
console lights were going on and off.  
We stupidly decided that this must have been an anomoly
(yeah, right) and headed east once again.  We got to
Ted's shop about 2:00 in the afternoon, rolled my van
out, and had at it.  As you can imagine, two guys (one
with a bright green '76 westy, and gumby, a bright
green '71) pulling out an engine in a parking lot can
attract a crowd, and we did; all the gainfully
unemployed folks in Ted's neighborhood (or so it
seemed) showed up to tell us VW stories.  Getting the
old engine out went pretty smoothly, except for the
fact that we had forgotten about the accelerater cable
and broke it off at the pedal end.  No problem, I say,
I have another one; (some foreshadowing music here
would be good).

Anyway, the first major hurdle we face was in
installing the heat risers; the bolt arrangement on the
top of the new engine is different- instead of a long
bolt to go under the heatriser/carb. deal there's a
short engine stud.  Which means the manifold bolts (on
the right side) won't mate.  Ted was headed out the
door (it was now about 5:30) but fortunately he's a
jeweler, and had a jeweler's saw ready to cut enough
out of the bottom of the piece so it would fit; ugh,
several long minutes gone there.  Next comes the fun
part, positioning the engine, putting the mustache bar
on, hooking everything up.  Because I decided to go
from a generator to an alternator, there was that added
piece of excitement (wiring? who needs stinkin' wiring).
It turns out the mustache bar with which we were
working was bent, and we probably spend two hours
jockeying it into position (no kidding).
Now, here's the good part, I got my accelerator cable
out, threaded it through...and it was 5 inches too
short.  Some asshole in Florida had sold me the wrong
cable.  Actually, I know exactly who did it, but I'll
protect the guilty here.  UGH! There's nowhere to buy a
bus accel. cable in Cincy at midnight; but you knew
that.  &quot;That's it,&quot; said Brooks, &quot;you're screwed,
nothing's going to work.&quot;  
To make a long story a little shorter, we decided to
cut off the end of the good (but too short cable) and
use the clamp that hold on to the heater wire (I had
one in my toolbox) to hold the two wires together.  I
was sure I'd be driving down the interstate and have
the ends come apart on the way home; Brooks didn't
think I'd make it that far.  At about 2:00 or so our
time, we finally hooked everything up.  And,
unbelievably, it started.  I gave Brooks a huge hug...
There were some problems...the degree pully wheel that
I bought was rubbing (Zing! Zing!) against the tin, and
because of the botched cable situation, I could only
get about 70% percent power.  Oh, and Brooks' westy was
still flashing its lights on and off.  It was now 3 in
the morning, (4 Cincy time) and we crossed the street
to fill up with gas (my gas cap's still at the BP
station there!) and began to drive home.  
It was great fun trying to make it up the hills going
out of town (friggin' huge ones) on 70% power...and at
least once Brooks lost every thing electric (it turns
out the main fuse was loose) but we were moving, damn
it!  We stopped for Chicken fried steak and eggs about
45 minutes into Indiana (we had no lunch, no dinner,
and had not stopped for even a rest while installing
the engine).  We were covered with grease,
carbon....everything.  The coffee and toast and eggs
and steak(?) tasted like nectar.  I made it home a half
hour before my wife needed to go to work.
Since then, here's what happened: I cut out the little
piece of tin that was rubbing the crankshaft pulley and
could suddenly (for the first time) hear the very loud
valve ticking noise.  Since I have hydraulic lifters, I
was a little concerned.  The next morning I got up and
readjusted them; the problem immediately went away (I
think the engine was 180 degrees out when I adjusted
them the first time) and for the first time I got to
hear what a new aircooled engine sounds like.  I just
say there for 15 minutes or so and listened to it purr....man.
I have a34 PICT carb and I'm using the 131 distributer
from my blown-up single port.  It's not a great
combination...the engine starts and will idle, but dies
at stoplights until warm.  Also, the throttle control
deal on the side of the carb. is hitting against the
alternator, so I have to fix that.  If anyone has the
right distributer for this carb (it's brand new Bocar)
I'd love to hear from you.  The brakes also seem like
they're not getting as much vacuum as I'd like (no, the
hose isn't leaking).  I also need to hook up the
bellows and turn the heater boxes on for the cold
weather this week...
All in all, however, driving an engine with hydraulic
(quiet!) valves that is completely clean (not one drop
of oil leaking) is a revelation.  And makes it all
worthwhile. I'd be glad to answer any additional
questions- sorry for taking up the bandwidth.
