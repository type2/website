Subject: Re: [T2] German parts market

VW will often wholesale a part to the dealer for several times
what their OE supplier sells it for on the open market ... yet the dealer's
markup (the spread between his cost and VW retail) is maybe 40 percent

I've said it before, but the price you pay for parts at the dealer may include
a bit of profit for the counter person. A guy I knew  years ago who worked at
a Chevy dealership in the parts department. He told me that if the dealers
retail price was $15.00 and he sold it for $20.00 he pocketed the 5 bucks. He
said the dealer knew about this 'pricing policy&quot;. I didn't really know if he
was telling the truth until a couple of years later I needed a glow plug
controller for my Chevy van with a 6.2L diesel (a part it was in need of about
every 6 months). I had bought them before at the dealer for $95.00, but this
time the dealer was out of stock. I went to another dealer and they had it.
Parts guy put it in front of me and said &quot;That'll be $128.00&quot;! I said no way,
I've always paid $95.00 at the other dealer-he then dropped his price to
$105.00!! I then remember what the other guy told me about the counter guys
marking stuff up. I believe now it was true, especially since this Chevy
dealer parts guy owned a $65,000.00 twin engine Chris Craft power boat. Never
buy from a dealer unless you have no other choice!  Jeff
