Subject: [T2]tranny/transaxle oil fill bolt

i have looked and looked in the bentley and through the archives as well as the libary and around the net and  either looked over it while skimming through it all but i havent to find the torque for the fill bolt on a 79 tranny or a 68 transaxle for a beetle...
  i dont know if they would be the same and if 18ft pounds would be enough?
  i would use whatever they are set at now but knowiing for sure, vw specs .......
  anyone know?
  thanks
  chai
