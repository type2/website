Subject: engine lid seals

The tragedy continues...thanks to everyone who sent me pictures and feedback on the various engine lid seals for 72-79 busses. I bought a few myself so let me summarize what I discovered:

Bus Depot / OEVeedub / Just Kampers:

- advertized as 72-79 211-827-711C
- 1 piece (pre-glued)
- incorrect profile
- solid foam cross section (wrong)
- will fit with weatherstrip adhesive
- wrong rubber material
- $20-$22

Wolfsburg West:

- advertized as 55-79 211-827-711
- unique to WW
- 4 pieces
- hollow cross section
- incorrect profile
- won't fit
- wrong rubber compund (it stinks like dollar store rubber)
- $18

WCM / BugHaus:

- advertized as 72-79 261-711C
- made by WCM
- 4 pieces
- almost correct profile but just slightly too large (hollow cross section with closet profile to original)
- will seat correctly with weatherstrip glue, mucho patience and prehaps a little cutting
- correct rubber compund
- $13

At this point I'm going to stick with  the original seal but I think this situation stinks and needs to be remedied because it's so close to being right.

What I'm going to do is send a small cross section of my original seal to Scott Pearson at WCM and convince him to fabricate a new mold. I'm sure they have a lot of inventory of the current seal around but I talked with them for a while on the phone and they've agreed to receive my letter on the issue.

If it's ok with everyone I'd like to send it on behalf of this list in order to put some weight behind it.
