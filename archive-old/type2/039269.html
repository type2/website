Dave-
         If you can put accurate dimensions on a note to the list, I'll take 
it to a local shop
that makes custom hosing (brake, fuel, hydraulic, etc.), for cars, trucks, 
and earth-
moving equipment.
         In the meantime, have you tried to match it with something in the 
Metro Molded
Rubber catalog?
