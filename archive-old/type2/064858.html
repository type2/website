Subject: 1970 bus value

A friend of mine was recently rear ended in her 1970 bus.  The
insurance company is considering totalling it yet she does not want to
part with it.  The estimates came in at 993 dollars.

She says that there is 79 K miles on a rebuilt engine, orig. tranny, new
muffler, clutch, tie rods, cv joints.  The body is in pretty good shape with
some rust.  Any one care to guess what value this bus might be??  I told
her to possibly buy it back for a discount if they do total it.  I have done
this on other cars.  Any advice from any one on the  value would be
appreciated??  She thanks you in advance for any insight.
