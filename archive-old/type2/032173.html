&gt; 1. In an effort to fix the problem the PO removed the fuel injection 
&gt; wires (I don't know why!). The problem is he didn't mark electrical 
&gt; plugs so I can't tell which injector to plug them into.  I have a 50% 
&gt; chance of getting them right.  How can I find out which plug goes where?  

--&gt; If it's just the wires to the injectors, I don't think it matters.  If
memory serves all four open at the same time.  Just put 'em where they fit
best.  (Incidentally, if any of the plugs are missing the locking clips
that make them 'snap' on, cross a couple zip ties over the plug and under
the injector or something.  Otherwise it *will* drive you nuts by working
loose from road vibration, causing you to start running on three
cylinders.  This *always* happens on a steep hill. ;) )
