I have never had an chance to ask.  I know that they are rather rare in
the states.

I have them narrowed down to the 319D with was produced some time around
the late 50s and 60s.  

I also seem to remember they are 4 wheel drive. 
If I had to space(oh yeah the cash) for one I would try to find one.
