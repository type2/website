Subject: Plastic gear inside the wiper motor assembly
Mime-Version: 1.0

Was wondering if anyone knows where I can find the plastic gear that has the metal shaft (glued or however it is attached) that is part of the wiper motor assembly?  My motor is in good shape, but the plastic gear is bad.  The gear is about the size of a 50 cent piece for those of you who have seen those.  If someone has a bad wiper motor but knows this part is good please let me know.  My bus is a 76.


Thanks,

Kevin
