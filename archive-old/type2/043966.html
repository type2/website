&gt; &gt;There is a small dime sized metal heat sensor on the case of the engine that
&gt; &gt;either gets a hole in the middle or falls off if the engine is overheated.
&gt; &gt;GEX will use this as evidence that you incorrectly installed the engine
&gt; &gt;causing it to overheat and fail, so you need pictures of a properly
&gt; &gt;installed engine to back up your claim.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt;  I was speaking to a VW mechanic friend of mine only recently about
&gt;  the metal heat sensors and their use to claim an engine has been
&gt;  overheated by dubious commercial engine builders.

and my engine failed and the sensor was still in perfect condition!

I had at least 20 photos of the engine installation in every step (I do
this all the time nothing special about that job)

the mistake most people make is when Otto gets on the line he convinces
people to send the engine back for &quot;evaluation&quot; then they tell you &quot;you
killed it because ....&quot; and if you want it back send $$$$ 

I got them because I refused to send back the defective components before
the court case,  I sent them photos and offered to send affidavits but not
the engine itself!

&gt;  But I confess no first hand experience here,it's just what I've been
&gt;  told...

unfortunately I have more first hand experience than I ever wanted
