&gt; Again, my '78 got caught in a parking lot, and would not kick over when
&gt; I turned the ignition key on.
&gt; I had this problem last year, now I have it again.
&gt; I do have a Ford solenoid switch at my starter solenoid, so I was really
&gt; surprised to see this 'hot start' problem today, in 35 degree weather
&gt; (USA).
&gt; My theory is that my wires are corroded, and when I hit the solenoid, I
&gt; am actually jostling the wires just enough to get back the extra amps of
&gt; current to get the starter solenoid to react.
&gt; The problem is in the corroded wire(s) and connections, not the starter
&gt; solenoid.

This, I believe, is exactly what I went through with my '78 last year and
intermittently for a while before that. As with any intermittent
electrical problem, one is never sure that it's gone for good just 'cause
it's not happening now. I thought I had fixed it several times before. But
the most recent period of good functioning has exceeded my previous
problem interval by several months now, so I think I got it right at last.

Look above and behind the starter for an electrical connection that
connects the old spadefoot connector from the ignition switch (that used
to go directly to the starter solenoid) to about 2 feet of extra wire to
route it back the the engine comprtment where the extra Ford solenoid was
installed (on my car, between the battery and the engine, passenger side,
on that flat spot inside the engine comprtment inboard from the battery
tray). on my bus, that connector was melted and corroded. Replacing that
connector cleanly has apparently solved my problem. You might also just
splice and solder those wires, avoiding connectors altogether.

I reached that point only after checking all the other connectors: Battery
cables, ground straps, all conectors on the starter and its solenoid, all
the connectors to the auxiliary Ford solenoid. Also swapped starters in
and out a couple of times.
