Subject: Fuel Pump Q

I should probably know the answer, but here goes...I have a '75 Westfalia
and have just about finished installing a used '73 motor.  My bus's PO had
an electric fuel pump for his carb (no, it's not the FI pump that this van
would have originally come with).  My motor has a mechanical fuel pump.  I'd
like to use the electric pump, since I'm using the same carb as the PO and
don't want to re-route the hoses.  Do I need to remove the mechanical pump
and replace it with a block-off plate?  What problems am I asking for if I
leave the old pump in?
