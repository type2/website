Subject: gasoline - octane FAQ site

Volks,

There is an excellent discourse on gasoline, octane, tetra-ethyl lead,
unleaded gasoline, ethyl alcohol or ethanol, methyl alcohol or methanol,
MBTE, ethers, and gaseous fuels (LNG, LPG, propane), (I'm putting this in
mostly so an archive search will have something to hit :) and most every
other aspect of the stuff you can/might run your bus on.  The URL of this
site is: 

http://www.cis.ohio-state_dot_edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/autos/gasoline-faq/
part1/faq-doc-0.html

note that you will have to join the two parts of the address together as
you cut and pste it into your browser.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
