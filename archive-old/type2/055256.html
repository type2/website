&gt; Six weeks ago I bought my first bus a 1974 Devon moonraker. A British
&gt;  conversion that the majority of the listees who live across the pond may 
not
&gt;  be familiar with. It had been owned by the PO for 24 years and he had loved
&gt;  it dearly. I spent just £1800 around $2880. Of course it's changed my life,
&gt;  I spend alot of time explaining to people how and why but in this instance
&gt;  I'll take it as given.


Hi Max,

As you live in the UK (and you are already on this list), you could do a lot 
worse than joining the VW Type 2 Owners Club. (OK as a long standing member 
and a committee member I'm biased).

We offer a bimonthly magazine, and telephone help, parts suppliers such as 
Just Kampers and Alan Schofield give discounts to members.

Members can get a valuation certificate which can then be used to get an 
agreed value insurance.

We have an annual 'Teach-in' (prebooked members only) during August
at which people learn basic maintenance, welding, painting etc. Often we fix 
specific problems on vans too - last year we repaired ignition locks, brakes, 
timing, rising roofs, flashers etc ect,

Also in September we run our own show VANFEST which is possibly the largest 
VW Transporter gathering in Europe (approx. 3000 vans, 10000 people). If you 
need things like switches or fuse box covers these are readily availlable 
&gt;from the second hand parts dealers at shows for much cheaper than new.

Of course there are other clubs which may be local to you whose members would 
be glad to help you, there is often a list of clubs in the monthly 
&quot;Volksworld&quot; magazine (available in WH Smiths etc)

Before you go off around Europe get yourself a &quot;Just Kampers&quot; catalogue they 
do a phone order service and will mail parts out for next day delivery to 
mainland Europe.
