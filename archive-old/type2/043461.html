Subject: Re: HELP! Pilot bearing gone

Thanks to all who responded to my pilot bearing crisis- as it was my first
real &quot;what the hell am I gonna' do&quot;
crisis. I eventually pounded the old (what was no more than a sleeve)
bearing  with a pointed chisel. It must have been welded by heat because it
held on till the last .  My dremmel tool bits must have been dull because I
couldn't grind it away. Square chisels ended up damaging the inside housing.
I messed up the inside housing of my crank in doing so. I used my dremmel to
grind down the nasties. I then started to tap in the new bearing but ended
up using the flywheel and 5 bolts to gently squeeze it in. I'm convinced the
PO had trouble with it and decided to put the engine back with out replacing
it, thus my transmission leak.

Is it possible to run a type 4 engine for a year without a pilot bearing? I
still have yet to put the engine back,
hopefully by tomorrow AM.

&gt; I received what I think is a new pilot bearing w/ my new Luk clutch kit. I
&gt; didn't know what it was , so I figured I didn't need it. In an effort to
try
&gt; to locate it on my engine,
&gt; I think I found what used to be a pilot bearing. This bearing goes in the
&gt; clutch end of the crank before the flywheel? And allows the main tranny
&gt; shaft to slide over? If so my old one was fried and its outer remains seem
&gt; welded to the sides. Is it supposed to just slide out? I'd like to get the
&gt; what's left of the old one out, and put the new one in. Any advice on
&gt; getting it out. I'm afraid to pound at it w/ a chissle. I was just about
to
&gt; put the engine back in and drive away!
&gt; Please Advise.
