Subject: Tools, pilot shaft bearing

Hey folks...

I posted a note last week about removing a pilot shaft bearing, and thanks to
all who responded.  Many people said that they either hammered it out or
crushed it or used a mini grinder or something.  Someone gave me a great way
to rig a homemade puller.  I asked my neighbor who is rebuilding a jeep, and
he said they actually make a specific puller for it and he brought it home
from work.  Came out like butter in less than 30 seconds.  So what, you ask?

So, today I see that a new Auto Palace has opened, and some unearthly force
is dragging me into it like it has a tractor beam... Sign says &quot;free loaner
tools&quot;, so I figure I'll check out what they have.  Turns out they have this
tool (as well as a number of others I have badly needed in the past months)
and all you do is leave a deposit.  Much as I dislike the franchising of
America and try to support the little guy, this is something definitely worth
checking out.  Hope it helps someone.
