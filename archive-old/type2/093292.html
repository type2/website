Subject: Re: [T2] sealing treasure chest leaks on pickups

My '49 Chevy simply used bolts through the bed.

We used stainless allen head screws when we restored it. I suppose you 
could get a bunch of little rubber washers from FLHS (Friendly Local 
Hardware Store) and put them between the slate and the bed. I would also 
consider a spot of tub and sink sealer under the head of each bolt. Maybe 
follow that up with a rubber washer on the underside of the bed above a 
flat washer above the nut.




&gt;hey folks, does anyone know how the wood slats are supposed to be mounted 
&gt;on pickup beds?  My 74 SC simply has screws going through the wood slats 
&gt;into the metal floor and when I'm driving in the rain, the treasure chest 
&gt;gets very wet inside.  I would assume there should be some type of rubber 
&gt;washer thingy under there but can't find any literature on the 
&gt;subject.  tia, Greg
