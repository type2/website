Subject: Paint jobs

Certainly contacting the paint shop is a good place to start.  If it is Earl
Scheiss [check the German translation] or Maako, you can be fairly certain
it was schlocky.  One good clue is adherence to original color.  If they
changed the color, walk away from it.  Earl and his counterparts buy their
paint in bulk, colors not well standardized;  so if you are in an accident
it's almost impossible to match the color on your car.  Our shop charged
extra $$$ for matching a Scheiss/Maako car.   A second clue is the quality
of prepwork...... look around windows, door handles, gas tank; and see if
you notice paint on the rubber gasketing.  In extreme used-car cases, they
can use a primer that requires no sanding.  Shoot some sticky stuff and then
color coat...  Checking out the shop and the receipts for the paint job
should give you a clue.  A restoration quality paint job is now running
$2000.  A rotten repaint is worse by far than honest original condition,
because you will have to strip it off before you can do a nice job.
