Hey folks.

Yes, effective around 9.40pm Eastern 5/31/01 the website started acting
up.

It appears to be a problem with the (borrowed! big favor i pulled) DSL
circuit we are camping on.

We hope it goes away over night....if not a: there isnt much we can do,
since it IS a &quot;best effort&quot; service, but b: we will put in some
bitch-n-moans to the isp involved...


So, yeah, you'll prolly have slim luck getting to the website.

Mail should still be working ok (other then the aol-digestion thing.)

....david
