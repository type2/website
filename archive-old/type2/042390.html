Hey there Todd,

Depends on what color. busdepot_dot_com has some, but it's not all listed
on the webpage. Might want to give them a call. I'd assume other
vendors have vw colors too.

Your best bet is to have the paint on your bus &quot;color matched&quot; by a
local auto paint store/supplier. Some can even supply in in spray
cans.

I asked this same question, and I think I'm gonna use rustoleum (sic)
&quot;sand #1777&quot; on my mexico beige (LE1M) camper. Doesn't even come
close to matching, but it is beige. I tried it out on the wheel
wells. I'll touch up the rust spots, and get it painted sometime in
the future (5yrs, maybe never).

You might want to search the archives as this question has come up a
couple of times in the last 6 months. Some very good answers are in
there.

Hope this helps,
