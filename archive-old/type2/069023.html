Greetings Campers,

During a particularly slow day at work this week, I ammused myself by
designing a useless but cute decal for the rear window of the '78
campmobile. Using the familiar &quot;Fahrvergnugen&quot; design, I mutated it into
&quot;Fahrgencampun&quot; (have I seen this elsewhere?) Anyway... is there anyone out
there whose command of the German language is better than mine, who knows
if &quot;Fahrgencampun&quot; bears any similarity to a real word or phrase? I know
&quot;Fahrvergnugen&quot; translates roughly into &quot;the joy of driving&quot;, or something
close to that. My fear is I will be driving around with a sticker
proclaiming &quot;the joy of sniffing bicycle seats&quot; or worse! If anyone would
like one, let me know and I'll make extras. Thanks for your indulgence.

Happy Friday,

john
