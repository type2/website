Subject: Re: [T2] Rear wheel bearing re and re

&gt; Is it imperative to remove the rear bearing housing from the bus to replace
&gt; the rear bearings? This is on a '79.
&gt;
&gt; The Bentley states that the bearing housing is to be removed to do the job,
&gt; but I wonder if this is absolutely the case.

No the inner circlip can be a real challenge though.&gt;
