&gt; &gt;From: Access Systems not sure if you got a response on these yet, these
&gt; &gt;bolts are unique in the
&gt; &gt;bus, very short with a large flange head.   they are 13mm bolts.  if he
&gt; &gt;drove with em loose damage is likely, (ask me how I know?)
&gt;
&gt; Yes he was driving with it like that, he thought that it was a sound coming
&gt; from the heat exchangers. But as of yet he has not called back to say he
&gt; needed the bolts. I offered to pull the ones out of mine and let him use
&gt; those or atleast give him the exact specs on them.
&gt;
&gt; What happened did you crack your flexplate?

destroyed the threads in the torque converter, on the little nubs.
there is actually a local shop the can rebuild the TC and has done a
decent job for about $125 or so.

if you have any of those bolts spare I sure could use a spare one or two.
