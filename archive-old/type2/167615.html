&gt; Hello, I am new to the list and also to VW busses. I am considering

welcome.

&gt; purchasing this one however. Any advice would be much appreciated!
&gt;

what do they want for it.?

&gt; Also, does anyone have a ballpark on what the repairs
&gt; mentioned below would cost?


&gt; 7 Engine re-built in 2000 and has about 40,000 miles. Runs great.

they all run great if your the seller, why do they want to sell.

who rebuilt the engine (GEX-be prepared to rebuild it is already life
expired) Boston Bob probably good for another 50-75k miles.


&gt; 7 New tires

make sure they are C or D load rated, most vans seem to have car tires on
them,  these are unsafe.  check for weight range.  check library for tire
info,

&gt; Overall the bus runs great and can be driven away on a road trip now.
&gt; Inspection revealed it does need attention with the following repairs
&gt; in the future: front right brake caliper is dragging, rear shocks need
&gt; replacement, CV joints are cracking, and the front and rear bearings
&gt; need replacing.

with bearings and brake dragging I wouldn't take it on a trip.

. why are the brakes dragging, probably needs hoses.
. absolutely needs fuel lines.


&gt; I am going to check it out tonight. Any replies about any advice would
&gt; be awesome!

where are you located, can you get someone on this list or who knows VW's
to go with you.  no 1971 VW is in &quot;GOOD&quot; condition, the question is, is it
worth what their asking to you, how much is it worth to you. what are your
skill levels etc etc.


. check front wheelwells, probably rusted out.
. check under bottom of windshield moulding, probably rusted, significant
repair
. under battery is probably rusted out.
. what is the engine code/on base of alternator pedestal
. check for good clean title.
. check serial number, does it match title?

Good luck
Bob
