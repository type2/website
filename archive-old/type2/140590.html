Dave,

Wonderful pictures! Looking forward to the compressor shots. I think we got
our a/c from the same guy in Oklahoma. I had to pay for shipping though. I
think he still has some more units available. I already referred one list
member to him.

&gt; Lordy, lordy guys,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!  The kit like Sherwin got was about $400...I picked it up around
&gt; Oklahoma city and so saved the shipping charge....that was the bus maiden
&gt; voyage....4 hours at 75mph one way and then back.
