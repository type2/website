Subject: Re: [T2] pulling gastank on 79 bus


How about if you just flush it out??

No need to pull it, just drian what is in there and then flush it out with 
a couple of gallons of new gas, put the lines back on , new filter and 
refill fully.

Guys, I have heard about sugar in gas tanks for years, but read several 
places recently that this is an urban myth and that the sugar will not do 
anything.....except glog your filter.....any comments??


Check this one....

Click and Clack claim that sugar will not dissolve in 
gas....interesting...I will have to try this.

And this one....from our good folks at aarp...even includes vw content!
