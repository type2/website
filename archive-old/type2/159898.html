Subject: Re: [T2] converting rear seat to bed!

jdd,

yes, a company called z-products used to make the bed conversion kits.

I thought the bus depot had one as well, but I can't find it on their 
website right now.

put a wanted ad up on thesamba for one, im sure somebody out there has 
one you can use.
