Subject: RE: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

How long do you think that you could plumb the oil lines before you put a
strain on the oil pump? What if you mounted the oil cooler under the rear
seat in a Westy. Build some type or box around it and added a fan. This
would help with the passengers in the cabin getting warm.

Remote oil coolers would require looong oil lines in a bus application. The
ones in Beetles only go through the package shelf floor and the cooler is
mounted there, behind the rear seat. Even at that, I think there'd be some
oil pressure drop; and even more if you're gonna plumb it all the way to
the driver in a bus...I'd bet you'd be putting quite a strain on the oil 
pump...
