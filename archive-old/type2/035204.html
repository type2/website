Subject: Speaker location, friday question

It being friday, thought I'd ask this: Where are you people with westys 
mounting your rear speakers? I just got a rather pithy deal on a nice cd 
player, and the front speaker location is rather obvious&lt;in the doors&gt; but 
the rears have got me a bit stumped.
Thank you all,
