Subject: Re: [T2] Rear window defroster relay

&gt; a relay in any of them in the engine
&gt; compartment.........is the relay actually in the
&gt; switch itself.......? I cant even find a relay on
&gt; the electrical schematics....for the rear window
&gt; defroster..........thanks everyone

That's because there is no relay (anyway, not on all
the buses I ever saw with M102: rear window defroster)

So the switch on your dash simply turns the rear
window defogger on and off, rather than sending a
signal to a relay to switch the defroster on and
off...

On bugs for example the rear window is operated thru a
relay, I have no idea why the bus doesn't have this
setup, it seems savr to me.

The wire from the defogger goes from the Switch up
thru one of the metal beams on either the left or
right side of the windshield. Then it stays inside the
roof beam all the way to the back where it is
connected to the rear window defogger. It must be one
of the longest wires in the whole bus...


yours,


Vincent
