&gt; Are all 68-79 Cargo door inside handles the same (interchangeable)?
&gt; My '72 Westy came without one (not even sure if the inside lock
&gt; mechanism works)


No, they are all not interchangeable.....  68-73 should be the same.  70
will definitely fit.  74- the key cylinder was located under the handle and
not in it.

The only problem you may have with a 70 to 72 handle is, will the key for
the 72 fit in the 70?  If so you can rekey it, if not you will have to use
two keys.
