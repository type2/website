&gt; &gt; Sounds like a neat idea.  I only have two questions - where does one
&gt; get dry ice?  And how much does it cost?
&gt; 
&gt; Many ice companies (the ones that serve the food service industry) can
&gt; supply dry ice.  Cost isn't too high, but small quantities are more
&gt; expensive per unit mass.

I get it from a local Ice cream distributor (Jack and Jill for those in
the Baltimore area)
&gt; 
&gt; Be careful of confining dry ice.  A little chunk of dry ice sealed in a
&gt; soda bottle is a _bomb_!  Also, you must always use insulating gloves or
&gt; tongs to handle dry ice.  It will freeze your skin without you even

and how, doctors use the same basic thing to remove warts and moles on
your skin, quick squirt and it freezes the skin, it dies and falls
off...not a good thing for fingers and hands etc.

&gt; feeling it!  Otherwise dry ice is quite safe and a great way to keep food
&gt; frozen while camping.

just remember at ??270 below zero?? it FREEZES everything in the fridge,
it is not for keeping your beer cold without some carefull planning so
that stuff that isn't supposed to freeze doesn't
