Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes!!  Pad, Shoes, Wheel Cylinders

Now that I have this job over and done with, I can
give a little insight to any of you who are thinking
about attempting this.

I say: Do it.  Save yourself, what? $200 over what a
shop charges. This is not terribly hard and your are
just as good as most mechanics when it comes to taking
this stuff apart.

First, The drums are probably seized onto the hub. 
Mine, on one side was.  My solution?  I put stands on
all four corners, with the wheels off, then I squirted
penetrating fluid on the lugs, around where the axle
assembly comes through the drums, and the 8 mm bolts
that hold the drum to the hub.  Then I went to feed
the horse and check on the new baby goats.  Came back
and one side was still seized.  Contemplated taking
the axle nut off, then I got the idea of heating and
expansion.  Got the torch out, heated then drum,
sprayed it with penetrant to cool it down, then heated
it again.  Worked it off eventually by tapping it all
around with a hammer.

The shoes can be squeezed out of there with all
springs attached as well the bar and brake cable
attached.  It is easier to get the cable off when the
shoes are off, dont try and take the horshoe clip off
just yet, I did, and made the job even harder.  Take
all the business apart after you get the shoes off,
pay attention to direction of the springs and stuff.

At this point in time, I had to replace a wheel
cylinder, only one, as I did not get the advice to do
the other at the same time before I did this job.  All
my brake line looked great, no rust and even clean. 
The old guy I bought the van from must have kept it
out of the rain.  So the lines did not need replacing.
 I got the wheel cylinder from Advance, made them
match their internet price of $13.39, in the store
they had it for $24.99.  Taking the cylinder out was
easy enough, and pulling the line out the back was
easy too.  Put it all back together and I found out
that one needs to bring the adjusters out, while the
drums are off, until the drums just barely go on.  Ask
me how I know.  

I did the front next and that was an amzingly easy
task.  The calipers were in good shape as were the
rotors.  Drive the pins out, pull the brake spring
out, then it may get hard.  I had to pry the pistons
in a little before I could pull the old pads out. 
After getting the old pins out, I had to push the
pistons in, alot.  I must have used all 200 lbs of me
behind a 12&quot; bar, for 5 minutes each piston to get
them in enough to have space for the new pads.  Got
them in easy enough and pins back together.

Next came bleeding.  Have a helper ready, those little
jar bleeding kits stink.  I cracked the screw the
farthest away first (also the one where I replaced the
cylinder) and air came out as my buddy was pumping. 
Took about 5 minutes to bleed fully each wheel.

Got it all together and it brakes very well now.  One
thing I did find out, this morning, is that the
reservoir likes to be FULL.  Otherwise, it acts like a
bad master cylinder.  Push the brake, stops, a sec
later goes down a little more.  After filling the
reservoir FULL, no more of this.

I hope that my narrative will help other Bus owners to
do this job, as it is not out of most people's
mechanical abilities.  It is just tedious,
frustrating, and you will end up swearing. 
Nevertheless, I still did the whole bit in 4 hours and
saved my self $200 or more in labour.
