Subject: Re: [T2] more fuel pressure problems.

Eddie

If the car has an injector or cold start valve (the fifth injector) that 
does not shut off the engine will flood and die. It will not restart for 
awhile until the gas dries up. Also it will drain the fuel manifold pressure 
rapidly after the pump stops. Normally fuel pressure does not go to zero in 
seconds but takes a few minutes. This sounds like it would fit your 
symptoms. You might disconnect all or most of the injectors and see if it 
will run longer (poorly for sure) on the leak alone. If you disconnect an 
injector it should stay dry as you crank the starter. Pull them one by one 
and see.


On the other hand if the pump runs only when the starter is engaged the 
engine will run awhile on the fuel in the lines and may even run poorly for 
even longer as it sucks some fuel through the dead pump. Pressure would drop 
as the fuel is consumed with out any pumping action. The switch that should 
hold the pump on after the starter disengages is hooked to the flap in the 
air flow sensor and should keep the pump running as long as incoming air 
keeps the flap even slightly deflected. To check this switch remove the air 
filter and move the flap manually with the ignition on and listen for the 
pump. If the pump doesn't run it could be the air sensor, the air sensor 
connector, or the double relay. This does not sound like your symptoms since 
it would start and die start and die over and over.
