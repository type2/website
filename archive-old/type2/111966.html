Any rumors of reliability you may have heard are false.

I think that I have had one of the best experiences on the list with GEX.
I managed to milk 40,000 gentle and carefully maintained miles out of one
of their &quot;rebuilt&quot; 1600DP engines (in a bug) before it lost all
compression in #3.

GEX still owes me the &quot;Free Bentley manual&quot; they offered as an incentive
but were mysteriously out of when I went to their business.

Oh, and it took two phone calls of the &quot;check is in the mail&quot; variety
before they finally sent me back my core charge.  If you don't squawk,
they keep it.


You really can't beat the new Mexican engines.  Ronnie had both of mine
to my door in two days and they have worked just like new engines ever
since!  No drips, start and idles perfect, and pushes the bus and bug
just fine.

If you want to read more about GEX, just check the archives.
