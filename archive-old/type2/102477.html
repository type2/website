Subject: pre-smog tuneup findings

hey list,

76 bus w/ 79 cal spec engine

old plugs:

1 tan/gray light oil fouling w8rcp?
2 newer plug by mechanic w7something
3 typical of 1
4 heavy oil fouling, deposits on electode, damage
  to the prong(sorry) part of it.

new plugs: w8cc air seals in place

timing dynamic to 5after but it wanders?

new oil chevron 30wt

new filter mahle per spec

distributor cap contacts were pretty green

O2 sensor 1 year old pretty black

because.......

I was missing one bolt and had two loose ones at my
catalytic to Y-pipe flange! I've been having a lot of
rattle at high rpm's or when letting off the gas,
which I figured was an exhaust leak, and I ran right into
it. New bolts M8 x 1.25 x 30(length mm?)

the air leak was upstream of my O2 sensor, this would make it run rich, que no? Hence a black tailpipe, reduced mileage, I don't keep track, but I've been sensing it.

Didn't have copper anti-sieze at kragen or osh, that's the stuff to use right? stainless or metric but not both at osh. did I make the right choice?

I'll be at the dyno when you read this. Wish me luck.

Billy
