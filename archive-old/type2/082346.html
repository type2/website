Subject: Re: [T2] Re:grounding engine/trans

&gt; have thought of it.  I, too, have not done it.  I am amazed that the
&gt; EXU does not have a ground directly to its case and from there to the
&gt; body, but the PC board is rather deliberately insulated from the case.

I was really surprised that the &quot;electronic&quot; ground in my Porsche 911 wasn't
optically isolated from the rest of the system. Opto-isolators aren't
expensive and I would think that with the noise in the engine compartment
you would get some cross-talk in the data lines to the DME (like the EXU on
the bus). But I guess Porsche was happy putting the DME under the driver's
seat (which, if you ever need to look, is where the puppy lives).

I have a habit of thinking 'little electric fuel pump' when I think of fuel
injectors - but they are actually little solenoids with the fuel pump
creating the pressure. A small solenoid takes MUCH less current than a pump
and thus would run off of line-level signals from the EXU.
