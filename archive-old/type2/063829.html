Subject: Hi everyone, glad to meet ya'll.

Hi ya'll, needless to say, I am from the south.  And I am very happy to make this groups aquaintance.

I have just joined this list and it looks like just what I need.  I was
doing the newsgroup thing and there were more questions than answers.  Not enough VW folks to go around.  Hopefully I will be one soon.

Anyway, I have just aquired a 1970 VW BUS, for $35.00, I might add.  The
major problem with said bus is not the rust, but the fact that it has no
engine.  Which as most of you would agree, is something of a delimna, and
when your southern and no very little about VW's, that further compounds the
problem.

Well, to top it all off, today my everyday car (the bus is a hobby)
decided to have a transmission tantrum.  In other words &quot;the damn thing
broke&quot;.

So, here I sit in my underwear with very little money, a broken trans in a 93 mustang, and
a VW with no motor.  I would ask for donations but that would not be kosher.  Of course if anyone has an engine 1600 DP they would like to rid themselves of at a descent (cheap) price I would not turn down that gesture of kindness, in fact, I would forever be in your debt and would mention your name in a most favorable way to GOD, when I meet him of course.

All in all, I would like to speak with some volksfolks in regards to rebuilding
the 1600 motor.  I am honestly thinking about pouring a few hundred (not many) into a
self done rebuild (with expert advice available of course) and just fix
the mustang when I can.

Come on wise ones of the VW world, gimme your opinions or advice.  I am a
country fellow living in Atlanta with no one to talk to about my options.
Feel sorry for me yet?

Thanks,
Charlie Ford

PS:  I don't have much of anything left except the internet and my hair, and it's falling out pretty damned fast.
