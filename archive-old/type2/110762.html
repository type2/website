Subject: Re: [T2] new battery, not alternator, maybe a short?

Have you tested to see if possibly it can be your voltage regulator?
i had the same problem once and ended up being that i had a cheap alternator instead of a bosch and my voltage regulator needed replaceing.
you can take it to a place that redoes alternators and all and probadly get new brushes replaced and will be like new again?
