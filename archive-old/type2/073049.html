Subject: Re: 71 engine install question
Message-Id: &lt;v03110701b43e8338a6f6_at_[209.214.194.137]&gt;

&gt;Im getting ready to install the engine back into my 71 single cab. What I
&gt;want to know is, should I install the engine hanger/support before or after
&gt;I hook the engine to the tranny.

Before. You should install it before you install the muffler too.

&gt;I've always done it before, but i've always
&gt;had trouble getting the hanger to mount up. A crowbar always helps, but its
&gt;still a pain.

Should be a breeze. Attach the rubber engine mount zoobees to the ends of
the moustache bar before you go to install the engine. Tighten the zoobees
down last, after the engine is bolted to the trans. In other words, the
trans is elevated slightly when installing the engine, then the whole
driveline is &quot;settled&quot; into the engine mounts. This is another good reason
to use a bottle jack under the trans, NOT a chain like Muir says to do.
