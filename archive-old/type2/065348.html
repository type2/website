Subject: Cutting out

Last night and tonight my bus did something strange...it just died, then
started up again.  Both times I was moving along, then everything went
dead-the radio, the lights went off, the motor died.  This happened for
about a second, then it all came back on, and my momentum started the
motor back up again (I was in gear going about 25 mph).

Any ideas?  I had the ignition go out this summer, but everything worked
fine except no spark made it to the coil.  The starter, radio and lights
all were fine.  Plus, the  ignition is now new.  Is it possible that I got
a bad ignition?  I know nothing about them, having never had one go bad on
me, so I don't know how much they control.  I don't think the radio is
connected to the ignition, and the radio also went out last night and
tonight.  Everything else seems ok, and it runs great.

thanks,
Craig
