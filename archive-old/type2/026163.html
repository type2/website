[...] Not to suggest that you don't need a new starter, but its been my
experience that hot start problems like this  usually have a lot to do with
resistance buildup due to a bad ground.  Have you ever cleaned your tranny
ground strap connections?

&gt; 
&gt; I have a continuing problem though.  I have a bad hot start problem.  I
&gt; have
&gt; added the hot start relay, and it still happens if I drive for an hour or
&gt; more.
