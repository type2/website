Subject: junkyard 'practice'

...

&gt;  Second, anytime you want to try a repair to see how
&gt;the parts go together/come apart, you can &quot;practice&quot; in a junkyard
&gt;before trying the repair on your own bus. I've saved a lot of heartache
&gt;that way.
&gt;

sorry, but that is quatsch - EVERY junkyard i have ever been in that 
started BANNING people from just wandering out and finding things 
says the same thing: &quot;someone went out and 'practiced' taking things 
apart, thereby destroying that and/or other parts the we might have 
been able to sell.&quot;  please do not twiddle with things to see how 
they go together unless you plan to pay for them.
