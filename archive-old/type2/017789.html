Subject: Oil leaking from a 1700cc 73 Transporter.
Message-ID: &lt;3724BC64.1C1DBEC0_at_telcel_dot_net.ve&gt;

Dear friends:

Thanks for all of you who gave me VW supplier addresses in Miami.
Didn't get anything to to lack of time though.

About the subject:    I found out were the oil is leaking from.
Apparently the oil cooler is broken.  Noticing it was leaking more and
more from the oil filter, I decided it was time to check.  I found out
that the oil is not coming from the filter support but from the oil
cooler.

Now, the question is:  Any idea on how to get the oil cooler out ?.  Do
I have to get the engine out ?.   I understand that the fan and shroud
have to come out, any suggestions ??.

Thanks in advance as always fo your help and regret if this is in the
files.

Please remember to reply to me directly because i'm not in daily mode.

Yours,
Pedro Vivas
73 transporter made in Palmasola-Venezuela.
