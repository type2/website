&gt; &lt;&lt; Now for the hard question.
&gt;
&gt; Where can I find a 46 mm socket or wrench?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Any good FLAPS should be able to order it from their tool supplier...Mine's
&gt; an old S-K 3/4 drive and breaker bar; but an adaptor can bring it down to
&gt; 1/2 to use my ratchet handle or torque wrench.

Fine for torqueing it up, but for breaking the thing loose, use full-sized
3/4 drive handles.  I find a slide bar works well and is very sure and
stable for &quot;step-on&quot; torqueing, others like breaker bars for their
flexibility.

George &lt;--who's broken too much 1/2 inch drive stuff on VW axle and gland
nuts.  Sure, Sears'll replace it, but I still have to drive down there.
