&gt; Hello All,
&gt; I am not confident in my ability to adjust my valves correctly.  I 
&gt; attempted
&gt; 3 times today and still they sound clattery or loose.  My questions,  which
&gt; is worse, a tight or loose valve?
&gt; tight

after 60 miles, how much damage could I have done?  Assuming they are loose.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; When driving, what would I notice with a loose?   and Tight valve?
&gt; noise and lack of power
&gt; I am operating a 6,000 mile 1600 Mexican longblock.
&gt; Some modern Mexican engines come with hydraulic valve lifters (just a 
&gt; thought) Otherwise maybe you haven't go the engine in the correct position? 
&gt;  Good luck 

                         Mel
