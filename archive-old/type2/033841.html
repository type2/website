Subject: whirring sound in D.C.
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi Folks,

I have 79' and when I turn the wheels to right, I get a whirring sound from the
front passenger wheel.  I do a little work on the bus myself, but not a lot.  I
had a guy check the bearings, he said they were fine, and said it was the brake.
He cleaned it up, and a week later the problem came back. I am not sure I trust
the guy.

Then I cleaned the brake, that gave me about a day's respite.  So  I took it to
this local brakes guy and said I think the front calliper might be hanging up
(the noise would start-up after I applied the brakes).  $224 later he replaced
both front callipers, so he claims, but I doubt this.  Problem is, the whirling
is exactly the same as it was before.

Any clues, my pocket is not deep enough for this continued shistering.  I am
willing to tackle the problem myself, time is often the problem.

Paul
Washington, D.C.
