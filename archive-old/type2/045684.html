10% alcohol means the engine is running around 6% LEANER on the same volume
of fuel. Obviously, closed loop FI systems automatically adjust, but our
carbureted and open loop FI cars do NOT. If you have carbs, re-jet. If you
have FI, other patches are needed.

in aircooled engines, gasoline is responsible for a lot of the cooling of
the engine; move more fuel thru, and the engine will cool off (mileage goes
down of course).
