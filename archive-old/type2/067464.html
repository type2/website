Subject: RE:Ben Pon

Joseph's observation about Ben Pon being the &quot;father&quot; of the Type 2 is for 
the most part true...however he did not design the parts carrier for the VW 
factory, that vehicle had been in existance during the war. St Pon's claim 
to fame was seeing that parts carrier, getting an inspiration, and then 
sketching out on a scrap piece of paper what became the general layout and 
&quot;shape&quot; for the Type 2.
