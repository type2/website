hi guys
anybody need a three bay gas station building complete with roll up
doors ?
this is a dismantle and move it yourself project.
not too difficult with a torch and or grinder to disconnect the sections

a flat bed truck would also be very handy

cheap garage at only 2000.00

give me a call if interested
