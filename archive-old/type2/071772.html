X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Gentlepersons-
                      ...If not fiberglass resin, try U.S. Chemical &amp; 
Plastics (USC) &quot;All-Metal&quot;
body filler. It's an aluminum-filled body putty that's almost as easy to use 
as Bondo
but dries to a water proof finish. There are paints for the DIYer, but the 
best are
from the UK and are used to get a &quot;coach-built&quot; finish...Lots of work, but 
done pro-
perly the equal of most economy paint jobs and better than many. I haven't 
been able
to ferret out a USA supplier, though...
