&gt;Rick,
&gt;  I had the same thought, to put lights on my bus.  My plan is to move the spare tire off the nose and cut a piece of 3/4 plywood to go in it's place on the nose mount.  I'll cut the wood to a circular shape, paint it white, and then mount an artifical wreath with lights to the wood.  To power the lights I was going to get a low wattage inverter which would get wired to the battery through a relay which is energized by the headlight switch.
&gt;  Is it legal? I don't know, I guess I'll find out soon enough.

I started with the lit wreath on the spare about five years ago, and since then I've gotten progressively more carried away.  :-)  I used two methods to attach the lights - the first was to ziptie the lights to mirrors, wipers, and various small holes that existed in the fender lips and drip rail.  The second is to use the little suction cup light holders that they sell at Wal Mart to attach lights to the windows.  They stay on suprisingly well.  The lights are powered by a 600 Watt inverter that I have mounted inside the camper.  With over 800 lights on the bus, the inverter was  at about 2/3 capacity.  I ran into a problem with the tiny fuses blowing because of chaining many strings of lights together, and the lights wound around the antenna interfere with radio reception, but other than that, no major problems.

I have passed many cop cars with lights blazing - white lights, colored lights, blinking lights, dancing lights, all with no trouble.  I'm told it's quite a sight going down the freeway after dark.  This year I think I'm going to try and put the lights inside the bus.  I'm also considering mounting a small decorated and lit Christmas tree on the rear table.
