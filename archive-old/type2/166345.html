&gt; The same load applied at different RPMS need not have the same fuel

&gt; per revolution to maintain the same speed.

I was with you until the last sentence.  Your conclusion that less fuel 
will be required assumes that fuel consumption is linear with respect to 
RPM.  It is not.  What's more, heat production is not either.  At high 
RPMs, more fuel is consumed, less power and torque are produced, and 
more heat is produced.

&gt; Consider the same engine running up a LONG hill at 65 MPH. The  
&gt; transmission with lower gearing will be connected to a cooling fan  
&gt; and oil pump that are turning at a higher rate than what is happening  
&gt; in an engine connected to an 091 transmission.  This is healthier, is  
&gt; it not? And if it's healthier on a hill at 60 MPH, it's hard for me  
&gt; to see why it would be so bad at higher speeds on the flat.

Again, these things do not scale linearly.  What is better at 65mph is 
not better at 80mph.  I hate to fall back on this overused argument, but 
if it were &quot;better&quot; for the bus to be geared lower, VW would have 
designed it that way.

&gt; As far as I'm  
&gt; aware there is no published research available detailing the thermal  
&gt; efficiency of the type4 cooling system at various RPMS, so until that  
&gt; data becomes available and is verified accurate we're both in the  
&gt; dark here to a certain extent.

Yes, but we know something about the thermal efficiency of the engine. 
All you need is the principle of conservation of energy and a dyno graph 
of the torque output of a 2-liter engine.  Both are readily available.

Fuel goes into the engine, torque and heat come out.  When less torque 
is produced, more heat is produced and vice-versa.  Torque peaks 
relatively low, around 3500rpm.  Above that, a geometrically-increasing 
percentage of fuel is turned into heat.  I would bet lots of money that 
the thermal efficiency of the cooling system does not increase at a 
corresponding rate.  Real-world observations over 18 years of driving my 
fully-instrumented bus seem to back this up - the engine heats up 
dramatically at higher speeds.  That's one reason I no longer drive fast 
in my bus.  60-65mph is where I spend the vast majority of my time.

&gt; Do I really think that a 30 YO bus should be driven at high speed on  
&gt; modern fuel alongside typical drivers yakking on cell-phones,  
&gt; checking their mail on the crackberry and slurping a double-frothed  
&gt; latte?? HELL NO!!! 

I definitely agree with that.  :-)
