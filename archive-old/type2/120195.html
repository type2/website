&gt;Subject: Third wire on Generator where goes?
&gt;Message-ID:
&lt;20040116171220.17936.qmail_at_web14810.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

&gt;1600 DP, 12volt system.  On the generator there are
&gt;the two terminals that connect with wire to the
&gt;voltage regulator.  There is also a third screw on
top
&gt;toward the front (front means front ;^) of the
&gt;gernerator where another wire attaches with a
&gt;ring-type connector.
&gt;Where does this third wire go to?  Does it just go to
&gt;a body ground???

It's a ground wire. It connects to the base of the
voltage regulator to ensure the lowest possible
voltage drop between the generator and regulator.
