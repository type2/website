Subject: Re: [T2] Re: T2: Oily To Rise

Propane is still available, in fact most stations are equiped for it. No
surprize .40 per liter propane, .69 liter cheap gas. fwiw, I always used
synthetic in the GM, since switching to 10-30 I see higher idle pressure

&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt; Here's my reasoning: Under operating load conditions the internal
engine
&gt;
&gt; temps are going to be relatively constant regardless of the external air
&gt;
&gt; temperature, so if we need to run a heavier oil in the summer to cool and
&gt;
&gt; lubricate our engines, shouldn't we also need that same protection in the
&gt;
&gt; winter? Also, does the alleged wear at startup do more damage than the
wear
&gt;
&gt; caused by extended operation with a light weight oil?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Any theories, ideas, two bit opinions?

&gt; Racers have a pricey option to the cold start...An external electric oil
&gt; pump that brings the oil and pressure up before engaging the starter.
&gt; Another &quot;solution&quot; is propane fuel which burns cleaner and doesn't
&gt; wash the cylinder walls as gas does. At over 100 octane, even allows
&gt; for higher CR's for more efficency and cleaner exhaust. There was,
&gt; and still might be, an at-home refueling system - pretty sure this was
&gt; available in Canada for a while.
