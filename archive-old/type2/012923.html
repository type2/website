My fuel lines have an outer crust on them. Just a surface layer of 
rust.

They are about 1/4&quot; thick.

How do I tell if they are OK on my Westie?

I had the bus checked out by the heater guy and asked about the 
other lines, then tonight, I noted the main line across the rear of the 
seating area was out of it's clip. Putting it in it's clip seemed to 
strain the mounts on the fuel pump for the gas heater. I wonder if 
there is not a way to adjust that length for comfort.

If a full system replacement is recommended, what kind of line 
should I use? Where should I get it in Canada? I am currently using 
a heavy duty rubber hose for the gas heater encased in plastic 
sheathing to protect it where exposed. They use this stuff in the big 
rigs for thier diesel heaters.
