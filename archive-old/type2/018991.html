&gt; Im looking at having the battery area replace on my '71 single cab, but the
&gt; guy who does this type of work said he would have to fabricate it all. I
&gt; asked why and he told me that he didnt know where to get replacement panels
&gt; for single cabs. Are they different than normal bus ones and if so, does
&gt; anyone know who carries them?

BUTT CHEEKS! we'll have to do a search in the archives for that!
Yes, pickups have squarer corners so the gates join at a point. This
squareness carries clear down to the battery box floor and on 58 and
earlier even the bumpers were different. Several years ago one used to
be able to buy battery box floors from Tabco- they were Dansk, actually-
doubt they are still available.
Maybe from Allen Schoefield (spelling?) in England? (Sorry, mislaid my
bookmarks file while cleaning up hard drive, now starting from scratch!)
