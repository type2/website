Subject: Re: [T2] 80-83 Vanagon site search

Thanks For the suggestions Richard. I looked around Vanagon_dot_com but haven't 
found what I was after yet. Was hoping to find pictures of an engine going 
back into an 80-83, Showing these tubes and other things that I should have 
taken pictures of. I guess I should take some as I put mine back in and see 
if I can figure out how to build a site to display them.

I haven't checked the part number yet but I hope to this afternoon if the 
snow slows down.

Thanks again,
Tom

&gt; http://www.vanagon_dot_com/ maybe of some help to you.
&gt;
&gt; Suggestion. If you are unsure which ends connect to the engine see which 
&gt; end
&gt; the seals fit into. Perhaps the part numbers are printed on the engine 
&gt; side
&gt; like the baywindow versions? I don't own a Vanagon but I own one on TV.
