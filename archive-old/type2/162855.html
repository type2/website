Jason featured:
&gt;  you will be paying for a Removal and  replacement of the engine 
&gt;which should be a good chunk of change.

	(I take 'replacement' to mean here 'putting it back in'.)
	A mechanic similarly remarked ominously to me, as if any 
repair entailing engine-removal must be expensive.
	But what about the ostensibly contradictory line &quot;the motor 
is held in by only 4 bolts&quot;?
	Having done only peripheral work on any VW, as opposed to 
engine-removal &amp; reinstatement, I am ignorant on this, and I suspect 
some other T2 bods are also.
