 Useless trivia:  A nutria is a very large rodent, found in the
 southern United States.  They look a lot like large, heavy-set dog
 with medium-length hair.
 
 Kind of weird that someone would go out of their way to try to make
 something the same colour as a nutria.... &gt;&gt;

Volkswagen was really weird in the early 60's with their color names for
upholstery and paint.
Another bit of useless trivia -  Volkswagen provided color matched Running
Board Covers thru 1966.  One color that raised eyebrows was Genetian Blue.
 Bob Scott of Vintage Parts and my late father (RIP) always called it
&quot;Genital Blue&quot;........That's what I've always called it since. :-D
