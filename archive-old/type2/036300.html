Subject: Re: car talk

All,

Geez, and I thought Click-N-Clack were idiots...now we
get to hear it from the 'touchy-feelies' on NPR, too!

I've had friends who owned most of the cars mentioned
on the &quot;worst car&quot; list (Vega, Chevette, Volare,
Cimmaron, X-1/9, Pinto, Gremlin) and *every* single
one of them *swore* by their car. In fact, some of
these vehicles were very innovative at the time
(Vega's even had an aluminum engine block!) and few
can argue with the simplicity or longevity of the
Pinto.

Of course, these guys also 'worked' on their own
vehicles. Something that most of the ol' NPR crowd
would ever consider...it's too hard to work that
subject in during intermission at the opera, I
guess...

The difference between my friends listed above and the
fools who called into the program, is that the callers
don't know what value is. They buy into the hype on tv
about how safe and environmentally safe the new
$30,000.00 Honda Accord is. 

Sure, they don't need much maintenance compared our
busses (not over the short-haul, anyway)...but what
about that $30,000.00 + high-end insurance??????!!!!! 

Also, what happens the very day they make that last
car-payment??? &quot;Gee, honey, this car's almost *five*
years old....it's a junker! What say we trade it in on
a new one??????&quot; The cycle is repeated, again and
again.

People get sucked into this
&quot;newer-is-better-and-if-*it's*-better-then-*I'm*-better&quot;
brand of consumerism. Hey, I was there once myself; I
even bought a brand new Hyundai, which truly *is* the
worst car of the Millenium!

Never again. Not for me, anyway.


Why is it that most people today want the newest,
fastest, most luxurious car available; but we bus
owners want the oldest, slowest, least luxurious
vehicles around????!!! ;-)

Is it because we are stupid, or is it because we
understand what true value is?


One last little rant, then I'll get off the
soap-box... Just after moving here, a well-meaning
neighbor came by and told me he &quot;knew of a Toyota
Celica (or some other mid-'80s econobox) with a blown
head-gasket for $800.00...&quot;. He actually thought I
just bought my '69 Westy &quot;to get me by&quot;! 

He was quite taken back when I told him that not only
had I spent months searching for my bus, but it was
also the best vehicle I'd ever owned. Needless to say,
that was the one and only time he ever spoke to me,
even though our kids play together every day!!!!;-) 


I guess it's just as well that these folks keep their
heads in the sand.....it means more parts for the rest
of us;-)

&gt; Did anyone hear this weekends Car Talk on NPR.  The
&gt; had a show where the
&gt; audience nominated the 10 worst cars of the
&gt; millennium.  Guess what was
&gt; on that list - that's right, our beloved bus. 
&gt; Comments, no handling, no
&gt; heat, no anything, a death trap in a front end
&gt; collision but then it
&gt; would be impossible to go fast enough to hit
&gt; anything in the front. 
&gt; Other nominees - Chevy Vega and Chevete, Plymouth
&gt; Valarie, Fiat x 1/9,
&gt; Renualt Dalphine and Le Car, Cadilac Cimmoron, Ford
&gt; Expidition, any car
&gt; from Dihatsu, VW Thing, Ford Pinto, AMC Gremalin. 
&gt; Just thught I lit you
&gt; guys know (PS I know i have some misspelling here)
