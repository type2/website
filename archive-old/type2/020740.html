Subject: [T2] Analyzing my clutch noise.....
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Yes Doktor Tim, I will have to pull engine!
-Quoth Tom Nessick re the grinding whirrr when I let the clutch out (in
gear): &quot;It (pilot bearing) has failed and is turning the input shaft
even when the clutch is pushed in.&quot;
   Yeah, but the noise comes NOT when clutch is pushed in but let out! 
I agree that if in gear, revving the engine makes the flywheel (bearing)
spin around the input shaft if the clutch pedal is depressed- but then I
do not get the noise!
Yes, I said the pilot needle bearing was suspect because I had a symptom
after a wet night of trans &quot;locked&quot; to the engine when I started it in
neutral, wouldn't go into gear, or started it in gear with cluch pedal
in, it lurched forward.  Broke it free by locking the wheels and turning
it over.   Coulda been locked needlbearing/shaft or coulda been friction
plate &quot;welded&quot; a bit to flywheel or pressure plate.  Now if pilot
bearing is trashed, wouldn't it allow a lot of input shaft play, which
means friction  disk play (wobble) and chatter when you let the clutch
out, or even still grabbing a bit when in gear but pedal is depressed?  
This is not chatter, but I can't tell if noise is disk against
flywheel/plate  or input shaft against bearing.   Yes, Perhaps there
isn't a lot of play, but bearing isn't turning causing friction noise?? 
Hmmm-time for the thinking cap-when engine is turning and clutch is all
the way in, flywheel/pressure plate is spinning, but not the input
shaft/disk if in neutral.  Put it in gear, let clutch pedal out, the
flywheel/pressure plate is pushing onto the disk, whose difference in
rotational speed (trying to turn the trans/wheels to drive off) makes
the input shaft spin on the bearing until its speed matches the engine
and pilot bearing doesn't turn.  Now if I let the pedal out in neutral,
there is no noise but conditions are the same-  perhaps it comes up to
speed very quickly then and noise due to bearing isn't noticed?   If one
is driving and puts the clutch in, the input shaft is still spinning
(wheels moving)- wouldn't you then get the noise when engine is stopped
and you are costing down a hill?  Gotta try that.  I should say there is
no noise while driving and I push the clutch in to shift- comes only
when let out (and is less while driving).
      Now a past symptom comes to mind that hasn't been happening
lately, and I developed the habit of putting it in neutral and not
keepin the clutch in-  at times when waiting with clutch depressed, one
felt like the gear was &quot;grabbing&quot; intermittantly, which could have been
the input shaft &quot;gripping&quot; the bearing now and then- perhaps loose
&quot;needles&quot; getting grabbed?   MB 78 Westy 221,000 miles original engine
