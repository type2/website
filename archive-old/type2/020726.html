Subject: Wiper and Rear Defroster Failure.....

During these past rain storms that we are now thankfully done with, my
wipers went out.._dot_details....

I was jiggling the defroster switch, which at that point had been
working, but there were tiny blue sparks coming out from the switch
where it meets the dash, suddenly, the sparks stopped and so did my
windshield wipers at the exact same time.....so neither the wipers nor
the defroster works...

Is this just a matter of replacing the deforst switch itself, some
relay, or........?

thanks in advance...
