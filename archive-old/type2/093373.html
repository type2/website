&gt;Hey Bob! (and everyone on the list)
&gt;I saw a few picts of the new &quot;microbus&quot; I do not think it is garbage but I 
&gt;do think that It is of no relevance to a REAL bussey!! I'm just a yonge 
&gt;veedubber and I do not have a bussey but I really do want one! gee I do 
&gt;not know what to think!! The originals still rock!! drive till you die!!
======================&gt;
OK, so I over reacted.
maybe it's a post polio syndrome sort of thing.

If and when I finally do see one of the new busses on the road, I'll accept 
it as being OK.
