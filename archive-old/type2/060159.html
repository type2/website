Subject: Sunroof fix

Hey Y'all,
  I have a problem that may be familiar to some of you, the sunroof in 
my 70 Bus is not working at all. The problem is the cables are broken. I 
tried to get new cables but was greeted with laughs and dumb looks. The 
only place to even list a cable is West Coast Metric and they list them 
at $125 a side and not available. So now I have a sunroof and no cables 
to make it work, sound familiar? Well I am working on a solution to the 
problem. It will convert the sunroof to a manual sliding roof that locks 
in the forward(closed) position. To open it you will unlock it and slide 
it back with a push. No cranking the handle. I will make the stuff to 
work on my Bus first and if there is any interest I will make up a 
convertion kit for your Busses.
  The sunroof headliner will be retained but be cut down to fit into the 
recess in the panel. The hand crank will stay so there is not a hole in 
the roof, and all else will look stock I hope. When I have it done I 
will post some pictures on my web page for you to look at.
   Is there anyone interested in a kit like this for your Bus? We have 
to do something because the new cables are not available, N.O.S. would 
be BIG $$$, and there are not many good cables left in the wrecking 
yards to be had. I want to have a working Sunroof, but I am on a limited 
budget, hence the manuel kit convertion.
   Please E-mail me your questions and comments on this as well as 
suggestions. I hope that the kit will cost less than $50 and maybe even 
less than $30. So please give me input.
