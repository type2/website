Subject: the gear oil saga (very short)

both redline and AMSOIL brands carry a gl-4 gear lube.  and AMSOIL's is
a 80w-90 gl-4, and you get the benefits of synthetic with the above
mentioned brands.  

have fun with your oil selections..8-)..&lt;~~~~he is smiling to ward off
the synthetic oil flame wars!!
