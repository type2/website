Subject: FW: [T2] thermostat for Type IV engine?

Hi Steve,
I guess the temp rating I got is ok, based on what you said.  I will indeed
adjust the flaps accordingly.  What I'm thinking now, is that the original
thermostat may have been ok, since I was testing it at 65C (when it's rated
85).  Oh well, if that's the case I have a spare now.
Indeed, a lot of engineering went into the design of these aircooled
engines, including the cooling components (ie. thermostat etc.).  Given that
I plan on driving it mostly in the summer, some people had said that a
thermostat was not absolutely warranted, and many rebuilders apparently
don't bother putting one on, but I felt that it's important to build the
engine as the designers intended, which meant to include the thermostat etc.
I gather they're getting scarce now.  VW Canada still have a dozen or so in
their national inventory.  NOt cheap: about $50US for just the thermostat
(no bracket, hardware or cable).
Regards,

&gt;&gt;I'm so glad you decided to agree with all the highly trained engineers and
VW who spent millions of dollars on developing and manufacturing thermostats
for the air-cooled engine ;-)

&gt;&gt;Since most engine wear occurs at oil temps below 180 F, your engine needs
a
thermostat. The increased exhaust emissions that occur during warm up
combined with more strict pollution standards ('75 I think) have changed the
temp rating.  Make sure you adjust the t-stat so that by full warm up the
flaps are fully open. Your engine will last much longer.
