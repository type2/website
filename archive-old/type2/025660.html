Hello, all,

I've been away from this list for the past 2 yrs. or so, but dire necessity
forces me to seek out the collective expertise of all you good bus folks.
(oops, I sound so cold and calculating!  Actually, I've missed the list, but
lack of time / computer resources keeps me away)

Now, the &quot;dire&quot; question:

My 1979 Westfalia has begun having shifter and transmision problems.  My
mechanic was unpleasantly surprised to find that Volkswagen Canada no longer
stocks the following parts.  So, I am looking here.  If you know anything
about this, please help ( availability elsewhere?  not available?  used
parts source?  after market?... etc)  I don't know the part numbers, other
than on a blurry fax from VW, it shows an exploded view and the parts are
numbered 56, 60, 65, 66, and 67 on an illustration numbered &quot;29-00&quot;

The parts are described as :  Selector Link Shaft, Selector Link Shaft
Bracket, Selector Link Ball Joint, Shift Shaft Seal, Shift Housing Gasket,
and Selector Link &lt;????&gt; (not known for sure)

I have a strong feeling this would all have comprised a kit of some kind.

If you have any information, please reply here, or back channel to me at

Thank you, everyone!
