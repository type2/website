&gt; Apparently his bus was successfully vandalized last Halloween.  WE found

&gt; Question is this - can the tank be adequately in place by disconnecting

I don't know what eggs do in gasoline, but I would think that it would be
pretty well broken up by now.  Why don't you try draining the tank,
pulling the screen, and running water in quantity through it?  You'll
probably flush out the remaining debris.  If some big chunks remain you
could get under the bus and run a test tube brush in and out of the outlet
while the water is flowing to try and break up the remaining stuff.

After this, you will have to get the residual water out of the tank.  You
could run an air hose into the tank and let it go for an hour or so.
