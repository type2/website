Subject: Re: Window Rubber Replacement Including the Chrome Strips?

The chrome trim is, as you say, inserted after the window is installed.

The chrome is removed before the windows are removed and replaced after the
window has been installed.

I cannot see why window rubber that accepts chrome trim would be any more
difficult than window rubber that does not.

FYI: There are two types of chrome trim. The earlier trim was polished
aluminum and C shaped in cross section. The later trim was plastic and
inserts into the rubber with a ridge that is arrow shaped in cross section.


&gt;I have been told that when I have all the rubber around the windows
&gt;replaced it will have to be without any chrome trim.  The reason being
&gt;that it always breaks the windows upon replacement.

&gt;I have seen the rubber available that allows you  to re-insert the
&gt;chrome around the edges.  Is this done post window installation?
