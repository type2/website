Subject: [T2] W*terboxer Parts?

Volks:

On Tues of next week I'll be returning to a pik-n-pull with 2 Vanagon
Waterboxers. Both are 7 Passenger models.  One has an engine and good
rear seat. 

My question is what parts should I pull.  Are there any parts I can use
on my 71 or does anyone want anything?  I've already gotten the front
seats (which don't fit my bus, who want's em?).  Are there any engine
parts which we could use? I understand there are many similarities to
the upright engine.

Thanks
Shawn Clark
71 Westy
