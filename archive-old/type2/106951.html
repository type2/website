&gt;Ooooohhhhhhh... now you've done it!  :)  I had no idea these were available.  It's not clear from their web page whether or not the stock hubcaps fit - they say the Vanagon hubcaps will not fit but I thought those were a direct swap for the bay ones? 

I called them and the bus hubcaps do fit.  The ones that don't fit are those plastic wheelcovers that some Vanagons had.  I can understand why those wouldn't fit since the wheels are 1&quot; larger diameter!  They couldn't describe the change in offset to me which was a bit troubling, but they did say that with the 215/65-15 tires they fit baywindow busses with no issues.  Me want.
