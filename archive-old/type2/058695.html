Subject: RE: Heat in a bus

	[]  Just a comment on the heat in a bus thread. I had the thermostat
disconnected, and the flaps
	wired open waiting for flap bushings. As the weather started to cool
off, the amount of heat I got
	was Zippo. On the weekend, I got the bushings in ,and the thermostat
hooked back up.
	Way more engine heat! Also way sooner! In fact at the freezing point
this morning, 
	I really could have just used the engine heat. I only used the gas
heater to test it and 
	make sure it is still working, and after about 3 minutes had to turn
it off before the thing turned 
	into a sauna.

	So the moral is, don't talk about heat until your flaps, adn
thermostat are hooked up and working.
	If you really want heat you can't beat the old gas furnace;-)
