Subject: Re: [T2] Rattly Lifter!!! VERY MAD!!

Yeah, I brought my Grand Am into the garage so I could change the filter, and then worked on the Fiero, so I had to keep moving the Bus around. By the time I was finished, and ready to put the Bus back into it's honorary spot in the garage, the lifters had stopped rattling when I started it up. So I took it for a quick cruise and everything was fine. 

That was the worst sound I ever heard in my life. It sounded like the valve rattle that I had several years ago when the waterpump failed on my Fiero, and caused my car to overheat which in turn caused my bearings to wear completely out which.. THEN.. in turn caused 0 oil pressure. Horrible sound...

Should I switch to a heavier weight oil? I use 10W-30 Castrol Synthetic.

Thanks!!!

Todd

&gt; WHAT, oh what can I do to make this lifter stop rattling????

I have had to drive my bus 20 minutes before to get the lifter to pump
up. sometimes it just takes time. 1 mile isn't much time. relax,
unless you have a reason to question any of the valve trane.
