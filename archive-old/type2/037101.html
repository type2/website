Subject: por 15 primer report

hi all,

i bought some of that por-15 tie coat primer stuff to try on my bus.

Here is my opinion:

they say you can brush it on, and this works but not very well, it really
wants to be sprayed, IMO.  It just doesnt brush well (i know how a paint
should brush, i used to paint billboards...) I am sure if you used 2 coats
it would work better... or if you used the semigloss por15 the primer
might spread better.  So i guess i would say brushing works but is not
ideal, but the regular por15 brushing is ideal IMO.

It is a perriwinkle blue color, not really grey.  I was hoping it would
resemble VW primer till i got around to painting over it but it doesnt.

I sprayed rustoleum auto body primer over it and that looks _really _
nice, so all in all i'd say the operation was a success.

So my advice is... leave the por15 black until you are ready to topcoat
it, spray the tiecoat primer and finish up then.  (or get the por15
semigloss black, i think you can use regular primer on that, ask
restomotive though, i've never used it and cant directly comment.)

i wish i had left the por15 regular until i was ready to overpaint, but
hey, you learn by doing not by watching &quot;friends&quot; reruns.

peas,

Steve
