Subject: Re: Cylinder to Head Sealing Rings

&gt;The guy at bugformance said these were used to adjust the compression
&gt;also, but
&gt;said that the correct way to do this is to shim up the cylinder, as the
&gt;spacers
&gt;have a tendency to burn out, letting the cylinder to head mating surface leak,
&gt;which my old heads do show signs of.  This seems to be a low compression
&gt;engine,

I've always regarded the barrel to head rings as seals or gaskets - like a
head gasket, and I would always inlude them (can you think of any other
metal to metal join where pressure/fluid integrity is required that doesn't
have some sort of gasket/sealant?).

They're like a VW's head gasket - having said that I know lots of people
that assemble engines without them and have no apparent probs - and I guess
you can get away with it because there is no water jacket and the barrel
can be 'pushed into' or 'seated' in the softer head ..... these are the
heads that need fly cutting on disassembly.......

I think if these rings were originally intended as 'compression' spacers
then they would come in different thicknesses (like the shims actually
designed for this use....).   They shouldn't burn out if everything is
machined properly and mated properly (sorta blueprinted) in the first
place.....I've never seen a set 'burn out' and leak....

Who would always put em in and is the first to admit that many people don't...
