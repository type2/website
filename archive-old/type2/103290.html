Subject: Re: [T2] Zodi hot shower

We've gotten a lot of use from my little Zodi.  Great shower, as hot as you
want with not much propane.

I wouldn't change the way it works, they have designed the water to flow
through the coils at just the right speed to warm it up.  We leave the
bucket on the ground and the little pump lifts it over 6 feet high at least,
might go higher, but we haven't tried.

Best little bus add on when you really NEED a shower.  If the campground
shower is full, or there isn't a shower in the campground, you've got your
own!!

I know Dawn at PLF is making rear hatch tents and that would work nice with
a Zodi.

Buy one off Ebay, then try it out, I'll bet you'll just leave it the way it
is, very nicely designed.

&gt; hello
&gt; 
&gt; anyone here has installed or used a Zodi  hot shower here??
