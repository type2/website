Subject: Vanagon sliding dr hndl FS

I bought a Vanagon interior sliding door handle this weekend at the 
wreckers.  It came from an '84 and is brown in color.  It is in ok 
condition for a part from inside a 13 year old van.  It has one small 
crack forming on one of the inside corners where it mounts.  It 
appears to still have some good use in it.  I had read that these 
break and are expensive to replace so I nabbed this one when I saw it.
I paid $5 for it and will sell if for that and shipping.  Jim
