Subject: Timing, dieseling and clutch q's

PO of my 70 dc told me that it diesels as a result of having the mechanical
fuel pump, I believed him begrudgingly.  It does get old throwing it in gear
and letting out the clutch to get it to quit, and seems like its the fast
route to needing a new clutch/flywheel. I finally got the time to tune it up
this weekend and I found the timing was way off according to Muir using the
static method.  I got it timed and unwittingly I fixed the dieseling
problem, I think so anyhow.  It seems logical but I never heard of dieseling
as a symptom of bad timing?  My first question is in regards to the collar
that holds the distributer down.  The bolt is bent and is ready to snap off.
Available part?  Okay so I did valves and plugs and oil and timing and
decided I was ready for the test drive down to the store to get some brews.
Running like a champ until I get to my hill and suddenly no clutch.  Turned
off engine, got it in first and limped home clutchless.  From a stop with
engine running I found I could get reverse no problem, so I ended up backing
up about 200 yds to reach the driveway.  My first thoughts are clutch cable,
but too dark to see by now.  Any thoughts?  And why would reverse work but
no other gears?  I'm going to pick up a cable today just to have even if it
isn't the cable. 


Is there any alternative to that tin-foil spiral tubing that I have coming
off my engine and connecting to my heater boxes?  Man that stuff seems like
crapola.  

Thanks, Nik
