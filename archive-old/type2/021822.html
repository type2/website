Subject: Re: [T2] RE: How to use engine stand from Bus Depot.

............
Yes, The tranny is off. Just not sure what two holes to use. So far It's been
suggested to use the two hole on the #1 cyl. side. I just don't want to distort
the case or drop end up dropping the thing on the floor. Still not sure If I
trust the
stand yet. Seems like it should have three arms at least. Anyonelse have the
floor stand from Bus Depot?
Thanks,

&gt; Where the engine bolts to the transmission is where the engine bolts to the
&gt; stand.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;What two holes do I use to bolt it up to?
