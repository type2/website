can't help you with other real questions, but

Station wagon = Kombi = VIN of 23something.

Funny vw AD from the seventies pictured a squareback next to a bus with the
caption under the bus reading &quot;If this is a station wagon...&quot;  and then under
the squareback/411/412, &quot;...then what is this?&quot;
