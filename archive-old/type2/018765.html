Background: Saturday I dropped the engine out of my new '77, in order to
determine the source of (1) the flecks of bearing material I found under
the oil sump screen and (2) the source of the valve-like noise that
persisted after valve adjustment.  This engine ran smoothly and evenly
(I did the old pull one plug wire at a time in lieu of a compression
test), but had a badly misaligned valve cover gasket and a running oil
leak there when I got it; so I suspect that the flecks of bearing may be
the consequence of oil starvation.  (Always check for leaks after
adjusting your valves!)

Anyway, the flecks, as it happens, are clearly the product of exfolation
&gt;from the inner layer of the camshaft bearings.

QUESTION #1: Is this the first place that oil starvation damage shows
up?

(I could probably figure it out myself; but I'd still want confirmation
&gt;from experience, which not infrequently confounds my expectations.)

More background: I've not stripped down the crankshaft assembly yet, but
the journals that I can see (front/thrust &amp; third/split bearing) look
good, with nothing for the fingernail to catch on.  However, there's
some funny wear where the (top?) ends of the split bearing meet, as if
some material got between the ends and stayed there for a while.

QUESTION #2: Is this a sign that there is excessive side-to-side wear
and thus clearance in the crankshaft webbing?

Bonus Question: What's the deal with the extra oil passage on this case
(GD 041607) running from the outlet of the little hole at the bottom of
the oil pressure relief valve chamber to the oil pickup passage (after
the oil pickup and before the pump).  I just checked the case from my
old '76 bus (GD 012922), and the passage from the bottom of the relief
valve chamber on that one just dumps back into the sump.  (BTW, I don't
know the answer to this question.)
