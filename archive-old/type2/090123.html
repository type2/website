Subject: Re: [T2] Splitting cases; WHY didn't someone mention this??? :-(

When you say case bores I assume you are thinking along the lines of a
typical water cooled engine in which the cylinders are actually part
of the case/block. This is not the case w/ vw aircooled engines. The
case bore is large enough to accept the lower flange of the cylinders
so I know for sure that it is large enough to let a piston (which is
much smaller) through. You have to seperate the case from the
cylinders (those fin things). Take daves advice &amp; make sure you have
the small piece of tin removed on the underside of the cyls. they
really don't like to move w/ that piece attached (as me how I know)

&gt; please re-read that post. I am looking at the pistons withdrawn down into the 
&gt; case bores. The ends of the piston pins arren't visible, nor can the case be 
&gt; pushed back together to expose them.
