RE the current thread about carbon monoxide problems in buses, here's a
pertinent excerpt from a recent National Park Service incident report...

Badlands NP (SD) - Assist; EMS Response, Multiple Lives Saved

On December 1st, the owners of a service station in the town of Interior
contacted the park and asked for emergency assistance with a number of
people who were suffering from severe carbon monoxide poisoning.  One, a
year-old girl, was reportedly not breathing.

Park  facility manager Nick Koenigs and facility maintenance assistant Julie
Ann Hanes responded along with ambulances from the nearby towns of Wall and
Kadoka.  They found the eight members of a family - three
adults and five children - suffering to varying degrees from the effects of
monoxide poisoning.  The infant had resumed breathing, but a four-year-old
was blue in the face and going into convulsions.  The driver said that he
was suffering from an extreme headache, felt faint, and was having
difficulty seeing.  Two other children were
lethargic and unresponsive.  Additional help soon arrived on scene,
including Pinnacles District DR Scott Hall, South Dakota Highway Patrol
officers, and other park staff.

The family had been traveling from Rapid City to Wanblee to visit relatives.
Unknown to the driver, the vehicle had been involved in a minor accident the
previous day in which its exhaust pipe was damaged, enabling fumes to enter
the passenger compartment.  The driver said that he became nauseated and
confused about 15 miles west of Interior, and that several children had
already become unconscious and were unresponsive to efforts to awaken them.
Two ambulances transported seven of the family members to Rapid City
Regional Hospital.  It took ambulance crews from 25 to 35 minutes to reach
the scene; the quick response and intervention by park emergency personnel
was pivotal in saving the lives of several of the family members. [Scott
