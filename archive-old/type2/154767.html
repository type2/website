Subject: Voltage Regulator Harness

Hey guys,

    I've replaced ALL of the wiring in my 1973 VW Bus with brand new OEM
wiring kits for a 1972. The ONLY harness that I can't seem to find is the
voltage regulator harness. Does ANYONE know where I can get a voltage
regulator harness from? I really hate to have everything replaced, and then
have a 33 year old harness as important as that...


Thanks!

Todd
