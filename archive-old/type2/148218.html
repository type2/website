Subject: Re: [T2] bay window market crash?

I'm afraid Rob is really right. The price range you are looking for is
appropriate to split buses, not bays. Talking with Walter at bus boys,
he feels that the day will come when bays will be as valuable as
splits are now, but that day is not here yet. We generally find good
bays for $1000 to $1500. The extra work you have done might merit
$2000 to $2500. The only exception we find to this is that bay westies
go for $3500 in good condition, primo ones for a thousand or two more,
fair ones a thousand or two less. Non-westy campers are weak too, with
a max of about $2500.

 This time a year ago, we were trying to find a bus to buy and
 use on our cross country trip.  At that time, bay windows
 seemed to move fast on thesamba_dot_com, and a really pristine
 non-Westy bay went for 8k.  Now, a bus like that won't sell for
 5k and nothing seems to be moving.
