Subject: RE: [T2] Air Conditioning???

  I C E in San Diego has all the components to do AC in a bus. Last time I
talked to them they DID NOT have a specific kit but did have all components.
Allmost impossable to offer a bus KIT per say, as there are to many
variations on how it can be done.
  I can verify that I C E systemss do work as I live where it is over 100
degrees over half of the year and their are a few of their systems in town.

Subject: [T2] Air Conditioning???


Hey guys,

	Quick question... I was curious if anyone had installed A/C in their
car. Now... before you guys get all upset. I personally could care less
about A/C. If it were just me, I'd drive the Bus the way it was intended..
without A/C. Heck, I drove a V6 Fiero for 4 years in Florida before I
finally got the A/C fixed. But I bought this for my fiancee, and she needs
air conditioning. (Something about being born in North Miami Beach). In any
case, I saw that on the MexiBug web site, they sell a complete A/C kit with
compressor that you can install in the volkswagen beetle. I was curious.. is
this something I could do on the Bus? I don't see why the compressor
wouldn't fit.

Anyone done this? I do NOT want to cut a hole in my roof for a roof mounted
unit.
