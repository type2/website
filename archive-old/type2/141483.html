Subject: RE: [T2] Upcoming Road Test: Konis, Hankooks and Bar Harbor

&gt; The Konis replace a set of KYB Gas-A-Justs which actually
&gt; worked on the old setup w/Firestone 205/70R14 SUV tires....
&gt; But when I replaced those with the B-D's 185R14C Hankooks,
&gt; every little crosswind blew me into the next lane...
&gt;
&gt; While I haven't yet driven in strong winds, there were some
&gt; significant gusts yesterday and they did not affect the
&gt; Westy's trajectory in the slightest with the Konis.


I would dare say that there was some external factor that was causing this
behaviour with the Hankooks. As Don says, everyone who's used the Hankooks
has raved about them. The Type2 and Vanagon archives have many glowing
reviews of the Hankooks, and not a single negative one. In fact, I've sold
hundreds of them (and used them personally for nearly a decade) and this is
actually the first negative comment I've ever received about them. What you
are describing is not normal for the Hankooks at all. I think there is/was
something else amiss. I am curious how you find them now that you've
replaced your old shocks, but then again I've driven Westies with a
Hankook/KYB combination and there was no wind buffeting problem like you are
describing. (Not that the KYB's are anywhere near as good a shock as the
Koni's, of course.)

It may be a silly question, but are you sure that the place that mounted the
tires didn't inflate them up to the maximum sidewall pressure (65 psi)?
This would definitely cause the handling that you described. Remember, you
should follow the VW specified inflation for your Bus (as noted on the door
jamb), not more and not less. (And make sure your gauge is reading
accurately, of course.) Also any other front-end looseness could make a
difference, of course, but incorrect tire pressure is the first thing that
comes to mind.
