&gt;&gt; One more thing about the colors. You can really tell Pastell White and
&gt;&gt; Ivory appart. Pastell White really IS white, Ivory is much more yellow,
&gt;&gt; something like a newspaper that has been in the sun too long.
&gt;
&gt;Off subject just a bit...who thinks of these names? *Pastel* White? You
&gt;can't get much more pastel than white!

To go back on for a second, pastel white was pretty damn pastel in
itself, not at all white when compared say to Rabbit alpine white (I
know I painted the interior of the '76 alpine as I had it and the exterior
pastel, it irked me where I saw them together) but alpine white is
damn white.

Now the other thing, there is another off white of that vintage
because I inadvertently painted the windshield surround of the '70
pickup pastel white (as I had it again), as I figured that was what
it was and didn't notice the code, and it ended up different (and I
later noticed by code it was truly different) than the OEM color of
the truck.  On the inside that is, the outside of the truck had gone,
red, yellow, and beige over its life.  My point is, there is another
early 70's white, and I don't remember the name.  And I thought
in fact it was the one used on campers of '71 to about '75 vintage.
I want to say it is more white than pastel, but not nearly as white
as alpine white.  Maybe it was just a commercial color though.

Anyway I've confused myself, but I strongly urge people to go online
and find some VW chits (they are out there somewhere I don't recall
where) and have a look on a good monitor you adjust for nice flesh
tone or something before you buy paint.  Or see if your local paint
shop has kept their old books.  Or best yet, just go to a PPG dealer
with the computer scan system (we even got em here in West by god
Virgineee now so they have to be damn common) and bring along
a polished up gas filler door or the entire van, and have him do it
match.
