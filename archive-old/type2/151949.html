&gt;      I was considering using the 3rd gauge pod in our dash to put
&gt; something else in. I currently have a CHT in there that's not working
&gt; (that was a whole other thread). Someone mentioned to me, and I forgot
&gt; who... but.. someone mentioned that there was a 3-cluster gauge set,
&gt; VOLT, OIL TEMP, and VACUUM or something that fit in that 3rd cluster

I have that empty hole in my cluster and have been debating what to put
there but I think I'm going to put another OIL TEMP ga(u)ge there. but put
the sender to this one in the sump of my auto tranny.... keep an eye on
tranny temps....anyone done this??? is it worth the trouble??
