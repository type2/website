&gt; I was told that it is illegal to tamper with a VIN

Don't you love the Voice of Bureaucracy?

&gt; I want to remove the seat backs and figured I could
&gt; attach that VIN # to the dashboard location - better
&gt; than nothing I figured. They said WRONG! THEY will
&gt; attach it and only to the door pillar.
&gt;
&gt; They also informed me that the troopers are instructed
&gt; that if they find a vehicle which has a tampered-with
&gt; VIN# they are to immediately impound the vehicle FIRST
&gt; and ask questions / listen to explanations / look at
&gt; documentation LATER!

Sounds like they are laying it on a bit thick there.  Sure, if they find
you with obviously altered or defaced VINs they might get pissy about it,
but if one of your VINs happens to fall off or get lost they aren't going
to throw the book at you if the remaining ones are intact and correct.  In
30 years of driving I can't recall a law enforcement officer ever checking
a VIN number on a vehicle I was driving.  Registrations and insurance, but
never a VIN.  With the number of keying errors that the DMV makes cops
would be impounding a _lot_ of cars if they impounded every minor
irregularity!  I've owned two different vehicles where the VINs had
transposed digits on the titles and registration.

I would also be very surprised if the inspector or cop could tell a
factory VW pop-rivet from a consumer pop-rivet.  If they can, they are
psychic, as there is no difference!

Also, no cop is going to have the specific VIN location memorized for
every vehicle.  Even on buses they move around from year to year.  My
'71 has the number on the doorjamb, but not on the seat bulkhead.  The
cop is just going to look on the doorjamb and the dash where the VIN
usually is.
