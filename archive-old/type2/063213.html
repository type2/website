Subject: Re: Where the busses _aren't_

&gt;        Just got back from spending a few days in Memphis.  Did not see a
&gt;single split-window or bay-window bus.  Period.  Only saw a couple early
&gt;bugs.  Memphis is not a VW heaven: I shudder to think what it would be like
&gt;to try and get parts...

Well, Ken Hooper and I have a plan for tackling this problem. I'm moving to
Memphis.

With any luck, we'll be able to import a steady stream of buses. I figure we
each should have about 6...and then one other car for our wives...maybe
we'll get them doublecabs. ;=)
