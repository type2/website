Subject: Re: Distributor drive shaft position

You wrote:
&gt;Rotate your spark plug wires (at the distributor) 90 degrees in the
&gt;opposite direction that you need to turn the distributor.&gt;

Seems like I read somewhere on the list that the timing for #3 cylinder is
detuned (redarded) by design relative to the other cylinders.  If I rotate
wires 90 degrees, wouldnt this detune #4 instead of #3?

This weekend I advanced the drive shaft one tooth in an effort to get the
advance I need.  I got plenty of advance, but couldn't get enough retard
(opposite problem) since the vacuum advance now hits the fan housing.  I
cannot figure out what would have caused this problem.  Before the rebuild,
I never had any problem rotating the distributor enough to time at 5
degrees ATDC.  The drive shaft was installed correctly during the rebuild.
I'm now wondering whether there might be a problem with my vacuum advance.
With the engine at idle, I get no reduction in idle speed or timing retard
when I remove the vacuum advance hose from the distributor.  Is this
normal?  Also, could it be that not having broken in the rings yet results
in less than normal vacuum at idle resulting in no advance at idle??  I've
checked for vacuum leaks using starting fluid and using a stethescope at
all joints in the intake.  All vacuum hoses are new.

Ideas?
