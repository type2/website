Subject: Dreaded CA smog check

Well, after much preparation (tune up, oil &amp;all filters changed) and
dread, I took my '79 into a mandated &quot;test only&quot; facility for it's
initial smog check.
A little background on the motor: 15,00 on a rebuild, a successful smog
check upon purchase, then a two year sit.
I'm proud to say that it passed with flying colors.

At 15 mph, 2033 rpm:
%CO2 measured 15.3, %O2 0.3,
HC (PPM) is 13 (max. is 204, ave. is 49)
%CO is 0.17 (max. is 1.46, ave. is 0.24)
NO (PPM) is 459 (max. is 1486, ave. is 535)

At 25 mph and 2081 rpm, the results were:
%CO2 15.3, %O2 0.2
HC (PPM) is 15 (max. is 123, ave. is 38)
%CO is 0.19 (max. is 1.25, ave. is .23)
NO (PPM) is 471 (max. is 1346, ave. is 449)

My NO results were the only area where I was above the average, and only
at higher rpms. Anybody want to take a stab at how I can improve in this
area?

Is there anywhere I can see results/averages/maximums for other vehicles
so I can compare myself with, say, a Hmmmer?

An anomaly: The report has a &quot;N/A&quot; on the fill pipe restrictor line.
Boy, I'm soooo happy I paid $$$$$$ for that fill pipe restrictor.

Another one: My timing is set to 5 degrees BTDC, as per Bently. The
report shows 2 degrees BTDC and a &quot;pass.&quot;

Moral to the story is: always pay the extra $20 for a pretest if you're
not absolutely positive you'll pass. BTW, I highly recommend the
facility I used, &quot;Official Smog Check Test Only&quot; (who came up with that
name?) in Oakland, CA., near the Coliseum DMV. They advertise with a
coupon in the Classified Flea Market, $39.95 + 8.25 for the cert.,
prompt, very clean shop, couple of pre 30's guys who, as my coworker
puts it, &quot;have not been around long enough to have learned to take
advantage of people.&quot; I prefer to believe they are honest, don't pay a
lot in rent, and are maybe a little idealistic.

All in all, a very pleasant result to a dreaded chore.

Comments are welcome.
