&gt; If you're only going a short distance you can simply make the bed and slide
&gt; the canoe in through the back. The back hatch has to be open but you can tie
&gt; it down if you want. Open the louvered windows and keep the front windows
&gt; closed keep from passing out. This is much faster than messing around with
&gt; roof racks/ropes etc. and works for me if I've only got a short ways to go.

years ago with my 60 which had a sunroof i used to slide the sunroof open
and slide the canoe in the rear and out the roof short distances and must
have been one weird sight but sure was easy
