FYI, from the KG list: 
Informative post on Porsche oil reccomendations for their aircooled engines. 
It specifically includes the type 4 engines many of us are running in our 
buses.

Hi Everyone,

As many of us know, VW has long ignored their air-cooled heritage. We are 
denied benefit from their thinking about modern engine oils in our older 
engines. The other day someone on another email list indicated that Porsche, 
unlike VW, has gone back and re-evaluated the engineering behind engine oil 
choices for their older machines, and published new recommendations for them.

I asked for this data and he sent it to the list. I'm now forwarding it on to 
you. Note this data includes the Porsche 356 engine, which started life as a 
&quot;souped up VW engine&quot;, literally, including camshaft, crankshaft, crankcase 
and so forth. Therefore, this information is also directly applicable to 
_all_ VW engines used in Karmann Ghias (and probably most all other 
air-cooled VW models).

Here's the data. Note that it agrees _exactly_ with what I've been saying all 
along - that 20W-50 is the best choice for most of us... Note that 15W-50 
entry for winter!

This information comes from a June 1993, Porsche Classic GmbH press release. 
&quot;Regarding engines: 356, 356A, B, C, 914-4, 914-6, 916, 911 (all), 912. The 
Porsche Classic car engines, (listed), were built to fit the oils available 
at that time. These oils are in general no longer available today. The 
following aspects must be considered to meet with the demands of classic car 
engines: -The bearings of the above listed engines show more tolerance. 
-Synthetic oils are not adequate for most gaskets.
Therefore, engine oils of at least API classification SE/CC should be used in 
the following viscosity:

        Summer/warm areas              Winter/cold areas
        SAE 20w-40                     SAE10w-30
        SAE 20w-50                     SAE15w-40
        SAE40                          SAE15w-50

   The oils must have been produced in conventional processing.

           By  Brand:    Aral 15w-40
                         BP  15w-50
                         Castrol 10w-30, 20w-50,15w-40
                         Exxon 15w-40
                         Mobil  15w-40
                         Pennsoil 15w-40
                         Quaker State  10w-30,20w-40, 20w-50, HD 40&quot;


The release goes on to state more oils available in Europe, but my friend
didn't provide them to me. 

Regards,
Richard
