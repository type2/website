Subject: Re: [T2] Pics of the dangers of a front mounted spare

&lt;&lt;The car maybe, but not the driver...Something that &quot;solid&quot; isn't built
to absorb any impact&gt;&gt;

That's right Tonny---
It's made to drive through whatever you smack---

I'd put my money on the guy in the Olds vs. the guy in the Bus in deer
attack---: )

A flat sheet metal &amp; glass barrier in front of me just doesn't stop
much. 

&quot;Hello Deere&quot;

One day I'll have to tell ya about my Pink 57 Pontiac wagon and an new
87 Olds 98 4 dr. that made a big mistake and made a left turn in front
of me.

I backed outa him, and parked the Tin Indain.

His car was toataled--a dead center wack from the pink panther.

Frame &amp; mass amounts of sheet metal win every time.
