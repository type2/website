&gt;  Thanks to Dan Dypsky for this info:
&gt;  5 on 112mm (4.409&quot;)
&gt;  Audi - 5000 Turbo, Quattro '86-'87
&gt;  Mazda - RX7 GSL '86-'87
&gt;  Mercedes - all '77-'89
&gt; VW - Transporter, Vanagon '71-'89

Don't forget, the bolt pattern is only half of the story.  The rim offset
is also very important.  I'd expect that RWD rims would be close, but a
FWD Passat would probably have way too much offset.
