Indeed, if you don't have a parts supply, better not start investing money 
in tools. Lots of details and sources will be essential to reduce risk of 
failure if the object is profit from creating real value. You must be able 
to sell the parts at a reasonable price and have a margin on your cost at 
the same time.
