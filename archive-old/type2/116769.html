Subject: Re: Heater Cable Question

Sorry- Forgot the Cardinal Rule: I am asking about my '73 Campmobile. It has
two levers on the dash, each connected to a heater box. There is also a
lever on the air duct between the kick panels which appears to direct the
air either to the defrost or the floor that is not connected to anything.
Thanks!
Matthew
