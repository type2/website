Subject: RE: [T2] Fun with exhaust!

Zach,

Excellent questions, hope you don't mind if I give my 2 cents? I have the
exact same setup on my '78. '77 solid lifter motor etc...

You are definitely on the right track with your heater box flanges. Mine
were pretty warped. I whacked the edges with a hand-sledge and went after
them with a flap disc on my grinder and air grinder. Finally followed by a
session with my belt sander and finished off with a fine hand-rasp. When I
got to the hand-rasp stage, I threw some sharpie down to make sure
everything was true.

I didn't get to correct the header flanges on the vise because I forgot to
do it when they were off. I just crawled under and did the same job with
them mounted. Used one gasket, a little orange high-temp sealant and nary a
leak they have, even after several high altitude, high-heat beatings.

Don't bother doubling up the gaskets, it just wastes a couple of gaskets.
Might as well do it right.

Don't sweat the tranny seeping. I have yet to see an OG tranny without some
sort of crust or wet. Just check the level every quarter (4 months). I have
it programmed into my computer's calendar to remind me of maintenance items.

The oil leak at the bellhousing is most likely an old seep. If there is
nothing fresh, it may have been a pre-rebuild buildup. Some mechanics like
to clean up an engine, some don't.

The oil at the front of the case needs to be run down. Throw a new Dizzy
seal (super quickie test). It won't change the timing if you don't loosen
the clamp. Check your dipstick tube, not a quick fix, but a simple one. They
can be a little tight to get on, just use some grease a small dull pry tool,
it will slip right on. (word to the wise, buy two since they are so cheap)

If you rule those out, re-post. BUT, if you can live with a dirty engine,
wait for the day you pull it to re-seal it. I do it to every bus I have
owned, but I'm a neat engine-bay freak.

Timing is a cinch, go for it! The Bentley has a great primer as does the
Type2 articles. You really can't hurt anything unless you are wearing a tie
and are missing your fan shroud.

The hot-spark can be installed without removing your dizzy. I would though.
Just don't move the clamp, keep the wires on the cap so you know they are
correct and yank it. Follow the instructions implicitly! They need silver
oxide thermal paste and a resistor block that is not included (Radio Shack
and Napa Auto Parts). Just email the hot-spark guys with questions. They
have the best customer service I have ever seen in the VW world (tied with
Wolfsburg West). They actually LIKE answering questions and really support
their product.

Dwell is pre-set on an electronic points replacement, so it isn't applicable
to the Hot-spark.

FYI: &quot;Dwell angle, a term used in automotive context, indicating the degrees
of rotation of the distributor cam during which the ignition contact breaker
points in the distributor are closed.&quot; Basically where and when the lobes of
the Dizzy hit the points to open the points which then allow spark. If your
dwell is off, your spark can either be too short or too long. The timing is
when the spark ignites the fuel at different locations of the piston's
combustion stroke.(LISTEES PLEASE ADD CORRECTIONS IF IM OFF HERE)

Hope this helps, ain't buses fun? Woohoo!

Howdy list!


Spent the last couple hours reading about exhaust and some better
practices for getting it to seal properly.  I still have some
questions.

77' 2L FI engine, solid lifters Type IV.

My extractor was cracked and my muffler was acting more like a loudener.

Replaced the extractor and muffler and noticed that one of the bolts
connecting the heaterbox to the J-tube/Header was missing its bolt.

Last night I decided to tackle that little problem.  Pulled the heater
box, this is on the 3/4 side btw.  Due to some interference between
the &quot;lip&quot; on the sides of the heater box and the jtube/header the
flanges didn't line up very nicely.  I handled this issue with a
pneumatic angle grinder.  It went together MUCH better.

I had to chip the old gasket out as it had become one with the flange.

I noticed that the flanges weren't completely flat on the mating
surfaces and tried to use a file on them but there was a little too
much material on there for the file to be a worthwhile time
investment.  I was hoping that would be enough with the extra thick
gasket to solve my problem since it was getting late and I was running
out of light.

It didn't.

So here are my thoughts.

I don't want to pull the headers, since I feel that it is better to
let sleeping dogs lie and they aren't in bad shape nor are they
leaking.

I could take my grinder and just grind the mating surfaces so that the
gasket is compressed evenly around when I put it all back together.

I could try doubling the gaskets(does this even work? Is it not
recommended?)

I don't want to be that _at_#$$&amp;*# PO sometime down the line.

I also don't want to have to pull the headers and jtubes and get out
the BFH to beat my flanges into submission.

Cost is an issue and I would rather not have to track down the parts
esp if I can salvage what I have.


Other things to consider.
My tranny is leaking from around the passenger side shaft.  The CV
boots look good.   No cracks and no leakage from them.  The leak does
not appear to be significant, no puddles of tranny fluid under the bus
or anything.

I also noticed a little leakage from where the bell housing seals to
the block.  It was mostly dry and very thick, did not give the
impression of a serious leak.

I also suspect my oil cooler seals are leaking OR my distributor seal
is bad.  I tend to think its the distributor seal because of where the
oil is coming from.  It seems to cover the oil cooler and I get some
on the top of the block as well.  I haven't ruled out the dipstick
boot but I am not sure about that because everything I have read about
the boot going bad talks about losing a considerable amount of oil.  I
don't have an excessive amount of oil loss nor does the bus
aggressively mark its territory.

Eventually I want to pull the engine and just give it some love, maybe
convert to mega squirt.  replace most of the seals maybe pull the
lifters and inspect for wear that sort of thing.

Lastly, I have a hot spark that I want to put in.  I have been putting
it off because timing seems intimidating.  I have a timing gun, a nice
metal timing scale, replacement rotor, new plugs, both the bently and
the muir book.  Do I really NEED a dwell meter to set my timing?

I see alot of stuff talking about using a dwell meter but have a hard
time finding any hard examples of how they work or how to use them.  I
don't think I need one for electronic ignition.
