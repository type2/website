&gt; My 73 Westy has been running hot since buying it two

&gt; not found my source of extra heat.  This weekend, coming home from
&gt; Maine, I was hitting my usual 250 temps on the highway.  This is what
&gt; I have:  Twin Solex carbs, 87 Octane,

Should be 91 octain.

&gt; Speed 60-63 mph, 10w-30 oil,

single grade 30 would be better;&gt;)

&gt; 70F outside temp, 36-40 degree BTDC _at_ 3000 RPM's,

Should be 28 degree MAX;&gt;)

&gt; 115 psi in all four
&gt; cylinders.  40-45 psi oil pressure at 60 mph/250F.
