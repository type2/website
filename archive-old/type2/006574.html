How about when you are washing your bay window and when you get to washing
around the gas cap and while you are there you open the gas cap cover and
check to make sure the cap is on and so no matter where you are standing
when you shoot that jet of car wash water into the recessed area for the gas
cap     You always end up with a washed face.    No matter where you stand
Rob    Some rims have the same feature.
