&gt; just a thought -
&gt;     could the extra room be for some sort of crash protection?

yeah thats what i figured on too, but a good foot on the sides? even if you
added 6 inches to each side you prolly get 3-5 more extra gallons.even if you
left the sides and just added another tank in front of this one, you can
double your fuel capacity. considering the room on the flatbed and the room
inside the crew area, who cares about lost space under the crew bench. i'd
take the extra fuel capacity.

i couldnt do that kinda thing on my 74 bus though :(

best regards, dave :)
