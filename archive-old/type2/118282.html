Subject: Re: intermittent loss of power

Hi Access

&gt; 78 auto tranny pretty much stock

&gt; last couple days has had a loss of power momentarily usually while
&gt; accelerating, sort of like when fuel filter is clogged, changed
&gt; filter no effect.
&gt;  intermittent problems are the hardest too find I know BTDT, while
&gt; sitting at idle with head stuck in engine compartment I cannot get
&gt; it to duplicate.
&gt;  
&gt;  any ideas, will check out connectors tommorrow to make sure none
&gt; are loose.

I got my '80 because it was losing power....couldn't get it into
second even.  

I found one of the wires on the resistor at the end of the wire
harness was broken....the computer wasn't terminated properly so it
wasn't getting the right info.

More recently, I'm experiencing difficulty getting it to
idle...running too lean and find that the &quot;S&quot; hose between my AFM and
the throttle body has enough of a crack to seriously leak vacuum and
throw off the AFM.

I'd look for loose connections, broken wires and vacuum leaks.

&gt; hmm thought site was goiing down for a move today????

&quot;Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there and what's so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get THERE. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be
