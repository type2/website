&gt; Those of you who've installed O2 sensors, where did you place them in

The best place on the 75-78 exhaust is the u-bend. On the others, you  
have to wled your bung into the manifold just before the HE. Scott  
Lyons had a great picture of this before his personal website went  
offline.

&gt; Since they need to get hot to work, the tailpipe is a bad place. But
&gt; the HEs get in the way of anywhere else short of the vertical pipes.
&gt; Then you'd need 4 of 'em to get a total reading.

What are you trying to do? Locate a bad cylinder while driving? You  
can't tune individual cylinders as easily as cylinder banks  
(considering your two carb setup).

&gt; Now, I was thinking about putting the bung at the tailpipe, but with a
&gt; 3 wire O2 sensor so that it heats itself. Would this be accurate?

The tailpipe is a bad location because fresh air is sucked in from  
the exhaust pulses. Your reading near idle would not be accurate.
