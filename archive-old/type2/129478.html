Subject: Hanging an oil bath filter

In a day or so I will FINALLY be putting the new engine in my 71 bus. 
The PO had used dual carbs with tea bag filters, but I'm making this 
engine as stock as I can, with a new 34 PICT carb and really good 
condition oil bath cleaner.  There is presently no hardware in the 
engine compartment to sit the cleaner on -- the PO cut off the shelf, 
leaving only the vertical portion.

Ideas? I don't weld or have a sheet metal shop handy.

And, how does the oil bath cleaner affix to the shelf?
