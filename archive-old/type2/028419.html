FWIW and while wheels are in mind, the other people in Adelaide Sth Aust. (I
know there are a couple) Parts of distinction on Grand Junction Road are
dying forever on June 8. They have a rack of NEW Steel Merc rims at
15x6and1/2&quot; for $20.00 ea. Got 4 yesterday and tyres from nearby, great
result. Get some, I say.

&gt; I've got M-B alloys on my Bus, and yes, the bolt pattern is the
&gt; same. But,
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; bolt holes are just a tad too small to pass the Bus studs and
&gt; the shoulder
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; the M-B's wheels needed to be rounded out to seat the Bus lug nuts - The
&gt; &gt; M-B wheel uses flat-faced lug bolts and the Bus uses acorn lug nuts...
&gt;
&gt; Flat-faced lug bolts???   No way, ALL MB wheels and wheel bolts
&gt; are tapered.
&gt; All have steel inserts in the lug bolt holes. All except the M class, the
&gt; 140 body S class, and the new 220 body S class are 12mm bolts. VW
&gt; and the 3
&gt; I mentioned above are 14mm. If you knock out the steel inserts, then the
&gt; wheel lug holes will fit the studs....but you loose the tapered seats for
&gt; the wheel lug nuts. Do NOT knock out the inserts, drill them larger.
