Hi All;
	It's great to see all the interest in the VWOA show this year!  I
hope to finally match some names with faces.  I'll be in a white 72
Sportsmobile hard top camper.  

How about putting something that says &quot;Type2_dot_com&quot; in the windshield? I
think I will so y'all will know where to find me when I am not out
rummaging for parts.

If anyone would like to caravan with the not-a-vw-club, the plan is for
the Annarbor folks to leave from the Arborland mall sign around 8:00am and
meet the Plymouth folks at the sheldon road Ford plant at 8:30.

email me at &quot;u_of_m_engineer_at_yahoo_dot_com&quot; for more info, I probably won't
check this address again before the show.

See ya there.
ED
