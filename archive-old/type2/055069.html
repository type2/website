Jeff: The 2 copper pipes may be a cooler or if there is an electrical plug
nearby maybe a heater element?
Anyone seen these? I have one from a type 1 engine. Plug it in like a block
heater.
Glad to see you guys made it this weekend.
I went camping at Rondeau Prov. Park on Sat/Sun as i chickened out Fri.

Bus worked great with lotsa power. My nighbour used the walkie talkie i won
and i used the one in the bus.
It was helpful and fun to communicate back and forth.

Subject: [The_Bug_Pack] Oil Screen???where is it??


&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I have a 1.8L type 4 engine that I have a questions about. In the manuals
&gt; that I have looked at when they talk about doing an oil change they talk
&gt; about removing the oil screen. When I look at the bottom of my engine and
&gt; compare it to the book(Bently\Haynes) I don't have the round part with the
&gt; bolt where the screen should be. Is this screen only present in this place
&gt; in the type 1 engine? I have 2 copper pipes coming from this area heading
&gt; towards the back of the engine. Any ideas?? External oil cooler???
&gt;
&gt; cheers....
