Subject: Auxilliary battery

Hello listers:

I'm sure that this subject has been addressed.  If there are archive strings 
could someone please tell me where to look, but...

I want to ensure that the aux battery system is functioning before I do some 
camping this summer.  When I took my rig to my local VW shop we determined 
that the aux battery is dead and that the charging system is not working.  
What are common problems to look for?

Also, is this system switched or should the interior lights work regardless 
of the position of the ignition?  (Need to know basic operation)

Thanks as usual for all your help.

Best regards,

Walt Fogle
