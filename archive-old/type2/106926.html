&gt; But the instrument lights are still out.  So I'll be looking for a loose
ground tomorrow.  I also picked up some spare bulbs.

Managed to get some of the lights working before leaving for a meeting
tonight, but not sure what I did to make them work.  Then got home a little
while ago and started jiggling bulb holders again.  After a little gentle
persuasion all of the dash lights work.  Nice and bright now. :O)

I bought Sylvania #74 bulbs for the dash.  The book didn't list the number
for the bus, and #73 and #74 look alike (nothing on the package to indicate
the difference between the two).  Since #74 was listed for other older VW's,
and the slight increase in price from the #73's seemed to indicate a
slightly higher wattage, I got the #74's.

BTW, that was boiled linseed oil for nearly dead old window seals, right?  I
have some on hand for finishing wood furniture, and plan on replacing the
windshield seal anyway.  But something temporary would beat having to run a
box fan in the front of the bus to dry it out after every rain storm.
