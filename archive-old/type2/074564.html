Subject: Ken Hooper

To all,

Those who have been on the list for many years know who Ken is but 
some may not.

Ken has been at the helm of type2_dot_com for the last 5 years along with 
an very helpful group of admin folks, including Steve Dolan, David 
Raistrick, Dave Shwarze ,Thom Fitzpatrick and George Lyle. All the 
work that Ken and Co have put in has been because out of the goodness 
of their hearts. Ken has brought wit, humor and intelligence to the 
forefront of dealing with buses and computers. Ken is a devoted 
father all around good guy.

Thanks to Ken for your enduring commitment. Whether you know it or 
not you are responsible for helping out a lot of people over the 
years.

Thanks
Chris
