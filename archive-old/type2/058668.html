I disagree that you need a temperature gauge. The german engineers felt it
wasn't needed, and if it was, they would have put it in. A well-maintained
engine won't overheat. If your engine is getting hot, a temperature guage
won't solve anything. If your engine runs hot, don't drive it, figure out
whats making it hot and fix it.
