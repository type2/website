Subject: BeetleMex retractable seat belts

Could anyone who has ordered the retractable seat belts from Beetle-Mex
please confirm these are valid parts for a 74 campmobile? They don't
match up with the part numbers listed on the &quot;Retractable Seat Belts&quot;
article at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/interior/retabelt.htm

They are about half the price of the JC Whitney versions. How do they
compare in materials and installation? Has anyone figured out that
installation issue with the &quot;ball bearing dohickeys&quot; listed in the
archives?

Is Beetle-Mex a reliable importer? Are there others? I can't find these
on eurocampers_dot_com anymore.

cheers,
Victor
