Subject: Re: [T2] 1977 Van with Seized Engine

Buy the van as if the engine was a total loss. If you find that the engine 
is better than that be happy.

If the engine is a salavagable core - yes you can rebuild it. These engines 
are easy - they just require care and time when you reassemble it.

Inspect it carefully - expect the worst. Use high quality parts.

Good luck.
