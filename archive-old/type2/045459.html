Subject: [T2] Body Classes

Hey everyone

If your looking to do some body work on your bus and can't afford to pay
someone to do
it or the equipment to do it with do like we do, take a night class at a
local High School
Career center, even some Tech Schools offer night courses.

I post this now because most classes start around this time of year, if
you know of a career
center school call them and ask for their auto body instructor and see
if the offer the class.

To do our 72 Westy Weekender last year it cost us $100.00 for the class,
about $150.00 in
materials used during the class, and then around $200.00 for paint
supplies, so we figured
we had less than $500.00 in our paint job. I skipped some body worked
but it suites me
just fine, Bondo and metal work needs an artist.

We are planing on restoring the truck this fall, class starts Monday, we
can't wait!

If you would like to see the bus before and after, and also see what the
truck looks like now
go to...   http://my.treeway_dot_com/MurrayBus

The 72 is first, so vintage people please go to 64 Single cab section.

Ya'll have a GREAT Weekend, now to get my steering correct.

Meredith
