&gt; I bought a 1981 Vanagon last week and have a couple of questions. It has

this is usually the auxilary gas heater.. if you push it in and turn you
can get up to 15 minutes of heat without turning on the engine. with the
engine running it controls the temp in the van, as long as the other
levers are at &quot;full&quot; heat.  (and it is working)

&gt; the owners manual. What does it do? Also, will a standard aftermarket
&gt; stereo fit the stock opening?

some do, most don't
