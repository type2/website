+AD4APg-   Everyone says that you have to drop the motor to get the gas tank out.
After
+AD4APg- having removed my gas tank from my '78 (with the engine out) and after
+AD4APg- replacing the fuel filler neck (with the engine in), I am under the
impression
+AD4APg- that the tank can be removed without dropping the engine.  Do note, I'm
sure it
+AD4APg- would be a considerable pain in the ass, but I bet it could be done.
Also, if
+AD4-
+AD4-yes it +ACI-can+ACI- be done with out taking the engine all the way out, but your
+AD4-right it is a rip roaring PITA+ACE-
+AD4-


It's not that difficult on a type 4 engine. I doubt if its possible on a
type 2. My engine has carbs and if you get these and the electric fan off
the tank slides out. If you've got FI I don't know what to expect. The
hardest bit I found was getting at the nuts holding the long straps around
the tank. You need a long reach 13mm socket and even then I ended up
destroying the left hand flapper valve on the heating system. Actually it
was so rusted it just fell off.

Took about 5 hours in and out without touching the engine mounts.
