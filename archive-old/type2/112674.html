Subject: Fi components / list (missing something?)

Hi guys, i just bought the following (95% complete) FI to convert my bus 
(carbs/FI).
Below is a list of what i bought.

2 questions:
-Do you see anything missing to do the conversion?
-The PVC valve/breather is missing, any of you guys have one for sell?
Thanks, Ben

Injection components

-Air intake box with mass air sensor (AFM)
-&quot;S&quot; shaped tube from there to the throttle and air distribution box
-The throttle and air distribution box
-The rubber couplings to the air intakes (leading to the heads)
-The air intakes
-Fuel injectors (six..a couple of spares)I have a couple of the small 
&quot;O&quot; rings, but I get more(I'd wait until you can inspect the quality of 
what I have)
-Temp sensor that goes on the left head
-Cold start valve
-Cold start valve cut off sensor
-Idle control valve
-Complete harness
-There's a small vacuum retard that mounts on the firewall and the bracket
-Double relay
-F/I resistors
-Most (if not all) the formed hoses you will need
-Fuel ring lines that feed the injectors
-Long fuel lines that go across the top of the engine
-Pressure regulator
-Fuel pump
- PVC valve box (I DO NOT HAVE!)

One thing I know I DO NOT have is the PVC valve box that sits on top of 
the &quot;square hole&quot; on the top of the engine block. It feeds between the 
&quot;S&quot; hose and the engine crankcase.
