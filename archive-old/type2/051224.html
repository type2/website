Subject: [T2] Contraption Report

    Hey Guys,
   Got a lot done on the bus today. Installed the clutch,a new fuel pump and
installed the engine and wiring in the bus.
Painting is done except the l/h belt line cover. It's stripped and ready for
prime.
The hatch window seal went in easy but couldn't get the large stationary L/H
aft window in. The seal is too big.
Contacted the seller and am waiting on his reply.
I cleaned up the engine tin while it was out and replaced some vaccume
stuff. I need a brake booster hose as
I ripped the other one in half trying to install it  to the engine line.
Also this morn I removed the L/H I/B CV joint from the Tranny and fixed a
leak. The plastic cap popped out and had flushed the joint of grease. I just
reseated the cap and repacked the CV and reinstalled the boot.
Also installed a new oil pressure switch seal as the other one looked
original :(   circa 1973.
The new one was tough to seat around the tin but did aventually.

Guess thats it besides taking the Kids to dance lessons:)

See Ya
