Subject: Engine rebuild question...allowable cc variation?
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Well, we are ready to reassemble the engine for China Cat, the 75 Westy. But, 
I have a problem. I'd like to get advice from an experienced engine rebuilder.

The engine is a 1800cc dual carb, but we have a single Weber conversion done 
by the PO. Further, this engine is a &quot;temporary beater&quot; as we have a 2L FI 
engine (bus originally had a 1.8L FI) which we are going to build from the 
ground up. I hope to have a perfectly usable engine in this 1800cc even if it 
has to run 25K miles before we get the 2.0 ready.

We have cc'd the combustion chambers and measured the deck volume and end up 
with 2.8cc max variation. Here is the way the individual cylinders work out, 
giving the variation, not the absolute compression volume.
1= +2.8cc
2= +0.4cc
3= +3.0cc
4= net

I know that I could skim pistons and/or grind out the chambers, but I don't 
want to unbalance the chamber volumes in case I need to use these heads on 
the 2.0L engine, nor do I want to unbalance the piston weights. So, how much 
variation would you accept for a &quot;beater&quot; engine???

TIA/Don Carron
