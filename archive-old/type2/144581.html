Subject: Re: [T2] bolt size?

Depends on your transaxle. If you use an early
transaxle that required a D bolt and you are using a
later case that has a doghouse shroud with a pressed
in threaded piece, then you do NOT want to use a hex
bolt going in from the transaxle side. The hex blot
will lock into the D bolt catches and you will fight
it getting it out!!  You need to use a Allen head
bolt.

We just [in the past 6 months] talked about this very
thing.......
