  By now you have all seen Bob Hoovers post on the sensor.

 Works for me. Something in the 400 degree range.

 I already have a small CO2 bottle I use for my spare on the welder.

 The size for a beer keg.

 The D-ring set-up is used in every restaurant kitchen for the grill.

 Should be no problem finding that valve.

 The dual purpose is my kind of thing. I can weld, drink beer or put 
out a fire.

 Shazam!!
