May be the brake clevis free play or sticking/funky master cylinder.  With
no clearance/proper piston rest position the master cylinder check valve
will be goofy.

OK, here's the situation:

All drum brake system, no booster.
All shoes adjusted to barely touching the drums.
Parking brake is adjusted a bit loose
No leaks from master or wheel cylinders.  No apparent fluid usage.

On the first brake application of the day, pedal goes halfway to floor
before brakes engage.  After a couple of applications, play reduces to
 normal.  If you let the car sit for several hours, the symptom repeats, but
if it only sits for a few minutes it does not.

I adjusted the shoes after the car sat overnight, so it probably isn't a
sticking wheel cylinder.

It doesn't seem to make any difference whether the parking brake is set or
not.

I have a couple of ideas, but I won't contaminate you with them.  I'd like
to know your thoughts before I start poking about with a sharp
stick.

Thanks, George
