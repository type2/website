Subject: Fan screws

Esteemed Listees,

In trying to remove the Allen head cap screws tht hold the fan on the 1.7 in my '72 bus, I managed to booger one up very well -  to the point that even my 7mm Allen wrench now spins freely in the hole.  I am afraid to mess up the other two, as well.  What is the recommended procedure for getting the messed one up, and then the others without inflicting more damage?

Thanks for the help,
Mike
