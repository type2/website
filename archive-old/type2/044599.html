Subject: Re: [T2] What is that strange hole?

&gt;On the floor of my '73 bus there is an oval hole. Attached to this hole is
&gt;heater tubing that goes toward the front of the bus. Over this hole there is
&gt;a black flap which is hinged at one end and held down with a rather weak
&gt;spring.

It's a heater duct. Some buses have it and some don't. There's a piece that
fits in there to distribute heat to the li'l tootsies of your back seat

It bolts down under the legs of the middle seat.
