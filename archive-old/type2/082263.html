Subject: Paint Codes - Urgent

Hiya All,

Just got a surprise call from my painter and I have to meet with him after work today to discuss paint codes.  So...........  I have a white over beige 1970 Bus.  The beige is Savannah Beige and I think the code for that color is L620.  The white is Wolkenweiss (I think that translates to Cloud White) but I do not have the code for that color.  Is there any kind list member who can comfirm the code for Savannah Beige and give me the code for Cloud White (?) before 4pm (PST) today?  Your effort will be appreciated!

Mike
