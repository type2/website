Subject: Re: [T2] ambulance fans.

Your post is entitled &quot;ambulance fans&quot;, which is the common reference to the 
(original equipment) fans in some buses, located in the fresh air ducts in 
the front of the bus. I assume this is what you are after. Unfortunately 
there is no current source for these aftermarket. However there are domestic 
fans to be had that go inline on your heater tube (that runs underneath your 
bus) which supplies the stock heat and defrost from the heat exchangers . 
This fan is intended to boost or help the heat get from the rear to the 
front of the bus better. Snoopy has one installed in his bus and I was 
suprised by how well the heat came out of his vents. Chris sells these on 
his website:

And there are probably other sources online for these fans, I believe I 
remember them being available at boat stores too.

Good luck,

&quot; Is there a domestic source for the stock heater booster fans and 
switches?&quot;
