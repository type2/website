Thought I broke a clutch cable so bought a new one.  When I got ready to 
replace it it found it wasn't the cable at all.  The fitting on the clutch 
pedal assembly in the front of the bus that the cable fastens to had wallowed 
out over the ages and the pin that fastens the cable to the fitting had 
broken due to the play allowing it to &quot;saw&quot; through.  If you have nothing to 
do, take out the two bolts that hold the clutch pedal assemble and check. You 
might be glad you did.  I couldn't find a new fitting locally, so welded the 
hole up and redrilled it.
