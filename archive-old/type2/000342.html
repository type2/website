I didn't bring it up to the list but I have a story to share (bus content as
well). Three weeks ago I was about two hundred miles from home. I was
working and had completed the job, packed up and was on my back home when
disaster struck.

I went to check my fluid levels (oil and tranny fluid) as any good aircooled
owner would do before a long trip. I turned the motor off checked the oil
and when I went to turn the motor back on it wouldn't fire up. I went
through the usual check list and immediately found I had no spark. The
points were still opening and closing and appeared to be gapped correctly.
The culprit I suspected was the Crane Hi-6 Electronic Ignition I put in two
years ago. To make matters worse I didn't have any of my manuals, DOH! I
figured out through logical deduction which wires went where so that I could
turn it back into a standard ignition system. Problem was the only coil I
had was the MSD Blaster that I used with the Crane EI mod. Well I used it
anyway and that's exactly what it did to my points, BLASTED them. It was
Saturday night and no one around had any VW parts for sale until Monday,
Arghhhh! I had to be back home to work on Monday, this didn't work.

I should mention that I ran into a guy who owned a single cab. After
explaining my plight he let me use his computer to access the list but no
one in AIRS lives in Wenatchee. I considered calling Mike Lewis to see if he
knew anyone in the area but really didn't want to impose.

My only choice was to call my wife and have her bring my spare blue coil all
the way across the mountains to me. Well, she did, she even had a smile. She
handed me the coil, and twenty minutes later the van was running nearly as
good as it did with the electronic iginition module.

The bus traveled as it always had before and took me over the mountains back
to the coast with not even a hickup. Unfortuanately this trip pretty much
put the last nail in the coffin for my bus. My wife has stood by my quirky
ways for many years. As long as she has known me I have had this bus, and
while I knew she wasn't completely thrilled about it she was never the less
a willing participant and a good sport, even though in the winter the inside
temerature was only ten degrees warmer than it was outside. We had a lot of
fun in our bus and I am in the process of putting an end to an era of my
life. I will miss it. I am hoping however that there is some way of
participating in the Great Bus Tour before I sell the bus.

It is with a feeling of loss; the companionship I have felt with being a
contributing member of this list and the realization that my bus is probably
going the way of the steam engine, at least for me. I must say farwell to
the list, but know that this is a fantastic group of people and am glad I
had the opportunity to participate with all of you. No other list-serve I
have visited on the net seemed to have the level of knowledge or the level
of respect between it's members that this list does. I highly suspect that I
will search for a project a few years from now and hope to communicate with
you all again.
