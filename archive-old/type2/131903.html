Subject: Re: [T2] oil light won't turn off

I'm glad to have been of assistance. Maybe this will help my karma, for all
the questions I've asked. I'll need all the good karma I can get, Just got
done spending a boat load of $$$ for parts for my Westy and still haven't
ordered the rebuilt engine yet. Oh well, that's another story.
Just curious, what did you find that fixed the problem?
Tom
