SNIP

After they called GEX to the carpet on this, the
&gt;instances of this nature decreased (but did not go away).  The
&gt;company said they still use GEX heads in a pinch, but continue to
&gt;find that they must inspect every single one because GEX's QC
&gt;standards are not as stringent as their own.

And this is the reason I will no longer deal with GEX. 3 years ago we
bought a stock engine for my son's 72 Super Beetle. 30,000 miles and all
maintenance checks later, it is still doing fine. When this thread started
we rechecked the compression and adjusted the valves. Everything was in
good shape. Even so, I will not buy another engine from them because of the
stories I hear on the list.

I am currently in anguish about fixing or repairing the 1800 in my 72 bus.
(Update report to follow if I can ever find time to finish disassembly.) I
lean to a Mark Stephens. I just don't want the continuous hassle of dealing
with folks who will try to throw the blame back on me. Even though the
first engine has been a good value, it may be the exception rather than the
rule. Too many instances of too much trouble. Ken's analysis of &quot;Herbie's&quot;
message was to the point and accurate.
