&gt;  i just noted something in the diagrams and went to bus depot site and
&gt; did a search on the part numbers.  (021 115 193)  and (N 029 7012) both
&gt; list as oil drain plugs for basically all type iv engine buses.  there
&gt; is one at the screen cover which is flat like the type 1 and one that
&gt; goes into the case which is tapered.

The washer for the screen is the crush washer variety.  It's aluminum and
comes with a new screen kit.  In this image you can see the old washer on
the plug with the new washer to the left:
