FWIW, today I saw one for sale in the paper for $150.

I stand corrected....I guess you folks over there on the left coast are less 
mechanically impaired than those of us here on the right coast. For over 20 
years I've been told by machine shops in the New England area that 36 hp 
cases can't be linebored because there are no oversized bearings 
available...

go figure...

you learn something new every day.
