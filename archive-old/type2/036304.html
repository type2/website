&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tricks on filling it back up? As i remember, it was about
impossible to get
&gt; in there with the bottle, and i tried a few methods which were all
rather
&gt; messy. Its a 79 manual with the fill plug half way up the driver side.
&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, the first thing I do is go out and buy a bottle of J. Lee Roy's
Sweet &amp;
Hot Dippin' Sauce.  It comes in a handy little 23 ounce bottle with a
nozzle
lid

I dont know about the dippin sauce but you can buy a pump where you buy
the sta-lube gl4 that fits right on the gallon jug and you just pump it
in.
