Subject: Couple of ETKA questions

Hi all:

The other day somebody asked about the O-ring that helps secure the sump
cover plate in an air-cooled Vanagon engine.  In the post they provided the
part number, so I fired up ETKA and did a search on the part number -  021
101 269 A - but the program reported back that the part number was unknown.
Looking through the parts diagrams I found the O-ring and ETKA showed it as
* 021 101 269 A.

I've noticed the parts listing sometimes has the part number with an
asterisk in front, but I don't know what that's signifying.  Does anybody
know?

I tried doing a parts search again with the asterisk in front of the rest of
the &quot;regular&quot; parts number but the program still reported the parts number
was unknown.  Does anybody know how to make the search function work here?

TIA.
