&gt;Volks,
&gt;   An informal gathering of bus Volks will take place in
&gt;a central (kinda) location in the Seattle / Tacoma Wa.
&gt;area.
&gt;   Meeting in the area of the museum of flight. (just off
&gt;I-5) we will carabus to Bry's VW/Audi reclamation yard for
&gt;a parts picking party and then off on a short drive to Alki
&gt;beach area to grab something at one of the many eating
&gt;establishments on the waterfront there or bring your own
&gt;food. We are hoping for some Indian summerlike weather!
&gt;e-mail me direct if you might attend so I can let you know
&gt;of any developments between now an then.

Let everyone know I am planning to attend God willing and the creek don't
rise. Shall I bring the Bentley's and some diagnostic tools and perhaps
plan to help someone with a glitch?? Balance carbs?? Verify Vakuum
Schlucking?? Anyone who will be there let me know what issues you might
want addressed and I will be sure to bring the tools needed.

Need times and addresses so I can map them for easy finding in Thompson's.

Keep us posted.

Thanks,



T.P. Stephens aka Doktor Tim
