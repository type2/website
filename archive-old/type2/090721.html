Subject: Re: [T2] air scoops

Wait so if I drive the bus around with the windows down then I'm running a risk of over heating!?  How could that make a difference?  Plus I have a Westy so I have the windows in the back that swing outward, and do those make it run hotter too?

Last but not least, how effective are those scoop things on the back, behind the back windows?  I have a '71 Westy if that makes any difference.
