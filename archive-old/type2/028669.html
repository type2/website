Looking for an owners manual for my '72 hardtop Westy (w/ '73 engine and
tranny).  PO provided a 1975 manual that I would be happy to trade.  In lieu
of an actual manual, if anyone would be so kind as to photocopy their
manual, I will gladly reimburse for all expenses.

Many thanks in advance,
Jay Brown
