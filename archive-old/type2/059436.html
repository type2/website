consult your favorite manual for exact instructions. make sure there's no
crud where the oil cooler seals seat, and get all those washers in the
right place. in all my searching, i've never found an actual torque value
for tightening those three nuts, so i just wrench away until the cooler
firmly presses the seals, but not so much that it distorts them. don't use
*any* sealant on those gaskets!

I guess you haven't read Tom Wilson's &quot;How To Rebuild your Air Cooled VW&quot;
yet.  It specifies the torque, though I can't remember what it is.  It's
not very much, I think it was 5 lb/ft or less.  He also says to put a very
*light* coating of silicone sealant on the seals, which I have always done.
 This is a great help because it holds the seals in place against the
cooler while you're installing it over the studs.  Makes it much less
likely to clamp it down wrong and have leaks.

&gt;reinstallation is opposite removal, though getting the shroud back in
around the engine support bar can be, well, tricky. putting a jack under
the engine to take the weight off the bar helps a little. 

Be careful doing this - one extra stroke of the jack handle will pull your
motor mounts apart.
