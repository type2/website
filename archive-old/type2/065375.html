Subject: Re: power, timing and distributors

The following is my experience....

I have an early AD engine (1600 twin port) probably a year or two older than my 
van (1973) the timing from the Bentley/Haynes manuals should be 5 degrees ATDC 
(yes 5 ATDC).

When I had my van first I knew little/nothing about timing/tuning so I let my 
Dad, who said he knew what to do, put a vacume gauge on the input manifold and 
advance the ignition to maximize the vacume.... It will come as no suprise to 
most of you that my engine became &quot;seriously cooked&quot; after 50 miles of my next 
long trip.

I learnt four things -
    1.   Dont let my Dad change the timing :-)
    2.   I didn't have a foam seal
    3.   VW engines can be quickly rebuilt (2 heads, 4 pistons/barrels)
    4.   Advancing the ignition creates heat, retarding the ignition reduces
         the heat. Measured indirectly by an oil temperature gauge that I 
         later fitted.

Last year I changed to a 009 distributor. Muir says 7.5 degrees BTDC for 009 on
any engine. Given the range of settings with standard equipment (10BTDC to 
5ATDC) I decided to be cautious.

The 009 went in with the same dynamic timing as the old distributor. Knowning 
that if it was a bit 'flat' and sluggish I could advance it a bit.

How ever everything works fine. I have more power, so can hang on better on 
the hills. So my 009 remains at 5 degrees ATDC.

The unexpected added bonus is that my van now runs with the oil temperature 10 
degrees centigade cooler.

I cann't justify this by computations of the theoretical advance/retard 
position. But postings on this seem to confirm my original gut feeling that 7.5
degrees BTDC would not have been right for my engine.
