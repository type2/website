&gt; Doesn't Raby get relatively HUGE compression ratios in his engines? 9's and 10's?

&gt; Just curious. I'd like to reach the 100 HP mark in my Beetle with a Type IV.

I, years ago had a 1500S motor.  this was VW's high compression motor and
raced with it....12.8:1 compression, needed 104 octane gas, had it dymo'ed
and had 98 HP, and it was clocked at 112MPH, the engine when it ran was a
powerhouse, but it was a nightmare to keep running well.  and if I got
40,000 miles on it (with several top end rebuilds) it was a miracle.
  now remember I raced this thing and was not very kind to the engine, but
it also got way above average maintenence too.

now running a very sedate, 2liter with below spec compression and plan on
it going over 200k (I hope)
