Subject: RE: [T2] Alcohol &amp; bus/shifting problems

All of the various shifting problems I've experienced were fixed by either
clutch cable adjustment or adjusting the stop plate under the shift lever. I
still think my first gear synchro is gone, but due to the low gearing of
first, I usually don't get into that range unless I'm coming to a complete
stop. I rarely want to actually downshift into first.

If you actually have a tranny problem, I would guess it might be in the
hockey-stick in the nose cone since you describe sloppy shifting. I know
there's a bushing or two in there that can wear out. I understand fom
reading that you could service this yourself. These guys have lots of parts
and info:  http://www.longenterprises_dot_com/index.htm

It's common knowledge in the RV world that you can transport open containers
in the refrigerators and cabinets of an RV (a Westy should qualify). This
doesn't extend to the driver's hand though. Passengers can't drink on the
road in most circumstances. However, when I grew up in Idaho, we had no open
container law at all (still true as of 1997).  You could drink and drive;
just not be drunk. This was taken to extremes on the opening day of deer
season...at about dusk, you'd see pickup trucks come down out of the
mountains with: Two rednecks in the cab, two rifles in a rack, a dead deer
strapped to the hood, and a pony keg in the bed, with the hose running
through the cargo window into the cab!

Which brings me to this.  I have replaced every possible thing from the
shifter knob all the way to the transmission and I still can't lose any of
the
sloppiness.  I don't have second gear and can't even smoothly shift from one
gear
to the next when the bus isn't running.  I'm running quite short on options
and patience.  Any ideas what to do next?
