WOO HOO!!! I'M THERE, MAN!!!
how far is that from sydney and melbourne? i have a bus friend in sydney
and a beetle friend in melbourne. i could make a whole VW aussie tour!
hee hee hee. hey, ever hear of something called the &quot;hellbus&quot;? that is my
friend in sydney. i have a pic of it on two wheels going around a corner
on some track. i dont know exactly what he did to it to make it so fast,
but it was quite a popular bus. he sold it and started missing it after a
while, so a year ago, he bought another bus and started recreating it...
HELLBUS2, son of hellbus!

after selling hellbus, he ended up building some other cars. hellfastback
is one i think and i have a sticker on my bug that he sent me for
HELLBUG! that one goes over REAL well here in the middle of the &quot;bible
belt&quot; with ghost rider painted all the way down the side of my bug....
LMAO! see pics of my bug at http://briefcase.yahoo_dot_com/bc/myangelmorgan
and look in the &quot;MY volkswagens&quot; album. all the pics of &quot;sunny&quot; and the
&quot;ghost rider&quot; are all my beetle, sunny. at the bottom are pics  of my
bus... well, the ones i took of it while it was still waiting to run and
ones the PO took before i bought it. did i ever mention how much I LOVE
MY BUS????? looking at those pics reminded me how i felt after i bought
it... so excited to FINALLY have a bus! the pic titled &quot;compact&quot; was my
very first AC VW... actually, very first car i ever made payments on and
bought myself. i love my volksies!

waving with fond memories or my beloved VWs, here and gone,
chris
70 westy (now running... YAY!)
65 euro sunroof beetle (not NOT running... wah!)

 ... Hey Chris, bring your westy to Brisbane and you can camp in winter
