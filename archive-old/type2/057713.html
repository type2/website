Subject: List Problems.

I apologize for the recent list downtime. AZAccess' upstream provider
forced us to change IP numbers with 2 days notice. This was hardly enough
time. Because of the short notice, InterNIC was unable to change DNS
records for my DNS server in time to make the transition smoothly.
Unfortunately, I was not even notified when the change actually took
place. A lot of you remember getting DNS problems late last week. This was
due to my upstream's upstream yanking the IPs without notice. My old IP
addresses were not being routed 4 days before I was notified they
weren't. However, there is good news. My upstream provider now OWNS its
new IP numbers, so....I'll never have to renumber again.

Other good news: 

The type2 list server and web server are slated to be upgraded to Sun
Sparcs. This should occur within the next 6 weeks. This will improve
performance vastly over what we are currently experiencing. 

Once again, I do apologize for the downtime.
