&gt;I lost part of the right side of the gas pedal at the bottom, it falls

There is a hinge welded to the floor and a spring and pin go through the hinge. A c-clip holds the pedal to the rod that connects to the accelerator cable.

There are two styles of pins: 68-75 are shorter.

Also the hinges are slightly different. The 68-75 hinge has no holes and has more bends.

I have a 78 bus and didn't find the right parts at BusDepot. CIP1 seems to have the correct hinge C27-211-721-613, as well as both 68-75 and 76-79 pedals to choose front.

I'm not sure of a source for the correct pin but I'm sure you can use what you have now. The return spring comes in two flavours: 73-75 and 76-79 to match the middle part of the pin.
