Subject: Broken valve spring  Some questions
Message-ID: &lt;7ldi2t$cho3_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Story: today on my way home there was a rattling sound from left side of engine. Pulled head cover. Found a broken valve spring.
Question: is it by any means possible to replace this spring without pulling the engine ?? The engine was out just 600 Km ago. I would be very glad if I don't have to pull it again.
Question 2: is it possible to tighten the upper row of head nut without pulling the engine ?
Question 3:is it possible that I by any mistake when I had the engine out last time have caused this broken valve spring ? ( had the head of ).

Any help would be appreciated
