If your timing light doesn't have a scale it is probably a standard timing
light that just flashes at the same time the spark plug fires.  To avoid
confusion with timing notches find the one that is 0 degrees TDC by getting
your engine at 0 degrees TDC by observing when your distributor rotor is
pointing to the #1 spark plug wire and then looking at your pulley and see
which notch is lined up with the crank case split.  Mark this notch as 0
degrees TDC.  With a 009 distributor you need 28-32 degrees total advance at
around 2500-3000 RPM (it stops advancing somewhere in that range).  So make
a mark on your pulley 28-32 degrees, or 43mm on a stock pulley, to the right
of the 0 degrees TDC just found.  Now as your wife revs the engine up shine
the timing light on the pulley and line the 28-32 degree mark up with the
crank case split.  You can rev the engine yourself by pulling on the
throttle arm of the carburator, but I encourage teamwork.

The vacuum holes on my carb are plugged up with little rubber plugs.
Anything would work I suppose, just make sure it doesn't get sucked into the
carb.  You'll need to plug all the holes, except for the one the air filter
sits on!

Good luck,

&gt;the van.  I have a timing gun but it does not have a
&gt;scale.  I marked the middle of the 3 notches on the
&gt;pully, I believe this to be approx. 8degrees.  How do
&gt;I test for total advance.  Do I have my wife rev the
&gt;engine while I watch the light.  Will the light now
&gt;blink at another 16 or so degrees off to the right for
&gt;a total of around 32degrees.  Then I will check the
