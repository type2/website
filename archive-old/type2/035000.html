Subject: BBB IV and kids

I was planning on attending my first &quot;bus event&quot; by myself. (My wife had 
graciously agreed to give me a &quot;week-end&quot; off, since she is often gone on 
weekends with work.)  However, she has been called off to work most of 
Saturday, and it is not cost effective to pay a sitter.  My choices are then 
to stay in Vegas or attend with my girls.

I have seen on the posters for Buses by the Bridge IV that there are things 
for the kids to do.  I was wondering if bringing my daughters (4 1/2, 3, and 6 
1/2 mos) is a good idea, or if I should wait for another event to attend solo.

Secondly, my 6 1/2 month old still isn't sleeping through the night yet, so if 
we come, should I request a site in the back 40?

Any veteran advice will be much appreciated.
