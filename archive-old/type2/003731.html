Hi Robert and any other UK Listees

This message was taken from Type 2 owners website

OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
Despite the shortage of fuel in the UK, VANFEST is going ahead.

At this time no traders have cancelled and all of the entertainmenters are
coming.

If you have sufficient petrol to get to Malvern, but there is still a
shortage on Sunday/Monday then the showground will set aside an area for
&quot;Petrol Refugees&quot; to remain until the situation eases.

It's &quot;business as usual&quot; at VANFEST 2000. See you there.

Vanfest and VW Type 2 Owners Club Committees. 12 September 2000

&gt; UK listees ( I know there are some), as we have no fuel available on a
&gt; nationwide basis, does anyone know about VANFEST exhibitor attendances
this
&gt; weekend?
&gt; Haven't tried just Kampers web site, but it seems many won't be going as
no
&gt; petrol/diesel available.  We are trying to decide if it's worth the trip
if
&gt; no stall holders will be there.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry about this US listees, but you don't know how lucky you are!  Thanks
&gt; for your tolerance of this parochial enquiry.
&gt;
&gt;                             Regards, Robert.
