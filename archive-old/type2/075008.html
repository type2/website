Subject: Re: [T2] starter needed, also interchange


From: &lt;Westyfalia_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

&gt; I need a starter for a 76 Non Pop westy.  A used one would be ok as I don't
&gt; think the old one is completely shot.  But the inspection is coming up on it
&gt; and I need a starter to get it over to the shop to do the bearings and
&gt; windshield etc....  As well if you all could verify the years that a starter
&gt; could come from I would look in the yards in the mean time.......

It does not matter if it is a non-pop top or a pop top......
What matters is:
What engine do you have?
What transmission do you have?

If it is a 2.0L with a 4 speed, it uses a 76-83 starter. You can spot it by the
starter drive. The drive will have a blank section 1/2&quot; long between the gear
teeth and the Sprague clutch.
[the teeth are farther out]
If it is a 1600 or a 1.8L with a 4 speed, it uses the same starter as a bug. The
teeth on the stater drive will be next to the Sprague clutch. No space.
If it is a 2.0L with an auto trans, it uses a self-supporting starter. This
self-supporting starter can be used on 1600's, 1.7's, and 1.8's with a 4 speed
but cannot be used on a 76 and up 2.0L 4 speed. It will not reach the teeth on
the flywheel.
