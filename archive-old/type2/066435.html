Fig,

ZF limited Slip for T1, 2, 3 swingaxle tranny.

I just called ZF The Netherlands, and guess what, the guy thinks
they might still be available NEW! I suspect they are pretty expensive
if they are available. I'll let you know He's faxing/sending me some 
details and will call me back on it. He asked me the locking percentage 
i needed, i said dono, he suggested 40% would be a good starting point.

I'm CCing to the list as it might be of interest to others as well.

More later,

Brian.
