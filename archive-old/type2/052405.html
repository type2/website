Subject: [T2] 77 bus idling prob

Hi everyone. my bus is still idling weird, mainly when it's
cold. if you start her up, it's almost like a harley,
loping, then if you give her a little gas she rev's but
still in a loping sort of manner. very shaky on the body of
the bus, you can watch it shake. and if you let off the gas
then she'll just die right away. so i have to set the choke
on almost full blast to keep it idling while i let her warm
up.  once she's somewhat warm it will come out of harley
wannabe stage and idle smooth, but you have to stay with her
on the gas to keep her going, otherwise she will fade from a
strong idle and die slowly. once i get down the road a mile
or so, i can stop and she will idle no problem. it's a 1600
dp (yes, in a '77) with stock everything but a petronix and
header. i've tried all the manifold clamps and manifold ends
on the head. checked the solenoid, it's tight. the carb i
know is good, 'cause i took it off my good running bug.
driving me absolutely insane, but i bet with my luck it's
just something simple waiting for my dumb-a_at_# to find it.
thank you for the replys last time i posted. thanks-mark.
