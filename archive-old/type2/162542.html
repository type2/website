&gt; &gt;that's the problem, No spark of any kind.!!!  engine was running', stopped
&gt; &gt;power still to coil, plenty of fuel, but no spark
&gt;
&gt; Then the quickest way forward is to swap out the coil. If you don't have spare you can check it with an ohm meter.

swap out coil and/or the points or both.  problem is that when I put the
points in earlier but not swap the coil, engine wouldn't start, put
pertronix back it ran for a bit, need to swap both I think to get started
then test em one at a time...

thanks for the help

Bob
