Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder Head Paint

I don't disagree about the place of painted engines. In my world, they
share list location with painted garage floors.

However, I've inferred from my reading there may be a longevity value 
to painting the cylinders only on a T4 engine. As I initially mentioned, 
Mr. Hoover recommends painting the cylinders and the photo on the cover 
of the Wilson shows painted cylinders.  I've no plans to paint the case 
or the heads. I will repaint the tin, but more as a rust inhibitor than 
for dashing good looks. 

If someone has experience as to whether the paint has helped with 
longevity and/or coolin or not, I'd appreciate the information/anecdote. 
I'd also love to know what paint has or has not worked on your cylinders.
