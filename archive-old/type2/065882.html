Subject: ALTERNATOR gone (was: Battery Light On!)

hey now,

went to advance auto today and had them test the alternator out. it is bad.
voltage regulator good. so tommorrow i get to learn how to put one in. i'm
going to do it at my friend sean's shop. from what i've been told shouldn't be
too hard...will be nice to have a mechanic looking over my shoulder though! :-)
