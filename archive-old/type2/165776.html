Subject: Re: [T2] 15 inch wheels tire on westy

Bonjour Michel,

The best VW bus tire reference on the internet right now is Larry
Chase's site. It's original focus is on the vanagon, but any tire
that is suitable for a vanagon is also suitable for a baywindow. And
since there were vanagons that came from the factory with 15&quot; and 16&quot;
rims, you will also find reviews of those sizes on the page as well.

Happy Trails,
