Rachel and All,

The light is a warning light for your brake system....if it comes on
while driving....bad news. If it no longer lights up when you push it,
it's probably the bulb and needs to be replaced. This info comes from
my owners manual, by the way;-)

&gt; Who knows;
&gt; 		Below the heater controls on Ramona's dash, there is a red plastic
round
&gt; button-esque light that, when depressed, goes lit red. There is a
&quot;B&quot; in the
&gt; center etched in white.
&gt; 		Been there forever, and I've never known its use. We've always
used it as
&gt; the miscellaneous James Bond button; fire bombs, rear-end oil spray
(like
&gt; 'Mona needs a button pushed to do that ;), and, her favorite, the
cloaking
&gt; device initiator.
&gt; 		Stranger, it always used to illuminate when pushed, even with no
key on, but
&gt; since we've been tinkering around the past few months in our
(successful)
&gt; effort to revive our hero-ess, the light no longer lights...so,
that's what
&gt; really got me thinking about throwing out this post to you all.
&gt; 		Since we are not planning any future trips through Utah, the
cloaking device
&gt; and lack thereof, is not a necessity, but we're very curious, and
figure you
&gt; can help.
&gt; Many Thanks
&gt; Rachel &amp; Ramona
