Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning the oil breather hose

Yes, when cold and thermostat is indeed collapsed (shortened), you pull 
the flap closed (downwards where the clamp is) and then tighten the 
clamp in that position.  If the thermostat has failed (relaxed, ie, 
longer) and you do this, it will NEVER loosed the flap pull and you will 
overheat when warm.

  So, I recently hooked my thermostat back up while the alternator was 
out and
  I had to push the arm all the way forward for enough of the cable to grab
  when tightening down on it.  Is this not the correct method for hooking up
  the cable?  I have not tested after the engine is warm since I have 
not had
  a chance to deal with the alternator cooling boot issue yet. I'm perusing
  the archives at this time but no luck so far.
