Subject: RE: [T2] Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

Let us know if that stuff works or not. 

FYI - you can get it from campingworld_dot_com for $8.99 + shipping. 

I know, support your bus parts suppliers and all, but its not really a
bus specific item, GoWesty just happens to be pushing it along with the
rest of their stuff.

Go Westy ****

The only thing I ordered from this vendor was a bottle of miracle stuff 
to rejuvinate my pop-up top.  Don't know if it will really work as 
claimed, but I thought it would be worth a try, considering the cost 
and effort of properly refinishing the top.  Anyway, I used their 
online ordering system, which charged $8.95 for shipping a 16 oz bottle 
of stuff which cost $12.95.  I thought this was overcharging on 
shipping, and I sent Go Westy an email telling them so.  They responded 
within an hour with a nice email, telling me they would just mail it 
Priority for $5.95.  Still more than actual postage, but I did 
appreciate their attitude.

By the close of business yesterday, Go Westy had already sent me an 
email to tell me that my order had been shipped!
