&gt; It seems the driver fed a 1/2 can of something like BG 44 thru their brake
&gt; vacuum hose to the intake manifold while the engine was idling, and then
&gt; poured the rest in the tank.

It's an old-timer's trick to pour just about any liquid down the carb with
the engine running to clean carbon out of the cylinders.  Water works just
fine and doesn't make as bad a cloud of smoke as diesel oil or Rislone
(Muir's suggested liquids)

The idea is that the impact and thermal shock of the droplets rattling
around in the cylinder will break the loose carbon free.  Years ago I
tried it on a Datsun that was dieseling and it did solve the problem for a
while.

Caution:  If you do decide to do this, change the oil right after you
finish.  Whatever liquid you pour in will find its way past the rings and
contaminate the oil.
