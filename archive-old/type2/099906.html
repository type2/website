Subject: R: [T2] Accessory Vespa for Bus

Well, beside my '76 bus I have a 125cc vespa (red, of course!) which is
my daily scooter - I can tell you this much: here in Italy an old Vespa
is cheap (find it on ebay italy), really cheap! And they don't suck much
gas either, for their age. My 125 goes easily up to 110 Kph and is 20
years old. I do believe though that in the US a Vespa is a lot harder to
find, but:

They are damn heavy (mine is 200 Kg almost)
They drink more and have less speed than new ones
They get stolen if in good condition (I don't sleep at night when mine
is locked outside here in Milan-city)

My vespa hardly fits on the bus... and I must take out the seats, also!

I would go for a lighter 50cc unit if I were you

Beside that I *love* and *self-cheap-repair* my Vespa as much as my bus
!
