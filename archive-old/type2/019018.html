Hi Folks,

Some health problems have come up for me, priorities have changed, and
I'm going to have to move some projects. 

I would like to sell a low mileage 2000 T4 Engine, complete with 091
Trans, all fuel injection parts &amp; pieces and complete to the rear
wheels, including axles with brand new Lobro CV's. The engine has 135
lbs on all cylinders and runs extremely well.

I just finished stripping this engine to the long block, completely
cleaning, sandblasting, repainting and detailing, including new fuel
lines and all gaskets and new engine seal. It is ready to install and
run today.

The fuel injection is late '78 and includes all components, hoses, etc.

I'm asking $750.00 and will palletize and ship freight collect. I would
prefer to not break this up.

Not ready to leave the list yet and also have some other bus and bug
stuff to sell. If you need something, pmail and we'll discuss.

Thanks,

Michael Lewis
Seattle
