&gt;How do you clean the non-disposable air filter?  Would you use paint thinner
&gt;or something to get all of the debris out of it?   I know this must seem
&gt;like a stupid question, but I don't want to inflict any damage on myself,
&gt;vehicle, or nearby observers!

If it is an oil bath style (should it be in '74, when did they switch?) you
can clean it according to my instrcutions in the library on www.type2_dot_com.

It will amaze you what the hell comes out of the fiber section of an oil
bath air cleaner.  But the horse hair or whatever it is will gleam like new
if you are persistent.

If you have some sort of gauze filter (on a Weber say) wash and oil.
