Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filler hose

Hi folks

The hose was aroiund the 2 inch mark, I just put it on (deparate to get on
with it) its the one that goes from the metal filler pipe to the tank
itself, it has a bend in it, about 75 degrees near the end.
It seems to be made of a softer rubber than my original, but that might have
gone hard.  Its thicker walled (but still fits the stock clips) and does not
seem to have any of the reinforcing &quot;string&quot; through it.  It was clearly
marked Fuel hose - made in the UK.

The supplier (with whom I have no connection etc) was VW Heritage in the UK,
cost was a fairly steep UKP40, but I was tired of fiddling with the old one.
I have just checked an online converter and thats about  CDN95 or USD73,
plus shipping.

Its not on the website at www.vwheritage_dot_com but is at the bottom of their
ad in the latest Camper and Comercial (realy bad picture).

I have Emailed them and asked for a price to ship to North Ameriaca and will
report back with details. I will also take some photos if I can get a
Digicam at the weekend.

John
