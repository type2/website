Subject: Re: Tool question

&gt;Ok, [snip] my birthday is coming up, so I have a couple of tool
&gt;questions for the list
[snip]

Quality tools are an indescribable joy, but having ENOUGH tools is a 
higher priority for me. If your daddy's rich, ask for Snap-On or SK 
tools. If your daddy's poor, ask for a starter set like this:

I've found that my primo tools don't always outlast the cheapcrap. 
You need a lot of sockets, end wrenches, and screwdrivers. I'd go 
basic cheapy and upgrade as they get fubar.

Don't skimp on stuff like torque wrenches and don't get anything from 
Harbor Freight with the &quot;Chicago Electric&quot; brand.

You need deep wall sockets for all kinds of stuff under your buss.

Six point sockets take more torque with less likelihood of rounding. 
If any nuts or bolts have been rounded or boogered or just aren't 
quite spec, you'll get a better fit with a 12 point. (I'd get the 12s 
first and add the 6 later.)

Frankly I tend to shop Craftsman tools, largely because you can find 
a Sears just about anywhere and when a tool craps out, you just walk 
in and get a new one, no questions asked.
