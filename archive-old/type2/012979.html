I've noticed in past tear downs that the VW original cylinder heads on my
2000cc have depressions in the surface where the gasket sits on top of
the cylinder. These depressions are fairly deep and it doesn't appear
that a standard cylinder head gasket (after they are compressed) will
bring the compression surface to the same height as the AMC heads
mentioned below.

In retrospect the AMC cylinder heads are raised at the point that they
contact the top of the cylinder (these heads do not use gaskets).

Just out of curiosity I took a spring-loaded center punch and actuated it
on non-critical area of each head, I noticed that the VW OEM head was
considerably softer than the AMC. Not a very good brinel test but
sufficient to tell me that there was a definite difference in the base
material hardness.

The question I have is this: 
Is there some type of material like Plasti-Gauge that can be used on the
top of the piston or outer raised portion to set up cylinder head spacing
and achieve balanced (or very close) compression?
