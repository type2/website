Fellow listees,       I am.....'er was......employed.  I'm currently
unemployed, seeking employment but not knowing what the heck I want to do
with the remainder of my life.  Think I'd just like to spend it driving
around the country in my ' 77 bus, but know thats not feasible.  I was a
local city parks superintendent, followed by 10 or so years working in
fabrication, and finally the CAD-CAM end of the production of raw printed
circuit boards.  Currently I spend a lot of time at home, reading the
list, working under my bus and other vehicles, and maintaining 3 homes
and a lot of cattle acreage( fences, gates, weeds, calves, etc.).  Guess
I'm a &quot;property manager&quot; of sorts...
          On a Type 2 related question,  I have thought of purchasing the
front and/or rear bumper guards for my bus, but have wondered if they're
worth the effort?  Do those of you who have them swear by them ( have
they spared your bumper from dings on occasion) or are they more for
appearance, which would be fine too.  I've always wondered if there is a
proper placement for them to achieve the best results from approaching
impending doom...  Any thoughts on this to help me decide?
