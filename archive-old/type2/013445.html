Subject: Re: Driving Time to Guadalajara

Hey Mike -
I'm not sure on exact driving time from AZ to Guadalajara, but I can give
you sort of a ballpark.  I know from experience that it's about a 22-hour
drive from Tijuana, Baja California, down the peninsula to La Paz.  I also
know that the drive from Mazatlan (SE across the Sea of Cortez on the
mainland) down to Puerto Vallarta is around 5 hours on the faster,
straighter toll road -- and a couple of hours more on the free road. 
Guadalajara is &gt;&gt;roughly&lt;&lt; adjacent to PV in terms of southbound distance,
as they are in the same state of Jalisco.  Barring unforeseen
circumstances, red tape, mountain traffic jams and that sort of thing, I
would give yourself at least a full 2 days for the drive (including time to
enjoy the beauty of the land).  However, I've never done the actual route
you're doing so this is no better than a guesstimate.  The other biggest
piece of advice I can give is DO NOT (repeat, repeat) drive anywhere in
Mexico without Mexican automobile insurance.  It is your Get Out Of Jail
Free Card if you get into a car accident down there.  This is a total must
- you can easily get it at the border.  Also, (1) Don't drive at night - it
can be very hazardous, especially to your bus if it happens to encounter a
cow sleeping in the middle of the road on a curve; and (2) Take as many
spare parts (belts, points, plugs, tire, clutch cable, accelerator cable,
oil chg stuff, spare fuel line, etc.) as you can think of and fit in.
