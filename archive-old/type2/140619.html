Subject: Re: [T2] 68 parts

Mark asked:


 Hey guys  Is there any differences on the bumpers and doors on a 68 bus
 compared to say a 70 bus.  thanks     Mark Dearing

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bumpers are the same.

TRUE 68 doors are one-year-only:

They use pushbutton outer handles ala 67 but the paddle is a different length. Lever action started in 69.

They use one-year-only latch assemblies. The lock knob is on top of the
window sill. 69 to around 74? had the lock knob with the inner handle.

The 68 door resembles the 75? and up door with the lock knob on the sill but from 70 and up flow thru
vemtilation appeared. The later door has slots in the front edge to allow air to enter. 68-69 doors did not.

In mid 76, the hinges reversed. Up to 2x6 2126 631 has Allen bolts. From 2x6 2126 632 has 13mm headed bolts.
You cannot swap them because of the thread position.


Other 68 only differences:
The rear view mirror is held on by 2 screws. The break-away feature started in 69.
The early 68's used the 9 pin flasher from 67.
The upper, lower, and connecting pipe on the 68 were one-year-only. The pipe was metal, plastic started in 69.
The wiper shafts and arms are 68 only. The threaded nut started in 69.
68 did not have a gas tank panel. That started in 69.

This is just off the top of my head.....
