Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Is the end near? Few VW buses seen at premier
  hippie  gathering!

Todd,

Either you were too young to be there or ya slept since then....&lt;grin&gt;

1967(the start of the movement...at least in Texas)...went to my first 
love-in at the local park in Dallas...LOL!!!..and I was nowhere near 20 
either!

I had a 1966 vw bug too then   Wasn't till later hippiedom that I was 
able to afford a bus....my first was a 67 split with a bad engine.

Lordy I miss those days...everyone friendly(well, except for in 
Chicago)...no terrorists yet...and all those other unmentionables!

Cheers, dave

 But as far as lack of hippies go...  most of them 
were in their early 20s in the 60s... that was 40 years ago! 
hahah.... so the majority of them are probably all in nursing homes.  ; )
