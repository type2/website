&gt; Hmmm... Robert White's e-mail address is on that site - he's the campground
&gt; host, along with his family.  Maybe we should send him a note?  Tell him
&gt; he's giving Mayberry a bad name?

It would do more harm to a this business if this incident is reported to the Better Business Buruee (pardon my spelllling!)
and State Attourny General.  Both keep track of these things and go after the &quot;repeat offenders&quot;
Then eventuelly have to answer to the long arm of the law, not to mention a drop in business!

But slamming then with letters might just piss'em off...better to get thm in the pocket book!!!

But I won't be camping there!
