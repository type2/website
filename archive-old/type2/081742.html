&gt;&gt;anyone know what thread and pitch the oil pressure sender hole is
&gt;&gt;on a type 1 case?
&gt;
&gt;It's a tapered thread.  I was pretty sure it was a metric thread,
&gt;but a couple of posts in the type2 archive claim it is a 1/8&quot; NPT
&gt;(National Pipe Taper) thread.

NPT = National Pipe Thread-( they list both taper and straight threads ).

&gt;Apparently the sender on a type 4 case and the oil-cooler mounted
&gt;sender on a type 3 use regular square threads and a crush washer
&gt;for sealing.

You can't put square threads in a round hole. (*~*)
Anybody want to venture a guess why there are so many leaks
in the oil sender location for both type 1 and type 4 engines ?  8^).
