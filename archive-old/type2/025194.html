So now I am getting frustrated.  It appears that PO has removed various components associated with the CA emissions setup (EGR line crimped, idle stabilizer removed, some random wiring, etc...)  I know that CA emissions guidelines are much stricter than federal, but what is the difference under the hatch?  Can I get by without the idle stabilizer?  I know in AZ pretty much anything can pass emissions as long as petroleum doen't actually blow out the pipe on the pants of the inspector, but will it hurt performance if it is bypassed?  what are the actual differences in the CA and federal systems?
Also, it seems that the bus is having problems warming up. How can I test the cold-start valve and the thermo-time switch?  It starts up fine, seems to &quot;choke up&quot;, then dies...once it is warmed up runs fine..  My understanding is that this would indicate that the cold-start valve is working, but beyond that, I'm lost.  Any help or other suggestions greatly appreciated, as always.
Thanks
Mike Edwards
