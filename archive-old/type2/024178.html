Al...

mmm, well..... it runs..... the only thing connected to the #1 (-) side of 
the coil, besides the (-) lead from the Compufire module, is the ground side 
of the relay.... the 12V power for the fuel pump comes from the battery... 

Maybe I missed something... but all I needed was a source of power that would 
be on only when the engine was running, hence the take-off from the blue 
wire.....  Would it be better to ground the relay to the chassis?  That would 
give (+) from the blue wire, then (-) to the chassis... when the engine 
starts running, then the relay would close and the 12V would flow from the 
battery to the pump.... guess I will have to try.

Connecting to the (-) of the coil maybe why my timing light is now an almost 
steady flicker.... it strobes, but at an extreemely high speed, not the 
pulses I expected for the #1 cylinder....  maybe some more testing, hope I 
haven't ruined anything.....

the manual pump would certianly have been easier on the noggin.....
