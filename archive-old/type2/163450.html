&gt; IIRC, several of you fellow list members are in the education field.  I did
&gt; a
&gt; search for a few possible books to buy; I get the feeling these are
&gt; textbooks. 
&gt; Possibly if I wait a year or two they would be remaindered -- i.e.,
&gt; available
&gt; cheaply.  But if I want one now, I am looking at 40-60 bucks minimum.  Any
&gt; help
&gt; and/or recomms will be appreciated.  Thanks and have a great day!!
