Subject: Baja Bus update

Hi All,

Well it's Friday again down here in Australia and I've just added a new
story to my Baja Bus site, a great tale of taking your Bus offroad and
having some campfire side fun.  Check it out at http://www.baja_dot_com/kombi I
also added an update not long ago to my Wild VW's site at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/motorcity/garage/1811 with pics of a 2.3lt inline
5cyl Audi motor in a Vanagon.

Cheers
Steve
