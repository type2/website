#2 Sounds like one of those plastic pieces that coil up the seatbelt. And #1
the 2 black pieces sound like an in-line fuse holder that many radios come
with.
-Wade



&gt;1) a piece of white plastic about 2 1/2&quot; long that is round (like a pencil)
&gt;but hollow inside.
&gt;it says, &quot;wind 8 times&quot; on it.
&gt;
&gt;2) two black round pieces of plastic that fit together.  when i push them
&gt;together and turn, they come apart and there is a red fuse on the inside of
&gt;one piece.

&gt;sorry about the crappy description!  does anyone have any idea what i would
&gt;&quot;wind eight times&quot; on my 75 westy?
