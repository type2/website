Hiya Todd,

Ok, break out the deutschmarks, the stamps, and address your snailmail to:

Stiftung Automuseum Volkswagen
Frau Neefe
Dieselstrasse 35
38436 Wolfsburg
Germany

Send your VIN (and your engine serial number if you want, but they really 
won't need that) and 20DM (about $11US at today's rate of exchange).

Good luck to you,

Mike
