Oo Baby, oo baby, can I, can I, may I, may I, please, please?
                 NO, you just got a new toy.
Oh yeah, I forgot, I just got a second '80 Westi to play with.
But it's not fair, it's not fair, this one runs! My new one 
doesn't want to play just yet, this one does.  
                 *&amp;(*&amp;&quot;+$# NO.
Oh well, that 210 mile haul was tough enough,
 I don't want to think about a 2500 mile haul.
