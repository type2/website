&lt;&lt; Are the Yokohama's a slightly better choice than the Continentals? &gt;&gt;

Not sure about a direct comparison,  but I have a set Yokohoma Y356 185 R 14 
(D load rating) on my 79 westfalia and I have found them to run smooth and 
relatively quiet on the highway and they have done great in the rain around 
Portland last winter.  They easily accomodate the recommended 44 psi rear 
tire inflation. 

The big test was in february when I traveled Route 26 through the Coastal 
Range to a &quot;wet westies&quot; beach campout.  The highway was a mixture of packed 
snow, several inches of fresh snow and solid ice and I never lost traction.  
I passed numerous other people pulled over and chaining up, two cars in the 
ditch and a jacknifed semi-truck.

needless to say, I'm quite pleased with them!  I followed a vanagon syncro 
home the next day in conditions almost as bad.  Though he had mud and snow 
rated tires, I kept up just fine.

Mine cost $361 mounted with new stems, lifetime balance, rotate, and flat 
repair.  At 7000 miles they show little to no wear.
