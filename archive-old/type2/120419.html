Subject: RE: voltage regulator toasted UPDATE

The fun continues...
While tearing out the old VR, I noticed the old battery cables were
pretty foul, so I replaced them. I replaced the battery while I was
there, popped it into one of them Marine boxes to keep it dry (whoever
posted that last week, great idea). I got a Bosch VR from the FLAP.
When all was connected, I checked the GEN light, and it was glowing...
glaring at me... mocking me. Ok, maybe not mocking, but it lit up, and
that's bad and got me lit up and that's bad. So, did I toast another
VR? I never put in a key, nor fired up the engine, just hooked up the
electricals.
Now, I've pulled the alternator (a rebuilt Bosch), with a plan to have
it tested. If there's a listee out there in the greater Portland Area
that has a shop they trust for these types of tests, please share.
While the ALT is out, I have access to both ends of the 3 wires that go
from the ALT to the VR. I'll be testing these for resistance (breakage)
tomorrow evening. Assuming the wires are clear, and the ALT tests fine,
could all of this be caused by the last wire - the one heading to the
GEN light, a bad ground in the VR contact with the firewall or am I
completely missing something?
Right about now someone will mention that I should have performed all
of these tests before ever installing the new VR in the first place.
Well, life is a learning opportunty. Any help would be warmly welcomed.
I really appreciate all of the feedback I've gotten thus far. 
Thanks--
