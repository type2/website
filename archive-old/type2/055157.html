Subject: Re: colder plugs

performance is identical. Colder plugs should be used on engines (or
applications) that run hotter, to help prevent pre-ignition.

&quot;heat range&quot; of a spark plug really refers to how well (or not) the plug
electrode's heat gets transferred to the head (where it can be passed to the
cooling system).

I would only use a colder plug on a FI engine, OR if you have a CDI to keep
the plug from fouling.

I also feel that NGK makes a much better plug, for what that's worth.
