Subject: Broken thermostat wire

Hi All, 

Whilst repacking the CV joints and installing new boots, I realized that
the thermostat wire that controls the flaps was broken.  '77 bus runs
well, and cool.  Most of my driving is short jaunts, so there's times
the oil temp barely gets to 140 deg.  Head temp comes up to about
300-350 without a problem, but the oil takes *forever* to get up to
temp.  

The flaps are in the &quot;warm running&quot; position, and I do notice a bit of
missing under acceleration when the motor is still cold, but once she
warms up a bit, she runs like a top.  

Am I condemning my motor to a slow death by not having the thermostat
flaps hooked up?

Thanks!

Shad H.
