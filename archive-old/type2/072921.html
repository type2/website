Subject: Re: dash lights

Wonky dash lights are caused by the light switch's rheostat wire breaking
(a little curly wire in a ceramic housing with one end connected to power -
a wiper rides this to pick off current; the further along the wire from the
current source, the more resistance, the dimmer the lights).
When the wire breaks, you can only get as bright as the unbroken length
lets you. If all this makes sense.
Warning: replace the switch as soon as practical; the broken wire can
spring out, short to the dash and casue a fire. Having said that, mine has
been this way for 6 months, coz I have a 70, and the replacement switches
available are all wrong for my bus.
