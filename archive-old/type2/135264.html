Subject: Propane fuel conversion on 1977?

Hi Volks,
I'm having problems locating a service that can convert my 77 to an 
alternative fuel such as Propane. Ideally, I'd like a hydrogen cell, but 
doubt I can get there from here.

Anyway, the problem I'm having is that the people who can convert my 77 
said they can't as its air-cooled; they need hot water to run an 
expansion tank to convert the fuel from one form to another. I'll not 
rip out my new engine to put in a rust monster. Any ideas would be 
welcome.
Timothy in Phoenix.
