This weekend I was driving my 73 Westy home from a friend's house.  Turned
the corner about 1/2 mile from home and the oil light came on.  I looked
down at my nifty VDO oil pressure gauge and it was showing 0 also.  Not a
little low, just plain ZERO!  So I immediately turned off the key and
coasted to a stop.  Called my wife and had her come with the tow rope and
take me and the bus home.

OK, so I'm thinking, &quot;What on earth could cause a perfectly healthy engine
to all of a sudden show 0 oil pressure?&quot;.  I checked the oil and the
dipstick read full.  Finally concluded that there's only 2 possibilities:
Either the tang broke off my 25 year old oil pump (likely?) or I had a
catastrophic failure on the oil pressure sending unit itself (seemed
unlikely since its been working perfectly for 8 months/10k miles).  It
almost couldn't be the wiring since the dummy light wire is part of the
original harness and the gauge uses a new wire.

Luckily for me, the first thing I did is pull the sender unit off the rubber
hose that attaches it to the case and there, right before my eyes was the
culprit!  A little string of RTV Red (I used it to help seal the sender to
the tube) was hanging right over the end of the sender, covering the
plunger.  Cleaned it up and all was well.  Sure am glad that hadn't happened
on my 3000 mile trip to Jerome last fall.

Moral of the story?  Be careful when using gasket sealer - a little is a
good thing, a lot can lead to big troubles.
