Subject: Re: [T2] TWO SENSORS ON TRANNY

Todd,

Take it out and look at it.  Does it look like the other one?

Hook up a VOM to the other sensor and run thru the gears....see if 
anything happens in a particular gear....do you get continuity in a 
certain gear?

I can't imagine it having anything to do with a tach as the location
you are talking about only has gear shifting  mechanisms in it..IIRC

Can you take a picture?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; 
&gt; 	I wasn't able to find anyone that knew what the second sensor on my
&gt; transmission was. The two sensors I am talking about are the ones located at
&gt; the very front of the transmission. This would be, at the forward most part
&gt; of the transmission when looking at the tranny from under the bus. (closest
&gt; to the front of the bus on the transmission). 
&gt; With the responses I received, I learned that the one closest to the
&gt; passenger side was the reverse light switch. That happens to be the only one
&gt; that's connected right now. The OTHER sensor doesn't seem to have any wires
&gt; connected to it. It's a two pronged sensor. Could this be for the tachometer
&gt; or something?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Help! Thanks,
&gt;
