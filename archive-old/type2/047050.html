&gt; I would also STRONGLY suggest you head down to the local hardward store and

&gt; This will give you the leverage you need to remove an overtorqed bolt.

I bought a 3/4&quot; slide bar at a pawn shop in GA that I went to with Charlie
F (6.00) I stopped carrying the cheater pipe because you can get so much
leverage by standing on the end of the breaker no axle nut or lug bolt has
been able to resist. stand on the end of the breaker and hold the drip
rail, bounce a bit if need be thats some serious torque.
