Subject: Re: [T2] microbus news

The concept bus looks very nice, but still can't persuade me that 
spending the money on a brand new brazilian air cooled bus (plus the 
modifications to make it UK legal) wouldn't be a better use of the cash. 
If the estimates are true, I could buy 2! Which brings me to my question 
- how is vehicle identity managed in the US? What I mean is, here there 
is a set of rules about what makes a car a car. For example, if you take 
the front axle from an existing car and build a chassis/kit car around 
it, you can keep the registration/identity/number plate of the vehicle 
that the axle came from. It makes sense really - I know for a fact my 73 
westy is no more than 50% original, what with new engines, new panels 
etc. Getting philosophical, our own bodies renew themselves cell by cell 
over the course of a few months, so do we need new passports every six 
months? Obviously not.

Anyway. Would it be legal to import a brazilian bus, remove a few key 
parts and replace them with the parts from an old bus (would have to be 
73 or later), and hey presto, a new bus, but with old plates (and smog 
exemption etc)? All you've done really is replace lots of parts 
simulateously. I realise that if you sold the bus, you would have 
trouble getting your investment back, but for someone who wants to keep 
their VW forever...
