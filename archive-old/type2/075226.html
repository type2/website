Subject: Re: [T2] seats question

Also, while I'm at it, I may look for better front seats.  Any ideas?

Rob &amp; The List,
      I too, was in search of a better (more comfortable) seat for my =
Westy. I did not want to trash the seat track, however, so as to be able =
to reinstall the original seat. I had a driver side seat from a parts =
bus that was trashed, and a very nice gray velour seat from, of all =
things, a Fiat. I removed the bottom track of  the Westy  seat and =
bolted it to the bottom of the Fiat seat, so it now fits on the bus seat =
track, and I can switch back to the original in just a few minutes. The =
Fiat seat is very comfortable, even has a speaker in the headrest I may =
hook up someday!    Good luck,  Jeff
