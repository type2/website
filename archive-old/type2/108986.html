Subject: RE: [T2] 78 2.0 and Oil

BTW, the froth itself probably doesn't hurt anything, but the fact that
water is present means rust and acid formation could occur.

This is usually caused by water in the oil...maybe your radiator is leaking
into the oil sump lol

Water gets into air-cooled oil from humidity in the air. This occurs
normally, but can be aggravated by a missing o-ring on your oil filler cap.
Once the water gets in the oil, it doesn't stay very long since oil temps at
or above 180* will drive the water off.

Normal driving will get the oil warm enough, but if you usually only drive a
few miles at a time, it might never warm up. My daily commute of 7-8 miles
barely gets my oil temps up, and that's only cuz I climb a huge hill on the
way. And I live in S. California.

The other thing that can keep the oil from warming up is missing
thermostat/cooling flaps. This would allow too much cooling air during the
first few miles. If you live somewhere really cold, it might never warm up.
