&gt;I'm not talking about basic maintenance.

&gt;Hmmm... well above, you said, &quot;If you do not compromise basic maintenance
&gt;procedures, you are insuring success&quot;.  Did I read that wrong?

Your absolutly correct. It was not my intend to hide meanings. In the first
statement, I had in mind what most people consider to be basic maintenance,
oil change every 3000 miles and a &quot;tune up&quot; when it starts to run poorly or
not at all. In the second statement I had in mind what I consider to be
basic maintenance. Oil changes based upon contaminant load alone, whether
that is 1000 or 10,000 miles and NO &quot;TUNE UPS&quot; AT ALL. In lue of &quot;tune ups&quot;,
maintenance inspections. If your maintenance is adequate, you never need a
&quot;tune up&quot;. Of course, you had no way of reading my mind. (Thank God for that.)
I regret the confusion. 


&gt;Parts do fail unexpectedly even when they are replaced at
&gt;&gt;sensible intervals.  Carrying spare parts is a smart thing to do IMO, DM or
&gt;&gt;no DM.



&gt;I'll take that to mean that you are not disputing the &quot;carry spare parts&quot;
&gt;issue anymore.

I dipute carrying spare parts so you can forget about maintenance, run
unto failure, they redeem yourself because you just happen to have the
particular part that failed. There are some people that carry 200 lbs of
spare parts due to their insecurity about the condition of their vehicle.
My premise is that if you ACTUALLY KNOW the condition of your parts, and
there is any probability that they are marginal, replace them BEFORE you
go. If I was heading out on a 5000 mile voyage, I would confirm current
condition of, let's say, the fan belt. Every tank of gas I would check
the oil and look at the fan belt. Oh, what's this??? That belt is becoming
glazed. In the next 1000 miles I'll stop at the most convienient place and
buy another one and continue to monitor the belt condition. At that point
that deterioration appears to be progressing up the curve to failure, but
before failure, I would replace it. Just one example.


&gt;p.s. Here's one the Germans tell about Americans:

&gt;How many Americans does it take to change a light bulb?
&gt;Six.  One to change the bulb and five to file the environmental impact
&gt;statement.

&gt;I'm not kidding, this was told to me by one of my German friends while I
&gt;was living over there.

Ain't it the truth. When two week projects began to run to two years of
planning department posturing, that's when I got out of surveying and 
engineering. Took all the fun out of it.

Thanks for the feedback.
