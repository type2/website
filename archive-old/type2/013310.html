&gt;Has anyone ever used one of those evaporative coolers that clamp in the 
&gt;passenger window in a type 2? I realize they mostly need low humidity to 
&gt;work well.

I used one back in '94 driving from Los Angeles to Austin, in August. I 
drove only at night, as I was going to college and had my bus loaded with 
my worldly possessions. This included 1 cat, 1 snake, and 1 pair of 
breeder rats and spawn, so the heat was a real issue-we camped out in 
Motels during the day. Anyway, I used the thing (again, at night) through 
the Mohave out to about AZ, and gave up on it. Couldn't really tell the 
difference between what came out of it and what came out of the air 
vents, and it killed my mileage. Temps were probably in the 80's or so, 
as this was the earlier part of the evening, in the desert, in late 
summer. Others may have had good luck with 'em, but not I...


Peace,
