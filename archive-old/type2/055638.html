Subject: What Now?

Hi, Thanks to everyone who resonded to my earlier question.  I checked all
conections at my double relay and replaced the points and now my bus
starts up beautifully (although I don't know if it is because of what I
did).  However now it seems that when I depress the gas pedal it revs up
but then stays there(sort of cruise control).  But then after about 5
seconds it returns to idle.  I checked the the throttle where the
accelerator cable attaches and it doesn't seem to be sticking at all.
What could be wrong?  This is my first vehicle so please excuse me if I am
asking too many questions but I can't seem to find an answer in any of my
manuals or anywhere else.  If anyone could point me in the right direction
I would realy appreciate it. Oh by the way it is a 1979 Fuel injected
Westy.  

Thanks,
Ken Fricke
79' Westy
