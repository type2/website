&gt; I just got a CV boot kit from BusDepot.  It's Meistersatz and I'm
&gt; wondering how it seals to the axle.

Richard,

As Jack mentions below, there was originally a metal pinch-clamp on the
small end of the original boot.  These clamps are wonderful, but you have
to have the proprietary tool (or be *very* lucky with a vice grip) to
apply them.  As the Forza article Jack metions says, a zip-tie works fine
here and that is what I usually use, if I use anything.  The real secret,
as the Forza article also mentions seems to be not to overpack the CV.

&gt; Technically, the small end of the boot slips onto a tube which
&gt; covers the axle.  Then the metal clip is secured over the small
&gt; end of the boot to hold it in place on the axle tube.

&gt; &gt; This is an image of the Febi and Lobro kits and they both have two extra
&gt; &gt; clips for the end of the boot.
&gt;
&gt; There's ONE metal clip in the photos.  Those other two things
&gt; are the dished washer and the circlip which holds he CV joint
&gt; on the axle.

The dished washer was deleted early on by VW and Bentley mentions not to
reinstall it even on early ones.  That said, I have gotten these in new CV
joints.  I do not install them because (a) VW says not to and (b) them
make getting the circlip on a real &lt;euphemism&gt; job &lt;/euphemism&gt; as you
have to force the CV onto the half shaft as you apply the circlip.  These
days, with the 3/4&quot; drive sockets in hand, I suppose it would be easy to
drive the circlip/CV/Washer sandwich on, but my memories of my one atempt
are not good.  In any event, the dished washer and circlip come with the
CV, if at all (the circlip is quite reuable and is usually *not*
supplied).  I have never seen them come with a boot kit.


I have (rarely) gotten the metal clamp with a boot kit, years ago, but not
recently.  As I said above, they are nice but you have to have the crimper
and it is expensive.  Zip ties work fine.  Use a zip tie.

The one thing that *should* come wiht a boot kit (as opposed to a boot) is
the bolts, plates, and serrated washers.  You don't mention these, but if
they were not included and the word &quot;kit&quot; was used, then I would say
something.

&gt; Since the topic of these clamps and CV boots has been broached,
&gt; let me get this off my chest...

&gt; I was reading a back issue of Forza magazine lasta month.
&gt; A guy at work is into Italian sports cars and he loaned me
&gt; that Ferrari enthusiast magazine to read.
&gt; There was an article which addressed early CV boot failure.
&gt; To paraphrase, too much grease or too thin of CV grease will
&gt; allow the grease to leave the CV joint and run into the boot.
&gt; Then centrifugal force takes over at speed and may cause the boot
&gt; to expand beyond it's intended size and possibly strike fixed
&gt; items, such as hot exhaust or metalwork.  (Of course the obvious
&gt; solution to this is to use the proper amount of the proper grease
&gt; only in the CV joint area.)  To prevent the CV boot from expanding,
&gt; attach zip ties around the accordian pleats of the boot, but do
&gt; not tighten the zip ties!  This way the boot cannot grow beyond
&gt; it's intended size.  It was also mentioned that the metal clip
&gt; for the small end of the boot could be omitted.  There is usually
&gt; enough of a ridge on the axle tube to keep the small end of the
&gt; boot in it's proper position.  And the boot will be allowed to
&gt; &quot;burp&quot; air from that place if it should ever need to.  That pretty
&gt; much sums up the Forza article on CV boots I read.  YMMV

Jack, Excellent reference!!!  I have never thought to put ties *in* the
accordion pleats, but the point about not overfilling the joint is well
taken.  Also the &quot;too thin&quot; remark.  There are a lot of lithium greases
out there now in addition to CV grease.  CVs need *CV* grease!!!!
