Hey Chet,


Oddly enough I had just worked on this yesterday (Thanks R). I dont know 
what your original problem was, but my temp sensor would not vary its signal 
from hot to cold correctly and was possibly the cause of my rich mixture, 
aka failed smog test, so we ripped it out of there.

It is a bi*ch to get out of there to, i know. We ended up cutting the wire 
coming from it, and with a 13mm deep ratchet you can grip the edges of it 
and start twisting it out of there. Be careful not to hit that hose going 
back into the firewall right behind it, mine was pretty loose at once point 
and when I checked under the wheel well you could see if had come 
disconncted.

A deep ratchet with a fairly short handle is probably your best bet on 
getting that bastard out of there I think..

Good luck!
Christopher

&gt;Hey all-
&gt;I've located my temp sensor (remeber the choking '77 FI Westy?) and it's 
&gt;not
&gt;loose like someone mentioned it should be if that's what my problem is.  In
&gt;fact, I can't get the bast*#d off!  I'm planning on a new dist
&gt;cap/rotor/points as well (thanks, Sean B.), which could also be the 
&gt;culprit,
&gt;right?  If anyone has a suggestions about this please let me know.  Thanks!
&gt;                                                  Chet Needham
