Ditto for me.  I've tried this test after tooling down the highway at =
60-68 mph for almost 5 hours straight......still could hold onto the =
loop of the dipstick with out it being uncomfortably hot.  My little =
1700 putts around pretty nicely (knock on dead trees), but could it =
really be running that cool?

Inquiring minds and all that.....

I read a post from someone recently who mentioned that he did not think =
the
Muir dip stick test was an accurate way to tell if  your engine is =
running hot
if you have a type 4 engine.  I guess I have to agree with this.  My dip
stick only gets slightly warm and would have to go a long way to be too =
hot
to hold onto.
So either the test works and I have a really cool running engine (I =
hope)
or the test is not real reliable with the type 4 engine.
Any other opinions out there?  I hope it works because it is real easy
indicator.
