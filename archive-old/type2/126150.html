Subject: Craftsman vs. Carquest coils

Dave

So i figured out what whent wrong in the tap trial and I thought I'd share
it with you... The tap you sent me was in fact for a 9mx1.25m coil. Prior
to the tap arriving I tapped the whole as per the specifications I found
on the internet for a Car Quest Heli Coil. The tap you sent me was made by
Craftsman i believe, and thus called for a different tap size. This must
be due to the fact that the two different companies produce coils with
varying diameters. The epilogue to this discovery was me ordering a $44
helicoil from Car Quest. Anyways, your tap is in the mail and should
arrive soon. Thanks again, the vw community relies on people like you who
share their wealth of knowledge and odd sized tools.
