Subject: FS:  '80 Vanagon Westfalia Camper

Any wannabussers/wannavanagoners(?) out there?

Blue 1980 Pop-Top Westfalia Vanagon L.

Full camping package, in generally good condition.  Stove works, 
have not used fridge or sink (sink pump does not turn on, but I 
have not checked the wiring.)  Cabinetry, etc. looks good. Pop-top 
canvas in good condition.  Front seats and sofabed bottom were 
reupholstered &amp; look good.  Has the swivel-out table at the rear, 
but no table in front.  

Van is from California, so there is no rust at all. Also no dents 
(other than a couple of little parking-lot dings). Paint is good. 
Looks very nice.

Air-cooled 2-liter fuel injected motor, hydraulic lifters (no valve 
adjustments needed). 110,000 miles.  4-speed, factory air (fans all 
work, but it does not seem to get cold.  Needs recharge?)  Runs 
well. Starts a little hard, suspect cold start valve (inexpensive).
 
Price:  $3500.00.
Located in Pa., between Philly and Allentown. E-mail or (610) 
754-8989.

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
