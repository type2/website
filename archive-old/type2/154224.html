Subject: RE: [T2] WOW!  

&gt; Has the price of these really gotten this high?!?

&gt; 
&gt; That's more than I pay for complete buses.......


No., that's high - it's $150 more than we charge for a rebuilt one. Unless
you didn't have a core to send back (which we require) I can't see spending
that much for a used one.
