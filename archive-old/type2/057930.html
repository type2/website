Subject: RE:  My 77 Transporter,,,,

&gt;My 77 Transporter (fuel injected)  gets to about 30 mph. &amp; then starts
&gt;chugging like it wants to cut out, I let off the gas alittle, (did I
say
&gt;it's also a automatic!?!) to engage the next gear, then accels fine
till 
&gt;about 40 mph. then all over again!

Other replies so far have only dealt with why your bus may or may not be
shifting properly.  What they have not addressed is why when you reach
high rpm (ie. each shift point) the engine starts cutting out.  

I don't know anything about the L-jet FI on buses, but some
ignition-related things to check are condition of spark plug and coil
wires, are your points set properly, are you getting proper advance from
your distributor, and is the coil OK.  Any of these 4 things can cause
high rpm missing/cutting out.
