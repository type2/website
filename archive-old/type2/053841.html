OK, there's a shortcut to removing A1 and A2 axles. Jack the car way up, to 
allow the wheel to travel all the way down.Unbolt the axle at both ends. Grab 
the outside of the inner CV joint, slide it towards the wheel on the axle, 
then push up and over the transmission.Pull the axle towards the center of 
the car until the stub comes out of the hub. Point the stub down at the 
ground and pull the axle assy. down and out of the car. For the left side, 
you also have to undo the plastic linkage on top of the trans. Pop the clip 
first, then remove it. This will save you a bit of time.     ED
