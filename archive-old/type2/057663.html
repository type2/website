Might be, but could also be a bad CV joint, or a brake problem like a
broken spring.

Can you describe the noise more completely?  Squeal, grinding,
clunking, or what?

You could also jack and pull the wheel so that you can rotate the drum
and feel how smooth the bearings are.

If the problem is CVs, then you should replace only the offending
joint. Some CVs last longer than others.  I have one CV marked &quot;70&quot; on
my bus with over 250,000 miles on it.

With the rear wheel bearings, I'd replace the offending bearing and
make sure that I had parts on hand to replace the other one.  I don't
think that I would actually replace it until it needed it, though.
