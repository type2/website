&gt; &gt; Call me dumb, but in all my years of VW-ing, I've never run into this~  My
&gt; &gt; engine keeps eating fan belts, that is, the belt itself actually wears
&gt; down.
&gt; &gt;   There's fan belt shavings everywhere in the engine compartment.
&gt; &gt; Belt tension is good and there doesn't seem to be any rough spots on my
&gt; &gt; pulley.  Any ideas?

Been there, got the T-Shirt...

The generator backing plate is made for a 38 amp BUS generator but the
generator is  a 30 amp B*G model...

try that. It should show up as an indention in the backing plate to
accomodate the longer 38 amp gen.  There's pics on the Hon. Ron Van
Ness's Rebuild pages in the library.

Good Luck
