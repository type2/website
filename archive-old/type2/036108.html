Subject: Brake drum saga.... CONGRATS!

|Jen on Long Island -----  Glad to read you brought your frozen brake drum
|problem to a successful conclusion!  Now that the pressure is off, so to
|speak, how about telling about the puller you bought?  and what it cost?
|and where?  This is an item of general interest (as you found out).
|
|Concerning replacement drums, what are your plans?  I regret to say that in
|moving ~3 yrs ago I gave away maybe a dozen Type 2 drums.  Can try to get 1
|or 2 back..... That would depend on hearing from you.  Thanks.
