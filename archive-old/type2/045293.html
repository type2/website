Try a marine supply store - I remember seeing a post here about that before.

&gt; I had a lazy (mostly) weekend in which I spent most of the time with Lurch.
&gt; No major work (not yet) -- just futzing around with this 'n that.
&gt;
&gt; I washed the curtains.  Hooboy, hadn't been washed in decades.
&gt;
&gt; They held together OK, BUT I'm out four of those little sliders that fit in
&gt; the channels above the doors.  These are the original sliders, and I rescued
&gt; two out of the washer and three out of the dryer.  I had sewed a few on and
&gt; tightened the ones I thought were loose before putting them through the
&gt; washer.  Anyhoo, the curtains, while making the wash water an unsightly
&gt; grey/brown, are only a little cleaner than before.
&gt;
&gt; The upstart of all this is:  does anyone have a handful of those original
&gt; sliders they would be willing to part with?  Sale or trade?  Lurch would
&gt; certainly appreciate it!
