I have a thin line filter sump kit from California Imports ( pg 128 in Cat.)
and i Went to change the oil today.....well as i was draining the oil out I
loosened the last bolt and out fell the thin line filter....the problem is
that i didntt see how it was in there......so i put it back in the way i
thought ...filled it with oil and started it but got some knocking from
it.....so i drained the oil out and here i am....i got this 1971 bus less
than a year ago and wasnt the one that put the pump in...so iam kinda
stuck...any ideas?

The filter it self looks like a air breather and there are 2 metal peices
that fit into it with a spring on top of that and then a rubber cup
