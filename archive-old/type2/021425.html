Subject: Steering wheel interchange

I have the parts to check it out, but I'm hoping that someone has BTDT
before me...

Will an '83 Vanagon steering wheel fit on a '77 steering column? The
'77s wheel is cracked and way too thin for my big hands.  The Vanagon's
wheel is big and cushy and just what I'd like to have.

TIA.

Jim
