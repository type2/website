Subject: RE: Deal on Boge shocks!

&gt;&gt; cornering, wind (ok, not much, but with a bus...every
&gt;&gt; little bit counts), nose-dive when under hard-braking
&gt;&gt; (BIGGGGG PLUS, here!)....

&gt;Nose dive should not have been greatly improved as you say it was.  This
&gt;tends to make me think that your 5-year-old OEM shocks (if that's what they
&gt;were) were more severely worn than you think. You were replacing 5 year old

Nose dive indeed would have been greatly improved, gas charged shocks offer
some suspending (springing) characteristics as the pressurized gas over oil
resists body weight to the tune of the area of the seal by the pressure of
the gas.

A hydraulic (stock) shock don't do no springing, it is what a shock is,
merely a
damper.  Under braking and transients it does resist dive trivially by how
much
fluid can be pushed how fast though such a small hole in the valving but
mostly
is still a damper not a spring, the transient time of braking is rather
long compared
to what a damper is meant to resist (oscillations in the road surface) and
I'm sure
the stockers offer little effective resistance over such a relatively long
period.

As to which is better I won't get into it, I like the KYB's all round on
Vanagon's
as a replacement when the excessively expensive Boge's wear out (which BTW
doesn't often happen till 80-100k or better) but have never had them on a bay.
Hydraulic have always suited me on a Bus but who knows what I've been missing,
people I trust tell me the KYB's are _at_$#% busters though, but perception is
what U
make of it, how old you and your kidneys are, etc.
