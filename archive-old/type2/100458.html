Subject: Re: [T2] clymer

&gt;I may look at it for a better view of some part or another opinion on how
&gt;to do something, don't burn it but make it your last choice for
&gt;information


I agree the Bentley is a MUCH better manual overall, and I would consider it 
a necessity.  BUT.  The Clymer book I have was the ONLY reference I could 
find information on my one piece throttle-valve positioner.  It had a nice 
diagram and photos that the Bentley did not have.  I keep mine in the 
glovebox 'cause the Bentley doesn't fold very well... ;^)
