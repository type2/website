Subject: Re: [T2] HELP! Clark Griswald Strikes Again!

Key on no power up front turn it over from the remote starter no spark or 
power to the coil. Put a direct lead from the battery to the coil opened the 
Air Flow Meter moved the flap hear the relay click. No fuel pump. I know it 
works great no juice over there either. I don't think there is any power to 
the fuse panel. I think this issue does not have anything to do with the 
engine work but more like the A/C removal. Big black wire hanging from the 
fuse block no power on it.

&gt;From: Access Systems try turning the key on and then using the rear starter 
&gt;and see if it
&gt;catches??  might help narrow down weather your searching for a power or
&gt;starter problem and weather it is front or back...


&gt;electrical problems, they take ten hours to find and ten minutes to fix
