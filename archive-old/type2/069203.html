Subject: Re: oil changes, vanagon

Latest report from Consumers on oils says 7500 miles is not too long.
Standard VW wisdom says 3000 miles. VW's being air-cooled (therefore
cooler, but hotter) might actually need more frequent changes than
water-cooled (eewww!) machinery. If it's wasserboxer, why ask us? Anyway,
you can make up your own mind, but oil is still cheaper than an engine (for
the present).

&gt; How often?  I say 5,000 miles is reasonable (a modern Toyota
&gt; supposedly needs oil change at 7,000 miles or so) but it seems some
&gt; believe every 1,500 or so is necessary or the engine will be at risk,
&gt; even with modern oils. Is German iron that different from Japanese? 
&gt; What's reasonable?  Cheers...
