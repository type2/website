Subject: Re: [T2] acid rust removal

&gt;I was reading with interest on Richards site about using acid as a rust
&gt;treatment on the body sheetmetal. I am considering doing the same thing with
&gt;my '78, only I would like a little more detail on acid used, strength, time
&gt;applied before neutralizing, etc.

I was using it to remove the rust from the battery trays. I bought some muratic acid from Home Depot in the pool cleaning section. If you can find a smaller container than 1 gallon I would go for that instead. They tend to sell you 2 gallons for about $7 which is a lot of acid.

I mixed the acid to water (not the other way around!) 1:1 and poured it onto the battery tray and let it steam for about 10 seconds. I then shook some baking soda over it until I saw the acid reaction abate and then used a steel wire brush to break up and remove the rust:

After:

The acid is extremely dangerous so I can't stress enough the need for clothing and breathing and eyesight protection while working with it.

&gt;I would also appreciate any comments from
&gt;those that have done this type of rust treatement as to how it has held up
&gt;over time.

I had to paint the battery trays afterward.
