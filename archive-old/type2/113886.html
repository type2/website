Subject: Re: [T2] Fwd:Accident lawyers needed

I am glad to hear that everyone involved is okay, and saddened to see the heavy damage to a very rare bus.  I keep asking myself though... how fast could a heavily loaded highroof splitty towing another bus go down the highway?  My mind drifts back to memories of the drive to BBTB 2000, while pulling a slight grade at night in my bus at 55mph I came up rapidly behind a couple of splitties.  I estimate they were going ~35mph (and they weren't towing anything).
