Dear Kevin.

I am not sure about the procedure for jump starting a 1975-83 VW Type 2 with 
Bosch L-jetronic fuel injection (I believe it is possible to do it in some 
way, without damaging the ECU!?), but have you ever considered fitting an 
old-fashioned starting handle.

For this to work, you would have to have a cut-off switch for the cold-start 
injector and preferably the auxiliary air regulator too.

I will find out how successful this is, when I get around to fitting, my 
much modified 1911cc, VW 411LE engine, with Bosch D-jetronic fuel injection 
engine, into my 1973 VW 1600 Type 2.

The starting handle worked well, on the 1600 engine, with single Minnow Fish 
carburettor!

I'm hoping to devise a slightly more sophisticated system sometime, to 
synchronise the cold-start injector, with the main injectors, rather than 
cut-off the cold-start injector completely.

Regards.
