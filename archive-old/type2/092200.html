Subject: Looking for a new oil pump

I am trying to locate a supplier for a new oil pump for my 78 2000 cc FI
engine. Had hopes of getting one of those genuine VDublU pumps from Bus
Depot but by the time I managed to squeeze the bucks out of my budget
they were gone! What to do now? Got a message back that they have the
cast iron Melling pumps. Don't know about them though, I've been warned
about using them since the 70's, The old steel vs aluminum expansion
argument. Almost everywhere I have looked this is all they sell.

If I can't get the original I would like to have a good quality
blueprinted aluminum oil pump, possibly hard anodized. Anyone know where
I can get one?

Thanks
Tom
