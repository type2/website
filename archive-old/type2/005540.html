A snug connecting rod, especially if one is more so than the rest,
is definitely worth  examining. It can be removed without splitting the case,
just don't drop the nuts or bearing shells.
 There is a  possibility that the rod bearing has spun in the journal,
and if so, the repair will include damage to the crankshaft,
which does require the case open. If not, the rod can be reinstalled.
Drain the oil  into a clean container and look for &quot;silver &quot;.

&gt;Should the connecting rods be snug or very loose on the crank on a Type 4
&gt;engine?

&gt;I have 3 that move very easily and one that is snug.  Is this a problem?
&gt;Need new rod bearings? Do I have to split the case to do it?
