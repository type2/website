&gt; &gt; 34 ICT's are pretty small carbs, aren't they?  What size engine do you have
&gt; &gt; 1800 Type IV?  What type of muffler, stock -- or did you go to a larger
&gt; &gt; after market?
&gt; 
&gt; --&gt; Sorry for not including more detail.  It's a 1970cc Type IV.  The
&gt; muffler is a rusted-out piece of crap Monza-style thing installed by the
&gt; PO...the exhaust system leaks like a seive, which is the next thing I plan
&gt; to fix, if I ever get this problem solved.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sounds to me like you are running real lean... rejetting -- what is your
&gt; &gt; Main Jet?  Have you even checked?
&gt; 
&gt; --&gt; Haven't checked yet...how difficult is it?  I know I need to take the
&gt; tops off the carbs, but what then?  I've never taken a carb apart before.
&gt; I'm beginning to wonder if the jets are gummed up...the carbs were pulled
&gt; off a working engine, but sat for a while, or so I'm told.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then, learning on &quot;used&quot; isn't much fun either -- especially when you are
&gt; &gt; learning :)
&gt; 
&gt; --&gt; So I'm finding.  Maybe I would have been better off to go with a new
&gt; progressive (new duals are out of my price range.)
David:
Do you have a balance tube between the two  manifolds?
Dual single barrels need a balance tube to even out the impulses because 
the adjacent cylinders fire consecutively. In other words, firing order
(as you carbs see it) is: 2,1,4,3. So what the right carb sees is:
2,1,_,_,2,1,_,_, and so on. The left carb sees similar pulses. So what
happens is that  2 gets a lot richer mix than 1 and 4 gets a richer mix
than 3.
What the factory does is hook the plenums under the carbs together with
a fairly large tube- 1/2&quot; diameter or so. This allows the manifolds to
sort of borrow from the other carb and even out the pulses.
All factory systems that I've observed have this balance tube:
72-74 type 2's (later years in other markets than U.S.), early type 3's
(little foggy on this, it's been a long time), also all Porsches prior
to late 1957(1600N w/2 Solex 32pbic's used a balance tube about 5/8&quot; ID-
just measured one!)
This is also the place to put a tee for the vac booster for the brakes.
Having said this, the next thing is to see if your carb jets are open.
Take the carbs apart, one at a time, take the jets out, write down the
numbers and draw a sketch of where each goes, hold them up to a light to
see if they're clean. If they're complicated jets like solex idle jets,
try a little oral pressure (blow thru them). I always like to see if I
can find something wrong (nearly always do), then blow out all
passageways with Gumout or other spray-can carb cleaner with a straw.
Apply the straw to each hole in turn, try to see that the spray comes
out somewhere. There may be some blind holes, but not very often. When
carbs sit around, many of these small passageways may varnish up. Don't
feel too bad, motorcycles and boat motors are even worse, and are almost
always used seasonally with long dormant cycles. I sometimes use a bit
of wire to remove a piece of crud from a passageway, but remember to go
carefully and not remove any metal because most holes in carbs are
precisely sized and I'm not a carb engineer. Reassemble using your
sketch for a guide. Try  not to bend the float attachment points. I have
no idea what to set the float on a Weber, but at the very least try to
observe how far up the float has to rise to shut off the fuel flow.
(Someone else know this number?)
Now do the same for the other carb.
Try em again.
If they still act lean, it may be time to do some rejetting, but it
should at least idle and move with most anything in there.
The next thing to consider is timing and distributor selection.
What are you using for a distributor, do you have the vac advance hooked
up, and to where?
That's enough for now!
