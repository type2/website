Subject: Re: Bus Pollution

I was surprised at bus folks non-concern for exhaust emissions when I
entered the VW world.  I figured all the hippies would have environmental
sensitivity on the top of their list.  Then again I guess I'm young and
stupid.

Sticking one of Ron's $99 catalytic converter on your exhaust and not
running rich would do a lot.  I recently did this taking off my one piece
exhaust and piecing a stock exhaust system together for $400 (cat included).
The cat fits between the Y pipe and the muffler.  Makes the exhaust smell oh
so sweet while setting your timing.  You can also still get EGR filters
which lower combustion temperatures and consequently nitrous oxides.

Good luck,
Christopher Darilek

Subject: Bus Pollution


&gt; Someone commented that a Bus would probably produce as much pollution as a
&gt; new V8 Jeep.  I think that the Bus would be much worse.  Has anyone done
an
&gt; emissions test of their Bus and compared it to new vehicles?  I imagine
&gt; that the newer FI catalyst-equipped busses would fare best, but it seems
&gt; that pollution control technology has come a long way since they were new.
&gt;
&gt; That Honda commercial hits home to a guy who wants to be environmentally
&gt; friendly.  Can the Bus be modified to run cleaner?
