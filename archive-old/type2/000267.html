I have a problem that I put down to an old/faulty master cylinder.....I
subsequently had it replaced, but the problem remains with me.

On a 1971 bus, the following occurs:
after driving for some time, the pedal freeplay disappears, the pedal gets
very wooden, and, it feels to me as if the brakes are engaging, albeit
slightly.
As far as I know, I have discs on the front, and I have recently had the
back brakes overhauled for my annual MOT certificate.
The entire system was bled when I had the new master fitted.
This problem goes away, the brakes returning to normal, and returns at will.

I am going on a relatively long trip soon and would hate my brakes to seize
on me.
Any ideas............Garp
...have tried to access archives but I seem to be having
difficulty...probably due to the change of server.
