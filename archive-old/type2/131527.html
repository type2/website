Subject: Re: [T2] Leak Down Test

Thanks Richard. Can a tester be found at a FLAPS? Or is this a specialty 
item?

&gt;From: Richard Atwell You need to buy a tester (get the kind with two 
&gt;gauges) and you need a supply of compressed air. Bring each cylinder to TDC 
&gt;to do the measurement. You want to measure the percentage of leak down as 
&gt;well as the maximum difference between any two cylinders.
