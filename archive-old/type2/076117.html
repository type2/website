Subject: Re: [T2] Putting on Michelin LTX LT 195/75R-14/C tires.



&gt;&gt; Anyone confirm?
&gt;
&gt;I am running 205/R70-14 and based on my before after speedo calibration
&gt;the difference is almost nil, maybe 4% on the speedo
&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am running 205/75R-14 - a little taller than stock.

I am running new 205/75s (which replaced 195/75s) and I have noticed the
change in gearing in my camper. These tires are now going on my new
passenger bus which is quite a bit lighter and I am getting 205/70s for my
camper. The change is very subtle, I live in a hilly area and I notice I
can't get up the same hills I used to in 4th gear unless I am going at
least 60 if not 65MPH. Essentially, the &quot;sweet spot&quot; or peak power in
relation to speed has shifted up just a few MPH. If you live in a flatter
area or aren't putting them on a heavy camper it may all be good for you.
I'm just glad I didn't go for the 215/75 or 27x8.5 as I was considering.

And especially when it comes to tires and gearing YMMV :-)
