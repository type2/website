Subject: ATTN:Richard Atwell / vacuum hose guide

Hi Richard,

I was looking over my vacuum hoses today and quickly came to the conclusion
that they pretty much all need to be replaced. They're dried, cracked and
plain worn out. I was looking over your article on the vacuum hoses. Great
info and just what I needed. I was wondering if you had replaced all of your
hoses? If so where were you able to find all the different sizes? I noticed
that some of the hoses had part numbers listed. Are those still available from
the dealer? Thanks for any wisdom.

Jasan C.
