&gt;&gt; Just got the NAPA (#MA758) air shocks for my 78 Bus to quick fix my saggy

&gt;I would be wary using any kind of shock to correct torsion bar sag as the
shock
&gt;supports are not designed to bear any significant portion of the vehicle
weight.

Let us please not reopen this thread, but readers of this list should
remember when I asked for feedback from those with actual first-hand
experiences.  One list member had a broken shock mount he blamed on a
coil-over shock.  Eight or nine list members reported no problems.  I now
have 100k on the NAPA coil-over shocks and am very pleased.
