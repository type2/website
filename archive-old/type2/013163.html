I think we'd all like to see the configuration you come up with. Post
some pics.

I'm not a winter camper so I'm always outside except cooking or sleeping.

I use a little 6&quot; 12v computer fan to suck the cooking oils away from my
interior fabrics.

But I must admit, after I cook bacon in my camper I drive around
Salivating for three weeks afterwards.
