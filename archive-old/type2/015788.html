&gt;This is done in the watercooled world all of the time, but
&gt;they dont use one lobe to work two lifters.

True, but I don't see why that would keep it from working.

&gt;What I always thought would make a nice design would
&gt;be a spherical ball stamped into the end of the lifter, but
&gt;free to move around.

I like how you're thinking, but I don't think that would work.  The ball
would be in contact with the lifter over a large percentage of it's
surface, and only in contact with the cam at one point (tangent).  Two
consequences of this are 1) all the pressure concentrated on one point
would be very tough on the cam (almost like using a pointy-ended lifter),
and 2) the ball would not turn due to the differences in contact area - it
would tend to stay in contact with the lifter and slide across the cam lobe.

I noticed that plain old Chevy V-8 hydraulic lifters look almost idential
to the ones in my VW.  This leads me to believe that there might just be a
hydraulic roller lifter with a bore that would fit the type IV case.  All
that would remain would be to find a way to keep the lifter from turning
and adjust the length of the pushrods (cut and weld, or replace) to
compensate for any change in the length of the lifter.  Voila, kiss your
camshaft wear problem goodbye.  Then stick in a higher-lift and/or faster
ramp rate cam and some better rockers and say hello to some more horsepower!
