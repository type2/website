Subject: smoken and drippen and....

The first signs I had that the seat was dropping
was puffs of smoke on start up. As it got worse
it smoked all the time and tailpipe was black with
oil. Then it got real bad! Killing all of the flying
insects in the neighborhood.
   Soooo valve job time. If you have a carbed
fuel system you can keep the old brass alloy seats.
Bore them out to fit the diameter of the throttle
shaft. shave the OD of the seat down untill you have
a thin walled bushing. Drill out the worn hole through
which the throttle shaft fits to the OD of your new
bushing and press fit it in. No more slop in the
throttle shaft which makes it easier to sync those
original carbs. I think the seat material will last
longer then the carb material does.  

  Black tape over the VW emblem at the VoA show is
brilliant! Setting up a booth could be iffy.

  Attached side tents are cool but.... I would opt.
for a attached awning with a free standing tent. Set
the tent so that the awning goes over it some and
you have the side tent with a covered access to it.
Need to go for supplies? Roll in the awning an drive
away.
  Living in your bus.... maybe for a week or two. But
if I was forced into that situation I would appreciate
any help. Be it a shower, constructive advice, or
just a safe place to overnight now an then. If this
list isn't the place to ask for help then I dont know
where would be. If I was willing to help I'd let the
person that asked know (p-mail), if I didnt want to
help
I think I'd just say nothing. Being homeless is a 
scarey thought. Being homeless doesnt equal being
friendless... I hope.

Later,
