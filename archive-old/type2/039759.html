&gt; A while back a listee said something like  &quot;...Armour All is terrible for
&gt;  your dashboard.&quot;  Why?  What's the long term downside and do you know of a
&gt;  product that cleans/shines like that stuff, but doesn't do the bad stuff?

What it does is to pull the &quot;plasticisers&quot; out of the plastic - makes it 
shiny, but it no longer has the &quot;moisture&quot; to make it supple (like old 
pavement - the oil evaporates over years and cracks and weeds grow through - 
you see this a lot in Nevada!!) - and the now stiff nougahyde breaks and 
cracks **JUST* like old, dried out leather.

Does the same to tires, vynil tops, all that stuff...  anything thats a 
petroleum-based substance.  Even does in plastic after a while.

How I know?  They did a big-dollar test where I work (Caltrans) to find out 
why these &quot;new&quot; trucks were replacing dashboards and tires and upholstery 
every few years... and after the ban, the problem (with the newer trucks) 
went away 100%.  Once they've been squirted, tho, the process starts.  

Stay away from that stuff!  Serious.  (And sorry, Armor - all!)

I saw this silicone sealer that might show some promise, but after having the 
proof, as it were, put in my face, I don't put anything on it, but to wash it 
once in a while!  And guess what?  It works!  And cost?  &lt;grin&gt; Works for a 
single mom!
