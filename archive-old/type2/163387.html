Subject: Re: [T2] Which Piston rings?

The correct rings for the 1700 would be

http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=021198175 - Original German Ring
Set for 1700 (021 198 175)
OR
http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=021198175G - Grant mfr'd Ring Set
for 1700 (021 198 175 G).  I've used Grant dozens of times over the years
with no problems (YMMV).

The other listing is for rings on the &quot;Big Bore&quot; Performance Piston Sets
using 96mm pistons.

The O-Ring does come with the Gasket set, but the crank seals do not.
Order them separately. Order the following:

http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=021198009B = Engine Gasket Set
(021 198 009 B)

http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=021105247A = Crank Pulley Seal
(021 105 247 A)

http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=029105245B = Flywheel Seal (029
105 245 B)

What with the Holiday madness of ordering &amp; shipping items, I would have
ordered this stuff long ago, not now, to make it for between Christmas &amp; New
Years.  Break down and telephone them (or someone else), don't depend on the
internet to get yer stuff to you in the time frame you want.  As an example,
Bus Deport most likely doesn't have the rings on their shelf and probably
has them drop shipped from the supplier.  Ditto on the gasket set, just not
that much call on 1700 stuff these days.  Some of these outfits (not Bus
Deport, the suppliers) close up for the holidays, especially in years where
Xmas &amp; New Years are a week apart vis a vis weekend to weekend.

Pick Up The Phone NOW and start ordering verbally from Bus Depot or CIP1.

Disclaimer:  I have no affiliation with Bus Depot or CIP1.

&gt; Anyone know what's up with Bus Depot? I've sent a few emails now and they
&gt; all
&gt; return with...
&gt; Warning: message still undelivered after 4 hours
&gt; Will keep trying until message is 5 days old
&gt; I need to order some parts and have them delivered between Christmas and
&gt; New
&gt; Years, but there are three choices of piston rings (without a lot of
&gt; detail
&gt; about any of them). I and am hoping to get an answer so I can get the
&gt; order
&gt; in as soon as possible...
&gt; Can anyone else shed some light on which rings I need? Thanks.
&gt; My engine:
&gt; 1973, 1700 cc, dual carb, automatic
&gt; pistons are standard (imprinted with 9706)
&gt; On Busdepot webite, here are the three choices:
&gt; http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=02119817596
&gt; http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=021198175G
&gt; http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=021198175
&gt; Also, does the gasket kit include the flywheel o-ring?
