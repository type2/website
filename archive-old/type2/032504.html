Actually Biagio me (Tim) and my girlfriend (Heather) just finished doing
such a thing back in December. We set off in August not knowing where we
were headed or when we would be back. It was great. You just gave me the
motivation to finally write to the bus list......

Thanks for sharing that with us, over here in the UK we can only dream of doing such a thing and it's so good to hear of folk who are using their bus for what busses are for (next time film it!!!).
One day.....one day......sigh!!!
