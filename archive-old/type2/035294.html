Since I don't have a nice wiring schematic for a 78, this is a guess based on
the schematic for an earlier bus.  Check the ground wire that grounds the left
head light.  On earlier busses this wire also grounds the left turn indicator.
If the wires are not grounding properly the headlight is probably trying to
ground through the turn indicator which could cause all kinds of crazy things
to happen.

&gt; When the headlights are turned on the left front turn filament is on full.
&gt; The left blinker does not work when the lights are on. When I looked closer
&gt; I noticed that the turn filament in all of the remaining lights is on but
&gt; very dim. Any Ideas?
