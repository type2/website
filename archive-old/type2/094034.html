Subject: Re: [T2] Painting question

I used to have 2 spray guns.  both air powered.  one was a large 
container gravity feed and then a smaller volume (detailer gun) suction 
feed.  I found that even though i had to fill my little conainer more 
often i could use the smaller gun much easier.  so a friend made an 
offer on my bigger gun and i sold it.  I am very happy with the smaller 
gun dont know what a price would be on them now but i paid about 80 
dollars 10 years ago
I find that the compressed air sprayers seem to handle the thinner 
automotive spray jobs much better and for the most part are easier to  
clean up afterwards.  Also buy you paint from a &quot;pro&quot; shop that has 
people that know auto paint chem systems.  Then you always get the 
correct combinations of base, top, hardeners, thinners, and cleanup for 
the job.

&gt; Why not quit listening to the list and go to a NAPA store, I think a
&gt; $195.00 gravity feed spray gun is what you need. You do not need a high
&gt; dollar *airless system*.
&gt; Many times I just drive around to a few backyard body shops and ask what
&gt; they're using.
&gt; Check out the cleaning procedures on whatever you buy, simple is better
&gt; when you only use the gun twice a year.
&gt; perfect for my needs.. happily also the state-of-the-art way
&gt;&gt; of being environment friendly and doing a nice job, too. It looks
&gt;&gt; like these systems go for around $600 to $800, and they are very
&gt;&gt; compact. Can you make any other recommendations regarding the
&gt;&gt; relative quality of different brands? Are systems now much better
&gt;&gt; than older, used ones? Any other comments or tips?
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance! Jan B
