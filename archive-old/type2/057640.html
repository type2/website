Subject: Trying to diagnose spun fan before pulling .. am I nutz?

Here's hoping the list is back up :)

I've scheduled time over Labor Day to pull the engine and fix my spun fan.
The fan will turn on the shaft probably 20-30 degrees by hand.

Looking in RMMW, trying to have parts on hand before starting [I know, one
can only dream], I see a fan hub 211 119 123 as well as the fan itself 113
119 031B. Each is in the 20 buck range.

I can't seem to find a very good picture of this setup....but it would seem
to me that the problem is a shorn-off woodruff key on the front of the
generator, which would have bunged up the hub. Is this a fair assessment? Or
could the fan itself be bunged up, allowing it to rotate on the fan?

I don't wanna spend bucks on unnecessary parts, but I don't want to have the
engine sitting on the ground for a week waiting for parts.

Any input appreciated.
