Subject: 1970 transporter project for sale

 unhappy Friday all,
 I hate to do this but for reasons out of my control I need to sell all of my 
VW
 parts and bus.
 the bus is a 1970 deluxe transporter sun roof.
 she has westy windows and a rear slider, body has some small dents, dings 
and a small hole at the windshield (no engine)
 the engine I was going to place in her is a 1976 2000cc hydraulic lifter re 
build with only 2500 miles and an upright fan shroud kit(just bought it from 
Oregon performance
new partly in stalled $500.00)
 I also have some other westy parts front seats, sink cab,and upper rear cab.
 and 2liter cooling parts.
 I'm looking for $900 for the bus and $2500 for the motor includes shroud and 
all parts to fit into older type 2 van.
 I'm real sad that this has to be done
 I'm in sanleandro CA (near Oakland)
 so fellow bus people tell your friends and help make this fast and as 
painless as it can be.
 thanks to all
    crow
                   I have a few pics I can send
