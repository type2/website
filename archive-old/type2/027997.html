Well, my personal experience has been that hot, soapy water -- either dish washing, or preferably laundry soap -- works very well on engine tin and other very greasy components. A little soaking; a lot of scrubbing. Lots of rinsing.

Can't suggest any waterless cleaning solutions...no experience there.

Good luck! Joe
