Subject: steering

Anyone ever had this problem? This is the first time it's ever happened to 
me, several times today, after I've taken a turn while in motion, my steering 
wheel ends up in a different position when I'm going straight. It's VERY 
noticeable. It ended up in three different positions before I got home today. 
Any ideas before I tear into it?
TIA
