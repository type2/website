Subject: Smog Test in Santa Barbara

Hi all -

I don't usually see anyone posting from around here,
but I notice there are a few Santa Barbarians on the
AIRS list, so maybe you're all hiding in the wings...

Anyway - I was wondering if anyone knows of a
smog-check station in or around Santa Barbara, CA,
that is old-VW-friendly? I'm looking for someone who
will not do their best to send me to the breaker's
yard, but will maybe do some tune-up and try to help
me pass.

The only ones I've found seem to be miserable as hell.
Maybe it's the carbon monoxide...?

Please help me through this traumatic bi-annual event!

cheers

Matthew
