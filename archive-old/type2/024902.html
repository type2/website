Subject: Paint and Body shop in Northern CA?

Hi All,

First off I would like to thank everyone on this list for all of the help.
Responses have been amazing, and very helpful.  I would especially like to
thank John Baker for giving me a AC/DC fridge for my ASI that was in perfect
working condition.

My question today is this... I have finished all of the cabinet and woodwork
inside the bus, so the last thing I need to do is get a decent paintjob.
Unfortunately I do not know enough to do this myself.  So I was hoping that
some list members from Northern California might be able to provide some
references to a decent paint/body shop that does good VW work, and wont
break me at the same time.

Thanks in advance for the help,

Nick
