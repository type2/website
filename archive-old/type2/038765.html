Subject: Oil Cooler Tester

Hi,

We want to convert to a doghouse cooler and we have several from other
engines we have but they need to be tested. We found an oil cooler tester
available through RMMW but they said it was out of stock and won't be in
until a certain date... that date keeps moving forward every time we call to
see if it's in!

Anyone know where else to get one of these testers??

Thanks,
Jen
