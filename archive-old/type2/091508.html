Subject: can't get my shifter adjusted right

Have you adjusted the plate at the base of the
shifter?
If it has shifted around it could cause the type of
problems you are talking about. Just follow the manual
instructions. Look at the pictures carefully as it is 
easy to get turned around as to which which is which.
Also if it is worn badly then it may not be adjustable
any longer... wear will be apparent. When I got mine
to where I wanted it I outlined the position on the
floor with a sharpie... for some reason it took a fair
number of attempts to get it right...

Just a thought....

&gt; handle. I replaced all the bushings last spring
except the plastic guide 
&gt; bushing in the middle. I
&gt; did inspect it and it was fine, I regreased
everything then also. I 
&gt; played with the
&gt; adjustment a little this summer,but ended up leaving
it cause it worked. 
&gt;  How do I get this thing adjusted.? Any tips?
