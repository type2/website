&gt; Provided that the aftermarket CDI is designed for those plugs.  Not all
&gt; are.  The simple &quot;point replacement&quot; devices like the pertronix are
&gt; designed to work with the conventional coil and plugs.  If the CDI
&gt; system doesn't specify platinum plugs, then it is probably designed for
&gt; conventional plugs.  You can use platinum's, and it will probably run, but
&gt; you gain nothing and might lose a bit due to misfire.

 CDI stands for Capacitor Discharge Ignition. The Pertronix unit is not in 
any way, shape or form a CDI system. It is a simple points replacement unit. 
Do not confuse a points replacement system for a CDI, even if they are 
billing it as some sort of &quot;high energy ignition&quot;, &quot;spark booster&quot;, etc. In 
fact, I use a pertronix to trigger my CDI. A typical CDI system will provide 
400+ volts to the primary side of the coil. This gives you 30-40kv constant 
to the plugs, Regardless of rpm. The only disadvantage to a CDI unit is that 
the spark is a shorter duration than a conventional Kettering system, which 
makes the platinum plugs ideal, as they require almost no resistance/build up 
time to fire. Some CDI systems correct for the shouter spark duration by 
firing several times in a row, for a predetermined number of degrees of 
crankshaft rotation. MSD System CDI's come to mind, as MSD stands for 
Multiple Spark Discharge.
