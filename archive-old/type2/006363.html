The most mileage I have seen is 625,ooo on a shortblock,with 2 valve jobs...

I saw a 912E with 321,000 that had never been touched..The original owner
brought it in for a tune up, and it lost a ring in our parking lot.

&gt; &gt; I'd take that challenge,
&gt; &gt; especially if Rick keeps towing stuff ;-)  It'd be no contest on a 1/4
mile
&gt; &gt; though...stock fuel injection is great but no match for my 42DCNFs
(sorry
&gt; &gt; Rick).
&gt;
&gt; Just to let everyone know how strong even an old type 4 is, the 2L engine
&gt; that I had in my bus came out of a rusty westy that was purchased with
&gt; 170,000 showing as the milege.  The engine had been sitting so long, all
th
&gt; seals had to be replaced because they were dried out.  It took close to 50
&gt; miles before all the hydraulic valves pumped up the first time.
&gt;
&gt; This engine has seen a bunch of miles, yet it just went from Kansas to
Cal,
&gt; stopping in Arizona to pick up a Scamp then pulling it to Cal and back.
&gt; Also along the way, one of the splitty busses in the caravan quit and so I
&gt; towed it from half way through Cal to Flagstaff which is a long uphill
&gt; grade.
&gt;
&gt; The engine and bus did great, never really got hot and had good power,
&gt; considering the load it was pulling and carrying.  Type 4 engines are
built
&gt; to last, of course as with any engine, there will be a bad one now and
then.
&gt;
&gt; If any of you know Charlie Ford and his bus the Mother Ship, he has over
&gt; 200,000 on his engine and it has yet to have a valve job!
&gt;
&gt; So Steve, this engine has already stood the test of time and is still
giving
&gt; me miles of smiles!!  But it would still be fun to race!!  Just name the
&gt; time and place buddy, are we racing for pink slips?
