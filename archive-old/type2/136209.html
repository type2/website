Subject: Re: [T2] New busser introducing himself and vacuum advance

Welcome to the wonderful world of 009's and 34pic
carbs.  Very bad combination as you have noticed.

Yes, you need to replace that dist with one that has
both vacuum and centrifugal advance. There are better
choices out there then the one-year-only stock dist.

Anyway... I observed that there is no vacuum advance
 on my distributor, even 
 though the stock 1600cc dp from 1971 is supposed to
 have vacuum advanced 
 timing.
 
 What kind of loss/benefit can be expected from this
 ? I have seen several 
 1600 engines (thanks ebay) that seen to not have
 vacuum lines connected to 
 the distributor. Is that due to poorely educated
 repairman or is there no 
 benifit to vacuum advance ? Can the advance timing
 be added to the 
 distrubutor or do I need to purchase a new one ?
 
 My engine runs well at highway speed, I guess it is
 around 3500rpm. It 
 hesitates a lot and has little power in the lower
 rpms.  I was wondering if 
 these things are in relation.
