Subject: Re: [T2] Water Pump Wiring

The wire runs from the fusebox area, underneath the front mat, under the 
driver's seat, and then if you pull the spare tire out, you can see 
where it comes out and heads around the back of the cabinet.

&gt; Can someone tell me how to simplest wire up my water pump for the sink 
&gt; my 78 westy, Kermit? The hot wire pulled loose, and for the life of 
&gt; me, I can't find the other end..... I don't want to cut any more holes 
&gt; in the back of the cabinet searching.
