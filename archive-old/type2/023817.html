&lt;&lt; Question: is it by any means possible to replace this spring without 
pulling the engine ?? The engine was out just 600 Km ago. I would be very 
glad if I don't have to pull it again.
 Question 2: is it possible to tighten the upper row of head nut without 
pulling the engine ?
 Question 3:is it possible that I by any mistake when I had the engine out 
last time have caused this broken valve spring ? ( had the head of ). &gt;&gt;

1-yes  but be careful so the valve does not slide out into the cyl. chamber.
2-not a good idea to do only one row.
3-hmm. could be.  did you have all new parts on your head rebuild??
