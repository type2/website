&gt;I have a 1978 Bus in need of its window washer bottle.  However, would
&gt;it be easier and more convenient to replace the pneumatic system with
&gt;the now standard electric water pump?  This, of course, would require
&gt;a separate switch on the dash.

Indigo, my '77, had a PO retrofit the pump tank. Simply install any washer
pump inline from the tank to the point where the tubing splits off to each
side of the windshield. The switch is an average intermittant push button
style one, mounted in the dash (unfortunately). At least it looks OK, but
many people ask
&quot;What in the hell's that button?&quot; I tell them it's for the passenger
ejector seat :-)

BTW, wire that pump up right. The PO had it running off the 'Power Antenna'
lead from the radio. It took me a while to figure out why I had to have the
radio on the wash the windshield. I ended up finding a circuit (interior
lights) with little load and ran it off the fused side of the box. I never
use the thing, except in the winter. Colorado has a lot of road cr*p.

As for a new bottle, I think RMMW has them. For too much I'm sure.
Good luck!
