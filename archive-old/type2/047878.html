Subject: [T2] Re: Those Funky Little Knobs

Here's what I did on my 71 bus regarding the knobs you're talking about.
First I drilled out the plastic plugs that held the levers in. Didn't have
a good tool for removing them and the great and all powerful list has
stated on many occassions that the metal spring tabs apply more than enough
force to hold them in. Plus, you can pull them right out if you ned to open
the dash. Next, I cleaned them as best as I could, especially the metal
that might still show. I then went to Lowes and got a couple of cans of
Plasticote in Red and Blue. This is the stuff that you can dip tool handles
in to insulate them and provide grip. Took my levers and dipped the faded,
plastic ends in the mix, pulled them out and rotated and twirled them to
get an even coat with no runs or obvious thick spots. I then took some
straight card stock and carefully scraped the soft excess from the metal
part of the handles. Finished product looks EXCELLENT!!! My original knobs
were red and I think green. They are now red and blue and look like a
factory rubber finish. Cheap and easy dress up fix. Hope this is usefull
cause God knows I don't often have much to contribute. Down the road, I'll
let you know how the power windows and air conditioning work out:--&gt;
