Subject: Turn Signal Tale of Woe

Greetings Type2ers,

It's my first time to post, so I searched the archive consulted the tech articles
and did additonal research with no luck, so here's the question....

The turn signal switch for my 69 Westy won't &quot;hold&quot;, I have to manually
turn the 
signal on and off, no good for my state inspector.  I feel like I have exhausted
all parts resources, and was wondering if any one has a source for a new part?

Next question,  Has anyone modified a switch from another year to work on their
69 bus?   Looking for any advice, suggestions, or &quot;that happened to me and 
I did this.....type of scenarios.

Thanks!

Shelley
69 Westy &quot;Puff&quot;
