Subject: PEI RUN

So .... is there interest out there in this sort of thing?  I plan on going
to the East Coast again this summer - I won't have much more than a week I
suspect.  I thinking about maybe just heading to PEI - Cape Breton would be
cool - but I don't think I'll have the time.  I figure it's about 15 hours
of driving for me. A Carabus would be cool - but, no doubt, tough to
organize.  A campout for a weekend in some park or campground might be an
easier thing to arrange. I'm thinking about August - but I'm flexible.  I
bet a posting on the Type2 list or VB list might produce some interest -
there are a few east coasters ;) on those lists and there are members form
the NE US.

Maybe call it - the Lobster Run - or ... I dunno - maybe cook a ton of clams
on the beach somewhere.  PEI is very cool - although I haven't been there in
a mighty long time.

hmmmmm - any interest -
