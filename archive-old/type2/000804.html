Sounds like fuel pump to me.  I ran my '72 for the longest time this way
before I figured it out.  Those were the exact symptoms.  It never happened
around town so I rarely had to deal with it.  That gave me a false sense
that everything was alright.  When it finally did do it in town, it left me
in the street.  I pulled the fuel line at the carb and had a passing bug
driver turn the engine over for me.  Nada.  So my new air-cooled friend
drove me to the FLVWAPS, picked up parts, and took me back to my bus.  Try
getting that kind of service from fellow motorists if you happen to be
driving a F*rd!!

Later,

&lt;&lt; Should I be worried about the following.....
 	I was cruising along doing 55mph when I started to climb a long hill.
 	As the car slowed, I applied more pressure to the accelerator, but power
 just seemed to fall away. I geared down into 3rd to pick it up again, but
it
 just kept dropping away even though I had my foot flat out on the pedal.
 	I pulled off, kept her running, and went back to listen to the
engine...all
 sounded fine. I limped back onto the motorway, thinking of all the possible
 problems, when....as suddenly as it had happened, it went away, and I
 climbed back up to the 50's.....now I can't stop worrying about it.
 	Is it a clutch thing, or was I just putting to much on the gas ??
 ...any thoughts/help would be appreciated.
