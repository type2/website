&gt; Ever hear of induction? Go to Monkey Wards appliance dept. and ask for a demo of
&gt; the inductive cooktop of one of their newer stoves. You won't see anything move
&gt; (ie, no friction) until the pot starts to boil over. The alternator/generator
&gt; gets hot because it's generating power. Run it with all the wires disconnected
&gt; and a good ways away from a hot VW air-cooled engine and it won't get so hot.

Actually there is alot of friction in electrical appliances.  It doesn't
come from moving parts, however.  It is the friction inside the wiring,
all those electrons cruising around in there.  That's why your stereo gets
hot when it's on for a long time, and why you should always use the
correct guage in wiring, or the wire will melt from too much friction.
