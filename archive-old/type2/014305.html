&gt; I recommend you REPLACE the torsion bars. They are only $100 from RMMW. If
&gt; you try to adjust them they frequently break after the adjustment.

Such has not been my experience.  The only broken bars I have seen were
the result either of off-road abuse or of bars being switched from one
side to the other.

If you use new bars, you will likely have to adjust them twice, once on
installation, and once after they take a set.  the settings in the
Bentley manual are for used bars.
