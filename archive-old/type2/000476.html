The 'brotherhood' that poured out for Steve was really something. To some
degree it's kind of expected since you own a van and all. I make a point to
stop and lend a hand if I can when I see a fellow bus driver break down. And
the idea for the rescue squad is great in concept. However I would have to
agree with some of the other list members; I could see how someone could
abuse the 'privilege' and expect to be compensated. Maybe it's just my
cynical side, but if this happens the brotherhood will likely breakdown and
there could be some fallout between members which no one would want. To keep
this from happening there definitely have to be some rules for this to work.
I hate rules, but sometimes they are necessary. In short, although I am a
new member, I value this list deeply and I don't want to see it's demise.

Someone earlier in the thread suggested that maybe this could be handled
like insurance. I think that's a great idea, but I'm not sure you could
afford the policy and Lloyds may be the only company who would pick it up.
At what price? If there are any insurance types out there, is this out of
the question? It almost sounds like a REALLY cool extended warrantee for
Volks folks. Maybe we could handle it like insurance ourselves. You could
subscribe to the policy based on current engine replacement price. Miles
&gt;from home to work if used on a daily basis. Overall vehicle miles,
deductible amount and level of coverage. This would in turn determine the
monthly 'insurance' fee. In addistion A board of elected list members could
act like a collective ombudsman helping to settle disputes between companies
like GEX or Midas, etc if things aren't right where a subscribing member is
concerned.

The thing is different people are going to have different needs. The value
&gt;from this depends on all kinds of things. I for example use my van as a
daily driver and put 60 miles per day on it commuting. I put a lot of time,
effort into my van, not to mention 45k miles a year. I know I'm going to
need to swap heads pretty soon because I'm loosing compression in one
cylinder. I've been through this a few times before. I wouldn't think of
going on a trip right now because I know I need to give it some TLC to make
it right again. If there was some insurance I could cash in on to help with
the burden of cost, maybe I could get the work done and THEN go on the trip.
I could then feel like I expect the compensation and no one should feel
slighted by the request. Please understand this is in no way a dig to
Steve - I think what happened here was fantastic, but when it becomes
expected and there aren't clear guidelines, things may change.

I don't go on a trip anywhere expecting trouble because I try to make sure
that my van is in good running condition before I left for where ever I am
going. But if I had everything in order and it still conked out on me, well,
this is where the brotherhood from the list really goes to work. The feeling
of good will, helping a fellow stranded bus pilot, and most likely someone
you may have never even met before. Developing a new friend, giving a hand
when it is much needed. This makes the heart feel good. You don't need
compensation for this kind of help. And everything stays that way if there
is an 'insurance policy' in place to help with the monetary end of it.

By the rules set forth earlier I would have roughly 11 months to wait before
I could be considered, but I'll be there to help if I can. You could park
you van in front of my house for say up to two weeks while you get it
running. And I seem to have nearly all the tools necessary to get the job
done. Accomidations at the house are out since space is kinda tight already
anyhow.

I admitidly haven't looked through the archives to see if this idea may have
been brought up before but I would like to see a window sticker maybe in the
form of a hyperlink, say blue writing on a white background, that said
http://www.type2_dot_com or maybe just www.type2_dot_com about two inches by six
inches with stickum on the letter side so you can put in in the rear/side
window without it being exposed to the elements. Easy identification of
fellow list members!

Thanks for putting up with my ramblings, long though they may be!
