Subject: Need help starting 81

Last night I rewired the radio connection attempting to use the buzzer
circuit in order to have the radio work when I put the key in the switch.  I
actually removed the buzzer s which hadn't worked since I've had the car and
and straight wired those two wires and then spliced in the radio hot below
the ignition switch.That worked for about a second then failed and I couldn't
get it work again in that fashion. I left the buzzer wire unconnected and
rewired the radio to the constant hot. As I recall, at least twice I started
the engine ok but I don't know when it was in this process. .

Now this morning I go to start the car and It will fire quickly and easily
but quit within a second and maybe backfire. I have to assume that my
monkeying with the radio/wiring is the cause of this. Anyone have some
suggestions as to what may have happened or how to troubleshoot my way out of
this? Naturally I intended to take the kids camping tonight.

I'm on digest so if responding please mail direct.

Thanks,

Weston
