I just want to say thank you  for the inspiration help and wisdom that
everyone has offered me. The bus was seemingly in bad shape and I had no
clue where to start, ya'll tried to point and finally I took it to the
mech. BUT there are things I asked about that I'm gonna fix
myself(odometer) and start small ya know. I just wanted to say thanks.
and I got questions as always....

What is the wolfsburg  edition?

how hard would it be too put a pop top on my bus?
and a folding bed?where can I get these things?

what are those plastic things at the end of your bumpers called?

what is the panel that your gas cap(filler hose) called?( I dented mine
last yr. pulling out of a parking garage in Baltimore.)-- 

again thank you and think of all the good energy being put out by me on
thursday everyone needs a charge every once in a while... *
