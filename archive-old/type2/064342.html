&gt; Last spring, I put a rebuilt starter/solenoid into the 1971 engine on my
&gt; 1970 bus.  Two days ago, the thing began sticking.  Sometimes I had to hit
&gt; the key three or four times, sometimes it started right off--and sometimes
&gt; it just wouldn't play ball.  Nothing I couldn't fix by whacking it sharply
&gt; with a 15&quot; length of wooden clothes rod, but doing that downtown on
&gt; Broadway in a coat and tie is undignified. 

Apparently, this is a problem regardless of how new your starter and
solenoid are.  I had a similar problem on my '77 Westy, and rather than
replace the starter and solenoid, I was advised to install an ignition
relay.  There's been alot of talk about it recently on the type2 list;
Bosch makes a kit to do this.  

I used a replacement Chrysler ignition relay.  Rather than send juice
up the thin wire from the battery to the ignition switch and back down
to the solenoid, the thin wire runs back down to the relay (much less
power to operate than the solenoid), and the relay sends the full fury
of the battery into the solenoid.  Hasn't stuck again since!

I can send you details on the installation if you're interested...

        TTFN &amp; Good Luck
