Subject: Synthetic oil: when is it OK to switch?  (new engine)

'71 Bus with new Mexican T1 engine, running frequently-changed straight
30-weight dino oil for break-in.  After how many miles is it safe to
switch to 20W50 synthetic?  I've searched the archives and amazingly, it
seems that this particular detail hasn't been discussed much.  (to head
off unnecessary comments: yes, I have a filter, and no, I do not want to
discuss the relative merits of different brands, weights, or
compositions of oil.  i just want an educated opinion as to when it's
safe to switch from dino to synthetic on a brand-new engine.)
 
Thanks
 
- Miles
