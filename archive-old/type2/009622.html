On the subject of wheel bearings not fitting, Harmon Seaver wrote:

List,
Harmon, your bearings might have fit using this method or you may have tried
it and just had the wrong bearing, but i wanted to FYI this anyway. Also - i
know you codgers have probly been doing this for years. 

Newbies replacing and pressed-in or on wheel bearings:
I recently replaced the front wheel bearings in my 1983 4X4 T_at_yota Terc_at_l.
This is a full-time front wheel drive car.  The inner bearing race had to be
cut off the axle and the outer race had to be pressed/hammered out of the
bearing housing.  I ruined a Taiwan-made 1&amp;3/4&quot; 3/4&quot; drive socket doing this.
Father-in-law frowned. Oh well. He does that. His garage, etc...
Anyway, when installing the new inner race onto the axle, i froze the axle and
heated the race (blow torch).  Dropped on like a new wedding ring, came to
temperature and was immovable.  When installing the new outer race, i  heated
the bearing housing and froze the outer race.  Was able to lightly tap the
race in with an appropriate driving tool.  Again - came to temperature and was
immovable. *Very* little work in comparison to removal. I haven't been into
the bearing on my bus, but I'd say bearings, races and axles are pretty common
to most vehicles - including the bus so this should be a valid post.
It is a great feeling when you learn from your mistakes.
Even greater whe you can learn from someone else's!
G*d bless this list!
