Subject: Re: [T2] T2-T3 parts interchangability

Back to the original question, the Vanagon tranny is too hard to adapt
to a bus because of the side mount shifter. Motor is good and often
used in buses.

 I was wondering whether the motor and transmission (manual) are
interchangable?
 I have never had a T3, so don't know how different thay are,
especially the trans.
 I am aware the T3 motor will have different EFI and exhaust (square exhaust
 ports), and tinware, but is the rest the same?
