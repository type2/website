Subject: Re: [T2] Bringing the Bus home.

Blake,

Don't take it too bad,  You get to get rid of some stuff, clean some stuff 
and then put the proper sheet metal back on the engine.

At that point, it might last ok enough for some time.  The biggest deal is 
to get rid of the junk and make it cool again.

Heat is the **major** enemy of the VW engine and recirculating hot air
from anywhere into the engine is **always** bad.

Stick with the list and we will get you through it.

Sit and just look at your engine, identify what is what and whether it 
really looks right from an engineering stand point.  Seeing the ground or 
outside the engine compartment thru the bottom or around the engine means 
recirculating hot air...therefore your cooling problems.

Find pics or someone with one done right and park next to them and 
look...or take pics of yours and go look for pics on the net of what it is 
supposed to look like.  Compare....take your time.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Argh, this doesn't sound encouraging at all. I'm so excited about the 
&gt; prospects for this bus, but I also don't want it to become a money pit. 
&gt; I bought this in hopes of cleaning it up to become my daily driver. 

&gt; What kind of precautions can I take that will help to keep this bus on 
&gt; the road? It only cost me 1800 so I knew I would have to put some more 
&gt; cash into it, but I wasn't expecting to replace the engine.
