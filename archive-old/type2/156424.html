Subject: FI ground connector needed

Does anyone have a source for the ground connector for an FI bus that fits under the plenum and is bolted to the engine?   I believe it has 2 or 3 male spades coming off of it for the FI harness ground wires to hook to.  I've looked everyone locally and on the www to no avail. thanks, Greg
