Listees, 

I was told by someone on the list, I think Jay, a while back that there is a guy in Waldorf, MD, Joe Cooper, I think his name was, who knows a lot about old Veedubs and does some side work. Anyone know how I can get in touch with him? If not, anyone have any other recommendations. The guy I took my bus to to get the vavles adjusted didnt adjust my timing and left me with an oil leak, I'm not going back to him.


Thanks all, 
Melissa
