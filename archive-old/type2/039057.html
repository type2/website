Muir needed time to roll his cigarette--it's no longer PC to smoke.

Aside from that, my philosophy is the engine will warm up faster if you
follow the instructions VW gives you--remember, Muir lived in the desert...
An engine will have less carbon build-up if run hotter (but not too hot),
less carbon build up is a good thing.  Carbon build up can lead to sticking
valves, blocked pre-heat tubes, and more crap in your motor oil.

Don't worry about babying your Bus, when you try to drive on the highway
after the breaking in of the motor, you'll find when you're around any hill
steeper than a curb cut that you never have enough power.  There's a
fine line between use and abuse.

Love it, care for it, but drive it.

&gt;I hope you folks aren't getting tired of my &quot;newbie simple questions&quot;, but
I
&gt;have another one. I thought I remembered reading in Muir's book about
&gt;allowing the time during warmup for it to get sufficiently warm before
&gt;putting it in gear, and I looked around and there it was on page 36. Last
&gt;night I'm reading the original owner's manual for my &quot;new to me&quot; 70'
&gt;Dormobile, and it says&quot;Do not try to warm the engine up by letting it idle
&gt;with the vehicle stationary- drive off straight away&quot;. What gives? I will
&gt;pick up the bus on Friday with a new 1600 cc engine, and I want to learn it
&gt;and baby it, but this is confusing. It ought to be a simple thing it seems,
&gt;but what should I do?
