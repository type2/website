&gt;Has anyone ever used one of those evaporative coolers that clamp in the passenger window in a type 2? I realize they mostly need low humidity to work well.

FWIW, I don't think my proposed &quot;ice rack&quot; method is a swamp/evaporative cooler.  More like a chiller, passing the air throough the rapidly-melting ice and making it 
colder and wetter.  The entropic path is long and convoluted, running from my employer through my paycheck to the 7-11's cash register and thence to the power 
company and eventually dead dinosaurs of some sort, with a side branch that runs to the front of the bus.  Ultimately, ANY air chilling function like this results in 
increased entropy somewhere -- the heat don't disappear, it just goes someplace else.

But then, in my theology, entropy IS god, so I figure I'm on a holy mission every time I crank up the AC.
