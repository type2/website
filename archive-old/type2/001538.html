I've put a couple of pics of these bolts in question showing the bolt and
washer.  The top of the bolts are marked KAMAX 8.8.

It almost looks like the bracket is allowed to slide forward out of these
bolts when body momentum pushes on the column .  The bracket has slots with
open ends facing the driver (see my pics on the &quot;tutorial&quot;)

&gt; The true shear bolts hold the column to the body. They are part # 211 415
&gt; 549 and were used from vin #214 2164 060.
&gt; The bolt Brad removed is a tamper proof bolt to hold the steering lock to
&gt; the column to slow down thieves and has nothing to do with collapsing in
an
&gt; accident.
&gt; When you get in an accident and you run into something in front of you,
your
&gt; momentum and your body pushes the column forward. The shear bolts holding
&gt; the column to the body shear and the column moves forward.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;shoulder. It is designed to shear the head off when you tighten it,
&gt; making
&gt; &gt; &gt;it 'tamper-proof'. It is not really soft, it just has a designed weak
&gt; spot.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Is the tamper proof bolt really
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a shear bolt? Is that why it's so soft?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; NO, the point of these bolts is NOT to be tamper proof.  Bill assumes
&gt; &gt; correctly, those bolts are designed to shear at a particular torque to
&gt; &gt; provide a particular clamping force.  They are not &quot;soft&quot; per say, just
&gt; &gt; turned down like they are they carry a very accurate torque and shear.
&gt; &gt; Prior to their &quot;invention&quot; the column was suspended with a number of
&gt; &gt; nylon washers and the bolts had very narrow torque specifications
&gt; &gt; (this in '73ish era I think with the one year? column support.)  With
the
&gt; &gt; invention of the shear bolts all those stupid washers that had to be
&gt; &gt; in all the correct locations with correctly torqued bolts ceased.  Those
&gt; &gt; bolts are integral to how and when your column collapses in a front
&gt; &gt; impact and need to be replaced with the correct parts, furthermore they
&gt; &gt; are available and are cheap.  I think RMMW even has the things for
&gt; &gt; nothing essentially.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; USE THE RIGHT PARTS.  You got very little in front of you and you
&gt; &gt; don't want a steering wheel as part of your chest.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sorry I've meant to nip this one before when people asked, can I just
&gt; &gt; use a....
