It's already happened with BMW motorcycles.  Check out

Unfortunately, the same isn't really feasable with automobiles, as they
have to meet safety and emission standards, even if imported as &quot;kits&quot;.

Malcolm Bricklin is currently working on a deal to import ZMW vehicles
from what was Yugoslavia.  See:

Automobiles.  Yugoslavia.  I can hardly wait  :?
