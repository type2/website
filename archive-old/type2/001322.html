Subject: Upper ball joint removal from 73 bus

Hello,
I removed the steering knuckle, but the upper ball joint remained attached
to the upper torsion arm.  I loosened the torsion arm, but it seems to be
under a lot of pressure, so I left it there.  I tried to slam the ball joint
out where it is, but it will not budge.

I consulted the Bentley, and not a lot of help here.

TIA
