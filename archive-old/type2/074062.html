Subject: Re: [T2] Re: New Pistons ?

Okay - you guys have wetted my appetite - what type of cam specs let you 
run these high CR's?

Does this apply to any engine - say a Corvair or Porsche 911 engine - or is 
this VW only cam spec?

I realize that if I was an engine engineer then this would be a simple 
answer but until now I thought of myself as knowing a FEW things. This is 
all new to me. Thought a higher CR was guaranteed to lead to problems and a 
low CR (within reason) was the Holy Grail.

Any suggested reading? You've really got my attention now!

Ciao!
