&gt;i had planned on starting with the seals and seeing if there was anything else that looked like it needed replacing. what should i be on the lookout for to tell if i need to do a rebuild?

Well you have to ask yourself why the seals &quot;blew&quot;.  It might be because you have excessive blowby from worn rings.  I'd start with a compression test and leakdown test.  Replacing all of those seals is a lot of work that will be wasted if they just blow out again in a few days.
