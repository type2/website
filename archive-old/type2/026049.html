Stockton, Andrew sends:

&gt; 
&gt; $800?????
&gt; Let's not make the neophytes nervous.  All you need is a 1-13/16&quot;
&gt; socket.  3/4&quot; drive is adequate.  Add to that an eighteen inch 3/4&quot;
&gt; drive T-bar and you have everything you need.  Maybe some scrap pipe
&gt; for some extra lever arm.
&gt; 
&gt; I bought mine at Sears fifteen years ago.  Probably cost less than
&gt; $30.  With all the import stuff out there, you could probably do
&gt; better than that today.  I never had to use any violence to remove
&gt; the big nut.  Just stand on the end of the T-bar, grab on the the
&gt; body and pull. I weigh about 175 pounds.  No hitting with the sledge
&gt; hammer required.

I bought a 3/4&quot; drive socket set at a flea market for $37.50. Not super
quality, but it does get those high-torque nuts, bolts and screws off. Works
good for tearing out walls in Butler buildings and removing heating elements
from water heaters, too.

I am a Tool Collector of the first order, and not even I want an $800 socket
set.
