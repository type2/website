Subject: Re: [T2] Need help replacing a push rod tube

Take a pair of channel lock pliers and brace them against the engine
block and pull your tubes out.
After  you get them out they may be a little bit crushed. Take a 3/8&quot;
extension with a proper sized socket on the end and drive it through the
tube to get the compression out. Examine the ends of the tube and make
sure that they are in good  shape.
When you put the new O rings on they will hang going into the head. Use a
screwdriver to push the top portion of the O ring down and it will slip
right in. Use oil on the O rings to make them go in easier. I use a 15mm
socket on an extension to give me control over the angle and guide the
tube in.

Clean all residue of silicone, dirt, grease out of the O ring seating
areas on both the head and the block.
O rings don't need any other sealer if they are on a clean mating
surface. They could leak a little for the first fifteen minutes that you
run your engine.

 Is it just stuck or am I missing a step or
