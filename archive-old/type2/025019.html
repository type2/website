Whew, finally! After getting pushed back by the larger, high-dollar orders, the
list shirts are finally done! I just picked them up at the printer today, and
they are really great! I'm going out of town this weekend, but as soon as I get
back Tuesday, I'll start getting them in the mail. They should all be out by
the end of next week, except for the tie-dye ones, which will take another week
or two to get out.
Many thanks to all of you who ordered, and I apologize for the delay. I think
you'll be pleased, though, once you get them.
Thanks again!
:)
