Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Fuel Injector Bolt

You said:

&quot;Finished up the last injector, put it back in the hole,
line up the ring, put the nut on, tighten it down....  and the bolt pops
out of its hole.  Hmmm...&quot;

Since you were TIGHTENING the nut, you probably did not shear the stud.

If you are talking about a bolt, then Bob's advice holds.  And if you want 
to test the lengths of the bolts, simply take one of the bolts off one of 
the other injectors.

If you are talking about a stud, you probably did not shear it off and then 
you might want to use some lock-tite stuff
