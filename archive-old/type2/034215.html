Subject: Re: CFM Carb ratings.

&gt; What type of exhaust are you running?

Sorry, I forgot to include that little tidbit. I have an EMPI extractor,
y'know the one that bolts to the header in the center and exits on the
passenger side of the bus. Some locals I've talked to said this pipe should
present no problem for 1915cc's, even up to past 6000rpm.

I like the feedback so far... an 1835 w/34-PICT-3 that goes to 6000RPM
should tell me the carb is not the problem after all. I can't fathom that
Scat would make a new cam (the 4061) that would lay down at 4K, though this
particular cam does give me a powerband from just above idle (any
experiences with this cam?).

So I'm left with the valve/head suggestions. Does it sound reasonable that
the stock valve sizes would not support 1915cc's at &gt; 4400rpm?

Oh yes. I've heard nothing about CFM ratings. Technically, I would imagine
that Bore squared times Stroke, times 3.141592653589793238462643383279, do
something with 2.54, and multiply by RPM would tell you how much CFM your
engine needs at what RPM. So why aren't these Euro-carbs rated with this
important info? And yes, that is pi to the 30th. I was a bored child in 8th
grade math class.

Thanks agin'
