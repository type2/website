&gt; &gt; Tomorrow, we try a 3 mile round trip to the store...
&gt;
&gt; Not bad, he did fine...
&gt;
&gt; Except for the clutch.  One the way down, I was able to shift from 1st
&gt; through 3rd okay (35 mph speed limit).  A little stiff, but it worked.  But
&gt; after about 6-7 minutes, I had a devil of a time shifting in and out of
&gt; gear.  Like the clutch would work.  I could shift into gear with the bus
&gt; off, and I could shift from 1st to 2nd to 4th while driving if I was very,
&gt; very careful.
&gt;
&gt; The PO mentioned something about this, and that it's not the clutch itself
&gt; but something to do with the cable.  Now, I don't have a problem with buying
&gt; a new cable, but frankly, I'm currently low on cash.  I plan on getting
&gt; under there and seeing if there's any damage, etc., but was wondering if
&gt; maybe it just needs to be adjusted.

If it is that far out that fast, there is no substitute for a new cable.
If you adjust the old one, you will just give yourself another couple of
days at most before it breaks.

Also, if you take it out now, you have the option of taping a piece of
string to the old cable to help pull the new cable through the tube.
Pulling is much easier than pushing!

Don't forget to liberally grease the new cable while putting it in.
Lotsa grease, have a good 'ol time!

Despite your cash woes, try to buy a second cable right now.  Having a
spare will turn a major roadtrip problem into a minor annoyance.  Get a
throttle cable too.  They aren't that expensive.
