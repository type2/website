I can't tell if you are being sarcastic or literal. Their catalog isnt 
small. And their service is excellent. When I restored my 67 bus, they
bent over backwards to help out when I had emergencies and needed parts
ASAP, or services such as letting me go into their shop to assemble the
dreaded wing-vent windows.
Twice they shipped parts for free and told me to pay later.
 
Anyway, I'm a satisfied customer.
 
I also deal with Vintage Parts in Burbank. Bev and Shawn
are also very friendly too.
