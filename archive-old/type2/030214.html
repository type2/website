&gt; not many people are aware that the belts for generator and alternator

&gt; belt as a &quot;one fits all&quot; product.

How could it be?  The pulleys are the same (I used the generator pulley on
the alternator) and the center-center spacing is the same.  What is the
size of the alternator belt?

The difference between the alternator and generator stand is that the
alternator stand has additional clearance for the &quot;fat&quot; rear (RIR) end of
the alternator.  I believe that you could even use an alternator stand to
mount a generator (although I haven't investigated it completely)
