Subject: clutch, 78

On my 78 bus, 1st gear engages easier if the bus is rolling forward at
1-2 mph.  Sometimes I can barely force it into 1st if the bus is
stopped, but let my foot off the brake and let it roll a little (I
always try to park facing downhill), and it'll slide right in like
silk.  The other gears, especially 2 and R, are a little notchy but
not bad.  Can anyone explain this?

Also, in Bentley (Fig 3-10 I think in my copy), there's a picture
related to reinstalling the engine, something about the bearer bar
being parallel to the front (FIF) of the fan housing... How important
is that spacing?  What symptoms might exist if it's wrong?

Other clutch/tranny probs at the moment: gravelly sound when
depressing clutch &amp; letting clutch out, not as noticable if fully
dis/engaged; occaisional massive shudder back through gearshift on
bumps; left-side engine bearer bolts were loose when purchased (but I
tightened them down as soon as I discovered the prob).

Thanks muchly,
Rodney
