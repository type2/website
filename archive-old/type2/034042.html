Subject: Re: gas lines

Monica, I doubt the leaking gas line would be your problem, as the fuel
injection systems are pressurized to 35 psi. If the leaking gas line were
within the FI fuel ring, you'd be squirting some serious gas out. Since
it's not within the fuel ring, it isn't a variable. However, is it possible
that you have a clogged fuel filter which is keeping your fuel pump from
getting enough fuel?

Another possibility, I think, is a vacuum leak, including a leak in the
brake booster lines or even the brake booster diaphram itself. If you have
such a leak, you will be able to run your bus until it warms up; then it
will cut out and not let you accelerate. (That's the condition on my bus
right now.) 

I would recommend plugging the brake booster line and seeing if your
problem persists. You have to plug that line perfectly, or you'll still
have a leak. IMHO, the best way to do this is with a waxed cork or rubber
stopper of appropriate diameter placed where the booster line hooks into
the plenum over the center of the engine. If it's like my '77 engine, it
connects with another vacuum line right onto the big air exchange box in
the center (don't know what that's called.

Hope this helps!

Joe
