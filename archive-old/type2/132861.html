Subject: CV bolt not Torx!

Chris,

I think you might know this but may be just a matter of nomenclature, the
bus funky allen bolt is actually a &quot;triple square&quot; which is not the same as
a torx.

You are right, the socket is the way to go!!!  One of these days I will have
all the same bolts, right now I am mixed up between the 2 kinds.

best,
Will A.

Went to Sears and bought a socket with an allen head on the end (plan to go
back for the torx head too) that fits my axle bolts. DUH! Should have bought
one YEARS ago. $6 or so. Pick you source.

MUCH easier than the old allen or Torx wrench I had been using for about 10
years... My knuckles are MUCH happier.
