John, I am very happy with my $30 model from Campmor.  1-800-CAMPMOR. 
It is basically a bucket within a bucket, an inner lid, a seat and an 
outer lid.  It fits under my rear facing seat and sticks up about half
an inch.  I can wedge the lid on the seat and get it to stay.  If I 
were heading off road I would bungie cord the bus seat lid down.  I 
packed spare parts and rags around it and it didn't go anywhere on a 
4,200 mile trip to Oregon.  It did not smell.  There is a chemical out
there that turns the solution to a gel so it can't slosh or spill 
easily.  I used a similar chemical that didn't smell but it didn't do 
the gel thing.  Anyone have the name of the gel type maker?  I lined 
it with two trash bags, making cleanup 
a snap.  Yes, they are a VERY good alternative to finding a restroom 
in the wild, or even the interstate.  I wouldn't travel without it 
now.  Let me know if you have any more questions.  Jim
