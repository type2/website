Subject: CHT sensor location

Was quoth:

 &gt; The number 3 plug is the preffered location, but I have always had 
trouble
 &gt; getting the plug in without mangling the ring (dual port, upright 
motor.)
 &gt;My next engine uses 12mm x 3/4&quot; reach plugs and I was wondering where 
a suitable
 &gt; alternative would be for the CHT sensor mount? Under the washer next 
to the
 &gt; head stud by the #3 intake port?

I mounted the sender under the nut for the cylinder head stud nearest 
the #3 spark plug,  but the sender failed after about 2 years (metal 
fatigue?)  The only way to fix it is to pull the engine.

 &gt; Thought about under the washer for the #3
 &gt; exhaust port stud, but was afraid the exhaust gas temps would give me
 &gt; unrealistically high head temp numbers. Any other suggestions?
Tim

I had a bolt welded onto the #3 exhaust manifold so that I could thread 
a nut onto it.  I put the sender there.  It has failed again, but this 
time it was an easy fix.  It seems that with the dissimilar metals and 
the dialectric thereby created (and the wildly fluctuating 
temperatures), that corrosion sets in fairly readily.  It fails where 
the metal ring clamps on.  I have fixed it by opening the crimp, 
cutting the wires so that they are the same length, and then 
recrimping.  It throws the calibration off a little bit but you are not 
so much concerned with absolute values as you are concerned with 
trends.  I have found that the temperature there at the manifold is 
probably about 50 degrees higher than under the cylinder head stud 
nearest the #3 spark plug.  Of course, as always, your milage may vary.
