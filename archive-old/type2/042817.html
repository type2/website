Subject: Re: Sump Oil Temp Sender

Ok,
back to the 1600 engine. The VDO instructions suggest the sender not be used
as a drain plug, but that a second hole be drilled into the sump plate. I
didn't bother to drill, given that the drain plug solution seems so easy,
but I am still baffled about the interference with the (unmodified) oil
screen. I don't see how following the instructions would have helped,
either. Yes, the sender is slightly longer than the original drain plug, but
it's the right part number.

Regarding oil: as Jim and many others claim, synthetic oil, at least as of a
few years ago, is an even worse coolant than regular oil. IF this is indeed
true, then my intuition tells me that synthetic oil should take longer to
warm up, while the rest of the engine is *hotter*, hence the lower gauge
readings would be misleading.  I SUSPECT (and I invite physicists to confirm
or correct) that on longer trips, once oil has had time to fully warm up, it
will be hotter than conventional oil, reflecting the higher temperature of
the case. (Then again, some of this may be offset by reduced friction if
synthetics are indeed a better lubricant.)  My point is that readings are
inherently ambiguous, depending not only on where and what you're reading,
but also when. I conclude that the best way to test oils is not in the
engine, but on the stove top (when my wife is away :).

Old FART: Sender Location

David is absolutely correct when he says that the tip of the dipstick-style
sender is at the same location as the tip of the sump-mounted sender. This
is only true for the T4 engine, though. And there's more to the sender than
just its tip: the bottom of the sump-mounted sender is in contact with both
the case and a stream of cooling air. On the Porsche 914, the sump plate
actually has a recess for the sender, thus keeping it out of harm's way and,
I believe, shaded from the air stream. As for the T1 engine, if the
sump-mounted sender is tucked under the oil screen, then it's no surprise if
it's slow to react to oil temperature changes. I'm intrigued by John
&quot;aircooled_dot_net&quot; Connolly's suggestion to place the sender at the end of the
main oil galley, which is the way it's done on the 911 engine (the only
difference being that unlike the 911, it would read the temperature _before_
the oil cooler.
