Subject: Re: Splittie Steering Wheel Lock

 I found a sterring 
wheel lock on  a bus in the wreckers but don't want to go to 
 all the hassle to remove the entire steering column.

you must remove the lock mechanism AND the steering column and switch them
into your bus to have the lock work.   Sorry.    I hope it comes with a key.
 what year is the bus in the junkyard?   Does it have writing (fahrt start
etc.) where the key goes in?

You will also want the plastic plug that covers the hole where the ig switch
usually is, and the plate that holds the column firmly to the dash, as well
as the rubber grommet in it.

The bolts that holding the steering box to the bus usually have oil on them
and are not too bad to remove.
