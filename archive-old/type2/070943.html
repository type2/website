this really is a stupid question..but i am still unable to load web pages 
(hence i have not checked the archives about this subject)
i tried to adjust my brakes today.....going along with my muir book.....i 
follow everything but am unable to located the stars.....i think i might have 
located the stars but when i tried to adjust them with a screwdriver i 
thought for sure that it was about to break in two......i think i might be 
better off just buying a whole new brake system......but i was wondering if 
someone out there had some advice for me to follow so that i might be able to 
drive on the brakes i have.....
i appologize for this newbie question......
this bus has been sitting for about a year now..._dot_can something be frozen? 
wheels turn......brakes work somewhat....i drove it home
thanks in advance
skye
