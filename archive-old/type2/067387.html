&quot;One, the companies or research companies claim that the new gas in 
California affects only a very small portion of the cars in use as far as 
eroding seals or gas rubber lines.  I disagree. Nissan is in the middle 
of a huge recall with all their cars because of a number of gas fires 
related to leaking injectors. Nissan's customer service across the board 
has been less than exemplary and costing its customers lots of time, etc. 
The recall was voluntary, but I think they feard a lawsuit. This is all 
stuff I heard from the Z car mailing list. Also, there is a noted 
increase in engine fires across the board and that has been noted in the 
web page related to Smog Check II in California (Search on KSFO and Smog 
check II to find the server). &quot;

Nissan is not the only manufacturer to recall for this, I believe that  BMW
has recalled all it's cars back throught the 1989 model year for the same
reasons.
