Hi Everybody,
   I recently aquired a BN2 gas heater.  The fan runs, the glow plug gets 
red hot, and the fuel pump is making pressure and causes a nice stream from 
the fuel jet, with the jet removed from the heater.  Problem is, that the 
darn thing doesn't light off.
   With the glow plug screwed out, I can see that there is some sort of fine 
mesh screen between the fuel jet and the glow plug.  The fuel is hitting 
this screen and running down into the combustion tube.  I suspect the stream 
of fuel should pass through the screen and turn into a mist to be ignited.  
I'm thinking that the mesh is clogged, or the pump pressure is too low to 
force the fuel through the screen.
   Anyway, I'm looking for servicing and repair information on this BN2.  If 
you have a manual that you'd sell or copy, or if you know of an on-lone 
site, please let me know.  I promised the wife heat in her bus, and now I 
have to make it happen.
