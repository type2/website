Subject: Won't Start

Hi Volks!

Just a quick question.  Maybe not, a question nonetheless.  I drove my 1970 
Type II 1600cc superbeetle engine on a trip for about an hour at freeway 
speeds(as I say that, I mean 55.)  I stop to get gas, and find that when I 
try to restart, it won't.  I push it into a parking space to let it cool 
down.  I try again 30 min later the ignition goes click.  I figure ok, so i 
climb under the bus and check the starter with the insulated screwdriver.  
It whirrs to life.  Ok that's not a problem.  I try to start the bus with 
the key again.  Nothing.  I try to pop-the-clutch.. nothing.  It gets worse. 
  I climb down to inspect the engine.  Apparently the bolts that attach the 
engine mount to the engine were/are either sheared off or missing.  I look 
at the battery and it seems to be going bad.  I have headlights still.

Oh yah.. are is there any insight as to how to get the remainder of the 
engine mount bolts out of the case?

I guess i'm asking a lot, any help would be great!
The bus is now at my folks house up in the desert while i'm driving my dad's 
dodge ram truck with a v6 cummins turbo diesel... it's kinda fun, but it's 
not my bus

Thanks,
Rick
