My '78 has the same indicator.  However, there is no way to &quot;push&quot; the light and turn it on.
However, as my light was eternally extinguished, I pulled it from the dash and traced its
control to the parking brake.  Thus in theory, I propose the light comes on when the parking
brake is engaged.  Further disection of the light assembly reveal a few resistors, a transistor
and a bulb.  Makes sense.  I am now at the point of determining the point of failure (is the
transistor blown, the switch bad, or was it not getting power.)  As soon as I get time to track
the problem, I'll be sure to post my findings to the list.

&gt; Who knows;
&gt;                 Below the heater controls on Ramona's dash, there is a red plastic round
&gt; button-esque light that, when depressed, goes lit red. There is a &quot;B&quot; in the
&gt; center etched in white.
&gt;                 Been there forever, and I've never known its use. We've always used it as
&gt; the miscellaneous James Bond button; fire bombs, rear-end oil spray (like
&gt; 'Mona needs a button pushed to do that ;), and, her favorite, the cloaking
&gt; device initiator.
&gt;                 Stranger, it always used to illuminate when pushed, even with no key on, but
&gt; since we've been tinkering around the past few months in our (successful)
&gt; effort to revive our hero-ess, the light no longer lights...so, that's what
&gt; really got me thinking about throwing out this post to you all.
&gt;                 Since we are not planning any future trips through Utah, the cloaking device
&gt; and lack thereof, is not a necessity, but we're very curious, and figure you
&gt; can help.
&gt; Many Thanks
