&gt; What do you think of the clips with a loop, and how do you go about safety

I have to admit I am not familiar with these.  I let it pass originally
without comment as my best answer is &quot;I don't know.&quot;  I have a great deal
of respect for Mr. Deering and if he says it will work then it will.

I have used many styles of throwout bearings through the years and have
rarely had trouble with any of them *by themselves*.  I have had problems
with throwout bearings when the forks were bent and cracked, when the
alignment collar was missing, when the seat on the pressure plate was
toasty and when one of the springs on the pressure plate was broken.
Bent/broken throwout forks are the most common so that would be my first
check.

Basically what I am saying is that while it is possible to get one bad TO
bearing by the third bearing it is time to start looking elsewhere for the
problem.

                             OOK!
