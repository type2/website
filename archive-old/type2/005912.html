&gt;NO!   The self supporting starter will NOT work on a 2.0L with a 228mm flywheel.
&gt;No way no how. If he has a 76, he has a 228 flywheel. It will not engage the
&gt;teeth. It will work on a 2.0L with an auto trans.

I did not know that ! I've been using a self-supporting starter on a Porsche 911
engine with a Porsche 228 flywheel for years.( What am i doing wrong ?! &lt;:^)
Porsche 914 flywheel ring gear teeth are mounted 1/8 &quot; closer to the transaxle,
and i have the same measurement with my combination of  911 / vw parts,
requiring a slight clearancing in the 76 vw manual trans for the flywheel to clear
the bellhousing, both on the o.d. circumference and at the four bolt casting places.
I am using a 76 911 Euro Carrera flywheel, and a 228mm feramic ( metal ) 6-puck clutch pack.
Perhaps the 2.0 vw flywheel is not working with the self-supporting starter for the opposite
clearance problem, being 1/8&quot; further  back from engagement. Another good reason to
install the &quot; improved&quot; acnonvw engine.Or perhaps the 914 flywheel will make it work
in the 76 2.0 Bus. We need to go check the engagement distance of the two starters.
