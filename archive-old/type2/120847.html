Hi Laura,

&gt; Does anyone know the order of diagnosing an engine problem.


First, do the easy stuff. Check the oil and make sure that ALL the hose 
connections on the engine are tight and the wires are firmly attached 
where they need to go. Make sure you have gas, and listen for the whirr 
of the fuel pump when you first turn the key.

Second, get a good manual. For an FI bus you want to own the Bentley, 
they are readily available new online and often come up in the $10 
price range for a used copy on eBay.

The manual lists the troubleshooting procedures. For the kind of 
problem you're having it recommends testing the electrical components 
(coil, plugs, distributor) before testing the compression.

One burned valve alone would not prevent your engine from starting. At 
this stage I would guess that it's much more likely to be related to a 
loose wire or a disconnected vacuum hose.

Happy trails,
