Subject: Re: [T2] heater box removal

The 411\412 had &quot;type4&quot; motors and they had heater boxes that did not have
the fins like the buses do...if you strip the sheilding off the 411 heater
boxes you are left with a the J-tubes you are looking for, complete with
flanges...

I have a pair on my '77 Sunroof bus....

Trouble is finding a pair...

&gt; Who sells pipes that I can replace my heater boxes with? I want to do away
&gt; with the stock heater system since I have a gas heater and would like to
sell
&gt; the heater boxes that I have and just replace them with some kind of pipe
&gt; setup. They used to make a J pipe for bugs, do they make a similar setup
for
&gt; buses?
