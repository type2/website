Subject: Re: [T2] oil temp?

Pete '77 Westy concedes that the dirt-cheap long candy or deep fryer 
thermometer can only be read if you pull over.  Is the next 
development to make the probe of this thermometer a permanent 
substitute for the dipstick, marked with the same oil levels, and 
mfr of a long connection to the humble $7 gauge promoted to the glory 
of the dashboard?


&gt;
&gt;Bus Brother Mark Kruezer who is on a cross country trip in a '85 Westy
&gt;with a Zetec (www.ourwesty_dot_com) engine right now gave me this tip for
&gt;a quick fix:
&gt;
&gt;Go to Menard's or a Kitchen supply place and purchase a, long enough 
&gt;to make it down the dipstick tube
&gt;to the lowest part.  I got one at Menard's for $7.00.  It is about 11'
&gt;long.  My temp is solid at 225 when I check it with the thermo.  The
&gt;thermo goes up to 550 degrees.  Mark uses this method on a '79 Beetle.
&gt;
&gt;Not exactly convienent as you have to pull over, but is decent quick fix.
