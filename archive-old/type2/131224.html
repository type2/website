Subject: bus Vs vanagon turn signal / break light bulbs

Im pretty sure these are one and the same, right? Same bulbs for both the 
baywindow bus and the vanagon, for side markers. turn signals, break and 
reverse lights?

If so, I did some searching around and found the higher wattage bulbs for 
these that you may have seen on the now infamous RoadHaus.

This is NAPA part # #7352970 (if you try the archives, some list a dash in 
them, but their website does not recognize the dash, FYI.)

$2.49 each and with shipping for 8 of them + tax, my total came to $26.26

Pretty small investment to become a little more visable at night to the 
crazy drivers out there.

best,
