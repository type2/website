how
can i get in touch with Mr. Howard of the Howard special...I lost his e-mail
address and 2- I need to determine if it is cost effective to repro the vent
trim for delux busses. I have a price quoted to me and it includes the metal
clips but I need to order enuf for 300 busses. The retail would have to be
$75/set of 18. Can you ask around or get Mr Howard to post this survey to the
Bus people to e-mail me at oldred62_at_aol_dot_com please?? Also we are looking into
the beauty rings for busses too any interest??
