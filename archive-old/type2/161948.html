Subject: Re: [T2] license light question, rust removal

Is it really bronze, or is is brass?

In any case, brass and all flavors of bronze are far more noble than steel,
and the steel will corrode no matter how you hook up this little battery. =^
) If you don't want them to corrode then either keep the electrolytic water
off them, or else put an even baser sacrificial metal in the mix. Zinc works
great as a sacrificial anode and you probably have some zinc around. I
though you were an ex-boater, all sailors know this. =^ ) Aluminum will work
as a sacrificial metal too.
