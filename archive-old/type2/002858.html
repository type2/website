&gt; Take a screw to Home Depot and see what stainless steel screws they've got
&gt; that are close. This is a good place to use screws that will not rust


I have tried this in the past and even went to a local metric bolt company,
and no luck.  The difference is in the head.  It has a screw type head, and
other than bolts, have had no luck.

Maybe the people on the list could combine to figure this out.  At the
dealer they are over $1 apiece, and there are 20 something on the van.......

I am putting on the vanagonlist as well

&gt; &gt; I was wondering if there is a source for the screws that attach the
luggage
&gt; &gt; rack &amp; poptop to the bus.  This in on my 82 westy.  The poptop looks
pretty
&gt; &gt; good except a number of the screws are rusty looking &amp; look bad.  I this
a
&gt; &gt; special screw or what?  Thanks.
