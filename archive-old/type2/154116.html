Subject: Bus Front Beam

Ok - here is the issue.....A rusty front beam and bad ball joints....here is
my solution, replace the front beam complete....I've search all the archives
and understand what I need to do to replace the beam but my question is -
should I buy a stock front end or a lowered front end, say 2&quot; or so?....if I
buy the lowered front end how far can I go using stock parts?  is there any
advantage to the lowered front end?  and last, I live in Rhode Island and if
you know of anyone with a good used front beam send them my way..

Thanks in advance,
Mike Quackenbush
