Hi Jack,

What you describe has a lot of implications, but not the ones you mentioned.
Perhaps you were already aware of them.

Changing the exhaust will change the airflow through your Kadrons, so the
carb will likely need to be re-jetted or you may at minimum need to adjust
the accelerator pump rod.  Gene Berg's writings cover this specific
situation as an example on the Kadrons.

As for the heat risers and how they impact the air flow... I would consider
that a minor change to the &quot;system&quot; compared to other changes you have made:
1) use of Kadrons instead of stock carb.  2) Associated air cleaners on
Kadrons are much less restrictive than VW cleaners.  3) Your 1776
displacement change...

All of this leads to much more air going out than the stock muffler was
tested with by VW for (although it works from 1200 to 1600 with various
carbs, it may do fine at your config).

Does one of your Kadron's have provision for breathing off the oil filler?
I'm just curious.

I'm going through the same learning on Dual Kadrons + 1600DP with &quot;dual
quiet pack exhaust&quot;.

A 1776 with Kadrons.  Used to have an extractor on this  but I'm
disappointed with the noise and with the heat generated in this part.  So I
am installing a stock muffler, hoping that it does not restrict the Kadrons
too much.

With the Kadrons, there is no need for the heat riser tube so I had planned
to cap off the flanges on the muffler where this tube usually goes.

I've read, perhaps in Hoover, that a stock engine depends on circulation
through the heat riser tube to balance the exhaust flow and that, if I do
cap off the flanges, I disturb this flow.

First question:  Is this lack of circulation something that we should be
concerned with?

Secondly, if so, perhaps i should connect the two flanges with a piece of
copper tubing, just to allow this flow.

I'd appreciate comments on all this.

Jack
