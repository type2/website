You don't carry panty hose?  geez!  Its almost as important as duct tape! ;-)
I suppose you could use them for a fishing net, hair net, face mask for
knocking off liquor stores...heh, or you could even fabricate a fan belt out of
a pair of panty hose and duct tape...I've heard of it being done.

Not that I reccomend any of these procedures....

and...when you go camping....don't forget the tiki torches!!
