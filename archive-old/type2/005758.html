 Employement&gt; I use to be a professional student.  11 years, 270 semester
units.  I had to get a real job.  I now teach Science.  My schedule as a
teacher leaves lots of time for summer travels.  I am working on finishing
up my 67 13 window.  It made it to Kelly Park in San Jose right after I had
the paint/body done, but my wife drove it to work and the throttle stuck.
She told me the starter was broken,  She didn't mention that the block was
seized.  I now have a new tranny for the bus, and a patched together motor
to get it back on the road.  It should be mobile again in Summer.
    Enjoy your toys,
        Dave West&gt;
