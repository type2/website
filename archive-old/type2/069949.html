&gt;The next time you run your motor, feel the alternator.  Better yet, look
&gt;at it.  Notice that it is connected to the air-cooling system.  No
&gt;combustion happens in the alternator, yet it gets very hot. 

Craig,
Ever hear of induction? Go to Monkey Wards appliance dept. and ask for a demo of
the inductive cooktop of one of their newer stoves. You won't see anything move
(ie, no friction) until the pot starts to boil over. The alternator/generator
gets hot because it's generating power. Run it with all the wires disconnected
and a good ways away from a hot VW air-cooled engine and it won't get so hot. 

&gt;Not to drag out a minor discussion, but this isn't just my opinion.  I am
&gt;repeating a fact.  Just ask any mechanic.

Just so happens, I am a mechanic. Degreed, and frequently dirty.
I repeat: There is no way you can create enough mechanical energy by burning a
fuel to create more heat (energy) than you started with in the first place.
The stored chemical energy released by burning fuel (in an internal combustion
engine) is converted to mechanical energy by the resultant expanding gasses. All
the energy is first created by HEAT. There is NO WAY you can get out more heat
(energy ) than you put in, and get acceleration of mass to boot. Fer gosh sakes,
man, do you think your wheel bearings EVER get as hot as your engine oil? (and I
don't mean after you've just used your brakes too decel from freeway speeds to a
dead stop). And those eight bearings are carrying the weight of the entire van,
without the benifit of a viscous coupling to a cooler!

&quot;Am I being baited, or what?&quot;
