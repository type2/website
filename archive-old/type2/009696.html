&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;        Just to add myself into all this talk about mufflers, I just
&gt;bought a cheapy cheapo muffler from JC Whitney. It came with a little
&gt;rust already on it. It came with one tailpipe port, not 2. It also was
&gt;very hard to get in, needed alot of coaxing. My question is, should I be
&gt;afraid of what a single tail pipe is going to do?

Stock bus muffler has only one tail pipe but there is another pipe that 
attaches
and routes out to the side.

The PO of my bus had fitted a Beetle muffler to my bus (and cut out two 
hole in the apron!)
but I replaced it with the German kit from Ron _at_ the busdepot (Thanks 
Ron!) It fitted like
a dream, everything lined up! and I was impressed with the quality.

They do cost more, and IMHO are worth the extra, but when cash is tight
any muffler is better than a none!!

Regards,
