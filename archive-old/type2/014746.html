It does seem high untill you start to do it yourself and add up what you
have spent, then give yourself even minimum wage and you find that you have
spent that much or more. Restorations are not cheap, real good jobs are even
more. You will save some money if you do it yourself, but not that much, it
does however give you the ability to spend when you have it and save when
you don't. And in the end it give you the great pride to say you did it
yourself.

Hey everyone...
  I'm looking to do a total restoration on my 68 bus with updadted
interior/paint. I called the folks at West Coast Classic
(www.classicvws_dot_net) and thier ball park figure for ANY type 2 early or
late, is $15,000 to 20,000. Is this a lot of money for a resto?

  'Preciate your 411...

peace &amp; harmony

P.S. Happy New Year!
