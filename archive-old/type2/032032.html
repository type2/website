Hi

I'm a new guy who sent a message earlier but never saw it.  Maybe I did
something wrong? whatever.  Anyways, a little history, I sold my '90
Subaru Legacy Wagon with 79K miles on it in top shape, with lots of
suspension and stereo upgrades an exhaust an intake, new plug wires all
the usual import stuff for $6800 dollars and bought a '79 bus with
interior from a '73 westfalia and a CD player for $1800.  PO said oil leak
was from oil cooler to crankcase seals which had hardened while bus sat
and replacing them would fix things.  I have the idiots guide, the bentley
some tools and a belief that I am as smart as any mechanic I just need to
figure out what I'm doing.  I've been reading the list for a few days now
and just today noticed someone saying that a late model bus isn't a great
place to start.  I guess I'll find out.
	Anyways, today I decided to take care of those oil cooler seals
and stop that oil leak.  Saw someone say it took them 4-5 hours so i
allowed plenty of time.  I've never worked on a VW before and it was an
experience.  Since the bus ran well and i didn't know jack about the
engines I bought it without really looking at the engine. a mistake!
Since the halves of my fan housing wouldn't seperate while in the bus it
looked for a short while like the exhaust manifolds/heat exchangers would
have to be dropped for the housing to be removed.  I loosened the right
side but it wasn't going easy so i stopped.  I worked/tugged out a
different manner for removing the fan housing and everything is still
intact.  I replaced the oil cooler seals which looked brand new and quite
clean with no signs of oil leaking from around them.  Oh well.  Throughout
this process I learned to appreciate the common hatred of the oft-referred
to &quot;PO&quot; which I have observed on this list.  Well deserved, all of it.  So
having wasted four hours I put everything back together.  Last thing to do
is tighten up that heat exchanger/exhaust manifold I loosened and be on my
way.  Tighter, tighter, snap, the stud broke!  S__T!  NOw after six hours
of work my bus is louder than hell, I have a broken stud and it still
leaks oil.

Sorry for the length but I needed to vent.  

The question.  
	What to do?  Obviously remove stud as described in Idiots guide.
I doubt it will unscrew.  So if I have to drill it do I need to re-tap the
hole for a new stud? What size tap? Where to get it? What size stud? Where
to get it?  Will it be bigger?  Will I need to drill the bracket on the
exhaust manifold out for this bigger stud?  Do I have to pull the
engine? Can all this be done from below? Please help?  By the way I don't
know much about what I'm doing so try to make any instructions simple and
detailed.  

That $5000 you think I have from selling the other car all got spent on
school so I really have about $300 I can spend but I need to buy food and
gas too for amonth or two.  I'll have money for a rebuild kit or paint or
other things in June but untill then I guess I'll just have the loudest
bus in town.  So the cheapest worthwhile fix would be appreciated.  But
feel free to outline the ideal fix and maybe I'll wait till June.

Thanks in advance.

DAN

p.s.  &quot;Gee, maybe a late bus with lots of rust isn't the best place to
	learn?  Oh well.&quot;
