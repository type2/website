Well Gang I told you that I would keep you posted...
     Today I left a less than pleasant message with Dawn at PLF.  I stated 
that she had until this Friday at 5 p.m. to produce either a refund check or 
a pop-top that I ordered the first of September or else...
Shortly thereafter I received a return phone call(I guess her answering 
machine does work) from a guy named Richard.  Don't know his relation.  It 
seems that in addition to Dawn's divorce, relocation, child custody battle 
and week long vacation now her son has broken his arm and was hospitalized as 
a result.  Richard was apologetic and stated that he would take out a cash 
advance to refund my money if I so desired.  I told him that based on the 
recommendations of this list I truly wanted my custom pop-top.  To cancel now 
and reorder somewhere else would take another 4 weeks.  He states Dawn is not 
taking any new orders and plans on being caught up by mid January.  I did 
state that this is not the way to do business and if I would just get an 
occasional return message with a realistic timeframe and no more false 
promises that I would be happy.

Stay tuned,
