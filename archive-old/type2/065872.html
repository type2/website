Subject: Rescue:  '73 &amp; '72 Westys (Springfield, MO, USA)

The local VW repair shop is trying to get rid of a couple of campers that 
have been sitting out back for the last few years.

'73 Westfalia - Was in decent condition before the engine fire.  Damage 
limited to the engine compartment and a little above.  Good title.

'72 Westfalia - Pretty rough.  Came in for an engine rebuild and the 
owner never returned (I think).  Good parts Bus.  You might verify the 
title situation.  Has the complete motor (in pieces) with a new 
(reground) crank.

Contact Overseas Service (Keith Smith) in Springfield, Missouri.  
417-865-6611.

I think $500 would buy the pair.

Remember, contact Keith not me.
