Subject: What is the value of a 75 Westy?

Hi folks!

I am going to look at a 75 Westy Weekender tomorrow night.  It is a non-pop
top, from what I have been told, this is the definition of a Westy
Weekender.  Is this corect?

Here's the scoop on it.  Original paint, a little faded but no rust.  All
original interior in great shape, with exception of driver's seat that has a
couple of tears.  Recently did some work - new brakes and shocks all around,
clutch cable, etc.

Problem - engine is blowing black smoke, so some type of significant engine
problem coming on.

Not sure of mileage.

So the big question - how much is something like this worth?

The car is located in Colorado.

Thanx for your help!

Z
