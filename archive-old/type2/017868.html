The one thing I have been realy dissatisfied with with our '71s is the
way they ride in the front.  Even with new shocks, the front ends are
definitely higher from the ground when viewed from the side than the
rear is.  When you try to use the rear view mirror, you can only see a
little ways behind you--it's like you are really tilted up and the
mirror is only giving you a view of one car behind you, not as much of
the road as it could, like other cars.

Would a mirror from another year bus (earlier or later) correct this
problem?  Or am I doomed to low visibility in the rear view mirror?  By
the way, our local parts guys think I am nuts when I mention this!

&gt; window (where the '73's cabinet is) without moving my head.  And I get a
&gt; better view on what's happening in the rear seat with my two kids.
