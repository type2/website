Subject: Re: Rolling back - the death of the manual transmission

Just a few comments on the &quot;standard transmission&quot; I read an article a few
years ago predicting:
within five years manual transmissions would be not available on most cars,
and would be a 
expensive option on a few. The reasons?
It costs $1Million to smog qualify an engine/transmission combo, and the
numbers of standards
being bought was soon going to fall too low to make it worthwhile. If they
become an extra cost option,
the numbers plummet even further meaning the ten remaining users have to
split the $1M 10 ways;-0
Even for sports cars they said they would be replaced by SemiAutomatic, or
&quot;tiptronic&quot; automatics
with an up down button for manual mode. - And sure enough I've seen several
cars this year, 
including the Lexus is300 which that is what they have as a &quot;standard&quot;
transmission.

Why are manuals not popular - well it seems people are too busy  in their
cars. They have cell phone
in one hand, a coffee in the other, a paper in their lap, and are fighting
with the Internet access computer
so they just don't have a hand to shift! I think it is they are all just too
damn clueless to drive, like
my sister in law who has to have a 4wd automatic SUV because it snows where
she lives. She flys off the
road at least once a year. I won't tempt fate be mentioning if I've ever
flown off the road or not having 
lived 500 miles north of her driving for 30 years. Of course I've spent most
of my life driving
rear wheel drive cars with summer or all season tires so I've learned to be
gentle;-) 

A comment though on winter driving. We had our first storm this week with
about a foot of snow
overnight. I decided to take the Camry which is a FWD manual transmission,
and had not troubles.
It seemed quite natural in spite of driving an automagic  for most of a
year. This morning we had another
4&quot; of snow, and I took the RWD automagic Cressida. Yeaaaaaaa Haaaaa! Its a
good thing 
I cleaned the side windows, because for the first five minutes or so, the
windshield wasn't pointing 
where I was going. Took about 5 minutes for the old instincts to kick back
in. Then I really had some fun!
I still wish I had some control of what the back wheels were doing, instead
of just being able to 
input vague suggestions via the gas pedal. The thing is also too damn quiet
to hear what is going on 
back there! The first sign you have of wheel spin is when the world outside
starts to go round.
