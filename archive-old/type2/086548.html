fellow listmembers....

So I finally tracked down the little parts I needed to finish this =
freakin brake project. (I hope anyway)

Tassi in Daly City is closed on Mondays it turns out, so I got ahold of =
Donsco VW down near San Mateo and they hooked me up with the parts I =
need.=20

The problem started with me ordering brand new shoes instead of rebuilt =
ones from Bimmerparts_dot_com. They were really cheap and had some other =
great items for cheap that I needed. Well, the shoes they send do not =
have the e-brake lever attached to them, and my old ones have this =
superduper rivets holding the existing ones on. That left me with no =
good way to remove the rivit without a whole lot of cursing and probably =
lever-bending in the process, not to mention no hardware to attach them =
to the new shoes.=20

I could find the clips pretty easy at my local vw dealer, but those pins =
are no more.=20

Donsco hooked me up with the clips, pins, and new levers for a few bucks =
so I got there just before they closed and walked away this much closer =
to being back on the road.=20

Take a look at the parts if you'd like, you wouldn't believe how nice it =
is for me to see them. Share in the joy!
