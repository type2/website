Subject: Info needed

There is a current debate on the list about a fuse in the wiring harness 
fuel circuit/double relay. I want to collect some info on year and model 
types.

This fuse goes to the reverse lights, it is branched between the + side of 
the coil and 86c on the double relay. It is a fuse holder that has 2 wires 
on one side and 1 on the other. It should be located on the driver's side of 
the engine compartment between the foam seal and the aux. battery.

Anyway anyone who has the time or can remember seeing it in their bus pmail 
me. I will post the results to the list.

The info:
What year is your bus?
What is the manufacture date?
What model, ie Westy, Deluxe, Passenger?
Auto or mannual tranny?
Do you have the fuse holder?

Thanks,


Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, &quot;el Verde&quot;
