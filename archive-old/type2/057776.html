Hi Folks!

Thanks for all the helpful advice regarding my pulley failure problem. I'll be putting my engine back together this weekend and will use a different generator, stand, and fan. Also will check alignment of pulleys very carefully. Just maybe... this will fix the problem. Only time will tell.

I have a neighbor who restores VW's who is interested in liquidating some of his assets, which include several buses: 

'69 Westfalia Pop Top, dark blue, interior and canvas good. Engine runs. Generally good condition.

'71 Westfalia Pop Top, interior rough, some rust. I'm not sure of the condition of the engine, but I think it runs.

'71 Single Cab, no motor or tranny, heavy rust on bed and around windshield. Some rust-through but can be repaired by replacing body panels. Includes drop sides ( detached) and original key, which works ignition AND lower storage compartment.

In addition, there are several post-71 parts buses, some pretty picked over but still some good parts. Some camper parts, including a complete (?) gas heater in one.

The price on all of the above is open to negotiation, and all can be purchased as-is or can be repaired/restored by the seller, again price negotiable.

Also lots of bugs and bug parts, plus ghias, type III's, Porsches, etc. 

Special Mention (off-topic)
Citroens:
'69 DS, '76 CX, both with titles plus three parts cars of various vintage. All five sold together for only $2000!

We'll be heading to the Kerrville Folk Festival over Labor Day Weekend. If any of you are going, look for the sierra yellow/white bus with orange drive-away tent. 


Later,

Russell
