Subject: Re: [T2] melted bilge blower fan

I experienced the same meltdown with my bilge fan and after some 
discussion on the list etc I think there is a &quot;better way&quot;.
Here in the great white north I have become somewhat obsessed with 
heat, especially because I drive my bus year round ...

Here is my plan when I get the money to buy two new turbo style bilge 
blowers.

IF the heating system, heat exchangers, flaps and ducting is all in 
good shape and nicely insulated I think this would be the way to go.
Rather than mounting a blower in the belly SUCKING air from the heat 
exchangers I plan on mounting the two turbo style blowers in the engine 
bay (al la stock) with one pulling air from the cabin via some ducting 
and blowing it at 250cfm to one exchanger and the other pulling fresh 
air and blowing it at 250cfm to the other exchanger. From some of the 
discussion on the list it was also passed around that the belly style 
bilge blower COULD potentially SUCK more bad news into the system from 
a leaky heat exchanger/system while a blower system wouldn't create the 
negative pressure. Also, I don't know what kind of bilge blower you 
were running but mine was NOT quiet so sticking them in the back with 
the noise and the insulation would perhaps quiet things down a bit at 
full bore.

Pulling warmer and warmer air from the cabin would eventually lead to 
warmer and warmer air while the fresh air would ensure you don't turn 
into a brick of ice on the inside from humidity. Put it all on a dial 
to adjust the speed perhaps ....

Any thoughts ?

Steve
