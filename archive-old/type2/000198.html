Mercedes wheels have the same bolt pattern but a 1/2' wider offset that
stock VW Bus wheels. I found one company that makes a wheel with the correct
offset and bolt pattern for the VW Bus and are 5 1/2&quot; wide. They are chrome
and have a nice design. Cost is $59.95 each, $17.00 each shipping, and
$12.50 each for clear powder coating. The name of the place is CWI and I
will post the address and # when I get home. TBear
