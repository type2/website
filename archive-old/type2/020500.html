hello
    oxygen isn't added to fuel per se, but materials containing high amounts of
oxygen, a common additive is MBTE and ethanol an alcohol based material. these
additives are not really any cheaper, ethanol for instances is cheap but only
because it is subsidized by our taxes, cost of refinement is actually similar to
gasoline.the basic problem is that these additives effectively lower the octane
rating of the fuel as they burn at lower temperatures (i.e. you get more
complete combustion, hence less bad stuff out the tailpipe) , simply move up a
grade of gas and you should notice no adverse effects. the additives are used
primarily in states where people care about air quality, such as california and
all states that follow California's air quality regulations, though the grain
industry is pushing for this to be more widespread as it means more money for
them (most of these additives are derived from grain).  Environmentalists don't
like the additives because they result in some significant side effects, e.g.
water pollution, why california is looking to ban some of them, apparently
people don't like drinking water that tastes and smells like grain alcohol and
causes cancer, go figure ;-)
but as i said moving up in the octane rating should cancel the effects of
oxygenated fuel and keep our buses happy.
later
Jamie
p.s.  For those nit pickers, i admit i simplified things here a bit for the sake
of illustration.
