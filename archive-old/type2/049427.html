Hi Folks,

   The original poster said;
&quot;and I think im getting the girl who owns this bus some thermal socks for 
Christmas. =)&quot;
   And I say, don't stop with socks.  Make sure she has a hat, gloves, 
scarf,long underwear, and a good fleece pullover.  If fashion isn't a 
problem, insulated coveralls work good.
