&gt; On the top. the starter is held in by a nut and bolt which also happens to be
&gt; one of the

&gt; accessed from inside the engine compartment.  This is between the fan
&gt; housing and the firewall on your Bus.  You can't really see the nut, you
&gt; will have to feel for it.  It's 17mm and you will only be able to get a
&gt; wrench on it.

I bought a 17/19 combo racheting wrench on a listmember's suggestion and it has
paid for itself ten times over for this nut alone.

Good Luck
