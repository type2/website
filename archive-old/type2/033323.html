Ok, ok -- what's all this math that you guys are doing? I understand
that in 185R14, the R stands for the width of the tire and the 14 is the
size of the rim so the 185 is the diameter of the tire, I presume, but
where are you getting these decimal numbers and what does it all mean???!!!

Nikki

&gt; &gt; 185 x .78 = 144.3
&gt; &gt; 195 x .75 = 146.25
&gt; 
&gt; 205 x .70 = 143.5
