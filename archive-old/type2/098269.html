&gt; Hey all-
&gt;
&gt; Just how difficult is it to swap out an old one
&gt; with a new one like the one sold at bus depot - Axle Shaft with CV Joints and
&gt; Boots, brand new, ready to install (68-79 bus w/manual trans) $119.95  211
&gt; 501 203 -

Not hard at all.  Remove 12 bolts using special triple-square driver
socket (also available from Bus Depot), remove axle, install new axle,
replace bolts, torque to (IIRC) 24 ft-lbs.

Easiest to do if you lift the wheel just off the ground with a jack under
the shock mount.

Make sure the CVs are well greased, and keep everything clean to prevent
cross-contamination.
