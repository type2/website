&gt;I have a 1974  Westfalia  1800 cc,  Manual Trans, Dual Carbs
&gt;Distributor: VW 021-905-205N, Bosch 0 231 181 005
&gt;Timing Set At: 10deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
&gt;Right now it is advancing to 38 deg btdc at WOT.   Unfortunatly, I do not
&gt;have a tach that goes over 2500 rpm.
&gt;Is this too far advanced?
&gt;Can I overheat the engine with this setting?
&gt;What should I set the Initial timing at to make sure that it does not
&gt;advance too far?
&gt;TIA.
&gt;

You have a dual vacuum advance, correct?
You have vacuum at idle to the inboard nipple, correct?
If you disconnect that vacuum your timing goes to 7.5 BTDC, correct?
If all 3 answers are correct, your total amount is correct.
You are neglecting to realize that when you drive down the road at a steady speed, your vacuum retard comes back and cancels vacuum advance. Both vacuums are equal and the spring in the dual unit centers the advance. As soon as you give it throttle, manifold vacuum drops and you get advance. Ported vacuum overcomes the spring. At a steady speed above around 3600 rpm's you would only have about 25 degrees of centrificul advance.
