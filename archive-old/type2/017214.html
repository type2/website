     Too bad you took out the middle one -- that's what holds the fan
hub on to the end of the crank. It's really crucial that your fan hub
doesn't move on the crank, otherwise your timing will be way off -- I
burnt up my heads last year because of that, although it was my own
stupid fault for not paying more attention. Anyway, once you get the fan
off, maker sure the hub isn't loose on the shaft, and if it is, make
sure the key is good. When you put that bolt back in, some good loc-tite
or expoxy is in order.
      In fact, I'd put the middle bolt back in now before you try any
more to get the fan off. 
       The fan might be just jammed against the housing -- it's a very
small clearance, and easily gets cocked enough to jam it. In fact the
clearence has to be checked via feeler gauge, it's that small. That's
more than likely your problem.
