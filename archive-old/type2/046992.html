Subject: Re: [T2] cold weather and the weber carb eck!

Leaving your choke on will eventually foul your plugs, plus once the engine
does get warm, it'll start running like crap again. My Weber does the same
but my commute is only 5 minutes (I could really walk). And if I get on the
highway for  longer trips in the cold she warms up at highway speed no
problem. Its the stop and go that causes problems.

I have often thought of putting a choke cable in that I could open and close
as needed. A fellow listee turned me on to this site
http://www.controlcables_dot_com/  If you could find one long enough to run
under the Bus and to your carb...you could pull your choke closed at the
intersections until you feel it warm up?


&gt; So here is my question
&gt; Could I just leave the power lead to the choke disconnected?
&gt; When I did this test it smelled like it was running richer.
&gt; Could doing this mess up my engine as muir says, wash the oil
&gt; off the cylinder walls or would I only be wasting gas?
