Subject: [T2] straightening bumpers, painting poptop?

hi all. i'm in the process of fixing up the exterior of my
'77 westy, and i'm wondering if anyone has any experience
with straightening these type of bumpers. the bumpers are
just mildy warped on the front and back, probably the
result of a very low speed collision. they're also a little
scratched up, but with some sanding and spray paint, they
could look great again. one body shop quoted me $200 a
piece to fix them, which seems absurd. anybody have any
suggestions? if you know where to get &quot;new&quot; ones cheap,
that info would also be appreciated.

i'm also thinking about painting the fiberglass top. i've
seen a few other type IIs around town with a glossy finish
on their tops, which looks pretty sharp. anybody know how
to achieve this effect? can it be done by an amateur for
cheap? are they just using new vanagon tops, or is the
secret in the paint?

cheers,
ben
