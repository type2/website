&gt; replaced the rear brake hoses this AM as they were clogged (65 camper)
&gt;  managed to bash my finger right well and have a lovely blister to show for
&gt; it.   had to be somewhere, so i cleaned up, got a phone call from a friend of
&gt; a friend who was driving from Eugene in his 
&gt; 65 bus which cr*pped out just north of Chehalis and needed help.  I promised
&gt; to call back in the afternoon, as i needed to go, and got in the bug and
&gt; split
&gt; 
&gt; but only got a mile down the road before Bugster went on strike.  went to see
&gt; if a wire fell off, feeling late already, when i friend stopped and took me
&gt; home, leaving Bugster for the day :( 
&gt; 
&gt;   I jumped in the 54 kombi, which started right up. (glad i had renewed the
&gt; registration, which was lapsed. )  after a bit i became incredibly aware of
&gt; the lack of instruments in this archaic transport.   i tried to remember how
&gt; much gas there was.   I know some had been put in last weekend, probably on
&gt; the way to Seattle.     hmm, that's pretty far there and back,   but i cn
&gt; always flip it to reserve.   round the next curve the bus starts to sputter.

I am sorry to hear of the troubles Clara...I must have had all the VW
zen this weekend...for once things went surprisingly well.  I managed
to rebuild and plumb the entire brake system [save master cylinder and
one front wheel cylinder which looked fine...was it start leaking next
week]...I even sanded down the rear drums replaced the oil seal,
checked and renewed the bearings...did the front races and bearings
...and rebuilt the hinge mechanism on the westy rear bench/bed

All this and to think...it was suppose to be Thunder showers all
weekend [typical for this summer], but we only had about five minutes
of rain yesterday...not enough to make it through the big maple and
get I wet....I think Jah was smiling at I all weekend.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
