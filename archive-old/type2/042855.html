Subject: 1600cc DP CWCrank question

Volks,

I am about to open a case with under 2000k on it. The PO did not vent the
crankcase and it is leaking. I also think he drove it over 70 MPH for
extended periods of time in a bus. It has a stock non-counterweighted crank
in it. 

I am bringing my bus to Italy with me and thought that while I have the case
apart, I may as well throw in a 69 scat CWcrank.

Any thoughts on this? Has anyone done this?
How high an RPM can I run the engine with a CWCrank and what would be the
corresponding MPH for a 1968 Campmobile, that is otherwise stock? Will be
running a Weber progressive with this setup. The cam is an engle 110.

Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Matt
