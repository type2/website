OK, I just bought my second bus (72 Westy) long story but it turned out to
be cheaper to purchase this bus than it was going to cost me for a set of
carbs for my 79 2L (the westy came with an extra set of Weber IDF 40's).
The 72' has set for at least 3 years and none of the previous owners have
ran it at ALL.  Yesterday (saturday) I finally got it fired up and though it
ran rough it did atleast run.  Now.... does anyone have any suggestions on
the following........

1.  I think I need to purge the brake fluid.  The fluid in the reservoir is
thick and yellow as opposed to thin and clear like new brake fluid am I
right? if so what is the best way to totally purge the entire system? Also
the Brake Pedal is extremely stiff to push and the little break light is on?
is this all tied to old break fluid?

2.  I had to replace the fuel pump (the old one I replaced was electric) I
think the fuel gel'ed in the pump cause it wouldn't do anything when I
hooked the power up to it.  I'm concerned about existing fuel in the system
do I just dilute it with new fuel and be proactive about changing filters
(I've got 3 inline between tank and carb right now) or should I somehow
flush the old fuel out.

I am planning on doing plugs and replacing ALL the fuel line next
weekend.... Any other suggestions for a van that has set for a long period
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
-Tim
