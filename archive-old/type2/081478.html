Subject: Re: [T2] Seats

My 72 had comfy honda bucket seats in it when it was given to me (I'm still
saying thank you)
Problem was they were bolted to 1/2&quot; plywood that was bolted to the deck.
I didn't think the seat belt would hold me in my seat if the seat was flying
out the window in a crash so I grabbed my falling apart stock drivers seat
from it's corner of the garage and cut the bottom of the frame out(the part
with the rails on it).
Then I sat it on the bottom of my honda seat and welded it everywhere it
touched.
Now I have an adjustable in all directions bucket seat.
For the passenger side I just welded the honda seat to some lengths of 3/8&quot;
plate and bolted it to the deck.Sounds like a hack job but it looks and
works pro, passed inspecton too.
Something to try.
Brian

&gt; David
&gt; I just did this on my 76. Most of my VW Buddies refer to pre-80 front
seats
&gt; as &quot;torture devices&quot;...especially on long trips...got tired of using
&gt; pillows,etc....soooo...I bought a pair of 86 Vanagon seats, but had to
&gt; replace the seat rails also.  This required chiseling the existing ones
off
&gt; my 76 also had to countersink the mounting holes on the rails and use
&gt; stainless tappered bolts to mount the rails. Also need to build up one
side
&gt; of each rail with steel shims as there is a drop off on the right rail on
&gt; each side. If you have a buddy that can weld them on, moeasy. If you have
a
&gt; 78 or later bus, the rails are the same.  Good Luck!
&gt; Aloha
