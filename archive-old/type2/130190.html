Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection Savist Needed for Late FI

Hi Michael,

I'm in a VERY similar situation (1976, Manual with the progressive 
two-barrel conversion by a P.O.  I hate it and want the original FI.  
I'll be following this thread with both eagerness and dread!

Jeff

&gt; Senario:  1977 (Manufacture date Nov. 76), Westy Automatic Trans., 
&gt; currently Webberized(Single Progressive), needs to go back to stock 
&gt; FI. Simple to put together parts list, hard to rob a bank and make the 
&gt; get away to pay for with this Webber. I have some one willing to put 
&gt; together a complete setup affordably (Parts from '76-'79).I have been 
&gt; told by many that a complete system from any of those years would work 
&gt; reguardless of year of Bus.
