If you have a propane torch, gently heat the head of the piston while
pushing/gently tapping on the piston pin; the piston will typically expand
at a different rate than the piston pin (they're made of different
materials) allowing the pin to slip out.

&gt; I just figured out why I don't have compression in 4... :)
&gt;
&gt; So, now I want to take the piston off to replace it, but I can't get the
&gt; bar (don't know the technical term) out that slips through the con-rod
&gt; and the piston.  I took out the clip but it doesn't want to budge.  I
&gt; only used thumb force on the one side because I don't want go bangin' on
&gt; it.
&gt;
&gt; Any recommendations on how to get it out?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
