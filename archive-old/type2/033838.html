Robert, 
it very well might be a loose connection, but you
might want to check out the type 2 library under
electrical, then under the starter section for hot
starts.  mine started doing the same thing at first
when it was hot, then whenever she felt like it.  i
installed the simple relay outlined in the library and
its been smooth sailing ever since.  hope that helps

&gt; Hello all....
&gt; 
&gt; Have another problem with my '76 Westy, Helga.  Went
&gt; to start her up tonight
&gt; and was greeted with, you guessed
&gt; it....click...click.  Had lights, but it
&gt; would not turn over.  What could it be?  Is it the
&gt; starter?  I was also
&gt; thinking I may have caused this problem.  Last week
&gt; I had to replace the
&gt; positive battery cable.  Could a loose connection be
&gt; the cause of this?  Let
&gt; me know what you think.  I always appreciate the
&gt; help I get from the list.
&gt; There is NO WAY I could keep my baby running without
&gt; the list.  I will stop
&gt; now.  I am starting to sound like I am sucking
&gt; up.....
