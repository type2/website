Subject: RE: [T2] Cheap buses (was CHEEP BUSES)

Harry said:
&lt;&lt; Moral of the story, busses are overpriced! I finally found one here
on

Evening all,  

I just subscribed to the list, although I am not new to VWs in general.
I will be picking up a 1974 VW Bus (deluxe) on Sunday.  It was free to a
good home.  The bus had suffered an engine fire (carb fuel line split)on
the way from Montanna to Virginia. The young women who was driving it
paid to have it towed here to Virginia, where it has sat in her garage
for the past 5 years.

Anyway, the reason I'm writing.  If you guys think buses are overpriced
now, I can't wait to see what happens when VW reintroduces the Microbus.
I expect prices to go up by at least 1/3.  The same thing happened when
they re-introduced the beetle.  Now you can't find a decent 70's
Bug/Super Bug for less than 4-5k.

I'm getting mine now while the getting is good!
