&gt; Yes! By all means, top it up! Another thing that might help is adding a
&gt; part bottle of auto trans seal conditioner. I've never tried it on a
&gt; steering box, but it sure works on transmissions. Makes the seals soft
&gt; again. And really you have nothing to lose. Running low on grease is
&gt; sure to wear it out rapidly.

&gt; So how does one top off the steering box?  Does it have to be removed?

Steve:
The 68-72 model w/ worm and peg box has a square headed pipe plug at the
upper corner of the cover. I know I've added grease to my 69 before, I
might have loaded the grease into a squeeze bottle of some kind. Elmer's
glue bottle, or something like that. I usually am in a panic, dump the
contents into the garbage, fill it with 90w grease. Sure makes my wife
mad when she goes to glue something.:^)(I could write a book on how to
annoy a spouse.)
I think the later recirculating box (73-79) still has a similar plug.
