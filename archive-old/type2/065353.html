Subject: Gas tank question on '66

Is there some sort of pressure release valve on the gas tank?

There seems to be an aweful lot of pressure in there sometimes, and I've got
a suspicion that this might be the cause of my starting problem.  

Is it possible that the pressure in my gas tank is so great that it goes thru
the fuel pump and overcomes the carb float/valve and thusly (I've always wanted
to use that in a sentence) floods my engine?  

I disconnected the gas line to the carb and gas came out and continued 
to come out until I opened the gas cap.

Thanks for any tips,
...Markus
