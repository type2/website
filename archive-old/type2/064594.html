My personal reason for paranoia is that right here in my little parking
lot I have what used to be a gorgeous '64 sedan. The PO, a *real* good
mechanic, had driven it here (NYC) from Kansas, decided the brakes were
a bit soft, did an adjustment and DOH! forgot to bleed them. Took it for
a test spin, ran a light, got hit by a cab. He couldn't deal with it, so
he just handed me the keys and the title. A sad, sad story. I guess I
just expect myself to make stupid mistakes, and if that leaves me
sitting on the side of the road, so be it. But if that leaves me
hurtling over a cliff... 

BTW - anyone have a &lt;65 body for a bug? I have a great pan, engine,
tranny etc. here, all because of a little brake mishap. :(
