Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifter tapping!

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; 
&gt;     Well, I have ONE hydraulic lifter that taps.
&gt; Sometimes, the tapping is
&gt; really really bad, but after a while, it smooths out
&gt; and goes away after a
&gt; short drive. The lifter seems to lose it's prime
&gt; after only no more than a
&gt; week of inactivity. Tonight I changed the oil, the
&gt; filter, and that little
&gt; black cap thing that comes off and has that metal
&gt; basket in it. I cleaned it
&gt; all and put 2 quarts of 5W-20 and 2 quarts of 5W-30
&gt; Synthetic and the motor
&gt; seemed to run a bit smoother and the rattling was
&gt; far less noticable (to the
&gt; level that it's at where I would basically consider
&gt; it normal).
&gt; 
&gt; The thing is though, I'm wonder if perhaps I need to
&gt; do some sort of
&gt; adjusting. 

I have had 5 engines, all hydraulic, each one wanted
different oil! On some I went to higher viscosity - up
to straight 60 (in summer!!!) and others required
thinner oil to quiet lifters. I think you're on the
right track with experimenting, but I also think you
are way too light and should use a straight 30 as a
starting point. 20/50 seemed to work well most of the
time. (for me - your situation may / will be
different)
