Subject: OT!!! ARGGGG! Re: [T2] Ebay: the polls are in!

This is getting annoying and I don't care and my delete finger is getting 
tired.

Please take this up with the LIST ADMIN OFF LIST.  It is their list and 
their policy.  Why they are letting this OT continue is beyond me.  I am 
sure they will listen to reasonable requests.

Steve
