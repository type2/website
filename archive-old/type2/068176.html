&gt;&gt;Nice post, except for the following part.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Drive with your headlights on at all times on dirt roads.  I drive with my

&gt;&gt;&gt; visible as possible.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Think of what you do when a vehicle has their high beams on comes
&gt;&gt;towards you. You turn your eyes away from the BRIGHT light.
&gt;&gt;...
&gt;&gt;Bright lights are NOT for making yourself visible to others, they're
&gt;&gt;for making the road visible to you.
&gt;
&gt;OK, maybe I should have written the offending suggestion more clearly: I
&gt;intended to indicate that using high-beams during the day is effective when
&gt;driving *off pavement* in a VW bus.

What ever happened to sounding the horn on those twisty roads?  That's
always worked for me.
