Subject: First Engine Pull : Day 1

Hi all,
        
        In a fit of silliness this weekend I pulled my first engine!
Boy what a day that was.  Took me 6-7 hours, taking my sweet time.
You may remember, I had recently been rear ended and had my muffler and
heater box smushed as well as the bumper and back end.  I bought a new
bus sans engine and figure to swap the engine to the unit/unrusty
bus.  First I'll pull the engine, clean up the heads and jugs a
little, replace the push rod tubes and seals, the front and rear oil
seals, check end play, and place it back in the blue bus and if it
still runs when I am done playing with it, I'll pull it again and
place it in the new bus.  That seems like a lot for a first time
engine pull, but then again maybe not.  I've gotten it out and mostly
taken apart.  Just the clutch and flywheel to remove to get at the
front seal.  My first day went like this: 

1) remove bumper and engine lid.
2) drain oil and gas (only spilled a little of both)
3) remove exhaust system
        This didn't work out too well.  Removed all the tin and the
        bolts holding the heat exchangers to the heads.  Couldn't get
        the thing to break loose.  So after beating on the three piece
        unit, I decide the Neanderthal approach is for people with
        more muscle than I (weighing in at only 145 lbs...), so I
        decided to try it piece by piece.  The muffler bolts were
        hard to get to (since it was smushed), but a little patience
        and 30 minutes later, off comes the flattened muffler. Then
        with a little prodding, pulling and another 30 minutes, off
        comes both heat exchangers.  The right one was pretty much
        toast and split open from the accident.  
4) remove and label all electric connections - liberal use of the
        masking tape and mark-all-marker.
5) remove the carbs and the intake manifold
6) remove rear engine tin and oil filler pipe.
        This was made a little difficult by the fact that the rear
        pieces were smushed (I am using that word a lot in this
        story:)   
7) move 3-1/2 ton rolling floor jack and plywood under engine, and
        crank it up under engine.
8) unbolt the two bottom engine bolts (17mm)
9) unbolt the engine mounting bar.
10) remove the top (last) two engine bolts.
11) move the engine around a bit get it even and pull straight back as
        far as it goes.  I look in from the top and the drive shaft
        from the transmition has not yet cleared!  Oh no, the smush in
        the rear doesn't let me pull the engine out far enough to remove it!!!
12) spent a long time trying to figure a way to drop the engine, but
        couldn't clear the drive shaft to save my life, and I could
        have probably done some damage?  we'll have to see.  
13) Remove fan housing and alternator. 
        I had to push the engine back on the transmition, which took a
        while to get that to happen.  While balancing the engine with
        one hand I removed the fan housing and dropped it out the
        bottom.  Next time around I will as a matter of course. remove
        the fan housing prior to unbolting the engine.
14) Drop Engine - 
        With the fan housing off, there was plenty of room to pull the
        engine back.  When I cleared the drive shaft, I lowered the
        engine, jacked the bus up a little bit, and wheeled the engine
        out of the bus into the garage. 

I then cleaned myself up, cleaned the tools up and stood back and
amazed myself with what I had done.  Shaking my head... what have I
done! :)

day two coming up...
