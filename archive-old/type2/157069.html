Subject: Re: [T2] Pentagon Sabotage Explained by Microbus

Wow.  And I thought I spoke English.  I propose a new act of  congress calling our language 'American' to help completely sever our  ties to our English past.  We obvioulsy took a wrong turn sometime  back.  Or maybe it's Maori slang.  Can any of our English  friends offer enlightenment?  Plurry, drongo,   prexie...  Methinks the King would not be pleased! 
  
  Nah.  Three cheers, mate.  (Do they say that in NZ,  too?)  Great way to start a Friday.  I just wonder if Jeb's  daughter is out of rehab.  Cheers....KR

 Pentagon Sabotage Explained by Microbus

Washington DC,  32nd of Octember  --  The fragments photographed in 
the Pentagon soon after the impact on 9/11 are not readily 
recognisable as fragments of an airliner.  Since no such aircraft had 
ever crashed into that particular architecture, we have no precise 
preconception of what the wreckage should look like; but the puzzle 
has been used as a convenient excuse to crank up another paranoid 
'conspiracy' scare.
 One rumour favoured by leading merchants of paranoia is that 
a Raytheon missile, not an airliner, hit the Pentagon that fateful 
morn.  What happened to the airliner and its many passengers is not 
addressed.  The relatives, business contacts &amp; friends waiting for 
the passengers &amp; crew that day are assumed to have too little pull to 
discover the alternate destination (rumoured to have been a grassy 
knoll in the vicinity of Roswell, N.M.).
 Since evidence for the Raytheon or any other missile is 
lacking, a new theory has leaked from the Homeland Security Agency: a 
radio-controlled souped-up VW microbus hurtled into the building, and 
was then detonated by remote radio control.  The only group thought 
to have sufficient command of this arcane type of vehicle is a 
1,000-strong email list codenamed T2.
 The only video of the impact available during investigations 
for the first couple year after the incident were from a slowpoke 1 
frame/s autocam near the gate, which failed to show what type of 
thing impacted.  The HSA has now launched a newly-&quot;discovered&quot; 
broadcast-quality tape which appears to show a Type-2 VW painted with 
marijuarnuh leaves ramming the squat, 60-y-old building and then 
exploding.  Sure enough, sources are citing as confirmatory evidence 
the fact that the wreckage contained no obvious airliner bits.
 One antenna seen on the bus after computer enhancement of the 
newly-disclosed video was just a tad under 13' 6&quot;.  Radio freak 
George Lyle, shadowy 'moderator' of the nonconformist group codenamed 
'Type 2', denied any involvement with this component.

 &quot;This dissident group had come under suspicion for acting 
cooperatively rather than competitively&quot; rasped FBI director Medgar J 
Edgar.  &quot;They tend to help each other, giving advice when they could 
have demanded payment, and even responding to roadside emergencies. 
We therefore had them tentatively taped for comsymps when that was 
the main source of our funding.  But now Islamism has made it harder 
to make out that these VW microbus freaks constitute weapons of mass 
destruction or even local disaster.  We did get overhead imaging of a 
dense smokescreen emitted by one of them in an out-of-town tryout, 
and the odd fire puts the wind up nearby traffic, but the plurry 
things are so unreliable  -  especially the FI models as opposed to 
Solex or Weber versions  -  that no serious terrorist would rely on 
them.&quot;

 Blockbuster novelist Tom Clancy said from his luxury 
residence not a million miles from Langley, Va &quot;My next blockbuster 
will retire John Clark from his long saboteur career in CIA; he will 
become a mellowed-out late-bloomer hippie T2 enthusiast, serving 
voluntarily as our lead profiler at camps, and still packing heat in 
case any jihadist gets the wrong idea from the T2 email list.&quot;

 Quoth former USA prexie Dubya by satellite phone from a T2 
rally 'Buses of the Water' at Lake Taupo, New Zealand: &quot;We're 
grooving on over here with these here May-oh-ryze.  Boy, can they 
sing!  -  even better than our nigruhs&quot; the chipper drongo said. 
&quot;These Kiwi rental splitties are a gas!  They're cruisin' faster, 
cheaper, cooler with no-moving-parts water-injection rigs invented in 
NZ by a T2 fan.  Before I was personoeuvred from the presidency by H 
Rodham Clinton esq, the CIA appreciations on this kiwi inventor 
tentatively postulated comsymp on account his inventions are cheap, 
easy to do yourself, and not patentable  -  undermining capitalism. 
But now we can't pin an Islamist rap on him.  In fact he's here with 
his '73 Devon at Buses of the Water with me &amp; Mrs Bush.  He &amp; I got 
listed in a 'non-profiling' keywords email printout at NSA, and 
before we knew it I had to take refuge with my family in lil' ole Noo 
Zild where the yank-hating Klark regime has withdrawn extradition 
rights for the USA.  Bro Jeb will join us shortly  -  picking up a 
late-model Brazilian T2 in Cuba on his way thru.  Jeb's bringing a 
quad-CHT guage for our host, as a gift to assist his water-injection 
developments.&quot;
