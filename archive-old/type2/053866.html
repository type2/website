&gt;I didn't notice until just now that the rebuilt AVP T4 that I got had a
&gt;different oil pressure sensor than the engine I took out.  The old one had a
&gt;remote pressure sensor with two screw type connectors, that the two

If you have an oil pressure gauge, one wire goes to it and the ather to the
idiot light.  The new sender hooks only to the idiot light.  Get another
sender with two connections.  Is your old one still available?
