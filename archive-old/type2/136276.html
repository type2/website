Subject: Re: [T2] Notes on using a voltmeter on my bus...

&gt; &gt; Now, I was wearing jeans and a long sleeved T-shirt, so my skin wasn't
&gt; &gt; touching anything... But apparently the current was able to pass
&gt; &gt; through my bumper, through my jeans, and to my hand that was holding
&gt; &gt; the lead.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; No way. I'll eat a bus. I don't care how sensitive your instruments are, 12v
&gt; dc is not enough potential. Not even your hand gripping the terminal holding
&gt; the meter probe would do this.
&gt;
&gt; I know electrons personally and they would never walk through that
&gt; neighborhood. Some hang out after the dryer but that's it.

depends on the scale the meter was set for. if it was meg or multiple meg
ohms it could have given confusing readings.
