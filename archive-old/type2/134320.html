Subject: on the right track? adequate list of supplies to kill rust
  bubbles?

Hello listers,
I also posted this Q to the Samba forums so I apologize in advance if
you've already read this there!
I am embarking on my first bit of bodywork. I plan on attacking some
rust bubbles on my 1970 Westfalia. The worst of it is probably above the
left rear wheel in the wheelwell seam, then there is a little nose rust
(OK, bondo cracks), tiny bubbles around a couple dogleg seams, and maybe
a few more here and there. A new battery tray was installed years ago,
but never painted, I just sprayed anti-rust treatment on and underneath
so I will paint that area as well. I am going to use: 

* basic black POR-15 
* PorPatch for filler 
* Marine Clean degreaser 
* 3M &quot;clean and strip&quot; wheels (one more abrasive than the other) 
* sandpaper 
* aerosol can of matching paint (brilliant blue L50H...$38 Cdn!!) 
* masking tape 
* sanding block 
* scraper for the filler 
* 3 small brushes for paint application 
* safety glasses 

My plan is to attack the rusted areas with the clean and strip wheels
until I see bare metal, apply marine clean degreaser, apply POR-15, fill
if necessary, then apply paint when dry to the touch, but still tacky.
For the battery tray I will scrub it on the top and bottom side, apply
marine clean degreaser, then apply POR-15, then apply topcoat possibly
with a brush from some spare paint I have. I would spray it but I'm
afraid it would be difficult masking off the engine compartment while
spraying the battery tray. 

My questions are: 
Am I missing anything that would make the job easier? I have access to
air tools and will be using those for the job. 
What grit paper should I use before applying topcoat? 
Can I just use newspaper to mask off an area for paint? 

Thanks for reading this and any replies! 
Paul
