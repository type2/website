Subject: Re: [T2] Tailgaters

i tottally agree with the slowing down as it is as important to get rid of the ass muncher as it is to tap the brake lights several times.. sooner or later they will get pissed and go around you..

dont slam on the brakes though and piss them off in that way they just might slam the engine up into the back seat for you..
not a good day that would be...

i usually slow down to a crawl though as mentioned to shake um...
although when there is a line in behind you the best thing might be to get off the road a bit and let them all pass and start over..
i have a nice size sticker on my back glass as a warning that i am not getting in a hurry it states..

    55
in 11 minutes.

LOL peace and stay safe out there..
