Subject: RE: [T2] fuel line hoses

Hi Alan,

Unless you have proof that the PO replaced the fuel lines (he told you or he 
has a receipt from a mechanic), you should assume that the fuel lines are 
suspect and should be replaced.  Even if they have been replaced recently, 
double-check that they are not frayed, cut, blemished or otherwise 
compromised.

When I replaced my engine I replaced all my fuel lines with high-pressure FI 
hose, since the original ones were old, rusty, and cracked.  Now, 25,000 
miles later, my engine is out again and I noticed that one of the lines was 
rubbing against the engine tin and was cut almost all the way through.  So, 
even though that line is less than 3 years old, it needs to be replaced.

Plan on getting fuel on yourself during the replacement procedure, so wear 
old clothes and safety goggles -- NO SMOKING!  Also, pull off &amp; cap the 
original lines running from the tank first, leaving the original hoses 
connected to the tank.  Then, replace all the lines with new hose.  Then, 
make the final connection at the tank.  That way you aren't trying to make 
new runs with hoses full of fuel.

Since you have a 1978, you probably have FI.  If so, there's a larger line 
that runs from the fuel filter to the fuel pump (both on driver's side frame 
rail).  I'm not sure what dia that hose is, but it's only about a 4&quot; length, 
so any good FLAPS should have FI-rated hose that size in bulk.

Replace your fuel filter while you're at it, and your Bus will be fuel-safe 
for many happy miles.  Get a fire extinguisher and keep it close at hand, 
just in case you find another poor Bus driver who didn't change his fuel 
lines.

Good luck!
