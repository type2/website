&gt; I decided to change the plugs the other day and was amazed at the carbon

&gt; up to fourth and then it started falling on its face at about 45-50.  So out 
&gt; come the new plugs and once again carbon resin way to black and thick.  It 
&gt; also seems like it's running a little rough. But if you gas it the motor 
&gt; eventually smoothes out.  What gives.  If it was fuel injected I'd try 
&gt; adjustment but with this 2.0 dual carb motor I find it strange that both 
&gt; sides are looking identical in blackness and resin.  Any ideas?  It seems to 
&gt; do OK now at 50 plus miles an hour.

not enough air-flow, perhaps?  I had a similar problem and determined
that my air-filter was clogged (my previous carb used a paper
air-filter)...  By removing the air filter, I was able to drive the
700 miles home without any problems and was able to purchase a new
filter the next day.
