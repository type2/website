&gt; Rob -
&gt;
&gt; I don't know if you can help me. I work for a TV production company in
&gt; Burbank, California. We produce a show for Animal Planet, &quot;The Jeff Corwin
&gt; Experience&quot; and we are looking to hire an old VW Microbus or some other VW
&gt; Camper Van for a shoot in the San Francisco area (around 12 October).
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I was wondering if you might have any information that might help
me
&gt; with this; I would be most grateful.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.
&gt;
&gt; All the best,
&gt;
