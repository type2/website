Subject: [T2] WTB: Child's cot or poles

Hi
  hopefully this message works. Type2 digest first had blank messages, then 
no messages.
   Take 3:
    Wanted to Buy:   Child's cot poles for 79 Westy.  Looking for correct 
poles. Bought 79 Westy w/ brackets already mounted, also have &quot;fabric&quot; for 
cot- but missing poles that slide through.  Willing to buy whole setup if I 
can't find just the poles.
   Thanks
  Brian
