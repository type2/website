COSTCO has some very nice anodized aluminum-framed, padded, folding 
camp/director's chairs.  

They also carry a couple of styles of &quot;hammock chairs&quot; that disassemble and 
fold for storage.

Either type sells for 12 bucks and change.

COSTCO also carries (OBC) some really slick vehicle/boat shelters for an 
amazingly low price.

They currently carry (more OBC) several large but inexpensive tents that look 
like they could be easily modified to snuggle up alongside a Type 2.

The usual elaborate but meaningless and unenforceable disclaimers apply.....

If you check out REI online (and I have no affiliation w/REI and rarely shop
there), they have some folding chairs/camp chairs that are pretty cheap.
We've got something similar and 3-4 of these will tuck underneath the rear
luggage portion of the fiberglass top (71 westy).  I think they're less than
$15 each, but maybe even less now.
