Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

Again...   I can appreciate what you are saying.  If there were people
fighting for this Westy, it would have been bought by now.  There doesn't
seem to be a shortage of them.  I don't see '70 models bringing in a lot of
money, so I don't see it getting me enough green to by say a 63-65.  I think
I'd rather build it up pretty nice (possibly with the pop-up gone) and then
sell it as a '70 model bus.  I don't think it will hurt it's perceived
value, because the guy is giving it up for $400 with a touch of rust now.  I
can see your point, but I don't see $5 difference in it's value in this part
of the world.

-I'm not killing the van, I'm just doing my part to make everyone else's
worth more money.  :-)

&gt;
&gt; Thats going to be a LOT of work!  If the westy is a good deal and NOT what
&gt; you want, get it running and cleaned up, then sell it/trade it for a hard
top
&gt; bus.
&gt;
&gt; Rust free, early bay passenger buses are routinely_parted_out_because just
&gt; don't sell well compared to westfalias and later 2 liter models.  They
&gt; frequently appear in the local u-pull-its with dead engines or transaxles.
&gt; Wait until you find what you really want and put your time and money into
the
&gt; fun aspects of having a bus instead of a huge amount of unecesary body
work!
