Subject: [T2] Westy value?

Hi volks, I have been unsuccessfully tryin' to sell my
westy here in Iowa. Is $3500 to much to ask for a good
condition running westy. I checked NADA book values,
wich I, and dealers in my area go by for used car
values. I always have sold my vehicle this way. The
NADA value for a 79' Westy is 3650 for low retail,
5475 for average, ( wich I think is what my van
qualifies for, actually better for midwest standards!)
and a whopping 8500 for high retail. Whats the opinion
of the list, I posted my van for sale last week and
got good response but, no real serious offers at all.
What give is there a low market in the midwest for
VW's? Am I alone in this desolate state of Iowa. I
never see any good Buses around. I havent lost
interest in VW's just my westy. I just want a non-pop
top van for cruising in. Anyway sorry for the lenghth,
just frusrated here. Thanks for listening, or reading
I guess.
