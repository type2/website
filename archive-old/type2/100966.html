&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Should ignition time be set according to your engine code as in the Bentley?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Iginition timing should always and everywhere be set to match the
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; at least most of the time  ;8*}
&gt; 
&gt; I am sorry, I but I am confused.  When should ignition timing be set to
&gt; anything other than the distributor?  or where?  Do you mean he should be
&gt; setting his timing to match the block number?  Do you mean that he should
&gt; be setting it to match his carb?

remember the looooong discussion on this some time back, you would set
timing different say if you had changed the cam, or switched to/from FI to
carbs because of different curves, now you should also change the dizzy
too but doesn't always happen, and then there is the .009
