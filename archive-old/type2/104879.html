Subject: Re: [T2] singleport doghouse pix

You painted it the colour of the French Flag!
Oops the Freedom Flag? hooray pour le dave fou d'oncle
This is pretty much my sort of engine. Simple and SP.
I might do a T4 cooler or 911 pulley because I live so far south and even
a few degrees of cooling makes summer xway driving nicer.
Did you use the dished pistons?


&gt; It's assembled on the bench, a couple minor details left to go on and in she
&gt; goes. This was one of the easiest 'modified' engines I've worked with, all
&gt; parts just bolted into place and I didn't have to reengineer anything.  A
&gt; couple pix can be seen at
