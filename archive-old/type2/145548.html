&gt; Thanks for all the suggestions. My neighbor gave me another one to pass

&gt; I'll be keeping a six pack of &quot;good&quot; beer in there with the reciept.  I

&gt; better pay them off with the good stuff. :)

The problem is that a lot of losers will likely find the sixer, consume it
in place, and then trash your bus.

Leaving a vehicle unattended for a long period in any public place is
never a good idea, particularly if it starts to look unattended.  Keep the
vehicle clean if possible and make it look like it has been recently
driven.  If this is not possible, make it obviously undrivable,
perhaps by removing a wheel.  This is assuming that it is OK to leave the
vehicle there long-term in the first place.
