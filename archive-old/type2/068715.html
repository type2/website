Subject: Re: More electrical problems...

Jon,
  To address this problem methodically, I would check one component after
another. Start with the battery: The fact that the lights are still on
doesn't mean squat, the starter is MUCH more demanding than the
lights...Take out the battery, clean the terminals, then trickle charge it
over night. Take it to Les Schwab, have them do a load test. It's free. Then
either buy a new battery or reinstall the charged old one. Before
reinstallation, clean the terminals, both at the battery and on the cables.
If the problem persists, I'd investigate the condition of the brushes in the
alternator. Heck, while you have the alternator out, replace the brushes
anyway.
They're, like, 1$ a pair...Check it's bearings while you're at it. Have the
alternator tested at your local FLAPS,
also free ususally. Reinstall. If problem persists: Get back to us!
  Hope you've got better whether than we do...It's been pouring here for 36
hours now...
  Ciao,

             &gt; Yes, following on from my lighting saga (and all those
other










sagas &gt; Bob!), I've now got the most serious problem with my freshly restored
&gt; '68 yet!
&gt;
&gt; OK, so here's the deal;
&gt;
&gt; - Sometimes when I'm driving along, the red light comes on very dimly,
&gt; seems to stay on for a while then go off.
&gt;
&gt; - from time to time the thing won't start, and I jump it and take it for
&gt; a long ol' hike to re-charge.
&gt;
&gt; - Saturday, I took off the earth strap and cleaned the connections -
&gt; tried to get the positive off too, but to no avail - locked solid; Q -
&gt; any tips for undoinfg this, apart from those in Muir - it seems the bolt
&gt; won't move AT ALL!
&gt;
&gt; - Until yesterday, none of this was a problem, but yesterday, the light
&gt; came on with a vengance - very brightly, the lights on the dash dimmed,
&gt; the stereo went off...I panicked!  I decided to turn round and go home
&gt; at the next round about - the round about was fairly tight, and I tookit
&gt; quite quickly.  As I did so, the light went off, and everything seemed
&gt; normal.
&gt;
&gt; - I arrived at my destination, and left the bus for 10 mins.  Came back
&gt; and it wouldn't start.  On turning the ignition, got a grunt or two,
&gt; then nothing.  The battery seemed fine though, as the lights were bright
&gt; as hell.
&gt;
&gt; This means that the bus is just about unuseable as it stands - if I do
&gt; go somewhere, chances are I won't get back!
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas about the cause of this - the fan belt seems OK, but I
&gt; wouldn't know if it had too much play - has about 1cm at present - *is*
&gt; this OK?
&gt;
&gt; Your halp is appreciated, as always...
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Jonathan.
