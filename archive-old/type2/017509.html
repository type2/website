Its simple.  Why is everything an argument.  I was just putting the info up
b/c its friday and I found that perhaps some other Midwesterners would
benefit from the info.  For those who just have to have ALL the information
for some reason.  the items were about the same I got exhaust parts from
SoCal and the poptop seal and some other body parts from Bus Depot.  Who
actually thinks that shipping is primarily a function of weight anyways??? 
I know if i order about a ton of parts that it will be more, but come on...
 I said in the earlier post that the parts amounted to about the same
weight/size class.  Its primarily a function of distance.  Socal is farther
than Bus Depot and that saves money for Midwesten bus fanatics.  As far as
time for shippment goes.  SoCal &quot;forgot&quot; to tell me that half of my order
was backordered.  It took a mont for my carbs to arrive.  i had to call
four times and got vague guesses everytime as to when I would get my parts.
 Bus depot told me when to expect my parts (one week)  and they came six
days later.  I hope thats enough info for whoever cares.  Anyways For us
folks in the MidWest its a good option and owing to their great costomer
service, I don't mind plugging the Bust Depot.  8 or 30 bucks...its your
choice....shop wisely

PS
Anyone who can't wait a few days for car parts should drive a buick
