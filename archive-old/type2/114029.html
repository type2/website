Subject: Sunroof idea's for 71 bus

Hi all,

I'm new here to the mail list and wanted to run something by you all. I 
have a 71 westfalia and just recently had to remove the entire pop-top 
setup because it was very unsafe to drive down the freeway with it since it 
was in really bad shape. I've decided not to replace the pop-top and 
instead keep it a sunroof. I'm searching for an original VW sliding sunroof 
assembly but haven't gotten any leads yet. So, I've been thinking about 
making my own rag-top cover for it and thought I'd ask around and see if 
anybody here has done that and could give me some pointers about materials, 
etc. I couldn't find any info in the type2 archives. I was thinking about 
making a snap-on cover since there are already holes drilled all around the 
opening where the pop-top canvas was attached to the roof. I figured I 
could buy those screw-in snap bottoms (like the ones for the back bug 
screen) and install them all the way around and all I'd need to do is make 
the cover and install the other half of the snaps around that. I just don't 
know where to buy canvas material and the snaps. Or maybe there is a better 
alternative? Any info or help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks very much!

~G
