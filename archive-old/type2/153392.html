Subject: Re: [T2] high octain gas

I record every single fill up ... I record odometer reading, # of litres of 
gas, and $. Every single fill up. On both my 60 and my 78.

Prior to my motor rebuild I'd run 87 octane for a bunch of fill ups then I'd 
fill up with 91 octane for a while and compare - I'd get 3 to 4 mpg more 
with the 91 octane in my type 1 motor and slightly less than that with my 
type 4 motor. I never bothered to calculate cents or dollars per mile with 
87 vs. 91 .. so I can't speak to that .. but for sure the price difference 
isn't as much as it seems given you travel further on a litre of 91 than you 
do on 87.

 gas.  He said that it
&gt; plays an important role in keeping the engine cool.  What's the story?
