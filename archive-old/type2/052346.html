Subject: [T2] Heading For Maine!!!

Hello Everyone--

Well just wanted to thank everyone for all the help these past couple weeks. 
Heading for Maine this afternoon--looking to make the trip in a couple days 
but no need to rush. Have my AIRS list in hand and the bus is running 
good--just have to beat the next NorEaster heading for the Northeast. Thanks 
again for all the help--and maybe I'll catch you on the road---Adam
