&gt;Question: Are such things symptomatic of a bad relay, or a dying switch?
&gt;Looks to me like replacing that switch would be a bitch, even if I did have
&gt;one laying around, because of all those little connections you would have
to
&gt;solder.


A bad relay can do this.  So can a bad switch.  So can bad wiring -
especially coming from the relay.  If your bus is anything like most of them
that I have owned - the relay is probably bouncing around behind the dash.
If so, you may have broken one / some of the wires coming from the relay.
Did you happen to notice if your headlights come on when you are HOLDING the
blinker/dimmer switch up?

&gt;Bonus question: What could I have possibly done that would suddenly make
the
&gt;headlight dimmer switch fire when I turn the ignition key?


Sounds like you may have created a short between the power coming into the
dimmer switch with the lead going to the relay.  If you activate the dimmer
switch (with the ignition on) does the relay still react?
