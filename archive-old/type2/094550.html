Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Isolator Problem

One advantage i have is that mine is a westy.  I am using the bottom of 
the sink cabinet for the relay, fuse panel, and switch.  Even with that 
mounting area it was a challenge to mount that switch.

&gt;&gt; I have mine set up with the heavy duty RV one like yours.  I have also

&gt; ==========================&gt;
&gt; I have one of those switches, and have not installed it.
&gt; I cannot decide just exactly where and how to mount said big switch.
