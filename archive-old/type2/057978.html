Brian,

&gt;               |                                       |
&gt;               5                   or                  5
&gt;         TDC       10                             10       TDC
&gt;
&gt;Which is after and which is before?  If the crank turns clockwise I say the
&gt;first is before.  

The diagram on the left is BEFORE.

If you put a mark on your timing wheel at TDC and adjust the wheel so
that it is straight up (TDC) then move the wheel 5 degrees clockwise,
the mark will be to the right of center and 5 degrees AFTER TDC.
