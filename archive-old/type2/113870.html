&gt;Anybody remember the 'Freeze12' discussions a few years ago?  Did anyone take the plunge?

Yes I did.  I ran it for two years in my Mustang with no trouble, and last year I ditched 134a in my bus (which had been working acceptably) and replaced with Freeze-12 (I use ester oil in that system).  I noticed a slight improvement in cooling and have experienced no problems thus far.
