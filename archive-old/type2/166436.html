Subject: wreck

Well, it happened to me today.  It was raining really hard as I was bringing my 84 year old mother from the doctor's office back to assisted living.  She was on the bench seat in the back, my dog in the front.  2 houses before her home, in a slight curve, I saw this girl skidding toward me.  I swerved, but she got me right around the left front headlight.  As you can see in the pic, it didn't do a whole lot of damage to my vehicle but hers was pretty bad.   Luckily, my mom saw it coming as I did and braced herself.  I thought sure they were going to take her to the hospital, but she refused.  It could have been MUCH worse.  I'm going to go find some Jetta seat belts this week.  Don't know what I'll be able to get out of this from her insurance.   I would hope to get at least a good start on a paint job.  I'm expecting to need get screwed.  

Until I replace either my monitor or graphics card, all pics on my computer are too dark.  Let me know if you can see these.

Now, what to do about the rear piece that's rusted out?

Now I need two bumper guards.  One that got smashed and knocked off in the wreck and one that came off of the back a while back.  Don't know what happened to it.  Are they all the same?  And are the front and rear bumpers the same? 

Thanks.  Still shaking....KR
