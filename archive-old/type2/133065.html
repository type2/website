Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust inside the bus

Alex,

Let's think this through slowly....

Getting exhaust inside the bus can only come from one place...your engine.

You already said that you can hold something over the tailpipe and the 
engine would die fairly quickly...ok, so theoretically all of your exhaust 
system is &quot;tight&quot;....however, you can still have an exhaust system leak(a 
small one) and get the engine to die this way.

Try doing the test again while you lay under the engine listening for 
any leaks(just to double check).
Assuming that this test is still good and you don't hear exhaust coming 
out *anyplace* else, you have proved to yourself that *all* of the exhaust
is going out the tail pipe.

Alex, I don't think that you ever said that the exhaust smell is worse at 
speed or when stopped....in any event, now go get some sort of pipe that 
will fit tightly over the exhaust pipe and direct the exhaust either more 
to the passenger side or pointing to the passenger side and retry your 
tests.

Hoepfully, if you get the exhaust far enough into the air stream(at 
speed), the smell should go away...if it doesn't...welllllll something 
else is seriously wrong.  If it does, then you have proved one of two 
things...you still have a hole into your bus someplace, and secondly
the exhaust system you have has a problem....there have got to be 
a bunch of busses out there that bad seals, but a good exhaust system
and those people are not reporting serious exhaust smell.

Something is weird here!

Cheers, dave
