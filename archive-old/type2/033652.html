&gt; You are right, I've only seen 7 buses around the DC area at the most.

also in the DC area, and Baltimore more often is my Blue and White 78,
easy to spot because a canoe lives on the roof.   also in this area is a
pastel blue and off white non pop top westy, and a genuine hippy wagon,
flowers et all.  have no clue as to original color, owned by an artist.
also seen frequently is a double cab splity all white and appears to
actually be used by a house painter.   few others I see in passing.
