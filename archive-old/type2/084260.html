&gt;Depends on how you used the name IMHO.  The hubcaps were probably genuine 
&gt;vw from old cars...yes?  So it's not like you made the hubcaps with the vw 
&gt;emblem and tried to pass them off as genuine.
&gt;
&gt;Better get a lawyer though.

Yes, lawyer, yes. Don't just fork out the dough.. VW got their money 
from the original sale of said hubcap, and what you do with it after 
that is not up to them. Also, it's art. This is exactly the same as me 
going to a junkyard and buying a hubcap, except this time i buy it from 
you and it comes with a clock. And last time i checked, vw doesn't still 
make hubcaps for our busses, so it's not like they're losing any sales.
So get a lawyer, see what he says. Maybe you'll be the guy that stops 
them in their quest to keep us from having parts.
