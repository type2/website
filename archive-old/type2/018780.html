Subject: follow up on so I need a new engine
Message-ID: &lt;378BCA4C.5EBC5E74_at_uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

First off...Thanks to all who replied.  I got a lot of great advice that
helped save me some bread.  The engine on it now has 160K on it.  I
called the mechanic up and asked him exactly why he decided it was time
to put the old engine to rest.  He gave me the numbers of the
compression test.  85, 85, 80, 90.  From what I've been told this all is
really low.  He told me all that he could fix the problems ( push rods,
fly wheel, valve covers, cylinders, and a few other things ) but that
would just be a band aid on a sore that really needs stitches.  I called
a local VW club and found out that the mechanic is really good but
really expensive.  The bright side is that they also told me that he
could be talked down.  Anyway to make a long story short I was able to
get the guy down to $2000 installed.  This is still a bunch of bread but
if I really need the work done than it may be worth it.

Thanks again to all who helped.
