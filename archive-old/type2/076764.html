&gt; I've been reading some of the things posted on the list about GEX.  All of 
&gt; them have been bad comments.  I was looking at there website b/c I need a 
&gt; new engine for my bus. After what I heard I don't think I will buy from them 
&gt; but could someone tell where I could get a good 2 liter from for my 72 bus.

first you need a core or old motor... check junk yards etc, sometimes
folks here have blown engines that are basically decent they let go cheap.

now that you have a core.  check your wallet.  how much work are you
willing or able to do yourself....
figure a two liter rebuild from a decent core will run you at least
$1200-1500 base and go up as you do other jobs or farm out some of the
work.

to give you an idea, about year and a half ago I rebuilt mine.  cleaned
case. balanced crank. new cam, new pistons and cyl.  all new bearings etc.
had the heads cleaned and new seats and valve guides installed. lot of
little things that added up.

paid to have the bottom end done by a good machinist with VW
experience. did the top end myself..._dot_came up just short of $2,500

I hope to get at least 100k miles on this engine before major work needs
to be done again...
