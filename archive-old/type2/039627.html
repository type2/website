Subject: Re: Pertronics adjustment

Doktor,

I, after mucking around with Neandereer points on my 83, decided to install
the Pertronix.

Points Suck, as does the FLAPS that sold me a defective condenser. (City
Foreign Auto, Asheville-NC)

When I installed the Pertronix, the only variance from the initial setup,
after timing, was the Dwell. I could not get the same dwell. I did not try
to adjust the clearance of the ring and igniter, however, because it ran so
well.

I suspect, as the other gentleman mentioned, that there is a defect in the
vacuum advance mechanism.

My Pertronix still function perfectly after 6,000 miles. But I still carry a
set of points and condenser in the glove box.

&gt; &gt;I just installed a Pertronics Ignitor in my 72 type 4 dual vacuum
&gt; &gt;distributer. It seems to work fine except that I can't get the same
timing
&gt; &gt;spread I got when it had points. Before it idled at around 4 degrees ATDC
&gt; &gt;and tops out at about 38 degrees BTDC. Now in order to get the 38 degrees
&gt; &gt;of advance needed to run normally I have to advance everything and end up
&gt; &gt;with 4 degrees BTDC at idle, an 8 degree difference from before. Is there
a
&gt; &gt;reason for this?
&gt;
&gt; Yes, wizband non stock add on not properly designed (Neandereered).
&gt;
&gt; &gt;What can I do to make the timing spread more normal?
&gt;
&gt; Go back to stock Neandeerered design or put nore time/money into
&gt; experimentation with a further variety of non stock modifornications.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;What would be the highest advance I could run without overheating or
&gt; &gt;otherwise damaging the engine?
&gt;
&gt; Bentley provides the specs for the stock motor. If the full range of
&gt; advance varies from stock anywhere along it's climb through the RPM's,
&gt; expect either less power somewhere or more stress for the motor..........
&gt; or both.
