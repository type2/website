Subject: re: HELP, stuck coupler bolt

Hi Chip,

You've certainly got a move on with this...

&gt;From memory the bolt slides through a split cylinder which you will have 
previous inserted from the other side of the coupler. The threads of the bolt 
then go into something which is not much more than a washer that sits in the 
bell end of the split cylinder. Please jump on me if I've remembered wrongly.

                     ......split cylinder
                     v                 _
      washer...&gt;|  \________________  | | 
                |       ______________|_|
               \\\\\\\\\______________| |&lt;.....bolt
                |   ________________  |_|
                |  /                  |_|

If the bolt is stuck half in and half out of the split cylinder then the split
cylinder will need to be opened out to allow further progress of the bolt.
Try a screw driver in the gap and tap the end with a hammer to use the wedge
shape to open it out; at the same time try to turn the bolt to get the threads 
to draw it in.

Or (rather more desparate) try tapping the bolt head with your hammer (no access
so put a metal bar on the head, support the other end, then whack the bar) this 
should push the split cylinder out the other side where the split can be opened 
out a bit then turn the bolt to draw it back.

Good luck

Bob
