Subject: Barndoor Sighting!!

Hi Listees,

Went to London today to pick up Damon's American Racing Wheels
from a friend of a friend (for Damon's '59 bug -- welding is complete,
awaiting paint :-)

Well, this guy, Julian, asked if I had a VW, told him about Splitty,
and he says &quot;oh, I've got one of them, a '54&quot;. When he saw my jaw
drop he said we could go &amp; see it. It's a bit of a shed (probably dire
by US standards, but Everything is restorable in England!), but it's
complete (apart from rear lights &amp; semaphores).

Both wheel arches rusted out, rear hatch hanging off (P.O. tried to
fix is with a piano hinge stuck on the *outside*!), bottom foot of nose
panel isn't there. It's a panel. Sides are v. straight. Best thing about
it is that it's RHD -- most of the Barndoors in the country are Swedish
imports. This one came from New Zealand, cost 500 NZ dollars, but
shipping was a killer. Also (and here's lesson to be learnt), it was
bought from photos which showed a stack of parts inside the bus
(spare bumpers etc.). When it arrived it was empty. PLUS Julian
paid for a container for the shipping, which, it transpired, was also
filled with jet-skis. The shipping company must have made double
on that one.

On the &quot;Ever Lived In Your Bus?&quot; theme: Round the corner from this
Barndoor (which was parked in a lock-up garage complex) I spotted
the rear end of another splitty (post '64). As I walked over to check
it out, Julian called me back. He told me on the way back to his 
workshop that a 'recluse' actually lives in the bus permanently, &amp; he 
doesn't take kindly to weirdos peering into his home &amp; asking him why 
he hasn't restored it :-) Apparently it's the straightest original bus, &amp; 
he's the only known person in the country who lives in a split bus.
