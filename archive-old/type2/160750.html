Subject: Vanagon jump seats

	Just got back from ABC Used Auto Parts in Colorado Springs.  Picked  
up a set of Vanagon front seats for $25 that are in very descent  
shape.  In any case, there are two jump seats, a full rear bench with  
all three head rests....all with fabric that is not torn and foam  
that has no issues. If the pair of front seats went for $25, I can't  
imagine the other seats being much more.  Thought I would post for  
any others looking to put in jump seats or what not.  Maybe someone  
could forward to the vanagon list?

Oh yes, the engine is there too and it looks like it has not been  
picked over.  I think they said it was an 84.
