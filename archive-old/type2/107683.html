Subject: loss of power and really bad sound

On the way home from work my 71 westy had an event which occurred very
rapidly.  Sudden loss of power but the engine still ran and the ride got real
rough and noisy.  No engine lights came on but the engine is really running
rough and power is down considerable, Checking the engine no overt oil leaks
or anything looking peculiar noted.  Any suggestions on where to start, valve
maybe?
Thanks
