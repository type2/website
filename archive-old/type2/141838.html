Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Sending Unit/ Oil Leak

&gt; Starting with the OSU. I got it off and found that the plastic part 
&gt; with the connector sticking out of it spins in place. Is that normal 
&gt; or do I need to replace it? I don't really think that this is my leak, 
&gt; however, because the OSU was tight in the case, and it doesn't seem 
&gt; that that much oil would escape through the loose plastic part. I'm 
&gt; thinking that I should look at the oil pump next??? Maybe the oil 
&gt; cooler???

Hi George,

Look at the fan crank seal, also.

Jeff
