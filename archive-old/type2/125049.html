Subject: Weird engine meltdown... Attn: Bob MacD and Jake Raby

Just a thought here, where is the vacuum pick up for the brake booster and
auto trans on the bus???
If it's near No 1 and there is a small leak in the line it will cause that
cylinder to run lean and possibly start to seize if driven hard or with a
heavy load.
