	Yikes!  Don't try this at home kids!
	You won't need any gas fumes to make an explosion, the hydrogen
coming
	from the battery will do just fine.  Sparks near the battery are a
Bad
	Thing.  Also, if you ever disconnect the battery, take off the
ground
	strap, not the positive.  That way, if you touch the wrench against
the
	engine or the body, it doesn't matter.

	Very good point Dave.  Using the negative clamp against the body is
a much better idea if you don't have an ammeter.  Better still, another wire
off the negative post against the body away from the engine bay entirely.
Really pulled a Homer on that one.  Funny how you get into a bad habit when
you're young and foolish and it sticks with you long after you know better.

	Thanks,

	Alan
