andy,

i thought about re-installing the seat on the other side, but i decided 
i would rather have the space for 'stuff'.  i am an avid mountain biker, 
and i can put my bike in the van fully assembled much easier this way.
and i very seldom carry more than a few people with me; the seat was 
unecessary.

a side benefit:  i think the weight distribution is better now.  the big 
wooden cabinet on the right seems to balance the icebox unit pretty 
well, at least better than having both on the same side.
