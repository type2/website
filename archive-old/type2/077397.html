&gt; Not a chance that it's from a 914.  All 914-4's had type IV motors.  70-72 were
&gt; 1.7 only, 73-74 were either 1.7 or 2.0 and 75-76 were either 1.8 or 2.0.  All
&gt; Bosch d-jet fuel injected.

That's not entirely true. Most were Jetronic D. The 74 1.8 and the 75 1.8
were Jetronic L however.
