Subject: RE: [T2] The Woes of the Fuel Filter Change

I especially like the part when it runs down
your arm into your armpit.

I have a set of old coveralls hanging in my shop
that are used just for this purpose.  There's
someone on the list that mentioned that they had
installed shut-off valves to make engine removal
easier, maybe you can put one between the tank
and the filter.=20

&gt; Hi,
&gt; Can anyone tell me a way to change my fuel filter without=20
&gt; getting a full
&gt; stream of gas pouring out onto my chest from the fuel tank=20
&gt; line?  Out of all
&gt; the jobs one has to do on a bus, I dislike this one the most.=20
