1976 transporter/camper converted, 1800 engine, weber 32/36 carb
   
  ok so i have been having some major issues with running hot lately....
  things i have done and results
   
  dwell/new points set at 22 *****200 miles later they are running at 24
   
  timing is 7.5 BFTDC
   
  compression is as is after sitting and cooling off for 6 hours 
   
  #1 110  ,#2 120 ,#3 115 ,#4 115
   
  ok running through everything and coming up with nothing a friend suggested that a chipmunk cute as they are might have got inside the  engine and made a nest or something blocking the oil cooler??? or around heads..?(and i have seen a cute little chipmunk in the carport form time to time.... but bus never sits more than a day if that....if i dont just go get a paper that day it still usually gets drove everyday but that might not matter maybe to a chipmunk finding my cold engine one night while i count sheep...?
   
  or?? something came through fan and sucked in there blocking it off..oil cooler or around heads???? i tried with my mirror and light...but couldnt see in there that far without blinding that one eye and seeing purple...
   
  i may have to drop engine wednesday night and see if there is anything under the tin ,,,, but before that one more time wanted to throw this out there to the list in hopes someone might have a  idea of what is causing me to burn points so fast and whats running me so hot...?
   
  valves are all fine as well.....???
  _____________________________________________-
   
  in the midst of all this i checked voltage etc.... found some confusing things..
   
  igintion coil shows with key on bus not running 11 1/2 volts
   
  bus off the battery it' s self shows 14 volts
   
  buttttttttttttt now when bus is running i check coil and it only shows 8 1/2 volts??
   
  is that right..? i thought it should be running at 12 - 14?
   
  i know this isnt causing to run hot but could be something to do with my power issue? i have a loss of power on hills and start offs... i can sail/cruise once up to speed but still feel the loss in power....
   
  or is the loss of power be contributed to the running hot....?
  just IMO nothing i know for sure but seems that when bus runs hot that there is the loss of power then, but i cant say for sure if it is just when its hot or all the time... but i do notice more when hot....?
   
  thanks for any info or anything that can help me better determine whats wrong here with both voltage and very much so the heat...  ..wasnt but mid 80's today and on a very short drive she stuttered when cut off cause she was hot as she always does only when hot ...and the oil temp gauge shot way up little over 220 in no time at all... 5= minutes later i mean and very abnormal for my temp gauge and bus...never gets that high....
   
  also the engine has only 11,000 miles on it as of tonight....
