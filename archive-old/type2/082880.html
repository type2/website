 Gary has hit the nail on the head.
Besides, the original idea came from a concept where all participants had to have a receipt from the boneyard where they bought the bus, possibly with photos to prove its decrepitude or documents &amp; photographic proof of the fact it had spent more than 2 years off the road due to it's extremely poor condition.
We're not talking rare buses or ones that have just run out of rego &amp; someone has got the most money they can get from the local scrap metal dealer simply because they couldn't bother to find the bus a better home or spend the money on new rego.............we're talking serious junkheaps that have some big rust problems or chassis warping being welded up in a rather ugly but functional manner for some good, not so clean, wholesome fun.
Besides, every other brand or model of car has some sort of Fender Bender action so why not buses?
Do you think people cry foul at all those old sedans that they sledge hammer back into shape after each race?
Cheers

Do you think we are such BAD drivers that we would purposely crash? This is only for busses that are almost beyond saving. A lot of us have hulks in the backyard that are beyond repair or have been scavenged for parts.  We can't bring ourselves to take the rusted hulk to the crusher. At least by building a racing sledge, the beast could get a few more years of life. See http://www.needforspeed_dot_ca/stevefeature.asp to see how some people are building remarkable raceable sleds.If you can't see the humor in the group then I can't help you.----- Original Message ----- From: java1972bg_at_aol_dot_com To: garyw_at_fatmedia_dot_com Sent: Wednesday, March 20, 2002 7:05 AMSubject: Re: [T2] Boneyard bus racing
What is the point in beating up the busses anymore. If you are a true vw fan you would save them not destroy them. Think about it.
