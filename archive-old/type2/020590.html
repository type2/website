Subject: exhaust leak


Hello fellow listees, I have two bus problems going on.
1. My mech has diagnosed an exhaust leak and I need to get a new exhaust
manifold (at least that is what he called it) meaning the first section
of pipe coming out of the engine.  He said to get both sides since when
one side goes the other soon follows suit.  He is unable so far to
locate the parts; I did find some available thru Reborn Parts but before
I order them they need to know the shape of the ports?  They said they
would be either triangular, square or oval.  I know one of you guys know
the answer!  I have a 78 California spec bus.
2.  When I go out to drive first thing in the morning they bus going
into reverse and I can back out fine.  But then I put it into first and
go to give it some gas and it accelerates VERY SLOWLY, which is made
worse by giving it more gas and sometimes giving it more gas will even
make it stall out.  Then when this happens it is very hard to start
again.  This morning on my way to get coffee this happened and I was
blocking traffic and lots of pissed off people where honking at me
because obviously honking has been proven to help cars/busses start
faster, right?  I hate people who honk at stalled vehicles!  Anyway, I
did get it started and it ran fine after that.  
Any help you can give would be very appreciated.

                                        Peace and Busses,
                                        Beth and Prudence, the green 78
                                        bus in NJ
