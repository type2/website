Subject: Synthetic Oil

     Hey, I decided to try some of this stuff, so I got some Mobil
synthetic 15w-50 and replaced the straight 50wt Valvoline I was using.
At zero, the engine cranks right over, so that part of it is great, but
I notice that when driving around town, the oil temp never seems to go
above 120-130. I went out of town aways, maybe 5 miles at 55, and it
still never got over 150, and outside air temp was maybe 20.
     Now, of course, it's cold out (and I was laid up for a few weeks
recovering from surgery, so didn't drive my bus for a long time so I
can't directly compare what the regular oil would do in these temps, and
never had a oil temp gauge in winter before,) but I'm a little worried.
Don't mind seeing those low temps, but I'm wondering if it's an accurate
reading. Anybody else up north see that sort of temp??
       Maybe synthetics are the way to go -- if it doesn't start leaking
again, anyway.
