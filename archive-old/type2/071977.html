&gt;unmoved by this loss. OK.  Let's check No. 4 again.  Huh?  Last time the
&gt;
&gt;revs dropped when I took it off but now it is unmoved by this loss as
&gt;well. Where
&gt;has all my beautiful vacuum gone? Now reading 12&quot; at idle Where will it
&gt;all end?

I bet the idle cutoff solenoid on that side became plugged again.  The
vacuum dropped because the RPMs dropped due to only two cylinders firing.
Loosen the solenoid slightly while the engine is running and I bet your 3&amp;4
will magically start firing again.  Clean/replace the solenoid and your
troubles will be over... temporarily.  Those things are so trouble prone -
they clog *all* the time.

And you should probably get some bigger air correction jets.  I run 155's
with the same 2-liter engine and carbs.  Probably won't make a huge
difference but it might help a little.  What size are your main jets?  I
recommend running 132.5s - seems to give a decent a/f ratio.
