Subject: Stalls at Idle; Until It Warms Up?

Hello All,

This weekend I drove my '74 Westy about 550 miles round trip from Nashville
Tennesse to Blue Ridge Georgia.  My wife and I drove through over the
mountain (or at least they are to people from Florida) roads and through
dirt switchbacks without a single problem.  The drive home went just as
smooth and included several stops once back in town to complete errands.  On
the way to work this morning, the Bus would stall whenever it was given the
opportunity to idle.  It continued to perform well at cruising speed.  When
I got off from work, I went to pick it up and it did the same to me.  Then,
about the time I nursed it home (seriously, as I was backing into the
driveway) it idled just fine.

I tried to duplicate the problem by letting it cool, then restarting and by
reving the RPM's for a minute or two and then returning to idle, but could
not make the problem reoccur.

Suffered a mild heart attack a little earlier.  Read about a similar problem
on the archives where they tested the cutoff valve by disconnecting the wire
(connecting coil and carb) and touching it against the screw listening for a
click.  I accidentally touched the carb and everything came to a stop.  Was
in quite the panic until I found a blown fuse.  I tried disconnecting the
wire from the coil and touching it to see if I could hear a noise, but
really couldn't hear anything (how much noise is that going to make).

The engine is a 1978 2.0 L with a Weber carb.

What is this?  How do I fix it?  How do I keep it from returning?

I can't believe how many questions I have.  But I really do appreciate all
of your patience and help.

Thanks,

Darrin K. Pierce
