Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: Cold wether starting

&gt; This was a very
&gt; common thing to do up north in the 1950. Then we would also boil the
&gt; antifreeze to help start the car.
&gt;

I was just complaining this morning that I'll need to upgrade the battery in
my Volvo because it barely turns the engine over at sub-freezing temps. You
know, like 25* F?

:-^

-42 is just WAY too cold even for me who grew up going to the beach year
round in Cali.

*shudders*
