&gt; They also caution that the adjusting screw on the linkage
&gt; arm (fast idle screw) should not touch the fast idle cam
&gt; when the choke is off. The throttle plate should be closed.
&gt; If not, you by-pass the idle circuit and the carb will not
&gt; work properly. The carb is made to adjust from the idle
&gt; circuit to the progressive circuit ports above the closed
&gt; throttle plate. With out the proper transition from idle to
&gt; acceleration, you get a flat spot.


They must also want to sell a lot of carbs for their advertisers.

If the butterfly valve contacts and rests on the carb bore, the 
sharp edged steel butterfly valve will quickly wear a groove
into the soft aluminum carb body, destroying any pretense
of a smooth idle or idle transition.

Turn in the fast idle screw until it just touches, then 1/2 to 1 more
turn. That will make the gap small enough not to leak, but the carb
spring will put force on the fast idle screw, not the carb bore.
