Subject: Re: [T2] spare tire and bus jack

Well I hate to, but I have to disagree here becuase I don't want someone
else to be unhappy.

I ordered the &quot;white with black piping&quot; spare tire cover from Bus Depot and
it does NOT fit good. It is too big around for the stock 14&quot; tire on my '72
and looks baggy. It is not a snug fit.

On a positive note Bus Depot now sells the Vanagon scissor jack that will
work on your bus and much better than stock. If you aren't going original I
would recomend it.

From their website:


Genuine VW scissors jack - fits stock jackpoints but much more stable than
orig style! Depot exclusive! (Not for Vanagon w/plastic rocker moldings)
click for picture $34.95  $0.00  237 011 031


They also got my last order out within 3 days, and all parts there (after I
called and made them swear they had the parts in stock). I had bad
experiences with them before. This time I checked 4 different suppliers. Bus
Depot had the best price on everything, but only 1/2 was in stock. I only
ordered what they had in stock and got the rest from GoWesty. I was pleased
this time around.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;ALSO... Spare tire cover...I have the nose mounted
&gt; &gt;arrangement but the cover is wasted. I want to replace
&gt; &gt;the cover. I figured I would cut a round piece of
&gt; &gt;plywood and glue it to the inside of a new black vinyl
&gt; &gt;cover and then mount the VW emblem back on. I believe
&gt; &gt;that I did this way back in the early '80s on another
&gt; &gt;bus I owned. Anyone have a source for the black vinyl
&gt; &gt;tire cover?? It would be cool to find one with a VW
&gt; &gt;emblem printed on already!
&gt;
&gt; I believe it's Bus Depot that carries the black covers and the
&gt; white-with-black-piping covers. They fit very nicely, and it would be
quite
&gt; easy to spraypaint a vw logo on (with a carefully crafted stensil) or even
&gt; take a real metal emblem and bolt it on. They're pretty cheap, as I
recall,
&gt; and look great.
