Subject: Trouble unlatching sliding door

The Wonderbus's sliding door is getting darn hard to open from the 
outside, and effectively impossible to open from the inside. A lot of 
force needs to be applied to turn the lever far enough to get the latch 
to unlatch.  Once unlatched, it slides fore and aft just fine.

Seeking hints on how to club this problem into submission quickly.
