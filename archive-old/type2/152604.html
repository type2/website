Subject: PLF VW /Paypal

     I was notified by PayPal that I can't get my money back because the 
time for a dispute has lapsed. Pretty smart of Dawn to make the date of 
delivery after the date when I could get my money back. IMHO PLF VW is 
a bad deal for anyone who is considering buying from them YMMV but my 
experience has been a bad one. 345.00 down the drain. Sorry for the 
rant. But I'm pretty disappointed, since my only recourse is to 
&quot;contact the seller&quot; and dawn won't answer my e-mails and her # is 
disconnected.
