Subject: Rust on the installment plan

My '76 has a lot of surface rust. Since the discreet charm of the 
bourgeoise does not permit me to do body work in my garage bay, I'm going 
to have to let someone else have all the fun. And that means $$.

So I'm thinking of doing it on the installment plan, panel by panel. I 
all goes well, by the end of a year or so, I would have a rust-free bus. 
So the questions:

1) Should I buy the paint and hang on to it -- maybe divide it into quart 
cans -- to assure a color match?

2) Has anyone gone this route? Are there pitfalls?

3) How best to achieve some kind of economy. Panel by panel? Or should I 
try to get a couple panels done at a time.

Wish I could do it myself.  :-(&gt;
