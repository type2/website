&gt;      One of the items that really caught my eye was the plastic/poly-pro

&gt; our bus gas tanks.  What are your thoughts on adapting one of these tanks to
&gt; fit in the same location as the original tank in the bus?

Not a bad idea.  Of course there may be issues of the filler and vents,
but nothing insurmountable.

Another approach is to have a metal tank custom-made Pricey, but you can
get everything where you want it.  You might even get a wire welder and
practice your sheet metal skills on the tank!

Some have made tanks from fiberglass.  You basically make a plug from
styrofoam and then glass the outside of the plug.  You then cut the plug
out and seal up the big hole you used to remove the plug.  This approach
is popular with aircraft homebuilders.

It would be really cool if Karma provided a poly tank that fit the hole
perfectly!
