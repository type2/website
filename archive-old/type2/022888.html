Hello All,

Just got back from a 5 week trip driving through Arkansas, Southern 
Missouri, Southern Illinois, Southern Indiana, Southern Ohio, across 
West Virginia, up through Western Pennsylvania, and then looping back 
along similar, but different, 2 lane roads for the return route.

5,000 miles and wonderful Fall leaves to look at, as well as just 
PERFECT crisp camping along the whole route. It was on an equal with my 
14 week trip of last year doing Western USA and mountainous regions.

I found Southern Ohio to be a wonderful surprise as I drove from the 
very Northern tip of West Virginia to Cincinnati.
And yes, I did a gut fill of Gold Star chili, their midget length 
coneys, and cinnamon enhanced taste bud damage. :-)

I was amazed at all of the small town local Fall celebrations that seem 
to be taking place this time of year, and Mary Beth and I plan to be in 
the leaf color changing part of the country next Fall at around this 
same time frame (Oct 1 thru Oct 31).

All of Southern Ohio, as well as Southern Indiana off of old highway 50 
over to the Brownstown , Indiana area is just a pure Fall delight!
During the Fall, if camped out in this geographic area, people can take 
short day trips to see the seasonal scenery, stop in at local orchards 
for apple cider over-consumption, apple dumpling restaurant stops, etc. 
:-)

We found state parks to be virtually empty, and unattended for revenue 
collection.

Spring is nice just about everywhere in the World, but Fall in this 
part of the World is a sight to behold, and should be promoted as a 
definite travel schedule plan.

The two lane roads across Western Pennsylvania, Southern Ohio, and 
Souther Indiana was a confirmation of what i already knew ............ 
Beautiful !

Mary Beth turns in her resignation after January 1 of next year and 
will officially join me in being a &quot;road bum&quot;.
Casper is out there twitching to become our home !

This last trip of an average 23 MPG fuel consumption and his continued 
running with no problems at all was surely his promise to us of being 
our main cruise to pleasure.

Next year, Mary Beth and I are going to leave Houston around early to 
mid March, and be on the road until late November, travelling through 
as much as we enjoy for North America. We expect to not be able to 
enjoy as much as we want, so we will probably do the same thing in 2002.

After that, we will ship Casper to Europe and do multiple trips on that 
continent.
Casper's last great trip will be to India or deep Russia. We'll see.

North America ----------- 2001
North America ----------- 2002
The World ----------------- 2003 and afterwards.
