Subject: new Bosch starter closeout

Just a note that I have obtained a shipment of NEW, not rebuilt, Bosch SR87X
starters (with solenoid).  These fit 76-81 bus/vgn with manual trans. New
ones have not been available in quite some time, and rebuilt ones usually
sell for about $140 plus a $40 core deposit (so you have to ship your old
one back).

While they last, they are $99.95, brand new, with no core deposit. They are
already on the website (still using the SR87X part number), or of course you
can order by part number toll-free at 1-888-819-DEPOT.
