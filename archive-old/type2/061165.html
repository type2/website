&gt; Howdy-Hi Volks. Just bought an '80 Vanagon after having to tow it home
&gt; (no gear shifting) bled clutch with good results with all gears but 4th,
&gt; only grinding there. Tried to adjust shift rod per Bentley, now will not
&gt; shift out of what I belive to be 3rd.Question,finally, does this sound
&gt; like an adjustment prob or possibly something deeper in the trans like
&gt; selector shaft wear?

I think you may be too late about winter- yesterday we had 65 degrees,
today 30's with similar forecast all week. Seems like whatever we get in
Iowa, you get in Michigan 12-24 hours later, so today might be your last
day of fall!
I had a similar experience with my 82 vanagon, had to take off the shift
housing and use a prybar to get it out of 3rd. The trans was totally out
of oil. Put shift housing back on, put oil in, worked the shift lever
back and forth, it still works 2 years later. However, these are also
the symptoms of the dreaded 3rd-4th synchro hub self destruct syndrome, 
but I think that happens with 150,000 plus miles and more often 2.1
liter Vanagons (maybe more stress), though the parts involved are the
same as on the early Vanagons. For more info look at
