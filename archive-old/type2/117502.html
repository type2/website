Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot's Service, long complaint

On Sat, 23 Aug 2003, The Bus Depot wrote:

&gt; &gt; Well I just got a good serving of poor to bad service
&gt; &gt; from Ron's business, Ordered a few parts from Bus
&gt; 
&gt; As I have said many times before before, I encourage anyone to email me
&gt; personally if they have any issue with the Bus Depot that is not
&gt; promptly and satisfactorily resolved through our normal customer
&gt; service. How many retailers do you deal with where you have the
&gt; president of the company's personal email address and his encouragement
&gt; to use it if needed?  

here we go again, Ron gets beaten up on more than GEX, why is that, maybe
because he is avaliable and he traditionally provides the better service
he is held to a higher standard????

  I don't know but I get tired of seeing the petty stuff getting plastered
all over the place,  GEX stiffed me for 1,600+ they have reason to get
beat up on, Ron is in a business where there are a bunch of &quot;Cheap&quot; folks
trying to keep a ten year car running for 50 years....and complain when a
part is wrong, heck what is right with these things,  sometimes I think
the only thing original in mine is the steering wheel...

  I have been driving buses for over 35 years I even bought my 71 new from
the dealer,  and I know what a great resource we have in Ron (and one or
two others) and this list...  try keeping your van running when the only
choice you have is the dealer, and JCWhitney!!!  and no one to explain the
Bentley manual, which runs a close second to computer software
manuals...the only people who can understand them is the folks that
already know what they say...

  the mistakes I've made over the years that I wouldn't have if there were
this list or a parts supplier that has a clue like Ron...I could probably
have saved enough to pay the metal wiz or the Doc to get all the rust out
of my bus....

OK sorry had to get that off my chest,  now back to trying to keep theses
priceless pieces of junque running  ;8*}
