Subject: Sliding door page - hold the presses! Correction!

Sorry, folks :-(  I was reading the page for typos (all mine :), and
realized that I had left a step out!  Once you have removed the RS from
the door, to get it out of the track, you need to slide it back along the
track to a certain gap at the top of the track!  That gap is where the top
of the plastic block lifts up off the track.  After the plastic block is
off, then wriggling the wheel off the track is possible. If you don't
lift the block thru that gap, you will break the (AFAIK) NLA block!  I
have done this often enough that I *should* have remembered, but somehow I
just had a &quot;neuron misfire. 

I have posted two pictures of this gap at:

They are big, and will be shrunk for the final page.  Sorry :-(
