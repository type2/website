Wow, and she let you keep the Bus??? I say keep her fersur and take her on
another honeymoon, if you haven't already. Do it some more in the luvBus.

And, if you love your Bus, use a stock distributor at stock setting. Any
adjustment should be to mixture only. If you'er at 10K elevation on a
particularly low pressure day, you might exceed adjustability of the stock
system. Someone with more experience at high altitude adjustment will have
to chime in. You would need an exhaust gas measurement to check it, unless
you have an oxy sensor, in which case you can use a digital multimeter if
it is accurate from 0.2 to 0.8 volts.

I stongly suspect that the extra 5° aided in the resulting crunched crank,
and on your honeymoon, no less.
