Subject: Re:Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas 

Chris,
    In 1980 I worked for KLM Airlines at the airport in Amsterdam, Holland.
They had a number of baywindow buses with upright engines that we mechanics
could use to haul parts, tools, whatever, around the airport.  A couple of
them had hot water heat.
   There was a special tailpipe that ran through a &quot;can&quot; of about 8 inch
diameter.  Protruding from the side of the can were 2 nipples, each with a
rubber hose attached.  These hoses disappeared up into the engine
compartment.  I was told that in the can the tailpipe was wrapped with
copper tubing and that's what the nipple was that stuck out through the
side.  In the cab there was a heater box. It contained a heater core and a
fan with 2 or 3 speeds.
   Anti-freeze was circulated through the copper tubing and heated by the
tailpipe.  I hate to say it but I can't remember what was in between the
tailpipe and the heater box.
    So to answer your question, yes it can be done.  But like I tell my
sons, you can do ANYTHING if you are willing to spend enough time and money
on it.
