Volks,
   I know we have talked about this before, but I would like for you to
reply to me as I am in the market for new tires for my '79 bus. I am looking
the best brand to buy. I am looking at 195/75 R14, Lt truck tire with a &quot;D&quot;
rating and  can handle at least up to 50 psi. I would like feedback on what
you feel is the best manufacture and any pro and cons. Any information will
be greatly appreciated.

Brad
