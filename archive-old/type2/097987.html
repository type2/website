Subject: Re: [T2] Four Questions regarding:  how do I reconnect vacuum
  hoses?

(forwarded back to the list, I'll post the results too)

okay, this is what i'm going to try...


&gt; &gt;Four Questions:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1)  There is a single outlet (inlet?) at the back of the &quot;Emission 2
&gt; &gt;Way Valve&quot; mention directly above.  To what should that be
&gt; &gt;connected?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't remember the answer to that one.  I removed my smog equipment
&gt; over ten years ago.

if air is blowing out of it, I'm going to connect it to one of the two
inlets on the underside of the right air cleaner arm.

if air is being sucked into it, I'm going hook it up the the mystery
hose in question #4

&gt; &gt;1b) Can this &quot;Emission 2 Way Valve&quot; be completely removed and the
&gt; &gt;both
&gt; &gt;&quot;EGR Valves On Manifolds&quot; be plugged?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I blocked off the egr ports on the manifolds when I did this. 
&gt; Believe it or not, I made the blockoff plates out of scraps of wood
&gt; (I was living in an apartment at the time) and, with a homemade
&gt; gasket underneath they lasted until I removed the carbs (about 8
&gt; years).
&gt; 

I might do this as a last resort, i feel better now knowing that
somebody else did it without ill effects.


&gt; &gt;2)  There is a single outlet (inlet?) atop the Thermostatic valve
&gt; &gt;(which is afixed to the right side of air box).  To what should that
&gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt;connected?
&gt; 
&gt; Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think that goes to one of the
&gt; outlets listed below in #3.
&gt; 

yes, i found a recent post not yet in the archive archives) from
someone named Benoit, and the folks responding to his post said the
same thing.  sounds like a consensus!

&gt; &gt;3)  There are two outlets (inlets?) on the underside of the airbox
&gt; &gt;arm
&gt; &gt;that feeds the right carb.  One is brass, the other is plastic...
&gt; &gt;what
&gt; &gt;should be connected to these two outlets/inlets?
&gt; 
&gt; I think one goes to #2 above and the other goes to a vacuum source. 
&gt; Which vacuum source I couldn't tell you but it ought to be in a book
&gt; somewhere.

yes... see #1 and #2

&gt; &gt;4)  Underneath the vehicle, above the rear left axle, there is a Y
&gt; &gt;fitting spliced into the line leading to my brake servo.  Attached
&gt; to
&gt; &gt;that &quot;Y&quot; is a 3.5 mm ID hose left hanging loose and plugged.
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like a non-stock item.  I've never seen such a thing on a bus.
&gt; 

yeah, except the branch and dangling hose is mentioned by at least two
other people in the archives... and nobody seems to know what it is.

there is a picture of it in the Bentley manual... Section 7, page 18,
figure 9-2, item #11 (do i sound like a lawyer?).  the fat hose is
listed as going to the brake servo, but the skinny hose at the &quot;Y&quot;
isn't labeled.

now.. in the bentley manual, section 3, page 27, figure 7.3, item #8
says &quot;to brake servo.&quot;  item #5 is labled as simply &quot;solenoid operated
vacuum valve.&quot;  on page 51 (fig 2.9) of Haynes, a similar diagram
lables it as a &quot;two way valve,&quot; again leading to the brake servo...

so maybe if i hook up question #4's mystery hose to question #1's
valve, I'll kill two birds with one stone?

i just wish Haynes, Bentley, and others would call the parts by the
same name, then I could proceed with certainty...  :-/
