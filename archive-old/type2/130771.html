Subject: Thanks for all the help!

Greetings, all!

We are about to leave on a six-week trip from central Wisconsin to 
Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas. We'll be driving our 76 High Top 
Westy Guactoo and our 94 Taurus wagon. If you see a sage green mid-70s 
high top with a bunch of bumper stickers on the high top, that's us.

We have recently completed some major work on the bus, and it's running 
probably the best it ever has, even though it was converted from FI to 
a Weber prog carb by a PO.

A list of improvements, all of them done by me, who is definitely not a 
mechanic:

1) Pulled engine due to low compression in cyl 1, only to discover the 
spark plug hole threads needed to be chased. Reinstalled engine.
2) New push-rod seals.
3) New ignition system: Mallory VIA.
4) New battery-charging relay.
5) Repainting of body (done with tractor-type paint and sprayer 
w/compressor)
6) New speedometer cable.
7) New rear window seal.
8) A new side tent from Bus Depot
9) Proper tuning of carb thanks to good instructions at Redline.

I couldn't have done this stuff without the support of list members and 
the excellent vendors like Bus Depot and Aircooled_dot_net.

I'll be keeping a log, and posting it with pictures to a website upon 
my return.

Thanks again!
