check for worn bearings in the distributor shaft

Bob


&gt; Volks,
&gt; I am looking for the cause of a stumble on my 78 2.0L FI (all stock).
&gt; 
&gt; The particulars follow;
&gt; 3K on rebuilt by AVP
&gt; new wires, plugs, points (adjusted to 47 degrees dwell), cap, rotor.
&gt; Coil is not new
&gt; timing set to 7.5 before
&gt; adjusted valves to zero plus 1 full turn
&gt; 
&gt; I finally got around to adjusting the valves per AVP after running the
&gt; new motor for a while. I had a slight stumble before the valve
&gt; adjustment, but now I have a significant stumble. It is intermittent, at
&gt; all RPMs except idle, maybe a little worse under load. Distributor
&gt; advances to about 28-30 degrees at 2500RPM (timing jumps around a bit at
&gt; idle (6-9 degrees) and at 2500 (26-32 degrees)). I have an appt to put
&gt; it on an exhaust sniffer tomorrow morning to ensure I am within spec
&gt; there. It feels like a big misfire. Otherwise it idles smoother and when
&gt; not missing seems to run better then ever.
&gt; 
&gt; As usual, your help is greatly appreciated!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Chris
