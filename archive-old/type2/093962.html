Subject: Re: [T2] VW dealers: Dont get me started  RANT

[...]
from a survey i did for the place i work, it is entirely possible.  It 
just depends on brand, model, and which frequency trip it was.
i actually went to a couple of the unbelievably priced dealers and 
looked at the work done
on one vehicle (mid price range)
15000 mile checkup
air cleaner (one of the expensive ones that even the aftermarket runs 20 
bucks)
oil change (synthetic on this vehicle)
oil filter (reasonable)
computer diag checkout (49 to 79 bucks at most shops)
clean and refit the battery (wont find that at most shops)
inspect brakes
inspect Power steering
check all hoses and belts
(no plugs..this is done at the 50000 mile check &gt;bosch +4 from factory)
test charging system

total on this one was 125 bucks

non dealer would still have been about the same for all that stuff to be 
done.
a luxury vehicle on about the same checkout (mercedes) was 175. (and 
dino oil not synthetic)

&gt; $150 for an oil change and check up???
&gt; I spent $250 total in the first 50K miles on HONDA brand oil filters 
&gt; and synthetic oil in oil changes for my Honda. ($25 per oil change - my 
&gt; oil, my filter, my labor every 5K miles).
&gt; What did they do for you for $150????
&gt; Not trying to make you feel stupid - just trying to get the picture 
&gt; here. I have heard of alot of expensive dealer checks. I get 200K 
&gt; miles+ out of my cars and they never see a dealer. Just trying to 
&gt; understand the value....
