Subject: when clutch is in i hear noise, until its released ..what
  gives?

I've never replace a clutch in a VW, as a matter of
fact when i pulled my engine from my bus, that was my
first for VW as well..

I have replaced other clutchs, throw out bearings, etc
on other cars.. and im assuming this noise im hearing
is probably the throwout bearing.. is this the round
little lever that is attached to the tranny?

or is this noise im hearing when the cluch is pushed
in the pressure plate? 

The noise isnt to bad, but noticable to me.. How long
would one guess i have before i have to replace it.??

thanx,
rob
