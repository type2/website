Subject: Re: [VB] Why dwell would vary with RPM?

I believe it's normal due to point float.  Dwell is the amount of time 
the points are closed.  So at higher rpms the points float a bit and 
lower the dwell.  Setting the points to minimum of the dwell range, and 
measuring under the max dwell at a higher rpm is all you can do with 
points.  You might make sure that you are using quality points that have 
a good return spring on them - besides all of the maintenance stuff like 
lubrication to prevent binding on the post, etc.  I don't have bus 
specs, but Vanagon specs are 44-50 - so you still sound good.
