Subject: My bus is now water-cooled.

...But from the inside of the combustion chamber, rather than from  
the outside.

This afternoon I installed a water injection system as described by  
Robt Mann and Phil Cain. I am using a 4L water tank installed below  
the battery tray, and a 25-gauge needle tapped into the vacuum line  
to the distributor. It draws no water at idle, but water does start  
to flow as soon as the throttle is engaged.

It's rush hour right now, so I haven't had opportunity to take it out  
on the highway and see how it does. That will come later tonight and  
tomorrow. After I get home from a weekend away with the camper on  
Sunday I will post some pics of the setup, along with a review of its  
operation. I did take it for a spin to the corner gas station so I  
could get a baseline on fuel consumption, and it felt pretty peppy at  
speeds from 0-45MPH. But that was just a short jaunt.

Installing the water tank was a PITA. At the moment it is also a PITA  
to fill it. I have a plan to reroute the filing hose to a more  
convenient location, hopefully this will get done next week.  
Installing the actual needle and water lines was no big deal. I only  
had to drill one hole in the bus, which was 3/4&quot; in diameter to allow  
the filler hose to pass through the battery tray. The water injection  
hose is inside the filler hose as it crosses through the battery  
tray, and there's an air stone acting as a filter at the end of the  
water line inside the tank.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
