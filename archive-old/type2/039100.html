Andy:
    Thanks for the response. The brakes worked quite well before the rear
cylinder blew. the MC was replaced with a NOS one a couple of years ago. I
would think it was stil fine. I replaced all of the hoses about one year ago
when I did a front/rear brake job. The brakes have been flushed a few times
since then, so I would assume that the lines were pretty clean. One more
thing: in all the times that I have removed the rear drums I have never had
trouble getting them off until this work was done. The shoes seemed to be
pressing against the drums and holding them on. The adjuster stars were
screwed in as far as they could go.
Baffled,
Jeff

&gt; did you have problems with the brakes heating before they did the work?
&gt; Did they replace therear hoses?
&gt; Actually My first thought would be that the MC isnt relieving the pressure
&gt; to the rears I would first check the pedal  free play adjustment and
&gt; secondly I might consider it a MC problem with that valve  or possibly a
&gt; dirt blockage there.
&gt; As far as the backing plates.. hmmm the actual hardwars mounts through the
&gt; backing plate but flush to the housing. The brake shoes do sit directkly
&gt; on it though. I really dont know what differences there could be. Could
&gt; they be a different adjuster?
&gt;
&gt; good luck
