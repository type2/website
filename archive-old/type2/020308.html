Bricks, ice scrapers, even the heater control idea (cool one, Scott!)
are all just *throttle* controls, not true cruise controls, right?  I
mean, compare throttle setting going UP that long hill with the throttle
setting going DOWN the other side.  

What you need is a true *speed* control -- speed of engine or speed of
car would work.  Actually, you'd need one with the patented Clark
Anticipator: built-in radar that detects the road grade ahead and speeds
up if it's uphill.

Best cruise control I've ever had on a breadloaf bus was the foot up
position: sit way back, put left foot up on the round fresh air vent,
and right foot stays on the gas.  No fatigue. ;-)
