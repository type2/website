&gt; '78 Westy stock EFI. Solid lifters. I get 16-18mpg highway at 65-70mph. I would love to drive 55-60 but around Washington DC and Baltimore you will get either rear ended or run off the road going that slow. 65-70 is scary enough.

ain't that the truth, I have to go up too Delaware twice a month and
getting on I-95 can be a hair raising experience and crossing the
Susquehanna river bridge (very high and in gorge) can really get
interesting, I usually try to hit the bridge in the center lane with
no one beside me, not always possible but fortunately the state has
wind &quot;thingies'&quot; at the ends of the bridge so you can get an idea of
the wind speed and direction.
 hate when I have to stop for gas because they are in the median and
you have to merge into the fast lane when you come back onto the road.
no-one will let you in even when all you want is to get back to the
relative safety of the slow lane!!!!!  Drafting a truck is not an
option, more often they look like they are trying to draft you...

I-495 is not an option, the most I will drive on that is from the B-W
parkway to the New Carrollton Metro station!!! and usually it is
driven to the nearest MARC station and take the train in.
