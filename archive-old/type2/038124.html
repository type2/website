Volks,

Has anyone had any experiences with these folks. I am thinking of placing an
order for a bunch of stuff. Their line has been busy from 9am this morning
to 11:00PM EST. Either they are swamped, or someone left the phone off the
hook. I even went so far as to call their local operator. She said the
exchange was not busy.

Thanks,
Matt
