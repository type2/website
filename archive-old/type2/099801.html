&gt;I have been running much the same setup on my Westfakia. Back in April a local junkyard had a skidload of &quot;Johnson Controls&quot; sealed forklift/golf-cart batteries for sale, and for $20CDN I couldn't see not picking one up to use as an auxiliary power supply.

Excuse me while I wipe the drool off of my keyboard... for that price I would have bought the whole pallett!

&gt;Not quite as hands-free as running an isolator, but it works OK for me. I have an isolator, but haven't made time to install it as I'm not sure it would be safe with this kind of battery. Opinions?

No difference in the function of the isolater with that battery, so you're okay there.


&gt;FWIW, Another local bus-owner put one of these batteries in a 68 westy, and after a subsequent regulator problem it inflated like a balloon. So you can understand wanting to be careful with this.

Any battery is capable of causing serious harm if overcharged.  Don't let that scare you away from using this battery, but do keep an eye on your charging voltage.  A while back my regulator failed and my alternator was pumping 50 amps into my battery continuously.  Fortunately I have a VDO voltmeter mounted right in front of my face and I saw it pegged at over 15V.  I was able to pull over and repair the problem before it caused serious damage to my batteries and maybe even worse as a result.  I like gauges.
