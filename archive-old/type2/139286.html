Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust leak

Try bolting the muffler to the exchangers without gaskets and tighten 
everything up. Using a feeler gauge, work around the joint searching 
for openings. If you don't find them with the feeler gauge (and I 
suspect you will), then use a very fine needle.

Somewhere in there, the flanges aren't meeting. Are you torquing to 
specs?
