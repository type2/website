Subject: '81 CA eng into '80 non-CA

I may be putting a California '81 engine in my '80 non-CA Westi.
I have been studying Bently and have noticed that the CA has only one 
heat exchanger (R) with the catalytic converter replacing the HEX (L)
Does this mean that I will will have half the heating capacity and 
have to block off the left side ?
Are there any other differences that I need to know about?
