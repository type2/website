I heard too that the low quality Voltage Isolators burned out - so I bought a good
one, a Hella. It has been fine for 3 or 4 years. The original fuse (20A) blew regularly
but I replaced this with a 25A fuse and all is okay now.

I know it sounds like a small amperage but the theory is that when your 2nd battery is
flat and the first is okay, the difference in potential (voltage) causes a current flow
to recharge the second battery. Since the voltage difference will only be a few volts
at the most, no untoward events happen. You could look at the split charger as just
another accessory for the main battery/charging system.

Why are all the American ones such a high amperage?

If you connect 2 batteries in SERIES you'll get 24 volts at the same current flow.
Not good. If you connect in PARALLEL you will get 12 volts but double the current,
but you lose the whole point of having 2 batteries in the first place, namely you
can camp for a week, flatten the 2nd battery then still start the bus with the
fresh one. I believe some UK Toyota diesels had 2 batteries in parallel, to help
with the glow plugs/starting.

Isolators are not the best way to charge two batteries.  It worked great
for about a year, but I guess they burn out.  We push start my '69 from a
gas station with Isolator bypassed.

hum.....what way IS the best way then , i was searching for a isolater today
and all but one rv shop knew what i was talking baout and thery only have the
70 amp ones, and i think mine is only 50 amps, (72) am i right about this?

and can i connect 2 batterys in series? will that work, and how effictive is
it?
