Subject: Rudiments of art/scales

Sorry to cause pain with my wrongness.  I tend to agree with those who disagree
with my  recent statements.  I sort of still feel that there should be a
seamless incorporation of rudiments in the work of the master.  I understand
that Mozart (and others) at some point had to learn and pratice scales, and
everyone has to warm up (whether for minutes or weeks or days); but wouldn'tt
such a person eventually own these things and go on to spend time in more
expressive exercises?  

I guess what I am experiencing here is the contradictions inherent in drawing
analogies between the disciplines.  I spent years (even wrote an unpublished
book) trying to draw analogies between colour and music. There is just so far
one can go down this path before falling into a kind of obsessive mania.
