Subject: Stolen Bus

Hi,

In an earlier post, I made reference to the fact that my bus was stolen this
weekend.  Here are the details:  1972 ASI Blue VW Campmobile Type 4 engine
VIN: 2322137800, old Oregon plates KJJ 426.  Taken from my driveway in
Milwaukie, Oregon Sunday morning March 28th between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m..
It had a
large bass cabinet in it, Peavey Model 3620 with two 18 and two 10
speakers, serial no.#9889000.  Should anyone see it or hear of its
whereabouts, please call 911 to contact the Clackamas County Sheriffs
office or 503.655.8218.  Thanks for any and all help.  I will send photos to
individual inquiries.

Thanks again 

Kurt Selvig
