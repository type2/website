Over time many folks adjust the cables and not the shoe clearance. This can
throw it all out of whack.  You may also have a fraying cable, leaking
fluid, frozen lever at the shoes, etc.  All else in order, you may need to
de-adjust your cables at the equalizing bar first, then lift the rear wheels
and adjust the stars equally to the point of just locking the drum.  Back
off equally just till they turn freely, centering the shoes by giving the
pedal a few taps in the process. Scraping = ok/binding = NONO. Now go
equally adjust the HB cables to the point where they don't increase any lock
on the drums. When you think you've got it, check the rears for equal drag
after you advance the HB lever a few clicks. The equalizer bar should give
the same pull to both cables if everything is within spec. You can get a
very high pedal and short throw on the handbrake this way.  If you remove
the drums, anti-seize the HB pivot, adjuster threads &amp; barrel.

And that's a 46 mm nut on the rear axles fellas, since '68 I believe ;-)

Don't know what's causing one brake not to work but you don't need a 36mm
wrench.  Just remove the 2 smaller bolts on the outer side of the drum.  The
drum will come right off the hub.  You may have to loosen the brakes with
the adjusting stars as a &quot;lip&quot; sometimes builds up on the inside edge of the
drum from the shoe wear.  You only need the 36mm nut removed to work on the
bearings (I know because I made the same assumption once)
Just thought I'd save you the trouble.

&gt;I'm still looking for a 36mm socket to get a look at the brakes on the side
&gt;where they are failing, but wondered if anyone else has run into this same
&gt;problem. Parts needed? Workaround? Thanks in advance.
