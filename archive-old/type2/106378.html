&gt;Subject: [T2] Yellow manual vs. CD

&gt;I finally got a look at the &quot;Yellow&quot; book, the Type 2 factory repair
manual
&gt;from VW. The content of the 2nd ed. is exactly the same as the $100 CD
that
&gt;Bentley sells except the manuals go up to 1978 and the CD includes info
on
&gt;1979 models.



Why don't you make a disk image or a bin and cue of that CD so people
could download it? I know a lot of people out there would love to have
it available for their laptops they now travel with and it might be
easier to see if people have a larger monitor over the book which has a
set font size. I know I have used a magnifying glass once or twice to
read the directions carefully. Plus there is the grease and oil
factor... a cd goes into a small case and hopefully you like your pc as
much as your veedub that you will clean your hands or have someone else
insert and operate the pc.
