Subject: Starting Problem (Alternator?)
Message-ID: &lt;37746100.3D3A4C47_at_usa_dot_net&gt;

Many thanks for the help I received with my hot start problem. The
wiring is fixed, and I received the now ignition switch and relay in the
mail yesterday. However, before I could install it, the bus decided to
throw another problem at me. I tried to start the car, the started
began, then stopped ... the headlights dimmed... and there was an eerie
silence.

So, I push started the car, and it did start, but just after I pulled
out of the parking space, the car stopped again. Well, I gave it one
more try with the push starting (my arms were getting pretty tired) to
no avail. Someone saw me in my troubles and offered to push my car with
theirs to get it started. So we did that, and I limped home sandwiched
between two cars with their emergency lights on using hand signals (the
headlights wouldn't turn on, nor the blinkers). 

I took the battery to the AutoZone today, got it recharged. The guy said
it &quot;checked out ok&quot;, and I popped it in the car. She started, but the
interior light kept brightening and then dimming with each revolution of
the engine. I got out and went around to the back and heard a ticking
noise that I had never heard before (possibly not connected with this)
coming from the engine. I backed it into the garage to keep it out of
the drenching Houston rain, and to get a better look at it. Everything
looks fine on the surface, but she won't start again. I'm guessing its
the alternator, but is there something that I'm missing? Also, if it is
the alternator, should I just have the darn thing replaced?

		Thank you,
