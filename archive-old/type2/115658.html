&gt; Wonderful idea Richard, did you get your tape at a body shop supply store?
&gt; Is there a web site?

I had some left over from a motorcycle project. I bought black and red and
silver but didn't use the silver so I put it on the bus.  If you've ever
followed a vehicle down the road with this tape applied you know how hard it
is to ignore it. All the police cruisers seems to have the red/white strips
on their bumpers following the DOT requirements for large trucks.

The tape blends into the bumper during the day.

I had trouble finding it but I'm sure it's available locally. It's just not
well advertized and many sign shops I went to only had large sheets that
were expensive not the small rolls I needed.

Goto &lt;www.galls_dot_com&gt; and enter 3M into their search field.

Then choose silver/reflective for the color combination.

It comes in 60&quot; and 150ft rolls. IIRC, the bus bumper is 82&quot; long so I just
centered the roll.

&gt; Thanks, I really like this idea and want to put some on the bumper of my
&gt; Scamp that I pull behind my '76 westy.

Good idea if I don't say so myself. ;-)
