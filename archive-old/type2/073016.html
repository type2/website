&gt;The idea of creating a database of list members' addresses and phone
&gt;numbers is a really BAD idea, and one to which I will object vociferously.
&gt;Everyone on the list please be advised you do not have my permission to put
&gt;my name in any such database.

Down, boy! =^ ) I repeat that it would be opt-in, you would have to
personally place your information in the DB.
