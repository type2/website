Subject: Re: [T2] rebuild wont start! any ideas?

Sounds like a bad ignition switch or a short in one of the FI sensor
devices.. cylinder head temp sender, thermo time sensor.

&gt; i've been getting great advice on the list as i've rebuilt my 4th van 
&gt; (along with many other things here and there through the years)... 
&gt; and now i have another question on my latest...
&gt; 
&gt; did a full rebuild on Lucy, my latest 75 1.8 camper, and just 
&gt; finished getting everything together this morning... hooked 
&gt; everything up and turned it over and she caught for a fraction of a 
&gt; second and died... kept doing this, and on about the fourth time 
&gt; there was a puff of fuel-air and a little bit of flame out one of 
&gt; the intake hoses (the hoses that seal the connection between the 
&gt; intake air distributor and the intake headers - the two deals on 
&gt; either side that the injectors are attached to)... anyway, it only 
&gt; happened on the left side...
&gt; 
&gt; so i have rebuilt heads from a shop here in seattle (northwest 
&gt; connecting rods)... i noticed that they pink their valve seats in, 
&gt; if that makes a difference here... the reason i mention valves is 
&gt; because as i've thought this problem through this evening on my way 
&gt; up to the san juans in Molly, my backup 76 celica that i bought for 
&gt; two hundred bucks when i tore the van engine apart and who has run 
&gt; perfectly fine for five months even though she backfires, diesels, 
&gt; and can't maintain an idle in the cold (you should see the nightmare 
&gt; that the last mechanic to work on her made of the carb linkages and 
&gt; lines - yet there's nothing quite like the 20R enging) - i've been 
&gt; thinking that the only reason you might get pressure back into the 
&gt; intake headers is if the intake valves are not sealing all the way 
&gt; when the piston is on the upswing, so i must be getting some blowby 
&gt; into the intake system... but i did set the valves, and i'm fairly 
&gt; certain i did it correctly (i say fairly only beca!
&gt; use i am always second guessing myself)...
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, if anyone might have an idea of what might be wrong 
&gt; (incidentally, though i continued trying to start her she didn't 
&gt; flame out the headers again but she still pushes fuel air out cause 
&gt; there is a bit of moisture coming out those hoses) i'd love to hear 
&gt; some advice... a couple other things that might help the diagnosis: 
&gt; i put a clamp on the boot (that's probably a better word to use than 
&gt; hose) where it had pushed out before and that stopped it on that 
&gt; side, but only that side... i could conceivably clamp all 8 points 
&gt; on those boots (leading to both heads that is) but the more i think 
&gt; about it the more i'm worried about the fact that pressure is coming 
&gt; up from the heads... one thing to note on the side that it is 
&gt; pushing out the two tubes on the header are slightly cocked to the 
&gt; ports on the air ditributor so the boots aren't quite straight, thus 
&gt; might not make a terrific seal... also, with further attempts at 
&gt; starting she would start and run for a half second (but lon!
&gt; ger than at first) and then cough to a stop... usually it was when 
&gt; she coughed to a stop that i'd hear air being forced out of those 
&gt; boots... oh yeah and my timing might not be right on (4 atdc that 
&gt; is) as i didn't mark the distributor position adequately (though 
&gt; it's a rebuild with a new cam anyway) - but i did line it up with 
&gt; the post for plug 1 with the crank at timing... so i can't be far 
&gt; off
&gt; 
&gt; so the plan now is to doube check the valves, see about sealing 
&gt; those boots, and cross my fingers unless someone has a better 
&gt; idea... and any help would be appreciated!
&gt; 
&gt; worry for writing a book here but i have this tendency to write like 
&gt; a talk and my third grade teacher always did say i had a problem 
&gt; with talking too much :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; thanks!
