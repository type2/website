Subject: axle beam removal - brake servo

Hi, I'm in the middle of removing the rusted beam from my 71, and just 
need some clarification on the procedure for clearing the mc and servo 
out of the way.  I've read and re-read the article in the library, 
(thanks Steve), and the bentley shows a pre 71 beam being removed, so 
I'm a little confused as to what to do next.  I  don't want to create 
more work for myself, as the brakes had been working great, and I'm not 
planning on replacing anything but rubber lines.  I'm also working in 
an incredibly cramped garage, with about 1.5 feet on each side

Everything else has gone smoothly so far, thanks to the archives, 
library, and penetrating oil, but I'm sure there will be more Q's 
coming soon :)

TIA
Don J
