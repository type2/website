Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic vs. solid lifters

Kevin,
  I have a '78 Westy with hydro lifters, and it seemed like they never 
worked right.  My adjustment screw faces were always chewed up, and I burned 
exhaust valves like mad.  What's worse, I never felt confident that I was 
adjusting them correctly.  They clattered all the time, even though I 
followed all of the correct procedures for installation.  It turns out I've 
got a cam in there (from the previous owner, I guess) that has non-stock 
lift (.330 at the cam, if I remember correctly).  So now my engine is out of 
the bus and waiting for time to rebuild it.  The hydraulics were so 
confusing that I have a bad taste in my mouth about them now, and I'm 
switching to solids.  I am going to buy some of the FAT Performance 8mm 
rocker arm studs and their bolt on valve covers to make the hardest part of 
valve adjustment easier, which is removal of that damn wire and cover with 
the heat exchangers on.  I like to adjust valves though.  I just want to 
know what's going on in my engine for a change.

Good luck!
Brian Zweerink

&gt;But, I've only known solids, and am hesitant to go with the hydraulic type.
&gt;      #1: Need I be concerned, or will all be ok?
