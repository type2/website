&gt; If you haven't visited Richard Atwell's website, or haven't done so for
&gt; a while, be sure to do so and bookmark it. Richard's is the Oxford
&gt; English Dictionary, the Smithsonian Institution, the Harrah's of bus
&gt; websites. If we had to pay for it, we couldn't afford it.
&gt;
&gt; I think there may have to be, at some point, an official Richard Atwell
&gt; day.


I suggest Richard Atwell website fans consider sending a donation to
http://www.type2_dot_com/donate.html.  When I get needed help from the list I
try and do this and I've certainly benefited from Richard's site.
