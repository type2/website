Hello Listees,

In getting my old bus ready for BNNTA (BBTA), I decided it was time to 
replace the throwout bearing as it has been making some noise lately.  I also 
thought it would be good to replace the clutch disc and pressure plate at the 
same time.  Well, after replacing those items, and yes, I have the correct 
Sachs pressure plate (diaphragm with collar), clutch disc and throwout 
bearing for a '69.

Well after getting it all put back together I find that I now have a slight 
vibration at about 2500 rpm that wasn't there before.  The pilot shaft 
bearing is in good shape and was new 10K miles ago.  The clutch replacement 
was an iterative process to get the right parts and I did drive the bus with 
a different pressure plate but the same disc and T/O bearing, so I'm thinking 
that the problem is with the pressure plate.

Right now I'm planning to adjust the clutch a bit looser just in case there 
is too much tension although I doubt it since I have the requisite free pedal 
play.  If that doesn't do the trick I am thinking about rotating the pressure 
plate either 120 or 180 degrees to see if that helps things come into balance.

I've never had this problem before and I would be interested to hear what 
experiences others have had, also any other suggestions that I might try.

Many thanks,

Rob Dahlgren
