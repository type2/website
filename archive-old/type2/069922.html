BUT, you filled in a blank for me.  The S-Code of UO confirms
that O is for Oleans (as in New).  The first code is U for USA
(country) and the second code is for port.  We code freaks are
still trying to decipher all of those.

is this stuff going on the NEATO page?  that would be great!!! 
did you catch that UX was delivered to Seattle?

and craig says of his bus with tag

&gt; 06  4
&gt; 423 002  043  071 620  621
&gt; UO 2612 131383  5148182

&gt; VWAG tells me that my bus was built may 5, 65; shipped to New
&gt; Orleans May 11, 65. Whoops. *Someone* is off here. The tag would.....

according to my vw numbers, 

last bus in april 65   - 215 146 424
last bus in may 65   - 215 161 145

craigs bus is    -           *265148182*

so these numbers do suggest an early may date,   not april 6 as the tag says.
 

just adding my two cents again,  who'll win this pot, or who's gonna ante it
up?
