Subject: Re: [T2] ISO late model head stud filler


&gt;These bolts should be available at any good hardware store (i.e. Ace, True 
&gt;Value, NOT Home Depot/Lowes).

Lowes had stainless steel metric bolts, nuts, and washers the last time I 
went in there.

Locally it is the Ace Hardware that doesn't have much of a bolt selection.

Our best local suppliers are Lowes, Maddux Hardware (True Value Mom&amp;Pop), 
and Highland Hardware (another Mom&amp;Pop). We also have a place called what 
else but &quot;Nuts and Bolts&quot;. They have anything you can imagine but sometimes 
the quantity is a bit large for my needs.

Luckily my Father sells all sorts of hardware in industrial quantities...

If you need hardware or electrical supplies in quantity be sure to use the 
phone book and look for industrial suppliers. Sometimes you can get a 
hundred pieces for cheaper than 12 at the local hardware store.
