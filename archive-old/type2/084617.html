Subject: Helpful Hint - Blocking type4 heater ducts

My bus leaks a little oil.  Right onto the heat exchangers.  This makes the 
heat smell bad, so I have stopped using the heat.  No problem usually, but 
lately I have been getting some fumes coming from the heater vents even 
when the heat is completely off.  I thought one of the flapper boxes might 
not be completely closed, so I removed both of the accordian tubes just to 
be sure none of that smelly air would make it into the cab.  This didn't 
work either - there was still a small amount of fumes coming up through the 
defroster vents.  I guess the cab is lower pressure than under the bus.

I decided to cap the metal heater ducts where they would connect to the 
front of the accordian tubes.  I went to Home Depot and got some 2&quot; 
diameter black rubber caps with integrated hose clamps (available in 
various diameters) for $3 each.  They are made for temporarily capping 
sewer and other PVC type pipes.  The caps fit perfectly and no more bad 
heater smell.  I won't need the heat again for at least six months and 
hopefully by that time I will have attended to the oil leaks.
