&gt; I need a cargo door lock for my 1970 single cab right side cargo door. Any
&gt; leads on where to find one would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Martin,

I live in the Netherlands. A Friend of me parted out a 1974 single cab
last year. I have no idea weather this lock will fit on a 1970 model. I
spotted the rusty cargo door with the lock in it at his house recently.
I could inform to ask what it costs. But then you also have to pay
shipping so it might be cheaper to find one at your place.

Vincent
