Hi there,

I've got a 75 westy

I recently noticed my passenger side rear turn signal behaving strangely. 
The running light would sometimes go out randomly and when i apply my 
right turn signal the flasher indicator on the dash blinked very quickly  
and upon walking to the rear of the vehicl i noticed that the license 
plate light and the passenger side indicator were blinking quickly as well.

I took action.  Muir said to check the fuses. The fuses all seemed ok so i 
pulled out the flasher a metal one with 3 male plugs. I then pulled out a 
black plastic box next to the flasher with about 5 male plugs. After I re 
inserted it the turn signals would not blink at all the lights (headlights 
included dimmed.) and things generally went south from there. At some 
point before the flasher change the radio quit. Anyway it stalled right 
after the lights dimmed and would not start back up.

Any direction based on the collective experience of the list will be 
greatly appreciated. I'm planning a big road trip in 10 days so I'll need 
to get this figured out pretty soon.

Thanks in advance for all of the help.

Mick
