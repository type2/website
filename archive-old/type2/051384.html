Subject: Re: [T2] hot wheel solved

Not only should you replace both at the front, but also the two at the
rear!!  Brake lines should be new every 10 years or so.

Bus Depot or RMMW will have them.  You can save a couple bucks at Bus
Depot, but RMMW will have them to your door in a couple days.


&gt;Posted a couple days ago about one rear wheel getting hot after running, and
&gt;a few people told me to check the brake lines. I thought that was silly,
&gt;until I realized that the brake fluid gets shoved into the wheel cylinder,
&gt;but then can't get back out when you have a arterial sclorosis in your
&gt;flexible lines. I.E. you have a locked brake. Which is exactly what I had.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the fine advice.
&gt;
&gt;One more question: If the bus pulls to one side when I apply the brakes, and
&gt;the diagnosis is a restricted flexible brake hose, should I put the new hose
&gt;on the side to which the bus pulls, or the other side? (Don't tell me I
&gt;should replace both -- I already know that but the store didn't have two.)
