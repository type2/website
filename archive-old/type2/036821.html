NGK's are definitely not superior to bosch at least in the marine world It is well
known that NGK's have a habit of the insulator splitting if the engine is flooded
i.e.; too much raw fuel hits the insulator. The plug then shorts threw the
insulator even though it looks perfectly good to the eye. I went threw countless
NGK's on my honda generator and outboard before switching to bosch which
eliminated the problem . My 74 Hanover gets nothing but Bosch
