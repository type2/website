&gt;Hello, all:
&gt;I've stumbled on a most frustrating problem.
&gt;My battery (78 westy) is new, as in bought three months ago from NAPA, but
&gt;persists in losing its charge after a week or so. I've pulled it and had it
&gt;tested *twice*, and it's checked out great both times. I also pulled the
&gt;alternator and had that tested, and it too has come up fine on a bench
&gt;test. So I replaced the regulator (grasping at straws after two months of
&gt;push starting and booster cables) with a brand new one.
&gt;Still, I'm drained.

Pull one of the battery cables and put an ammeter across it.  There has to
be current flowing across it or else you simply have a bad
battery/alternator.  Start removing fuses until the current goes away and
trace from there.  If you can get the bus into a garage (or somewhere dark)
crawl around it and look for a light on.  Just some thoughts, hope it helps.

-David
