Don't think so, the 5 holes are not equally distributed so there is only one way to bolt the cam gear on; besides if I were off by THAT much (360/5=72 degrees) it wouldn't have fired at all. Thanks for the suggestion,

From: Faster-Laster &lt;jason_at_fasterlaster_dot_com&gt;
&gt; just to double check. is it possible you have the cam bolted to the
&gt; cam gear incorrectly. Aren't there 5 bolts. If you perhaps got it off
&gt; on the initial bolt together, the dots on the gears would align up,
&gt; but the cam would still be off. Long shot I know, but worth a look
&gt; before reassembly.
