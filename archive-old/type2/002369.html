Volks,

I sent the following question to the list a couple of weeks ago and received one response which was not the problem.  So, I would like to pose this same question to you one last time.

On October 1, I wrote:

I encountered a problem that I have never seen before.  The culprit is a 78
stock FI bus.

I was helping a friend who is getting his Westy ready to take into the
paint shop and the bus has been sitting for about 2 years in his garage. 
When we got it running tonight, we noticed that the brake pedal would not
return on its own.  Upon further inspection, the pedal seemed very mushy
and it would feel mushy when you pushed on it or pulled it to its upright
position.  Then we shut the engine down and the pedal went back to normal,
very stiff and would return just fine.  Then we started the engine again,
and you could see the pedal engage under its own power and thus, I must
say, I have not seen this before.

Is there some sort of regulator to regulate the amount of vacuum the servo
gets?  Any ideas on what would cause this?

Thanks much,
Ed Woenker
