&quot;Stumbled on this via my eBay search bot.  Someone in California must get
this one -- it looks gorgeous!&quot;

Well...  I'm wondering what's up with the paint...  I suspect that since 
the paint looks funky in the front and under the front doors that it's 
been wrecked in the front and the respray wasn't terribly good.  And 
there's not closeups of the rockers...   The engine compartment looks 
pretty rough, and the rear cushion appears rather abused.

I guess I'm just gloating 'cuz mine is just like it but better, 'cept 
for the coupla small dings...
