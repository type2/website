Hello,

I hate to say this about the air cond. that I posted last week but here
goes, I was un screwing the amazingly long screws and maybe I should
have thought about gravity cuz all of a sudden the plastic venting that
goes between the seats cracked and fell with the back half and I thought 
in that state it would be useless so I unfortunately pitched it. I do
still have the motor part that goes in the back, If any one wants
it.(p-mail me)
