Subject: RE: [T2] Rear Tire Clearance

I have been running with only a 1/4 &quot; to 3/8 &quot; clearance for about 20 years
and 70,000 miles no problem here on my 72. not even a scuff mark from the
fender.
you can roll the inside fender lip upwards if you really would like more
clearance. I'm using 14x6&quot; wheels with 205/70/14, just about have them worn
down and planning on putting some 195/14 D rated tiers on the next time
around.

Subject: [T2] Rear Tire Clearance


I need some help about rear tire clearance. I have installed a 15x5.5 rim
with
a 195/65/15 tire and the rear tire clearance is about 1/4&quot; from the side
wall.
I am very concerned that this is just too close and risk  the side wall
being
cut by the outside wheel well.  The rear hight is stock so the tire sits in
the wheel well about 1 3/4&quot;. I have talked with other Bus owners and they
seem
to think this won't be a problem but I thought I would ask to get as much
input as possible.
