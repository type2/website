Hey Stevo, Merry Christmas.
Top of the season to the list as well.  It's great to have such a resource at
my fingertips.

    I just fixed the leak on my '76 and no water yet.  We live in Vancouver,
BC,  so i figure it's sealed with all the rain we get here on the &quot;Wet
Coast&quot;.  My fix was a simple tube of black silicone sealant, the kind of
sealant used on GM and Ford for gaskets.  I used a caulking gun and snipped
off the optional plastic nozzle that comes with the sealant tube at the
almost smallest opening possible. Then I manuvered the nozzle under the
windshield seal and started &quot;injecting&quot; the sealant all around the inside of
the seal.  The rubber seal is very rigid and popped the nozzle out so I had
to restart the nozzle a few times.  I started from the top center and worked
my way around to the bottom center and started again around the other side.
Then I performed the same procedure on the seal where it makes contact to the
body and went around.
    The hardest part was the clean-up...
    Once I had the silicone in both sides of the outer windshield seal, I
used my thumb to push on the seal to distribute the excess silicone around
and push out the excess as well.  Then I used disposable rags to wipe up the
mess.  You need  a fair amount of rag material as silicone can and will get
everywhere if you're not careful. Once that was completed, I used my finger
with a liberal amount of saliva, yes saliva, to make a nice even surface.
Saliva won't allow the silicone to stick to the fingers.  Ask any plumber who
has done this on the perimiter of a bathtub.
    This was two weeks ago and we're still dry.  I know that it's probably
frowned upon by some list members but if you aren't making a show vehicle and
want a good fix, it's great.

Good luck'
Shawn Soucy
