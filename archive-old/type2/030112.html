&gt; I'm trying to tune up my freshly rebuilt 2 liter air cooled.  I can't 
&gt; get it to breath correctly.  I have disconnected the crankcase

&gt; get what I consider good vacumn.  2 #s at idle at the throttle body 
&gt; and 6-7 #s at the distributor/ air distributor port.  

First, the reading at the throttle body is probably meaningless.  there is
no vacuum at the advance port at idle (you don't want the distributor to
be advancing at idle :-)

But second, the reading at the distributor box (this is the port on the
right side between the runners for cylinders 1 and 2, right?) is way low.  
Possible sources for the low vacuum are retarded timing and vacuum leak.  
Check your static timing (I know it's a T4, but if it won't run, static
will get you started) withg the Muir light bulb trick, then remove and
plug all the accesories, vac advance, vac retard, brake booster, aux air,
decel valve, and crankcase vent. Check vacuum reading.  If it's still low,
then the big hoses or the runner-to-head gaskets are leaking.  Add the
accesories one at a time and check after adding each.
  
&gt; Shouldn't my idle vacumn be around 10-15 #s?

I am satisfied with 15+&quot; of vacuum, with 17-20 being an ideal.  On my vac
gauge, this range says &quot;late timing&quot; but my vac gauge is set up for big
American V-8's which can run with way more advance than our air-cooled
engines.
