&gt; What start up procedure should I use to insure good piston ring wear-in?

Another easy one.
Insert ignition key and turn clockwise.

Rings are seated by variable rpms.
Drive and accelerate to 30 mph and sustain for five minutes.
Increase and accelertate,sustain, followed by decel at 40, then 50 mph.
Follow with accel and decel to 30, 40, and 50 in sucession.
Rinse, wash, repeat.
Rings must work themselves at the top and the bottom of the ring lands.
Or simply drive carefully with no particular pattern of procedure and no
high speeds for 100 miles ( or more ), and the rings will seat just fine.
If they don't, get some more rings.
You did glaze break and wash the bores ?
