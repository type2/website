My name is Jeremy I am 20 and I have recently diped in
to the world of my 1981 Vanagon L, I must say it is in
bad shape right now I am working on the fuel system,
trying to get it to run agin and out of the grass and
in the gravel. Right now it runs for 5 seconds back
fires, when I say back fire i mean a good size fire
ball shooting out of the air intake, I think i can fix
that but any segustions would be extreamly helpful. :)
I am also woundering if any body has seen a electrical
diagram for the vanagon, the heating and vent fans
wont work nor wil the interor lights, none of the
doors lock but thats a problam i can deal with. I
bought it for $150.00 bucks and I think I got my
moneys worth. :) I would love to hear any comment or
sugestions.

   confused and baffeled
