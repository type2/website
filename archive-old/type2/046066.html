&gt; &gt;How in the world do you put Fuel Injection in a dual carbed beast??

&gt; It would have to be engineered, or fabricated and trial and errored to
&gt; death. The 1.7L never was delivered with FI. Then, of course, it wouldn't

the 1.7 BUS engine was never delivered with FI, BUT the 1971/72 411 came
with a 1.7 Fuel injected type 4 engine, and I have put one in my 78 using
78 FI components and it ran fine for over a year while I rebuilt my 2
