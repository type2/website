If any of the folk on this list were at the In-and-Out Burger
in Sunnyvale on Tuesday night about 9pm, thanks for the show.

For those who were not, a dozen bugs including a '54 and most
of a dozen busses including a '57.  This being California, 
comments on rust tended to show itty bitty things around 21-window
frames.  As a Bostonian, I've fallen through the floor of Beetle
#1 while driving, so cosmetic rust seems sublime.  And the guy
with the ?'65 blue metallic flake beetle he said he had bought
last week for $800 just made me wince.

The '57 bus was black. And lowered. Half the bugs were either
lowered or had engines too big for the compartment.  The lemon
and white two-tone squareback was a gas.
