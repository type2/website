Subject: Stainless mufflers for upright engines!
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id TAA20976

Old busses are swell, but the mufflers only last a few years. Then, they rust.
It appears that VW Heritage in the UK now has stainless mufflers for 
upright engines.
This, according to their ad in the current issue of VolksWorld. (April)
They want £67.50 (which comes out to about US$103.00). Yes, you have to pay 
shipping, but you avoid VAT (a hefty tax)
Seems like a lot, but for the anal-retentive among us (or for those that 
live in the Pacific Northwest) you NEED one.
It will last 10 years or more.
You can find them at http://www.vwheritage_dot_com/
Warning: there is no mention of the stainless mufflers.
(So don't go looking for a picture.)
