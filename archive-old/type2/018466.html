Two words.  Lifetime Guarantee
Even if they do muck it up...just go back and tell them to do it the right
way....eventually they'll listen to you when you go back for the 5th time...
if it rusts out.... go back and get a new one!
I don't know if their guarantee covers that though... I think it does.... its
been a while since I checked that out.... it was going to be something like $80
fore the muffler, $30 for installation... they have to install it in order to
give the guarantee

&gt; Went to Midas the other day to have a complete replacement of my exhaust on
&gt; the T*y*ta. Saw a bug up on the lift. Said to the guy, you replace Bug
&gt; Mufflers? He said, veery slowly, yes, we do. I pondered this for a moment,
&gt; and asked the inevitable question: do you guarantee them for life? He
&gt; paused, looking unhappy, and answered slowly, yes. I asked how much and he
&gt; said $100. (how much is a bus muffler german issue for a 68-71? About $90) I
&gt; thought to myself gold mine! Ok I don't have a bug. I have a bus, I don't
&gt; like mechanics, I do it all myself, but what if they could do the work for
&gt; me?
&gt; I know we are all a special group of individuals, who rely on our own work,
&gt; but what if the midas company is our &quot;stainless muffler&quot;? My mind reels with
&gt; the thought.
&gt; I will have to work up alot of courage to take the 69, 70 and 63 to the
&gt; shop, but I cant help but see the value here!
&gt; Your Thoughts?
