Subject: Re: [T2] Total Immersion (flood damage and buses)

&gt;I would gnaw
&gt; &gt; &gt;my arm off before buying anything made lately for less than $100.  Sears,
&gt; &gt; &gt;Makita, B&amp;D, no matter what, it's *ALL* garbage!


&gt;I can't say enough nice things about my 14V Makita cordless drill.  Yes,
&gt;it's made of plastic, but it has taken a 15 foot drop onto a concrete
&gt;floor without damage.  When doing continuous work, one pack stays on
&gt;charge, one pack on the drill, swap when they slow down, work all day.
&gt;
&gt;The good stuff is out there, but you won't find it at WallyWorld or buy it
&gt;for $10.

Maybe not, maybe so. My Makita 9.6v has been running since 1991. Two 
batteries, one on charge, one in use. Doesn't go very fast but it does 
anything I ask. When I get rich I'll buy a DeWalt or Bosch or Milwaukee. 
Actually I have the Makita for the little work and my big 1/2&quot; Milwaukee 
120v (non-cordless) for the heavy stuff. Yes, nice tools are worth their 
money.
