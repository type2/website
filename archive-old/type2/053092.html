Subject: need bad fuel sender 73+ vw tank

hi all,

I have a nice 73 tank with no sender that i wish to put into a
splitiwindow bus.

Since my bus has no gas gague i dont really need a sender that works, i
just want to plug up the hole without having to drill the tank to screw on
a block plate (just incase someone needs to use the tank in a bus with a
gas gague or i decide to add one later...)

Can anyone help me out? i'll pay shipping and a nominal sum perhaps, but
cant see spending the big bucks for a known bad part...

take care,

Steve
