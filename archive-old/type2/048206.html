Subject: [T2] Anyone have a Type4 in Split Bus?

Anyone have experience putting a Type4 motor in a late model Bus?  I've 
read the Archives and really didn't find any how to.  I'm going to but the 
65 (even though it doesn't have a Ambulance Fan) for $680.  But it needs a 
motor and 12 volt conversion.  I have a lead on a 72 with a bad body for 
$400, the motor has 76,000 miles on it.  How much work to making it 
work?  Can I cut enough out of the tranny to make the larger Flywheel work?
