  &gt; By the way, my end play had a final measurement of .002 just .001 under
  &gt;  spec.  Is that cool??
  Crankshaft end play determines how much oil the main bearings get for loads 
  pushing on the ends of the crankshaft.  It also is a factor in oil 
pressure. 
  
  If I were building an engine I'd want to hold that spec.
  
  I didn't rerun your #'s but 7.1:1 sounds real good to me.  Make sure there 
  are no burrs on the spacers.  
  I've gone through 2 engines in my '71. They had CR's of 6.9 to 7.3 and it 
  didn't make any difference that I was aware of.  The one with 7.3 lasted 5 
  times as long as the other.  Just be sure you never let the engine &quot;ping&quot;.  
  ANY preignition is dangerous.  It only takes a small amount of preignition 
  to 
  burn a hole in a piston.  Don't ask me how I know.  Keep in mind that you 
  can't always hear preignition in an air cooled, rear engine car.
  
  Your engine sounds like it's coming along real well.  What are you planning 
  for the exhaust system?
