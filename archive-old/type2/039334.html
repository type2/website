Subject: Gas Odor in an '80

We had an '80 vanagon camper with the exact same gas odor problem.  Jim tried to track down the problem several times, but, not having the time to really tear down the system and get to the root of the problem, we fell back on not filling the tank to absolute capacity.  Of course, that doesn't FIX anything but solves the odor problem!
