Check your front trasmission and the back 2 engine mounts.  If any of these
mounts is bad, the engine will shake, rattle and roll!!  (is that a song?)

&gt;Something is making 'clunking' noise when accelerating on 3rd and 4th
&gt;gear. First it was only 4th, but after we came home from honeymoon trip
&gt;across Europe last summer, it was 'clunking' on 3rd too.
