Subject: starter woes - Success

So - $40.00 Canadian for a new bosch solenoid - and $20.00 for the starter
shop to go through the starter and it's running great.  I think taking the
solenoid apart and cleaning it was a very good idea - but - if I'd known that
I could just get a new one for $40.00 I think I would have done that as
opposed to cleaning up the old one.  Anyway - after applying the power from my
battery directly to the body of the starter the solenoid problem was taken out
of my hands.
