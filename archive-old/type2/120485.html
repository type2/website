I've lost count of how many people have said exactly that, usually when
getting out of their Chrysler minivan...

&gt; In a month or so once i move and get resituated I'll
&gt; be in the market for another bus.
&gt;
&gt; I like the upright motor scene so im considering
&gt; '68-71. I had the '70 and it had a couple one year
&gt; only items such as the fuse box. So i may vere away
&gt; from that year.

Every bus has 1-year-only items of one sort or another!

&gt; I would like a '69 since its the year i was born, but
&gt; I just wanted to know are there any one year only
&gt; parts?
&gt;
&gt; I like the '71 for its disc brakes, are there any one
&gt; year only items?

The '71 has a number of 1-year and 2-year parts.  The front engine tin is
1-year-only (only year for the doghouse cooler in a bus) and the front
spindles, calipers, discs, etc are 2-year only ('71-'72)

I like my '71, but there is no &quot;best year&quot;
