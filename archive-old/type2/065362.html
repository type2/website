Subject: VDO news, Summit Racing

Volks,

I just got the PROPRTIONING VALVE! :-) that I ordered from Summit Racing
Equipment.  I really like Summit so far - I have ordered a couple of things
from them and they are friendly, ship quickly and cheaply, and have tons of
cool stuff in their catalog.  They are also open 24/7.  Picked up an
aluminum drive shaft for the Mustang (shipping $3.50) in addition to the
PROPORTIONING VALVE!  :-) (shipping $3.50).  Summit caters to the racing
crowd, especially Chevys, so don't expect to find any VW-specific parts
there, but it's still a great catalog to have... I opened up the newest one
(that came in the box with the PROPORTIONING VALVE!  :-)) and found some
stuff in the new products section that is worth mentioning.

VDO GAUGES!  And not just any VDO gauges.  These are supposedly a new
design, and they sound really trick.  Listen to this:

&quot;When they designed their Vision Series gauges, VDO didn't decide whether
to make them easier to read or easier to mount than ordinary gauges - they
did both.  VDO uses fiber optic technology to illuminate the gauges'
pointers.  You can't help but get an accurate reading, no matter what the
light.  VDO also did away with the annoying metal mounting brackets and
nuts with the Spin Lock mounting system.  The Spin Lock uses a spin-on
clamp which holds the gauges to the gauge panel.  That prevents panel
warping and keeps the gauges from spinning in the mount.  The vision series
gauges also feature computer balanced pointers for precise readings and
diffusers that allow you to change the gauge lighting to green or red&quot;.
VERY COOL!

I think I know why the VDO gauges just went on sale at RMMW - they're
probably trying to move old inventory before this new stuff hits the
streets.

The greatest thing listed is the following:

VDO 3-3/8&quot; 85mph Electronic Programmable Speedometer - features easy-to-use
calibration via LCD display.  Resettable trip odometer (Shows picture of a
nice looking speedo with an LCD trip meter).  $99.50 (120 mph version
also).

I called Summit on this one, cause I HATE not having a trip odometer in the
bus, and to my disappointment, they told me that the speedo doesn't have a
regular odometer - just the trip one!  Bummer.  I got VDO's number and will
call them tomorrow and ask them just what the heck they were thinking!  If
this thing had a regular odometer plus a trip odometer, It would be the
ultimate upgrade.

Still, this has got to be THE trick accessory to have in a bus.  I have the
fiber-optic lit gauges in the Mustang, and they look real nice.  I remember
thinking how cool they were when the new Mustang came out in 1987.  It
would also be nice to be able to program the speedo to compensate for
larger tires.  Good speedo!  Smart speedo!

In addition to the speedos, they have:

Mechanical

Water temp (265 F)
Boost (0-15 psi)
Pressure (0-30 psi)
Turbo boost (0-25 psi)
Oil pressure (0-100)
Oil pressure (0-150)

Oil temp (300 F)

Oil pressure (150 psi, two different impedances)
Trans pressure (400 psi)
Voltmeter (16 volt)
Ammeter (30 &amp; 60 amps)
Three fuel level gauges

All of the above are between $20 and $40, with most $26.99
