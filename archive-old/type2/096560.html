Subject: Re: [T2] Idle problem goes beserk

Chuck,

Vacuum leak...check all hoses.

Make sure *all* electrical is up to specs first(dwell/timing).

Check all fi connectors...especially the temperature sensor(tight?)

More after checking all of those...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Amigos,

&gt;  I have a problem. My 75 Westy 1800 AFI was running like new for months.
&gt; Two weeks ago I started noticing a slight problem idling, Nothing much,
&gt; just a little rough. I though, =93Self, this is my 5th injector messing u=
p.=94
&gt; So I added a small amount of Berryman=92s B-12 to the gas to clean the
&gt; injectors.
&gt;=20
&gt; It seemed to improve the issue slightly, but all of a sudden, I cannot ge=
t
&gt; the thing to start and idle without putting the gas pedal to the floor.
&gt; When it runs then, it is rough, and will NOT idle at all.
&gt;=20
&gt; I refilled the tank with gas (thinking I may have added =93too much=94 B-=
12,
&gt; which is unlikely) but it made no difference. All hoses are tight and in
&gt; their correct places.
&gt;=20
&gt; Any thoughts? Before I load this on a trailer and haul it 90 miles to my
&gt; closest VW mechanic?
&gt;=20
