What does it take to convert a pancake bus(78) to upright motor(bug engine
1600dp etc...)

I hear Busboys has a tin kit for that purpose, I have a crack at a 78 west
in pretty clean shape, but the motors fried.   Thoughts, comments on
conversion vs repair(I hear quality parts are getting scarce on the ground
these days).  comments on Busboys(I've heard of delivery problems from a
couple people up here in the great NW).
