&gt;I used a standard pair of circlip pliers, and it took me a couple of tires

&gt;the circlip out of its groove.  Once it was out, I grabbed the circlip again 
&gt;(and with it out 1/16&quot;, I was able to get a better grip on it) and pulled it

I asked because I remember Steve Dolan had a lot of trouble in the past and he recommended a beefy pair of snapring pliers IIRC.
