G'mornin list!
Working on getting my dual cars installed in my '72 westy. I picke dup a 
nice set of Solex carbs with the paper filter type air cleaner, charcoal 
canister, assorted hoses etc and a pipe that bolts to the top of the engine 
underneath the aircleaner, that the air cleaner box connects too. Three of 
the hoses on the assembly under the air cleaner are self explanitory. there 
are a few other connections off of this that I dont know where to route. one 
is a small hose that is capped with a screw, one is a large connection that 
has been welded shut, these both come out towards the fan. I am also trying 
to get the charcoal canister installed correctly, since this bus had been 
&quot;tinkered&quot; with by someone who knwos even less then I do its in sad shape. 
Lookign through the archives and my 3 manuals I cannot find a good picture 
or description of how to hook up the entire operation. The links referenced 
in the articles I pull up are no longer valid. Anyone have a good source or 
some instructions I can locate?

As near as I can tell, the charcoal canister has three connections, one on 
the right side that goes to the top of the air cleaner, one on the left side 
(the big one) that goes to a fitting on the engine tin for the fan to blow 
fumesr off the charcoal and through the air cleaner. The third hole (small 
one, also on the left) is for the line going to the fuel tank. My confusion 
is if I have this canister mounted backwards, as there are on the ceilign of 
the compartment fuel lines on the left and right side. the PO had removed 
the cannister and had like 4 peices of hose spliced together to just connect 
the two lines together. If there are two lines going to the fank for fumes, 
and only one fitting on the charcoal cannister, do i need a &quot;T&quot; to connect 
them, or does one of the ceiling mounted lines go elsewhere? (this is what 
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/123011.html seems to suggest)


If anyone can point me at some good pictures for how this is suppsoed to 
look fully assembled that would be great. I am trying to get this system set 
up like I imagine it was when stock (if the VW engineers felt something 
should be installed, I certainly am not smart enough to second guess them).

Also the carb linkage bar has an inverted domed cap on the right hand side 
to rest on the ball on the bracket on the carberator, the left side however 
doesnt have this. in the box of parts was a little white nylon insert that I 
THINK is supposed to rest on the ball for the left carberator, but it's 
diameter is such that it would nto stay in place inside the link bar. I am 
wondering if this piece might be worn and it used to have a shoulder that 
would stop it from falling inside the linkage? On the carb bracket there is 
also a tapped hole at the top so I might jsut be missing a smaller bracket 
that the left side of the linkage needs to be held in place?



What signify a few lives lost in a century or two?  The tree
of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of
patriots and tyrants.  It is its natural manure.

-- Thomas Jefferson (letter to William Stephens Smith, 1787)
