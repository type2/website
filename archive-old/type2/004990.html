Thanks Jim,

Just called the Time Fastener Co &amp; ordered the Timesert kit # 0127 for
repairing the tapered thread *for the oil sender* on the side of the case.
I spoke with John * the owner* .  He knew exactly what was needed to make
the repair.  Now it will be a permanent fix instead of trying to put
something on the threads to keep it from leaking.....

&gt; Actually if the 10mm threads are stripped you can repair them.  I just
&gt; completed the repair on a wasserboxer with a botched heli-coil job.
&gt; Whatcha gotta do is use either a keensert or a timesert.  These are
&gt; thread repair inserts that are actually small cylinders that have four
&gt; small splines that drive into the o/s threads after installation.
&gt;
&gt; For details see: &lt;http://www.timesert_dot_com&gt; and &lt;
http://www.newmantools_dot_com/kee.htm&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Now it's FIXED!! (one caveat though...  The 8mm Keensert uses a 12mm x
&gt; 1.25 tap which is a 'bastard' size.  Order the tap when you pick up
&gt; the insert.  It ain't in a standard metric tap &amp; die set.)
