San Diego has lots of splitties. I see at least one a day; I've seen three
splittie double cabs in the past two weeks. Perhaps everyone can come here
before the trip to Baja next year to pick up a splittie for the journey :).
The downside to the overabundance of splitties is that no one waves,
presumably because they are so common. Seriously, those looking for a
splittie should come here to vacation and find one. I would say that the
decent ones go for $2000-$4000. The worst thing that can happen is that you
go home sunburnt and with a stomachache from having too many fish tacos and
Coronas ;).

How many are splitties, though? It would be good to know there is an
abundance of these somewhere. I'm guessing there aren't 50 of
these vans left in Eugene/Springfield... or they are VERY well hidden.
You see one about every 2 weeks.

And then:
Here in Indiana, where rust runs rampant, you RARELY see a splittie. In
fact, I can't remember the last time I saw one!
