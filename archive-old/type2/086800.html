&gt; Also, definately replace the torque converter seal...it's just good practice 
&gt; every time you r&amp;r the engine. In Bob's list, it was unclear to me on what he 
&gt; said about where to place the seal...in my experiance, I have found that you 
&gt; do not push the seal onto the trans shaft all the way back...I did this once, 
&gt; and it leaked a big red puddle when I fired her up...had to pull the engine 
&gt; again to reset the seal...what works is to slide the seal on the transmission 
&gt; shaft till its just on and let the torque converter seat itself to the seal 
&gt; when the engine is slid into the tranny...

yup that is exactly what you do and what I meant and had the same
experience to learn from
