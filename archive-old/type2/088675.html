Subject: Re: [T2] Quick Question Oil Cooler 16oo 1969

I did not see any replies to this.
Here is a site that may help:
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/oilcool.htm


&gt; Hi Folks.
&gt; 
&gt; Just replaced the oil cooler in a 1600 and the 2 round
&gt; gaskets were different than the ones on the old oil
&gt; cooler.However so was the part of the oil cooler that
&gt; contacts them.  The new gaskets are just a simpe
&gt; cylinder opened on both ends, while the old one was
&gt; tapered. Can anyone tell me if this change is by
&gt; design before i put my engine back in.
