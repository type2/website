Subject: Re: [T2] leaky master cylinder grommets

Ed, 

Sounds as if the o'rings got cut or torn installing
into the master cyl, if it were a new (ie:no fluid)
cylinder I would suggest you hone the edge of the
holes to get rid of any burrs, after packing something
in the hole to keep bits from entering the cyl and
blowing clean with compressed air. As it stands now I
would suggest removing the cylinder and check the
bores where the reservoir inserts for burrs or nicks.
Use some lint free tissue to seal the bottom and
perhaps scrape the open end with a machinist's scraper
or deburring tool, while holding it upside down to
prevent anything from entering the cylinder, wipe
carefully and remove the tissue. Lube the seals with
brake fluid and assemble again. Must be a big leak as
the fluid pressure should not be much in the reservoir
actualy, the other problen could be the cups are
blowing by fluid and over pressurizing the reservoir.
I replaced a MC in my Datsun 510 years ago with a
&quot;factory&quot; part which had a too long push rod that kept
the fluid from returning,(cups never passed the bleed
back hole)&amp; brakes kept locking up and I had to
&quot;bleed&quot; the cylinder to get moving again. All parts
are not created equal.
