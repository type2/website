Subject: [T2] Rubber Revitalization, 'Thuking' sounds and valve adjusts.

Thanks for all the responses, to the rubber revit. and the 'thuking' sounds.
I really appreciate all your help, Volks, so thanks again!  I'm going to try
and check it out this weekend.

I haven't gotten any response on that huge post I put up about doing a step
by step valve adjust, so I'm assuming it was either completely correct or
wasn't read by anyone with an opinion.  Either way, thank you, to those that
read it.  I hope it proves useful to someone!

Thanks Volks!
