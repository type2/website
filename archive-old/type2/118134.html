Subject: Re: Window scraper

&gt;Does anyone have an experience with poor fit of the front door window
&gt;scraper (inside and out)? OEM vs. German vs. other?

yes.  wcm stinks. i installed one of theirs a few yeears ago, big mistake
and waste of time. wimpy metal, wimpy rubber, which didn't fit tight to the
window. i always take the time to remove low-mileage window rubber parts
from yard buses.  in case you find one in a yard, and you need some key
removal tips p-mail.    - steve
