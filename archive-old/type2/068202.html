I looked at my collection of Owner's Manuals and dug up the 1956 Beetle's 
manual and it lists both a &quot;Bosch&quot; and &quot;Hella&quot; headlight by name. In fact, 
it shows the European rather than US versions of the lights...

However, the 1961 Transporter manual shows the &quot;Bosch&quot; diagnal adjustment 
screw version only....as does my 1966 Transporter manual. 

Go figure.
