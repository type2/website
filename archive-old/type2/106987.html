Subject: Re: [T2] unpadding dash

&lt;&lt; Hi,

Discussions of installing gauges, personal dissatisfaction with 
current gauge location and dash padding in poor  repair finds me 
contemplating removal of the dash padding on the 68 bus. I know that 
late 60s bays sold in Europe were delivered sans padding. Anyone done 
this to their bus or have pics of how theirs looks?

Thanks

Technically, I think it's illegal to remove any safety device from a vehicle,
probably including dash padding. Might not be a problem for you in your
Bus, but an insurance co. 'could' refuse to insure such an altered vehicle
or refuse to pay medical expenses in case of an accident and injury...;-(
