Subject: Setting timing &amp; idle speed
Message-ID: &lt;373EDE4F.3E660DF5_at_fullcomp_dot_com.au&gt;

Probably a perrenial question but the library didn't seem to nail it ...

Dual Solex on a 74/75 2.0 lt type 2, distributer has single advance hose
connected to LH carb.

If I get the timing right with the vacuum line off and plugged, then
when I put it back on the revs jump approx 200 rpm &amp; the timing
advances.  I thought there was supposed to be no difference at idle
speed?

The only way I can then get the right idle speed is to screw the idle
speed screw right in.

Doesn't seem right.

I seem to be getting into a dual adjustment - adjust the idle speed
which affects the timing which I change which affects the idle speed
again etc and gradually work my way in to the centre.

Am I missing something?
