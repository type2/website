The AIRS list is not to be used for this type assistance.  Please do not
generate this as a thread on this list serve.  And by all means do not put
the AIRS name on the tag in front of it.

If any others of you are contacted by Adam Canton please inform me so I can
take appropriate steps to alleviate the problem.  if Adam needs assistance
fixing his bus while not on the road he can poll the type2 list himself.
