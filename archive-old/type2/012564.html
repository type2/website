Subject: a different rear valance question
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello list.

I have searched through the type 2 archives and was
looking for a distributer that sells the removable
rear valance, rear apron, what ever you want to call
it. I didn't find one. I probably just overlooked it.
does any one know of a dealer that sells a aftermarket
removable rear valance for a 1968-72 type 2. I want to
convert mine from a non removable one to a removable
one. I have access to a body shop, so the conversion
shouldn't be a problem. Thanks!

David Kelly from Wilmington, North Carolina
