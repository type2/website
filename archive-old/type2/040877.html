How is the power?  Does it feel like it's running on two cylinders or four
under power?

My guess is that the idle circuit on the right carb is messed up somehow.
Since it is only on one side of the engine that pretty much rules out
anything electrical, except possibly the distributor cap.

One test you could do is to manually pour a small amount of gas into the
right carb while the engine is idling.  Use a small baster and just put in
a slow stream of drops or you will flood it.  If the idle speeds up, that
indicates that your right carb is not supplying fuel mixture to the
cylinders at idle.  Check for a clogged idle jet/orifice.
