Subject: accufire ignition

I've searched the archives and found that the old accufire didn't have much
good press, but the &quot;newer&quot; ones were better.  I helped a friend put one in a
'71 stock 1600 with the stock vac assist dist. and couldn't get it to time.
When we hooked up the light to static time it, the light stayed on all the
time????  Anyone else had this problem?
