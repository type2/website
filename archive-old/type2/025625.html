&gt; Well once again I come to you all for some advice.  I have a 1970 bus, with
&gt; a single 34PICT2 carb. I have put a rebuild kit on it, and it now idles,
&gt; but does not want to accelerate cold or warm.  The eletric choke does not
&gt; work but I am not all that worried about that cause that is easy.  I have
&gt; adjusted the card as per the Bentley book, and still have the same problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Help please I would love to drive my little bus.

Little? 

Take the carb back out and take the lid off. Fill it with carburetor cleaner
and actuate the throttle lever. There is, or should be, a little brass tube
coming up from the body of the carb, forming kind of a U shape, and finally
pointing down into the carb throat. This is your accelerator tube, which is
hooked to the accelerator pump, and when you use your hand to &quot;accelerate&quot;
the carb some fluid should squirt out of this tube.

I'm thinking one of four things--
a) your accelerator linkage is misadjusted. There's a rod going to the pump,
which if you hold the carb so the throttle lever is to your left side the
accelerator pump is close to the bottom of the carb on the right side. You
will see a brass rod with a plastic nut on it, and it should be hooked to
the accelerator pump so that it pumps when you step on the gas. Adjust the
plastic nut as necessary.

b) the accelerator tube is clogged. If it's not badly clogged. a can of
spray carb cleaner will help clean this out.

c) the accelerator tube is pointed at the wrong thing. It needs to point
straight down the middle of the carb throat. If it's not, either the engine
won't run or it won't accelerate.

or d) this tube's not there; sometimes you take it out to clean it and don't
put it back. Happens to me, anyway. If it's not there you get kind of a weak
gurgle of gas, which doesn't take you anywhere fast.
