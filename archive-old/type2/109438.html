Subject: RE: [T2] Anyone get email from Busdepot in the last couple of
  days?

&gt; Just wondering if I'm being paranoid. I've emailed Busdepot 
&gt; yesterday and today via Ron_at_ and orders_at_ etc, but haven't 
&gt; recieved a reply. Perhaps they're just busy. I wanted to ask 
&gt; a question and add to my order, but havne't recieved any 
&gt; replies. I know they're busy so maybe I'm just your typical 
&gt; anxious customer. :-) Courtney


Courtney, I sent you a response a little while ago. Please note that we
do ask that you allow roughly a working day for email replies  Generally
Cheri checks emails a couple of times each weekday. Many of her replies
are held in the outbox to be double-checked for accuracy by Dan, my
store manager, and then sent at the close of business or the next
morning. If your email happens to arrive after Cheri has done her last
email download for the day, it may be the next day before she sees it. 

The best email address to use is  sales_at_busdepot_dot_com . This reaches the
shop. Ron_at_busdepot_dot_com goes to my home office, not to the shop. Please
do not hesitate to use it if the issue at hand calls for my personal
attention/intervention. I read every email to that address personally,
but I do forward ones that are more general in nature to the shop for
response (as I can't check order status or inventory, look up invoices,
etc. from home anyway). Also, nobody at the shop checks that address, so
if I'm out of town etc. it won't be read until I return. Any other
busdepot_dot_com email address (i.e. type2_at_busdepot_dot_com, which is my list
subscription address, or orders_at_busdepot_dot_com, which is the originating
address of our automated order confirmation emails) is best avoided, as
we don't generally get customer inquiries at these addresses and could
easily miss one that got mixed in with other email.

Email is usually the best way to contact us if there is no serious time
urgency. Not only is it free, but it affords the sales rep the time to
more carefully and thoroughly research your answer (i.e. call suppliers,
pull a part off the shelf to look at, check UPS tracking, or even order
a sample from a supplier for inspection the next morning). Some of this
cannot be done as thoroughly by phone under a time contraint, given that
you may be on hold and getting increasingly irritated that the minutes
are ticking by as the rep leafs through reference books looking up
answers to your questions. On the other hand, if you need information
quickly, a phone call can get it to you faster than email. We're open
weekdays 11-7 eastern time. (215) 234-VWVW for anything other than an
order by part number; 1-866-BUS-DEPOT for orders by part number within
the U.S. (That number reaches operators who can only enter data, nothing
more.)
