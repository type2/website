Subject: [T2] Film shoot pics are up, speaker req'd

Hi Volks,

I managed to HTML the pics from the film shoot that the Über-Kamper and I
went out on a couple weeks ago.

If you want a look, check out www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2/filmshoot . There
are a couple of prints that I still have to scan, but the bulk of the images
are already up.

Some time ago I bought a pair of 4&quot; VW door speakers but it turns out one is
blown. If anyone has a spare (or knows of a likely scrapyard donor) they
want to part with please let me know. I think they came from an older
Jetta.. I have installed a set of Pioneer 120W 6x9's in the Z-bed base but
they still need a bit of help up front, especially when the bus is fully
loaded and there's a cooler or sleeping bag in front of them.

There's a pic of the speaker at

Happy trails,
