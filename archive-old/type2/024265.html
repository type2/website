Hi Volks,
	  I agree that we could so with a type2-specific oil FAQ, but
part of the problem is that there isn't an easy answer. The existing
oil info in the technical library is a little short on practical
advice, though providing good background.

 The advice I took when I bought my first type-2 was

 &quot;Don't use cheap oil.&quot;

 After that, the actual brand, viscosity etc. that is chosen depends
on your climate, your driving, what's available in the areas you drive
in and your personal choices about how often to change the oil, how
much you're prepared to carry with you (vs. buying from a gas station),
how much you're prepared to spend and so on.

 There seems to be a general concensus that low viscosity oils may be
too thin for an aircooled engine, that multigrades break down more 
quickly in our engines and that synthetic oils may offer better 
protection but still require frequent changes and hence are expensive.

 In conclusion my reading of the situation is:

- VW recommend 30W or 20W50 for most climates. 
- Extreme temperatures will probably exceed the working parameters of 
	these oils.
- This advice is dated.
- Modern oils are &quot;better&quot; than the ones in use when this recommendation
	was written.
- Many modern oils are designed for close-toleranced watercooled engines.
- Synthetic oils are top quality, but expensive.
- If using synthetic you should still change frequently 
	(because of combustion byproducts etc.).
- You should use a &quot;good&quot; brand.
- The viscosity needs to match your climate and usage.
- If you are frequently a long way from home you should take that into 
	account	when choosing an oil (Carry extra? Use a common product?)
 
 I don't know if there's anything to be gained by recommending specific
products, or even by collecting recommendations- most of this info can
probably be gleaned from the archives. On the other hand a list of what
type of oil people use and why might be useful for reference, especially
if it included information on climate and typical vehicle usage.
 Anyone want to collect this? I'm kinda busy at the moment... :-(
but the approach I'd take would be to trawl the archives for relevant
posts, summarise and tabulate the information, post it to the list for
further input and then arrange for the updated version to go into the
library at type2_dot_com.

Cheers,
	W.
