Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel Problems

I had essentially the same thing happen on the left side on my way to Florida.
By some miracle of fate, I had just gotten off the interstate and was cruising
a backroad when the tire started rubbing the wheel-well arch. I was going slow
enough and was able to stop fast enough before the tire was too badly damaged.

What you need to do is tight the nut down. I use a heavy hammer to pound the
crap out of the wheel nut tool. The cotter pin holes are slightly offset so
when one gets covered, another opens. Pound until you really think it can't go
any further. Then use a stainless-steel cotterpin that requires force to get
into the hole.

If the metal is too soft and the pin is loose, the nut will work loose and
split the pin.

-Eric
