Subject: rebuild - 2.0

Hey, guys.  I went down and picked up my new (old) 2.0  today.  $50!  I'm going to rebuild it and keep it in the  garage.  Question, how do I want to store it?  What can I do  in advance and what things should I wait to do right before I install  it?  I want to do as much as possible in advance.  
  
  My 1.7 is running so sweet right now that I wouldn't even think of  changing it.  In fact, it is running better, cooler, and with more  power than it ever has.   
  
  For the 2.0, I need a set of cylinders.  The jugs were gone off  the engine.  A new piston/cylinder set is $479 at BD.  I'd  like to find some original ones and re-line them.  Anybody have a  set they can part with?  I'm going to spend a bundle just on  heads.  You know, you can buy a rebuilt engine for what you put  into doing one yourself.  And I'm just talking about parts!  
  
  Next I want an 091 in my garage that I can rebuild.  Then I'll be set.  Cheers....KR
