Subject: Why do we paint tin?

	I've been lucky enough to score work space in a professional shop in town,
and as I sat in the barrel of Safety-Kleen scrubbing my grubby tin in
preparation for a marriage with an AVP longblock, I got to wondering: Why do
we paint tin? I've always been told Rustoleum, maybe the high-heat kind.
Presumably this is a dumb question, but I guess the underside will rust if
it's wet.

	Er, will it?

	Cheers,
	Ian
