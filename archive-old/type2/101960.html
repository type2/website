Subject: Re: [T2] Disc brake problems

It is also possible that you have junk in your master cylinder.

When you push fluid out into the wheel cylinders, it has to be able to 
come back as well.  I have seen(71 bug MC) where there was minute garbage 
in the MC and the fluid would not flow back correctly(or quickly).

If you stop the bus and don't press on the brakes for a while, do they 
release the rotor?....probably junk in the MC blocking the return valve.

Cheers, dave

&gt;  Here's the problem; ever since I did the swap, after I drive the bus for 
&gt; about 5 miles or so the front brakes start to drag, eventually they will lock 
&gt; up if I don't stop and crack open a bleeder. Once I release the pressure from 
&gt; either side, the brakes back off and  I can continue, starting  the cycle all 
&gt; over again. I replaced the original brake lever with one from a 71 since the 
&gt; arm is just different enough to make it difficult to achieve the proper 
&gt; amount of freeplay at the master.
