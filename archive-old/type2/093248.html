Subject: Re: [T2] fuel leak - and tossing used parts


&gt;it was about 150$ to replace the fuel pump, i think they are rebuildable
&gt;but i haven't tried to rebuild mine yet. i would take care of the pump,
&gt;not the leak. also have you checked your other fuel lines just for gp, the
&gt;one to the left of the engine compartment hidden up in the air well on the
&gt;side of the gas tank, that one cause a major gas fume issue for me cause i
&gt;couldn't find the leak....

For those of you with apparently re buildable fuel pumps and carbs - that 
decide to replace instead: Please save these from the trash and offer them 
to the list. I try to stock pile a few of these spares as while they may be 
plentiful now - they may be hard to get in ten years and more cost 
effective to rebuild.

I have rebuilt carbs and pumps with good results. This is common in Italy 
and I expect common in other countries as well. In Italy you bought brake 
shoe material and reriveted them on yourself for example. I did this a 
couple of times with good results on two cars.

I am inclined to rebuild OEM parts versus South American parts...
