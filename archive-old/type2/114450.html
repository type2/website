Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Job Questions

I had to replace the metal lines on my bus because the fittings were 
frozen. One was frozen onto the flex hose, the other side was frozen 
onto the wheel cylinder. Both had to be cut. I also managed to mangle 
the emergency brake cable pretty badly--but that was largely because I 
am an idiot.

The metal lines should be readily available at your FLAPS... I don't 
recall the correct length (see &quot;idiot,&quot; above.)

Because the wheel cylinders are cheap and easy to replace, seems like 
it would make sense to do that now.

One last thing--if you DO replace the metal lines, you'll probably need 
some of the rubber...I guess you'd call them bushings...that keep the 
metal lines from rubbing against the frame. One of mine ripped and the 
other simply vanished into thin air.

&gt; Hi Gang,
&gt;
&gt; I'm planning on doing a rear brake job on my 77' and had a couple 
&gt; questions.
&gt; My challenge here is that I live downtown, so I can't leave a vehicle
&gt; sitting with the wheels off for more than a few hours...therefore I 
&gt; need to
&gt; have ALL the parts on hand before I start.
