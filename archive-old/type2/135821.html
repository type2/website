Subject: Re: [T2] altitude and performance, the bigger question

&gt; Is the loss of power a compression issue related to the decrease in
&gt; ambient pressure?  

Yes. 

Someone here called sea level a natural &quot;Ram Air&quot; and it's true. Your
engine is an air pump. Plain and simple. The issue is that at altitued
there is less air in a give cubic inch. Your pistons pull the same
VOLUME of air regardless of altitude, but in that volume the air is
less dense so has less fuel (oxygen) for the explosion that pushes
your pistons and turns your wheels.

My questions related to the practicalities of tuning my particular
carbs. I was under the mistaken impression that with less air being
sucked in, less fuel would get sucked out of the jet along with the
air. But apparently the VOLUME (again with that word!) has more effect
on fuel delivery than the acutal mass. (Which leads me to wonder why
modern FI systems use a Mass Airflow Sensor, but that's another
topic.)

If your engine could change its volume based on the actual mass of
air, then also increase the compression to get that mass into the same
volume as at sea level, as well as correctly meter the fuel delivery,
then you wouldn't see any performance change.

Anybody wanna design an engine that can do that? ;-)
