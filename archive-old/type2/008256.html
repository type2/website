Subject: weber carb conversion
Priority: normal
X-mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v3.01b)

hi everybody,
	I have an automatic bus which has been converted to a weber 
carb. The bus ides fine but when you try to give it gas it stalls. It 
appears that the accelerator pump isn't doing anything. Can you 
purchase rebuild kits for these carbs. Its just a single carb not dual 
carbs. Its on a 73 1800 type 4 engine. Also where is somewhere i 
can get some more information on thses. I would appreciated any 
advice others can give on this conversion. Will the stock vacum 
dist do fine or will i need to purchase a different kind? Any tuning 
insights?

Thanks
