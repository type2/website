&gt; Howdys.
&gt; 
&gt; They just showed us this Nova video in my epidemiology class on Chinese
&gt; esophogeal cancer, and I caught a glimpse (a very brief glimpse, mind you,
&gt; I was kind of dozing) of a thing which looked almost exactly, but not
&gt; quite, unlike a type 2.  No, no, just kidding, apologies to Douglas Adams.
&gt; But it wasn't a VW, I don't think, but looked very much like a bay-window.
&gt; Anyone know any more?  Might be an interesting conversation piece.
&gt; 
&gt; Also in interesting news:  I think it a fair statement that the Corvair was
&gt; an attempt by GM to emulate the bug, right?  Anyway, they didn't stop at
&gt; the bug.  Did you know there is an air-cooled, small van/bus thing called a
&gt; Corvair something or other?  A very bizarre vehicle indeed.
&gt; 
&gt; Just meaningless chatter,

Eric and others,
The Chinese do very well at pirating consumer goods, even automobiles.
I have seen a photo in Newsweek of a Chinese pirate copy of a Jeep Grand
Cherokee, it looks almost just like a real one, but something's not
quite right.  I'm guessing this &quot;VW&quot; is either a pirate copy, or a car
made by a Soviet or Chinese (are there any Chinese automakers?)
automaker.
