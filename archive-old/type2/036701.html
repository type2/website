Subject: Cut some metal, found a home.

Well I found a vw repair shop that wants to take my 69 for donor parts.
This makes me a lot happier than sending it all the the crusher. Ive sent
out bits from it for anyone that posted a need over the last few months
and have a couple more pending. Today I cut chunks of the rear decklid to
fix the 64 which Ill finally be able to get back into. Oh happy tired day.
