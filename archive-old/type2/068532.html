&gt;One dislocated thumb is WAY too many.

My father in law, a long time volkswagon driver (he learned to drive in the
army;-) has lots of advice about cranks. One of which is how to hold the crank.
Do not straddle the handle with your thumb. That is don't hold the handle
clenched in a fully formed fist. The thumb has to be on the same side of the
handle as your curled fingers. Why? So when it kicks back, it rips out of your 
hand without removing, breaking, or spraining your thumb.

Of course he can also tell you how to get the steering wheel of the end
of the crankshaft of a tractor when using the removable steering wheel to
crank it, and which way to run if you fail to remove the wheel.

Just your basic 'common sense' from the thirties. Just like don't straighten
you leg when kicking a big bike. especially a big old single.
