Subject: Re: 7/8&quot; Anti-Sway Bar Clamp

I did this on my '69 Westy. I installed a set (front
and rear) of 7/8&quot; Sway-Aways...what a tremendous
difference in handling!!! :-)

And yes, the front clamps were a bit tough to get back
on. I used a set of channel-locks to press the two
pieces together, so that I could get the clip started
(even with the channel-locks, I had to fight to get
the clip to even begin to go over them), and used a
hammer to beat them into submission!!! It *will* work,
even thought it seems impossible.

Don't forget to bend the retaining tab back in place
when you're done!

&gt; ever fit, i have tried to

&gt; where?
