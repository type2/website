Subject: Procedure: basic getting an engine to run (was: Lost post :-( )
  (fwd)

Jason, Scott, Chuck,

THANK YOU!!!  I am gonna start, when I do a post that contains a
&quot;procedure&quot;, to put that word in the subject line.  I thought I done that
with this one, or at least used the word &quot;engine&quot; fer gosh sake!  OK, now
it's in again (three times :-) with the key word in the subject.

WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO TO GET THE ENGINE TO RUN

 To get a non-running bus started when you are lost, you need to check the
 four things you need for a running engine:
 Fuel -
  FI -
   Check fuel pressure while cranking
   Fuel pressure = 32PSI?
   Check fuel delivery to cylinders.
   Pull fuel rails away from the intake manifolds and run them into paper
     cups - are all 4 spraying during cranking ? good pattern?
  Carb - (not my forte')
   Check for flow from gas pump into a paper cup.
   Check for accelerator pump function
   set initial adjustments per Bentley/Muir
 Air -
  Manually check *all* vacuum hose connections Take 'em off and put them
   back on.
  Check vacuum while cranking, should be at least 10&quot;
  New air filter
 FI-
  Check throttle body butterfly
 Carb -
  check choke and throttle butterflies,
 Compression -
  Valves = .006?
  compression = 90+ in all 4 cold?
 Spark
  Dwell = 50 *exactly*
  Verify by observation that #1TDC is *really* #1TDC
  Timing = 7.5 BTDC static (don't matter what dist, for this excercise,
   trust me, 7.5 vor static)
  Pull the plugs and ground the base. Watch for spark.

If you do all these, your engine will start. The problem is to actually do
them without &quot;knowing&quot; any is correct and skipping that step. It's really
hard, you have to trust me. Cover all the bases and the ump will score the
run, miss *any* base, and you're out :-)
