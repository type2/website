Subject: Formula V engines

Shot the breeze the other day with a guy about Formula V engines he said
they can  squeeze up to 55 HP out of a totally stock 1200- 40 horse!? Is
this true or are they picking up the extra ponies with carbs and extractors
and whatever externals they are allowed to use? He mentioned the names of
some of the supplies and builders, never heard of any of them, must be a
whole different branch of the family tree. He said they are the most
precisely built, perfectly balanced of all the specialized Vdub engines.
Well if so they probably cost a mint but if a guy could get a deal on one it
would probably run forever, Would'nt it?

Just Wonderin'
