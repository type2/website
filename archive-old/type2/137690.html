Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck Gas Cap

You certainly bring up a good mystery with the conflict in your
sources. I hesitate to make assumptions without examination of sample
vehicles. I have a late 60's bay in storage at my friend's. I'll have
to check it out when I get better.

 I believe the hole is shown here as # 30A:

 The engine panel is  # 29.  ETKA shows this in all the pics of 68 -
79 bus body parts,
 but it is not shown in my old printed paper 68-71 parts book. Neither
is 30A. Since both
 are pictured in ETKA but both show as NLA, I cannot give you a
breakdown of which
 year model they started in. But since my paper parts book is dated
2/71 and they are not
 listed or shown there, then it is logical to assume those two parts
came later......
