Subject: [T2]oil cooler mounting 76 bay

got a external oil cooler i need to mount
  curious about how some of you would go about this...
   
  my reason is i dont want to run it far from the engine bay but i need it to get air and have the right place..
   
  now i have a friend that has a vanagon and has his mounted on the (looking from back) left back tire just above it...
   
  thing is my 76 bay doesnt have enough room there i dont think?
   
  i seen one the other day that was mounted just on the outside of the body of the bay ( left back side)and was pretty ratty IMHO.
   
  but i got the idea that it would have plenty of air passing through it...
  it had a piece of tin over the top of it but was open on the sides front to back....and mounted Vertical.(up and down)
   
  i thought this would be a good idea if it was incased in a nice looking grilled type metal fabricated kinda thing a ma jig..but mounted somewheres else .... something nice and not something shady like on the bus i seen for sale yesterday. got a pic of it i can upload if anyone is interested....?
   
  Its the time of year here that my bus really works the hardest and hottest and i have more and more each week to load on her so the external oil cooler is now a must to get the temps down on the oil temp gauge...
   
  thanks for all pictures and knowledge on this.
