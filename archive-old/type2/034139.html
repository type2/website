Volks,

  I dont have a tach and was wondering on my 72 poptop pancake, what is my 
rpm in relation to speed in each gear. As in, when should I go from 2-3rd and 
3rd to 4th what speed is a good shift speed and where is my rpm at that time 
on a 1800??? We have lots of long tall hills in CO  and I would think Ill 
need to climb in 3rd maybe 2nd, where would be a safe long 3rd and 2nd 
climbing speed\rpm.
   Tachless in CO
  Thankyou,
   David
