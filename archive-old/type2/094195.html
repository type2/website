Subject: re: [T2] Stuck Lugs on the left rear of a 72

Hi Doug,

For Guaranteed Results: Heat the nut with a torch. Then get an impact socket
set in a 1/2&quot; breaker bar with a 6' pipe extension. Either the nut comes off
or the stud will shear.

Use a breaker bar from Craftsman or Snap-on that has a lifetime guarantee; I
have seen a 1/2&quot; breaker bar shear when removing an axel nut but I wouldn't
expect it with a lugnut. But you never know...

Torching the nut off is your next best course of action.

In either case be prepared to replace the stud when you're done, it sounds
to me like someone installed the wheel with a domestic lugnut and the
threads on that stud are likely damaged.


Happy trails,

&gt; Ok I have soaked em down with every known penetrating oil I can find, I have
&gt; taken an electric impact and an air ratchet to them, I have bent 2 tire

&gt; cutting them off, any other suggestions would be VERY helpful.
