Subject: emissions testing

Gentlepersons-
                       In light of the ongoing debacle over emissions testing 
in NJ (and one of
many reasons why my '71 Bus wears historic plates), I was curious if the 
&quot;vendor&quot;,
Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, the operator of the inspection 
stations
(Ah, privatization, I love thee), was also conducting inspections (with up to 
five hour
waits), in other states. Apparently, I'm not the only one curious about the 
Parson's
Group...The NJ State Independent Commission of Investigations is questioning 
why and
how Parson's became the sole bidder for the half-billion dollar contract from 
my state.
Any other info on Parsons would be helpful. Lest you other-staters think this 
has no-
thing to do with you, just ask anyone from California, what kind of snake pit 
testing
can become for the chronologically challenged car/bus owner...For example, 
are there
any owners out there still waiting for their $300 refund for attempting to 
&quot;import&quot; a
car into California and were fined the said amount...Think it's crazy? I know 
of the owner of a '49 MG TC who's still waiting...
