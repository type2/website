Subject: Re: dizzy for rebuilt bug

I have a couple of
&gt;extras that I could mail you to put into this bug.



Would that make you a distributor distributor?


I am giving her the 009 - with a little hesitancy since indeed it was my 
carry-on-board spare. But I can keep her old stock one as a spare -- I'll 
just disconnect the vacuum biscuit.

Or maybe you have a nice 009 to trade for her old one?


Thanks man!
