All,

Today I went out to start my 79 Westy, and when I turned the key, no start. 
Nothing else out of the ordinary occurred to indicate that the starter might
be bad, ie: the starter did not click, nor did the dash lights dim like it was
trying to kick over the starter.  I am thinking that it is the ignition switch
that exhibits these symptoms.  When I turned the key to the on position the
fuel pump kicked on, and when I turned the key to the start position, cut off,
as did the radio.  

Could this be the mechanical part of the switch, the electrical part of the
switch, or are they one unit, or am I way off the mark.

If it is the switch, does anyone have the replacement procedure?

I've checked the archives, so far I have found how to replace the switch on
early busses, but what about late model busses?

Thanks in advance,

David
