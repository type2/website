Subject: Speaking of being stopped by the cops....

hey now,

last saturday i was coming home from work in the van on i-40 just past the
durham parkway. i noticed a durham police officer almost tailgating me...i
knew she was going to pull me over. i just waited. eventually she did and i
kept my hands on the steering wheel as i watched her crawl along the side of
the van, hand on gun while trying to peer through my curtains. she asked for
my liscense and registration....i gave her my liscense and couldn't find my
registration...duh! she goes back to her car and does whatever it is that
cops do when they pull you over. comes back and says my liscense plate doesn't
exist and wants to know where and what car i got it from. i politely explain to
her that this has happened to me before...and that i spent 3 hours at DMV
gettting it fixed. it should be fine. she insisted i had taken it off of
another car. i said, no ma'am, that ain't true. she strongly suggested that
i go back to dmv and straighten it out. she also added: &quot;Next time i see you
around here i'm going to stop you and check to make sure you have your
registration and that you have the right plates on there.&quot; i said yes ma'am
as i thought of the 10,000+ vehicles that must come through the area everyday.

i was waiting for the search question...i woulda said if you got/get a warrant
you can search...since i didn't have anything anyways. i could tell she wanted
to look inside.

so i'm off to dmv tommorrow. i don't know what is wrong this time. oh well.
