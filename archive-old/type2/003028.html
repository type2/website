Silly question, but did you check your oil? If yes, and the level was good,
you have probably either got low oil pressure or a bad oil pressure switch.
The second is not too likely - they usually fail in the not-going-on-at-all
mode, in my experience. You can try using some oil thickener like STP oil
treatment (the stuff for older cars) or just try a heavier grade of oil. I
used to use 2 bottles of the stuff at a time in my old Squareback, added
with the oil in an oil change in place of one quart of oil. This will often
make the pesky light go off and stay off (except on startup, of course).

(I know I'm gonna catch flak for this. STP got in trouble back in the 60's
for using something in the mix which varnished the cylinder walls pretty
badly, or that's the way I remember it. They seem to have worked that out
long ago, though. I've had occasion to examine engines run with the stuff
and they do not exhibit any ill effects, at least not any I would have
attributed to the use of this particular additive. And the stuff WORKS -
I've used it in dozens of similar cases. Also a great remedy for lifter
clatter in hydraulic valve engines.)

If you get no results this way, you can try pulling your pressure relief
valve(s) and cleaning the bores and valves - maybe one is sticking in the
partially relieved position. This is pretty unlikely, too.

If you do have success with the STP method, this is a pretty darn sure
indicator of low oil pressure, and you might start bracing yourself for an
engine overhaul.

If you DIDN'T check your oil, shame on you!

&quot;Now, driving my '71 today, my Oil warning light came on only at idle after
about 3 miles.  Every time I came to a complete stop it would come on but
even the slightest touch of the accelerator and it would go off.  Is this
just a low oil problem or something more serious?&quot;
