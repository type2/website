The Vanagon does very well, I will soon post pictures of the
old '86 in a 1 1/4 time on side roll over from 40 mph or so
that I did 6 years back.  The structure of the van was little
damaged.  As soon as I get this pesky home page thing up I'll
have em online, some saw the pictures this weekend at Seneca
and can attest to the lack of significant damage.  Those door
pillars are sterner than they appear.
