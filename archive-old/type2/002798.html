We (my son and I )  are more into the sound proffing thing.  Pulled the head
boards out that had be installed by the PO (I like mine).  That gets you to
some more ribs and hollow spaces, and will allow for more sound proofing.

Great Stuff is a mess. It comes out very fast at first and thens starts
burbing out for the last half of the can.  I drilled a few access holes to
reach some hollows.


I am wondering how much more sound deadening you get with Qpads or similar
products, versus something like rubber door mats. For the money, is it THAT
much quieter?, or is the question, 'If you are doing it , go ahead and do it
the best  even if the extra bucks only gets you , say15% more sound
reduction.'

Regardless, its fun doing bus stuff.
