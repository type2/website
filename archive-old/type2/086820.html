Subject: Re: [T2] why a stumble?

Chris,

You specified all stock, so I am going to assume that you also have a
stock distributor.

On my 78 stock 2l, you time it at idle.  At idle there should be no
advance signal coming in from the manifold vacuum..at least there isn't on
mine.

In other words, at the specified idle rpm, you should be able to either
connect or disconnect the manifold vacuum line and see no change in the
timing.  Just off idle on mine, I begin to see advance signal from the
vacuum line.

This confused me at first because I came from a bug world where you either
static time or time with the vacuum disconnected.

Stumbles when cold? or only when warm?

It shouldn't jump around much on the timing light either...nice and steady
at a certain rpm.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Volks,
&gt; I am looking for the cause of a stumble on my 78 2.0L FI (all stock).
&gt; 
&gt; The particulars follow;
&gt; 3K on rebuilt by AVP
&gt; new wires, plugs, points (adjusted to 47 degrees dwell), cap, rotor.
&gt; Coil is not new
&gt; timing set to 7.5 before
&gt; adjusted valves to zero plus 1 full turn
&gt; 
&gt; I finally got around to adjusting the valves per AVP after running the
&gt; new motor for a while. I had a slight stumble before the valve
&gt; adjustment, but now I have a significant stumble. It is intermittent, at
&gt; all RPMs except idle, maybe a little worse under load. Distributor
&gt; advances to about 28-30 degrees at 2500RPM (timing jumps around a bit at
&gt; idle (6-9 degrees) and at 2500 (26-32 degrees)). I have an appt to put
&gt; it on an exhaust sniffer tomorrow morning to ensure I am within spec
&gt; there. It feels like a big misfire. Otherwise it idles smoother and when
&gt; not missing seems to run better then ever.
&gt; 
&gt; As usual, your help is greatly appreciated!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Chris
