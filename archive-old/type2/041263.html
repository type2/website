Walt:

take a look at:

http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\type2_at_type2\Y1999\June\7706

I tried to find these elusive &quot;anti-squeal shims&quot;;  no luck.  I did,
however, replace the retaining clips that hold the pads in place.   This
significantly, but not entirely, eliminated that dreaded &quot;squeal.&quot;

Please let me (and the list) know if you find a source for those shims.
VWOA apparently doesn't stock them.

good luck.

Subject: New front brake discs/squeal


&gt;Hello Listers:
&gt;
&gt;I just installed new front brake discs and pads on my '76 Campmobile.  I
&gt;applied the anti-squeal goop on the backs of the pads.  I wiped the new
&gt;brake discs as clean as possible (did not use a solvent) before
&gt;installation.
&gt;
&gt;I didn't experience any squeal the 1st day after installation.  Now I'm
&gt;getting an ear shattering squeal when stopping in reverse and an
&gt;intermittent squeal when forward braking.  Braking is otherwisde sure and
&gt;solid.
&gt;
&gt;Do I need to remove the pads and apply more goop?  Should I have cleaned
the
&gt;new discs with a solvent?  Will the pads seat themselves eventually?
&gt;
&gt;The Bus is not my daily driver and does not receive high mileage usage.
&gt;
&gt;I could not obtain an hit in the archive.  Perhaps I wasn't using the right
&gt;key words; any help is appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Best regards,
&gt;Walt Fogle
&gt;'76 Campmobile
