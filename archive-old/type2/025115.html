Subject: '82 Air-Cooled Vanagon AdventureWagen
Message-ID: &lt;9f7abb69.24c346ef_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have a '68 crewcab, and I'm just finishing restoring a Thing.  I've been 
wanting a camper for some time.

I found an '82 air-cooled Vanagon Adventure Wagen this weekend and bought it 
because it seemed like too good a deal to pass up.  It was too much like one 
of those &quot;found a perfect one in a barn&quot; stories.  Now I'd like some advice 
on what I've gotten myself into.

The Vanagon was at an old garage in a tiny town in central Texas.  The story 
the man at the garage told me was that the V. had belonged to a rental 
company in Florida that mainly rented to European tourists who would fly into 
Florida and drive to California then fly home.  Then someone else would rent 
it in California and drive to Florida, and so on back and forth.  The engine 
developed unspecified difficulties when some Germans were in the middle of 
Texas.  The tourists left it and flew on.  The rental company essentially 
totaled it by selling it to a local wrecking yard because they didn't want to 
come after it.  The man at the garage bought it from the wrecking yard.  He 
was planning to make a hunting and fishing vehicle out of it.  He said that 
it was running then but making a &quot;bad noise&quot;.  Apparently he thought it was 
the heads, and he messed with it for a while.  Then he decided to let some 
friend of his whose credentials were that he had a Bug in the '60's mess with 
it.  He was able to drive it to the friend's house, but he had to tow it back 
a year or so later.  The friend never did much to the engine, but he did mess 
it up enough so that it won't run.  

Since he got it back to his garage, it has sat for the last 2 or 3 years.  
The man never tried to do anything more with it.  He's essentially retired, 
and his garage is a dump with lots of cars and parts around it in various 
stages of death and dismantlement.  The Vanagon does have Florida plates 
(expired), and he said he will mail the title to me Monday.  It's in his bank 
lock box, and he can't get it until Monday.  I'll try to run a history search 
based on the VIN if someone can give me a URL.  All CarFax could tell me was 
that it was a Vanagon.  Based on the Florida plates, etc., the story sounds 
logical.  It appears he lost interest in it, and since he was a mechanic when 
he was working, he probably didn't want to pay someone who knew what they 
were doing to fix it up.

Now the details - It is a Vanagon L with an Adventure Wagen conversion.  It 
has a fridge, stove, heater with thermostat, complete cabinets, etc., pull 
out bed and pop-up table.  The interior is complete and good, except the 
seats need upholstery.  All the glass is perfect.  The body is esentially 
dent-free with original paint and only a very few surface rust spots the size 
of a pencil eraser.  The fiberglass hightop is perfect.  Since everything is 
original,  the rubber around the windows is complete but dried out.  There is 
surface rust on most of the chrome window moldings.  The sliding door took 
considerable effort to open and close, but he said that was just needing 
grease.  He said he used the heater when it was running, and that it worked 
perfectly.  He did not use the fridge or stove.  If the story of the rental 
unit is true, I am assuming all appliances worked until it died.  It has a 
manual transmission and air conditioning.  He said the AC was blowing but not 
cold when he got it.  In summary, it appears to be complete right down to the 
owner's manual.  Nothing seems to be missing.

My questions - 

1.  Assuming the engine is totally fried, how much is the camper worth as it 
sits now.  I bought it for considerably less than he said he paid the 
wrecking yard, but it was drivable then.

2.  How do I procede?  Does it seem worth checking out the engine before I 
consider it at total loss and essentially toss it?  It also appears to be 
complete, except a couple of pieces of engine tin and air hoses, probably 
&gt;from the goobers that tried to work on it.  I don't want to spend very much 
money checking out the engine that could go toward buying a rebuilt.

3.  If I toss the engine, what are the list's recommendations for a 
replacement?  (Flame suit one) Another stockVW engine with FI or a 
conversion?  If a conversion, what kind?

4.  I reassured my SO by telling her the interior alone was worth more than I 
paid for it, but I don't really want to part it out.  I've always wanted a 
camper, but I was looking for a '78 loaf Westy or Riviera, but I have heard 
good things about the A-Wagen.  At least it has a full-width bed.  Except for 
whatever's wrong with the engine, it's a cherry Vanagon L.  Should I just try 
to part it out and keep looking for a '78? 

5.  Can someone give me a URL with more details based on VIN than CarFax.?

I'm 50 east of Dallas, if someone wants to look at it and give me some 
suggestions.

Thanks, David Hunt
