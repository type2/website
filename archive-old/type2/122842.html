&gt; The donations have reached the 2 k mark due to the generous donation of a
&gt; bus person in Florida who gave 1000 dollars and all the others that have
&gt; gave and the ones that still are. It started with SWATO doing a trivia
&gt; contest at BBB and donating the entry proceeds to the fund.

Umm, what is a &quot;SWATO&quot;?  :)

Actually the trivia contest was done by Save the Bays, (STB) with prizes
donated by Mike Visket (including a gas heater) and myself.

The winners of two of the trivia contest prizes turned around and donated
them to the auction held the next day.
