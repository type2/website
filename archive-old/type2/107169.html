&gt; Weber, Mike Boland found me a good used and complete 1978 2.0L FI.
&gt; The price for the complete FI is more than fair so why not try!!!!!!

&gt; Almost everything is out of the bus, so i was ready to remove the fuel
&gt; tank to add a fuel nipple return line for the FI.
&gt; But! why not use one of the existing ventilation nipple (look at the
&gt; picture):

I wouldn't tee the return line into the vent line unless you isolate
one of the vent fittings and use it exclusively for return.

Another idea is to make a custom outlet fitting with two tubes instead of
one.  Make one tube &quot;L&quot; shaped to put the return near the bottom of the
tank but about 10cm from the outlet.
