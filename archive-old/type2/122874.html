Subject: Re: Starting a road trip, need advice

Giles, I concur with Paul. Skip the desktop, invest in a notebook. If you
keep an eye on www.techbargains_dot_com you should be able to find a new or
refurbished one for well under $800. Although video editing will bring all
but the most powerful notebook PCs to their knees, there's enough horsepower
available even on the lowest-price modern notebooks for still image editing
purposes.

Sprint will cut you off if you try to pull more than around 50 MB/month
through your USB-tethered Vision phone connection; they've revised the
customer terms and conditions to explicitly state that the Vision network is
intended for access by phones and phone-inclusive PDAs only, not
phones-as-modems. For more on this, monitor the alt.cellular.sprintpcs
newsgroup. Alternatively, you can get a PCS Connection Card and sign up for
$80/mo unlimited data upload/download service through a Sprint reseller such
as www.sprintpcsrocks_dot_com. I've been using it in conjunction with Sierra
Wireless's card for about a year now and am quite pleased both with the
coverage and the speed. It's usable both on PCMCIA-inclusive Windows and Mac
OS machines....note that Apple iBooks do NOT have PCMCIA slots, nor does the
12&quot; Powerbook. Larry at RoadHaus is using Verizon's equivalent service
(which, like Sprint, employs CDMA 1XRTT technology).
