Subject: Re: [T2] White tack strip

&quot;There is a white tack strip at the top of the poptop securing the canvas to 
the fiberglass. What's prefered: using a new strip or re-using the old one 
with the staple punches in it?&quot;

When I replaced the canvas on my 79 westy last summer, I inspected the tack 
strips to see if they were still pliable/elastic.  They were.  I removed all 
of the staples and re-used the strips with no problem.  The canvas is very 
secure.  I'd only replace the strips if they are brittle.
