Subject: funky bus
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.981120193909.19864A-100000_at_ux8.cso.uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

ok heres the situation:

working on a friends bus:
1641 dp
.009
32/36 weber progressive
not stock cam (he doesnt know which, id say its a engle 100 or 110)
stock exhaust

problem is, it seems like its not firing on all 4 cylinders.  we
adjusted the points, and it started, but would not idle.  seems to run on
all four for a few minutes, then putter out.  i suspect its the carb, but
i have never messed with a weber.  plus the place he bought it off of sent
no instructions.  but it will start, even sounds good sometimes, but
sometimes it fires, but no idle whatsoever.  

any ideas?  especially on how to tune a weber 32/36, and what to time it
to.  its timed to 7.5 to 10 degress btdc right now.
