Subject: '74 Westy factory attached tent

Hi, I was going through my basement the other day, and forgot I have an
original westy &quot;striped&quot; tent complete.  I don't want to use it, but a fellow
VW &quot;friend&quot; said they are hard to get in such good condition, so if you are
interested, contact me off line: sydclarke_at_shaw_dot_ca and we can &quot;jaw&quot; on the
particulars.  Thanks,  and a good Canadian Thanksgiving to you all.
SQUID
