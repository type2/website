Subject: Gasohol and Octane

First, it is my understanding that gasohol causes premature wear to seals
and is not recommended by many auto manufacturers.

Second, most consumer advocate organizations have been reporting that
higher octane is only useful if you engine is pinging on lower octane gas.
They have discounted any other performance gains.  Can anyone verify a
performance increase from higher octane gas?
