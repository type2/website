&gt; Folks, I have a need to clean up some threads on some lug bolts

&gt; to do this that didn't cost beaucoup bucks.
&gt;
&gt; Like this one  http://www.eastwoodco_dot_com/email/default.asp?T1=28099
&gt;
&gt; Any opinions/hints?

Well, if you know the size/pitch, I'd think you could go purchase a die 
for it at any decent hardware store.  Buying just one die certainly 
couldn't cost $99.  I would think it'd be &lt; $10.
