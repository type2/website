I have a 74 Bay, with a 1641 Big Bore. I am in the middle of installing =
a seriously big entertainment system. During a few test runs I have =
managed to fry the standard 55amp alternator. I have a 90 amp hour =
battery and intend to install a second in order to give the system =
enough umph. I now need to replace the alternator and am thinking of =
going for a 75 or 90 amp thing, has anyone ever done anything like this =
before and would like to pass on thier invaluable knowledge to me.
