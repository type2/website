Subject: Re: [T2] One version of why we are &quot;orphans&quot; of VW

&gt; I find this irritation with VW a little misplaced. Yes, they have been
&gt; hostile to their legacy cars at the corporate level. But look at the
&gt; list of car companies that have completely withdrawn from the U.S.
&gt; market (or vanished completely) since our buses were new:
&gt; 
&gt; Austin (okay, BL)
&gt; Fiat
&gt; MG (BL again, then MG/Rover)
&gt; Peugeot
&gt; Renault
&gt; Sunbeam
&gt; Triumph
&gt; 
    FWIW, AC (oldest sportscar company in England) is opening
a factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut...Of course, at around
$100,000 a pop, the info is probably of limited use... ;-(
