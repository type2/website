&gt;&gt; I have a project bus in need of a new front &quot;face&quot;.

&gt; I think I can make a
&gt; '66 through '71 piece work, but obviously want
&gt; something dent and rust free.&lt;&lt;

What do yiou mean by &quot;face&quot; do you mean the entire
front nose panel?  If so, 66 and 71 are very different
animals.  66 and 67 would be the same, however 68-71
would be VERY different. What year is your bus?
