Subject: Re: [T2] R &amp; R Exhaust Studs - Northern Virginia

&lt;&lt;Your wrench is right Barry. 
Don't heat the stud, heat the area around it.&quot;&quot; 
Ok, but the area around it is Aluminum and I imagine that the Aluminum
will quickly spread the heat and take a LONG time to get up in
temperature.&gt;&gt;

Yep, you imagining right.

The aluminum will suck up the heat from the torch real fast, expand
around the studs and break the bond that holds them immediatly--Like
right now.

Now if only using a Home Depot
propane torch set up--it may take a bunch longer, and maybe not even get
hot enough to break them loose.

So--what kinda &quot;torch&quot; are you using?

I just got done doing the heads on one of my Vanagons.

Heated them studs with my oxy acyetelene torch ( didn't even try without
any heat ) laid the stud puller on them and backed them all out in 15
minutes.

Simple, clean , and pain free.

As Ole Bob Villa would say---

&quot;Right Tool for the Right Job&quot;

Adios,
