Subject: Automatic won't go into reverse ...

I have been told by a couple of sources, that the Westy automatics 
have trouble going into reverse sometimes.  This is supposed to 
happen more in cold weather, too. 

My &quot;new&quot; Westy developed this problem a week after I purchased it.  
When I first start out in the morning, the thing simply won't go into 
reverse.  You can hear it click, trying to engage, but it just sits there like 
it is in neutral.  About 2 miles down the road, reverse works fine.   The 
rest of the day it runs great and no problem until the next day when I 
get in it to start out.

I can deal with this by parking in a nose-headed-out position until I can 
afford to have the engine pulled again.  My question is this:  Am I going 
to damage the tranny by running it in this condition?  Doesn't seem to 
affect any of the other gears...

Thanks!
