Another good thing to do IMHO is to buy another working engine for around
$400 bucks, pop it in after work, and then work on rebuilding the other
motor at your leisure.  That is what I am doing.  Hell, I just bought an
entire parts van with decent motor for $350!

I would put my money on a rod bearing, turn off the engine and fix it, not
a major (read expensive) repair if the rest of the engine is sound, if it
seizes it will cost big bucks as it will cause major damage to the rest of
the engine.

ask me how I know  ;8*{
rent a car, it will be cheaper!
