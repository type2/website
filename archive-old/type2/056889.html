Subject: brake pedal feel

Hi

Just finished replacing my servo, flexible lines, and rear wheel
cylinders on my 78. The bus idles much better now, and doesn't drop to
400 RPM when I push the brake (!), but the brake pedal just feels wrong.

I barely have to step on the brake to stop... total pedal travel is less
than an inch... is that how it is supposed to be? I used to have to push
it past the gas pedal and the pedal was a lot easier to push... 

I adjusted the freeplay with the master cylinder off... is that where I
went wrong or does it not make a difference? I jacked up the bus after a
short drive and the brakes were not dragging, so I don't want to adjust
it so there is too much freeplay. 

Anyone with a late bus (I think the brakes were the same from 73-79?)
care to comment on how their brake pedal feels? It's going to take me a
while to get used to this...

Thanks,
Jeff

BTW- when I took off the rubber boot on my old servo 5 big chunks of
broken plastic fell out. the whole thing was all cracked up, and the
pusrod was bent. I'm surprised this thing worked at all...
