Message-ID: &lt;JCGLHCEHNKGMBAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

I just purchased a brand new TRW camshaft for the 2.0 liter engine I'm rebuilding and would like to attach my old, good gear. My plan is to carefully grind off the rivets and then bolt the gear on the new shaft.

I've heard that the bolts used for this are 'special.' Anyone have details/advice? I'm expecting to go to my local speed shop to get the bolts I need, but advice is appreciated here in this new territory for me.

Since it's almost Friday, I'll share: today a neighbor drops by with some stuff for the kid's Easter party at school tomorrow. *He* never comes over; it's always *her.* He no sooner steps in the door when he starts asking why his Rodeo is overheating. I guess a carport full of engine parts makes you an expert. That reminds me...there's a guy who lives on a bench not far from my bank...I've *got* to remember to stop and ask him about investment options tomorrow. :)

Thanks! Joe
