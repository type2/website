For anyone interested in replacing the &quot;push to reset&quot; circuit breaker =
in your Westy, the part is available from Mechanical Products, Inc. (the =
original supplier of the one in my bus).
Go to: www.mechprod_dot_com
It is the 125VAC, 15 AMP, series 252, at the bottom of the &quot;Commercial&quot; =
page.
Thanks to all who helped me find this part.

Another question, what is everyone's experience with the AVP rebuilt =
Type IV engines, such as offered by The Bus Depot.
