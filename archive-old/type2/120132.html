&gt;do ANY of you know ANY songs after 1974????    ;)

Well, the 70's were inspirational years for many of us... and my 
bus is a '73 which counts for something.  I figure playing music 
from Bluto's genre will make him happy.  Here's a sample of what I 
play on the road:

Blue Oyster Cult - Burning for you
Boston - Carry On
Cars - Drive
Charlie Daniels Band - In America
Commander Cody - Hot Rod Lincoln
Commodores - Brick House
Devo - Pop Music
Doobie Brothers - Listen to the Music
ELO - Sweet Talkin Woman
Foreigner - Double Vision
Jackson Browne - Running on Empty
Jerry Reed - East Bound and Down
Jimmy Buffet - Margaritaville
Joe Walsh - Life's been Good to Me So Far
Kansas - Dust in the Wind
Led Zepplin - Kashmir
Orleans - Still the One
Otis Redding - Sitting on the Dock of a Bay
Sammy Hagar - I Can't Drive 55 (more like 58!)
Steely Dan - Hey Nineteen
Steppenwolf - Born to be Wild
Waylon Jennings - Dukes of Hazzard Theme
And last but not least...
The Who - Magic Bus!

Yeah I know - a couple of those are early eighties - sue me. :-)

-David

150 songs on one CD... I love it!
