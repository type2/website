Subject: Re: [T2] Empi style 5 spokes for the Bays??

I've noticed those 5x112 5 spokes as well in Volksworld.  They also sell gas 
burners and fuchs in the 5x112 pattern over there as well.  Would be nice to 
just bolt on a set of wheels.  I find bay windows stop awsome with stock 
brakes in good condition so bolt on wheels are great.  Only option I see 
over here are 5x112mm BRM's that CIP sells.
