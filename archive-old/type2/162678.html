Subject: RE: [T2] Strange engine

Since you can run at cruise with no problems, I'd tend to rule out
electrical problems.

On my boat (with an ancient Atomic 4 and a Zenith Carb) I've had idle
problems. If I keep venturi pressure up, it will idle fine. But, once I
cut it by opening the choke, it will idle a bit and then die. I found the
idle system is totally clogged. So applying that logic here, it would
seem the idle system (whether it is jet or air) has a problem.

I assume you have a 34-pict-something carb.

Another thing to look at (and I should have said that first) is your fuel
pump flow. It may be fuel flow is not enough at idle. You use up what is
in the bowl, and that's it. Lots of rubber/plastic things in the fuel pump
that can go bad.

Please let me know what solves the problem, since that will help me and
others out!

Jon
