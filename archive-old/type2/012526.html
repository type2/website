Hi Bob,

I'm getting ready to try for better hot idle oil
pressure on my 80 Westy.  It starts and runs good, but
after a half hour at 55 mph in the summer, it only has
7.5 psi at idle.

From what I've learned so far, John Anderson (who also
gets fairly good HIOP), doesn't line bore his rebuilds
either, but he measures real carefully.  John has a
$500 line bore measurer for the case.  He pairs
measurements for the case main seat bores with the
crank main bearing surfaces and tries to get these
combinations to within 0.001 inch of spec and always
under the wear and out of round limits.  

So Bob, my question is, did you or Bruce do a lot of
measuring on your main bearing seats to make sure the
case was in spec, or did you somehow know it was a
great case?  What kind of bearings did Bruce used on
your T4?  From what I'm learning, to get even close to
30 psi hot idle oil pressure is pretty fantastic. 
Thanks.

Rob

&gt; &gt; Do you mean not see lower than 30 at hot idle? 
&gt; at VERY hot idle.
