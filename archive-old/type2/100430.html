&gt;Sorry, that is 35 lbs when the pressure regulator uncovers the outlet

&gt;on the injectors or cold start. Pressure very slowly leaked down &gt;to 40 and 
&gt;slower to 30 and seemed to stop, released plug to regulator &gt;and pressure

Yes,
It sounds like the regulator is leaking fuel directly into the intake 
manifold via the vacuum line. When the engine is shut down the fuel pressure 
is drained through this vacuum line into the intake manifold then leaks past 
the rings and into the engine.
