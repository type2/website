&gt; I just got a new to me, 1979 Bus.  Not much rust, doesn't run.

79 is a cool year. (i have one)

&gt; Previous owner says it lost all its oil one day, he didn't know why.  One
&gt; thing, though, there is no seal around the engine.  If the engine overheats,
&gt; will it purge the oil somehow?  I can't see any holes in the engine, and the
&gt; bottom of it isn't any more oilyer(?) than my 76 which runs fine.

purge the oil? i can't imagine how. If this guy wasn't smart enough to
assume that VW knew what they were doing w/ the engine seal I wouldn't
trust his diagnosis. You could try and drain the oil (if any) that's
in there now &amp; then fill it up again. disconnect the coil &amp; see if it
turns over &amp; any oil comes gushing from somewhere. I would start
there. If that worked great &amp; no problem, might want to try and see if
it starts.

If this guy ran the motor w/out oil for any length of time I imagine a
quick start to see if it runs wouldn't hurt it anymore than it is
already. good luck.
