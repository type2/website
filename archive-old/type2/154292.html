Subject: Unknown engine size

I knew I would need your help. My son's 78 westy has had an engine transplant.
I am not sure what was supposed to be in there or what is now in there.
the VIN from the door is 2382147141
I found a code on some of the duct it had a number on it: CB022377
what is this code?
The motor does NOT have a doghouse.
The Alternator is next to the crank pulley.
It uses an electric fuel pump.

Thanks,
Jim
