&gt;I'm sure I'm not the only rookie who would benefit from the list's general
&gt;advice about driving a bus on snow/ice--technique, best tires, other
&gt;considerations?  [I couldn't get through on the net to the Hoover sermons
&gt;before I sent this note; is there one on this?  Other net resources?

Hi!

Have you considered getting studded tires? 

I have 2 sets of wheels for Her Majesty - one set (of 4) are Cooper 
Weather Masters (sorta gnarly) snow tires that are mounted on chrome 
Porsche wheels. These are her highway/summer tires... it snows here 
every month of the year. These wheels and tires are so big that I 
couldn't chain them up if I wanted to - but the tires are aggressive 
enough for mild High Sierra snow storms... like less than 5 feet over 
night. When the weather turns really gnarly I change to ...

The other set (of 4) are Cooper Weather Masters that are studded... all 
four of them are studded - they are mounted on her original but 
re-worked VW wheels (painted mullberry magenta pearl, by the way). They 
are her full blown winter tires. They are WAY aggressive and I have 
NEVER had to chain her up. I live at 8,600 ft on a glacial lake and we 
are in the zone of highest snow deposition in the Eastern Sierra 
Nevada. She CRANKS with these tires! 

When we drive up to the ski area, we wave as we tick our way passed all 
the LAShuns who are marooned off the side of the road in their $40K 
Range Rovers!

:-)

Hope this helps!

P.S. Mark - my S.O. - has an extra set of rear wheels that he keeps 
chained up. He keeps them in the back of his '69 VW Squareback - and 
just jacks the car up when he needs to chain up - it works really well 
for him.
