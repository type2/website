Subject: Re: [T2] how to remove door linings ?

Slip a putty knife inward from the edge. If it bumps
into something, chances are it's one of the retainers.
Slide it sideways a bit and get right up against the
retainer, then twist the putty knife until the
retainer pops out of the hole in the steel door frame.
Be gentle and start at a point that isn't real obvious
- because they've been in there a long time and the
door panels are not very sturdy stuff - about like a
shipping carton of corrugated cardboard! After you get
about three in a row out, you'll be able to see what
they look like and all will make sense.

This should open to page 45 of their catalog. Scroll
to page 46 and at the top of that page are parts
FA202, FA204 &amp; FA201. They are similar to the clips
holding your door panels in place. The flat U-channel
on top holds the panel - there are holes in the panel
that provide edges for these clips to secure to. Wow -
tough one to explain! -BaH
