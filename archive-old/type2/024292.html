Subject: CAN YOU HELP ME???
Message-ID: &lt;7jq021$u1m8_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

I am looking for a type 2 bus. I don't know which year is better, and why. I have been told that if I want a camper van, that 74 on has a nicer kitchen, and the bunk is a double instead of a single... I'm looking at 71-82 vans...
When did the first water-cooled bus come?? 83?? If I were to purchase a camper van..which one is best?? How about a passenger van, again, which one would be best?? Also, if one were to hop up the engine with a few more &quot; wheaties&quot;..which displacement is best?? Will a Porsche 914 2.0L engine do well in it??

I know its subjective when you ask a general &quot; which one is best&quot; type question, but I need some history along with your opinions...

Thanks Mucho,
