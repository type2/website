I have a 71 bus that has a 009 dist. and a two barrel solex card. I was 
told that the two barrel carb is very hard to get set properly and can be 
bad for this type of engine. I have a 1776 engine. I am going to change the 
carb to a single barrel type and was wondering what would be the best. I 
was thinking of the solex 34 PICT-3. If I go to the 34 PICT-3
will I have to change it for the standard setting ( rejet/lean-rich settings).

thanks Mike
