hey all
        I've reached a heart wrenching decision. I'm selling my 71 westy.
I've moved to an urban area, thus it's a burden to keep him around.

-new carb
-new clutch and cable
-new heater boxers
-new muffler
-new rear brake pads, wheel cylinders
-new front discs, pads
-new master cylinder
-new tires rear, 6 ply
-new canvas w/ 3 zip windows
-cassette deck w/ speakers in door (have original AM/FM/Shortwave, it works)
-minimal rust

needs..
-paint (somewhat primered now)
-a good home with an enthusiast!!

 Interior in great shape, no cracks in dash, vinyl is ok, pop-top is solid,
just needs a scrub. I've invested somewhere around $4000 or so, I'm looking
for $2k, but I would like to sell before long, make me an offer. Van is in
