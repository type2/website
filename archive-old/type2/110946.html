Three AA batteries are better.  AAAs go pretty quick.
&quot;Sub codes&quot; are good if you want to limit conversation to only one other
radio.  When travelling with a group you will probably turn them off so
that you can hear everyone on the frequency.
&gt;
&gt; There's also an Audiovox FR1400 for $14.99 each that seems comparable. But you
&gt; can get the Uniden GMRS680-2CK for $47.99 that does both FRS and GMRS,
&gt; claiming a 5-mile range with built-in rechargeable battery. Decisions,
&gt; decisions...

GMRS requires a license (which most everyone ignores, but it's a $10K
fine)  You might get 5 miles across open country, but a mile or two is
more realistic.

I use $10 FRS radios for bus outings and they work well.  If I lose one,
no big deal.
