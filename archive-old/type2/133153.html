Subject: Re: [T2] Can my bus do this????????

Mike,

I used to tow bug's in my 67 bus with a 1641 type 1 engine in it many 
years ago....no problems whatsoever....just more stopping 
distance....ummm.but this was in west Texas where hills are few and far 
between.

I don't see that you would have a problem unless the bus is packed to 
the gills and you are going over the continental divide.

It really doesn't take much to tow a bug...might be good to have 
some gauges on the bus if you are going long distances.

My wife has a 67 bus and a 72 KG...although the bus is for sale on 
thesamba....isn't it nice when the spouse gets the &quot;bug&quot;....LOL!!!

Cheers, dave

&gt; You know the one, where you start buying air-cooled VW's...
&gt; 
&gt; Any way she has decided that she NEEDS to get a bug, and that we should pull
&gt; it behind Da'Bus on a tow bar when we go camping so we don't have to &quot;break
&gt; camp&quot; to run to town/where ever..
&gt; 
&gt; So my question: can a '78 with a T4 2.0 Liter motor pull '70s Bug???
&gt; 
&gt; Do I need to do modifications (external oil cooler, etc)?????
