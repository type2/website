&gt; Ya mean I could get 93 octane somewhere for my bus?
&gt; 
&gt; While in Canada this summer we found 2 Chevron stations that sold
&gt; straight  *94* octane.  My bus didn't get too much better gas mileage,
&gt; but boy, oh BOY did it run nice!  It's a '71 with a stock 1600 in it,
&gt; and with the load we were carrying, it needed all the help it could get!

It sure would be interesting to check cylinder head temperature
differences between these two fuels. I'd guess it to be a lot lower with
the 94.
