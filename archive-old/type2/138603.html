Subject: spare tire bumper things 

Howdy

I have a 71 Westy.
I checked where the spare tire goes and I have two screw holes where the 
tire might rest against the side of the van.
I checked after seeing a seller selling these on TheSamba.

http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=135985

I was wondering if my 71 should have these (he mentiones they are for a 77) 
or if something else
goes in those screw holes.

Thanks
Kevin
