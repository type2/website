Subject: Correct Duct Tape: (was  Breadloaf Safari Windshield)

Man, I wish I had a breadloaf so I could do this, especially when I saw
that this lovely example used the proper tape!  

When you breadloaf owners call the K-mart, make sure you get the correct
installation kit! Only buses with the chrome trim are supposed to use
the silver tape; Kombis, Panels and Campers should get the olive drab
color! ;-)
