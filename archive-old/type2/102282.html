Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel injectors

Thanks! I am especially concerned about the short hoses where they go onto
the injectors with the manufacturer's crimped endings. It doesn't look as if
there is a lot of area to get onto beyond the crimped sleeve. Everything
else has a hose clamp, and I'm not concerned about that. I only see one
cracked piece of hose now, but I'd feel better just to go ahead and replace
every bit of it every three years, all of it at one time.
