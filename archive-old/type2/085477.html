Subject: Re: [T2] Paint

Hi Shawn, 

In 1986 I painted my 72 westy with black tremclad using a brush and roller.
I added gold spray on the wiper arms and headlight rings, put a gold
pinstripe down the side just below the beltline and found some decent gold
plastic hubcaps.  It already had gold curtains and a  gold cover for the
nose-mounted spare. I wound up with a Campmobile John Players Special
edition, more or less. It looked terrific as a 20/20.

Fast forward to spring of 1997, when I acquired a very rusty 1973 westy.
It's typical of older vehicles in these parts... some places are fine, and
some places I find bondo 3 layers deep. I figure it maybe has 3 seasons left
in it so I pop-riveted fresh sheet-metal in place over the rockers and
doglegs, laid in a skin of bondo and headed to Canadian Tire for a gallon of
maroon Tremclad and a couple of those handy little 4&quot; rollers. It was a
great 20/20 job for 2 years, and it was into its 4th season on that paint
before I dissected it in 2000 to build my Westfakia.

I painted the Westfakia at Maaco for a couple of reasons; but mostly because
I didn't have time to do it myself and still attend Everybus last year. I
don't expect the Maaco paint to last forever, but for $200 it will last long
enough to allow me to save the $$$ to get it done better the next time,
maybe in two years or so.

Making the bus safe and reliable is important. Making it pretty is just an
ego thing. &lt;Flame suit fully engaged, fire when ready!&gt;

That's my experience, YMMV.

Happy trails,

&gt; Well said Hal.  I for one appreciate hearing that it's ok NOT to have a
&gt; pristine bus.  I have a friend who painted his Jimmy with Tremclad Black.  It
&gt; too passes the 20/20 rule.  Although I don't think I'd do it to my Westy, I've
&gt; often wondered about spray cans.  I guess it'd be pretty expensive in cans.
&gt; I'm in the middle of a very busy time career wise and I'd love to have the
&gt; time to devote to a full strip-down of the Westy and redo the body the way
&gt; I've seen some do on their Web Sites.  I'm amazed at how great they look.
&gt; I'd venture a guess that they are professional or are good friends with pros
&gt; and are in a situation that makes it a bit easier than most.  A situation they
&gt; undoubtedly made a conscious decision to set up. I consider myself lucky to
&gt; have a friend who has rebuilt a type 4 engine and I was able to part out his
&gt; old westy, engine included!  I gotta say that it's pretty cool to have someone
&gt; in my life who likes VW's as much as I do.
&gt; For the time being, I'll do the best I can with my ex-mechanic skills, repair
&gt; what needs repairing, prevent what I can and maybe, just maybe, I'll price out
&gt; cartons of rattle cans.  Can you get sage green???
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for listening...

&gt;&gt; I believe Napa makes a rattle can primer/sealer that should work well to
&gt;&gt; cover any exposed metal you may have.  The notion that you're better doing
&gt;&gt; nothing if you can't do it &quot;right&quot; is a bit presumptive.  Not everyone wants
&gt;&gt; a $10,000 bus that will only provide $2,000 in insurance coverage when you
&gt;&gt; total it.  I've got a bus that I painted in my driveway with spray cans. The
&gt;&gt; bus has lots of non stock modifications and various duct tape/bailing wire
&gt;&gt; fixes that work fine.  Plus it passes the 20/20 rule: It looks good from 20
&gt;&gt; feet away or at 20 mph.  I paid $800 for my bus and have put another $800
&gt;&gt; into it.  I can sell it for more than that in a pinch, and it does what I
&gt;&gt; want ... get me from point A to point B reliably in a vehicle that I enjoy
&gt;&gt; driving.  The people who want collectors cars won't get them painted at
&gt;&gt; Maaco, but for those of us who are saving to get the $199 paint job that will
&gt;&gt; last 5 years, shaker cans and Maaco are fine.  Plus ugly primer, rust, and
&gt;&gt; dents are good pasive insurance -- the Lexxus and the pristine 63 Splitty
&gt;&gt; will stay the hell out of your way -- they've certainly got more to lose.
