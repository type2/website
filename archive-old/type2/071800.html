&gt;  However if
&gt;  Boston Bob is such a great rebuilder, he ought to be
&gt;  able to guarantee at least 15 psi HIOP.  Instead, what
&gt;  will he guarantee?  Nothing.  Doesn't that make you
&gt;  wonder?
&gt;  
Maybe your asking the wrong question?  Maybe the question should be how much 
will it cost to have you guarantee such and such an oil pressure?
Further, he has no control over what happens to the engine after it leaves 
his shop.  Lots could go wrong that is beyond his control.  So maybe the 
question should be what do I need to do for you to guarantee such and such an 
oil pressure? 
I think the bottom line here is that he rebuilds engines to make a profit.  I 
don't know Boston Bob, the only time I have ever heard his name is on this 
list.  But, I know that if I rebuilt an engine, and I expected to make a 
profit on my work, I sure as hell wouldn't redo something that wasn't broken. 
 Or another way to put it is, If I guaranteed and engine for &quot;1 year or 
12,000 miles which ever came first&quot; and a customer wasn't satisfied with what 
I thought was an engine that would last at least that long, I wouldn't fix 
what I considered to be not broken.
One last thing.  The only way I've found to get guaranteed excellent work 
every time is to do it myself.  It seems nobody cares as much as I do about 
my stuff.
