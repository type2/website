Subject: RE: [T2] Clickety-Click CV Joint

The usual early failure noise for worn CV joints is loud, deep, clunking noises when going around a corner. I'd suggest a careful inspecxtion of your undercarriage and drive train, look for loose nuts &amp; bolts, etc. Make sure your CV boots are intact too.
