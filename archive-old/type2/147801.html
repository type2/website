&gt;&gt;I did have it a little easier than I could have -- some months ago I kludged a

&gt;The most recent SWF switches for our busses (at least the 74-79 ones) have the contact as well.

&lt;shrug&gt;  Didn't know that, but good to know.  My wiper switch self-destructed back in January,
it was raining, and I (as usual) was broke.  I had the Rabbit switches &amp; wiring from a car I'd helped
scrap out a few months earlier in a box in the garage.  So I made it work. :-)
