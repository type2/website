&gt;Here is a warning for all those with worn oily foam engine compartment
&gt;seals.Mine was pretty well non existent, but on a short trip last two weeks
&gt;ago I had a fellow pull-up behind me to let me know I had flames coming from
&gt;the back of my bus. I had just installed my gas heat so i feared the worst.
&gt;After I *&amp;(% my pant I open up the engine compartment to find that it was
&gt;the seal burning up. I guess a piece had fallen down onto either the heater
&gt;box or the muffler and the oily foam had caught fire.. No damage to anything
&gt;else but could have been worse.
&gt;So....If yours is getting kinda shbby looking REPLACE it.

     On the subject-when seals get ugly it's a good idea to replace 'em, 
period. After all, if your water pumper started leaking water you'd fix 
it before it overheated, right?  ;-) Of course, it is wintertime and only 
people in Texas are likely to overheat... 

(Yes, that was a slight poke at my former state of residence) :-P
