Subject: Re: under coating on cargo floor

One thing to note, and I was told this while preparing to do this
myself:

When it gets hot in the bus (like approaching 90 or so F) the undercoat
stuff - especially the rubberized stuff, tends to get all gummy, causing
things on top of it to slip and slide, and God forbid you get any on
your shoes or on the paint or track it around the bus...

Changed my mind.
