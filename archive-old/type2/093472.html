Subject: Fwd: 1991 Westy $$

Hope I don't get flamed for this......
If what I am doing is verboten (sp), please p-mail me to let me know.

My recent post attempt of the following message to the Wet Westy group bounced.
Could some dual subscriber out there please pass this on to that list ?

&gt;Subject: 1991 Westy $$
&gt;
&gt;Without knowing any more than just this basic statement.........
&gt;
&gt;1991 Westy in rust free condition, never subjected to salt, desert life,
&gt;Auto tranny, A/C, 76,000, electric windows, mirrors, cruise control ,
&gt;radio cassette, great shape inside and out.  A small ding  with body shop 
&gt;estimate to repair for $260.
&gt;
&gt;What are some min/max prices to expect when my friend puts her bus up for 
&gt;sale ?
&gt;Figured the group here would have a pretty deep knowledge on the $$$.
&gt;
&gt;Again, this bus has led a life in the desert free from rain and salt.
