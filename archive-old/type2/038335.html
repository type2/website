&gt; I am in the process of attempting to return my 82 FI Vanagon exhaust to its 
&gt; original appearance.  In a previous message problems with the MD state 
&gt; inspection were mentioned &amp; a need for parts. Luckily I was able to retrieve 
&gt; the crossover pipe &amp; catalytic converter form the previous owner!  
&gt; Unfortunately the elbow for the EGR valve had been cut &amp; welded closed by 
&gt; the first owner in the history of this VW.
&gt; 
&gt; So now to complete the EGR setup I need to make a connection from the nub 
&gt; left on the crossover pipe to the flange on the underside of the tin where 
&gt; the EGR filter used to be.  I do not have access to any type of welder, only 
&gt; propane &amp; solder.  A friend mentioned the possibility &amp; affordability of 
&gt; Silver Solder.  Could this be used to bind copper to steel?

I suspect that it would get too hot for silver solder, I have done a
pretty fair amount and I don't think it would hold long enough to get
through the emission inspection

personally I think that if you have to pass on welding that I would make a
&quot;Plumbing&quot; type of connection using mechanical components to lock things
together, it might not be pretty but it would work.  you can pick up a
&quot;pipe flanging&quot; tool at home depot for less than $20 and literally make a
copper pipe connection.  

later after passing the inspection if you wanted to save the pieces for
the next inspection you could make a bypass or &quot;dummy&quot; pipe to fit the
location and just tighten it into place
