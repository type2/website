Well our beloved listmaster's '73 with '78 GEX engine with recently replaced
AVP heads was about dead so this weekend we went with the intents of
stuffing a used 1700 I had in it using the FI he had previously
transplanted.  The following events brought to light some other interesting
things.

Steve is doing this as a stop gap solution till we install his Mark Stephens
(boy will they ever get bad press is this thing is a dud or unreliable)
Stage 2 in his just purchased '80 Vanagon (everyone harass him if he sells
his only Bus.)  But before we started with the 1700 which was in the 125k
range with 120, 110, 100, 90 type compressions I thought we'd have a look at
the just rebuilt but dead in one cylinder 2000 his van came with.  The
engine which had actually been &quot;professionally&quot; and I use that very loosely
rebuilt at 95k in the midwest, then again at 125k in FL, had new P&amp;C's
installed by the PO but showed about 120 in 1, 3, 4, with 5 psi or so in #2.
Steve had already pulled all the FI and tin off the '80 in situ (not smart
but hell he's been bored and twidling thumbs cause the MS engine is in a
shipping damage debate) so pulling the head was about a 5 minute task.
Immediately it became obvious that the intermittent whooshing and low
compression were due to the common bad luck mistake of not gluing the head
gasket in with grease on reassembly.  It had slipped down an inch and been
crushed wedging the thing apart.  At this moment I suggested the momentus
thought of using this block with the recently replaced heads on the engine
in the '73 (suffering P&amp;C problems) to end up with an essentially new
rebuilt 2.0 for the car as the bottom end had apparently been apart and
reassembled with new parts at least twice in its last 30k miles.  Many small
errors on both our parts ended up making this a truly monstrous undertaking
in 30F weather, but some immediate things leap to mind I would have the
installer know.  Wilson mentions some blurb about the breather (trivial) and
an oil filler drilling being the only differences.  Actually he means the
oil dipstick drilling, but that actually was not a big deal.  Some things
that are for potential converters.  Engine bearer mounting holes.  10mm on
the Vanagon case, 8mm on the Bus, a real annoyance when you've got to pull
the rear bumper bolts, cut them 1 inch shorter with a dremel tool, then
drill out the the Bus mount plates with a bit slightly too small because you
are borrowing the garage, don't have your tools or hardware assortment
present, and it's 9 pm on Sunday night.  The dipstick resolution is pretty
cool, we left the Vanagon stick in as well.  The real cool thing there is
that the '78 tin already has the cutout, it appears to me the 914 must have
used the same tin with a few added brackets, or perhaps did the 411/412.
Regardless the hole is present as a legacy, I had always wondered what it
was for, adjacent the thermostat cable hole, U shaped.  Steve now features
dual dipsticks, but is looking for another stick and tube for donation to
the '80, anyway the look is real neat, I like the location presented by the
Vanagon one better, it lines up perfectly and attaches as expected to the
fan shroud.  The last annoyance was on the flywheel end.  The flywheen in
particular, brand new on the Vanagon block, with brand new clutch, figured,
leave it on of course.  Put it together and engine is bound.  Take the
tranny back off (091 tranny out of a '78 with the 228mm clutch all its life
mind you) and obviously hitting the bellhousing.  What gives?  We don't
really know.  Now the '78 flywheels teeth were a bit worn for more clearance
on that side, but measuring from face of case to face of flywheel showed a
2mm difference.  We swapped the flywheels and clutches, but even then,
unless PERFECTLY aligned with the engine turning it seems for some reason
there is still apt to be binding.  I do not understand this at all.  Some
crude measurements (again tools not at hand) showed the face of the crank
the same distance below the face of the case on both blocks.  End play on
both seemed slightly excessive (again no tools) but about even all in all.
I'd be interested if anyone else has noticed this sort of thing.  Something
on that end about the machining of the actual Vanagon case or something was
causing us confusion.  Anyway, with it all in, things seem to have worked
out.  Like I said some other issues got us, like having to swap in all the
damn cylinder shims because I felt the .035 to 0.040 deck height the Vanagon
block was showing wasn't exactly wise even with the AVP heads so had to pull
all the P&amp;C's as units to leave the rings in position, but hey nothing new
to working on wasserleakers.  And then the cranking compressions have ended
up lowish though even but in the end Steve thinks it has &quot;way more power&quot; so
things ended up well enough.

I'm actually also seeking opinions about the reverse conversion as I want to
build an engine for my '81 on the 1700 block and I'm looking for pitfalls
excepting those I've mentioned and the obvious blocking of the fuel pump
mount.
