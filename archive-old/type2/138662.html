Subject: We Made it!

Hi Volks,

Well the family, el Verde and I made the long trip to Texas. No problems, 
lots and lots of white knuckle driving but we are now unloaded and el Verde 
is now resting in her new garage. Safe and Sound. Thanks to all for thier 
help and advice. Espesicially Rob Henley and John Baird for helping to 
lighten the load. I hope you guys make out well with the parts.

See you all soon. I will be responding as I can my internet service will not 
be up for a while. I am now using a borrowed computer and service until I 
get fully unpacked and set.

Thanks again,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, &quot;el Verde&quot;
