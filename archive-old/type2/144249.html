Subject: Re: [T2] Steering box seals?

I had the same problem on my 78 T2.  But instead of
fooling around with the seal, I replaced the steering
gear with a new TRW brand from Brazil.  About $200,
and haven't had a stich of problems with it.  Fit
perfectly without modification.  www2.cip1_dot_com for
part# VWC-211-415-049-H.  And when you replace the
steering gear, you should also replace the rubber
coupler VWC-211-415-417 _at_ $20, as your current one is
probably both original, and worn out.   A cadillac
solution at a signifant cost.   To keep costs low
though, I'm sure you could find a the correct seal.
   
During the repair, our #1 problem was unseating the
drop arm from the original steering gear.  That took
several attempts, PB Blaster, and a torch to
accommplish.

&gt; Hello list. On my 78 westy the only oil leak I have
&gt; is
&gt; from my steering box. Does anyone know of a source
&gt; to
&gt; get new seals for a steering box? Mainly I need the
&gt; one for the peg shaft oil seal. In the bentley
&gt; manual
&gt; Sec. 2, Page 31, Fig. 9-18, Item #20.
