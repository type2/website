Tommy, 

I have, I have :-)  Actually, I must admit to being him on one
occasion early in my career owning a Vanagon...  Took it to a shop and had
some work done on the rear brakes.  Now the Vanagon has self-adjusting
rears, so the mechanic slapped the drum back on and let it go.  Imagine my
surprise! I stopped (barely), called and complained, then went under it to
adjust them... no adjustment holes!  then I remembered...  hit the brakes
in reverse a time or two, and all was well.  I still wish he had done a
bit more initial adjusting, but it was &quot;no blood, no foul&quot;.

Everyone else,

In case you are wondering... I wrote Tommy privately about adjustment.
My procedure and his differ.  He goes for a fairly tight adjustment, which
gives a high pedal immediately.  Mine is a bit looser initially, but I
think it is kinder to the shoes/drums. Either will work, tho if you like
your brakes high and hard, his is the way to go.  I include a copy of my
procedure below for information.

=======================My P-mail to Tommy===============================

Tommy,

Right on!!!  Great post!  I vary from your procedure in that I
treat bleeding and adjustment as different procedures.  I don't know that
my way is better or worse, just different.  Let me know what you think...

Procedure 1: Bleed the brakes:

1a adjust the shoes hard against the drums (until the wheel turns with
some  difficulty) on all shoes;

1b bleed brakes, start with cylinder furthest from the M.C.

Procedure 2: Adjust the brakes:

2a back the the adjusters to take the shoes off *all the way*; 

2b turn each adjuster on a wheel, 5 clicks at a time (OK, 10 or 15 at
the beginning) until you get a whisper;

2c at that point, I do something I was taught that I have never heard from
anyone else...  I do something called &quot;centering the brakes&quot;.  Get in and
pump the brakes 5-6 times. then go out and check the wheel again.  Adjust
one click at a time on both adjusters 'til you get a whisper again. Repeat
this step 'til the pumping does not relieve the whisper, and back the
adjuster off one notch. I usually go thru the centering procedure about
3-4 times before I am happy.
