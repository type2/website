&gt; Subject: re: low oil pressure at low speeds
&gt; 
&gt; Said Al Brase:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm with Clara that an oil pressure gauge would be nice, but the ideal
&gt; &gt; &quot;baling wire&quot; fix is 20w-50 oil. I've even used 60-70 Harley oil in a
&gt; &gt; worn out American truck.
&gt; 
	[Crick, Bill ]  Not that I'm saying do this, but my brother had an
	old half ton that leaked/burned more oil than gas. Sort of like
	fill it up, and check the gas. He burned used oil from the garage 
	he worked at. He finally put 2 quarts of 'differential oil - Hypoid
lube - 
	Rear end dope' That truck didn't use a drop of oil for about 5000
miles.
	Then it suddenly went CLUNK! and that was the end of the story;-)

	People do some strange things to ve-hicles up north, way back in the
bush;-0
