Erich --

Please realize that you are not allowed to use any tools bearing VW part
numbers unless you also wear a crisp lab coat like the fellas shown in the
factory manuals.  :-)

&gt; Hi All!
&gt;
&gt; I have been a lurker for several days now and have waited for Friday to =
&gt; post this question.  I'm looking at buying a big stash of tools from the =
&gt; estate of a deceased VW mechanic.  Most of the tools I don't recognize =
&gt; but they all have VW part numbers.  Can anyone point me to a source for =
&gt; a book or website that lists what these tools are?
