&gt; Cheapo &quot;wrench&quot; for removing rear axle nut.  The 1/2&quot; hole is for your
breaker bar...

That's what the man told me, but I'd forgotten by the time that we got back
to the house.

&gt; Distributor drive gear puller, but it is broken.

Too bad.  Maybe I'll find another for replacing the broken bit.

&gt; .............um, no, Foolish Caster.  This tool is for turning the clutch
cable wingnut.

I'm in tears on the floor!  The fellow couldn't remember what it was for,
but I know that I'll make good use of it now.

Thanks, Rik.
