Subject: Re:  Wheel bearing from hell

 Hello listers,
    This is my first post requesting mechanical info,, 
     I am attempting to replace the rear wheel bearing on my '66 Westy
     I have so far only succeeded in pulling the outer race and then the cage
with 
     all the roller bearings out,,, I am left with the inner race stuck on
the axle,,,
      I have tried vice grips, various pry bars, etc,  but cannot get it
off,, I haven't found     
      a puller that will fit,, does anyone make one?  The picture in the
Bentley manual  
      shows VW 241 being used,, I couldn't fine anything like this at our
local tool 
       shop.   I have tried heating it with a propane torch but no go.... any
ideas???
        TIA    Pink Newell
