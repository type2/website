Subject: RE: [T2] Homeland Security Chief Warns of Bus-bomb Threat

I'd call a travel agent.  No seriously, I'm amazed at the number  of Canadians who drive busses, probably the worst of vehicles to drive  in a cold climate.  Mine works ok with my propane heater during  the winter.  But winters in the south are nothing compared to what  you guys endure.  And that's inspiring! 
  
  Sign me up for the crosswind class.  Or maybe I could teach it.  Cheers....KR

We are having some 'how to maintain your VW workshops and how to
drive a VW bus in a crosswind class.  We have all of a sudden been
overrun with requests for more workshops by several non-vw-speaking
people.  What was a 4 person workshop has become a 40+ person
class with 2 more workshops scheduled this month.

Who should I call?
