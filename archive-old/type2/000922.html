I was rereading about the sound deading material and I was wondering
If anyone had a good alternative to the expensive sound deading pads
My van isn't worth investment for the padding.  The Kool patch is
inexpensive enough
to be worthwhile but does anyone have a good idea what to put underneath
that is less expensive then the sound deading pad

Thanks
Joe Davis
