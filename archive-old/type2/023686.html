Hi all,

How hard is it to change out an alternator on a '77 Bus???

My Bus (freshly back from the shop by the way) will not start. The
battery is dead as a door-nail. So, we jump the Bus off and then do a
quick test of the alternator by disconnecting the battery cable. Bus
dies right then.

Also, if anyone has a working alternator for a '77, e-mail me with
price.
