Subject: Re: [T2] SVDA and Kadrons

I would also like to point out that BD's are OEM (not german, re-read the
description), ours are german at that price, that's why they cost so much.
This is NOT A SLAM on BD, they are an asset to the hobby.

If it's that important to you I'll get a price on the OE ones and put them in
our catalog, but we sell so few it's not worth my time, I have a zillion other
more pressing issues to deal with.
