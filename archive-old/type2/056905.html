Subject: spark plug wires and cold starting

Hi

Got my new wires yesterday, put them in, and I still get an orange spark
to the fan housing...damn curse...

I measured the resistance of all the spark plug wires I could find,
here's
what I got:

bosch wire from my brother's bug - 3k
JC whitney wire from my bus - 600
new BWC wire - 4k
wire from tractor - 5

I get an orange spark from all the wires except the one from the
tractor, that one gives a blue spark

but when I pulled the wire to #1 and held it so I could see the
spark between it and the cap, it looked like it had sort of a purplish
glow to it- like it wanted to be blue but couldn't...

Today I did a compression test, 125+ on all cylinders! never will I
doubt the greatness that is the type 4 engine.

Is the orange spark ok as long as it is big? it's a fat spark, but it's
orange... The bus wouldn't start last winter when it was cold, even with
it cranking really fast... The cold start valve is working, but I did
have a leak from the brake servo before that made it idle rough... could
that have caused it to not start? It really would be nice if I didn't
have to jump start it in below zero weather when I need to get to
school...
