&gt; From: Harmon Seaver &lt;hseaver_at_harmon.bml_dot_usouthal_dot_edu&gt;
&gt;      Having lived in my van for over a month straight now, 

Good to hear from other people who dare to break away from
the conventional suburban/ condo or whatever living. I don't
hear nearly enought of these stories so I hope this post can
stimulate some more discussion.

Living in the bus while doing something more serious than just
vacationing (like going to school or working) is a challenge
both in adjusting your own ways and dealing with societys reactions.
Most people don't think it is possible, and are even more baffled
that someone might even want to do it and enjoys it.

A few years ago my girlfriend and I lived 2 months in the bus.
During that time we attended 3 conferences (original excuse to
have the plan accepted), wrote a research paper, using email
do communicate with co-authors, occasionally abandoned the
but to go sailing and camping in the Everglades and Fla keys
(not the stinky commercial Fla keys, the uninhabited ones
away from Rte 1)

The alternative 2mo would have been in front of the computer 
in my office. Hard to choose?

(Still not convinced, check the places and adventures links on
my WWW page)

&gt; I quickly
&gt; discovered that a major drawback to the VW Westy as a long-term camper
&gt; is space -- not nearly enough. Even though it's just me and my cat, a
&gt; lengthy stay requires one heck of a lot of stuff. And I'm constantly
&gt; wishing I had stuff I left at home, and at the same time constantly
&gt; bitching about having way too much stuff -- there's no place to put it

Like so many others we made the &quot;too much stuff&quot; mistake also. It's
a pain to have to move stuff around all the time just to make room.
The real solution is an adjustment of mind. It's surprising how few
things are needed for comfortable living in the VW bus once one
has broken loose from the illusion things = safety, comfort etc
that a lifetime of advertizing has pounded into us. 

In later trips I've simply started from a basic backpacking set
of items and for bus life added sparingly to it instead of trying
to trim down on a typical house/apt set of daily items.
