Subject: &quot;Our&quot;? Car Compnay 

This is a story out from the Detroit Free Press
and i Quote--
&quot;Ford has decided to manufacture the Model T again as part of a promotion tied to the
company's
centennial celebration in 2003. It's the 1st time Ford workers have turned out Model T's
since
1927.
Ford is making only 6 of these legendary cars, and even though the project has been
hush-hush
rumors of the Model T reincarnation have touched off massive interest in the antique -car
circles and speculation that the company will make more and sell them to the public.&quot;

Again do you think there is something &quot;Our&quot; car company can learn from this? Something
like
good PR?
hopefully, uj

PS: This is just a small part of a full half page story in the Phoenix paper with photos
of the
&quot;New&quot; Model T
