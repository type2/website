&gt;&gt;A friend of mine has a 54 Deluxe that is very complete and has been 
&gt;in a

&gt;&gt;located  in the left and right floor area in the front and there is a

&gt;
&gt;Well, I know one guy who bought a somewhat decent '55 deluxe, but 
&gt;needing
&gt;some bodywork and interior, for $9500.  
&gt;
&gt;I know another fool who bought a really, really, REALLY, rusty '54 
&gt;deluxe
&gt;for $7000.  I also know of someone who just sold a really nice '53 
&gt;deluxe
&gt;for $25k.
&gt;
&gt;The most important question here is: does he know what he has?  Is he 
&gt;even
&gt;remotely aware of its value?  What area in the country are ya?  Ya 
&gt;might get
&gt;away with $2000-$2500 or so, if he hasn't been exposed to the hype.  
&gt;There
&gt;was a time when you couldn't _give_ barndoors away...
&gt; - -  - -
&gt;it is all relative.   does he have an idea what he wants?    how much 
&gt;do you
&gt;have available to spend on it?    how good a friend is he?   don't 
&gt;forget,
&gt;it'll cost a bit to fix it up.  
&gt;   a guy i met was *given*  a very nice flat sided gated 53 single cab 
&gt;last
&gt;year.  been sitting in a farmers field in Alberta (dry) for years.   
&gt;(the
&gt;truck, not the guy)
&gt;
&gt;Oh, and when you say &quot;complete&quot; - does it have the vent trim?

Missing 3

  Correct
&gt;middle seat with 6, not 4, legs?  Radio (swoon!)?
&gt;- - -
&gt;how about - correct bumpers with trim, panel that clips on to middle 
&gt;seat,
&gt;  keys,  wiring original? semaphores? steering in good shape?  horn 
&gt;button?
&gt; floor mats? 
&gt;
Yes to all of the above.
&gt;sounds great- hope you get it, and i bet thom is drooling.    :),
