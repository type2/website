Subject: 1600DP Rebuild Problem Found and Fixed.

Yeah, this one's long, too.  Sorry; I have this way of throwing words at
the wall to see if any stick and make a stain.  Hey, at least I'm not
complaining this time.  :)


The explanation of what the whole problem was is at the bottom, if you're
impatient.  &lt;:)  


It's been 14 months since May 15th, 1997, when I pulled the engine on my
'68 bus, hoping to find the reason why the green light was flickering at
idle.  Hoo boy, I found out.  

It took maybe 2 weeks to disassemble the engine (first time ever looking at
a VW engine from the outside of the compartment, be charitable), then 3-4
months to shop, assemble, raise money, assemble, raise money, assemble,
raise money... you get the idea.  

I had to put it down for the school year; I work as a network adminstrator,
*and* I'm a full-time art student.  That schedule leaves maybe 2 hours a
day for sleep, and none for mechanical work.  And that's on the weekend. 
:)  Besides, have you *seen* the prices on art supplies, clay, and photo
equipment?  

Anyhow, I picked the thing back up in May, ran into trouble... I won't get
into the story now.  I've talked about it before.

St. Muir says, to paraphrase:  This rebuild will take us about 3 days.  One
for disassembly, one for buying parts and having machine-work done, one to
put it all back together.  It'll take you a bit longer.  

Yeah.

St. Muir wrote them words, probably around 1969.  Maybe like '73 or so. 
You could get all the parts at Volkswagen.  Your local machine shop still
had the right equipment to align-bore the case.  The parts were *made* by
Volkswagen.  They fit together, even.  VW mechanics knew one side of the
engine from the other, and didn't learn it from their grandfather.  
 
It's 1998.  The youngest aircooled engine you'll find in America is like 15
years old.  And that's a Vanagon.  The youngest *upright* engine for a
transporter is 27 years old.  And VWoA doesn't want to talk to you.  Local
machine shops stare and laugh when you say the words &quot;aircooled
Volkswagen.&quot;  (They do in New England, anyhow... they salt the roads around
here like McVomit french fries.)    And we probably don't want to know who
makes the parts we buy.  The parts don't fit together --30 years of heat
warpage, or loose tolerances, or just plain crappy manufacturing... it adds
up to work-hours spent filing, bending, adjusting, tuning.  And VW
mechanics... most of them haven't seen a VW older than a Fox.  Maybe an
early Golf.  

We are living in a different world from John Muir; a more hostile one to
our beloved machines.  It takes longer to track down good parts, it takes
longer to make them all fit right, it takes longer to have machine-work
done.  It takes longer.  Period.  

And that's if you do everything *right*.  

Which I didn't.  

I just spent about 3 months trying to start this engine.  The one that I
spent 4 months putting together.  Through incorrect end-play settings,
through bad parts, through double- and -triple and -quadruple checking of
everything... the thing Would Not Start.  

Finally, it was turning over just a bit, but coughing badly and spewing
smoke out the air-cleaner.  My grandfather, a very good mechanic (when it
comes to old American cars) suggested that the intake valves were sticking,
because the engine sat through a long NE winter.  Y'all saw that post, I
won't repeat it.  


That was the last time I posted to the list; a lot has happened since then.
 

After several attempts to fix the problem in-car, I grunted, thumped my
chest a few times, yanked the engine out the back of the bus, carried it
over to the workbench, and pulled bits and pieces off it until the heads
fell off.  Then I ate a banana and scratched my head, because the valves
were *fine*.  Not stuck at all.  Huh.

I asked fellow listee Ron Van Ness to take a look at the engine to see if I
was hallucinating; he confirmed that the valves were not stuck (but I was
hallucinating anyway.  Crazy people do that.  ;).  And, as he pointed out,
the valve-guides aren't steel (unlike in an old Ford or Chevy), and
wouldn't rust during the winter.  D'oh.  

We put the engine back together, fixing a slight problem caused by ...guess
what?... parts that were having trouble fitting together.  And then learned
one of the Major Rules of Type2 Engine Installation:  

	Thou Shalt Not Install Thy Engine Whilst Thy Axles Art Not Attached.  For
Thy Transmission Shalt Swing From Side To Side, And Thy Drive-Shaft Shalt
Hang Up And Screw Up Thy Engine Installation, And Thou Shalt Get Very
Pissed Off.  

(I was in the middle of a CV job when I decided to pull the engine and
check the heads; next time, I'll put the axles on before I put the engine
in.)

Installing an engine with the axles off now ranks up there on my list of
Things Not To Do...  just above inhaling mosquitos, and below putting
hamsters in the microwave.  

Anyway.

I had an appointment this Monday with D&amp;D Auto, a local VW-only shop (that
I recommend to anyone in the CT area without reservation... but make an
appointment, because they're *busy*), and had the bus towed down there.  

It took them an hour and a half to find the problem.  Total.  

The problem was, er... 

I'm embarassed to say this.

The cam was improperly installed.

[sound of forehead striking keyboard]

When I first gave the keys over to D&amp;D, my parting words were &quot;with my
luck, the cam is installed wrong.  Ha ha.&quot;  

D'oh!

So, I collected my bus from D&amp;D, had it towed back here.  Now, I had just
spent 14 *months* building, waiting, troubleshooting, and trying to start
this engine, and I had to tear it apart to fix the camshaft.  Split the
case.  If I thought about it, I'd be paralyzed.  

So as soon as I got the bus home --and I do mean 'as soon'-- I pulled the
engine, and tore it down.  All the way.  Started at 3 in the afternoon,
split the case at about 11:30PM.  And the timing dot on the cam gear was
indeed several teeth away from the two timing dots on the crankshaft gear. 


Ahhhh.  At *LAST*... I found a problem.  There is nothing ...and I do mean
absolutely and completely *nothing*... more irritating than troubleshooting
and not finding a clear problem.  The last 3 months were very trying for
me.  &lt;:)  

I took pictures.  Cam improperly installed, and then --after I fixed it--
properly installed.  Close-up on the dots.  Different angles, just in case.
 Now, I have concrete physical evidence that the cam was put in the right
way, so I don't mistrust my memory later.  

That's important; get *evidence*.  Write things *down*.  Take pictures.  

Anyhow.

That night, I did a quick preassembly to check the cam-lifter operation and
such, then mated the case (did a better job this time, too), assembled the
engine up to the cylinders and finger-tightened the heads.  

Then the sun came up.  Time to go hang by my toes in my cave.  Eek eek.  

Next day, (well, later on the same day)  I borrowed a seal-installation
tool from Ron Van Ness, and finished the engine assembly.  

Time taken:  9 hours disassembly, 2 hours preassembly, 14 hours assembly. 
2 days total.  

Let's compare that to the first time...

Time taken:  2 weeks disassembly, 4 months assembly.  

Who says twits like me can't learn something?  :)  

I haven't installed the engine yet (I'm finishing up my CV job, putting on
the axles first.  I try not to repeat mistakes.  &lt;:)), but I should put it
in tomorrow.  I don't foresee any more problems; I checked everything over
at every step of the assembly, and couldn't find anything wrong.  I
*wanted* to find something wrong, just so I could fix it.  I never said I
wasn't neurotic.  

The engine *almost* started with the cam installed 20 degrees off.  

So... I can heave a sigh of relief.  Premature, maybe.  But relief
nonetheless.  And I couldn't have done it without Das Bulli List.  Bob
Hoover gave me some very good input on checking the cam to make sure the
cam gear was right; Ron Van Ness helped out in innumerable ways; Ken Hooper
told me to just pull the freaking engine already --and he was right; many
others gave me advice on ways of fixing stuck valves, checking timing,
making sure I didn't fry my bearings with excess cranking.  

In any case, does this message have a point?  Yes.  The point is:  If you
discover a problem, Fix It Right Then.  Especially if it's a big problem
that involves a lot of work to fix.  If you stop and think about it, you'll
get overwhelmed.  If I'd stopped and thought about redoing all the work of
the last year, I wouldn't have done it.  But I didn't, and so I did.  You
kind of have to be insane to get things done, sometimes.  ;)  

That's the first point.  The second point is:  If you're going to do your
first rebuild... find a spare engine.  Seriously.  I wish I had.  And if
your engine is okay-ish but heading for rebuild time, rebuild the spare. 
Then swap.  Or build from scratch and swap.  But don't pull the engine and
let the bus sit for over a year like I did.  When you've got a nice, new,
reliable rebuilt engine purring (or clackety-ing, whichever) in your bus,
you can sell the spare... or keep it, whatever.  Take it along as a spare
for a road trip, and your engine will *never* break down.  ;)  (Didn't you
know?  Spares that you carry will never be used.  They appease the VW
Gods.)  

100,000 miles down the road or so, when it comes rebuild time, I will
probably already have a rebuilt engine waiting to swap with this one.  Or a
generally-okay engine to push me to the FLAPS and work and back while I
rebuild this one.   

I try not to repeat mistakes.  &lt;:)

That's all.  I'm going to go hang by my toes for a while.  

Eek Eek.
