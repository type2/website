Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt 2.0 FI - worst case scenario

Thanks Dave. I don't have the timing info, just duration and lift - not
timing.  Does anyone on the list have this for a Webcam 107i?  Does
anyone have this for the stock cam?  I could do this on mine and see if
it resembles stock as far as timing goes.

&gt; No shop rags left in the intake anywhere?
    Nope

&gt; S tube securely connected at both ends?...
   Triple checked and resealed

&gt; Sounds to me like the engine is &quot;seeing&quot; lots of air and not much
&gt; gas...which means that the afm is not seeing all of the air flow and not
&gt; adjusting the injector timing accordingly, untill you get hi rpms.
   Same thought I had (and others suggested) after discounting it as
ignition timing, so I took off any extra bits and sealed holes with
rubber stoppers - so I am very sure no extra air is getting in past the
AFM. Also checked by flowing propane around potential openings (while
trying to get it to run steady)

&gt; You never did say whether it was smelling rich at 2000 or not...
    It is , but it runs very very roughly until 5K!  If extra air was
getting in past the AFM it would be lean, no?
