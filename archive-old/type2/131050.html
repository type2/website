Subject: Re: [T2] What is on that wheel?

Those are for putting dualies on. bolt right on and through. Notice the 
fenders are cut up a bit? That way it won't rub on the dualies. Makes tiring 
replacement even more expensive ;)

****
Wheel reinforcement rings???


I'm glad someone else saw that!   I was wondering what the hey those bolts
are for too???
