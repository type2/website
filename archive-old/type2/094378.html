&gt; I just installed a tach in the clock cavity ............
&gt; without removing the dash faceplate !!

See you at the Chiropractors!

&gt; It was a bear of a job !!
&gt; 
&gt; Beer, patience, magic words, and the help of my cousin !

A word to the curious or adventurous: be sure to disconnect the battery
before doing anything behind the dash. The risk of burning everything down
is too great. I forgot once and the seeing all that smoke almost stopped my
heart.  Luckily I noticed in time and didn't have to pay for the mistake.

This has been a type2 public service announcement. '-)
