Subject: Re: [T2] Grinding into second gear.

after reading the email I wrote, I thought would probably be nice of me
to just explain it instead of telling you to buy a book..

So, I pulled out the bentley, but after reading the section, I don't
think I can explain it without being really confusing :)  

Anyone else out there have a good description of how to adjust the stick
shift and the stop plate?

but yes, if you haven't already gotten it, go buy the bentley.  It'll
save you alot of time and grief.

Mike

p.s. I should've just kept my mouth shut and kept on reading...
hmmmmmmmmmm. &lt;G&gt;

&gt; &gt; I have a 77' Bus, I just got it and its the first car I've actually worked on
&gt; &gt; a lot.  I learned to drive a stick on it and I took it to a body shop to put
&gt; &gt; a new floor in, they had to disconnect the steering, stick, and pedals from
&gt; &gt; the floor.  When they put it back in second gear grinded really bad and third
&gt; &gt; gear was up a lot further, I had to take off my shift knob so the stick could
&gt; &gt; fit under the dash and pop into third gear.  Any help would be greatly
&gt; &gt; appriciated.
