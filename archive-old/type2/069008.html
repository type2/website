Subject: Tool FAQ, 12 point star, torx

        Volks,
        Steve's tool FAQ lists:
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    torx-head -- if this is a 12 sided thing then a 6mm on has been 
suggested for cv work.  [Can someone else verify?]
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        I think list consensus is that 6mm Allen works on Allen Head
CV bolts and 8mm 12-point star works on 12-point Star CV bolts. TORX
is something else- 6 point stars, yes? 
        
        I used to own a Golf II that had TORX-head bolts holding
the front brake calipers. Possibly other 80s VWs are similarly set-up.

        I've seen TORX and Allen head drivers set-up as 3/8&quot; socket
tools, as power-screwdriver bits, as straight tools with screw-driver
handles and T-handled Allen drivers (Plastic T AND bent hex-stock).

        I've got a 'folding pocket-knife' style set of TORX drivers with
a chromed sheet-steel handle. Similar Allen key sets are available and 
I've got one of those too.

        I've seen 12-point star tools that were 3/8&quot; socket tools AND
seen just a chunk of machined hex stock (I guess you add your own
10 or 12mm socket if you're smart... I tried using it with the
correct open-end-wrench and couldn't make much progress. Like I said,
I've made every mistake I could think of!)

        For normal work around your VW, the Allen, TORX or 12 point star
tool set up for 3/8&quot; socket are a good addition to the usual little
bag of bent-bar-stock Allen keys. The 'pocket knife' style is more 
convenient to carry but can't be torqued as much. Which might be a good
thing.

        The 17mm for the tranny drain plug is much nicer as a 3/8&quot; socket
tool on an 18&quot; flex handle than the 2 lb bent-stock version with a water 
pipe over one end. IMHO.
