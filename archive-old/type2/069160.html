Subject: leaky rear wheel - 67 westy

check the rear spindle nut and make sure it is tight and that the 
cotter pin is still intack.  &quot;Honey&quot; was making the same noice last 
year and I found that the brake people did not do their job.  It 
started as a thumping noise and when I finally determined what was 
causing it the outer cv joint grease was all over the inside of my 
tire.  Hope this helps.
