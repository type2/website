I checked these tires out today.  Website didn't
list the load rating so I eyeballed them myself
at the store.  (I had to insist that the tire
teck let me see tire and read the sidewall
myself.)  Load index is 98 and 1695.  I forget
the max pressure but it was appropriate.  Price
is $45.00 + $9 for lifetime road hazard, stems
etc.  Worth a look for those of us looking for an
all terrain tread or not willing to put $150 per
tire for agilis.
