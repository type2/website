Subject: '79 Bus won't stay running all the sudden

Hi Gang,

I have a '79 Bus with the stock 2.0L fuel injected flat four.  I had the
bus stored all winter, and it fired right up when I went to move it last
week.  I started it again today, and it ran great for a few minutes.
After idling for some time, I revved the motor.  Sounded great, but when
she returned to idle, the idle kept getting slower and slower until she
stalled.  It would start back up but only run for a few seconds and
stall.  Then it wouldn't start at all, just continue turning over.  

If I wait a few hours and crank it over, it will fire up and run for a
short time (a minute or less) and then stall.  It sounds like a fuel
starvation issue.  Has anyone experienced a similar issue, and can you
provide a good place to start the diagnosis?

I tried searching the archives, and will continue to, but thought I'd
drop an email to the list at the same time.  Thanks in advance for any
help.

-Ross
