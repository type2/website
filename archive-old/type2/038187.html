Subject: Eager to Tour

It was written:

&gt;I really don't care anything about this...  I suspect most
everyone that
&gt;had an interest in it has lost interest, hence the lack of
momentum behind
&gt;it...

And objected:
&gt; I object.  My rusty but trusy Westy is all a-purr, ready
to take up the
&gt; baton (er...hubcap).  Michigan is ready and waiting,
captain.

Allow me to second that objection... I've got nothing
mechanical on my mind these days, so I've been scanning the
list hoping for word of the tour. We're all ready to go
waaaaay out in Washington State, on the Olympic Peninsula...
Upper Left Hand Corner of the Nation is READY!
