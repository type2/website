&gt;     In the quest to solve my rough idle, short of putting a rivet in the

&gt; way. (makes sense to me) On my bus I can blow through both ways with one way
&gt; a little more restrictive. Does any one recall these little animals?? Should
&gt; I just replace the thing??
&gt;

they are vacuum valves, try sucking on the valve rather than blowing
