The cam and lifters must be matched! Used lifters and a new cam, or vice
versa will be shortlived..

&gt; Neil:
&gt; You need to split the case if you're changing the cam.
&gt; It depends what cam you have in there now. If it's the stock 74-75 cam,
it's
&gt; already for solids anyway. If it's a 78 or later hydraulic cam, you'll
need to
&gt; change to a cam designed for solids. BTW, if going this far and what you
want
&gt; is more power consider getting the cam used in early 1700's and Porsches.
&gt; Basically it's a little more duration and lift.
&gt; This cam change was the only difference between the two engines used in 73
in
&gt; the automatics and the stick cars. The horsepower was 62 and 66 hp
&gt; respectively. It would probably be worth about the same increase on an
1800
&gt; engine.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   I'm just wondering if it is possible to switch back now without
breaking
&gt; &gt; open the case. I guess I'll just be pulling out the hydraulic lifters
and
&gt; &gt; putting in regular ones,right? Anything else I need to do?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
