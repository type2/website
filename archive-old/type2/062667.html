Subject: Re: Need Some Options on Carbs

i'm tired of the single weber carb on my '74 1800cc bus. didn't the 74  
have dual carbs as stock? i believe mine was changed by a FPO. i'm not  
gettinggood gas milage (16-18mpg) on an rebuilt engine with about 800  
miles. i know i'm not gonna get great milage on the rebuild...but what  
should i expect?

Yup,

For sure 73, 74, dual carbs were stock, 72 maybe I'm not sure.

I have a stock 74, twin solex, been checking around for a pair

to rebuld, apparently rare as &quot;hens teeth&quot;.  Are you sure you

want to go down this path?  Two carbs are a pain to keep tuned,

synching, idle adjustment, jetting, etc.  One carb sounds like

the cats meow to me.  I am not sure you are far from the best

mileage anyway, heard 20, 22 is the max.  Have you thought of

one of those high-tech gadgets like a Jacobs Ignition setup, you

might get the extra 2 mpg that way and spend about the same amount.
