&gt; I recently put what I thought was a 1974 1800 bus engine into my 1972
&gt; camper. Why I never noticed, but I didnt, but the oil filler is not in
&gt; the usual place. It is on top of the block just above the alternator.
&gt; Does anyone know why the filler is there? Is it from a type III?


Most likely from a Type 4 (411 or 412). A Type 3 would have had a 1600
&quot;beetle&quot; engine.
