&gt;you know it's funny, that is pretty much exactly what my wife said when we

You guys seem to be assuming that every conversion will be super-fugly.  It 
doesn't have to be that way.
I have given a lot of thought to an engine conversion for my bus and I may 
end up doing it someday.  If I do, it will be a well-engineered conversion 
that won't be easily visible from the outside.  It's not as if the engine 
is the essence of the bus - it does add to the character but I have decided 
that a bus with a Subaru (or Porsche or Corvair) engine still retains most 
of the essential bus kharma, and therefore the desire to swap engines 
should not be a good reason to &quot;just buy a minivan&quot;.  Some of us would 
simply prefer a quieter, more powerful, more efficient (pick any three) bus.
