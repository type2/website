Subject: Re: [T2] dash vents

From: &quot;David Schwarze&quot; &lt;schwarze_at_mail.ev1_dot_net&gt;
&gt; ... what I really want is the defroster inserts on top of the dash... They
are a bit more complicated than the other parts you've talked about
casting... how good are you?  :-)

I'm casting stretched out sections of mozzarella cheese for a frozen food
company's Quality Control department (QC tool).  If you break the breaded
coating on a cooked mozzarella cheese stick, stretch it out about 6 to 8
inches and quick freeze it, you'll have something fairly close to what I'm
working with for them.

Only the majority of the ones that I get are the rejects, with stringy
projections and weird shapes.  Sort of a &quot;If it looks like this, reject it&quot;
sort of thing for the client's QC folk.

I can do plastic vents. :O)

(... and the client always sends along some product to help keep up our
energy. {grin})

For the record, Giacomo's inserts are in pretty good shape.  They'll need a
little bit of work, but not as much as some of the other repros that I'm
doing.
