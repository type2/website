Subject: My new 2.0L w/pix

My new 2.0L w/pix

Well, it's been almost 3 years now since I killed this engine and I've
finally gotten it all back together.  I originally burnt a hole through
the #4 piston and hand a pretty badly worn cam.  I ended up taking the
whole thing apart and had the case line-bored at rimco, put in a new
cam, reground and balanced the crank, all new bearings and seals, new
pistons and balanced within a gram, rods balanced within a gram, new
cylinders, heads redone, new cam gear, new lifters, flywheel ground and
balanced, pressure plate balanced, fan balanced, tin painted (3 times..
ahhhhhh!!! don't ask), and probably a buncha other stuff.  Of course it
will get ALL new fuel line!

This engine will definately be megasquirt powered, so if you look
carefully at the far side of the picture in the last URL (bottom),
you'll see an O2 sensor bung welded on the exhaust manifold.  I also 
welded a trick little rock guard in front of it ;)

I'll be installing a temperature sensor directly under the #3&amp;4
cylinders to monitor the head temps for the megasquirt.  On my current
engine, I did a test install at the same location and usual temps run 
around 197F after I've been running at freeway speeds on a 70F day. 
I'll try and get some more pics of the megasquirt mods installed (o2 
sensor, temp sensor, etc) when I get to that stage.

Other than that, it's been quite the learning experience.  Remachining
and making broken parts (like the stupid alternator bracket) has proven
to be very time-consuming; so has splitting a glued case 3 times because 
I either stripped a thread or dropped a screw in the case (ugh!).  I did 
get the screw out before splitting the case, but paranoia set in and I 
had to make sure that nothing else was in there.  And yeah, you guessed 
it, nothing else was in there.. hehe

I tried to build everything to the tightest tolerances that my skills 
would allow so that I had a clean, running machine.  I think the next 
engine I rebuild (in the background of some of the pix) will go together 
just a wee bit quicker ;)

enjoy...
