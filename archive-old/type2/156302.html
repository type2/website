Subject: Re: [T2] Driving home from EveryBus at 3,600 MPH!!!

Very cool, Greg.  I enjoyed that.  OK, so you've got the  fastest bus I ever saw.  But everything else still seemed to pass  you up.  You even had trouble keeping up with that Vanagon,  ha.  Who was that, by the way?  Cheers....KR

it's taking a while to get my full EveryBus trip report together, so  
I'll leak a chunk now to tide you over.

What I have for your viewing pleasure is a stop-motion video I made  
using an Apple iSight video camera positioned on the dash of my bus.  
The camera was set up to take 30 frames per minute, and playback is  
set for 30 frames per second. So the video shows the bus heading home  
along the interstate at up to 4000 miles per hour (a little slower on  
the hills, but still respectable at 3000MPH.  I tried to make the  
movie on the way TO EveryBus so we could show it at the campout but  
technical difficulties prevented it. By the time we left I had  
figured out a workaround.

The full movie is about 12 minutes long and it gets kinda boring  
after the halfway point, but that just highlights what a dumb idea it  
was for me to  try to do the return trip without a stopover. Never  
again, says I. When the bus is parked at gas stations and restaurants  
just watch the clouds, 60x acceleration is a cool effect.

If you don't have a high-bandwidth connection you may want to  
download the clip before playback.

My pics and written report should go online by the weekend.


Happy trails,
