Subject: beetle article

Someone posted a story by a guy who worked in electronics (or for an 
electronics magazine?) about why he preferred his 1968 Beetle to any other 
car and would keep it forever. I accidently trashed it and wanted to save 
it. Care to post it again or tell me where it's from so I can find it?
 Thanks
Bob
