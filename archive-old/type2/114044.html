Subject: Re: Shoes

Hmmm - I'm in a library everyday - all day.

Checking....

Got it. Wife is pulling it now. She works upstairs...

Good to work in a library.



&gt;Next time you're in the library, check out Vance Packard's &quot;The
&gt;Waste Makers&quot;...Late 50's maybe early 60's publication about
&gt;the introduction of 'planned obsolescence' into manufacturing.
&gt;BTW, still got a record player, CD player, DVD player, Enhanced
&gt;DVD player, Surround Sound DVD player, all playing the same
&gt;tunes...?
