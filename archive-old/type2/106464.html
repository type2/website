Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

Exactly.

What Jamie wants to do is to achieve 60-65 MPH where the rear wheels 
hit the ground with the amount of airflow through the engine and number 
of RPMs that a stock engine would pull at 55-60 MPH. His new 1.9L T1 
engine makes gobs of torque -- he pulled up next to me when I was going 
up a hill on the way to EveryBus with my foot to the floor, then said 
&quot;Watch this&quot; and suddenly his bus ran off like I was standing still. 
Now I know I was overloaded with the trailer behind but he had a large 
and heavily loaded roofrack up top which didn't do a thing for his 
aerodynamics.

As Andy said, you don't have to use a freeway flyer tranny if you can 
run taller tires.

If Jamie does run taller tires, he will probably want to lower the rear 
suspension a bit to compensate. Every modification comes with a 
trade-off, doesn't it. Even if your canoe up top reduces your MPG, I 
can't imagine it does much for you're bus's cornering characteristics.

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; I realise that we have wandered off of the practical path here. If 
&gt;&gt; you want
&gt;&gt; a modify you van to be highway cruiser, go for it, but theoretically  
&gt;&gt; isn't
&gt;&gt; cooling of a Volks engine also a function of the speed of the fan? 
&gt;&gt; (ie:
&gt;&gt; higher engine rpm=higher fanspeed=more cooling air?) Wouldn't asking 
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; engine to create more torque (more output, thus more waste heat) at a 
&gt;&gt; lower
&gt;&gt; RPM and reducing the amount of cooling air cause the engine to run 
&gt;&gt; hotter?
&gt;
&gt; unfortunately there appears to be a practical maximum amount of air 
&gt; that
&gt; can be pushed thru the cooling ducts, beyond that little additional
&gt; cooling seems to take place, on a type IV engine this seems to be 
&gt; between
&gt; 55-60mph for a stock setup.
