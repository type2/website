&gt; I'm not a pulley expert, but others on the list are.  There is a claim of
&gt; a cast pulley being correct for a 38A generator, but I had a stamped
&gt; late-style pulley that lined up perfectly with both the 38A generator and
&gt; the alternator.

Volks:

I pulled the generator pulley today and may have found the source of the
rumbling.  It seems the pulley is coming into contact with the face of
the generator before it will tighten up the belt.  That would explain
the scraping sound I've been hearing.

What part #'s fit the 38 amp generator?  Or is there supposed to be a
spacer or something in between the pulley and generator facing?

Thanks.
