Subject: Re: [T2] Weird sound... sounds bad... very bad...

Noise when clutch not depressed?  I get a &quot;referred noise&quot; that changes
when the shift lever is pushed to the side; had it for years; changing
the front bushing did a lot to remove it.  The rear bushings are not
present, so I still get some noise (tranny vibration?).
    If your cltch cable is too tight (as in your lining wore on the
clutch disk) you may be always contacting the throwout bearing.  Make
sure there is free play before hitting the bearing.  I check with a hand
on the pesal, not a foot.

&gt; Steve and the list, I have the same symptoms
&gt; regarding the clutch adjusting nut.  Clutch nut
&gt; is all the way in.  Even had to put some washers
&gt; on it when I replaced it with a brand new clutch
&gt; cable.  I didn't measure the cable, but the part
&gt; number was right.  I also replaced the bowden
&gt; tube, but it the TBD repacement was a soft
&gt; rubber.  No idea how to shape the thing like
&gt; bentley describes with the replacement tube being
&gt; as flexible as it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this mean a new clutch, as Benthin suggests
&gt; and as the PO told me, or an almost worn out
&gt; clutch?
&gt; 
&gt; I get a little noise when the clutch is not
&gt; depressed.  The noise changes when I depress the
&gt; clutch.  I also have difficulty shifting into
&gt; first and especially second.  I wrote this off to
&gt; bad synchronizers and am expecting to replace the
&gt; tranny.
