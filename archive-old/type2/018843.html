Stephen,

&gt; there currency hasn't changed radically.  The BR 18,044 comes out to
&gt; US$15,000 at today's  exchange rate.

Good information, thanks!

&gt; Wonder if the inside is similar to our 1972 - 1979?  Middle seat, etc.

You can see some interior shots on 
http://members.tripod_dot_com/~t2ig/archiv/carat_p.html

I think it looks more like a late Vanagon interior.  Much more comfy 
than the Bays, even deluxes, I've seen.  But maybe your Champagne 
Edition and such looked similar?

Yours,
    Erik.
