&gt; HowEVah! And I just learned this: The handle on my 73 goes on a square
&gt; shank that is tapped in the center. The shank on my 69 (and, I just
&gt; learned, Mike's 71) is a different shape, to wit:

&gt; Steve calls it castellated. Did this change occur in 72 or 73?

Ha Ha!
Remove the screw and remove the piece off the square shaft. What you have is
what is left after the plastic handle breaks off!
