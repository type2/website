Subject: Re: [T2] High temp. paints

&gt;I have used this paint.  I put the silver POR20 on my exhaust.  You will
&gt;need to have an ultra clean as in grease free muffler for the paint to
&gt;stick.  Make sure you mix the paint well also as the substance of the paint
&gt;is on the bottom of the can.  I did not super clean the muffler.  Just wiped
&gt;it clean and sprayed it with ospho.  Then wiped it down again and painted
&gt;it.  It's been about 4 months and the silver is flaking off in places but
&gt;overall it is still on there.

I've put the silver POR-15 on freshly sandblasted steel and frankly, in
the midatlantic, it was junk, utter junk.  I think the VHT aerosol stuff we
used on Dolan's was far better, and I'm talking the difference of like OK
after one winter but not great (VHT) versus gone in a couple of fall months
(POR-15).

My experience at least, and I've tried it twice so as not to have just gotten
a bad batch.  A friend used on of the other brand's stuff, maybe Eastwoods
gray and it has lasted well, so who knows.

John
