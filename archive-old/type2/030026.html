Well, I used to use FelPro neoprene gaskets and glue then to the covers
with FelPro yellow gasket glue (which looks suspiciously like weatherstrip
cement).  I coudld get 3 or 4 removals out of them before they would leak.
Then they were a bear to clean.

I now use cheap cork gaskets from my VWFLAPS, stuck to the cover with
hylomar.  Hylomar doesn't really harden, but it sticks well enough to
ensure that the gasket comes off with the cover.  I change gaskets every
time, but the cleanup with the Hylomar is a lot easier than it was with
the yellow gasket glue.  I get very few leaks now.

You never want to use any substance against the head surface.  The surface
is flat and true and should make a good seal by itself.  If you do glue a
gasket to the head you will have a heck of a time getting the head clean
when it comes off.  Sealer and other debris will fall into the valve
springs and be hard to remove.

&gt; Hey,

&gt;   I read in that &quot;How To Keep Your Volkswagon Alive&quot; book that you should 
&gt; glue in your valve gaskets into the vlave covers (not the head)
&gt;   Is this really a good idea??  It only half way makes sense
