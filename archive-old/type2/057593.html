Listees---

It's a sad day for me.  A kid in a jacked up 4WD pick up broad-sided my bus
today.  No injuries, except to my bus.  It was a near death experience for
him
(at my hands), but he was unaware of it.

Bus is a 78 Westy.  Impact is about 14in below side windows.  It's pushed in
about 4in at deepest point.  It's about 7ft long.  The rear wheel well is
slightly
buckled--the storage cabinet and the ice box doors won't open completely.

I'm looking at a RMMW catalog and I don't see the big panels that were hit.
They are the two large main panels than comprise most of the side of the
bus--beginning just behind the driver door and extending to the curved
corner panel at the rear.

Has anyone had a similar repair performed?  Does Das Bulli or anyone else
stock these panels?  Any good suggestions about how to deal with body
shops, insurance agents (Farmers), or _anything_ that will help me restore
my bus will be GREATLY appreciated.  My fear is that the insurance will
want to total my bus, give me a check for $750 and send me on my way.

BTW, can someone tell me how to contact Das Bulli and the other supplier
that Josh Rodgers uses?

For those of you who have had this happen, you know how I feel.  For those
of you who haven't---it feels very bad.

Thanks,

Fred Brittain
78 Westy
