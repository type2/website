Hi,

Paul Morgavo writes:

&gt; My '72 Westy is currently sitting on  205/70R14's.  I heard (possibly
&gt; incorrectly) that this size tire requires a different size rim than the
&gt; stock 185R14's.  Could that be true?

 It could be, but probably isn't. The minimum rim width for a tyre is
specified by the manufacturer. For example, from the Cooper Tires website:

Tire        Service     UTQG   Sidewall Approved    Meas. Section
Overall
Size         Desc.                      Rim Width   Rim    Width
Diameter
                                                    Width
P205/70R14    93 T     440 A B   RWL   5.00 - 6.50  6.00    8.21       25.30



 This shows a 205/70R14 that requires a rim width between 5 and 6.5 inches
and
would therefore fit fine on a bus rim.
 You'll see from the service description (93T) that it isn't actually strong
enough for bus use, though.

 Personally, I would avoid using the &quot;Load Range&quot; description, since that
varies according to the size and intended fitment of the tyre. The Service
description is international, universal and contains the information you
need to know (at least for safety).

 If you like the fat tyres and can find an appropriately rated replacement
then you can stick with them- a 205/70R14 is pretty much the same diameter
as a 185R14C. Theres a pretty strong argument that a wider-than-stock tyre
will increase wear on your (expensive) steering box and be harder work to
park/steer.
 You might also ask what you're gaining from it- a properly specified set
of 185R14Cs will give you a decent ride, secure handling and plenty of
grip for a bus. You could argue that a fat tyre is less safe in wet weather,
since it may be more prone to hydroplaning, and the handling benefits of
a shorter, wider contact patch are unlikely to be perceivable in a bus.

 A smaller tyre would increase torque at the wheels and increase revs.
If you did see higher speeds it would be at higher revs and many
bus owners feel their engine revs too fast already. Few would want to 
compromise their highway speed and engine wear for the sake of a slight
improvement in acceleration and ultimate hillclimbing.
 
Hope this is useful.

Cheers,
	W.
