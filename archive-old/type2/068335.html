Subject: Re: Ever live in your bus?

I lived in mine for a couple or three months. Parked in a friend's front
yard mostly, but in various places on the road. He kept inviting me inside,
but I liked the privacy of my own home. Also, I had a tilted back mattress
that turned my westy bed into the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.
It all started with pair of angled speaker boxes that I gutted and filled
with tools. Put them under the back mattress; then I put a piece of 1/4&quot;
plywood on top, added a couple of 2x4's on the sides for extra support (with
angled cuts on the bottom and on hinges so I could lay the mattress down if
I wanted...and sometimes I needed to). Angled the mattress just enough not
to need a pillow. Also worked pretty well at the drive-in...for reclining
and watching the movie, that is.

I had the cooler, not the fridge, so I cut a cookie pan to make a tray right
over the drain up top; then I bought block ice and used it in there. It
would usually last 3 days, 2 if it was warm out.

Never had to worry too much about nature. When it calls, you'll answer. As
for showers, I was always visiting friends, so I just bummed showers off of
them. Occassionally on the road I'd skip a day or find a friendly pond. A
good swim and a shower are pretty similar.

If you've got the inclination and the bus, it can be a lot of fun. I'd be
more careful these days, though. Of course, a 20 year old probably wouldn't
get hassled as much as a 36 year old living in a bus.

Have fun! Joe

&gt;like to know of your experiences in any bus.  How long did you live out of
&gt;your bus?  What camping equipment did you use?  What about showers and calls
&gt;of nature?  Anyone aware of any books published on this type of living
&gt;situation?  It may seem crazy to some but I'll bet there are some people out
&gt;there who have pulled this arrangement for longer than what most of us
&gt;expect.
