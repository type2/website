Hi,

&gt;&gt;In one of the junk yards out there I saw a loaf bus with the upper
portion
of bug (from about 2 inches below the windows) welded to the top of it.

VERY exciting in a crosswind....

 There's a picture of one of these in Laurence Meredith's Custom
handbook
for the transporter. It's red and the beetle still has it's windscreen
wipers, which I thought was a nice touch!

 Because it only adds the &quot;greenhouse&quot; part of the beetle (from the
bottom
of the door windows up) I think the crosswind problem wouldn't be too
bad
(it's more laterally-aerodynamic than a hightop, for example) but I
would
be concerned about the weight of all that glass &amp; steel up there...

Cheers,
	W.
