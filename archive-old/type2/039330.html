Subject: Re: Portable fridge advice needed

I worked for an old guy once who travelled all over the country doing 
constuction contracting for the govt. He carried a small [about 5 cu. ft., if 
memory serves ]110 freezer in his truck,  [pickup w/ topper] in which he kept 
his meat and frozen veggies, and kept milk jugs frozen for his coolers. He 
could go two or three days if he needed to without plugging anything in, and 
it all froze up solid as a rock overnight when he could plug it in. He 
travelled from Florida to Alaska and back several times using this method, 
and never lost his grub. Also gave him a place to stash bargains he came 
across on the way. Fresh berries, pies, meat, etc. He carried a long cord, so 
he could plug in at the motels or campgrounds he stopped at. 
And I'm guessing you can buy a very small 110 freezer for less than a 12v 
ac/dc refrigerator. It's a thought. I have a small 1-1/2 cubic foot 110 
fridge we take in the bus when we go camping, as long as we're going 
someplace we can plug in. Works great for two people. Cube of about 20 inches 
on a side. Sits right behind the passenger seat. I keep blue ice in the 
freezer box, so it stays cold on the way home with the stuff that came in the 
now-warm coolers.
