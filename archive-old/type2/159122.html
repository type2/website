Hi Volks!

&gt; Do NOT get the inserts - they are not safe on radial tires. They rub on the

They're forbidden by the German T\V for precisely that reason.
Now, that need not interest you over there, but in my experience,
if the T\V says something is unsafe, they say so for a reason.

Airhowlingly yours,
