Subject: Re: [T2] Stoopid vs. muffler


&gt;3. The Ernst german muffler burns off its gray paint
&gt;with a nasty smell and enough smoke to cause alarm. (A
&gt;U.S. Forest Service ranger followed me last weekend
&gt;because he thought i was on fire. Actually, he was
&gt;more worried about the forest than the bus.)

Yep - I could just see the mainstream media getting ahold of a story where 
a &quot;Hippie&quot; bus started the 3 rd largest forest fire in North American 
history...

We'd be banned from the road forever and like the Corvair incorrectly 
labelled usafe forever....

Glad you got your muffler sorted out.
