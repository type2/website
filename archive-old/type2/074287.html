Subject: Re: [T2] Tire sizing to gear down tall tranny for 75?



&gt; To George, Greg, et al-
&gt; Hmm, wonder where I got the idea that 205 tires were smaller but 
fatter
&gt; than 185s??  I was at Volk Tire yesterday and they said they have a 
pair
&gt; of Continentals (185 tires), 6ply rating, for $80 each- I didn't know
&gt; these were still available and is that an OK price??   So you are 
saying
&gt; (George) if there is NO number after the width like 75, the aspect 
ratio
&gt; is 82?

It's either 82, 83, or 85, depending upon who is defining it at the 
time.  In any case, it will be taller than an 80 series, which is the 
tallest size that has the aspect ratio in the tire size.
