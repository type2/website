Subject: Nikki needs HELP!, Again...

Hi Listees;
   Art Lynch here in Texas attempting (yet) another long distance rescue
of Nikki Elko.

   She's currently on the side of the road, IH 10, west of El Paso,
Texas, somewhat inside New Mexico (she has no real concept of distance,
but she has not passed the Border Patrol checkpoint yet, if you know the
area that kinda narrows it down.)

   She was experiencing probable distributor problems, backfiring and
stumbling, and pulled the dizzy to check out the points. The dwell,
which had been holding steady all the way from HCBF, was suddenly &quot;all
over the place&quot;.

   She says the dizzy is &quot;binding&quot; at several points around its
rotation.

   I told her I think the dizzy is dying.

   She does not have a spare.

 I gave her the names of a few of the El Paso AIRS folks that were not
on her printout (printed April '02) so maybe they can help, though they
are all upright engine guys, not a type4 among them. Nearest AIRS guy
with a type4 engine is in Las Cruces NM.

   Anyhow, anybody in that area who can help?

   Any ideas, patches etc. greatly appreciated.

Thanks;
Art Lynch
