this is by far and away the most important thing

&gt; somebody why a gallan of paint can cost hundreds

Imron at several hundred a gallon has got to be the most mind boggling
difficult paint to use....I pained a number of buses with the stuff. Big
buses not my VW...

and then there is that paint that changes color as you look at it, I have
been told it is over a thousand dollars a gallon........a scratch in that
IS a crying event!!  wonder if anyone has ever painted a bus with that??
