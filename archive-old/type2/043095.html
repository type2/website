Subject: Garage worries

Six weeks ago I bought my first bus a 1974 Devon moonraker. A British
conversion that the majority of the listees who live across the pond may not
be familiar with. It had been owned by the PO for 24 years and he had loved
it dearly. I spent just £1800 around $2880. Of course it's changed my life,
I spend alot of time explaining to people how and why but in this instance
I'll take it as given.

I am desperate to learn as much as possible about my new friend and long to
understand it's every piece and their workings and I have learnt alot from
the list so far for which I thank you all. As it is I intend to take the van
around Europe in September, through France, Belgium, Germany, Austria and
Finally down to Croatia, the dalmation coast on the Adriatic sea.

I am this weekend taking the van into the garage, a specialist aircooled
place that maintains all the buses that are used by the Australians, New
Zealanders and South Africans that use Britain as their home base for
travelling around the continent.

It just worries me that the guy will find something to fix whether it really
needs it or not and I may end up paying a high price for peace of mind and
no really desperate mechanical maintenance.

I know that this isn't a very easy subject to help me with but I was
wondering whether the huge experience of the listees could give me any hints
of how not to be caught out.

Thanks
