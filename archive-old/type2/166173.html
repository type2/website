Subject: westy &quot;refresh&quot; project almost finished .. or so i thought

Yesterday after work I was able to get the drag link installed and the 
steering column hooked up to the gearbox.  Feeling brave I decided to 
take it for a drive around the block.  It made the most god awful noise 
I've ever heard.  There was a terrible clunking from the rear end.  I'm 
not sure where to start with it to figure out where exactly the noise is 
coming from and what is causing it.  I do know that the bus needs new 
spring plate bushings and trailing arm bushings.  The shocks are also 
dead.  Could this be all that is causing the noise?  I'm scared to death 
to drive the thing, and have no real means to have it towed anywhere to 
have it looked at.  Not that I could afford to have a real mechanic 
repair it anyway.

I personally took each CV joint apart, cleaned them, reassembled them 
correctly, greased them and put new boots on.  The half axles both move 
freely.  I don't see how this could be causing the noise.

TIA,

dan
