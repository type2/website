&gt; This is obviously a Friday question. How curious though. Do people actually
&gt; haul wood around to make camp fires, and would they pay for it?
&gt; 
&gt; In England and much of Europe, if you're on a proper camp site you probably
&gt; can't light a fire anyway, other than a BBQ. If not you'd be sufficiently in
&gt; the wilderness to gather your own wood on arrival, if you think a fire is
&gt; necessary. Me, I've never lit a fire when out in my camper. Do other people
&gt; do this?

In the US, it is quite common to have a campfire, either for cooking or
warmth.  In many places, picking up deadfall is not allowed.  In others,
such as the deserts, there isn't any wood to pick up!
