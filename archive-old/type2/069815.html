Subject: Cracked Cyl Heads

At a flea market, among stuff scavenged from discards, there were 
several VW dual port cylinder heads.  I studied them closely and 
discovered a tiny crack in the web between the valve seats in each 
example.  Is this a common defect in old cylinder heads?  Can the crack 
be sucessfully repaired?  BTW, I left them where they were.
