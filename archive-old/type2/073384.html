&gt;Having owned and sometimes lived in VW busses over the years, one of my

&gt;and Free Parking (who likes to pay $12 a nite to sleep in a parking lot) as
&gt;their themes.

My favorite places are motel/hotel parking lots.  They are quiet,
relatively safe, I never get hassled there, and they are everywhere.

&gt;Has anyone tried putting solar cells on the roof? I wonder if enough amperage
&gt;can be drawn to keep systems going, as I recall the fridge draws about 8
&gt;amps.

I have two solar panels mounted on the roof of my bus that provide about 4
amps of power in full sunlight.  I would like more but I am somewhat
limited on roof space when compared to a Westy because my highroof gets
narrow - it's barely three feet wide at roof level and the roof vent is in
the way.  The panels are wired through an 8 amp charge controller that is
specifically made to regulate solar panels.  Then to a 12V fuse box and
distribution panel and finally to a pair of Trojan T-105 deep cycle golf
cart batteries.  The whole system cost me about $300 (though the panels are
no longer available at this price) and works very well, although the panels
don't provide enough power to run the fridge constantly.  They do keep the
batteries topped off though.

I would agree with the person who said that going solar is not for
everyone.  It is a lot of trouble and expense and without careful planning
the results will be disappointing.  If you're big on self-sufficience and
gadgetry though, I'd recommend it.  It's nice to know that if you're stuck
in the boonies with a dead battery that you *could* sit in the sun for a
few hours and charge your battery enough to start the bus.  That's cool.
