Subject: Oily Heater air

Hi Gary,

Chances are what is happening is that oil is leaking in top of the heater 
box.  With driving, wind currents blow this oil all around the leak area, and 
it can leak into the heater box where it connects to the exhaust or the 
heater flap connection.

I had this happen on my bus.  I found out that I have some leaky push rod 
tubes.  My mechanic fastened some sheet metal where the leak was occuring, 
forcing it to leak harmlessly off the side, away from the heater box.   This 
seemed to help a lot.

You should also check for leaks to make sure exhaust is not getting into your 
compartment.
