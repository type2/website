&gt; can anybody tell me the physical differances between 36 and 40 HP judson
&gt; superchargers?  also, what does the parts list include?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks.  (this is for my bug.  if only they would fit into a bus w/o
&gt; cutting it up.  sigh.)
&gt; 
&gt; Take care and God Bless

I believe the supercharger itself is the same.  The air cleaner is
different, i'm not sure about the mounting brackets.  If you are running a
12v setup (40hp), you will need to find a porsche 12v generator (smaller
diameter), or change back to 6v, as the supercharger will not fit with a
12v vw generator.  

hope this helps
