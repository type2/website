Subject: clutch problems

rehi

        The clutch shakes the car in between the changing or gears and
starting off. I looked at the cable and it seems to be right. I am going to
try adjusting it this weekend and if that doesn't work i'll probably take
out the engine. Is there anyway to check and see if the flywheel is warped.
Also where can i get motor mounts for my bus that bolt to the rear bracket?

Thanx
