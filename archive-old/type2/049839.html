Subject: Re: [T2] Perceived Value of T4 2L engine cores and avoid being
  ripped off

&gt;The WBX engine (that is a T1 engine with waterjackets: Vanagon) has been 
&gt;perceived as a bad engine, but some on the VANAGON list have found that with 
&gt;the application of some T1 performance parts, a computer chip, some
corrosion 
&gt;protection and MAINTENANCE, it is perceived as a good engine after all and 
&gt;the WBX cores are now increasing in value.  A good used 2.1L is _at_$1000+ up 
&gt;from less than _at_$400 a few years ago.


Uhhh,  if any of you out there are seriously thinking about paying more than
about $150 for a &quot;core&quot; 2.0 air cooled or more than say $400 for one reputed
to be in running shape, let alone more than $500 for any used waterboxer,
you're paying too much.  Yesterday, today, or for at least a few years yet
to come.  Keep looking, I still get 2.0's thrown at me free, and frankly I
sold
the nice used 2.1 out of the '87 for $400 and it took me a while to sell it
last fall, there were plenty floating around at that time, I'm sure I could go
buy one today for that with only a bit of effort.  Hell I can go buy a running
'86 Vanagon for $1000 without too much effort.

Supply and demand are very much related to where you are and to whether
or not you just wait a month or so.  This stuff isn't anywhere near that rare
yet folks.

YMMV.
