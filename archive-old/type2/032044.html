'79 2.0 liter California.
--The first issue is whether or not this is a &quot;california&quot; bus,  The GE
marking on the fan housing would make me think it is.  The points style
distrib would tell me it isn't?
--On Road trip during stops it would sometimes have enough power to
restart and sometimes not.  THen later it would.
--Upon looking around I found that the D- wire (brown) from the regulator
to the alternator was melted. I cut it out and replaced while moving the
harness into a different safer looking routing method.  Was this probable
shorting wire causing my alternator to sometimes charge the battery and
sometimes not?  
--A week or two ago(never having had idle problems) I removed the throttle
valve piece that goes to the EGR valve since my EGR filter is busted off
and I have none of the other California Exhaust pieces anyways.
--Today it died a couple of times at intersections (had radio on once and
off once)  Thought I would adjust the idle.  Seemed to be at 850-900 then
after a couple minutes slowly started falling until it reached 400 or so
and died. (I hadn't revved it upon starting.)  Restarted revved it and set
it to a range where it bounces from 850 to 1000.  Seems Ok now but haven't
tried driving it around in intersections yet.

Is the EGR related to this?
Did replacing the probably shorting melted wire fix the starting/dying
woes? How did the wire get shorted?

TIA
