Subject: replacing rotors
Priority: normal
X-mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v3.12)

i am having a bit of trouble with this task, in fact it is really starting 
to frustrate me. I managed to finally remove the caliper. Now i cant 
get the hex bolts at the front of the rotor in between the wheel nuts 
to undo. I have only maged to get one off. I think so of the heads of 
stuffed and they are rounded because my key keeps on slipping 
out. 

i have to undo these bolts dont i? well i thought so but i cant get 
them out with an Allen key, or with pliers. someone offer some 
advice, i really need to replace the rotors and fast to pass a 
roadworthy test.
