Subject: Re: Starter motors &amp; DIY   successes

Hi Paul,
I suspected that the engine heat had a lot to do with
it because on the 2 occasions in the past when she
would start it was just a case of letting it cool
down.
Having said that,on the way home,when we stopped for
petrol after doing about 120 freeway kms(approx 80
miles) at around 3500 revs the bus started straight
away.
In fact I tried it three times &amp; the starter motor was
fine.
It was certainly warm then but at the end of the
run,once again ,no starter motor action.
Go figure?
I was relieved that I didn't have to lay on the
concrete under the microbus in the middle of a busy
petrol station &amp; hit Millie with a hammer.
It's not good cred for buses:-)
I'm going to get the old starter motor reconditioned
anyway...saves problems in the future.
:-)
Cheers

&gt; Andrew,
&gt;    It's a commom problem with VW buses for the
&gt; starter not to work after a drive that is long
&gt; enough for the engine heat to get the starter hot. 
&gt; Some people live with it and do the 'bang on the
&gt; starter' routine, some install an extra relay to
&gt; work around the starter solenoid, but I've found
&gt; that a once a year sevicing of the starter and
&gt; electrical system prevents the problem.
