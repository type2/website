- &quot;I think it is interesting that though this list includes 80-83
Vanagons,
-not a single peep has been said in their defense. They are actually
-incredibly good type 2's, but maybe they just don't inspire affection
-like loafs. Anyone else have any feelings on this? (I just looked at the
-subjectand realized it says 68-79, but that doesn't usually reign in
-most participants!)&quot;

I have never been in loaf, yet I still crave one over my 81 V'agn Westy,
though the V'agn is probably better suited as the family of 4 camper it
is yet to be.  There's something about a hardtop Loaf camper that
inspires me.  I think it's the romantic notion of traveling around the
country alone in the hard top. No real need for the pop top if alone -
sealed against bad weather, perhaps with a kayak on top.  In the March
issue of SeaKayaker there is an ad (see the back cover, I can't tell what
year) for the Perception Kayak company that states &quot;we started Perception
back in the '70s, so you'll understand if the exact date is a little
fuzzy&quot; and it shows a loaf with 5 kayaks on the roof.  It's the romantic
ghost of a time that was a little before my time (38yr old) of an image
that is stronger than what an ad agency could ever dream up for a new car
(although the new Beetle ads come close, but then again they're just
having you apply the romantic ghost feeling to a new vehicle). As I see
that hard top loaf camper loaf every day driven by a 20 something, I do
not think about that he is freezing in this weather and focus on the
romantic image. Well, reality is I got two young kids, two dogs 85lb and
100lb and the V'gan is probably best - now I just thank god that my westy
has round headlites (believe it or not,  I even envied the modern V'gans
with their Euro lites and color coordinated roofs and tents until looking
at the LiMBO site made me realize that the older V'gans are cooler!)
