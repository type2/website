&gt; Secondly, I replaced all of the rear CV joints &amp; boots.  The old ones had
&gt; these weird little batwing-shaped spacer/washer things that go between the
&gt; outside of the boot and the bolts that hold the CV boot/joint in place.  One
&gt; was missing when I removed everything, and the new CV joints/boots did not
&gt; come with this hardware (or any, for that matter).  Rocky Mountain Motorworks
&gt; doesn't seem to carry them, and I would rather buy one than have my husband
&gt; try to make one at work.  Any suggestions?

RMMW doesn't have the washers you describe separately because they're in the
CV kits they sell. If you bought the CVs from the , call and ask where the
rest of the kit is; if not, you may want to return the CV you have to
wherever you got it from and order one from one of the Big Three suppliers
everyone here seems to like--RMMW, Bus Depot and aircooled_dot_net.

&gt; And lastly, can a clutch cable stretch?

Yes it can.
