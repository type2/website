Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Question..I already lookied in archives, I
  promise

&gt; I'm going to check my timing this weekend, I think everything's good, but I
&gt; want to check it as part of a tune up, plus I thought if I check it while its
&gt; right, it'll be easier for a dumb guy like me. Anyways, here's my question: I
&gt; have a 1970 w/ a 1776, dual Kadron's and an 009 distributor. I read that to
&gt; find 30 deg BTDC I measure 43mm to the right of TDC. Do I measure a straight
&gt; line (point to point) or along the egde (arc) of the pulley?

Since you cant be sure your pulley is the same as the guys who wrote
this....

The least error prone way I would think of with primative tools
would be to measure the actual diameter with a tape measure
then for 30 degrees
(diameter/360) x 30   which is     diameter / 12

measure that length around the circumference from TDC
Make sure you are at TDC not every pulley is marked the same

You could use a protractor but youd have to find the real center and
project the lines out
this seems like it would be more error prone.
