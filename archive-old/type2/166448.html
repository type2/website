Subject: Re: [T2] First Bus / Rebuild or Buy Longblock ?

Hi Roger,

First off, what year is your bus??   If it has a 1600 in it, I would  
suspect it's  a 68-71 model; though the 1600's  were offered in 72-79  
buses in europe and Australia.

If your bus is a 68-71, you don't have the right hardware to install  
a 2L. Your cooling system, exhaust, alternator and engine mounts are  
completely different from what is needed for a 2L engine.  You would  
be much better off rebuilding your existing engine into a 1776cc   
configuration instead.

The one advantage to building your own is that you know precisely  
what's inside. The downside is that there's no-one else to blame if  
something goes wrong.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

The previous owner let his 17yr old son drive the bus while the son's
car was in the shop!  The #3 exhaust valve broke off hit the piston
turned sideways and jammed its way into the head.  I am looking at new
heads $400, gaskets/bearings $100, cylinder &amp; pistons $300, $300 cam,
machine work etc.   I am new to this world of air-cooled, rebuilt a lot
of Jeeps and GM.  It seems to me that from a cost standpoint, due to the
damage, that a long block is pretty close to the cost of me buying the
parts and having the machine work done and putting it together myself.
Not to mention buying a long block for $1600 incl. shipping gives me the
chance to upgrade to the 2000.

Am I correct in this dilemma?  Anyone else run the numbers and come up
with this?  Am I missing something?
