Re: [T2] exhaust questions.


You will need a few more parts to make this work correctly:
Both front lower cylinder tin.
Both lower tin.
Both air tubes that go thru the upper cylinder tin to the boxes.
The 72-74 alt support.


       Does the 72-74 alt support bracket bolt to the R/H heat exchanger? My
73's bracket is there but has been cut off where it attaches to the heater
box.
I've got new boxes coming from Bus Depot so will see if there's an a
attachment for the bracket.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On a 2.0, the arm is short and attaches to the welded-on bracket on top of the
exhaust pipe coming out of the box.
On 72-74, the arm is longer and bolts to the side of the heater box.
