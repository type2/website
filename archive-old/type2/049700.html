Subject: RE: [T2] Plans for Camper Conversion

Looking in the new Bus magazine, I see that 'Just Kampers' are going to sell
flat pack DIY interiors! In addition the mag says it is in the process of
making an article with plans of interiors.

Remember you can win this 1st edition by submitting a humorous suggestion
for the top 10 of &quot;what not to do _at_ a VW show&quot;, but all submissions should
be made

_OFF LIST_
 to events_at_type2_dot_com or nishikigoi_at_btinternet_dot_com
