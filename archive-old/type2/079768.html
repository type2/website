I agree with the idea that the bus will name itself.  I have had my bus for 7 
years, but no one at work has ever seen it although I talk about it 
frequently and am always threatening to get it on the road &quot;this summer&quot;...  
A woman I work with came over for my husband to look at her car and she asked 
to see it.  She said she thought it was a figment of my imagination until she 
saw it.  And Phigment was born...
