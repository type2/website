Subject: Need intake gaskets/p-plate for sale

List,
I'm having trouble finding intake gaskets for a carbed
type4.  I'd like to have the one-piece gaskets that go
with the single 2bbl weber conversion package, but if
i can get the stock ones, i can make them work.

I guess i can make them if they have gone the way of
the Dodo...

Also - i have what appears to be a NOS Sachs 215mm
pressure plate. I have a 210mm flywheel so i can't use
it.  I can get you pics. Make me an offer.

later,
clark
morehead, ky
