Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Early detection of fire in engine compartment

I also had the brass fitting pull out of the carb on my Campmobile, but I
was lucky, I found it before it caused a fire ( petrol POURING out of the
engine bay is not a good sign, and leads to investigation. )

As Dave said, it's something that needs to be checked regularly, as well as
the fuel lines ( which I'd replaced a couple of weeks before that, WITHOUT
checking the carb fittings, as I didn't know that they came loose ).

&gt; Marcus,
&gt;
&gt; been there and done that...in a 67 I once owned.  The brass fitting
&gt; **did** come out of the carb...with the new fuel line still firmly
&gt; clamped to it.
&gt;
&gt; Whenever I work on a carb like that now, that is the first thing I do.
&gt; The second thing is to tap the accelerator pump fuel injection
&gt; nozzle down with a punch and hammer so it doesn't fall down the intake and
&gt; into the engine.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry about your splity.  :-((
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
