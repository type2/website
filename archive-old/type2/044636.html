Subject: [T2] Closeout on Mufflers!

I just obtained a closeout on Danish made '72-74 bus mufflers from a
wholesaler who had excess inventory.  These are very good quality, as heavy
duty as the original German ones and far superior to the Taiwanese extractor
systems usually sold for this price. They will also fit '79-83 bus and
Vanagon (if you buy the kit), but do not provide for a catalytic converter.
(In fact, this system was used stock thru '83 in Europe, where no cat was
required.)  They will even fit '75-78 if you use '72-74 heat exchangers.
This is the best quality muffler you can put on your bus, other than buying
the stainless steel version (which is $80 more).

I normally sell the muffler only for $139.95, or the full exhaust system
(including tailpipe and mounting kit) for $159.95.  That is already about
1/3 off retail.

The muffler is now $99.95, or $119.95 for the whole kit.  This is what the
muffler normally _wholesales_ for.  I have only 8 sets to sell for this
price.  It is highly unlikely that I will find more at this price again.

Part numbers are 071 251 053E for the muffler only, or 071 251 053EK for the
whole kit.  You can order toll-free by part number at 1-888-819-DEPOT, or
via the website.  The price will be adjusted on the website tomorrow.  If
you order sooner than that, just specify in the comments section that you're
a listmember and we'll adjust the price accordingly prior to charging you.
When the 8 are gone, the price will go back up.
