Subject: Solid rocker shaft setup
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSD.3.90.990316123249.18101D-100000_at_user2.mnsinc_dot_com&gt;

Well, I am working ont he rockers for my '71 Dualport 1600.

I got the solid rocker shafts from Autocraft, (Cheaper
than new stock shafts) but have some questions about
the setup of the shafts. 

1) Should I use a springy washer on each side? Is it
required? If so, how hard should it push on the side of the rockers?

2) If I dont use a springy washer, what should I set the 
end play to. One guide I saw said .006, but that is hard
as all of the spacers are .015. 

Autocraft says that some do it one way, some do it the other.
(Big help, thanks...)

So, anyone else use these and can tell me what worked for them?

PS: Cant we all just stop chest thumping about T-I vs T-IV engines?
Few people would change what they have, and if they do, I am sure
that they have good enough reasons for themselves.
You pennance: Say 15 'Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey's and 
grease 10 zerk fittings.
