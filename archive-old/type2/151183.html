Subject: back window/new seal installed

Put in the new back window last night after painting the hatch the day
before.

Mild rust under the glass when removed, brass wheel, sandpaper, paint.

New seal from the busdepot fit well, and I used the rear window out of a '79 I
used to have which didn't see much action so the glass is nice, also lightly
tinted from factory, anyone care to comment?  Defogger electricals look good
on it.

The seal has a cross-sectional seam in it which I noticed I had installed
dead-on centerline of the bus without trying.  Little good karma coming back
after shattering last window on myself during removal.

I like mechanical/electrical bolt up parts, hand me glass or wood and I will
detonate/set it on fire accidentally.  Not enough patience.

Back of bus is looking good with new paint/seals everywhere.  Need new
bulbholders for taillights, anybody parting?
