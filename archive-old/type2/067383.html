Another story about oxygenated gas. New York area starts using it today. 
New Jersey reports a %15 decline in CO after using it for a while (not 
sure how long).

There's a controversy about whether it causes ill health effects - 
nausea, dizziness, etc. Gas company claims it's fine (of course).

EPA has targeted 30-some metropolitan areas which will have to sell it. 
It's becoming a fact of life...
