Subject: Raising a '71 bus to stock height
Message-ID: &lt;7jmgko$qrm5_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

I recently bought a '71 camper and the person who previously owned it lowered it (God knows why....).  I want to raise it back up to stock height.  Any advice about doing this would be appreciated.  What parts will I need?  Are any special tools necessary?  Does anyone who has raised a bus have any advice?  

Thank you all in advance
