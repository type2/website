Subject: Re: [T2] Starting question:


In response to using Mann filters and the anti-drainback valve, I got less 
startup clatter from Fram and Wix filters than I did from the Mann filters I 
have tried(on my WC Vee-Dubs).  I know.  It sounds loco, but I honestly 
attest to this.  I DID however have better luck using Mahle filters.  Seem 
to be better quality.

	Eron
