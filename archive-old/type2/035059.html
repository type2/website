Subject: So what costs $5000?

As I said in a prior post, I've got some empirical evidence to back up my 
$5000 figure. But what costs so much?

First of all, &quot;reliability&quot; is a relative term. Reliable to someone who 
is single, 22 years old, and mechanically inclined, may mean a matrix of 
vehicle and driver that always gets home in part because of the shear joy 
of MacGuiverismo.

That's not my definition.

Here's mine:

You are about thirty and your wife is seven months pregnant with your 
first child. It's the dead of winter in Maine and the mother-to-be has 
signed the both of you up for Lamaze classes at the local hospital, just 
twelve miles from your house. Tuesday nights. By some freak of nature, 
every Tuesday night the mercury drops into single digits and lower.

Frankly, the wife hates the bus -- wants to get a Jeep Cherokee -- and is 
looking for any excuse to make you trade. So one mishap, and it's over.

That's my standard for reliable.

So, a couple of years ago you bought the bus (a '77) for $1500. Minor rust. 
Compression was 110, 105, 105, 105 when you bought it.

First thing you did was to replace all the fuel lines ($50), the brake 
hoses ($50), and replace the brake fluid. Add $110.

Although the front pads were pretty good, the rear shoes were worn. $20. 
Now the front pads are wearing thinner. $20.

The bus had passenger tires on it when you bought it. Sensibly, you 
replace them with Yokohama 356s on all four corners and the spare. $400.

As a matter of course -- remember, the issue is reliability -- you 
replace the clutch cable, the accel cable, and the #2 sensor. $35.

With all this in place, you notice that the engine feels sluggish. You 
test the compression again. It has changed to 105-100-90-80. Time for a 
new engine. I'm going to round to $2000.

On reinstalling the FI you find that the engine runs way too lean. You 
troubleshoot and find that the injectors are sub-par ((one of today's 
threads). $240.

Rear shocks feel spongy. $50.

I've lost count, but I am getting on up toward $5000, and I am talking 
about replacement parts that are discussed _all the time_ on this list. 
Not surprises. Not bad luck. Ordinary in-the-course-of-owning-a-bus stuff.

Even though there are people on the list who have picked up a bus for 
under $1000 and never done a thing to it, that's just luck.
