Subject: Ball joint work

I'm thinking about doing some front end work on my Bus. Ball joints
and wheel bearings will be done together since I have everything
apart.

I'm under the impression that some had trouble getting there ball
joints pressed out at a local machine shop?  Is it uncommon for a
machine shop to not have the correct fittings to be able to press out
the old joint and press in the new?  Is there special jig needed.

If it's a big hassle finding someone with the proper equipment I 
will purchase rebuilt torsion arms from Bus Boys. They come with the
ball joints pre installed. I see a $75-$100 savings though by getting
the joints pressed myself. 4x Ball joints $70,  ~$30 press labor. 
Compared to $175 for rebuilt Bus boys.
