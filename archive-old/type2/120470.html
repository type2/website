Subject: Movie sightings, seat belts

&quot;The Big Empty&quot; preview includes the main character
driving a shiny bus.

Looking forward to hearing responses to the rear seat
belts request.  This spring I'll need to figure out
how to fit two L-shaped booster seats in the back,
ideally with a shoulder belt conversion, minimally 1
booster seat   in seat behind the driver.  Can that be
safely converted to a shoulder belt?
