Tell your mechanic to change the word can't, to won't.  There is an
adapter/base plate * if you can find one* with a tube built into it,  for
connecting the booster hose. I found one at a salvage yard  *
www.interstate_dot_com/about.html * for a 72 bus I had last year.

&gt; I have a 72 bus and My mechanic and I just realized the other day that it
has
&gt; power brakes on it.  We relized that the vacume hose was not hooked up so
I
&gt; asked my mechanic to do it and he said it can't be done because I have a
&gt; single Weber double barrel carb.  Is this true?
