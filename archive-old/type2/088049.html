Subject: Re: [T2] hub caps


&gt; &gt; Anyway, my 72 weighs 3100 lbs + or - 20 lbs as indicated by the
certification
&gt; &gt; issued by the state of Colorado.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yours is light compared to my 77 deluxe Westy.
&gt; &gt; Curb weight [without me in it] is 3820 lbs.
&gt;
&gt; That's one heavy fridge.  What else is in it? It should only weigh about
&gt; 3300 lbs just as the owner manual states. I confirmed this on a scale before
&gt; I bought my recent set of tires.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; http://type2_dot_com/bartnik/manual/pg79.jpg

That page only lists &quot;Campmobile&quot; with no difference between a non-pop top, a
pop top, or a deluxe.
The deluxe has the added weight of the fridge instead of a cooler, the stove,
the propane tank, the front table, the stool/trash container.
Plus the 7 gallons of water in the water tank, and propane in the tank....
