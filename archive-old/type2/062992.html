Subject: Possible Bus Raffle

OK--This is a possibility but we need to make sure that this does not 
cause any problems for Ken or the List.  So at this point there 
should be no more mention of $$.

Let me start by giving the info on the bus and all who are interested 
please email me personally.  Then I can get back to you with all 
details.

1976 Orange Standard Westy.  
120,000 miles.
30,000 miles on current engine.
5000 miles on German clutch I put in last year--4 speed
5000 miles on new cv boots
Body fair shape minimal rust dents and dings are there.  
One day paint and body said that to take out all dents and repaint 
they want $900(Take this for what it is worth)
interior is good shape cabinets need some veneer --sink pump is new.
Has oraange and green plaid interior.  
Front seats recently redone with green striped fabric
Canvas is good.
Seal is pretty good.
tires are in if good shape
has trailer hitch(who knows why)
front mounted spare
cd radio
OK stereo with four speakers
has bug screen(needs a few snaps put in back)
This bus is strong and will be missed I was not planning to get rid 
of it but found the 79 and had to buy it.

This bus passed california smog last year but it does not have a 
catalytic converter.  It was bought in Germany by a guy in the 
service and brought to the US.  Was in Oklahoma, Texas and has been 
in LA area for 10 years-

Maybe if someone can scan a picture for me I can send one to 
them!!!???

I have all the original manuals etc.

Please email me if interested and I will keep track .
If we get enough people we can give this a shot.
