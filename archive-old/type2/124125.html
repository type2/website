Subject: Fw: [T2] How does one aquire H20 in gastank?

You may want to drop the tank to inspect it.  These tanks are prone to rust
out in their top center where there's a &quot;valley&quot; that's perfect for
collecting water-retaining &quot;stuff.&quot;  There's also some seals and hoses up on
top of the tank that could go bad, allowing in water that gets up there.

&gt; I just made a 1,400 mile voyage in the 80 Vanagon with only one minor
&gt; problem.  When its pouring rain I get water in my gas.  The engine hatch
is
&gt; dry so its likely not condensation in the dist cap or brain.  Its getting
in
&gt; the tank.  I know this because it completely clogged one of my fuel
filters.
&gt; I9ve never had the tank out but from what I understand its completely
&gt; sealed.  I suspected the gas cap itself but I can9t be sure.  I thought
&gt; there looked like a bit of water on the inside of the seal which is a bit
&gt; cracked.  I packed a rag in there and it seemed moist but also smelled
like
&gt; gas, so I dunno.  There is a gap in the filler hose behind the passenger
&gt; wheel, and I thought maybe that was a suspect.  Anyone else had a similar
&gt; problem?  Its frustrating, but not debilitating yet.  The sudden chugga
chug
&gt; the water causes is dangerous! Especially in traffic!  Thanks so much, Nik
