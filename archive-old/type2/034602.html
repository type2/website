Subject: delivery of the items

Made the delivery today.  Good time from Charleston to Augusta, the
Tinkertoy was loving a road trip.  The stereo decided to stop making
music for an hour so I got to listed to all her sounds.  I sometimes
forget how cool a bus at cruising speed sounds.

Delivered the shiny hubcap to Dave Raistrick's, got the guided tour of
Itchigo and the collection, played witht he goats, looked at the beaver
tree (almost cut down) had a most wonderful dinner with the entire
family, and got lost on the way home.

I've gotten lots of hate mail about cleaning the hubcap off.  OOPS!
