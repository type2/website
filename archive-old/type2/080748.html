Subject: Re: is AFM damaged by backfire?

Your original (backfired) AFM may have damaged the flap spring or internal
wiper on the resistive board-- get it in your hands-does it open and close
smoothly when you push the flap in manually? (ie, sticking nowhere?)  Remove
the cover (may have to chip away the glue, then pry it off).  Now oerate the
flap and watch the little arm- does it contact the resistive board properly
?  I don't have the diagram in front of me; but you can check the restistive
path variation with an ohmeter on the correct pair of terminals.
----- Original Message ----- I've been thinking more and I know what caused
my AFM to die. In the course of getting the bus running, we managed to cause
some back-fires. A couple of these blew off one of the large tubes that
connects to the S-tube. I'm thinking that one of these also damaged
something in the AFM. That is a lot of air pressure going the wrong way.
