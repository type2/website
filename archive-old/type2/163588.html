&gt; Here's what Tuna Can says about AP:
&gt;
&gt; AP  '74-'75 VW Transporter   7.3:1  68hp  Only sold in Europe.  Came with
&gt; dual carbs.
&gt;
&gt; CB talks to a 1700:
&gt;
&gt; CB  1972-73 VW Transporter   7.3:1 63hp _at_ 4800, 81 Ft-lb _at_ 3200   Dual-carb,
&gt; manual trans. &quot;Manual&quot; trans indicates it was made by Mexicans  ;-)
Yeh..thats where my confusion stems from..conflicting info on the
fanshroud/case.  I'll have to measure once I get the heads off and
such.


&gt;
&gt; Check thesamba for 1800 P&amp;C.  Yes, we know, AA Performance, they were made
&gt; in China, but can we lay aside some of our big-a-tree here....
&gt;

I have seen that as well, but I have a feeling I'm going to need more
then just the P&amp;C.

Can anyone tell me the size of the studs I need to get the engine up
on the yoke?  I'd like to start tearing it down as soon as I can.

Thanks again for all the help
