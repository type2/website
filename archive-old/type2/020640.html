&gt; Just to add a little more confusion and profess my ignorance of the

Dave:
I've seen it in the parts books (and e-brake cables, too), but never
have seen a 68 thru 70 with a servo. Maybe in Europe? (I've had it on
good report and have seen brochures showing Brazilian buses of about
1982 that have servos and drums)
