Maybe gas is getting in your oil, that will make the level go up. Just a
thought.

Subject: [T2] Strange Oil Level: Epilogue


&gt; Hello Again -
&gt; Well, for those of you who remember my recent post where I changed my oil
&gt; on the road while camping and then noticed how continually &amp; unusually
high
&gt; my oil level was on my dipstick, and are interested in the result: it's
&gt; been kind of inconclusive, but the reason is obvious.  After not being
able
&gt; to comfortably deal with knowing that my oil was way too full (like, a
half
&gt; inch above the dipstick's full line) after a normal oil change, I decided
&gt; to do it all over again - complete with new filter and all new oil after
&gt; only some 150 miles since the change.  When I drained the oil from my
&gt; engine, my plastic drain pan seemed fuller than usual and then when I
&gt; transferred it into a plastic 1-gallon milk jug (for recycling purposes),
I
&gt; found that there was so much more oil in there than the other jugs that I
&gt; had sitting nearby from other recent oil changes.  Like, way too much more
&gt; oil.  I have no idea how so much extra oil could've been in there - it
&gt; looks almost as if I put in 4.7 qts rather than 3.7, but I know that is
&gt; impossible.  (I'm way too anal for that.) Regardless, after the new oil
&gt; change, all is well and levels are now good and normal.  I just wish I
knew
&gt; how so much extra oil could've gotten in there - I have thought &amp;
rethought
&gt; that maybe I didn't drain out the old oil long enough the first time
&gt; through, but I just don't see how that could've happened as I remember how
&gt; long I let it drip, and so slow at that.  And hopefully I did no damage
&gt; running my engine on this much oil - can anyone ease my worried mind on
&gt; that one?  Thanks once again!
&gt;
