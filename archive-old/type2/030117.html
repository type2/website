&gt; If you're going to go this route, I suggest loosening the rockers to

&gt; because it's going to leak somewhere.  Use only new oil, as old oil will
&gt; have acids that are bad for the engine.

replying to my own post, just to say that I really feel bad for the guy
who has to unpickle this engine 20 years from now!  Whatta mess!  OTOH, he
will probably be thrilled to be getting such a cherry engine!
