Subject: Re: German Transaxle of America

I live up here in Nanaimo, on Vancouver Island, and even up here we've heard
of German Transaxle and their quality work. Ken  probably doesn't remember,
but he answered some questions for me when I dropped by his shop about a
zillion years ago, about HiPer tranny ratios etc. He also gets to live in
Gods country too, probably the only place in the whole world that I'd live
besides my gorgeous island.
Regards,
Courtney
