&gt; I have a VDO tach, a Series 1, that I bought a few months ago.  I
&gt; tried to wire it up this past weekend, but when I looked at the
&gt; instructions, they were for a different tach.  My tach has
&gt; terminals 2,3, and 4 on it, so I need to know which ones get wired
&gt; to +12V, Gnd, and signal.

Hey there Jim,

The +12v goes to pin #2, the gnd goes to #3, and the signal (- on
coil) goes to #4.
  
&gt; Also, there's a small 3-position switch. Does this need to be set
&gt; in any particular way?
 
Yep, it's surposed to be #1 on, #2 off, and #3 off for 4 cyl
applications. 

Hope this helps,
