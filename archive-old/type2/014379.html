Subject: Cheap timing light/tach-dwell meter and other tools?


Greetings Volks,

I just helped 2 wonderful young women pick up a 1969 Transporter with
a strong engine at a pretty reasonable price, but, they spent a bit
more than they wanted to (or had budgeted for) for the sake
of a good running bus.

That being the case, they're trying to spend as little money
as possible to pick up the tools they'll need to maintain it,
notably, a timing light, a tach-dwell meter, and the associated
tune-up tools.  None of these items is particularly expensive,
but to someone with very little cash in the bank (&lt;$200), these costs
add up quickly.

That said, if anyone in Southern (or Northern, as they'll be headed
there soon) California, or anyone who wouldn't mind shipping stuff,
has some old tools lying around that aren't being used
that they'd be willing to part with for fairly cheap, please
let me know.

 As far as other concerns regarding travelling on little money, etc.,
these lasses have plans on picking up work, have plans (credit cards, etc.)
for contingency monetary requirements, and have lots of friends/family
along their planned route, they're just looking to cut down on as many
costs as possible.

Hope this finds all your volks well, and having a nice Friday...
