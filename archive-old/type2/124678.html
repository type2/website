&gt;
&gt; If ya want the really really hi temp stuff, you want to visit someplace
&gt; where they carry airplane parts....and it is &quot;silver&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; I have a buddy(A&amp;P mechanic) that gave me a whole bottle of the
&gt; stuff...says good to 2500 degrees right on the bottle.
&gt;
&gt; Don't remember who made it, but can look if anyone is really interested.
&gt;

Or you can use the stuff I got at my local bearng house.....&quot;Nuclear Grade&quot;
Anti-Seize. Yup, that'a what it says right on the can. I originally bought
it to coat retaining bolts on high-temp extrusion dies and since it worked
so well there I tried it on my bus in various places. Hasn't caused any
problems that I can tell.

Regards,
Dave
