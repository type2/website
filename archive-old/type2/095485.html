Subject: RE: Scat linkage for Kadrons

  You need to grind or drill the balls on the Kadron arms to remove(SCAT is
working on the correct carb linkage pieces for Kadrons). You will need to
purchase a universal throttle return spring and rig it up off of the barrel
nut. This is how I have done it (more then once)

John, list et al,
bought the scat centrepull linkage from John Connolly, installed it for my
Kadrons on my bug, but two things.

1)  I take it I have to pull the linkage balls from the carbs themselves??
Seems like the only way.

2)  There is no setup for attaching the return spring on the linkage? What
to do??

Thanks, I'm waiting for this reply so I can finish today.
