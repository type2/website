Don't panic yet.  I can think of a couple of things.  First, if the
tranny is hanging lower than with the engine in place it messes up the
geometry.  Try jacking/blocking it up to level with something.  Next,
check the shift rod connections.  Make sure the set screws are holding
the pieces with no slippage(don't ask how I know that one;).  

Good luck
