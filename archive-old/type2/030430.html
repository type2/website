Volks,

Lars asked if his lists were OK, and I want to clear up what is OK, what
is not, and why.  

If you have suffered a lost bus, the insurance offers are sometimes
pitifully small.  A search of various for sale sites will give you a list
of buses currently for sale, but that universe may not be large enough to
be useful.  The continuing series that Lars, Sean, Ron, and Jerry are
posting wind up in the archives and are searchable, giving a much broader
field.  In addition, it is nice that the four of them happen to be in
different parts of the country (if someone overseas wanted to start, that
would be fine, too :)

Lars,

Posts of buses for sale are fine, any year.  I love it when they are bay
window buses, but splits and wasserboxers are good too.  As a single
post, I would strongly discourage non-bus for sales (the charter says
no), but in series such as yours, adding on other air-cooled VW's is OK.
Non-VW's are never &quot;on topic&quot;, tho.

I think what you, Sean Bartnik, Ron Van Ness, and Jerry Jess are doing is
a fine thing, not only for the wannabussers on the list, but also for
anyone who loses their bus in an accident and has to establish worth.
For example, a list of half a dozen '76's that were advertised within the
last year for 2-3000 makes an insurance companies offer of 500 look a
little small and gives you a definite bargaining chip in settlement
discussions.
