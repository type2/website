Subject: juddering brakes

Hi all
 
hope you can help me with this one:- sorry it's not bus but someone might
have had same prob with an early bus - almost the same set up.

My problems : overwieght, - can't spell, drink way too much, bone idle (so
my wife says) 62 bug has a serious judder when braking - not when easing
down on brakes but when applying moderately firm pressure. Can't figure it
out. It's still got a stock beam, not lowered, it pulls up evenly even when
giving it some
doesn't even pull to one side if i let go of steering wheel when braking.
other than that the car drives well. 

Any ideas?

It may be something obvious, so any ideas however daft they seem to you,
please. 
You know what it's like if someone comes to me with a problem i can
&quot;usually&quot; sort it straight away. but when i've got a problem, me mind goes
blank. Usually due to the worry of the cost of the repairs.

many thanks and happy hauntings. I'm going for a few beers now,cheers to you all

Glynn (62 bus, 62 bug, 71 Fiat 500)
