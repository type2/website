Subject: Can I staticly (sp?) time my '77 bus?

I need to time my '77 'loaf (automatic), and was wondering if static or
dynamic timing is best? 

I own a timing light, but when I put it on there, the mark jumps around
between 8 and 4 degree's BTDC.  I thought maybe doing a static timing would
allow me to get it right.

Also, for the beginner, which is easier?

Thanks!
Marcus
