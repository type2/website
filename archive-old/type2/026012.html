&gt; any tips on putting all of this back together?  anything i should do in
&gt; addition while i have everything apart?  i'm assuming i should use
&gt; anti-seize on the exhaust bolts, what about the nuts for the studs?  since
&gt; the engine is out, it is probably easier to put the exhaust manifold and
&gt; gaskets on BEFORE i install the engine?  i also bought a new foam engine
&gt; seal (thanks mice!)  at what stage should i put this on, before or after
&gt; the engine is in the compartment?

Use anti seieze on all the bolts and nuts.  The engine seal is put in after
the engine is installed.  You may have to work the engine seal from above
and below, it takes a little time, but well worth it.

&gt; also, what tools/cleaners has anyone used to clean the engine?  the shop
&gt; fellas were against steaming the engine.

Use some none flamable solvent to get the major grease loosened up, then use
Simple Green on the lighter stuff.  You won't believe how clean that Simple
Green can get your engine and engine bay.  You can get the solvent at your
auto parts store and Simple Green at WalMart.
