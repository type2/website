Subject: westy top for free in long beach, ca 

ok, here i am stirring up some good carma here.  i
just picked up a high roof and am therefore not going
to be needing my westy top.  so to the first person
who emails me you can have my westy pop top.  it
includes the canvas (homemade but rather workable)
hinges and the metal piece that holds the canvas down.
 nothing really wrong with it at all and i've used it
quite a bit actually but i figured that the high roof
would fit my uses a bit better.  so if you want it the
only catch is you have to help me take it off and help
me set the high roof up on top of the bus.    email
off list for this deal please as we don't want the
list clogged up with this stuff

now in junk yard news.  for  all you lucky enough to
be enjoying this sweet so cal weather and can get away
from your significant others for a spell.  at the
wilmington ecology auto recycler off the wilmington
exit on the 405 for those who haven't been there is
the 73 bus i took the high roof off of.  on that very
bus is factory a/c, not the pumps and all the rear
stuff mind you but just the front stuff, the fan, the
ducting and vents under the dash, stuff like that.  it
is a bit rough but looks to be quite workable.  i
didn't take it out and figured one of you would like
to add it to your bus to make the other people in your
life more comfortable.

peace and have a great vw day out there people.
