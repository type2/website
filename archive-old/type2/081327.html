Subject: 2nd Annual LiMBO On Long Island (New York) Campout.

Hello Everybody,
    The Long Island VW Bus Alliance invites you, yes ALL of you, to the 2nd
annual LiMBO on Long Island event.  Mark your calendar for....June 7, 8, and
9th 2002 as the last LiMBO newsletter did post the incorrect date...so
please be advised of this updated info.  For complete info go to
http://arasso.tripod_dot_com/limbo/ or p-mail me.
    Last year, the first for this event, saw 26 buses from 6 different
states come together for the weekend.  The park we hold this in is right on
the water so it is perfect for swimming, fishing, and boating, so BYOB
(Bring Your Own Boat)  In addition, the park has hiking trails and a small
petting zoo.  The east end of Long Island is great for bicycling and the
park isn't far from the local wineries.
