Subject: burned exhaust valves

It's been a while since I've posted... Since replacing the heads on my 
'79 Westy with a set of rebuilt ones, I've had a hard time getting my 
engine running well again.  After one mechanic, there were still 
supposedly &quot;vacuum leak problems&quot;.  My testing showed crazy low 
compression, roughly 60psi all the way around (down from a max of 
~100psi early after the rebuild.)  I thought my gauge was off, til I 
took the bus to another mechanic for a leakdown.  The test showed 
something like 80% (!) leakage, so I had the mechanic pull the heads to 
check them.  Sure enough, solvent leaked right out.

So, the heads were just barely still under warranty from a certain 
rebuilder in Sacramento.  The company has always been helpful and they 
asked me to send the heads back.  Today, I got a call from the company, 
as it turns out, the exhaust valves were all burnt.  I was asked how I 
had the valves/lifters adjusted and I replied, &quot;2 full turns past zero 
lash, just as Bently instructs for the hydraulics.&quot;  I was told that I 
should have adjusted the valves to one turn, as 2 turns &quot;will almost 
certainly cause this condition to happen.&quot;  The company said it could do 
the repair work... for $100/head!  Grrr... After some discussion, I got 
them to lower the price a bit.  My beef was: the company never 
instructed me to do this!  They claim that I should &quot;just know&quot;!

What's the deal here?  My (2nd) mechanic in Berkeley says this is a line 
of BS.  He claims to have rebuilt hundreds of VW engines and that if the 
valves are done right and hand-lapped, that two turns is fine.  He says 
that some rebuilders cut corners and then they recommend the valves be 
adjusted to one turn (or even zero lash for a short time) until the 
seats are &quot;broken in&quot;.

Is this for real?  I know there has been tons of discussion in the past 
revolving around &quot;how many turns are needed to adjust the hydraulics&quot;, 
but I didn't think following Bently would trash my engine!  What should 
I do here?  How do I avoid this in the future?
