On an upright engine, you have to remove the engine from the car, then pull
the cylinder heads to take the tubes out. The only other option is aluminum
expandable tubes, which can be installed on an assembled engine; getting
your old ones out is the toughest job. However, there is only ONE brand of
expandable tube that won't leak (that's all we carry).
