&gt; &gt; &gt; 20/50 might be the way to go, but I've run 40wt for years in the 2
&gt; &gt; &gt; liter with no ill effects.  In the very hot triple digit weather of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Northern Cal in August/September I even ran 50wt in my 80 Vanagon.
&gt;
&gt; In a sense an &quot;air cooled' engine is just as much an &quot;oil cooled&quot; engine.
&gt; These engines can get hot, and the Type 4 engines in particular don't like
&gt; that much. In my Type 4 engines I have generally run 20W50 in the
&gt; spring/winter/fall, and straight 40 weight in the summer (PA, often 85-90

&gt; functioning more like a 10 wt oil; hence the potential advantage of
&gt; straight-weight oil in climates where cold-weather starting is not an issue.

and where synthetics become a significant advantage since they are more
resistant to breakdown
