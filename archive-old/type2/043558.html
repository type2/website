Subject: Re: propane safety

&gt; Since the bottles are not to be exposed to temps higher then 120F, where 
&gt; do you store them?  Both for driving &amp; while in camp?  If I do get a large
&gt; bottle, the same question.  Where do you have the large bottle when you 
&gt; are cooking? 

I'm in the same boat (van, whatever...). I have the installed Westy stove
with underneath fuel tank, but I couldn't figure out where to get it fire
inspected and no one will fill it up without an inspection. So it just sits
there. I have a separate Coleman stove for camping. Sometimes I set it up on
the flip up counter right on top of the old one. Sometimes I set it up
outside on a table or something. Occasionally when the wind blows from weird
directions, I set it up in weird places. Right inside the way back is good.
You can cook out the back of the bus. 

My 2.5 gallon propane bottle rides on the roof rack above the driver's seat,
bungied down and sitting on a pad to keep it from scratching up the roofrack
too badly. I have an extension hose that reaches through the screen window of
the poptop and connects to the stove when it's on the countertop. If I had a
longer extension hose, I could reach to most anywhere I needed to go without
ever removing the bottle from the roof. They sell extension hoses at 
Camping World and lots of other places. For some odd reason, they are 
reverse threaded. 

BTW, my scene got a little bit less optimal when I replaced my canvas top.
The stock one allowed me to unzip the screen from the driver's side, opening
only a little gap to fit the hose through but keeping the screen in place for
bug protection. The new one (from The Bus Depot) is really nice, has cool
side windows that the old one never had, but the screen only unzips from the
passenger's side. Which means I have to open it all the way or else run my
hose way over and back to get through the mostly closed screen while cooking
on the counter top. I could make a neat little hole with a nice sewed edge
where I need it, but I am unlikely to get around to that soon. 

I would further note that my 2.5-gallon propane tank cost more than a 
5-gallon one would. I liked the size better, so I paid it. But relatively 
few of them are made and sold compared to the ubiquitous 5-gallon ones.

FWIW, I have carried a small canister in one of the way back cubby holes for
years with no problems. It's to get me through a meal if the big one ever
runs out. It is hard to measure the amount of fuel left in the bottles. Maybe
I'm teetering on the brink of disaster on hot sunny days. But I don't think
it ever gets 120 degrees in there even on a hot day. Anyone ever measured? 

Your actual mileage may vary.
