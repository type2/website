Subject: Re: [T2] 79 California FI acting up

&gt;
&gt; Take a can of Ether or Berrymsns B-12 and spray it around the locations
&gt; that draw vaccum and if the engine speeds up then you've found your leak.

Ditto, I had the same problem.  The frequent downshifting, loss of power,
jumpy take off, high idle.  I did the ether test, (used about 3/4 can by the
time I found all the leaks.  My van is a 76, 2000, California model so the
vaccuum hoses are probably the same.  My biggest culprits were the larger
hoses.  Also, check to make sure your vaccuum  advance hose is still
connected at the source.  That'll cause problems also.  Worse than a
009.You'll have to really get your head in there to find all leaks
Good luck
