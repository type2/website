Subject: RE: BA-6 Heater Relay Needed

&gt; Anyone parting out a later-model bay that once had the BA-6 heater, I'm
&gt; looking for a heater relay that I believe installs under the dash. This is
&gt; the only electrical part I'm missing from my BA-6 heater



I sell BA6 gas heater triple relays, brand new, for $54.95.  Part number 411
963 209B.  In my catalog and, I believe, on the website.
