Subject: Gas in oil, please help (long)

howdy list!

my bus is a '77 with a 2.0L hyd. lifter FI engine.

i checked my oil last night before heading home and was surprised to find
that it was higher than it was last time i checked it. i checked it again,
and a 3rd time, same thing. I smelled it: smells like gas. I felt it, feels
kinda thin.

started as normal, 1st try, oil lite went right out (or as quick as it
always does, it takes 1/2 - 1 sec. for hyd. lifter to pump up), trip home
was uneventful.

I read up on the subject in the archives when i got home. much of the stuff
in there was for upright motors with mech. fuel pumps that are leaking, or
carbs that have a float prob or something. i have electric pump and FI.

it seems as though gas in the oil is caused by: 1) running rich  2)failed or
poor spark  3)poor rings.  I doubt i have poor rings as the motor is an AVP
rebiuld with &lt;3000 miles on it. I will do a compression test to verify
but....   I also read the fuel will even leak past new (good) rings if it
has washed the oil out of the cylinder because it's so thin.

I changed the oil this morning (to get the gas out) and took it for a spin
round the neighborhood. bus seemed to lack its usual pep. for some reason i
suspect the timing has somehow been retarded and is causing incomplete
combustion, which lets the fuel past the rings. i don't know how timing was
retarded, b/c i have pertronix, but i can't check it with the strobe b/c my
little bro left it in his beetle (which has no roof) out in the rain without
the car cover on. so the strobe doesn't work no more.

I also pulled all the plugs and they looked like the &quot;normal&quot; picture in the
Haynes book.

so here come the questions:
1. will retarded timing lead to gas in the crankcase?
2. should i also test the cold start injector for leakage? (hasn't worked
since i've has the bus)
3. i should do a compression test with the engine warm, correct?
4. should i take the bus to the local inspection station to have the exhaust
gases measured?
5. can i tell if i have a rich mixture from the plugs? retarded timing??
they looked normal.
6. what else haven't i thought of??

thanks all for any input
