Subject: Re: [T2] engine stand from Bus Depot!!  Rant

I actually don't have the stand bolted together in the pictures. I just
have the upright set over the bolt. I have had it together and it
went fine. If you need me to take a close up of where it bolts together
let me know.  Do you still have the slip with the shipping weight
on it.

&gt; hello,
&gt;
&gt; how ironic that this thread happens to be current at
&gt; the time of my &quot;experiences&quot; with this product.
&gt;
&gt; i ordered the floor standing engine stand from bus
&gt; depot, picked up friday and tryed to assemble it this
&gt; morning. only to discover that that middle bracket
&gt; (observable in bill monk's pics) didnt match up. as
&gt; in, the holes do not line up!!!!!! what the !!??? this
&gt; is very disappointing. apparently bill's lined up, or
&gt; not, bill?
&gt;
&gt; am i missing something? input please. i seem to
&gt; remember someone on this list saying that they had
&gt; &quot;never been impressed by EMPI Products&quot; and i am now
&gt; beginning to see why!
&gt;  Have Fun (if possible)
