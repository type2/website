&gt; &gt;   Once a year I remove the clutch and accelerator cables for 
&gt; &gt;inspection, greasing, and replacement if needed.  That way I get to 
&gt; &gt;decide where and when I have to deal with them.  And of course I 
&gt; &gt;have spares on board, just in case.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the best grease/lubricant to use?

Probably synthetic, but I've always used plain old wheel bearing grease
with good results.
 
&gt; And while I am asking questions, exactly what part does the Bowden 
&gt; Tube play in the clutch system?

It provides the &quot;push&quot; to counter the cable's &quot;pull&quot;.  That way, the trans
can flex around without affecting the disengagement of the clutch.  If you
just tried to use a straight pull without the bowden tube, the clutch
would start to engage, which would push the rear of the tranny downward,
which would slightly disegage the clutch, which would cause the rear to
rise engaging the clutch and so on.  In short, it would chatter.
