I'm going to describe the Vanagon controls, from my '80, I presume
that the later ones are the same.

Top lever - Direction of hot air
Left=Floor
Right=Defrost

Middle lever - Amout of hot air
Left=No Heat from engine
Right=Heat from engine

Bottom lever - Fresh air from top black panel on front of bus
Left=No fresh (cold) air from dash vent to your face
Right=Fresh air from dash vent to your face

All to the Left=defrost, heat from engine, no fresh vent
For Heat to your feet= Top-left, middle-right, bottom-right

Too hot = move bottom two levers from right to left to let to reduce hot
air from engine to feet and increase cold air to face.

I REALLY like to be able to get cold air to face to keep me awake,
while at the same time keep my feet warm!

I hope you're right about the fresh air vent since it makes sense. On my 81 I
can tell that lever does something because there is a change in the air flow
noise but I can't actually turn off the cold air flow from the dash vents.
Now maybe I have a clue as to how it ought to work.

Now, if you also have the fan, exactly what is it meant to do? I've been
under the impression that it is supposed to act only as a ventilation fan and
not as a warm air fan. Could that be right?

Thanks,

Weston
