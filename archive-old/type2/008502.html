hi my names dave , and ive been driving a 72 van with a vertical bus motor
that was a 1600 that i had built into a 1776 ... it drives like a dream and no
it's not for sale.... but i know how to do it ... your going to loose 3
weekends on it but its worth it ... you get a early pre-pancake motor arm and
a pancake arm and bolt which ever one goes to the car to the car leave the arm
on the motor ...jack the motor rougly in place and where  the arm rougly
begans to roughly translate upward's on the body arm go back  from there 2 to
4 inches and cut there on both sides ... the same with the motor arm... the
idea is to give your self an area to bolt and later weld... use some motor
mount bolt's from the body there are three on each side  and there plenty
tough enough and in a pull yard there ususlly free!!! use two on each side
about two inches apart and one inch or so from from the outer edges where the
arms  peice's first meet ... make sure you weld the two arm peices with a deep
penterating weld like an arc-weld or beter,and the weld has to go all the way
around where the arms meet ... the tin is easy . once the back peice is in its
fairly straigh
 foward ... there is some bending and welding involved, but i goes farily fast
... in other words it will  take about a day of crawling or all over  you
motor

&gt; Ok, I sure this has been covered in the archives,but I can't find it
&gt; I believe someone offers the sheetmetal and engine support to put the
upright
&gt; into the 72 and later van (Like the european transporter)
&gt; Does anyone have that information handy?
&gt; Also, in the latest VWM mag from the UK they show a *new* Devon camper
&gt; Uses a *new* &quot;1973ish&quot; Mexican bus......(Link-pin front end..with disc
&gt; brakes!?!?)
&gt; Like, you can still *buy* a new bus...
&gt; Who had the vin plates for sale??
&gt; (only kidding, *I'd* get caught, sure as sunshine)

Steve:
They are probably Mexi-buses- basically 73-79 style with an 1800 Golf
water-cooled motor vertially mounted in back, and a Darth Vader-style
nose for the radiator. They perform well and are often seen in the
American southwest. VW de Mexico shows them on its website. $18-19,000,
not cheap enough to warrant interest in doing a &quot;jack up the VIN plate,
change the whole car routine&quot; like Beetlemex does with mexi-beetles.
Believe me, I'd consider using a chassis from one under my 69 double cab
if I could get one into Iowa legally. (I have often referred to my 69
double cab as &quot;the rustiest one still going to work every day&quot;. It's so
rusty underneath that the partition behind the front seats twangs
(oil-cans) driving over irregular surfaces.
