Subject: Sapphire radio install ???'s

Hi List!!
I purchased a new to me stock sapphire am/fm radio for my '72 campmobile. 
I'm looking at a black wire w/ an in-line fuse, a solid blue wire and the
(2) wires for the speakers.  Does this thing do a chassis ground through
the shell of the radio or what?  Or what exactly are the black and blue
wires for?? I looked in haynes and they don't even show the radio in thier
wiring diagrams.  Any advice on this matter would be super!!  Thanks in
advance!
Mark
