Subject: Re: [T2] '76 Camper 1800cc to '72 Transporter?

Hi BJ,

It'll work fine, but you should consider rejetting the carbs.

IIRC, the main jets used on the 1700's were 127s.  For the 1.8L carbs  
VW went to 130s, and for the 2L it was 132.5.

I'm not saying it won't work OK as-is, but it might run a bit lean if  
you increase the displacement without compensating with extra fuel.

Happy trails,

&gt; Dear Guru's,
&gt; In searching my local area for a used type 4 engine, I've found a '76
&gt; camper for sale. It has a 1800cc single carb (but is missing the carb,
&gt; but everything else is great). I've got a seized '72 1700cc with dual
&gt; carbs. The guy wants $350 for the engine or $500 for the car. In the
&gt; short term, I'd like to take the engine out of the '76, slap my carbs
&gt; from my 1700 on it and put it back in the '72.  Is there any reason
&gt; this won't work?
