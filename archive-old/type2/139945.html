Subject: Re: [T2] MB Westie

Yeah, having a NEW Westy with everything that works and A/C and power 
windows and power steering and ABS and gauges that tell you your true 
speed and how much gas you REALLY have...and your family can actually 
go up small hills without down-shifting 3 times is SUCH a bad thing.

/Grin

Nah...I'll pass. That BenzWesty has NO soul.

None.

Our 69 Westy certainly has a soul. Might be a damned soul, but it is 
there, nonetheless! A rusted soul...that's it.

I'll do a QT 3D of our new bus in the next week or so. Right now I am 
recovering from driving that beast in 20-30 mph winds for 300 miles.

&gt; Don't do it, Anton. Turn back toward the light.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe Ratwell will do a 360 quicktime of his bus. That's half the 
&gt; thrill of the MB site, anyway.
