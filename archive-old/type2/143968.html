Subject: Fun with carbs (never assume!)

My '71 lost its normally well-behaved idle, so I did some troubleshooting.

First to be checked was the dwell, as it hadn't been looked at in a while
and it might be that the points were closed up.  However, dwell and timing
were spot-on despite the distributor having been in service for several
years.

OK, if not the ignition, then the carb.  Pulled the carb off, recorded the
positions of the air and fuel screws (31PICT-4) and disassembled.  Sprayed
carb cleaner through all the passages.  Cleaned air cleaner and put in
fresh oil.  Reassembled everything and started bus up.  Idle was back to
normal!  Great!

Fast forward several hours.  Buddy calls and we decide to meet at a local
Mexican place.  Headed out and get a couple of  miles when the bus starts
to buck, spit and backfire.  Found a place to pull over
and the bus dies completely.  Said several blue words.

OK, carb is probably plugged again, perhaps I picked up some bad gas.
Pull carb,  No carb cleaner in bus, but do a quick teardown and blow
through all the jets and passages.  Reassemble and guess what, bus still
doesn't start!

OK, maybe a ignition problem.  Put dwell meter on coil and crank it over.
No indication at all from dwell meter.  Looked at wires more carefully and
found a spade connnector hanging loose from the coil.  Obviously, I
loosened it while working on the carb.  Said more blue words.  Plugged
connector back in and headed off for carne asada.

Moral of the story:  Don't assume that the last thing you worked on is the
current problem.  If I had been thinking straight I would have realized
that carb problems seldom result in backfires and would have zeroed in on
the real problem faster.

Carne Asada was delicious, BTW!
