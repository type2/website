Subject: tools needed in NC

Does any kind person in the Durham/Chapel hill/Pittsboro area have an 
exhaust analyzer they can let me hook up to long enough to set my mixture? I 
don't mind bringing you a six pack or something.  Or you could come over 
hang out go swimming.  I just really need to set my mixture properly.
Also, if anyone has a compression gauge, or whatever it is that I need to 
check for vacuum leaks I would appreciate it a lot if I could borrow it.  I 
know there cheap, but all my $ is going into regestering it.  Besides, I 
know I've seen a bunch of buses around my way lately.  Some of you must be 
out here.

Thanks,
Kyle
