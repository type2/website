&gt;Has anyone used any tents from Eurocampers?  What is your experiences

I have never used one. But, I have seen several of them at the most recent
High Country Bus Festival. People were enjoying them, and constantly
bragging about how small they pack. The Eurocampers guy was camped right
next to us, and he was a really nice guy. He had the rectangular style, but
said that the most popular and convenient was the round style. I inspected
his closely, and the quality of construction appeared incredibly high, at
least as good as an expensive backpacking tent. Everyone else I saw at the
campout had the round style, with the flexible poles (fiberglass?).

&gt; with them?  Would you recommend one of their tents?

I tried unsuccessfully to recommend one to my wife, But she likes our 80's
vintage A&amp;E awning.
