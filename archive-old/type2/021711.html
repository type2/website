Subject: Mystery-why did the oil leak stop?

Foillowing a 2-3 mi drive I reported that I had a drip per second or so
oil leak coming from about the oil filter.  It left a trail on our
blackdrop driveway of a spot every 5 feet.  Filter seemed hand tight,
but I cranked it a bit more with a wrench.
I asked about how easy it was to replace the oil cooler seals with
engine in.  Seems the effort is 50-50 engine out or in.
     Yesterday I had to do an hour trip and wired a roaster pan under
the oil filter to protect my driveway, topped up the level, and drove
off.  Not much in the pan when I got there, not much when I got back.
Total loss, about half a cup.
Today I drove it again about 3 mi and noticed that leak had stopped (no
drip per second).  What gives....could I have had a relief valve stick
that over pressured the cooler to leak its seals?  Could the cooler
mornings and the 40-50 wt oil in there have caused this?  I do have a
gauge I don't recall checking, but it usually is a bout 60 at startup.
