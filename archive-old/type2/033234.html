Subject: Re: Oh where oh where can my vacuum leak be

I had a leak in this area on a new engine I installed on my bus and it 
drove me crazy.  

I think the easiest and safest method for finding leaks is to pressurize 
the system with an air compressor and then use soapy water on all suspect 
areas, looking for bubbles.  I attach the compressor to the hose that 
runs into the aux air regulator (engine cold so the regulator is open), 
plugging the hole in the air intake elbow where I detached the hose.

&gt; What are the symptoms of a vacuum leak, and how do you find it if you cant
&gt; put your finger on it. The engine seems to run great, I can turn the key
&gt; and it cranks and idles without touching the gas and the one time I drove
&gt; it it ran good with no skips.  When I put my ear up close it seems like the
&gt; noise is coming from the intake distribution box (the round bubble like
&gt; thing inbetween the the intake manifolds).
