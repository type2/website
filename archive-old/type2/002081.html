chris:
it's always hard to visualize when info
is incomplete. you are correct, it should
not be necessary to drop both together,
except maybe for automatics, it helps
to have slope on the assembly, and
requires a helper...
i had assumed the oil filler was removed,
as well as the rear tin. even then it's a squeeze.

in this situation, since the intention is to get the
trans out, try this: leave the cv joints attached,
disconnect the shifter, remove the trans mount bolts,
lower the assembly and slide the engine out with
the trans supported, then remove the trans.
