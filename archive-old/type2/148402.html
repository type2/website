Subject: Re: [T2] westy light

I have a BLACK LIGHT fluorescent bulb in my Westy over-the-cabinet fixture.
The 8w fluorescent was fine, but since I added a pair of reading lights and
a night light right over the rear seat, I can afford to turn the black light
on and see absolutely no effect!!

Of course when I go prancing around in the Westy at night in my white
briefs, i can just imagine the sight that presents to the voyeurs outside.
I'll bet there are a lot of non-VW people wondering about me when they see
the dancing skivvies show..

(Of course, you VW'ers understand, right ? ? ?)

'Anymouse' sounds like the right name...  Let it be written, let it be
done..  (and Yentl asks 'where is it written . . .??')
