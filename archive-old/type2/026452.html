&gt;Also, I wonder why so many seem so anxious to buy new 
&gt;pistons and cylinders.  Unless worn out of specification or 
&gt;pitted to the whazoo I think people just like going to the FLAPS 
&gt;and asking for &quot;new P&amp;C's&quot; just to look cool.  I don't know.

On type 1 motors where a new P&amp;C set, complete with new rings and wrist
pins cost $85, there's no reason not to.  That's just cheap insurance.
But on type IV motors where the sets are $300 ($600 for 914 2.0 sets!),
make those babies work for lifetimes!
