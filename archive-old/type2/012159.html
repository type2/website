Get it back?  Ask them when the last time they sold a
car for even *half* what they paid for it.  In time,
you'll see that you won't &quot;get it back,&quot; but that's
only because you'll probably never sell it.  If mom &amp;
dad aren't putting money into it, they have nothing to
worry about.  Owning a VW will teach you the value of
simple engineering.  Heck, give me some bailing wire,
a pair of pliers and a stick of gum and almost
anything can be fixed in an emergency!  (Just a
joke...)

I have owned a number of cars, and the 'dubs are the
only ones I usually sell for about what I paid for
them.  Everything else goes for way below what I
paid...
