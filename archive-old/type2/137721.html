Hi Tom,

Individual personalities aside, any business model has to consider the
market value. Decent bays only seem to pull about $2000. Extensive
reconditioning usually doesn't add as much as what was put into it.
Westies and splitties seem to do better.

 Dr. Tim suggested this before. I believe the problem to be, we are all
 bargain hunters. Everyone is looking for the proverbial $200 bus with a
 great body. How many of us have $10,000 ready to peel off for a baywindow
 bus?
