Bill Trafton. I thought it was called Trafton Foreign Auto, but its:
Trafton &amp; Maier Foreign Service
15570 SE Stark St
Portland, OR 97233
(503) 253-4621

I haven't had him do anything on Hapy, though I'm planning on having
him do my front end (ball joints) when I can scrape the cabbage
together. I have spoken to him on the phone. He has given me 2 accurate
diagnoses over the phone for what my condition was without hearing the
engine - just on my descriptions. Free accurate advice for some bum on
the phone he doesn't know from Adam - me like. From the Portlanders
that I know, everyone has had very positive things to say about him. I
haven't heard one negative comment.

Good luck on whatever you need done,

&gt; Hi -
&gt; 
&gt; I have a question to pose to the folks in Portland, Oregon:  There is
&gt; a 
&gt; mechanic I've heard about who is supposed to do magic with VW's of
&gt; all 
&gt; kinds, and I cannot recall his name - it is something like Grafton, 
&gt; Safton or something like that.  I believe he has a shop somewhere 
&gt; between Portland and Gresham, but I'm not certain.  Anyone out there 
&gt; familiar with this guy?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
