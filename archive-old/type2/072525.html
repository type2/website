You are right, and it definetly sounds as if that couple got one hell of a deal!!! 
Speaking of KOAs, I will be traveling from California to Memphis Tennesee in November, camping along the way.....any list members out there??? I will be going via the 10 freeway, thru Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, and Mississipi. On the way back I will be going thru Arkansas, and Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona (Northern part), and then take a detour to Nevada, into Las Vegas. Do any list members know of any dangerous high mountains/roads to avoid out there?? How hot does it get in the desert in November?? Is it a good idea to take the 1973 bus, or should I go in the 1978 ??
TIA

Well, since you brought it up....went camping this past weekend at the KOA in 
Front Royal. When I found my assigned spot, couldn't believe it, but right 
across from me was an '89 Westy. No one was around, but a couple hours later 
the owners showed up. They just bought it a few months ago. It was in 
showroom condition. The owner said the plastic shrink wrap was still on the 
stove! The purchase price: $4,900.00!!! The one thing I found interesting: 
neither buyer nor seller is on the Internet. I asked they couple if they were 
aware of Vanagon_dot_com and they said they had heard of it, but really weren't 
into the Internet (retired folks, early 60's). My feeling is the Internet is 
helping to push prices up. You can still get one for a decent price, but not 
from someone on the net!    Jeff S.
