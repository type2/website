I had a GEX engine before it blew up.  It had the original number intact.

&gt; Hi Volks hope you all had happy holidaysand more to come as we press into
&gt; the New Year.
&gt; I know the GEX thread is old but i have found something that is puzzling.
In
&gt; previous threads about the GEX engines I read that GEX grinds the numbers
&gt; off the case. If so they may have missed one. I have GEX stickers on my
case
&gt; but i also have numbers too.
