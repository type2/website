Subject: 71 westy mis fire UPDATE

OK new coil is in and condenser, plugs are fine, wires, points, cap, rotor 
and she's still mis firing! AAAHHH. So I went through the wires puling them 
off as Libba is running, 1,2, and 4 pulled and change in idling, but no 
change when three is pulled..... tried other wires just to make absolute 
sure, but no luck in getting three to fire. So why wouldn't three be 
firing??I have the distributor out to see what condition that was in,, how do 
I know if it's fine....by jiggling back and forth looking for play? There's 
no movement back and forth but there is a little up and down but that's 
normal isn't it? One thing I did notice when adjusting the valves stone cold 
was a small broken hard plastic o ring in 3/4 valve cover. Oh also it almost 
seems to run a hair bit better if I just leave the three wire off.

I'm at a lost here and trying to keep it out of the shop if I can help it.


Thanks, Andy
