Subject: Re: [T2] replacing windsheld and rubber together?

I have seen nice restorations with new glass. A nice touch. You won't know 
how bad the original glass was until you see new glass. 20 years of dust 
and grime and grit - rubbed in with the wipers.

If you don't decide to put new glass in - it will just cost you a new seal 
later (and maybe labor if you don't do it yourself).

My wife and I installed our windshield (old one) in the driveway with 
silicone spray lube and string. We also repaired the rust in the driveway 
with sandpaper, metal impregnated body filler, and primer (I had somebody 
else paint it).



&gt;Hi, folks:
&gt;
&gt;I've got some leaking going on this winter around the windshield of my 
&gt;1970. The rubber is pretty seriously cracked and dried, but the original 
&gt;glass itself seems in good shape: one little nick and the usual amount of 
&gt;wiper etching.
&gt;
&gt;Here's my question: Putting aside cost questions [for the moment!], does 
&gt;it make sense to replace the rubber without replacing the glass? Or is 
&gt;that being penny wise and pound foolish--is it better just to replace them 
&gt;both at the same time and be done with it?
&gt;
&gt;FWIW, I'd almost certainly have the work done; I don't have the place or 
&gt;help [or inclination] to take it on myself.

Ciao!
