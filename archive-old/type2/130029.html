&gt;But David, is the resulting vehicle a &quot;bus&quot;? That's the question. Seems to

I already answered that question in my previous post.  Just so there's no 
ambiguity, if a yes or no answer is required I believe the answer is &quot;yes&quot;.

&gt;When you buy a bus, you sign on to the limitations of the thing.

I didn't sign anything.

&gt;  Swapping in a watercooled engine isn't like installing a Pertronix. It's 
&gt; a decision (IMHO) that you don't really want a bus.

I disagree.  There are people who are so anal that they don't advocate ANY 
non-stock items at all *cough*TPStephens*cough*.  I will assume you're not 
in that vintage-n*zi camp, but you're somewhere to the right of where I am, 
which is somewhere to the right of the people who would put a radiator in 
place of their engine hatch.  We're all on the large sliding-scale of 
bus-conservatism, and each entitled to hold our position where we please 
without open expressions of resentment from our peers, which do nothing but 
create bad blood in the bus community.

&gt;Anyway, I am getting worried now that two of the most senior and sensible 
&gt;members of the list -- not to mention the fact that they are list admins 
&gt;-- think that these conversions are a good idea.

And I'm getting worried about the lack of tolerance shown by other senior 
and sensible members of the list on certain topics.
