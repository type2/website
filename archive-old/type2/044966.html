&gt;     I recently had to remove the rear axle nut off my '74 Bug, got a 36 mm 
&gt; socket and put it on my Craftsman 1/2 inch drive, and using a 3' pipe as a 
&gt; breaker bar proceeded to break the Craftsman drive.

Whoever makes 36mm sockets in 1/2 inch drive should be shot!  If you're
buying these big sockets, make sure to get 3/4 drive!

Even free replacement tools cost you the time to return the broken tool to
the store, as well as your busted knuckles!
