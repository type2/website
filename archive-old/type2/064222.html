Subject: More Electrical Stuff...

Hey!

I replaced the emergency flasher switch and so far it seems to have
corrected my fuse #2 blowing problem.

My next questions...

I picked up a copy of the Bentley &quot;Official&quot; Service Manual.  In working
on my fuse box, I discovered that my fuse box maps to the 1971
electrical specs.  All along (2 months now) that I've owned the bus, I
thought is was a 70.  The title from the previous owner listed the bus
as a 1970.  So I'm confused.  Especially since the chasis numbers listed
in the front of the Bentley manual indicate I have a '70.  What gives?

That being the case (a '71 electrical system), which fuses should be 8
amps and which should be 16???  The previous owner had all of them 25. 
Soon after buying it, I replaced all with 8 amps based on Muir and not
knowing which should be 16...The Bentley has a diagram showing fuses 9
and 11 as 16 amp but notes that &quot;the location of 16amp fuses varies by
model year&quot;...so what does that mean to me???

I sent an e-mail to the VW online site to get some info from them to
help clear up my dilemma!
