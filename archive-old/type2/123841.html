Subject: [T2] re: fuel sender woes

&gt; Very nice, but one question...

I concur, very nice! But....!!

I more often find myself having to change the rubber elbow that connects the 
gas tank to the overflow tube on the filler neck. I'd like to see a larger 
access panel that allows access to that too!
