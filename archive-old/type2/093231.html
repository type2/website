Subject: '72 Safare for sale!  Dallas area

This sounds like a really nice bus.  I haven't seen it yet but here are the 
details:

1971 Safare Custom Camper (this would be one of the first Safare's made)
Light blue with highroof
Sink/Stove/Fridge standard Safare layout (see my owners manual for pictures 
http://www.type2_dot_com/des/vw/bluto/manual/)
Rebuilt &quot;Strictly Foreign&quot; 1776 engine with 7k miles
California bus - no cancer but some light surface rust around bumpers, etc..
Price is $3,500 O.B.O.
Call 214-623-8633

These busses are rare, especially outside of California.  By my estimate 
there were less than 1,500 Safare campers made and of those only a fraction 
are still on the road.  I would be willing to go check out this bus in 
person if anyone is seriously interested - it is about 25 miles from my house.
