Ummm, methane is a flammable hydrocarbon, the primary component in natural
gas.  Chemically, it is CH4.  It's boiling point is way too low for this
application, so I'll bet that this Red Tech is still a propane/butane mix.
You could say that butane/propane is a derivative of methane, as it just
strings together more carbon atoms at the expense of hydrogens.

Propane is also a flammable hydrocarbon, C3H8
Butane, ditto, C4H10

The funny thing is that Freon was invented as a non-flammable alternative
to hydrocarbon refrigerants that had been in use for years.

Frankly, I'd be a lot more worried about the 15 gallons of C8H18 that you
are carrying around to feed the engine than I would be of a pound of
propane/butane mix in an air conditioning system.  Of course, DuPont and
the government would much rather you spring for the 134a.
