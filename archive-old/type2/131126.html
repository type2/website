Subject: RE: [T2] Re: child seat/seat belt

Wow!  That's pretty cool.  I wonder if it's possible to do something like 
that (buy the plastic pieces) to my 70 Riviera.  I'm concerned it would hurt 
the fake-wood/veneer cabinet but I like knowing my mind was on the right 
track cause I pictured doing something just like that.  I'll save your info, 
thanks a lot!
