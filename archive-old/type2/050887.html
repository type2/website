Subject: [T2] emergency brake broke

I was coming home yesterday and was almost to my house when i downshifted 
into 2nd gear a few yards before my turn. When I let the clutch back out to 
start slowing down, I heard a loud &quot;Pop&quot; followed by some other bad noises. 
It sounded like something horrible happened to the rear wheels, but it was 
still driving fine. I got home and parked my bus, put it in first and pulled 
the emergency brake, and it just kept coming until it was fully pulled. I 
proceeded to crawl underneath thinking the cables had broken but everything 
was in tacked. I was wondering if this has happened to anyone before, I hate 
to break open the rear wheel drums and not be able to fix it until i can 
order parts (last time I broke 3 socket wrenches trying to get the axle nut 
off and ended up using a 2 foot pipe wrench and a 4 foot cheater bar). So 
any ideas what parts I will need to replace? or did something just slip 
loose? I would like to have an idea of what happened before opening it up.

Thanks in advance,
Nathan 74 Bus
