Subject: IRC

Volks,

Just to re-propose this...  Since security concerns have shut down the IRC
server on type2_dot_com, and since some of us really miss it, and since Chris
(ncbus) Cybulski has come up with a new site....

The general gathering place is now:

irc.mit_dot_edu
channel #buslist

I am there now and we hope to keep the channel active every evening.  I
don't know to what extent I will be able to show, but it would be great if
there were a place to discuss all the non-bus stuff we all want to post,
but that is not really appropriate, not to mention bounce our ideas
around before we go working on our buses.

                           Steve Dolan
