Subject: Re: [T2] what is that noise???? noise 1

Could be. Do you drive your van regularly?

Sometimes the light surface rust that builds up on the rotors when a 
vehicle is parked will cause this.

Also the brake pads moving around a bit will rub the caliper a certain way.

They make a grease that you can put between the caliper and the pad and 
silence some of this noise.

Car Talk actually had a caller with the same question this weekend.

You can listen at cars_dot_cartalk_dot_com

Sometimes some real information there, most of the time just entertainment.

You could bleed those calipers and maybe help the situation. Mechanically I 
can't think of a single reason air in the system would contribute to this 
problem but go for it. A little extra maintenance never hurt.


&gt;could be
&gt;I put on new calipers about 11 months ago
&gt;due I just need to &quot;bleed&quot; them???
