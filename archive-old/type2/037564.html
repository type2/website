Subject: FS: 1975 Westfalia in central Michigan

As I've noted in the past, I no longer really have time to take proper
care of my van, so I reluctantly have to part with it.  The van is
currently located at my parents' house in Alma, Michigan (15 miles south
of Mt. Pleasant.)

The details:

1975 Westfalia Campmobile.  Total milage unknown, due to the 'broken
odometer gear' problem (since fixed.)  1977 2.0L Type IV solid lifter
rebuild installed approximately 50,000 miles ago.  The engine currently
has a Weber 32/36 progressive carburator, and gets around 19 mpg highway. 
The fuel injection components have all been preserved in a cardboard box
and go with the van.  (I believe the ECU is dead.)  The camper interior is
complete (except for the child's cot and jumpseat) and everything works. A
working Stewart-Warner gasoline heater is installed behind the sink
cabinet.  The exhaust system except for the muffler has all been replaced
with rust-free components off a Southern bus.

Known problems:

- Exhaust leaks at the heads.  It needs new exhaust studs, which I've been
  unable to locate locally.  The new exhaust components are in excellent
  shape, so new studs and a little work should tighten the system up
  nicely.  To the best of my knowledge, none of the holes are stripped.
- A few pushrod tube seals are leaking fairly badly.  Not a difficult job,
  but one I haven't had time for.
- Fairly extensive rust on the sliding door, and some collision damage to
  the nose.  Other miscellaneous body dings.  The frame appears rust-free
  and straight, however.  The damage is basically cosmetic.
- Cracked front tranny mount, at the bottom nose cone bolt.  It's been
  that way as long as I've owned the van, with no apparent ill effects.

Asking price is $1,600 OBO.  Any specific questions can be emailed to me;
if you'd like to look at the van or test drive it, call my father at
517/463-2648.
