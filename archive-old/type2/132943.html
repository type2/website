Subject: 1970 Type II Body no engine available for free

Hi, I'm in Northern California and have a 1970 Type II passenger bus that is
about to go to the wrecking yard if I can't find a better home for it. The
body is straight, but the paint is not the best. All the glass is good. There is
no engine &amp; I'm not sure about the transaxle (it was working when I parked it
in my backyard 15 yrs ago.
The bus is free for the taking. I have the pink slip for it, so the title is
clear. Please pass this information on if you know of any list that may
benefit from it. Thanks, Harry
