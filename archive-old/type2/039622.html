check your throttle linkages

&gt; correct?  Or should I replace them with some sturdier

sturdy vaccuum lines are better but not really required, air tight is
essential

&gt; rubber tubing?  Also after removing a fuel injector,
&gt; there was a bit of crud in them, looked like sand, but
&gt; hard to tell.  Is there a method I should use to try
&gt; and clean them?  One other question.  Are there any

yes run the engine with some injector cleaner in the fuel tank the engine
has sat for a while if you haven't drain the tank and use fresh gas

&gt; members out there that have switched from fuel
&gt; injection to carberators?  I've just never had to deal

I have always said that if you are not an expert in this area stick with
what the engine was designed to use....if it was FI keep it FI if carbs
stick with em..  and no matter what you do DON'T throw anything away

&gt; with fuel injection before and it has me a bit lost. 

learn the system it is easier than swapping the systems, FI is not that
complicated just doesn't have a lot of &quot;fiddle knobs&quot; where you can play
with em....so you feel more frustrated just looking at meters and test
lights
