Subject: Re: [T2] missing heat pieces, and questions

&amp;gt;  First, I don't have the little non-return flap things
&amp;gt;(http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/Heating/10-FanShroudFlaps.jpg).

Wow, these little flaps are really necessary. Without these flaps installed, 
when your fan was working and your engine was off, the heated air could be 
duct as a reverse airflow back into the fan shroud, there by reducing the 
heated air flow to the passenger compartment and 'back flushing' the heated 
air thru the fan shroud to the engine.

But wait.  If the engine is off, then where does the air get the heat??
