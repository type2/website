Subject: 'drives like a boat'

&gt;When driving at Highway speeds, the van has started steering herself, feels
&gt;like driving a boat.  You can maintain a lane ok, but it's kind of a wave
&gt;to the left, then right, then left, then right, the whole way.

Oh yes, a wave to the right, a wave to the left.  I am there with you on
that one.  Last January when I first brought Hildegarde up from Florida to
Wisconsin I got pulled over two times in one evening for drunk driving!
Turns out in Georgia they have these lovely signs all along the interstates
to encourage people with cellular phones to &quot;turn in&quot; drunk drivers by
calling the highway patrol.  It was really annoying to have to get out in
the cold (relative to Florida anyway) and explain the wind resistance of VW
busses to impatient and ignorant patrolmen.  Ignorant only in the way that
just becuase we are weaving a little bit doesn't mean we're drunk.
Thankfully they could tell that I wasn't when I got out, although I bet I
did look funny what with my half-numb feet!
