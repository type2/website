&gt; cheapo brand X machine. Also if you are going to buy a mig I always
&gt; reccomend buying one that is bigger than what you need. Due to the fact they
&gt; have more finer adjustments and once you learn how to weld with it , you
&gt; will find more and more projects to weld and wish you had went for the
&gt; bigger machine. Also go with a 220 volt unit and a good 220 supply (I put in
&gt; a new 6ga. supply line to my garage just for my welders). The 110 volt units
&gt; are ok with a good power source but most 110 feeds are too small of wire to
&gt; supply a mig welder with the power (line voltage fluxuations) it needs to
&gt; produce a nice weld. My Lincoln 170 is good up to about 1/4&quot;+ depending and

I bought the Lincoln 100 a small mig welder that will run on 120 and it
has served me well, since I didn't have any power in the garage I just
bought a generator big enough to operate the welder...don't usually have
anything else going when the welder is being used so the full power oof
the generator is avaliable for the arc...

killed two birds at the same time, limited funds and I needed the
generator too for some other things(it sure came in handy this week with
no power here in the Northeast)
