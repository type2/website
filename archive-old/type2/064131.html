(I'm sending this to the Vanagon list also, since a lot of you have roots in
the old air-cooled VW's)

  Farmer Jones looked sadly at his old truck. It had served him well these last
12 years, since he bought it new in '62. He had used it all over the farm,
hauling various supplies around, and with the back seat, he could take the
family into town when he went.
Yep, he sure had enjoyed that truck, even though some folks said it was
funny-looking. He washed it faithfully, and kept it tuned up. But, time was
beginning to tell on it. It hadn't been running right lately, and he needed
something heavier to tow his trailers. So, with sadness, he parked it in the
barn, until he could fix it one day.
  Jenny loved her Beetle, even though that split in the rear window sometimes
interfered with her view. It had served her well through college and medical
school, but lately it hadn't been running smoothly. Besides, she was working at
the hospital now, and she was parking next to all the Mercedes's and BMW's.
But, she knew she could never get rid of it, so she parked it at her parent's
house, until she could restore it.
 This one's true-
  My girlfriend drove my '67 to her dentist appointment, and the dentist made a
remark about it. When she went back for a followup visit, she was wearing my
stylish Vanagon_at_Lenti t-shirt, and they had a conversation about all the old
VW's he had out at his farm. We weaseled a visit, and went out there last
Saturday. In addition to all the dead and dying Fords, and Dodges, there was a
nice '70 Westfalia, as well as 3 60's Bugs and a Super Beetle. All had been
well maintained, until his kids decided they wanted to &quot;move up&quot; in the world.
Heck, even the oil was clean!
  All these are opportunities for the Air Cooled Search and Rescue Team. Some
of you are already members, without knowing it. It's the concept of fellow
Listmember Bob Hufford, a rescuer himself. We've all driven down a back road at
some time, and seen the familiar friendly shape of a splitty or Bug, and wished
we could give it a good home. Many of us even do try to give it a good home, or
at least pass it along to someone else who will love it and treat it right.
  They aren't making any more of them, and it's such a shame to see the ones
still around falling to pieces. We must do what we can to save them all. Bring
them into your driveways! Never mind what the wife/husband/kids will say. Never
mind the neighbors- they probably already think you're crazy!
  As I love to write these lovely episodes for you, I shall probably post ACS&amp;R
Team reports as things happen with the Dentist Stash. I'm also rescuing a '68
crewcab from another of our infamous listmembers, who has been lured to the Wet
Side. So let's keep those rescues happening! Long live the Air Cooled flat 4!
 (I must also confess that  I'm making up t-shirts for the Air Cooled Search
and Rescue Team, so I'd love to sell you one! (or two) They'll be truly spiffy,
in my fine (I hope) tradition. Bob Hufford will be selling them as well, as
I've suckered him into buying up a good number, so that it would even be
possible in the first place. I must also give him credit, for putting into
words the concept and spirit of which we're all a part.)
Anyway, stay tuned for the upcoming adventures of the ACS&amp;R Team!
Happy Friday
