&gt;On the oil pressure gauge - I suggest a dual sender so you retain 
&gt;the idiot light but also have the gauge.
&gt;
&gt;You can check http://aircraft-spruce_dot_com/main.html
&gt;
&gt;for some great dual gauges - gauges with dual indicator needles - 
&gt;oil temp + oil pressure or whatever combo you might dream about. 
&gt;Twice the info in the same amount of space.

I went to the aircraft-spruce web site and they have some neat stuff. 
I was intrigued by a tachometer they carry:

----------------

&quot;TINY TACH TACHOMETER/HOUR METER

An affordable, accurate, self-contained hour/tachometer. Displays RPM 
while engine is running &amp; total engine time when the engine is off. 
Unit is waterproof, shock-resistant, &amp; has built-in battery that 
lasts up to 8 yrs. Tiny Tach can be mounted using 2 mounting tabs or 
double sided tape. $42.40&quot;

----------------

I was thinking that the total engine hour feature when used in 
conjunction with miles. Here in the city I spend time idling at 
traffic lights, sure they are not hard hours on the engine, but they 
do add up. Probably not something high on a priority list. Thoughts 
from you engineers, is an hour meter worth it in an automobile 
application?

Now the Tiny Tach unit looks pretty small so I did a web search and 
discovered that VDO sells an hour meter. There are number of on-line 
vendors who carry VDO gauges, but Bus Depot still seems to have the 
best prices for oil, tach and volt units.
