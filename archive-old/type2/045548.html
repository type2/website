Subject: re: [T2] Help, just bought my first bus

Your '74 westy was equipped with dual carbs originally. I've seen lots
of these converted to a single carb, I guess because parts for the older
dual carbs are hard to find, and a single carb is easier to deal with
than duals for most folks.

I don't think you should have a problem because of this, but someday you
might want to put duals back on (not necessarily OEM) for the extra HP
and fuel economy...

As for the fridge, if I'm not mistaken, it runs off of 12v, 120vac, or
propane. If you can't get it to work from any of these, then you need to
fix the fridge.
