&gt; What is axle beam rot? How do you detect, and fix it?

As you may know; cars are biodegradable. Leave them out in the open for a
while and magically they will start to disappear.
This property is greatly enhanced by dirt, water and road-salt. Now some of
us don't like this so we tend to fight it.

One area of concern is the front axle beam. The degrading proces (commonly
called rusting) eats away at certain parts, often the 'flanges', and causes
the axle to be unsafe. You probably don't want that either. If that happens
you need to find another one, welding is often not possible or not allowed.
Swapping an axle beam is a bit of heavy work (the axle is big and heavy) but
many have done it. I hade one case where it needed to be done (welding had
been undertaken but not been appoved). I opted to 'find' the beam myself
(junkyard) but had the work done for me as I figured I did not have the
time, tools and muscle power needed.
