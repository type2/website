&gt; Many of you may not be aware, but in North America you have a better chance

&gt; DC. The 72-79 pick-ups were never brought into North America, due to
&gt; regulatory reasons. So where is the best place to search for one? Mexico,
&gt; UK, etc...

I believe that they were also imported to Canada, which is where most of
the bay pickups in the US came from.

Stupid chicken war...
