Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

Hi Folks,

Here in the mountains of Colorado they only do the tailpipe test, and I 
managed to pass my 79 Westy by changing the fuel/air mixture.  I drove it on 
the highway for 15-20 min to get it hot, then parked it a block away from 
the inspection station.  I leaned out the mixture with the AFM screw until 
it barely ran, drove it down the block, and it passed with flying colors.  
The inspection guy even said, &quot;Wow, I've never seen a VW that runs so 
clean.&quot;  I paid him, drove on, reset the mixture, and have had no worries.  
Granted, I'm not being very environmentally friendly, but now I'm rebuilding 
my engine, so my Bus is currently a Zero-Emissions vehicle.

Good luck to all who have to pass more stringent emissions tests...

Jason
