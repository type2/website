Subject: Painting wheels with POR

This is such a basic question it doesn't look like anyone has ever asked it
before...

How well does POR apply with a brush ? Is it a nightmare for brushmarks ?
Is the colour UV resistant ?

The story is: Last year I replaced all the tyres on Ashley. At the same
time I had the wheels sandblasted. I then treated them with Loctite rust
converter to be on the safe side. Each wheel was sprayed with Smoothrite.
After 6 months I have mild surface rust on most wheels :-((

We don't have POR readily available in the UK but a catalogue offering it
dropped through the letterbox last night. Having read how marvellous it is
here so many times, I wondered if it might be the solution to my wheel
problem. I don't want to take the tyres off, don't own a suitable spraygun
so if I use it, it will have to be by brush. I'm pretty good with the brush
though so it doesn't worry me.

Oh, and I can't get anything powdercoated locally either so this isn't an
option.

Thanks for the help. Any other wheel painting suggestions appreciated. No
chrome though, I'm not kewel enough for this :-)

Phil
