&gt; What could be simpler? There is only one screw to adjust. The Bentley
&gt; says turn it clockwise till idle drops off and than turn it
&gt; counterclockwise until the motor reaches its highest obtainable idle.
&gt; Then adjust the idle screw on the arm to get it back to about 850 rpm.
&gt;
&gt; Here is the question. What is the screw doing ? Is it allowing more
&gt; air to mix with fuel or more fuel to mix with air or is it increasing
&gt; a the volume of a predetermined air fuel mix to the idle circuit?

The 3rd choice. The idle circuit is a air/fuel mixture. It has its own fuel
jet
and air supply.

&gt;To
&gt; put it another way, is turning the screw in one way or another
&gt; richening or leaning out the mixture?

In [clockwise] is lean. The tip of the point on the end of the screw is
slowly
filling the hole, cutting off the air/fuel going into the venturi.

Out [counter-clockwise] richens it.

&gt;Also it this only  in effect at
&gt; idle or throughout the RPM range?

Mainly only at idle but faintly there with the throttle open.

&gt;
&gt; I adjusted mine per the Bentley and now I have a flat spot which was
&gt; not there before.

You may have a problem with the accelerator pump = not enough of a stroke
which
gives less fuel or the little jet may be plugged or the little jet may have
fallen out or it may be aimed wrong, to the center and not to the edge of
the
throttle plate just as it opens.
