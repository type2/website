&lt;&lt; I would need to see fact based reports on that...all I have heard about

those types of products is near urban legend status from doing numerous

internet searches...I am sure applying armor-all to your dash or vinyl top

on a weekly basis is liable to do more damage via UV rays then say applying

it once or twice a year. I think maybe we are talking a case of over

use/abuse of the product. If you are going to apply it that liberally and as

often it would be good to switch to something with UV protection like 303

Aerospace Protectant.


Just my two cents based on 15 years of detailing cars....

 &gt;&gt;
 From two other old car lists: Armor-all's heroin to plastics...There's a sol-
vent in the formula (that's what gives you that just bought shine) but after
a while it evaporates and needs more Armor-all and more and more...YMMV,
but...
