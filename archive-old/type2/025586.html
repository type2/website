I agree with Jim Arnott's suggestion, but a lose temperature sensor is not
the only potential source of your problem, although it's certainly one of
the easier ones to check.
You may also want to check every other electrical connector. One way to do
it is to let the engine idle while you're fiddlin' in the engine bay,
tugging and pulling on all parts of the large wire harness. If a tug kills
the engine, you will have found (one of) your lose connector(s).
For a more systematic approach, take a look at the HTML-based FI
troubleshooter on my website.
Good luck!
Sami
