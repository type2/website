Subject: adhesive for rubber trim , and sink/cabinet info
Message-Id: &lt;199905272154.OAA06998_at_coopext_dot_cahe.wsu_dot_edu&gt;

Hello, I have a 70 westy popup camper bus ( redundant? :-) ) on which the
inside rubber trim around the top wood part near the popup is coming off.
Thge outside rubber &quot;trim&quot; around the actual poptop is also coming off.
What kind of adhesive could I use, or other idea, for ra attaching it?
Thanks in advance.
Also, I recently found a sink/cabinet  for a westfalia that was tossed.  It
still had the cooler part, tank, and sink, and faucet, thought the faucet
leaks a bit.
I already have one in my bus.  Can anyone tell me what this would be worth,
or if someone is interested in buying it?
Thanks! Wes Taylor
