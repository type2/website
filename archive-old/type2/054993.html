Volks, 

I just called the guy on this one and he is just trying to get rid of it.
I have it reserved, but have a problem....  I am in Virginia! 

I will be heading west again next June and would truly appreciate it if
someone in the portland area could look at it.  According to the owner it
is *not* a VW rack, but a home-brew accesory.  It did sound like it would
be useful to me,tho.  Further, if whoever volunteers to look could also
store it 'til next June then I would be extatic!  If that is not possible,
if you could bring it to a shipping point, that would also be good.  My
desire is to have a rack that I can bring big parts back to the east coast
&gt;from those fabulous west coast junk yards :-)  You would of course, have
the use of it until I get out there.

Any volunteers???
