Subject: Re: [T2] Cam Question

Hi George,

I think you have a severely worn or broken camshaft on your hands.  
Have you measured the respective depths of the lifters in the bore?  
If the troublesome lifter is riding lower than the others or does not  
rise as high then the problem is with it or the camshaft.

Here's a source for a magnet that should be able to get a grip on the  
lifter:

Once you get that lifter out you will know whether you are going to  
have to split the case.

Happy trails,

Arnaud, all the push rods are the same length; none are bent as they  
all roll evenly. When everything is in place, however, it's as if the  
rod is too short.

I pull the head, and when I look at the lifters in the block, the  
exhaust side recedes into the block about 1/4 inch behind the intake  
side. What you're saying is that they don't touch the lobe when in  
that position. It seems that they should be even in order to push the  
rods into the correct position to adjust the valve....

The valves are closed when adjusting at TDC. The adjustment screw is  
all the way in...but... too loose a valve to run properly.

The valves are all seated properly. Bolts torqued according to the  
sequence in Bently.

Jamie, is there a way to pull the lifters out of the block? I tried  
with a magnet, buit they won't come all the way out. Then I can  
measure the cam lobes, right?

&quot;the adjusting screw way in on the rocker arm and it won't contact  
the valve head....? &quot; That's it.

It's pre hydraulic valves-'76'.....

The valves and the head are fine. What I'm seeing is that the lifters  
aren't even when at TDC. Aren't the valves supposed to be both closed  
at that point? So the lifters should be even in the shaft?
