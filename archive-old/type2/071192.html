Hello-
This is my first request to the type2 site.  I am as much of a beginner as 
one could be.  I just bought a beautiful baby blue 72 bus.  I drove it three 
times without problem.  Yesterday, I wanted to take a friend for a ride, but 
the emergency brake has all of a sudden locked up the right wheel.  I checked
the archives and found several posts with the same problem.  The solution 
seemed to be to release the brake and then tap on the axle with 1-3 lb sledge
hammer.  This is not working for me.  I have tried tapping on the axle, the 
wheel itself, and the inside of the drum underneath to no avail.  I also 
tried to gently rock the bus back and forth to brake it loose, but the thing 
won't budge.  This is becoming quite depressing.  The first job I had planned
was to redo/inspect the entire braking system.  Now that's definitely the 
plan.  Does anyone have any other suggestions?  How hard does the axle need 
to be hit?
Thanks for any help!!!!!!!!!!
