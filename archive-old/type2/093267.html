Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Engine oil leak stuck in Ohio update


&gt;If the bolt won't come up to 15 foot-pounds then something is wrong inside
&gt;the case that can only be fixed by tearing the engine down.  If that's the
&gt;case and you still have to drive the car, then buy a couple of cases of
&gt;cheap oil and check the oil level every 30 minutes or so.

If you cannot seal the leak - just keep a case of oil with you and keep 
feeding the engine. I came back from VA to TN in my Type IV powered Beetle 
and I was missing the bolt for the thermostat cable pulley. That is a whole 
bolt hole leaking oil. Never could find the leak.

Used a case and a half I think of oil.
