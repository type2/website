And make SURE that its a VW or equivalent gland nut.

The gland nut is made softer than the crank so if overtorqued the gland
nut deforms, if you get a high strenth CHRO-MOLLY gland nut and overtorque
it, it will strip out the end of your crank.

This is not a place to put in a stronger than stock fastener!

take care,
