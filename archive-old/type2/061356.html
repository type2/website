Subject: RE: Cooling and Heating

&gt;Question #1The fan housing of my 75 bus is missing the two 
&gt;Air non-return flaps that are located in the lower half.  When the 
&gt;motor was installed, I attempted to find a source for them but 
&gt;was unsuccessful.  My question is, anyone know where I can 
&gt;get them, and that do they do?

They keep hot air from rising back up through the fan housing and into
the engine when the motor is shut off.  

It's also possible (but not confirmed) that at idle with the auxiliary
heater fan on that the aux fan may provide enough force to close the fan
shroud flaps, thereby providing additional air volume to the cylinders.

Also, any of you folks running type IV motors without heater boxes
attached to the fan housing need to seal those flaps shut.  Otherwise
you're loosing valuable cooling air.

I don't know of any source for new ones, but I'd think used ones could
be had fairly easily.  Any of you parts-horders out there got a pair you
could spare for him?
