Subject: Re: [T2] 84 vanagon?

Hello Guys   This is coming from a guy who drives splitties and vanagons  The 
vanagons have a lot more room and are very comfy to drive. There is a cure 
for their water problems  Sabura coolant treatment , Subus are having their 
cooling problems also and this coolant treatment has even stopped a head gasket 
that was leaking  This isnt like bars leak or any other leak treatment that I 
have seen in working on cars for over 3o years. Can only be gotten at Subu 
dealers  part # soa635071   They might not want you to know about it as it would be 
ammitting that there is a coolant problem with subus   I like my vanagons 
very much  the syco has over 300K on it and my wolfsburg 88 has over 150K   later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing
