There were two gauges, one that shows CAT, EGR and one that displayes CAT,
OXS. The latter one is more &quot;accurate&quot;.

The lights are reset by the box halfway down the speedo cable. It triggers
the light every 15,000 miles as a service reminder (remember oxygen sensors
don't last forever). The owners manual say it wasn't connected in Canadian
models (not sure if this is true because my panel has none of these lights).

You have to look at the wiring diagrams because it varied from model to
model.

- for 79, it says the OXS warning light is activated by the OXS switch.

- for 77/78, the CAT warning light is activated by the EGR elapsed mileage
switch. (This implies the EGR light no has bulb).

- for 76, there are two switches in the elapsed mileage odometer, one for
CAT and one for EGR. I believe there is only 1 reset switch so they both go
off at the same time?
