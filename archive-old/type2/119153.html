Subject: Re:[T2]Oil filler tube leak - 72 Westy

Thank you David!
I sent the address by private email
I'll be making a $25.00 donation to the list

I don't get to read all the posts all the time, and I don't get to
contribute much at all
but when I need help the list is always there.

Thanks to all who make it great!

Thanks !

&gt; Hello Mike,
&gt; I have a good oil filler tube from my old 73 bus
&gt; engine some where boxed up. Give me your address and I
&gt; will send it to you the first chance I get. I don't
&gt; remember if I still have the plastic top and cap for
&gt; it or not. If I do I will send those as well. I don't
&gt; want anything for it but if you would like, paypal or
&gt; send a $5.00 donation to the type 2 list and I will
&gt; mail it to you A.S.A.P.
