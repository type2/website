Subject: 74' power in a 70'

Anyone care to comment before I start in on replacing the engine and tranny
from my 70' westy with the motor and trans. from my buddies 74'? I spent
some time in the library and archive but am still looking for comment on
specific compatibility issues.  Any input, warnings or blessings will be
appreciated.   -mj
