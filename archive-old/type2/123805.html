Subject: VENTS? Under the back of the front seats. 

76 bus. Not a westie. Ok, I have a few little slits, couple inches wide,
maybe half an inch high, a couple inches off the ground in the bulkhead
behind the front seats. I don't have the foggiest clue what they are.
They look factory though. They seem to be UNDER the seat supports. Are
those vents of some kind? Even have a CLUE as to what I'm talking about?

 
Cheers
Chris
