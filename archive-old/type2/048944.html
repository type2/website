Hey there David,

David Hunt posted the following a while back (10/98??):

&gt; Someone wrote and asked for the source of the plaid Westy cloth.  I
&gt; lost that 
&gt; email, so here it is for everyone.  FWIW, he has plaid for green
&gt; Westies plus 
&gt; the orange, gold and brown.  He is out of the orange with the
&gt; narrow green stripe.

&gt; Elyria, Ohio 44035
&gt; 440-322-9459  440-323-6414

I'm not sure if they still have any fabric left, but it's worth a
shot. Also check the online VW ads often for people parting out
campers. (see my webpage and click on the classifieds button)

Hope this helps,
