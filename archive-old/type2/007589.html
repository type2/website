&gt;&gt; I didn't know Audi made a waterboxer either.  Am I missing something?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     ???? Waterboxers is a generic term for water-cooled engines, or so 
I
&gt;thought.

A &quot;boxer&quot; engine is an engine in the horizontally opposed configuration.  
Like the Volkswagen air-cooled engine or the Porsche 911 engine or the 
various engines that Subaru builds.  A waterboxer, then, is a 
water-cooled boxer engine, a la the new Porsche 911 engine or the 
Porsche Boxster (name of the car is a hint at the engine!) or the 
Volkswagen Vanagon from '83.5-'91.  Standard inline or V-configuration 
water-cooled engines are not waterboxers (or wasserboxers in German -- I 
guess we then have luftboxers).
