&gt; &gt; The basic difference is that the finish on an impact socket won't chip
&gt; like chrome will on a regular socket. Not a factor for a ratchet but it
&gt; becomes one when you drive it with an air powered impact gun.
&gt;
&gt; I have a set of S-K 6-point sockets with a very finely-toothed ratchet.
&gt; Never broke a socket, and the fine tooth ratchet allows me to turn nuts in
&gt; very tight spaces without repositioning the socket.

I have never broken any S-K tool in 35 years!!!! they're just so bloody
expensive to start with...
