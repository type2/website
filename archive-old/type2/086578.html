Subject: loose + terminal on coil

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C1F454.B7E7DA60

I was wondering if anyone has ever dealt with a loose + terminal on the c=
oil.  Don't trust the connection, and wondering if I should fix, or just =
go new.  This one is original bosch.  Never had that much experience with=
 newer ones.  On another note, in the process of building the engine for =
my 69 bus, I encountered a (slight) problem.  Has this ever happened to y=
ou???     So there I was, minding my own business, installing a 34 pict c=
arb on my newly rebuilt motor, when all of a sudden.......    yup you gue=
ssed it, stud on the carb pulled out!  As I pulled the nut from the botto=
m, I could see old threads.  And so it is, my carb has no threads left in=
 it at all...  Rather than drilling, and tapping, I took a 13mm nut and c=
ut it in half with a dremmel, and a cutting wheel.  Now I have this teeny=
 tiny nut on the top of my carb to hold it in place.  I was thinking of m=
aking a couple, and keeping some on hand in the bus.  Is this ridiculous?=
  Should I just break down, and tap it?  I just don't know...    Bus Gyps=
y
