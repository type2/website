+AD4-better-stocked hardware stores.  Properly installed, they will support as

I asked this question maybe 2 years ago, and was warned of the downside.
Still I fitted the tyre up front, and a few weeks back it rolled into a
wall. The whole impact was taken by the tyre and front panel. It never got
as far as the bumper which was supposed to take the jolt. I've now got a
front end with a lot of filler in. I guess I need the tyre up front to hide
the mess.
