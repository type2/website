Subject: what about roof top AC?

I started wondering what that box was thats on top of all RVs. Once i
found out it was AC i thought, why can't i have one of those for my
77 Riviera camper. Turns out they run on A/C so you'll need a generator
too, but they do have optional heat too. They are pricy ~ $600 for unit
plus ~ $400 for a generator, but can you put a price on comfort. And they
even worked with the motor stopped. 

I was wondering if any has tried this. If my Riviera pop top could hold
75lbs, or if i could remove the front 'glass part and put it there, right
above the front seats. And make some kind of rear bumper mount for the
generator.

this is the two products i thought would work good, there are lots others:

this AC unit

and this generator

thanks for the input:
