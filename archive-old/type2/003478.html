X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I have a 1979 FI that I have been trying to get on the road for several
weeks now.  Thanks to the group I have been able to troubleshoot the
injection system and have found the following....

1.  Fuel Pump burned up.  Since been replaced.  New filter and hoses
installed.
2.  All 4 fuel injectors were clogged.  Since been cleaned and verified to
work correctly.  (Visually verified while engine was cranked)
3.  The double relay was defective.  Since been replaced.
4.  The airflow meter pump cutoff switch was defective (causing the fuel
pump to run all the time and possibly causing the damage to the relay and
pump).  This problem has been repaired.
5.  The cold start valve was checked and is in proper operating condition.
6.  The thermo-time switch was checked and is in proper operating condition.
7.  All grounds are good.

And this brings me to today....the vehicle will now start but dies 15-20
seconds after it starts.  In addition, when the fuel pump is run for more
than 5-10 seconds (as it does when the airflow meter activates it), the
sound of pump changes from a low hum to a gurgling noise suggesting that it
is not getting enough fuel or sucking air from somewhere.  The odd part is
that when I test the pump pressure and flow, everything meets specs per the
troubleshooting manuals I have.  I didn't hear the gurgling when I measured
the fuel flow rate by running the pump and pumping fuel out of the test port
by the 3/4 injectors...???

Has anybody experienced this?  Is the gurgling normal??  I am leaning
towards a clog in the fuel tank or lines feeding the fuel filter (all the
lines from the fuel filter on are in good shape and have been replaced), as
the reason the vehicle cuts out.  I am planning on draining the tank and
checking the screen tomorrow.

Any thoughts on this?

Thanks - Mike
