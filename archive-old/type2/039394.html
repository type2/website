A lean mixture can cause this. If it has leaned out due to failure of
something from sitting, it may or may not be adjustable. Draining the old
gas and changing the fuel filter is in order. You may well have
contaminated the injectors.

&gt;2. A timing light during idle shows that there is a &quot;wander&quot; in timing
&gt;from 4 degrees after TDC to about 8 before TDC- It may hold OK for 3
&gt;seconds, then wander down, then up!  It does advance properly with
&gt;rpms.  Seems strong in the idle, about 900 rpm.

ECU is trying to compensate for bad combustion due to ills and weaknesses
associated with contamination, poor fuel pressure, yada, yada. These
vehicles can develop lots of problems if not set up right for extended long
storage and non-use. 

Verify fuel quality and delivery and spray patterns once you know the
ignition is spec. Old gas is strange alchemy and if you run it through the
system, much mayhem can be wrought.
