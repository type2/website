Subject: [T2] Travel without Casper :-(

Anyone form the list stayed in any hostels in Switzerland ????
Comments ?????
Friday Bus content............
Our very good friends who travel the World in a '71 Westy live in Switzerland,
and we will soon ship Casper (2003) over there to travel these places, and 
more?

I guess maybe this is stretching the intention of the list a bit, but Bus 
Folks go to and stay at all the kewel places, so to question to the group 
seems to be a prime target for info.

Please reply off list............ !!

Mary Beth and I are thinking it might be too boring to spend all our time 
in a hotel in Switzerland, so we are thinking of hunkering down here, so as 
to gather our wits about us,

Then, maybe a few day trips out of Zurich, staying in hostels, such as:

Mary Beth wants to take the train to:

Once there, the world will be our oyster:
Mind 'ya now,
I ain't thinking about becoming an aged 54, polio inflicted backpacker.
The trains will get me where I wanna go just fine, thank you, until Casper 
does a better job in 2 years time.
