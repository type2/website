Subject: Hydraulic lifter help

I've been lurking way in the background for quite a while 'cause my busses
have been doing fine and I've been working on some 2 wheel transportation.

My 80 Vanagon decided to give me some trouble lately. Came up with a bad
lifter on #2 intake. Just finished pulling it out of my AVP rebuilt engine.
NOT happy with what I see! The lifter is worn out. The contact surface is
concave and the piston inside is worn out. I only have about 4000 miles on it
since I got it. I don't believe it could have been reground. The cam lobe
looks good though, suspect it was reground.

Anyway, the Febe lifter I got from Bus Depot is longer than the one I pulled
out. I had noticed that the adjuster on that valve was turned in more than the
others to get a good adjustment even when the lifter was pumped up. Thinking
that maybe this lifter is not the same as the rest. Do you all think I will
have problems putting this longer Febe lifter in place of the shorter one I
removed?
