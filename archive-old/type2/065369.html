Along this thread...

After driving approx 500 kilometres with no problem 
(shutting engine off and on numerous times) I park it in the 
driveway. I go to start it up again, absolutely nothing. I 
turn the key and there is not so much as a click.

I just left it for the night as I was in no mood to deal 
with it.The next morning I come out and turn the key over, 
starts right up!!!

Is it possible for the starter solenoid to overheat or 
something??
