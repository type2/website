Subject: RE: Type 2 Front Seat Replacement?

I'm not sure of what the compatibility issues are year to year. I'd ask the 
list for that info. I think the Baywindows were the same starting in '75 or 
'76 until the Vanagons in about '87.

As for the armrests - the outside armrest - closest to the door - it won't 
fit the baywindow's body I'm told. Maybe something with the seat belts as 
well. Ask the list for that info. My seats did not come with armrests so 
for me it's been a moot question.

Apparently the difference in the seats' quality lies with the fact that the 
earlier VW seats relied on springs and that layer of thatch (what else do 
you call it?) and a layer of board (cardboard?) right under the cover. The 
Vanagon sets at first glance uses mostly foam which adapts better to the 
shape of the driver's posterior better than that set of springs and the 
board. Maybe some home-grown seat specialist could tell us how to make the 
OEM seat in the baywindow more comfortable using 
easily/locally/commonly/economically found materials.

Were all the VW engineers masochists? Noisy, cold, slow vehicles with 
curious handling characteristics and bad seats... Either they were 
masochists or crummy engineers. Either way I love my old Westfalia and I'll 
be correcting it's shortcomings as I can afford to.

&gt;Thanks Chris. I'm pretty sure that the Vanagon seats won't slide right into
&gt;my '71 bus. I guess I'd have to get the mounting tracks and seat bases from
&gt;the Vanagon too. Any idea the earliest bus year where the seats are
&gt;completely compatible with the vanagon?
&gt;
&gt;I think you have the right idea replacing the seats instead of restoring the
&gt;originals. I've priced the covers and pads and it would cost around $150 +
&gt;shipping just to restore the original crappy seats. My don't even have
&gt;headrests.
&gt;
&gt;Do your vanagon seats have armrests?

&gt;
&gt;You end up sitting too high....
&gt;
&gt;Will enough surgery it looked like it might work but I gave up before it
&gt;was too late and just bought some Vanagon seats which slide right on to the
&gt;late baywindow seat tracks.
&gt;
&gt;Mine came out of an early Vanagon, were brown vinyl, and the driver's seat
&gt;had a split. I will recover both to match my interior. MUCH more
&gt;comfortable!!!!! Some of my old seat's problems were age and wear. Some of
&gt;the seats' problems were poor design. My friend has stock seats that have
&gt;new covers and stuffing and they still aren't as comfortable as these
&gt;Vanagon seats. The Vanagon seats have a bit of contour to the stuffing and
&gt;it fits the posterior better whereas the baywindow seats are simply flat
&gt;and in many cases contain stuffing no more.
&gt;
&gt;The later Vanagon seats are better yet I hear. There is a cut off though -
&gt;a point where the newer Vanagon seats don't fit the baywindow tracks. Maybe
&gt;the list can advise.
&gt;
&gt;My seats were cheap but they generally go for about $50 a pair I think and
&gt;it costs about $50 to send them from Mississippi to Tennessee for example.
&gt;
&gt;There is a U-Haul box that does the job perfectly. You sit one seat in the
&gt;bottom of the box and turn the other seat over so that the second seat's
&gt;headrest in on the seat base of the first seat.

&gt; &gt;Chris,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hey, I was looking thru the archives at Type2_dot_com for info about someone
&gt;who
&gt; &gt;had replaced the front seats in their bus with some seats from a car. I saw
&gt; &gt;your posting where you were thinking about using a pair of GTI seats you
&gt; &gt;had. I wondered if you had done it and how well it worked. I was thinking
&gt;of
&gt; &gt;doing the same but was also thinking that you might end up sitting too
&gt;high.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;
