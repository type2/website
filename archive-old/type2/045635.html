Subject: [T2] Failed Air Care HELP!

I rebuilt my engine in April, it's only got 6000 miles on it. It has never
run better. One thing I did was put a bit of a hot cam in it but I was told
it was fairly conservative and that I wouldn't have problems with emmisions
testing although you can hear the rump rump rump when idleing. The other
thing I've done is put on a empi muffler, it has the oval muffler unit
almost at a 45 deg angles (similar to ones I've seen on japanese cars) with
two pipes coming out into two chrome tips each. That's 4 tips folks. Looks
great,sounds great, gives me more power...starting to sound too good to be
true. I'm wondering if this could be the problem?

I passed the driving test but failed the idle test, here are the idle stats:
 Hydrocarbons (ppm) Max Allowed: 1052  My reading: 4652  Ouch!!!!
 Carbon Monoxide(%) Max Allowed: 5.54  My reading: 6.64

My insurance runs out on Wednesday so any suggestions would be appreciated.
