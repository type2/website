Subject: ariba puck campers on line
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey volks,
just a quick question.  someone emailed me after
looking at my website and was inquiring about the
ariba puck campers.  seems he has just picked one up
and wanted to know more about them and how they were
popular with the vw bus folk back in the day.  does
anyone know of any websites on line that mention these
or have any info on them.  im curious as well.  i know
i saw something once but cant remember where and an
initial search came up with nothing.  can anyone help
me out?
thanks
shelby
