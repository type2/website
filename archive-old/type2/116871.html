Subject: Are Vanagons safer than Bays??

I'm thinking about selling my 71 Westy and buying an aricooled Vanagon 
(80-83).  I am wondering if how much safer a Vanagon would be and if it is 
safe enough to have my 4 year old son to ride in it. I've seen pics of Bays 
when they are hit and it's not pretty, I'm scared that if he was in the back 
and I got broadsided that he would be crushed.

Is the Vanagon body style much a safer design? Also, for those with 
aircooled Vanagons, is there much of a differnce between the years?

Thanks in advance for your input,

Daniel
