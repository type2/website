Subject: re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters for '75 1.8...question

David,

&gt;&gt;The short answer is that you can just pop the new lifters in with the
&gt;&gt;regular cam, push rods, and rocker arm springs, and it'll work just
&gt;&gt;fine.  Many have had success with this.  But why spring for new
lifters
&gt;&gt;if you are not going to use a new cam?  Setting valves is not that big
a
&gt;&gt;deal.  Save that $$ for the real problems you *will* have, I'd say.

&gt;IMO hydraulic lifters are a great investment.  Hydraulics keep your
valve train in perfect adjustment.  You can't do as well by checking the
valve
&gt;lash every 3k miles, or 300 miles, or even every 3 miles.

Right, and if &quot;perfect&quot; is what you're after, then solid lifters are not
the answer, but then, neither is popping hydraulic lifters in a worn
engine, no?

&gt;The hydraulics do the same thing continually.  What's more, on a type
IV, popping the valve covers is a PITA.

Slip a rag or a plastic grocery bag or something under the bail and pull
out and down.  This is not hard, and certainly not an argument against
solid lifters!

&gt;Changing to hydraulics is one of the best modifications I even made to
my bus, and I guess every single auto manufacturer agrees with me, since
all new &gt;cars these days have hydraulic lifters.

But we are not talking about a new car, or even an old car with a new
engine.

&gt; ... Arguing against such substantial improvements on the basis of cost
or engine longevity just doesn't make sense.

Not if you have no cost constraints.  As I phrased my response, I was
pointing to an issue of *priority*, not arguing against hydraulic
valves.  I wouldn't put new hydraulic valves into an old engine with its
worn cam because, like most people I know who drive a bus, I have a
limited supply of money and an unlimited supply of problems with the
bus.  For getting ready to take a trip across the country, there are
lots of things that should be taken care of before messing with the
lifters, which might actually introduce a new problem (i.e. bad lifter)
into the equation at the last minute, when it could be a huge
inconvenience.

The cam and lifters are supposed to be replaced as a set.  The wear in
together.  When you rebuild a solid lifter engine, if you have the extra
time and money to acquire the extra bits you need to do the conversion,
I certainly wouldn't argue against it.  I have hydraulic lifters in both
of my busses.  However, it is perhaps worth mentioning that, while I
have had a bad hydraulic lifter problem, I have never had a solid lifter
problem.
