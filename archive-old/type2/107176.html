Subject: Re: [T2] re help adjusting the hydraulic valves-BostonBob'stome

The whole point of having hydraulic lifters is to provide complete
closing of the valve at any condition of the engine that can affect
clearances between the cam lobe and the valve stem end.  It does this
while allowing zero valve lash, meaning a quieter engine and less wear
on the ends of the moving parts between cam and end of the valve.  
There appears to be a conception about oil filled lifters that G. Lyle
could better explain as a physicist- that they are &quot;solid&quot;, which cannot
be true if they are to provide zero lash at any engine temperature or
condition.  I presume that the lifter pumped up balances against the
initial preload setting, so zero lash is kept. The way it is lubricated
allows for the oil to enter the lifter through the side hole under the
lifter piston.  Common sense says that if the rocker adjustor is screwed
in so the piston bottoms out, then the lifter effectively is solid and
valve will likely not completely close.  A lifter adjusted so the piston
is within its minima/maxima should allow the zero valve lash when oil
filled.  If it is adjusted so the piston is very close to the snap ring,
there are times it likely will hit the snap ring, especially if some oil
has drained out.  Also, the valve will not completely open, affecting
power.  As I read Boston Bob's post, new/rebuilt engines have some
settling in of the valves which naturally affects the preloaded position
of the lifter piston.  Hence there is some logic to starting with a
minumum preload, but I question allowing an intentional gap- if there is
trapped air this will allow even less opening of the valve.  His concern
is the ability to get all air out of the lifter (preloading the lifter),
and that it could expand in a hot engine and not let the valve close. 
Come on, George, jump in on this- I believe trapped air is like trapped
air in a hydraulic brake line, it compresses readily and gives a spongy
lifter that clatters due to the piston hitting its bottom and the valve
actually stays cooler as it is closed longer and opens less high?  The
lifter is located on its side, and it should rotate due to the eccentric
pushing by the cam lobe-thus letting trapped air eventually get drived
out as the side hole comes in an upward position.  Worn lifters I
believe let the oil out quicker, air in more readily, and thus clatter
more on warmup.  One item not discussed here is the oil pressure when
the engine is really hot- is there a minimum pressure to keep the oil in
the lifter?  I have not noticed my well worn engine clattering more at
its hot idle pressure of 5 psi (240,000 mi on all of valve train but the
lifters; about 140K on them)- a mechanic claimed I needed them when I
noticed valve clatter after 100K; now I just wait or drive easily until
they are pumped up.  I can send a pic of my adjustor tip- still round
after 240K mi!
