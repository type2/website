Subject: Bus Depot

Hey guys,

     Just wanted to praise the Bus Depot.... I've been looking everywhere for
several parts and I found them at www.busdepot_dot_com. I made my order last week,
and it was promptly shipped! Thanks!!!

My only complaint is that... the box clearly stated: &quot;KEEP REFRIGERATED&quot; in
big bold letters down the side of the box. It obviously wasn't as it was
sitting on my front step when I got home. I'm a little bit worried about how
that will affect my ignition lock, and the tail-lights lenses. I guess I won't
know until after I install them.

Ok, that was probably really lame, but I've had a couple of gin and tonics,
and as far as I'm concerned, that's the funniest thing I've heard all day.


Thanks Bus Depot!


Todd
