Subject: Oil gallery/galley plug fix, longish

	Some weeks ago I wrote about fixing a popped oil gallery plug, and heard
the idea solution was probably to tap the sucker, putting grease on the tap
to catch the shavings. I got around to tapping it today, and, while being
quite careful with grease and whatnot [I also plugged the back with a
sponge], I seem to have gotten shavings in there. Maybe. Here's the scoop,
and a picture too:

The gallery I'm worried about is in the rear of my type4 engine (1800 case),
adjacent to the screw-on oil filter. Looks like this:


	 __________
	|Oil filter|------------[plug #1]
	|__________|
			|	\
			|	 [plug #2]
			|		\
						Oil pump over here


	So. The plug in caps is the one that popped; I tapped them both. However,
after tapping plug #2, I noticed some shavings in the &quot;uphill&quot; oil passage,
denoted by the upper \ mark. Seems obvious to me that this passage heads to
the screw-in oil filter, although I don't know for sure. I fished them out
with a grease-laden Q-tip. Paranoid, I dug around the &quot;downhill&quot; passage,
looking for shavings. I found none, but it seems counterintuitive to me to
have shavings in one passage and not in the other. It's quite possible that
they tumbled downhill, out of sight, and are irretrievable.

So now, the question.

Which way does the oil flow, up or down? Does the &quot;downhill&quot; passage even
lead to the oil pump, like I think it does? I don't have an empty case
sitting around to play with, otherwise I'd check it myself. My bias right
now is that if the oil flow is uphill, those shavings will have a nice wide
passage straight to the screw-in oil filter, which just means I change the
filter and the oil next week and not sweat. But if it flows downhill into
the pump, they will almost certainly score my pump, plug my journals, and I
will weep. I'm about to pull the oil pump, clean it out real good and check
for passages anyway, because that seems to be the safest bet.

Anybody have any ideas? Which way does the oil go? The Hoover repair in the
archives suggests adding pressurized oil to the oil pressure sensor such
that it squirts out the oil gallery while you're tapping, thereby &quot;carrying
with it (hopefully!) all of the swarf produced by the tapping operation.&quot; I
just can't see this: with an uphill and downhill passage through the hole,
how could this work? Wouldn't the pressurized flow just take the swarf
either uphill or downhill, but keep it in the system?

Scratching my head but TIA,

Ian
