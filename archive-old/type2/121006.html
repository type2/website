Subject: Re: [T2] Air Fuel Mixture Logic

Whoa, this does not jive with Karl's claim the 77 cam ( or the 75 we
switched to hydraulics) has the same specs as the 78-we successfully
switched to hydraulics on the 75 and it runs/times fine....there were
issues regarding cold idle (terrible until hot) but they were traced to
vac leaks in the brake line!  Now I am tired of hearing one poster
saying you CAN'T use a stock cam with hydraulics and another saying you
CAN..and the claim the case supplies oil differently to hydraulic
lifters-what is the real bottom line story here?  Karl?

Re: will only idle with the timing over-advanced: I
had exactly the same condition once when I tried to
use hydraulic lifters on a solid lifter cam. I guess
the lash ramps on the cam were slightly opening the
valves too soon. I modified a 009 dist. to run lots of
initial advance and proper total advance and got it
running pretty good until I finally switched back to
solids and cured all my problems. This was on a 914
but thats just about the same as your engine.
