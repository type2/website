Subject: Re: [T2] parts needed for 70 bus

&gt; Has anyone got some good extra tin for my doghouse cooler engine?
&gt; Specifically, the Hoover Bit tin that bolts to the oil cooler(see link), and
&gt; the correct and complete lower tin parts, everything below the top cylinder
&gt; covers? I am using type 3 style cool tins. I need everything else.

tom
