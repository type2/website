Subject: RE: [T2] what years are diesel engines available

And having driven several diesel Vanagons, Fiat Ducatos, diesel Peugeot 
sedans, Mercedes diesel vans, etc....

...remember that the diesel makes a bit more noise and prefers to be spun 
at lower rpms than a gasoline equivalent. Means it'll like have a really 
high top gear (slower rpms) and a 5 speed is going to be really nice for 
this job. A standard baywindow tranny is geared much too low for highway 
use with a diesel. You could have a custom ring and pinion made of course...

Furthermore you better start investing in soundproofing or earplugs... Our 
buses are noisy to begin with and a diesel is going to up the auditory 
excitement. &lt;grin&gt;

All that said I LOVE diesels. I'd love to have a turbo/intercooled diesel 
flat six (if anything like that existed).

Tatra is probably a good source for aircooled diesel info as that is a 
specialty for them. They build HEAVY 6 wheel drive construction and highway 
trucks (think Semi-trucks) with all-wheel independent suspension as well as 
cars. Saw one at a tiny Tennessee car show (Red Boiling Springs, TN) 
hauling a Messerschmidt mini-car and a Tatra T87 
(http://www.tatra_dot_demon.nl/cars-T87.htm). Notice that the T87 had an 
aircooled V-8 in the rear... They were so fast that at one point the Nazi 
command prohibited their Officers from buying or acquiring these during 
WWII b/c too many officers were driving too fast (false security due to 
good design?) and getting themselves killed. The Tatras I saw were riding a 
flatbed Tatra aircooled diesel Tatra 815 
(http://www.clearlight_dot_com/~brawicz/tatra_trucks/tatra815-16.jpg).

How about 500HP?

Oh it's easy to dream when the price tag isn't important...

http://www.tatra_dot_demon.nl/ is an interesting read.
