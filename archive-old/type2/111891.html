 &gt;&gt;Would it be possible to install

&gt; 79 into the 72. &lt;&lt;

Kyle,
I did just this a few months ago, Only I didn't
transplant the tranny. I put a 79 F.I. engine into a
72 carb bus.  If you use the 72 tranny, you'll have to
use the flywheel off of the 72 engine. But if you are
using the 79 tranny, it will be fine.  Don't forget
that you will also have to use the fuel tank from the
79 as well, because the 72 fuel tank only has the one
port whereas the 79 tank has a second port for the
fuel injection return line. Misc bits you'll have to
use from the 79 are: electric fuel pump, double relay
located on the firewall, and the fuel pressure
regulator found just in front of the firewall tin.
