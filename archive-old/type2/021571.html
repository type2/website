Subject: Exhaust manafold tin

I have exhaust manifolds off of a 75 1800 and a 78 2000. The pipes from
the 75 have some tin around them that is apparently a heat shield, but
there are rust holes through the tin. The pipes off the 78 do not have
the tin. Don't know if they rusted off, were removed by the P.O., or
were never there. The manifold pipes themselves are both in good shape.

I'm rebuilding the 2L engine and was wondering if the sheet metal over
the exhaust manifold is necessary or not? I am guessing the sheet metal
has something to do with keeping the exhaust gasses hot as long as
possible so maybe some more of the HCs would burn off before it exits
the tailpipe? Will I hurt anything if I install the manifolds that don't
have the tin or am I worried about nothing?

Thanks,
Tom

p.s. This is the section that bolts directly to the heads, not the
heater boxes.
