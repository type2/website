Subject: Frozzen adjusters:

     Check this out: Twenty odd years ago, after fighting frozen adjusters,
I  tried this. Drill a 1/8 inch hole in the housing (size of a WD 40 spray
straw). To figure the drill point , use the length of an adjuster plus 1/8
inch this will allows you to drill into the cavity in the housing at the end
of the adjuster. Fill the cavity with WD 40, or its equal, let it soak until
the adjuster can be removed, either by twisting or driving out with a
punch/drift. I use a flat chisel that I have ground square on the end, I use
it to  tap on the under side of the adjuster star teeth, sometimes this will
pop the adjuster out without drilling.
    After removal, clean the housing with a &quot;bulb holder&quot; wire brush, sand
paper, etc. Next free up the adjustment screw, then apply a good coat of
anti-seize on every thing and reinstall.
    I haven't failed to free one up yet since I started doing it this way
(I'm sure I will have one tomorrow).
