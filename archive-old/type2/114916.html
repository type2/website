Subject: Heater

Hey guys;
Can you help me identify a heater?  Is this stock? or did someone add this
later?  I have no literature on this.
My van is a '78 west conversion.  see:

http://www.eggersteel_dot_com/pages/btuley/vw/van_heat.htm

It is connected to the LP tank.  I've never used used it. I just wonder if
anyone has seen such a beastie and has any stores about one.

Second;
My cables that connect to the heater boxes &amp; heat/defrost-vent are
disconnected.   I needed and got some replacement cables to the heater
boxes, but I can't figure out how they connect.  The previous owner wired
them together.  Could one of you guys take a pic of the cables all connected
behind the instrument cluster &amp; either post it or send it to me?  thanks.

Third;
You know that rubberized plastic edging - &quot;T&quot; shaped that runs around all
the edges of the camper wooden interior.  the part of the &quot;T&quot; inserts into
the slotted wood to hold it in.   Mine has hardened and shrank over the
years.  Looks funky, is wavy &amp; the closet is hard to close.  Anybody know
where to find replacement edge covers?

I thank you &amp; Maynard thanks you.
-Brian
