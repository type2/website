Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door won't pop open

&gt; recently the sliding door ceased to &quot;pop&quot; open - i now have to put my 
&gt; fingers in the seam, push the handle down again and pull it all the way 
&gt; open. it wasn't a sudden change, but slowly got worse.

The hinges are a little complicated, check a few things on them when you 
have them off and out. Obviously look at the guide piece (plastic) should 
still have the channel as you stated is good, then the metal roller should 
roll and not be bent or wobbly, Then on the busy end look for the two hooks 
to still have spring tension and not be broken these hold the hinge open 
when sliding. They must have the hook to engage the notch on the front shaft 
pivot. Make sure this is not brocken as well. Of course the big spring 
inside the mount is what makes this thing pop open so check and lube it as 
well. Thats enough to get you started. We do sell rebuilt hinges for $125 if 
anyone needs one.

&gt; i checked the archives, and all i could find were &quot;lube it&quot;  and the same 
&gt; instructions for refurbishing found in the library.

Lube everything, not just the hinge. Lube the rear lock mech, the front mech 
and the handle.

&gt; also, i remember reading that the cable/rod assy could be adjusted, but i 
&gt; don't see how that affestc the rear mount.

This really sound like your issue, pull the panel and adjust the cable I bet 
it is just stretching, but due to gummy lock mech.

&gt; last, could door geometry be a factor? the upper left corner doesn't sit 
&gt; as tightly as i'd like......

This is all done with the front lower and upper rollers. Check your lower 
roller tray for wear.
