Subject: Please help with a wiring nightmare

Hello all - 
 
I have a 81 CA emissions Vanagon.  I'm having a devil of a time with getting current to the fuel pump.
 
When I first put everything together, two weeks ago, I connected the double relay backwards.  I noticed after a while the fuel pump was running all the time, even without a key in the ignition.  (I think this fried the fuel pump)
 
When I changed the double relay to the correct way, the fuel pump never gets any current (and I check the terminals).  Not with the key in the ignition, not with the AFM pushed open, and not while cranking the engine.
 
My first thought was the double relay must have fried when I connected it backwards.  I ordered a new one from the Bus Depot, and it did not solve the problem.
 
Anyone got any ideas?  I'm desperate....I think it might be a wiring problem somewhere, but I've checked about everything I can think of with Bentley...
 
The Vanagon was running when I pulled the engine a year ago and began this nightmare that seems without end...
 
Thanks - 
 
E. Marc Coe
