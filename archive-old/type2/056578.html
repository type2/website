&gt; so i decide to go ahead and buy 5 new tires. $436 and
&gt; change, after i get suckered into the lifetime replacement scam.

Yeah, the &quot;lifetime replacement&quot; deal is pretty much like a service
contract.  The fee they charge has to cover the tires they replace,
the administrative cost, and turn a bit of a profit.  The only people
I know of who really come out ahead on these deals are ranchers and
miners who do 75% of their driving on gravel (or worse) roads.  These
guys always carry 2 spares, as getting two flats in a day isn't all
that unusual for them.  They shred tires regularly, so you can figure
out where your money is going!

&gt; and the guy is telling me about this new process they have called
&quot;SIPING&quot;...
&gt; and what they do is run your tire through the machine, and it cuts
some very
&gt; fine diagonal lines through the tread,...but they make some pretty
&gt; impressive claims...better traction...and tires last 20% longer
...and &quot;a smoother, quieter ride&quot;.

My Dad got talked into this by a tire dealer in Oregon.  The tires
worked OK, but they wore out in kind of chunky manner.  No perceptable
difference in ride or traction, and the tires probably wore out a bit
faster.  If this process was really all so good, the manufacturers
would do it at the factory.  

Also, the rubber is pretty highly stressed in your bus tires (quite a
bit of weight on not too big of a footprint), so I would be leery of
upsetting the stability of the tread rubber.

&gt; and just so it will show up and confuse somebody else when they
search the
&gt; archives, i'm going to put in my understanding of the number of
plies and load
&gt; rating thing.
&gt; 
&gt; first of all, the y356 185r14 is a light truck/commercial tire
available in
&gt; either a C or D load rating. C probably OK for lighter busses, D
probably
&gt; better for campers and cargo busses,


The gross weight of the camper and station wagon is the same, so the
tire requirement (at least from the factory) is the same.  You can get
by with lesser tires in a station wagon as the empty weight is a lot
less than a camper and you usually don't get fully loaded.  I don't
recommend this (see my trip report coming this friday if you want to
know why!).

VW requires a load rating of 1400 pounds.  I'm pretty sure that the
185R14 &quot;C&quot; tire will handle this.  A &quot;D&quot; rated tire is up around 1700+
pounds so it will handle a bus easily.

&gt; the y356 is a 6-ply tire. but that's not bad! if these were
cross-ply tires,
&gt; i.e., not steel-belted, then you would want 8 plies. but with the
y356, you
&gt; still get the additional plies in the sidewalls, but you don't need
as many
&gt; down under because they're steel. or at least that is how i
understand it.

With most of these tires you will get 2 polyester plies in both the
sidewall and tread (they wrap all the way around) and two steel plies
in the tread area only.  Standard load tires will have only one
sidewall ply.  The &quot;ply rating&quot; is a marketing gimmick that does not
state the actual number of plies.  For example, my Bridgestones are
&quot;8-ply rated&quot;, but only have four plies in the tread and two in the
sidewall.  I suppose that this is probably as strong or stronger than
the original rayon-carcass bias-ply tires that the bus came with.  

The real story is in the fine print on the sidewall that tells you the
actual load rating in pounds.  If the number is 1400 pounds or
greater, you're cool.

&gt; i'm beginning to wonder...when i look at everything that
&gt; needs to be done, all i see is dollar signs. is bringing it back to
factory
&gt; spec too expensive a proposition? even if that means a body-off
restoration?

Forget body-off,  It's welded to the frame!  If the bus moves you,
then it is definitely worth restoring.  &quot;If it's the toy of the
moment&quot; then perhaps it would be better off with someone else.

In terms of bang-for-the-buck, money put into a VW will get you a heck
of a lot more transportation than just about any other vehicle. 

&gt; i don't think the bus has any major problems, but it seems to have a
huge
&gt; number of minor ones. to the point where i'm not even sure where to
begin.

Start with safety,  Brakes, steering, lights, controls, are
priorities.  Then go to those things that can cause rust.  Even if you
can't fix a ding immediately, make sure that it doesn't provide a
place for rust to take hold.  When these are satisfied, then you are
ready for comfort and cosmetics.

&gt; i'd
&gt; rather not end up like some of the guys i've read about who end up
spending
&gt; $10K on their busses.  i'm feeling pretty ignorant right now, and
wondering if
&gt; i might not be in over my head. should i have just bought one in
better shape?

Keep your eyes open.  Nothing says that you can't work on the bus you
have and switch to another later on.  We're all ignorant in many
areas, but with the list behind you most problems are easily solved.
