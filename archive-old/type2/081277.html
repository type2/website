Subject: Engine Compartment Seal

Hello List,
Just bought a new engine compartment seal for my 1979 Riviera Camper =
with a 2.0 liter Type 4 engine. My question is - does the &quot;rubberized&quot; =
side of the seal go on the inside of the engine compartment or does it =
face down towards the ground?

Thank you all ~ Andy
