Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetics, and air cooled engines

Excuse me,

I thought this thread was about oils and air cooled engines, not buying new 
cars or where they are available. The fact is that VW is still building 
air-cooled cars and oil technology is constantly changing. Air-cooled 
technology is not standing stil, either. Check out what Tatra is building 
at:

http://www.tatra.cz/enff/konception/motor/

Where the cars are built or sold should not be a factor. I don't believe VW 
ever produced air-cooled cars in this country. However, there is a well 
known motorcycle company in the US that is about to celebrate 100 years of 
building air-cooled products.

I don't wish to continue in this thread as everyone has their own opinion on 
oil and I'm not about to try to convince anyone to switch oils.

I'll take the &quot;wild man&quot; bit as a compliment.

Thank you,

&gt;Good one Seth---
&gt;
&gt;And I just got back from my local  VW dealer, two blocks away---
&gt;They just don't seem to be carrying this model / style there.
&gt;Please direct me to my local North American distributor/ dealer for
&gt;these Bugs---
&gt;
&gt;And close by too---I might need to have some warranty work done.
&gt;
&gt;Oh--you say that there isn't any local dealer's in the US----
&gt;Awww--to bad--I had my heart set on another new antique---:&gt;)
&gt;  But I see that you conveniently live in Laredo--you could walk across
&gt;the river and buy one---I can't.
&gt;
&gt;I had a feeling that some wild man would come up with this one----
&gt;I should have added a US stipulation on the message.
&gt;
&gt;Later,
&gt;
&gt;Terry
