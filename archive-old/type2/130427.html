On the DVDA distributor, are you connecting the retard side (and timing 
to 5 ATDC)?

I noticed that even my old, worn-out DVDA was much more responsive if I 
disconnected the retard and re-timed to 7.5 BTDC (i.e. made it roughly 
equivalent to a SVDA)... that split second you gain in not having to 
&quot;un-retard&quot; the timing seems to make a lot of difference in throttle 
responsiveness, especially if coming off idle, coasting, or engine 
braking (where the vacuum in the plenum is highest, thus giving the 
most retard in the timing).

That timing retard was only there for idle emissions reduction anyway, 
and it was eliminated in late '76.

I'm really happy that your FI setup is working well now!  It's nice to 
see someone do this conversion in the right direction (rather then 
scrapping the superior FI system in favor of carburetors).
