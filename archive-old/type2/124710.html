Subject: Re: [T2] rear negative camber

Ok it looks like the general concensus is that I probably need new torsion
arm bushings to fix my camber problem. I jacked the rear end up and there is
no play that I can find, but I guess that's what it must be.

Until my money tree comes into fruition I guess I will continue to chew up
my passenger car tires. I plan to go ahead and do as much as I can during
the process (brakes, bearings, bushings, cv boots, etc.). I have read all
the warnings and it will be hard to resist the temptation to crank the
springs up a notch when I don't need to!! But I won't do it if it doesn't
need it, no use in tearing up my joints and all.

Thanks for all the help,

Rob Henley
