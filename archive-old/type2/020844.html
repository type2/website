Subject: Adding Westy pop top to standard bus.

Just acquired a Westfalia pop top from a 77that was converted to a high
top. The canvas is shot. Where's the best place to order one from?

Looking for anyone who has added the pop top to a bay window bus. I sat
the top on my bus and it looks wonderful, but my head filled with
questions when I started to think about cutting the roof. SCARY! Is
there anyplace I can get a pattern or something so I can be sure to get
it right the first time. I am also curious as to how far above the rain
gutter in the back should the top sit? During the trial fit I had it
about 1/2 inch above the gutter. Looks ok but this leaves the front of
the top about an inch above the little ridge above the windshield. I
don't know anyone around here with a real westy to look at and compare.

Are there supposed to be some kind of welded in bracket for the rear
hinges to bolt on to? The roof seems quite sturdy in this area but I
want to do this right.

As always, I really appreciate all of you helping me out.
