Subject: 2nd battery

I've hooked up a second battery in my '66 and it seems to work very well.

Originally I bought a battery isolator from JCW; it was a diode based unit but 
it didn't work very well because the diodes ate about .7 volts a piece (there were two)
to overall charging was reduced and the batteries never really reached full charge.

I happened to be having an oil change done at Canadian Tire (on my Civic) 'cause
my company gets a discount on that there and while that was happening, walked thru
the store and stumbled upon an RV isle.  There on the wall, surrounded by an aura of
light, was WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.  A battery SEPARATOR for an RV. The unit was 30$CDN
and is effectively a large solenoid.   It has three prongs, one which gets hot when the
ignition is on (I grabbed it from the coil) and the other two go to the +'s on the 
batteries.

Now, when the car is running, the batteries are in parallel, both being charged.
When the ignition is turned off, the batteries are seperated, and my accessories 
draw only from the deep cycle.

Works for me.
