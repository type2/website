Subject: Re:  adding front bench seat to bay Westy

Re putting a non-walkthrough seat in a bay bus-
  I did ths way back in 1973 in our 71 Westy, but remember the early
busses didn't have sliders for the passenger seat- I think I used a
&quot;double&quot; seat from a split window bus, and managed to hinge it so it
slipped into one rear &quot;catch&quot; when flipped down.  The other side
required a notch to be sawn into the seat pedestal so it could flip down
all the way.  In the front I put hinges that kept the seat in place &amp;
allowed the seat to be flipped up.  The seat cantilevered over the
walkthrough area.  Made for great &quot;intimacy&quot; with the future &quot;SO&quot; and
allowed snoozing, but we eventually preferred the walkthrough to
climbing over the seat!
   BTW, the space between the seats (where the stool sat) held a
portapotti with the stool top as a seat matching the rearfacing seat; a
padded seatback was made from the spare tire vinyl; it hinged from the
side of the fridge/sink unit and allowed walking through when the front
bench seat was removed!
