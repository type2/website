&gt;  Only problems I ever had were due to some hose sucking air
&gt; after the AFM (when it's intermittant, can be frustrating- and that one
&gt; turned out to be that little black y connector buried near that black
&gt; breather box.  It doesn't have a lot of bite and any end crack can make
&gt; it leak.  Which makes me wonder- could one use the smoke stick radon
&gt; mitigators use to look for air flow in cracks in your cellar slab?  You
&gt; could see where smoke was being sucked in.

Maybe, if it's not too breezy in there. A bee smoker would probably work too.
(I'll bet this list has the highest percentage of people who know what a bee smoker
is of all motorhead lists on the net!)
I was told that most any flammable liquid in a spray can with a straw will work
pretty good because it will be drawn into the engine and burn. I'd be a little
nervous about starting fluid because it's so explosive, but it has the advantage
over others that it does not leave a residue. The smoker would have this same
advantage (no residue) but not be flamable.
Something else that works pretty good for me  is a 2 foot length of fuel hose held
to my ear. It can really pinpoint where the leak is by sound.
Good maintenance might just be to figure on replacing everything rubber associated
with the injection a little bit BEFORE it cracked and caused such grief. Such items
would include the big S-shaped hose, all the little hoses hooking up the auxilliary
air regulator, perhaps the 4 big ones hooking the runners to the plenum (though
they look like they might last forever!) , the stuff hooking the decel valve up,
and the Y-shaped piece where the brake booster hooks to the manifold (this one
definitely fails!)
Maybe this should be your mission for March: inspect all these bits and the fuel
hoses too, of course, (if you haven't done it in the last year), and report back to
me that your mission was completed! (Just joking about reporting back to me, but
the whole list is always interested in horror stories- good news, keep it to
yourself.)
