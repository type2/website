&gt; It is working. The value can stick. If it looks like it has varnish
&gt; deposits, hand clean and flush with solvent without soaking the
&gt; electrical connector. Throttle body/carb cleaner works good. Eye
&gt; protection please, this stuff is bad news in the eyes from splash.

Thanks....put it in the freezer for about 20-25 minutes.  Valve opened
a bit more, maybe double what it was, but not entirely open....I could 
still push it back further, probably 2-3 times as far, with screwdriver 
through the hose port.  

After sitting and warming up to
room temp it was back to where it was originally.....probably about
1/8 - 1/10th the circumference of the hose outlets.  Using a simple
piece of hose to connect the ports directly giving full flow, as I
said, it starts and idles okay.

I don't have a portable 12v source yet to test to see if the valve
would close but I think the freezer test indicates it isn't opening
far enough if

&gt;&gt; After all this I returned to suspecting my aux. air valve which
&gt;&gt; tests out at 30 ohms electrically as it should.

&gt;&gt; The Bently manual says the valve is supposed to be all the way open
&gt;&gt; on cold start and close slowly.

&gt; Wil,

&gt; I think you mentioned at the beginning of this saga what year your
&gt; Vanagon is, but I don't remember. 

mentioned its an '80 in the subject line.

&gt; If it is gas engine, pre 86 (air
&gt; or water), the easiest way to check if the auxiliary air regulator
&gt; is passing enough air is to remove it altogether &amp; replace it and
&gt; the two connecting hoses with a single piece of hose of the
&gt; appropriate length. If the engine idles OK when cold with this hose
&gt; in place, the problem was the air regulator was not opening far
&gt; enough.

Thanks for mentioning this...reinforces that my method was sound.  I
thought I mentioned that this is what I did and the engine started and
idled okay this way.  I didn't leave it run long, minute or so, but it didn't quit on
its on.

On my first inspection seeing the valve WAS open I assumed that was
enough but I think it just isn't letting enough air through on cold
start.
