Subject: Dome Light Door Switch

Howdy,

I'm trying to make my dome light work from the door
switch again (the PO jury rigged it).

Hot wire is connected to the light, and negative goes
from the light to the door switches...makes sense so
far, and checks out with the meter.

Well it gets weird after the door switch.  I would
THINK that the switch should just go to ground from
there...but the wire from the switch (solid grey) goes
to fuse box and connects to the back side of a relay
socket (the socket is empty).

Anybody know if this is correct, and if so what's
supposed to be in the relay socket?

I'd like to do it right, but the obviois solution is
to just cut the grey wire and screw into the frame for
a ground.

TIA...
