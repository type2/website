Subject: Re: [T2] JC whitney heat shield insulation

Really?  That's kinda cool than (even thought I hate the store, of
course).

So far, they have Q-pads, kool patch, NASA insulation, and practically
everything else that is needed to redo the interior of my bus.  Beats
the hell outta mail ordering everything and then finding out you got the
wrong thing!
