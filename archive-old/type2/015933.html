Charlie, I am offended by the insinuation that I do not care.  You are in
no position to make such a judgement.

My objections to the proposed &quot;BPRS rescue squad&quot; are threefold:

First, the proposals do not address a need which is not already met by the
list.  The argument that the proposed &quot;BPRS rescue squad&quot; would improve
response time does have merit, however; the list had already proven time
and again it has the ability to respond when needed.  Let me assure
everyone I have experienced being broken down for three days on a Mexican
backroad.  At the time I might have liked to have been rescued within three
hours, but now I accept the fact this is the kind of thing you have to be
willing to cope with when you travel.

Second, to borrow the phrase from the movie: &quot;if you build it, they will
come.&quot;  If the &quot;BPRS rescue squad&quot; is put in place then inevitably the
freeloaders will come to take advantage of it.  It is the certain knowledge
of the inevitability of this abuse which fuels my strongest opposition.
The list in its present form is self-policing in that and all requests for
help are handled out in the open for everyone to see, and there is thus a
greatly reduced opportunity for fraud.

Third, whatever form the proposed &quot;BPRS rescue squad&quot; takes it will involve
some additional upkeep and maintenance by someone.  I believe my experience
with customer mailing lists can be applied here when I say that without
constant updating, any list of names is going to quickly be rendered
useless because of the percentage of people who move and change addresses.
