Subject: RE: [T2] Must-Have Item - Cup Holder/Storage Unit for Bus

&gt;  think that's awesome!
&gt; Too bad I smoke and actually *use* my ashtray. :-(


Hmmm...I wonder if you could pick up a small round plastic ash tray
somewhere that would sit inside one of the cup holders. Then you'd still
have one cup holder and the storage pouch left over after using the other
cup holder for the ash tray.
