Subject: Headlight Adjustment - I almost hit a deer!

Hi All,

2 weeks ago, I took Zoey out for a spin in the late evening and just missed
hitting a deer by the grace of God. Scared the hell out of me since my son
and a friend of mine were in the van with me.

Right after it happened, I couldn't help but wonder if my headlights are
properly adjusted? My brights seem to be no threat to passing drivers, and
my low beams are nothing to brag about. Bentley gives a method of
adjustment, but I feel that I neet to have a protractor to do it! I remember
the discussion about Hellas a while ago, but I am not quite ready to give up
on the stock setup.

Anyone got any advice on adjustment or a suggestion on a good stock bulb?

Hopefully I can get this one done before I have another deer sitting in my
lap!

Mahalo,

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
