Consider that just because you cleaned the carb, it doesn't necessarily
mean you don't still have a restriction somewhere. You must get an exhaust
gas reading to verify actual mixture. For sure, make sure you are using
Bently procedure for mixture adjustment and you are getting good responce
from turning the screw in and out. If you aren't, you still have a carb
problem. That all assumes good compression and proper ignition which should
always be verified before any fuel troubleshooting.

Are you using VW exhaust parts, or an aftermarket something?? If
mechanicals and ignition and carb check out, you have an exhaust leak. When
you cleaned out that carb what did the float level look like. If it's too
low, it could account for some leaness. Verify that if you aren't sure.
