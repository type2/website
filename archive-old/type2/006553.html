Hello List,

    This post below brings to mind one of the things we all claim to like
most about our 1930's design cars. There simplicity! Why mess with a good
thing, I'll bet some of you guys would suggest Dolly Parton get implants.
    I'm not trying to start a big war about the pros and cons of points
verse electronics. I just want to point out (no pun meant) that points seem
to always give you plenty of warning before they go south. Performance will
drop off, hard starting, rough running, loss of mileage, etc. for several
hundred, if not thousands of miles. Where as electronic ign will just die on
the road, or not start when you come out of the 7 - 11 at 2:00 am with milk
for the baby.
    I mean what do you save for your $90.00, $3.50 for a set of points, ten
minuets to change them, every year? (over simplified, but you get the idea.
Tune up once a year and go).
    Now the high performance guys out there may need the hotter spark with
longer duration, but the box stocker.............. leave it original!
    Isn't one of the &quot;perks&quot; of these cars the &quot;fun&quot; of working on them?
Like the ad in VW Trends, something like, &quot;I just love to adjust and clean
my points&quot;. Well its not that I do, but I am going to change the plugs, and
adjust the valves, etc. so another ten minuets, why not, after all its just
fun right?
    Ok, save the $90.00 bucks toward the price of points over next ten years
worth of tune ups, plus the savings on tow ins. Take your best girl/guy out
to eat, and be confident the car will start when you leave.
    See ya!

&gt; First I want to say a big THANK YOU to Charlie and Al, and ncbus for all
the suggestions last night.  Although it turned out to be none of them..
lol. it was however, the Pertronix electronic ignition that we bought and
installed in mid february.  It only lasted a little over 5 months. We had to
drop back to the points system, and all seems fine.  Does any one know if
there is a warrarnty on these systems?  It was purchased from Bus Depot.
The problem was that it was overheating and there was no way to keep the bus
running, it would just die.
&gt; Again, thanks to the list for all the help... as always, ya'll are a great
bunch.
