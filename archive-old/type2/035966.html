Subject: &quot;One-man brake bleeder&quot;

I am looking at the &quot;one-man brake bleeder&quot; in the RMMW catalog ($34.95) 
and thinking that it is doubtless way overpriced. It's a vacuum pump, 
isn't it? With a reservoir on the business end for checking bubbles?

I am guessing that by squeezing the handle, brake fluid is drawn out of 
the cylinder, bringing any bubbles with it. The air bubbles pass into the 
pump reservoir and exit through a break in the pipe (the break is 
submerged in brake fluid). 

Have I got it right? Because if I do, some clear hose, a jelly jar, and 
one of those pumps that fits on a drill chuck (8.95) will do the same job.
