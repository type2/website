Subject: RE:  Suddenly no power...

&gt;My '78 2 liter FI Westy suddenly has decided to lose power on 

&gt;Possibilities:  I checked the fuel filter, seems ok.  Battery ok.  The
&gt;only thing I've done recently was to add a can of dry gas and I used 

Clogged fuel injector?  Fouled or bad spark plug?  Try unplugging each
injector connector, one at a time, with the engine running and make sure
there is a fairly even change in idle speed for each one.  Just a thought.
