Content-Disposition: inline

I've got an Alpine 7548 and it's wonderful! I have upgraded gradually,
started with a head unit + CD changer running a pair of components
speakers and a pair of bottom-of-the-range 6x9 Alpine speakers. Recently
I fitted a V12 amp, and top-of-the-range Alpine 6x9s. The original setup
sounded good, but the latest sounds brilliant! Alpine stuff is more
expensive than others, but the sound just has a warmth, not really bassy
or trebly but just natural. All the range of the tone controls are usable
and the layout of the buttons is logical (therefore safe). Need I say
more?

To make this bus-specific, a few points about the install: I had to cut
metal from the doors to fit the components with the 6x9s. Couldn't find
any other sensible location for speakers, see. In addition, I now use
electric windows with a winder tube which curves round the speaker (the
reason being that the speaker grille would interfere with the winder
handle). Also, another safety point, I couldn't reach the passenger
window winder before!

The CD changer is on the bulkhead behind the passenger's seat and the amp
is behind the driver's seat. All is fed from a second battery, not
necessary but useful for playing whilst parked up.

RE:	to all the stereophiles out there.. Alpine question...

I'm sure a lot of people have brands that they will particularly buy, but
has anyone had good/bad experiences with Alpine stereo equipment?
