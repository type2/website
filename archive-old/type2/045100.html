Subject: [T2] Exhaust leak...

Hi all -

Well, the GEX rebuild trial run (FL to CO) was a success (whew!).  Arrived 
back in beautiful Colorado yesterday (8/31), just in time for some good 
rain.  Took the backroads the whole way.  Come mid-afternoon halfway across 
Mississippi, I realized most of my travelling would need to be done before 
1P everyday due to triple-digit temps.  Only glitch during the trip came 
late:  about 2 miles past Byers, CO, my exhaust came off the left heat 
exchanger.  No, I don't know where the bolts went.  Judging from the greatly 
altered appearance of what was a new exhaust when I first left Florida (now 
very ashy/rusty looking - is this due to the higher than normal heat of an 
enging break in?), I can only guess that heat &amp; stress contributed to the 
bolts breaking off.  Additionally, the gaskets that came w/the exhaust seem 
to have mostly disintegrated.  Dunno.  Will swap out w/the metal covered 
gaskets that came w/the rebuild.  Will also get thicker bolts.

My only other problem was a small amount of exhaust issuing forth from my 
heater vents during the whole of the trip.  As my windows were down the 
whole way &amp; I continually monitored for headache, I continued on.  When I 
first purchased this Westy, I'd noticed that, when I'd run the defrost, the 
windows would coat w/a sheen of exhaust stuff.  This was one of those things 
I was going to fix.  So, I didn't use the defrost/heat on the few occassions 
I had to drive around before I left for FL.  I noticed, after installing the 
rebuild, that the left heat &quot;flap&quot; cable (?) - connected to the duct off of 
the front of the heat exchanger - was missing its spring (judging by the 
right cable, which still had it).

Anyhow, does anyone have an idea of where I might begin to track down where 
exhaust is entering the heating ducts?  I'd used some fiberglass patch stuff 
to plug small openings on both heat exchangers, along their seams, where 
they connect to the duct going to the heat flaps.  Nothing is obviously 
disconnected, &amp; when I installed the motor, I made sure to tighten all 
exhaust related clamps.

Also, I notice I'm not idling as good as I was.  Is this due to altitude 
change?  Do I need to have timing &amp; fuel/air adusted again?  Spark plugs all 
look good (brownish color, some black carbon, evenly distributed around the 
plug &amp; on the electrodes - no &quot;misfiring, hard starting and hesitation&quot; per 
Haynes manual - am I &quot;normal&quot; or do I fall in the &quot;Carbon deposits&quot; range?)  
Can any Coloradans on this list recommend a couple of good, fairly priced VW 
mechs in Denver or Aurora (or surrounding areas)?  Anything else I 
can/should check after a trip of this length?  I took a look at the pushrod 
tubes today, &amp; it looks like a small amount of oil pushed out (on all 
eight), then glazed onto the block.  Used 1/2 qt oil during the trip, had no 
visible leaks.

Any advice is most appreciated, TIA,

Mark
