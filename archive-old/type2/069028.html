Subject: Re: cutting out in FI buses

Hi Paul &amp; other fuel injected buspeople,
  I just fixed this problem on my friend Karen's 77 bus. She'd cruise 
around, and suddenly the bus would just cut out, and no pumping of 
the gas pedal will make any difference. Then it would immediately 
fire up as if nothing happened. After replacing fuel filter and 
various vacuum hoses (which really needed to be replaced but didn.t 
solve the problem...) I found that the brake vacuum booster hose had 
come loose right were it attaches to the intake manifold. pushed that 
back in, and no problems since...
  Ciao,

I've seen a lot of posts recently about cutting out in FI buses.
I thought I'd share my experience, point of reference being a 
79 FI bus.

The first problem occurred when I would be on the highway, doing 60
mph, and on flat ground.  It would cut out for a second or two,
but then everything would be fine the rest of the trip.
This would happen every time I got on the highway.
Solution: new Bosch fuel filter and a bottle of Techron.
I pulled the fuel filter and it was gummed up.
The solution fixed that problem permanently.

Secondly, 2 years after the above problem, the engine would cut out
when going up hills in 3rd gear.  I'd have to shift to 4th, because 
the engine did not want to be at high rpm's.  By shifting to 4th, I was
lugging the engine and it was a bad situation. 
Solution: add a bottle of dry gas to the fuel.  
The problem immediately disappeared.
I probably got a &quot;bad&quot; batch of fuel...
 
BTW on 2 separate instances I found Purolator fuel filters leak.

Paul
