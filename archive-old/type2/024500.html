I would not recommend the Muir guide for maintaining a 79 F.I. 2.0L bus.
Most of the concepts in the book apply to hardware that is not even on
you're engine.  I have this book, and I also have a Bently manual for my 78
2.0L Westy.  Everyone raves about the Muir book, but after reading it, I
found that it was interesting, but not really applicable to my bus.  I know
it has been updated, but anything that did apply to my engine was an addon
to existing procedures, and at that not covered in nearly enough detail.
The first time I had a problem I needed to consult  the Bentley manual for
diagnosis and procedures for fixing the problem.  If you can only buy one
book, get the Bentley book.  If you can afford both then sure get both, but
get the Bentley book first.

Sorry
I know there will be mass disagreement on this, I guess I will just have to
live with that.....

Graham
