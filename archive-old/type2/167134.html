Subject: Front Axle Beam Adjustment

The Haynes manual only speaks about installation and replacement of the front
axle beam.  The front axle beam on my 1974 Campmobile was replaced.  Although
now the bus sits 4 or 5 inches too high in the front.  After looking at
another bus of the same year  I noticed that axle beam sits lower.  I'm not
sure if the axle beam requires adjustment or other suspension components at
the front?  Any suggestions?
