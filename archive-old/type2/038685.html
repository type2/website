Subject: Paint problems HELP!!!!

Hello everybody, I am having a problem and I think I'm tripping out
pretty hard.Last week I drove through the same mud puddle I always do
out in front of the local rock quarry, and mud spashed up on both sides
of my bus.Today when I went to wash it off I come to find out it doesn't
want to come off, it's like cement silt and it's stuck to my paint.Does
anybody out there have any tips?Do the sponges with the nylon mesh
around scratch paint?I tried good car wash, and dish soap(yikes).If I
don't get some encoaraging words tonight I fear I might not make it till
the morning..................................shoot me!!!!!!!!!
Thanks,
Casey
