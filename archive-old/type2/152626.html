Subject: Re: [T2] Automatic Transmission Leak

&gt;&gt; the torque converter area is dry. In fact, the entire transmission is
&gt;&gt; dry everywhere except for the filler tube side, from the piston cover
&gt;&gt; down to the pan. I can't really figure out where else it could be
&gt;&gt; coming from, because I don't think the ATF could leak from the pan 
&gt;&gt; seal
&gt;&gt; upwards. I also do not have any kind of diagram of the transmission
&gt;&gt; other than the tiny drawing of it in my manual.
&gt;
&gt; BTW it is the same tranny on the early vanagons.  well it could
&gt; conceviebly leak there just have never seen it myself....there is a 
&gt; pretty
&gt; good set of drawings in the VW shop manual (orange book)
&gt;

&gt;
I took my van to the mechanic today and he verified that it is the 
second gear
brake piston cover leaking and that I would be a fool to try and do it 
myself.

The bad news is that he could not get the gaskets/seals without buying 
the whole $100 kit. I told him that I would find them myself... so, if 
anyone here could help me find those, I would appreciate it! I don't 
have parts numbers or anything, but I am busy online trying to find the 
info that I need. I'm checking some of the other trans parts companies 
listed here, but it is a little confusing. BTW the machine is an 80 
Vanagon with a 3-speed, and a real leaky second gear
brake piston cover.

I sincerely appreciate anyone's help with this problem, in advance.

Be well- Herb. (Go Cardinals)
