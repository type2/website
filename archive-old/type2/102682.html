Subject: other camper conversions

Further to all this talk about Westys , does anybody know how many
companies converted buses into campers?  There must have been dozens.
Around here we have Westys, raised roofs and a local company made a
thing like a Westfalia but we call them Haney's cuz the company was in
Haney British Columbia.  There must be dozens of others like the
Kemperer, Kharman...Any manufactured around your
parts?

Just interested even though I sold my last Westfalia about 10 years ago.
