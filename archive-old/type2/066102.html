Subject: Identifying parts

I've recently acquired a 1959 pickup. Except for what appears to be a shot
clutch it is mechanically sound. There's some rust but all the pans are
nice and clean. The wheelbase has been shortened about three feet to 58&quot;.
The previous owner wasn't sure if the motor was original or not. How can I
determine this? It is a single carb motor. It appears that this has been
converted to 12v but how would I determine this also? What I would like to
do is just sell the motor/trans off and install a 1600 dual port setup,
will this fit? Thanks for any replies!
