Subject: Re: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!

 In reference to a recent post concerning a bus for sale, I did a follow-up
and found the bus had been trashed.  Please - don't scrap your buses or
beetles!!  Personally I am from Quebec, Canada where buses, yet alone spare
parts are extremely hard to find. It is a shame to send away these buses to
the scrapper as they become less and less available!!

Well, here in California, I am seeing fewer of them all the time. It is
alarming, really. I just brought home my third '71 yesterday, and my
&quot;collection&quot; is complete for now. I owned the first one already, in storage
for 16 years, and the second and third ones cost $575 and $635, with blown
engine and no engine, respectively (but new tires, good clean bodies and
good to decent upholstery overall). One is already on the road, and another
one soon. Even if you have to go out and buy or rebuild an engine, to get a
good, solid transportation car with a new engine for right at $2,000 (or
less) is not bad!
The guy that I bought the last one from says he'll get another one someday,
and I wonder where he is going to find it then.
Here in California, due to a state-sponsored program they are offering tax
credits for donating a running used car to the charities.. They are getting
scrapped, very seldom resold.. This will put a serious dent in the VW
population in short time. Does anyone else have states with programs like
this? Just curious. Jan B
