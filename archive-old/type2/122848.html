&gt; I have a question though part number
&gt; 241 853 445 is the center support for
&gt; the 64 through 67, but can anybody
&gt; tell me what part number 255 853 445 fits? My
&gt; importer has the 255 labeled as early.

I looked it up on the T1(splitwindow) parts fiche,
part &quot;241 853 445&quot; is there and it is what you
described: the center support. The &quot;255 853 445&quot; is
not mentioned on the fiche...and after some searching
I know why...

The &quot;255&quot; part is actually not a very early part but a
VERY LATE part! ;-)

It is for the vanagon Jailbars! Yes, also vanagons had
jailbars, may be not until the 1990ties but definitely
on the early vanagons. And the 'Type 255' is a Vanagon
Deluxe microbus (vehicle typenumbering on Vanagons is
very different from the baywindow and splitwindow)

I took a picture of the 1979 Vanagon microfiche so you
can see for yourself:
