Subject: [T2] quick easy  temp heat

install a cigg outlet, and buy an inverter and a little floor heater?

A friend is taking a 74 westy up to OR and is going to freeze her azz off 
unless I do something to help.

Im thinking this is going to be the quickest, easiest way to give her a 
little extra heat to stay warm along the way.

I drove up there about a month ago and my feet were the worst of all my 
parts, I figured if I could get a little 12v heater to plug into the cigg 
lighter or get an inverter and a little space heater id be all good.

whaddya think?

If theres an aftermarket heater I could install that would be just as easy 
and a little more long term, id be willing to give that a shot.

Thanks for any ideas, comments.
