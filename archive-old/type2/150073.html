Subject: It's ALIVE!  (was: RE: [T2] AIRS rescue---Engine runs fine, but
  dies when the engine is  under load.)

&gt; Got an A.I.R.S. rescue here.  We're in north Seattle, about a mile
&gt; east of greenlake.

w00000t!  We got Erin's bus running today!  Well, more specificly, the
wizards at Louis Foreign Auto in Seattle.  Most of his time was spent
undoing the &quot;damage&quot; we'd done from 4 days of tinkering and
guessing---seems that at some point when we reattached the airbox a hose
in back came out and was creating a total vacuum leak.

And then they fixed the actual problem---the contact track on the AFS
was just worn down bare under the arm so it was making lousy electrical
contact.  Dan made a slight adjustment so it tracks on a different part
of the contact, and she runs great!  Perhaps a little rich, but it'll
work well for now to get her to san francisco.

Seems my AFM is beginning to show the same problem, which is why
swapping hers with mine didn't do the trick.  This probably explains
some minor problems I was running into about two months ago.  I'll be
picking one up in the next few weeks, I suppose.  :)

Thanks to everyone on the list here who contributed to the discussion or
sent ideas to us---we tried just about all of them.  It's amazing that
this community is out there willing to help so much, and it makes me
really happy to be a part of it.

And now...we go out for a victory beer.

Here's her final comment posted to the samba thread (which can be seen
in its entirty at

SHE LIVES!!!!!

So. Apparently, my AFM *was* the problem all along; we didn't detect it
because Mike's is apparently going bad in the same place along the track
as mine -- glad we found that out before he left for Burning Man! In a
last ditch &quot;WTF is goin on here?!?!&quot; effort, Dan the Mechanical Wizard
popped it open and adjusted the arm so it's tracking in a slightly
different spot. She'll run a little rich, but she'll get me where I'm
going until I stumble upon an AFM that I can afford -- like, one that
ISN'T $375 bucks. Or until the gods of money drop a chunk of cash in my
lap. And he only charged me for a half hour of labour, too! What a guy.
So, if anyone ever needs work done in Seattle, head down to Louis
Foreign Car Repair on Roosevelt Way at 71st.

And so, with all my laundry done and after fortifying myself with the
beer I'm going to drink tonight, I'll be on my way in the morning.
Thanks everyone *so* much for all your help and support. See you all in
San Francisco!!
