Subject: Costa Rican VW Scene

Hi Everybody,
I just returned from a very nice trip to Costa Rica. I stayed wit some
people I know down there so I didnt do alot
of touristy stuff.  We did alot of driving and I saw plenty of nice
VW's. I also saw many that were barely on the road. Most people down
there dont have much money so most of the beetles and buses were just
unrestored daily drivers.  The people down there are big on music so
many of them had very nice sound systems. I saw several beetles with
large speakers mounted behind the back seat and above the engine.  Also
very few of the beetles had stock exhaust or rims. I did see some
mexi-beetles too. they are nice.   As for busses, I saw many decent
looking unrestored rust free daily drivers.  I saw only a few busses
that were very well maintained.  One of them was a beautiful split
window with what looked to be a custom wood interior.  the weird thing
was that the paint was pretty shiny and it looked real nice, but it had
several flat tires and weeds starting to grow around it.  In the city of
San Jose i saw a new VW.  It was called the Sol and it looked like a
smaller, rounder golf. more like a Lupo.  I come from NJ where an
aircooled VW is a rare sight and going there i saw plenty on the road. 
Probably several a day.     I also definately reccommend Costa Rica as a
travel destination. It is absolutely beautiful and the climate is very
friendly to our beloved VW's.
