Subject: [T2] Directionable Heat

Well the heatings working a treat thanks to all who helped I shall be warm
all the way to Wales this evening.
Why is it always the smallest part of the job that takes all your patience
and time. (Little white plastic bit wouldn't go back into U in bracket near
exchangers).

There's just one more thing.

At first I wasn't bothered about the fact that the cable which switched the
heat from the windscreen to the feet and back into the passenger area was
broken. I was told by a very good van mechanic that the cable was not
available anymore.
I noticed that the L shaped attatchment on this third cable was identical to
the one that I attatched to the heater lever.
HAS ANYONE TRIED USING ONE OF THESE WIRES TO REPLACE THIS CABLE.
I know it sounds cheap but I don't want to splash out on the cable just to
find out that there is an inherent problem.

OR does anyone have the bit of cable I'm talking about. The problem is just
that the cable is bent and so won't push down the tube. It's not life
threatening, it's not even really important. But it doesn't work. I'm sure
you all understand.

Thanks Again
