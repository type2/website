Subject: hoses for FI engines

My immediate problem is with a '79 bug but I'm hoping that it shares
certain hose sizes with a bus. So here goes.

Over the years of carbureted vw repair, I thought I had accumulated every
size hose I needed .  2mm, 3mm, 5mm, etc.  Son drives his Ghia in with a
leaking gas line? No problem. Head for my box.  Vacuum line leaking? Again,
just cut a few inches off the 2 meters I happen to have on hand.

Then I went to work on my '79 which has FI.  I measured the ID of the hoses
which run everywhere on that engine and  now find that I need 10mm, 12mm,
and 14mm sizes.  So much for my smugness.

I've looked through my catalogs and don't see any of those sizes listed.

Can anyone suggest a source?

Jack
