&gt;Sorry for re-posting this, but I'm really stuck for an
&gt;answer. Can anyone help at all? Summary: Am I correct
&gt;in thinking that a '72-'74 EGR filter will *not* fit
&gt;on my '78 that has a '72-'74 exhaust conversion? (the
&gt;original '78 filter doesn't fit)

The 72-74 filter has to bolt to the dual carb intake. (I think it should read 73-74 because I don't think 72 models had EGR).

The 75-78 filter connects to a pipe through the tin that runs to the throttle body.

I think you'll have to make modifications if you have an FI bus with a 72-74 exhaust setup. I'm not sure where the 73-74 filter breaches the engine tin.
