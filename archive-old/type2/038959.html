Niall:

I've seen this before, also on the left side case half.  As far as I know,
it doesn't indicate a thing about the state of the case and just seems to be
an artifact of the casting process..  If you're doing a complete tear-down,
inspect the case carefully on the *inside* for problems.

&gt; Just got Frances' engine down to long block stage and started cleaning off
&gt; 24 years of grime.  I noticed immediately that the surface of the case is
&gt; covered in what appear to be small cracks that look like they've oozed
&gt; molten aluminum (my worst fears are embellishing the description
somewhat).
&gt; Being a newbie, I'm wondering whether this is from the casting process or
is
&gt; my case really toast?
