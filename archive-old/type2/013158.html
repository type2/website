&gt; But I can't remember what they attach to!  I remembered the fuel tank
&gt; breather lines (to a little 't' on the top), but want to get these last two
&gt; hoses on the right place.  Bentley doesn't address it, other than
&gt; maintenance periodicity.
	on my 79 the top line goes to the hose bibb on top of the air tube
just past the air filter. The bottom one goes to the bibb on the tin
that covers the passenger side cylinders.
