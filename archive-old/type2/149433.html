&gt; &gt;Alternatively you can try to install the left caliper on the right and
&gt; &gt;vice versa. I *think* they are symmetric for 71-72 but not positive.
&gt; &gt;Others please correct me.
&gt;
&gt;71-72 calipers can be mounted on the wrong wheel. The calipers may have L/R 
&gt;markings on them and the bleeder screw should be on top if there is only 
&gt;one.

RE: '72 Westy -

Thanks all.  That was it.  Last night, after I swapped the calipers, I had 
my son do the brake pedal dance while I bled the calipers.  Bill, the 
locating bolt is now on the bottom .  And I did mark them left &amp; right per 
the rebuilder's designation on the packing box.

The first caliper has some major air bubbles in it, but it was only after I 
did the second one that the brake pedal came to life.

I think the second one had the more significant air pocket, but I did not 
get a real good visual on the departing air because I did not have any brake 
fluid in my bleeding hose to see the air bubbles.  But it did seem like 
someone breaking wind in the swimming pool!!  So, my lesson learned is that 
I should have had sufficient clear vinyl hose that I could fill with brake 
fluid, and put a few appropriate bends in the clear vinyl hose so I could 
capture how much air came out of the calipers / cylinders.

Can anyone imagine a simple procedure that would give this configuration: a 
bent vinyl hose that is full of brake fluid and will capture any air bubble 
being released??  Richard??  Bill?? Arnaud??

Thanks again.

Oh, BTW, I did cut down my emergency brake handle pull to about 1/2 by 
tightening up on the individual brake cable that was causing the yoke to be 
cockeyed.  It seems that cable must have stretched about 2 inches, since it 
is that much longer than the other one with the yoke perpendicular.  It is 
time for replacements, I know....

I WILL check out the yoke on my other vehicles.
