Subject: [T2] ECU used with autotranny

Is it true that you need a specific ECU to run FI with an automatic 
transmission.  If you used an ECU from a standard shift bus what would 
happen?  Any info greatly appreciated.  Why is it that I always get into VW 
projects as winter approaches in the midwest?  Later, Marcus
