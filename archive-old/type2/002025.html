Subject: Rough idle on 82 westy

   Hi,

     I am desperate.  I do not know what is left.  Last night I replaced my
points with the Pertronix with no change in idle.  This is going to be long
because I want to re-iterate what I have done to solve this problem.  This
is a 82 air-cooled Federal emissions 2.0L FI westy with a rough, unsteady
idle &amp; hesitation.  I redid the compression test with a new compression
tester &amp; this is what I got:

1. 115
2. 120
3. 120
4. 120

     I have changed the plugs, points (now Pertronix) wires, cap, rotor,
AFM, Cold Start Valve, injector seals, coil, all small vacuum lines, Head
sensor.  The timing is right at 7.5 BTDC.  The FI system has been tested via
the Bentley method 3 times.  I have checked the grounds, continuity of the
FI harness.  In spite of all this, it still will not idle &amp; run right.  I
have never had such problems with a bus &amp; I have had a lot of them.  Any
ideas besides selling it, which I have already thought of but like it too
much.  I just don't know what to do or even a direction to look at.
