    I've got a 4.86 in my 002 tranny with a .81 4th gear. Don't have a
tach, but this ratio works pretty well. I can take off in 2nd with no
problem if I wish, and still cruise at 70-75 with no strain. I notice a
little bit less acceleration ability in 4th, but it's not bad, and once
I'm up to 65-70 it makes no difference. I'd wanted a 4.57, but think now
that the .81 4th is good enough for the time being. 
The tires are stock for now.
