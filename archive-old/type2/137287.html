Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

With Netscape I can sort by date, subject, sender, or thread. I read
what interests me, save what is useful, then &quot;select all&quot; and delete. 
My zap finger is not tired.  If I really dislike a poster, I don't even
see their subject line- just use a message filter to zap 'em as they
download.  Haven't really had to do that for this list, bur with such an
attitude, your ID may be the first.
