Subject: Oil Pressure Light

Hello All,

My engine has developed a disturbing habit. When started after a rest of
more than a few hours, the red oil light will often take longer than 5
seconds to go out, and when it does go out, it flutters.

I have a 10K AVP, and I run 15W/40 Synthetic. For filters I use the Mahle
&gt;from BD.

I broke the engine in on the Synthetic and it did take a long time for the
rings to seat. I do not actually think that they have completely seated yet,
but my oil consumption has finally dropped to 1/2qt every 3K.

No other abnormal symptoms. Except, if I leave it set for a week it can take
quite a while for the lifters to stop clattering.

Any suggestions?
