Subject: Re: [T2] She doesn't want to go camping?!

&gt;So... with that in mind... short of getting a new future wife, is there any
&gt;way to convince the SO to go on a camping trip. EVEN if it's just for one
&gt;day? Anyone had any experience with that? Hell.. I'd have no problems
&gt;sleeping in the Bus. I'd do it for a month if I needed to.

Find a beach an hour or so away with a nearby campground.........Arrange for 
a loose sparkplug wire to make the engine run really crappy requiring a 
nights stay at the campground......(you better plan ahead with extra clothes 
stashed in the camper) and make sure you have enough food and beverages for 
the night......In the morning you can fix the engine and drive 
home.......you just have to put off fixing the engine till the morning.

Depending on your wifes attitude following the little breakdown/campout you 
can either sell the bus and by a new S.U.V. for the trips to the beach or 
sell her and buy another VW and do more campouts.
