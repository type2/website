Subject: Speaking of Mexico (was RE: [T2] Used Mexican Bus?)

This thread on Mexi-buses reminded me of a question
I've been meaning to ask:  If I were to go to Mexico, would
I have any problem coming back into the US with a small truckload
of things like new cylinder heads, P/Cs, rods, etc...?

Also, I assume these things are available at Mexican parts houses, what
types of prices could I expect?  Would it be worth the trip/trouble?

Thanks,

Rob
