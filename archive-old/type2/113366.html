Subject: RE: [T2] Help with mystery leak

&gt; There is no slipping at all.  The clutch and engine are performing great.
&gt; I've had no loss of power at all.  If it is the engine seal, how do I go
&gt; about fixing it?  Do I need to just keep adding oil to it until I fix it?

Drop the engine. Remove the flywheel. Remove the old seal. Clean everything
up. Install the new seal. Reinstall the flywheel. Reinstall the engine. No
problems!

I've done it in my front yard in about four hours - but I had just had the
engine out and in three times in two weeks...

The rear main seal (as that one is officially called) is rather important. If
it goes out completely while you're on the Interstate, you main freeze up your
engine before you noticed that all your engine just lost all it's oil (make
sure your idiot light works). The seal might go tomorrow and it might last
50,000 miles. It's your call.

-Eric

P.S. I carry enough tools in the bus to remove the engine on the side to the
road...
