Subject: Re: [T2] Fair price for instrument panel?

I don't agree. $100 is a good price for a panel (assuming that 
everything's working) purchased locally. No hassling with &quot;shipping and 
handling&quot;), no wondering whether you'll get what you paid for. And $10 
is too little to pay for a complete working panel.

&gt; I'll bet you can find one for $10, maybe $20.
