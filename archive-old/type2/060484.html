Subject: Dead Bus Lives!

The bus that died on Halloween night lives!  Possible guesses included the
alternator, the regulator, and a short.  Oh boy was it ever a short.

About three weeks ago I was rooting around in the engine compartment of my
new bus when I found several .5&quot; diameter sticks wedged in around the
battery.  I laughed and imagined some camper in the woods finding what he
could to keep his battery in place, and took them out, thinking they could
too easily get loose and cause trouble. 
Well while hooking up the battery charger last night, I found out what I
had done.  Those sticks had a good purpose all right.  They kept the
positive terminal from grounding against the body.  Talk about a short.  My
only excuse for not noticing this before is that it's dark around here
after work these days.

So, after a charge, The Colonel starts better than he has in the last three
weeks!
