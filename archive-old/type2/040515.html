Ok its Friday...

Yesterday I was in one of those electonic superstore (the Future
kind...)

There was a video clip playing on all of the TVs, must be a new one from
Hansen I beleive which is featuring a grey or beige early type2.
It was pretty cool to see it over the entire wall of TVs...  It kinda
left a big impression on me, spining wheels in the desert...

Anyways, have a good weekend
