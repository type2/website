&gt; Be careful on how this is done.  Pulling the ball joints can be done
&gt; using rented tools. Replacing the ball joints, however, requires a
&gt; special tool and heavy duty press to swage over the top of the ball
&gt; joint onto the arm.  If this isn't done the ball joint could pull out of
&gt; the arm at maximum downward travel.
