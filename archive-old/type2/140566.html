Subject: Bus Depot Aux Battery Relay

So I mounted my spare battery today with the relay kit from bus depot.  What 
is wrong with using the wire from the coil that is positive when the bus is 
running.  One side of the coil is hot when the key is turned on - both sides 
are hot when the bus is running.  I connected to the side that is hot only 
when the bus is running.

Is there a problem with that?  Someone said that there was ... but if so ... 
what is it?
