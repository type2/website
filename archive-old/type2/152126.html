&gt; Eberspracher in mine which was quickly removed.  My questions:
&gt;
&gt; Is this technology safe?  Shutoff switches etc.
&gt; Does it use a lot of Gas?  How efficient are the BN2's

maybe a pint an hour in very cold weather

&gt; What is a BN4 and does it fit in a Westy?.

there are BN2,4, and BA 2,4,6 all will fit with enough cut and paste

&gt; I went to Eberspracher's website and checked it out.  Are any of the new
&gt; products available in the US and fit in a Westy?  My German was not good
&gt; enough and the Google Translate version of the page was laughable at best.

American division is under the name ESPAR  check it out. and yes their
&quot;airtop&quot; heaters work fantastic, but are pricy.
