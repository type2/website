Subject: Need for Emission Control on 71 Bus

In 1978 I owned a 71 bus that had all the emission control equipment 
operating.  It had the throttle valve positioner, altitude corrector and 
advance/retard distributor.

Twenty two years later I am restoring a recently acquired 71 VW bus that has 
none of the emission control stuff on the engine.  Not a big deal because 
the bus is too old to need an emissions sticker.  I also have all of the 
emission control stuff acquired from a used 73 engine that was recently 
given to me.  Everything is in great condition except the short block.  
Later this summer I plan to buy a new long block and use parts from the 73 
to finish the job.

My question is should I bother to install the emission control parts or 
forget it and plug the vacuum lines like most VW owners seem to do these 
days?  If you can make the emission control equipment work properly, is 
there any benefit to having it if you don't need to get the vehicle 
inspected?
