&gt; Some cue to the material on Sportsmobile pop-ups would also be
&gt; appreciated.  I personally can't tell if it's coated canvas or some
&gt; sort of vinyl.  I've got a few surface cracks and a couple small holes

I think it's a sort of sunbrella material. Tough stuff though. As far
as the screens I believe you would need to pull the top &amp; canvas off
the bus and take it to a upholstery shop.
