Subject: Re: [T2] Starter

NO!   The self supporting starter will NOT work on a 2.0L with a 228mm flywheel.
No way no how. If he has a 76, he has a 228 flywheel. It will not engage the
teeth. It will work on a 2.0L with an auto trans.

&gt; &gt;Hey! All
&gt; &gt;This is my First post and i'm a newbie to VW
&gt; &gt;I have a 76 Loaf with a siezed starter motor.
&gt; &gt;a new Bosch is $100. one from my FLAP is $60.
&gt; &gt;I can't shell out the scratch for the Good one, and i don't trust the cheap
&gt; &gt;one.
&gt; &gt;SO can my old 722 Bosch starter motor be rebuilted? and how difficult is the
&gt; &gt;process of rebiulting it?       Thanks   Gary VW
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Costs about a $100 time/money to actually do it right by anyone who
&gt; actually knows how. If your a manual tranny, spend $50 more and get the
&gt; SR17X which is stock for the automatics. Much more robust motor. An
&gt; approved alternative for the T-IV motor and also stock on the 911 Porsche,
&gt; so you know it's been proven at LeMans. 911's don't need extra relays to
&gt; keep the starter starting. The cheapest motor you can by when time/money
&gt; per mile with no problems is controlling. Beg/borrow or steal the money to
&gt; do it right and you'll have the money you need when you retire. Cheap out
&gt; and you lose all your life by paying a premium for unnecessary redo's and
&gt; repairs, and end up in retirement with a pittance.
&gt;
&gt; Get a junk yard motor for now and save your nickles till you have enough to
&gt; do it right. It will be a much smaller loss than the FLAPS loss leader
&gt; junk, if not for sure, at least to a 2 sigma certanity.
