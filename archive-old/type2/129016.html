Subject: Re: [T2] Why dwell would vary with RPM?

 From the Bentley Manual:

Run the engine at about 2000 RPM.  The dwell should not vary more than 
+-1 degree from the first reading [at 1000 RPM].  Larger deviations 
indicate a worn distributor shaft.

the dizzy installed. Again it
&gt; appeared to be .016. Started up and still about 46, but I noted that when I
&gt; increased the RPM the dwell went to 49.5??
&gt; 
&gt; Any input? I am tired and confused. I have a spare 009 but one of the return
&gt; springs is broken so have no idea what the advance curve will be.
