Subject: WTB: Spicerack

VanBondo sez:
I need to complete the &quot;good kharma&quot; circle here.

After looking forever, I was happy to receive basically a flat out gift of a
spicerack from Michael Heron and from someone else, I think either the fella
in central Florida who recently put up a very nice web page &lt;Kevin Murray or
Murphy??&gt; or maybe Unca Joel or someone (sorry its been awhile).
I will need to use parts off of both plus will have to relaminate some extra
Formica from a junk SO-42 cabinet in order to make one reasonable spice rack.
I will take tracings and or measurements off of what I have in case anyone
is planning on building their own. This will definitely *NOT* happen prior
to the first of the year. I will post the availability of these &quot;plans&quot; when
its time.

BTW: I am constantly looking at swap meets for an upgrade to the SO-42 Westy
cabinets that I have and haven't seen a stitch much less a &quot;What-not&quot;
spicerack! A definite &quot;good luck&quot; on that and the hard plastic grey trim
that goes around the cut-out for the poptop in the 65-67 Westys...
