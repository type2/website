Subject: [T2] Starter problem

I have a 72 bus and the power all works in it put when I turn the key the 
final turn to start it nothing happens.  I think its an electrical problem.  
It's a fairly new starter (6 months old) so I don't think its that.  Is there 
a main wire that I should check? Or anthing else that could be doing this?  

Thank You,
Jon
