&gt; Anyway, I've seen a lot of disconnected egr's on buses too. I assume they are  
&gt; either on their last two years of life, or they know a dishonest smog technician
&gt; I haven't met yet, or they are cruising for an expensive last minute purchase 
&gt; and repair like Lee just endured.

&gt; Hey Lee, does your bus run cooler now? I haven't driven far enough to notice
&gt; yet with mine. Any power or mileage changes?

&gt; Drive safely,

I just took my 1976 Westalia with 110,000 miles through one of the State run 
emissions testing facilities here in Ohio. The engine has not had an EGR valve
since 1982 and has never run hot. The testing in Ohio is at the tailpipe only.
There are 2 tests that pre-1981 cars must pass. First the vehicle is put on
a chassis roll dyno and run at a road speed of 30 to 35 MPH. A hose collects
the exhaust during the 60 second &quot;run&quot;. Step two is a 80 second idle collection of
exhaust gases. The limits of emissions for a 1976 type with 110,000 miles are:

HC loaded    450 PPM
CO loaded     5.0%
HC idle      450 PPM
CO idle       5.0%

My results were: 
HC loaded = 104.0 PPM
CO loaded =  1.04%
HC idle   =  400.0 PPM
CO idle   =  5.97%  *****FAILED*****

After a trip to the visit the guys at Autohaffen to use their Sun gas analyzer
and a few turns out (to make it leaner - its an air bleed screw) on the idle 
mixure we were ready for a retest. I have never touched this adjuster screw on
the airbox.

The retest passed with good results:
HC loaded = 80.0 PPM
CO loaded =  1.04%
HC idle   =  216.0 PPM
CO idle   =  1.6%

I guess the point of all these details are that the highest emissions occur when
a vehicle is at idle. The EGR valve on type2s are controled by a lever and
allow gases to pass into the intake manifold until the throttle is opened a
given amount. Notice that the CO reading did not change after the adjustment.
I am glad that my type2 is putting out less CO and HC but I am not sorry that I
don't have an EGR valve. Two years from now they are suppose to check for
emission components. What the market like for EGR valves?
           
How does that test compare to tests done on other states? 
What kind of tests do you guys in Calf. have to pass?
