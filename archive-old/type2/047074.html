Subject: Re: [T2] ARRRRGGHHHH! Shock replacement!!!!

Courtney,

Don't do it!!!  the center sleeve is supposed to be bonded to the rubber
bushing (originally your old one was) and that bushing coming unbonded is
one of the big reasons for rear end clatter (which someone else is
currently complaining of).  

My approach to removing those sleeves is pretty BFMI (brute force, massive
ignorance :-)....  First, penetrating oil, lots of it.  I recommend Kroil,
it is the best brand I have found.  Then sock a vice-grip on it and twist
it to break the rust loose.  If that does not work, stage 2 is (more
Kroil, then) take a cold chisel and look for the seam in it.  Bang the
cold chisel at an angle to the seam.  If *that* does not work, then (more
Kroil, get the Fire Extinguisher and) the blow torch comes out and I hit
the sleeve with the blow torch.  Then (more Kroil and) the vise-grip again
or the cold chisel.

Note that in my experience, these sleeves are constructed of rolled steel
and that the join is not welded.  YMMV, I have not dealt with every brand
of shock.  When you are using the cold chisel and sledge, what you are
trying to do is to peel it off, adjust the angle of the chisel to do that.
I have tried to illustrate below:

                          | \O  |
                          |     |
                           \   /
                            ---

&gt; I have two KYB GR2 gas shocks to put on my 70 bug, but when I took the old
&gt; ones off, the bottom steel spacer/bushing stayed on the bottom torsion arm
&gt; on the shock mounting! I thought &quot;no problemo, I'll just drive the
&gt; spacer/bushing out of the new KYB shock and put it on with the old bushing
&gt; still stuck there, but no way can I drive it out! Suggestions? I don't have
&gt; access to heat to try to free up the old bushing, but I have a
&gt; dremel/grinder, can I carefully cut this old bushing away? Is there
&gt; something I'm missing re: driving out the new bushing on the KYB shock? It
&gt; is NOT moving either!
&gt; HELP!
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Courtney
