Subject: the dreaded hesitation revisited

hi all - changing the fuel pump helped me get the 75 rolling, but also made
me realize i can not be confident taking it beyond town quite yet. two
things, possibly related, which i'd like to discuss here with you. i notice
the ALT LIGHT comes on when 1) the headlights are on and my foot is on the
brake pedal - stop signs, red lights; 2) if headlights are on, inbetween
ticks of the turn blinkers; and 3) at higher revs in higher gears. its not
limited to this, in that that's all the data i caught on a 10 mile/10pm run
around the town. in addition coupled with this alternator light biz, i am
getting the dreaded hesitation like this: halfway through second gear it
feels like fuel starvation. same spot during third, and fourth gears as
well. new fuel filter with less than a 20 miles on it. the dwell is right
on 50, and otherwise it has great pickup and it runs very smoothly. this 75
was tuned less than a few hundred miles ago. do you see any related things
here? alt light and hesitatations? if no, don't let that keep from
expressing opinions. THANKS!!!  - steve
