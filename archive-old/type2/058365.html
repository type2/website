Subject: more on &quot;the&quot; FULL FLOW oil modification
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Well... I ignored all of your advice and pushed it through to where I needed
it.

I do have a void where it hit that internal drilled hole to the (plugged) 30mm
oil pump. I felt around in this passage, (before pushing on) and there are no
other passages leading off of it so I am 100% positive that this passage was
only used to get oil from the normal pump to the mains... the same place the
full flow enters.

This irregular (ungodly) opening that I created I am going to fill up with JB
weld, or some other kind of sealer. This area will also be sealed by my full
flow fitting 100% leaving about 3/16 + of metal going past the (down to oil
pump) hole and into the case. I believe it will work fine. (Your/the original
fitting [before my modification] would have closed off a good majority of this
hole as well, so it truly served no other purpose)

I will have to ream (drill) the hole deeper a 1/4&quot; and have to tap it again
with the 3/8 NPT, and I found out what the NPT means (National Pipe Thread) in
other words not available at an automotive or hardware store... So here is a
request that I have:

Before I head down to pay Peter the Plumber does anyone have the ream ... but
more importantly the 3/8 NPT tap that they want to sell me... or lend me. I
will keep the list posted on my progress... today I'm heading to find some
fresh JB Weld to fill that void with... I have used the stuff before with
excellent results... and you can tap threads into the stuff. But this hole
filling is a precautionary measure... the fitting will go deep enough (and
with a good application of Loctite) to seal an oil leak.

Thank? For the advice ???

Michael (hoping to find that tap... cheap or free !)
