Subject: Re: [T2] Manual trans fluid

I have stayed away from this discussion until I could find the name brand
product that advertises their wonder pus contains the latest and greatest
thing since sliced bread:  MT-1. But on the container it says: &quot;Do not use in
manual transmissions&quot;. But I have struck out all week. It seems to have been
removed from the market.
So instead, I will send you here:

Scroll down to API Category MT-1 and read it. The second paragraph is very
interesting. I will paste it here:

&quot;API Category MT-1

Numerous performance specifications can be used to identify the level of
protection that will be provided by an automotive gear lubricant. In the past,
API Category GL-4 was commonly used to describe the type of lubricants that
would provide acceptable performance in manual transmissions and lightly
loaded final drive axles. API Category GL-5 described lubricants that were
generally used in final drive axles operating in moderate to severe service.
However, several new performance specifications are becoming the benchmark for
describing lubricant quality.

API Category MT-1, which was issued in 1995, describes the performance
requirements of lubricants intended for use in non-synchronized manual
transmissions, such as those found in heavy-duty trucks and buses. Lubricants
meeting the requirements of API Category MT-1 provide protection against the
combination of thermal degradation, component wear, and oil seal
deterioration, which is not provided by lubricants meeting only the
requirements of API GL-1 through GL-5.&quot;

Keep reading the sentance that says &quot; Category MT-1, which was issued in 1995,
describes the performance requirements of lubricants intended for use in
non-synchronized manual transmissions, such as those found in heavy-duty
trucks and buses&quot;  and remember that ALL bay window buses have synchros.

If you click on the MT-1 link in the 2nd paragraph, it takes you to a chart.
Nothing in that chart mentions any test for GL4. It does mention ASTM D-130
and it says: &quot;Stability in the presence of copper and copper alloys&quot; but NON
synchro transmissions would not have copper or brass or bronze alloys. The *
says  &quot;ASTM copper corrosion requirement is more severe for API MT-1and
MIL-PRF-2105E/SAE J2360 than in MIL-L-2105D.&quot; But I have not figured out what
they mean by that. But D and E do not apply to a VW transaxle.
The 68-79 Bentley does not specify the MIL requirement but the 80-85 Vanagon
Bentley does for the 091 trans which almost the same as a late bay trans. The
transaxle lubricant listed is API GL-4, MIL-L-2105. The differential in the
auto trans requires API GL-5, MIL-L2105B. As far as I can find, these have not
been superceded by C, or D, or E etc.

Here is some info from Pennzoil:

http://www.pennzoil_dot_com/TechData/Pdsheet/DomesticMarketing/Gear&amp;Transmission/p
df/GL-4GearLubricant.PDF
Yes, they specifically make GL-4 for among other vehicles, Volkswagen!

Here is another paragraph from another Pennzoil site:
http://www.pennzoil_dot_com/carcare/faq/default.htm#4

&quot;2. What happens if API GL-5 gear oil is used in an API GL-4 gear oil
application?

API GL-4 and API GL-5 products typically use the same extreme pressure (EP)
additive system, with the API GL-5 having about twice the concentration of a
API GL-4. In service, these additives become active under extreme load and
temperature when the protective oil film can be squeezed away. EP additives
work by forming wear-resistant compounds with the metal of the gear tooth
surface. As the gears mesh, these compounds shield the gear teeth from direct
metal-to-metal contact that would cause wear and damage to the gears. If too
little of the active additive is present, proper protection would be
compromised. Too much of this additive could cause excessive chemical
corrosion of the gear surface. If an API GL-5 gear oil is used in a
application where API GL-4 gear oil is called for, chemical corrosion of
&quot;yellow metal&quot; components may occur, such as bronze synchronizers, brass
bushings, etc. This may lead to shifting difficulties or shortened equipment
life.&quot;

Bottom line? Straight GL-4 or Redline MT90. I cannot find any truth to any of
the MT-1 mumbo jumbo. I wish I could find the product that says it is MT-1 but
do not use it in a manual trans. Sorry. I have looked for it all week. It was
out there.....

&gt; Hi Jim
&gt;
&gt; Well,, if the link I provided before wasn't good enough,, then I can't say
any
&gt; more,,,,
&gt; other than no apparent troubles in my Vw .....
&gt; I think the key words in this spec sheet are &quot;inorganic borate compound&quot; ...
&gt; what can I say,,  works for me,, do you have reason to believe the mfg.
would
&gt; specifically lie to me ??

&gt; &gt; &gt; i did some research, and come up with a fluid I was told is OK for the
Vw
&gt; &gt; &gt; trans even though it has a GL-5 rating,,,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 80w-90 Chevron Delo Gear Lubricant ESI  API service GL-4 / GL-5 / MT-1
&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I'd pass it on to see if anyone has comments ??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Who told you that? If this isn't synthetic gear lube and it has a GL-5
&gt; &gt; rating, it contains the synchro-eating additives.
