Well, I heard it threw the grape vine that two more vehicles of interest are 
soon to be on the market possibly.  One is a 1969 Bay Window Crew Cab, in 
decent shape, needs restoration, but is complete and currently on the road 
just not driven daily.  But hey an extra bench for the kids and a place to 
keep a few kegs of beer and lots of camping gear.  Next is a 65 Split Window, 
with many 67 parts, front axle, side doors, side panels and some others, also 
registered and driven just not daily.  Now heres the catch.  I am still 
chillin in Germany, so if your serious than drop an email.  Both can be had 
an awesome price.  
Increase the Peace
