Subject: Re: [T2] timing the SVDA

Hi Paul,

I recently installed a new SVDA on my 1600 engine w/ dual carbs. One was
modified to provide advance vacuum. I bought the distributor from
Aircooled_dot_net who provided installation and timing information. Here's
the timing part:

&quot;If you have a timing light, get the car started up, you want 7.5 BTDC
at idle, the hose connected or not should not matter (if it does that's
the wrong vacuum port). After you set that, reconnect the vacuum line.
Depending on where your timing was at idle with your old distributor,
you may need to re-set your carb. To verify the correct operation of the
SVDA, the timing should be

&quot;A) 7.5 at idle
&quot;B) 32 Total Advance (hose disconnected)_at_ 3500 RPM.
&quot;C) 42-45 Total Advance (hose connected)_at_ 3500 RPM.

&quot;If the A and B timing settings vary, go with the B setting (at 3500
RPM) to set your timing. Full centrifugal advance is more important then
the idle timing.

&quot;Do NOT be alarmed if you do not get the full amount of vacuum advance
coming in right away. The vac advance diaphragm is new and is VERY
STIFF, it make take up to a month of driving (A month sitting in your
driveway or garage is not the same) to loosen up as it's used.&quot;

I hope this helps,

Mike Rocket J Squirrel
