Subject: 1968 Bus

Hello all,

I am new to the whole Volkswagen experience, and I just purchased a 1968 Bus
for $1500.  The engine seemed kind of worn out, and we couldn't’t get
adequate
power.  Tried to adjust the timing to no avail.  The guy I bought it from is
really into VWs, and so we switched the engine out for one he knew ran well.
Now it runs really nicely, but only after warming up quite a bit (20+
minutes).  If I try to drive it sooner, it will practically stall and it
goes nowhere fast.  Is this normal?  What can I do to help this warm-up
process?  Thanks in advance,

Dave
