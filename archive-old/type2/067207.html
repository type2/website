&gt; Hi All!
&gt; greetings from a very windswept aircooled Scotland!
&gt; I've only just joined the list and look forward to getting (and giving) a lot
&gt; of relevant info.
&gt; I have owned a 74 Beetle for 3 years now and have just bought my first van -
&gt; a 65 Devon which I bought for #500 (about $800) a month ago. I have given
&gt; myself up until next September to get her roadworthy and comfortable. The
&gt; main problems I must overcome in the meantime are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1 - Stripping down the hidous quarter-inch thick layer of sand primer and
&gt; original blue paint down to bare metal and,
&gt; 2 - Rewiring the whole van as the loom has been ripped out at some stage and
&gt; now has bits missing and finally
&gt; 3 - finding enough spare parts as is necessary to complete the job!
&gt; 
&gt; basically, the interior is original (i.e. with Easicool fridge and Dudley
&gt; cooker) and the bodywork is very solid although there are a few holes here
&gt; and there i.e the battery tray and roof front airvent grill.
&gt; 
&gt; So here come my first set of questions for the 'board -
&gt; 1 - How much would an equivalent van cost in the U.S. ?
&gt; 2 - What's the best way to get the paint off ?
&gt; 3 - How much is an original Devon interior worth ?
&gt; 4 - Where can I get hold of a Wiring Diagram ? (I don't getting one from the
&gt; U.S. if necessary) and
&gt; 5 - Does anyone know where I can get a kind of &quot;plan&quot; of a bus showing
&gt; lengths, widths, floorspace etc as I'm going to design a new kind of interior
&gt; for her, money permitting?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you all for your time and I look forward to becoming actively involved
&gt; in all the lists' activities.
&gt; Cheerio

Dave - 

good to hear from someone else in the UK - as far as your van goes, I'm
in the middle of doing much the same thing to my '68 Devon - I'm
actually nearing the end of the process.

Questions...

1. dunno

2. a) sand blast the shit out of it - good fun!
   b) sand paper it - a killer!
   c) pay someone else to do it!

3. don't know either, but I'll take the firdge off your hands if you're
selling it....?

4. I *think* the wiring diaram is in Bentley (get it from VW BOOKS - see
any VW magazine) - failing that, write to VW

5. ditto

Look forward to hearing how you get on - GOOD LUCK! And let me know
about the fridge!

Jonathan.
