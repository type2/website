Subject: Re: [T2] A SHORT SURVEY

Hey, Matt, thanks!!

This was the answer I was looking for!!

BUT....

I thought it was the POWER cable that would give you the spark if there was 
a short.  I really don't remember, but I did go through this a while ago, 
with pulling each fuse to find the circuit that was giving me the spark.  I 
did isolate the single problematic circuit this way.

But I am probably in error, in thinking it was the POWER cable that would 
spark.  Because last night I went through the routine of sparking the 
positive power cable to the post each time I pulled a fuse until I pulled 
ALL 12 fuses, and still got a spark!!

I know, it does not make sense, but with all the fuses pulled, I was still 
getting the 'key in &amp; door open' warning buzzer.

I guess tonight I will try pulling fuses, testing the Negative Ground cable 
for sparks, to see if that makes any difference.

&gt;
&gt;if you take the ground cable off your battery and make sure the things are
&gt;clean, when you touch it back to the battery you should NOT get any
&gt;sparking, if you do, there is a pull in your current and you have a short.
