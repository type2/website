&gt;I was thinking about getting some new plug wires for

&gt;name).

Maybe someone has a historical perspective here but wouldn't it be weird that every part of your ignition and fuel injection system was Bosch except for the wires?

&gt;Any thoughts?  Are the Bosch wires good?  What would
&gt;the OEM wires be?  

You can't go wrong with Bosch. 09171 is the set you want.
