Subject: Keeping a Manual Transmision Alive

I was checking out the Muir book today and see that he recommends adding magic
juice to trannies to prolong life.  It seems that my '87 Jetta is experiencing
the very same grinds, growls and popping out of gears that describes for
air-cooled transmissions in the 'Idiot book'.

I did a flush of the fluids and managed to keep my vehicle running ok for now,
but I am curious... has anyone had any success using  Muir's method?  If so,
what kind of juice did you put into your bus VW tranny to keep it running?  I
can only find magic juice for automatics.

Thanks!
Shawn.
