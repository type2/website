Subject: UK VW Camper Magazine

Hi, I'm just wondering if anyone has gotten Issue 15 of VW Camper &amp;
Comercial?  I renewed this last Jan. &amp; when I received my Issue 14 there
was a paper in it saying my subscription had expired!  Please send an email
my way if you received the new issue, or if you know what I can do to make
sure I get the 4 issues I paid for.  I've already emailed them (quite
awhile ago), but haven't heard anything.

thanks &amp; happy busing,
Keri
