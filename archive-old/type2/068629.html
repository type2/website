Mike,

AssCo's current catalog (#94) does not list the thermostats I used with my
oil cooler but their item #1877, Thermostat, A-710, $2.00 each,  would do
just as well.  It is adjustable from 180 to 400 degrees F. and appears to be
well made.

They have a $10.00 minimum so it may be best to get their catalog, see if
they've anything else you can use.

As with any fire sensor, take pains to insure any fire does not disable the
sensor before it can trigger the alarm.
