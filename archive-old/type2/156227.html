Subject: Re: [T2] Ozark Trail 11'x8' 'Dining Canopy on clearance at  
  Wally World

That's a neat site.  It's interesting to me that I'm 44 years old  and for all of my life  'Made in Japan' has signified quality to  me.  I'm sure that wasn't true right after WWII but it didn't take  them long to get it together.  Lets face it, a Toyota Corolla will  outlast and be cheaper to maintain than any American car by probably 3  to 1.  I had a friend who put over 300,000 on one and it was still  going strong when he totalled it.  And it saved his life at  that.  Even the Germans can't compete when you consider what a  premium you pay for a German-made product.  I think even the new  VW products are over-priced.  But hey, I'm driving one that's 30  years old and still going.  I guess I would have thought IT was  overpriced in 1976. :)   
  Cheers...KR

This is a good country of origin tale:
