Subject: Re: [T2] vac dizzy help on 71 1600 dp...

&gt; I tried sucking on both ports, the arm doesn't move at all. Could it be
&gt; hooked up incorrectly or does this mean 100% that the vacuum is kaput?

disconnect the can from the plate. suck on it? does it move?
if not the can is shot.
if yes the advance plate is likely stuck.
