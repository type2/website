List
Anyone who was at Everybus this weekend was graced with the presence of list
member Jaime Walker's brother, Jonathan. He is in the hospital now,
diagnosed with viral emsephalytis and could possibly die from it. He is
going from bad to worse and in a lot of pain. His family and friends have
asked us to pray for him and keep him in your thoughts. We hope with some
support he can pull through this!!
Jaime's new friend,
Rob Henley
