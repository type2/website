&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; '71 westy 1600dp stock.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally back from Spain and have the bus up and
&gt; going after some
&gt; tweaking with my recent rebuild. The bus will start
&gt; the moment the key
&gt; is turned if it has been sitting for a couple of
&gt; days but after a
&gt; 25-35 minute drive if I turn it off the bus won't
&gt; start. The battery
&gt; acts dead. With jumper cables on it won't start
&gt; either. A good push
&gt; though and the bus will fire right up. It sits for a
&gt; few days and then
&gt; it starts again with the turn of the key. My
&gt; generator light never
&gt; comes on and this never happened before the rebuild.
&gt; After tinkering
&gt; and thinking I am leaning towards a bad cell in the
&gt; battery, maybe it
&gt; doesn't get charged fully when driving around. What
&gt; are some other
&gt; ideas or opinions?
&gt; 
Solenoid. If you want to test the theory, open it up,
clean it, spray with LPS1 (preferably) or WD40 (cuz
you have it) and reassemble. Problem gone? Get a new
solenoid and have it ready. Before you do, see how
many spade connectors yours has (doubles don't count -
the two - spade type have them in two distinct
locations) Both solenoids are available or you can
make a simple connector wire with a spade end from the
large terminal that goes out to the starter. This
provides power to the fuel pump while cranking.

If the clean and lube doesn't help then you have the
classic low-voltage-to-the-solenoid syndrome and a
quick look at archives will give you a hundred
&quot;solutions&quot; - mostly ways to avoid actually solving
the problem, but they do work for a while. -BaH
