Lukas --
My girlfriend had a similar problem with her 77 bus.  After a long drive to
Seattle and back, just as she rounded the corner for home, she began to get
some grinding/whirring noises from the middle to back of the bus.  Once she
got it home (fortunately she was close by) I went out to attempt a
diagnosis.  With the engine running and me working the clutch and shifter
(but not moving the bus), I found that there was much difficulty engaging
all gears; really had to push it in as the noises accompanied.  I then
found that when I would let out the clutch and try to move the bus, it
wouldn't move at all; the shifter felt like it was going into gear, but I
was obviously mistaken.  After a while of doing this, things went from bad
to worse in a hurry: the thing finally went into 1st and wouldn't come back
out again -- not even with both hands.  Dead in the water.  I looked in the
engine compartment and there appeared to be fluid or gear oil splattered
all over the inner walls.  Anyway, to make a long story short, she was the
&quot;proud&quot; owner of a &quot;new&quot; rebuilt transmission about a week later after a
respected mechanic's inspection.  Clutch and all else was fine.  Sorry to
be a downer, but your symptoms sounded similar to ours.  You may want to
get the tranny looked at.
