Subject: Re:stereo wiring

The wire coming from the ignition switch is a ground (or negative) wire.  The 
OTHER wire coming into the buzzer is the positive wire.  You cannot get 
&quot;juice&quot; from the wire coming from the ignition switch.

The wire coming from the ignition switch first goes through the door switch 
(which is a DPDT switch -- two switches in one -- 1 for the dome light &amp; 1 
for the warning buzzer).  You would need to take the wire (brown) from the 
ignition switch and wire it opposite a hot wire on the activating circuit of 
the relay.  Then on the other circuit of the relay (the one the relay 
activates), just tap into a wire that is always hot.  This would be the power 
wire to the stereo.  If you need a diagram I can scan one in and send it to 
you p-mail.  I'm not an ASCII artist.
