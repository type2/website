Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot List Member Discount

&gt;When I took the plunge and decided to turn my hobby into my livelihood, the
&gt;list was the first place I announced the opening of the Bus Depot.  I got
&gt;overwhelming support from the members of the list, without which the Bus
&gt;Depot might not exist today. The list member discount is my way of giving
&gt;something back to the list and thanking you for your support over the years.

When I began the process of raising my bus from the dead 3 1/2 years ago the very first part I ordered came from Bus Depot after finding Type2_dot_com.

It was fortunate timing because I didn't know what a Bentley was, where to find good quality parts or even what the part numbers were. I spent a good deal of time learning the various part numbers just by surfing the BD website.

I'm not sure where my bus would be if I hadn't discovered the list and subsequently BD.
