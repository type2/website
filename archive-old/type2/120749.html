&lt;&lt; I have a small 12'volt oscillator fan I can use to move the air 
around, but is there any better way to boost the heat output to the 
front of the bus?  The vents are plenty hot, just no wind comes out 
of them. &gt;&gt;

Parts Express has 12V computer fans...I got a pair from the
local computer repair/salvage shop, tho' for a couple of bucks.
Since I'm fairly tall (6'1&quot;) I needed the top of the windshield
clear in order to drive...Just sitting them atop the vents blows
enough air to clear the windshield...
