Did you CHECK to see that any of this was bad?;p  No? Ahhh..

Troubleshoot, and replace what you find to be wrong.  Dont throw parts at
it.  Time is cheap, parts arnt.

&gt; Well... I was about to give up. Two weeks later I figured &quot;what the hell...
&gt; I'll give it one last shot,&quot;..... It started right up. I sensed something
&gt; weird when I kept pushing on the gas but I figured it ws nothing.... I turned

wierd, as in?  did the engine rev normally? hesitate?  what?

&gt; turning over just ilke before... man this is frustrating... I apologize again
&gt; for posting this information again earlier, thanks everybody for your help.


First place I would look here would be to see if you have spark.  Have a
strobe timing light? No? Ok.

Hmm. shoot.  Well, i'll tell you the dirty method, as it IS the easiest.
If you have anymedical conditions where an electrical shock would be
harmful, DO NOT DO THIS. You do this AT YOUR OWN RISK.;p

Pull one of the plug wires off one of the plugs.  Stick your finger into
the hole.  Hold the palm of your hand to the engien tin, or block.  NOTE!
Do not let any other part of your body touch any part of the bus during
this time.  Doing so could allow the current to cross your heart, which is
a bad thing.  This way, it goes in your finger, out your palm.  

Get someone to attempt to start the engine.  If you yell, they can stop.
(warning! this may hurt. )

did you yell?  good.

plug that wire up, and go back to checking the FI.

You didnt feel anything?  Was your finger IN the hole? (shouldnt really
need to be....)  Still nothing?  You have something wrong with your
ignition system.  Tell us, and we will walk you through that too.


Ok.  you have a sore hand, and your hair is standing on end.  And your
prolly have a bump on your head from banging it into the engine bay
lid....


Find the fuel pump.  under the bus somewhere. In front of the engine, and
problably higher then the tranny.  I dont know exactly, never had to find
one on a late bay...;p

Put your hand on it.  Get your helper to turn the key on.  Does the pump
buzz?  No?  Well, try this:  make sure the bus wont move, first! you are
laying underneeth, remember???  Keep holding the pump, and have the helper
try to start the engine.

Still no buzz?  Ok.  You have a fuel delivery problem.  You are not
getting fuel to the injection.

Back to the engine compartment, and look for a relay block on the left
front (FIF!) if the engine bay.  it's a double relay....~3 inchs long, and
inch thick...and has a bunch of wires coming out of it.

Put your hand on it.  turn the key on.  Does it click? turn the starter
over...does it click more?

No?  Tell us.

Yes?  you possibly have a bad fuel pump.

There are much more specific ways of testing the components, but I am not
going to try to explain them.:)


My suggestion, if you are going to try and find this yourself, is to get a
Bentley manual for your bus.  Period.

else, get it towed to your mechanic, and spend your dough letting him fix
it.

Good luck...
