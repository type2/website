The one on my 71 Westy consists of a length of heavy angle iron to which the hitch is mounted.  The angle iron bolts underneath the frame rails at the back, in front of the bumper.  I could take some pix possibly in the next few days if needed.  It is plenty strong enough to tow a small trailer.  Sorry, my hitch is not for sale.

Subject: [T2] Early Bay Trailer Hitch

Hi folks,
   I'd like to be able to tow a small trailer with our 71 westy.  What does 
a trailer hitch for an early bay look like?  A verbal desciption would be 
great, a scetch even better, and a hitch to sell to me would be great.  I'm 
just looking to tow a small trailer to carry some bicycles.  Since the bikes 
are tandems a regular type of bike rack is out.
