Subject: Re: [T2] Sell the van?! 

If you need the money to finance college? Why not try selling the 
bus to a family member?. In this way, not only you have some 
cash for beer in college. You still are able to keep track of the bus 
and possibly when the financial situation is stable you can buy it 
back.
