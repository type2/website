the trick is to find some nylon rope, just thinner in diameter than the
thickness of the glass pane...put the rubber seal on the car first....then
lay the rope in the trough where the glass goes in....now you'll need a
buddy to help, but, duck tape a broom handle or something to the front of
the window for a handle, and lay the window over top the rubber seal, but
roughly in its place....keep the ends of the rope together in your hand...on
the outside of the glass....then starting at a corner.....push down on the
glass, while pulling the rope straight back to you....this will peel the
rubber lip from UNDER the glass, to OVER the glass edge with it sitting in
place...just make sure you go slow, so you don't tear the rubber....but
that's how its done...
