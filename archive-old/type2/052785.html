&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; Since I do a fair amount of highway driving, I was thinking about installing
&gt; a custom low/high ratio 4-speed transmission or a custom 5-speed
&gt; transmission in my Bus so I can pull decent highway speeds without winding
&gt; out the engine too much.
&gt;
&gt; Then I got to thinking (always dangerous)...
&gt;
&gt; If the Type 4 engine really is the same unit that was used in the Porsche
&gt; 914, then wouldn't the 914 5-speed transmission be a perfect fit?  I realize
&gt; that going to Porsche parts immediately doubles the price, but it might be
&gt; something worth researching.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any info.

It IS possible, but more work than you might be up for. The up side is that the
901 series is a lovely transmission that is easy to dissasemble and there are
3-4 ratios available for every gear (except 2nd which is fixed to the
mainshaft-then you need a 904 mainshaft- if you have to ask how much, you can't
afford it.) Also, I think 3 different r&amp;p ratios: 6/29, 7/31 (the normal one),
and at least one other which I can't remember.
The down side is nothing from the VW fits: the clutch is different (so change to
a 914 flywheel and clutch), the cv's are different, the mount is different and
the shifter is different. If you use a 914 trans, you'll have 5 speeds in
reverse and 1 forward (mid engine setup), and I'm not sure if there is room in
the case to flop the ring gear or whether you need a 911 case. The next problem
is that your bus engine horsepower and your needs created by the  aerodynamics
(and weight) of the bus mean that NONE of the ratios will be right.
Expect to spend about $3000 to do the job right!
And BTW, they are NOT the same engine. ALL 914's have higher compression ratios,
some have different cams, and the 2 liter 914 has heads that are quite a bit
different. This all boils down to less horsepower in the bus engines, but wider
power curves.
