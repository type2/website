Subject: Re: [T2] More on &quot;As the Bus Depot Turns&quot;

Hey, now my feelings are hurt.  Not! :-D

I do agree that this has gone on long enough, especially since Ron and I 
have settled our differences.

I think the he is a nice guy and his company should judged on the whole 
not based on one person's one time experience.  I apologize to all for 
this unfortunate thread we've had to follow.  It was my fault and I 
accept total responsibility.

Ron is welcome at our house on Maui anytime.  We've got extra room and 
would be honored to host him.

'79 Bus on Maui - no heater boxes either ;-)

&gt;I say we all just throw Bradley off of the list ( Just
&gt;kidding Bradley )
&gt;
&gt;But really... do you think Bradley and Ron will get
&gt;back together next season? I think that a Hawaii
&gt;reunion show would be great.
