Subject: re: Clutch cable drama

You need a clevis pin up at the clutch pedal.  The pin snapped
on our '72 Bus and I had to drive it home about 5 miles without
the clutch.  Once home, for a quick fix, I reattached the cable
with a 10mm bolt.  It worked for about 2-3 days and then the
cable snapped because the bolt did not allow the cable to 
slide around on the lever.  Fortunately I had bought a new cable
(plus a spare) by then so I fixed it right the second time.
