I thought all Bentley's had color wiring diagrams.  Well, from 68 to 72 are
color wiring diagrams.  73 to 79 has color somethings; I think they are flow
charts.  Not as easy to understand as the wiring diagrams, but they are in
color.
My personal copy is falling apart so I had each color wiring diagram
laminated at Kinko's.  I did this because I use it all the time and I wanted
it to last.  The copy I am selling also has the color wiring diagrams.
