Re 77 exhaust manifold copper gasket replacing-
If they are oval, you got the right ones -in 79, I believe they are
&quot;rectangular&quot;.  Now good luck with removing the manifold- To get more
thread grab if you have rusted original nut holding stud ends, you can
saw away part of the manifold (it's very thick, will never miss 1/8&quot;)- 
so the stud will stick down further. I had one stud start to unscrew
itself from the head, but got tighter due to corrosion likely chewing
the threads.  There's not a lot of room to play with the nuts (a torch
could damage the head), but I got the nut off and upon reassemby, the
stud would only screw up so far and then started &quot;pulling&quot;.
I didn't want to pull the engine to deal with redrilling for oversize
studs, so I used a u-clamp, a big washer, and a long piece of 3/8&quot; all
thread to pull up the manifold from below by running the top of the all
thread through a body frame hole you'll see up there.
