Subject: 71 Type II Bus

		 I just bought a 71 Bus and have created a list of things I
would like to do to it, but of course I'm a novice.  I've become a new
subscriber to this group and bought John Muir's book.  Anyone else have any
suggestions for me?  Other than good luck and I hope your mechanically
inclined!
