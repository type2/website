Subject: Compression 74 Bus

Repeated the compression test this weekend, dribbled the oil in the  
cylinder to check the rings. Bad news, compression jumped from 70 to 110  
(cylinders 1 and 3).  I used a long rubber hose to feed oil into the spark  
plug hole.  Worked fine.

I think I am headed down the rebuild path. At least new rings. I may be  
able to replace the rings without pulling the engine, not sure - any  
thoughts?.  (74 Type IV engine).

Thanks in advance.

David.
