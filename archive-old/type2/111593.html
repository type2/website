Subject: Valve adjustment time?

have a quick question. My 72 bus needs a valve
adjustment and the 
timing
&gt; corrected. My local VW guy quoted me $250 for a
tune-up and complete
&gt; check-up.

I do the valve adjustment and timing in an hour on a
slow day.  Whether
$250 is worth it depends upon what a &quot;complete
check-up&quot; entails.

George

George, you getting old or what?? Thirty minutes max
for the job!!  ;]
