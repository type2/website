Subject: castellated nut

I thought I read that the later busses had 36mm nuts on the rear hub like the bugs, but I guess that's not true as I borrowed the 36mm &quot;whack a nut&quot; device from my buddy and it was too small.

I'm restoring a 79' and I wanna start going thru the brake system. I know the hub's off without removing this nut. You only remove it to get to the bearings right? The whole of the brake system is accessible?

Billy
