Seems to me that I saw some of these on a bus at Way Out Salvage near
Huntsville, Arkansas. I could be mistaken about that, though. Their number
is 501-665-4126 in case you want to check. Derrick and Barbara Zimmerer.
They'll ship to you, but you'll have to send $ first. No credit cards
accepted. Good luck! Joe

&gt; Hey all,

&gt; Has anyone ever seen or heard of those bars that protect the rear windows from your luggage as you whip thru the &quot;S&quot; curves available for Vanagons?  A friend of mine referred to them as jail bars so I'm not sure of the correct term.  I know they were available on early transporters.
