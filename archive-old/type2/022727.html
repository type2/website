Missy asked:
&gt;&gt; On the same line of questioning...how much of the &quot;whitecoat&quot; POR-15 take
to do the poptop and luggage rack? &lt;&lt;

This seems like an expensive waste of materials to me.  POR15 is designed
for treating rusted metal, not your fiberglass pop-top parts.  I would go to
a marine dealer and buy some fiberglass boat cleaner/restorer and apply with
liberal amounts of elbow grease first.  If that does not bring them back to
their original shine, only then I would consider painting.
