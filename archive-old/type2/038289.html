Subject: Re: Your Battery tray replacement

I replaced my battery tray with a piece of PT plywood,[ after spraying 
rubberized undercoating all over the place], screwed into the ply from 
underneath with stainless self tapping screws to keep 'er in place.  It has 
lasted a number of years with no problems. I screwed another small piece of 
ply over the battery &quot;toe&quot; to act as a hold down. One in back, one in front. 
Not a permanent solution, but it'll do till I get her back into the shop for 
another body and paint session. Which may be sooner than I thought, as I find 
my doors are holding water, even tho the drain holes are open. My parking 
spot is on a slight slant to the passenger side-ergo, the holes end up a bit 
uphill. And rust never sleeps-even in a Florida drought.
