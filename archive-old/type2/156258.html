&gt;   hey tony is this why when you buy something at advance auto parts they always ask for your tele number? etc etc.....

Telephone numbers have become move valuable since the &quot;Do not call&quot; list
went into effect.  Once you conduct business with someone they are then
legally entitled to call you.  Otherwise they can't.  Having a &quot;business
relationship&quot; is a rather nebulous thing from the telemarketer's point of
view.  It could be argued that anyone with a &quot;strategic relationship&quot; with
the outfit that you did business with is entitled to call you.
