Subject: Quick AIRS Story

Hey volks,
dont know if my posts are makin it to the list or not
lately but heres a quick AIRS story.   on the way back
from NY to Nebraska last weekend we were cruisin down
I90 and came across a couple in a red Bug on the side
of the road.   I pulled over to offer a hand.   The
couple were going to Niagra Falls coming from NY city
and im surprised how far they actually made it.  
there vacuum advance hose was not attached to the
dizzy, the carb was leaking fuel from the base but
what actually killed them was i believe there coil was
caput.   it had juice goin in but none comin out.   So
seeing we could do nothin on the spot i gave them a
ride to the next rest area and broke out my trusty
AIRS list.   On my second call I got ahold of Dave
Rogge II and he gave me directions and the phone
number of a good air cooled shop in the area that i
was able to pass on.   With tow truck on the way i
headed out with a little extra VW karma in tow.   So i
know it wasnt for a bus, but hey they were air cooled
folk and it only took Dave a minute to find a phone
number and address.   so i say &quot;Thanks Dave!&quot;   by the
way the couple told me they had been trying to wave
people down for help on the highway and we of course
were the only ones who paid any attention.
