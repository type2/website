Subject: Cack-handed windscreen repairs.

Hi,

I'm in dire need.  I recently cut out the lower corners of my windscreen
frame because the steel was all rusted away.  I've (badly) welded in a
couple of repair panels.  On one side, to cover the gaps in my awful
welding (and rather than making matters worse by blowing more holes in
the steel) I put a couple of fibreglass patches along the weld seams. 
Well, I over applied, really, not having used fibreglass before.  And
now I'm left with a *lot* of fibreglass and resin.

I can't sand it down.  I tried tonight with a powersander and with 180
grit wet and dry and soapy water.  No joy.  The resin just clogs the
paper.

I've got a friend of a friend coming on Thursday night to re-fit the
screen (he does it for a job, apparently he can get the screen in
one-handed in fifteen minutes) and I need to get this lot flatted out
and painted before then.

My only option as I see it is to stick a sanding disc on an angle
grinder, brute force approach, grind/sand the resin off then resurface
with filler.  I can't think what else to do.

I *knew* I should have used fibre mat and filler in the first place.

Tips?  Advice?

Thanks in advance.
