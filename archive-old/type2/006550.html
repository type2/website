Alex,

    The side thrust on the rods have left that mark. As long as the
clearance is like that across the crank you should be ok there. It must hace
gotten low on oil at some point, as long as the bearing surface is not
blue/black your ok. Although I would have everything &quot;Miked&quot; to be sure.
Don't forget to have the big end of the rods checked too.
    A good set of calipers is something to have in your tool box, but for
this work you need a very good set of Mikes. Starrett is the way to go,
don't save money here, buy the very best you can get. In the mean time, the
machine shop shouldn't charge you to do the check.

See ya

Tommy
