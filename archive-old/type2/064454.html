Solvents are stange materials.  Something that dissolves in water 
might be fiercely resistant to paint thinner.  Gunk that laughs at mineral 
spirits may wash away with rubbing alcohol.  The moral of this is that 
if one solvent (mineral spirits) doesn't work, try something else.  

Acetone, mineral spirits (paint thinner to some), alcohol, electronics 
cleaner, soap and water, soaking in water, lacquer thinner, the green 
stuff, the purple stuff, waterless hand cleaner, are all weapons in 
the arsenal of cleaning agents at my command, plus others of course.

Usual disclaimer as to working with ANY solvent in a WELL ventialted 
area, proper attire, breathing apparatus, blah, blah . . .
