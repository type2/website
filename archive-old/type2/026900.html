Hi Everyone,

I recently aquired a '69 westfalia for a decent price because it had been 
sitting for a year and only driven once or twice in that amount of time.

It has: new engine (not rebuilt - new!) and new carb (34 pict-3)

Problem: doesn't idle and stalls most of the time

Symptoms (hmmm?): always starts immediately and idles high if cold - choke 
working fine,

if you let it sit for a few minutes starts immediately when warm and idles 
fine at regular low idle speed - for about 30 seconds! then dies, subsequent 
immediate starts have the smae problem - until you let it sit for a few 
minutes - then if idles fine

the only way to get it to idle and not stall is either revving the engine OR 
(INTERESTING PART HERE!) barely tap the accelerator OR back at the carb 
barely jiggle (a couple millimeters, just barely or more) on the throttle 
valve lever (you know, where the cable hooks into) - then it runs fine! if 
you stop the jiggling at any rmps below around 1750 rpm and hold it in one 
place then the engine dies in the same way at the low idle speed

Any ideas? Remember, it has a new carb but was sitting for a long time.

THANKS!
