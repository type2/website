Subject: Re: [T2] stock 77 Distributor no's?

Courtney asked:

 Hi, I have a Canadian 77 Westy, with a stock distributor. I can't get in there to really see what all the
no's are, but I do know I see the VW and Audi symbol on the side of it. According to OldVolksHome it should be
a VW 021-905-205P but that is for the U.S. 49, and doesn't mention Canada. I can't make out the no's cause I
had to use a mirror to even see this much. I KNOW it's the stock dizzy that came with the van and it's 2L F.I.
mechanical valve engine. It has a small vacuum can and a single vacuum line to it. I am assuming it's not a
Bosch, since I've never seen a Bosch dizzy marked with a VW symbol, but hey, I could be wrong. :-) and they
may have done that.
I have an XR700 ignition system installed and need to verify the no's so Crane cams can send me a new shutter
for the dizzy. They want the dizzy no's to be sure.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The 021 P should be the correct Bosch unit. And yes, it will also have a VW marks and a VW part number. The
021 is the VW number and the 0 231 168 005 is the Bosch number.
