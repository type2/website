&gt;Am I better served to stay with the stock system (crossover, u

Pluses and minues. I have the extractor system exhaust similar to this:

http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=352000

By similar, I meant I bought mine locally when I lived in Austin before I knew
about Bus Depot and it came with a Hecho En Mexico sticker.

It's well enough made but like with many aftermarket items fit and finish
vary:

- the painted burned off it pretty quickly but I know understand they are only
painted to prevent rusting during storage. After two failures I finally
managed to paint it with something that stuck on the third try: VHT black.

- the triangle flanges were flat but not aligned with the heater boxes. I had
to figure out a bolting up pattern otherwise I wouldn't be able to get all of
the bolts through the holes.

- the exhaust hanger for the engine block didn't reach the boss. I still have
to fix this problem.

- I had to bend the EGR takeoff so it would seal against the filter.

Aside from these issues which I don't have to deal with except when I remove
the exhaust, it's quiet, allow a Jamie River's hitch to be mounted and the
exhaust exits to the side although not exactly in the same place the original
exhaust did.

&gt;If the latter, where should I install the bung for the wideband gauge

For 75-78 exhaust, install it in after burner pipe on the header side of the
pipe (inside):

Buy a stainless steeel bung and use stainless rod to weld it into place (if
you have a pipe from Dansk use regular steel).

I installed mine on the #1/#2 side. I originally wanted to use the same side
as the CHT sender (#3) but when I was figuring out where I would run the
wiring it turned out more convenient on the side I chose. Figuring out a
mounting location for the bung isn't too hard. Mount it as vertical as
possible but make sure you clear the support for the pipe that connects the
heater box to the flapper box.

For drainage reason, the Bosch tech document on the LSU 4.2 sensor requires a
minimum mounting angle of 10: from horizontal but I think 20: from vertical is
the best mounting position for this bus becuase it allows the sensor wiring
which isn't flexible to go straight up:
