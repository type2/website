Subject: Curtain Set

Hi All,

I am currently looking to buy a complete curtain set (including all
hardware) for my 79 Bus.  Does anyone know where the best place to buy this
is?  I have checked many places online, but I want to make sure I get a set
that is good quality, without getting ripped off.

Thanks.
