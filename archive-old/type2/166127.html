Subject: tranny parts-where available?

My mechanic in north NJ asked me to ask the list re finding tranny 
parts- he said core trades for rebuilt ones are $7-800 now, but my 
248,000 mi orginal tranny was so good -oil was remarkably clean-said all 
my shifting noise was mostly nosecone or shift linkage (I never lugged 
it, changed oil at 25-30 k intervals), it only needed some seals, 
reverse gear, not sure of anything else- said BusDepot does not sell 
this stuff.  Anyway, he has a tranny expert doing it in North Jersey, 
but apparently souces have dried up since these are in such demand for 
uses OTHER than busses--can anyone help out here?
