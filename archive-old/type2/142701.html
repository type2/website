&gt; I went through a similar deal with someone who had a product for  sale and
&gt; he
&gt; was in Oregon and I am in Virginia. I was told that it was shipped 2  days
&gt; after the money was recieved. I had to go back and find where I got his 
&gt; info
&gt; and hassle a friend of his who let him use his phone number to sell the 
&gt; product. The friend swore he would pay and after 3 months I got the 
&gt; product.
