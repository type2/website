&gt; You're talking about J-Tubes, here, I think.  I've seen them for Type I engines, but not for Type IV. They probably exist somewhere, though.

I've got a set on my 78, but I found em when cleaning out a garage, not

up an old heater box to get down to the basic pipe that runs through the
heater box
