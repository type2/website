This problem I have just  encountered on my H20 VW brakes.
Drove me crazy, for a week. The only way to acheive  a firm pedal was to 
use a one man bleeding system with a vacuum pump. I found that pumping
28&quot; of vacuum and waiting until all the tiny bubbles dissappeared, closed
the bleeder and went to the next wheel. Start at the furthest wheel from the
 
master cylinder and work toward the closest wheel. This solved the problem.
Hope this helps
