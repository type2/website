Subject: Clocks in Buses

Not to degrade this thread, but I must say I'm impressed:

People who drive buses who are concerned about what time it is!

I have to admit, I've considered putting a visible-while-driving clock in 
my bus, but I gave up on the idea after I decided it would just make me 
aware that I had to &quot;be somewhere&quot; and tempt me to drive faster.

The last time I can remember pushing my bus slightly faster than I thought 
safe, I pulled a 180 on a 50 meter stretch of ice coming down Willamette 
Pass in Oregon.  I think I was going 45 mph and my bus has a nicely 
crushed rear-corner panel as a result (I'm lucky that was it!)

cheers,
