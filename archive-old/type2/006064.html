Hi all
I have this 74 Dorper camper conversion here,, and I have to get rid of the
thing.... way past saving the main body shell, but i have saved al the parts
off it,,,
I have the camper interior still that is tooo big to keep,,, and I would
love to get it to someone who could use it!
Free,
It is a pull out bed / rear seat, and cushion,  with a table and a sink
cabinet, and a wardrobe cabinet, there is the panelling, and a pop top that
resembles a 66 Westy top.
I think that it would go into a Bus and make it a Camper real easy,,  fwiw.
It is in fair shape,, no real defects,,
Come pick it up! I'll help you load it!  :-)
