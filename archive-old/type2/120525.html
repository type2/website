WOW! that is cheap for a new engine. are you sure this is a new one?
Mine was ~ $1600ish IIRC. But i love this engine. I've got it in my
66. I had all the tin for a dp engine so I can't help a lot w/ the
other questions, but I can say if the engine is a new VW longblock
it's certainly a good way to go.
