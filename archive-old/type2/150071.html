Subject: Re: [T2] How many solenoids..

Hi Barry,

I do remember that *SO* well..... One of the many things on the list  
of items that helped swing me over to L-Jetronic...

Those spade connecters on the solenoids are angled to drop LIVE 12V  
wires off the clips onto the engine.  Not a very smart design.



Happy trails,

&gt; Sure enough, the idle solenoid had flipped off its wire, and the  
&gt; idle solenoid had actually unscrewed itself somewhat.  I tightened  
&gt; the idle solenoid and put the wire back on.
&gt;
&gt; No even 1 mile later the wire had popped off the idle solenoid  
&gt; again.  This time I used a pair of pliers to firm up the two female  
&gt; connectors on that 3&quot; piece of wire.  All is well again.
