&gt; This unfortunately defeats the purpose of the extra cooling by adding
extra
&gt; load to the engine, which =  added BTU.  An electric pump is the only way
I
&gt; can think of to bypass this problem.  If you were to use a full-sized
&gt; mechanical pump, Moroso makes an electrically driven one for drag-racing
&gt; V-8's.
&gt;
&gt;
Drag racers use electric water pumps to cut down load on their engine.
This is fine for the 1/4 mile, since the pumps are being powered by the
battery and not the alternator.

For us normal folks out on that road trip to the grocery store, the electric
water pump
will get it's power from the alternator thus putting a load on the engine.

1 HP = 746 Watts
HP load of pump  = (12V * (current consumption of pump))/746

That should get you close, but is it really enough to worry about?
10 amp pump is only about 0.16 HP of load (not counting friction losses)
