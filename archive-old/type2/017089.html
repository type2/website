Subject: illustrated parts catalogs

Repeatately the question has come up on where to get the illustrated
parts catalogs that VW is selling in Germany.
These catalogs have only the pictures from the fiches, but some people
consider them helpful.

They are also sold by the aftermarket dealers in Germany.

One of them is &quot;Ehring &amp; Schuetzenhofer&quot;, to be reached by fax (from US)
under   (01149) 261 16657
or phone (01149) 2603 14154

They charge about $5 per catalog + shipping.
Catalogs are (or were) available for every VW. Right now only the bug
catalog is not available.
