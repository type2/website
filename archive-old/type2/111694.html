Subject: Driver side sliding door??

Does anyone know if there is such thing as a driver's side sliding door?  I was just wondering, cause there seems to be an upper sliding track built into mine on the drivers side, where it is on the other side.  Was there like an option to have 2 sliding doors or one on the opposite side, and if there was, where would I be able to obtain one?
