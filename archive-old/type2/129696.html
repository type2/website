Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

If the wheels you had powder coated were prepped right, they should be
showing no signs of rust--

Probably right. I won't argue... 

For all the hoopla regarding the advantages this refinishing system, 2
years, and &quot;just showing signs of rust&quot; is no bargain--

Well with my local shop it was cheap and easy and thus my choice at the time. In the future I might go towards some sort of &quot;real&quot; paint. 

The trick without a doubt is the locking down and sealing of the
metal--and this is where most folks cheat--in the prep prior to
refinishing any portion of their vehicle--

I had them sandblasted and the powder shop baked them very good (I was told) but on close examination I can see where the powder did not get into the rack very well. Where it did, it sort of looks like it cracked a bit. Don't know if it was the error of the shop, failure of the powder, lack of enough powder or what. Hard ot do good QC for myself here as I'm no expert. 

Are you saying I needed to do alot of the prep you mentioned before the powder? I thought, and I could be wrong, that the powder needed to go over bare, clean metal. 

Also last night I saw a message regarding a warning about wheels blowing
off at speed due to paint or powder coating preventing the lug nuts from
tightening down.

That caused some initial worry for me, but I'll be watching my lug torques for a while when I get moving (hopefully soon) around town. I don't expect any problems honestly. 

Interesting thread all the same! Thanks ALL!
