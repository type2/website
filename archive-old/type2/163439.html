Subject: Re: [T2] Need ac outlet block for 78 Westfalia

Installing a circuit breaker (15 amp is fine) along with a GFI outlet is an
excellent choice.

Originally in that 4.5 x 7.5 opening you describe is where a double outlet
with a circuit breaker was mounted on a metal panel that screwed into the
wood paneling.  These were made in USA by Delta Six Industries in
Chatsworth, CA a very, very long time ago.  These are pretty difficult to
find as few Westy's get parted out like your friend's apparently has been.

The outside 110VAC connector for the 74-79 Westy looked just like it's 80-91
Vanagon plastic counterpart except the casing was pot-metal with a bakelite
inside housing and was also manufactured by Delta Six as well.  These are
also hard to find, but I happen to have two of 'em (used) in case anyone's
interested.  Asking price is $35 including postage.

&gt;        I have a 1978 Westfalia camper bus. It has a stove. It used
&gt; to have a refrigerator. The previous owner removed many of the
&gt; electrical components including removing the wires from the outside
&gt; ac plug, most refrigeration components, and any ac outlets that may
&gt; have been present.
&gt;        My friend tells me I need an AC only outlet block (none of my
&gt; dc outlets presently work). However, I would accept an AC/DC outlet
&gt; block as well.
&gt;        I think an alternative would be for me to install a circuit
&gt; breaker and a GFI outlet. Anyone suggest I do that instead?
&gt;        There is a 4.5 by 7.5 hole in the wood paneling under the
&gt; rear seat that I think is designed to hold this outlet block. The
&gt; hole is between the access door and the driver's side of the bus.
&gt;        If you have any working parts that I could use to reinstate
&gt; an ac connection, please net me know what you have, its size,
&gt; condition and price. (I intend to put in the reserve battery, relay
&gt; kit, and dc outlet from the relay kit later).
