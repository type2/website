Subject: Re: Ahhh... finally - progress!

Thanks! LOTS of information in that one. Don't know why I didn't think of 
looking in the library. I will be sure to insulate the inside - some 
insulation in there already (did Westies have insualtion or am I looking at a 
PO that wasn't that bad?) -and- install a vapor barrier. Time to go to the 
friendly local home improvement place!

Thanks,
