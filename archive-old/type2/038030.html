&gt; My new (to me at least) 78 Westy is sitting out front like a log. Won't

&gt; 
&gt; 1) The PO clipped the 3 wires for the Cold Start Valve due to a crumbling
&gt; connector. I wish he would have left it's remains on, but could this cause
&gt; the engine not to start? How do I determine which wires should go where on
&gt; the new connector? My donor 78 has a crumbling connector here as well...

no cold start valve, very hard to impossible to start.  (try a little,
emphasis little, bit of starting fluid into the air cleaner and see if it
starts and runs, if it is &quot;_just_&quot; the cold start valve it will probably
start and continue running, if it does not start at all, got lots of
places to look, if it starts and runs for a few seconds and stalls it is
probably in the fuel system. maybe fuel pump, maybe injectors, check the
FI trouble shooting flow chart that I think is up on the library

&gt; 2) There were two extra wires coming from the pos. lead on the battery. One
&gt; is not connected at all (no trace of it anywhere), but the other was crimped
&gt; to a blue wire that goes into a loom over to the aux. battery. Does anyone
&gt; know what this one's for? I do not have it on my other 78.

hmmmmm, lots of options, the blue wire could be to the aux battery
disconect that keeps you from draining the main battery with aux &quot;Stuff&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 3) There are two T1 connectors that aren't connected to anything right now.
&gt; They come out of the loom on the right side of the engine. What are these
&gt; for? My thought was they were for a CA engine as they are not on my donor.

there is one that comes from the loom on the right side that connects to
the starter via a quick disconect, also one that goes to the voltage
regulator that is on the firewall. also another wire to fuel presure
regulator,  maybe anyone of these or something else???

&gt; 4) Is there a source for new FI and engine wiring harnesses? It seems that

not that I am aware of, although the connectors are avaliable from a
couple of sources on this list, I believe Bus Boys and possibly Bus Depot
have em.

&gt; the PO had a fun time w/ it over the years and I really don't want to solder
&gt; all of 'em back together again.

you probably will have to do some cut and paste to the electrical system
from the sounds of things, the Fuel injection system is reliable and
efficient BUT it does require all of the wires hooked up in the right
places (also the .009 distributor does not work well on the FI engine)
  THe Bentley Manual has the wiring harness for the Fuel injection system
completely shown, I took and made an enlarged copy and put it on the back
of a board so that I could more easily follow the wiring traces.

Good luck
Bob
