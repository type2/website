You  found a squirrel cage fan that can handle high temps and runs on 
&gt;  12v?  Please let me know the brand because I was looking for one and  
&gt; couldn't find anything.  If my current idea doesn't work, I'll  go for 
&gt; the inline squirrel setup. 



I bought a kit from NAPA a long time ago. I think I still have it. It's  
yours for the price of shipping if you want it.
