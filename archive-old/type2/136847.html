&gt;&gt; A quick search on ebay revealed these bus emblems:
&gt;
&gt; I just checked this out, some of these are selling for as little as 
&gt; $15.00
&gt; for OE stuff.  And there appear to be casters making the repros in 
&gt; metal.
&gt; Not sure if there's a good repro market for them in resin.

What year are we talking about again?  73-79 emblem sells for $43 at 
Bus Boys.  I ordered one earlier this year.  It's chromed plastic, but 
Genuine VW (according to the part bag it came in, anyway).
