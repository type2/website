&gt;What's up everybody, I was wondering if anybody knows if it is possible to re-torque my heads while the motor is in my 68 Westy.I'm about to adjust my valves again and I wanted to torque my heads.
&gt;Thanks,

&gt;wingnutt sends his two cents;       yes, u can if u really like to swear alot.  i'd pull it and do as a previous person has said, &quot;fix nasty leakys (bad oil seals), retorque case connecting bolts proper like (don't overtorque), insert helicoils on stripped threads, and clean off any possible future road waste (vw markings tool for prefered vw parking spots. spots get it?)   mine 1300 in a 68' bus is fit as a fiddle now except for that annoying main bearing leak caused by the p.o. strange need to torque down the valve clearance till there wuz none and overrevving the poor bug motor giving the bearing seat a wide berth. this equals 1 quart per long haul (100 mls &amp; up) at highest speeds (60 mph) and i can also easily find the exact spots that i parked just the other day. but gosh dern it, them heads are on real good.   dids i mention   bad seals  arf.  arf.  CALIFORNIA JOKE,  van too.    HOW'D I GET MY 68' YOU ASK?  ENGINE FIRE CASUALTY.    REPLACE UR FUEL LINES WHILE U GOT THE !
EC HATCH OPEN.    busted fuel lines can really blow your day to hell.     wingnutt and the ugly bus.
