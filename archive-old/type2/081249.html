Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning West roof (further to...)

Folks, for what it's worth:

I recently bought a gorgeous Volvo 765 with nary a problem but a sagging
headliner.  I took it to a local
Headliners Plus! guy, and was consequently so impressed with his work and
rates, I went home, drove
my 78 Westy back to him, and asked what he could do about that godforsaken
mildew stain on the
&quot;fuzzy&quot; crap that lines the inside of the poptop. (I had, by that point,
spent egregious amounts of money
on surely every commercially-available product... and nearly killed myself
in the process a number of times:
fumes tend to congregate up there!)

Well, he takes a gander, and in the end, for a mere $250, he installed a
&quot;marine-grade&quot; headliner, a nice
comfy kinda stuff, PADDED mind you, and (here's the kicker) applied 3/4&quot; oak
strips all the way around
the inside of the poptop - to which he re-stapled the canvas (which was
sagging on one side) and screwed
them into the fiberglass.

It looks incredible - and is surely the one-thing-I-didn't-do-myself of
which I am the proudest! I highly
encourage other folks to investigate similar options, if $250 is reasonable
for them.

Cheers!
