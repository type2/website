&gt; &gt; What's the price tag on those &quot;Woosung SV 820&quot;'s?

&gt; these are an excellent tire, and great value. no good in a real
&gt; winter application however, they are a summer tire.
&gt;
&gt; by the way, this tire is sold in a few brands, woosung, signet, maybe
&gt; more. all the same tire.

Other brands for these are Hercules, Merit and Jupiter, IIRC.

Unless they have changed, they don't have a M+S rating (even though the
passenger-rated tire of the same style does!), so even
California-style snow use is verboten.
