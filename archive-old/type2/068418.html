Subject: Re: Aux. batt. install

&gt;Mike,
&gt;        I'm not sure the best way to respond to a response on the list so
&gt;I'm just writing you (any enlightenment might help).  No, I don't have a
&gt;healthy stereo to run the battery down, just the stock AM deal.  I have a
&gt;couple of aux. fans, a 12 to 110 converter, and some lights that I like to
&gt;run at night that tend to run the battery down, or at least make me worry
&gt;that I won't be able to start in the morning.  I also have a trolling motor
&gt;for fishing that uses a deep cell battery that I'd like to be able to
&gt;charge as I ramble down the road.
&gt;        Can I install some sort of relay switch so I can switch the batts.
&gt;from up front.  I did see some kind of unit in J.C. Whitney that
&gt;automatically isolated batteries but I'm not sure if that will work because
&gt;I don't have separate wiring for these au. electrics.
&gt;
&gt;P.S. If you wnat to post this that would be fine.
&gt;
&gt;THanks,

  Eric, I'll take a shot at this but I think a post to the list is
in order too. There is experience out there that may have a better
approach.

 Not having seperate wiring: meaning you're tied in where-ever on the 
normal circuit.

 OK let's put a deep cell battery in that system.
It runs the normal stuff and your auxilliaries. 

 You still have to size it to meet all your requirements for power.

 Now the extra battery is a Standard battery for cranking the starter
only and you would re-route the heavy lead from battery to starter
over to it.

 Put in the standard isolation switch, manual or electric that opens
when the key is off.

 It is set up to drop the cranking battery out of the circuit while 
leaving the deep draw in.

 When you start up the isolator ties them together for charging while
you run.

 If you use a manual switch up front, it would have to go to a relay
of substantial size like another starter relay and heavy leads
between the batteries. Your manual switch in front would just be a 
light line to activate the normally open starter relay.

 Now I post this to the list and let them pick it apart.
It beats smoking a new circuit.

 Well ladies, what you think?
