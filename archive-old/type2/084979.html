Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Heat, rust, noise in VW's&quot;


&gt;The exhaust wrap question has been batted around more than just a few times.
&gt;Those on the pro side seem to feel that wrapping both eliminates heat and
&gt;helps to increase power by keeping the exhaust hot.  On the other side of the
&gt;question folks believe that the wrap makes the exhaust tubing too hot (early
&gt;failure) and promotes rust and rot.  Your choice, I would guess,  would
&gt;depend on which side of the question you find yourself.

Why not just create heat shields from steel that simply keeps the cold air 
off of the pipes in the winter?

Come summer, 20 minutes of hardware removal and you're back to cool exhaust...
