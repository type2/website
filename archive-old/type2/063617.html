If your brake fluid is low the brake lights won't work due to 
diffrences in pressure from fluid to air not activating pressure 
switch, check that too.
Don't know affect on brake dash light, but worth checking.

&gt;&gt;While driving the freeway to work this morning, the brake
&gt;&gt;warning light came on ('71 bus), I tried the brake and all
&gt;&gt;seemed to be fine.  When stopping, the light would go out,
&gt;&gt;then would come back on again after driving a moment.
&gt;&gt;Got to work ok, opened up Muir's book to find nothing
&gt;&gt;regarding this problem (he mentions the warning light
&gt;&gt;coming on while braking), any ideas?

&gt;I think the light is supposed to come on if one &quot;side&quot; of the master
&gt;cylinder (front brakes or rear brakes) has pressure and the other doesn't.
&gt;This would indicate that there's a leak in the low pressure side.
