Subject: so i do have a riviera, what now???

well i looked on the plates on the 75 mystery camper and sure enough there
it was anice clean vancouver washington address printed right on the plate
between the passengers and sliding doors.  unfrotunately some of the
original interior was rotted out when i bought it so that has been removed.
are these buses more rare or vaulable(i doubt it) i checked out the
wetwesties page and it was helpful. also on that page there were very few
pics and all seemed to be early bays with the lower turn signals below the
headlights and they were all blue,is this a trend or is it just me?? my bus
is orange and a 75. if anyone else has any more info please let me know i
would be very interested in hearing about these conversions. thank you.
