Subject: Re: [T2] Recommendations on KYB

IMHO, Gas A Justs are 'way too stiff for normal street use.  I've bought
KYB GR2s for three different cars so far, and I'm satisfied.  Slightly
stiffer than stock, w/ Japanese quality, and a modern low pressure gas
design.

Beetle GR2s are less than $20, Bus slightly higher.

.&gt;Yes, me again.
&gt;
&gt;I installed REAR KYB gas adjust on the FRONT.  Guilty.  I should have
&gt;checked the stock numbers.
&gt;
&gt;This set up is tearing up the '78 Westy.
&gt;
&gt;I will pull the front shocks off a '72, as an emergency R&amp;R.
&gt;
&gt;Are these KYB gas adjust shocks any good??  I am super afraid to dump
&gt;another $60 into real front shocks if what I am hearing and feeling is what
&gt;I can expect with more KYB.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, well, time to move cars and jack up cars and R&amp;R and R&amp;R and . ..
