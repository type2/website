Subject: GWB is down - At a loss...

I don't know where to go from here.

A couple weeks ago the GWB died. Symptoms are: will start and idle for a
while, but has no power to move the bus. It revs well, no backfiring or
popping.

Things done and made no improvement:
- Fuel pump swapped with a rotary
- Checked spark (nice fat blue one)
- Coil swapped
- Spark plugs swapped
- Checked for fuel delivery to carbs and fuel squirting from accel pump
- Compression (all between 100 and 110, except #2 which was at 80. All done
cold.)
- Spark plug wires shuffled around
- Distributor removed and replaced with my 009 loaded with points
- Removed the HyFire from the circuit
- Rotor swapped
- Cap inspected
- Fuel filter good
- Tank drained 3 gallons at full speed before I stopped because my can was
full.
- Replaced all the engine compartment wiring
- Checked carb and solenoid sealing
- Checked for vacuum leaks and leaks at the central idle circuit pipes
- Triple checked timing (009 and my stock dist have #1 at different
locations, so had to make sure.)

This is now critical since the apartments are threatening to tow the thing.
I was able to move it around the parking lot, but not much more.

Obviously it has to be either fuel or spark but for the life of me I can't
figure out where to go from here.
