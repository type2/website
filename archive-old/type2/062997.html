Subject: Re: Online Bus Raffle--Legal Issues; Take Note...

&gt; I have no idea what the legal status of this might be. Where I am, this is
&gt; not legal. Where the list &quot;is&quot;, legally, I have no idea. Where Joe C. is,
&gt; or what the statutes might be there, I have no idea either.

Guys,

  Be careful, be very careful.  In MN (where this list sits) this type of deal 
is NOT legal.  It is considered a &quot;game of chance&quot; and unless you are a 
non-profit or a Native American running a casino it does not work.  Also there 
are a bit too many ways this whole thing could blow up in our faces.  My 
suggestion is to try and sell the bus straight up and you should get your price.
It sounds to me like a good buy for someone that wants a solid bus.
