&gt;When I think of Deadheads, I think of people who are Grateful Dead fans, 
&gt;and I am surprised other people don't.  I will put my Deadhead stickers 
&gt;on my bus when the bodywork is done.  This has nothing to do with the 
&gt;condition of my bus and everything to do with my musical preferences.  
&gt;They will go nicely with my environmental stickers.

Absolutely, Amy.

Deadhead stickers bring to mind the Grateful Dead.  Any 'Dead'
concert would bring many, many bugs and busses.  And some very
colorful music lovers !! And good times....and great h*sh ! and...
I better stop before I get busted... :o)
