Subject: e-mail problem yesterday
Date: Mon, 1 Feb 1999 10:45:40 -0500
Message-ID: &lt;000101be4df9$eb388d60$35488dd1_at_the-bus-depot&gt;
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;
Importance: Normal

My local ISP had e-mail server problems since about 2 pm yesterday.  Any
e-mail sent to my PERSONAL e-mail address, ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com , since
yesterday afternoon will probably bounce.  Note: E-MAIL SENT TO
SALES_at_BUSDEPOT.COM WAS **NOT** AFFECTED.  That address reaches Jerry De
Baun, who uses a different ISP, so that e-mail did and will go through.
(However it is possible that he may respond slightly slower than usual since
he will be handling some of my e-mail volume as well as his own for the
moment.)

My ISP says they expect to have the problem resolved by the afternoon.
Meanwhile, if your e-mail to me bounced, you can try resending it later
today, redirect it to Jerry at sales_at_busdepot_dot_com , or phone the shop at
(215) 234-VWVW.
