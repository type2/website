Hi all,

Trish tried to back our 72 westy out of the garage this morning and couldn't budge
her.  It felt like the emergency brake wasn't releasing, but from the outside, it
looked like the back right wheel was the problem--like everything would go if it was
released!!

Any ideas on first steps in dealing with this would be greatly appreciated.

Dale G
