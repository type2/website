Hi All,
So I'm making curtains for the '72 Westy, but I can't figure out the =
sliding door curtain.
What was the original setup?  Where was the curtain rod and how/where =
was it attached?
And...
Does anyone out there have some good pics of their sliding door =
curtains?  I'm not a purist,
so they don't have to be original VW design, I just want to get an idea =
of what others are doing.

Thanks,
-PM
