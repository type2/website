Subject: Lack of Cooling Flaps
Message-ID: &lt;3757ee6cLack of Cooling Flaps*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

   &gt;      Not me!  Gauges are pretty much mandatory on my vehicles. And, while
&gt;the flaps are still in my T4 engine, there is no thermostat, and I always 
tore
&gt;the flaps out of T1's.

Hmm that's weird. I would never consider putting guages in my volkswagen. 
I think it's an aftermarket snow job.

&gt; I never drive off before my Cyl.Head Temp gauge reads
&gt;100 anyway, and the slight extra warmup time is irrelevant. Of course, since 
I
&gt;don't have an engine seal either, my engine probably warms up faster than 
most
&gt;sitting at idle.   8-)
  
Driving without an engine seal is like drinking whiskey and going to bed 
without brushing your teeth.


&gt;       If you love your bus -- get at least a oil tem and oil pressure gauge.

If you love your bus, keep your engine well-maintained, and you'll never need 
to know your oil temp.!!!!
