Subject: RE: [T2] Oil temp sender/sump plate

Paul Kagel writes:

&gt; so at the sump what is considered &quot;too hot&quot;  i don't figure it matters
&gt; what the thing reads as long as i know when it is too hot by the gage i 
&gt; am going to install.

and Sharpe, Steven responds:

&gt; Can anybody out there share their sump plate temp ranges?

In my limited testing of three senders on the same VDO gauge and 
nominally similar conditions, i found the temp dipstick to read the 
highest temperature.

the pressure relief valve sender read ~5 degrees lower than the dipstick.
the sump plate sender read ~15 degrees lower than the dipstick.

If one assumes that:
	-the temp dipstick is reading the &quot;real&quot; oil temp (???) 
	-the sump on the t-iv gets the same cooling as on a t-1 engine
	- 240-250 is an acceptable temp for a t-iv engine (???)

225-235 is probably the max you want to be reading off your sump sender.

That's a lot of assumptions though.
