Subject: Re: Engine (Paint)Assembly Procedures

It's Mick,
Many thanks for the reply Bill. We are getting in tune now! I perhaps did
not make myself clear first time but I haven't been  on the list long and
have been suitably corrected and am getting some replies.
Being 'new' I ponder whether some replies to this 'thread' are humorous or
revelling in the realms of  High School Physics and Practical assessment.
The original request(following at least 2 from other members) was to spruce
up the engine bay, Tinware etc, to effect visual improvement. I doubt I'd
notice any effect in the 'grunt' required to propel my bus down the road by
changing the engine paint.
Thanks again Bill.
Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Millennium Year 2000
