First I would like to thank those of you whe responded to my questions
reguarding my fuel injector problems.  I have my 1800 motor back in my 75 bus
and have started it but it dosent run smooth.  When I removed the motor, I
identified all of the elect. and vac. lines as I removed them as the books
say, the problem is when I cleaned the engine compartment some the writing
came of the labels I put on the hoses.  I need to know whare I can find
infromation on whare they all go!!  Please help....
