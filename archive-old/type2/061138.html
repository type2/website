Subject: Perennial sunroof/poptop question

Hey, type2 sisters and brothers,

If I were to cut a sunroof from a donor, along with all the reinforcement
steel, do you all think I could poprivet it into a hole cut in my bus and
have, say 70-80% of the strength of a welded or original sunroof? I want
to put an early bay, front-hinged poptop over it, without a bed or cot, so
the aesthetics are not an issue -- it will be covered up. Rivets at 2&quot; 
intervals. Goopy sealant between about a 1&quot; overlap. Roof currently 
covered with surface rust but will be treated with POR15.
