&gt; &gt; &gt; the CVs have dirt in them you need to disassemble them and clean with

&gt; &gt; I wouldn't suggest using soap and water on anything prone to

&gt; The way that it was explained to me is that soap and water clean the dirt
&gt; out without leaching out the grease closely associated with the metal,
&gt; what you might call &quot;in the pores&quot;.

Depends on the soap. Ever seen the comeercials for Dawn dish soap? They
don't lie. Floats the grease out of any little crack or hole. Simple Green
degreases rapidly too. 

You're going to regrease them correctly when you re-install them so having
the grease exit the pores is OK. Besides, cleaning in HOT water opens the
pores up so more grease can float out. Cold cleaning with brake cleaner
doesn't do this. Just removes grease from the surface -- it evaporates to
quickly to penetrate far.
