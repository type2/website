Subject: Re: [T2] diff. in 6 pin Air Flow Meters- what year is this?

I don't drive a FI bus, so bear with me please...  I know the H2O CIS cars 
had plastic plugs set into the intake boot to prevent damage to the flapper 
in case of a backfire.  Do the Type 2's have such a thing, and if not- could 
one create one to protect the AFM?

	Eron

After a fatal backfire in the 75 bus (FI- bent the AFM flapper and even
cracked the edge of the square casting) I checked my spare 6 pin AFM's-
the one I used has the same 012 part number ending, and has a bolt
sticking  out the center of the meter flapper. It has 2 lines to the
airbox, related to the charcoal canister and the breather box.  I have
another 6 pin AFM which has an extra small tube connected to it, and the
flapper has no bolt in the center.  It has the same part number, but the
last digits are 006- what year is this from and should it work in the
75?????
