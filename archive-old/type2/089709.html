Subject: Re: [T2] A new micro?  Don't think so!

While I do agree that the new Micro Bus isn't an exact duplicate of the
Bus of yore, but one day all these vehicles we are driving will be all
gone, or so overpriced to purchase, and maintain that no one will be
able to afford them anymore.

This new Micro concept is the closest thing that VW has to offer--and I
think it is pretty neat.

all it needs is round headlamps---

Much nicer than the ugly Eurovan.

Seen any Mini Cooper's Lately?

I drove one, and it is the closest thing since the original, only
better.

I want an S bad---

And according to Paul Harvey, the Mini has escalated BMW's sales 38%---

Must be something good about the new look alike stuff---:&gt;)

I'd wait until I actually saw and drove one  for real, prior to casting
any dispersions.

Later,

Terry

What is this? A microbus? I don't think so. What exactly constitutes
this being called a microbus, I mean, other than the marketing. Early
micros were very much like a true bus of that era. Engine in back, flat
nose, windows on top for scenic cruising. This one is front engine,
bulbous nose, and I do not see the top windows. Uuuuuuuugggggly!!!!! So
is it the 2 tone paint? Once again VW is drawing on the old which was
once considered a fridge on wheels, and is now a &quot;head turner&quot;, and
using it to sell it's product. 
Now I am sure we will see these things at shows with our busses, and
when we ask the owner about them, I think we will be seeing some
undersides of noses. Air is not water, and water, not air. Excluding of
course all the wasserboxer Vanagons, though in my opinion, that is a
van, not a bus. So is this new thing. Let's face it, it's a mini-van!
