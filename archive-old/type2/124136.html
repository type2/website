Subject: RE: [T2] one more TDC question

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess I got a bit confused about the post that stated you have a
50-50 chance of putting your distributor in wrong. &lt;&lt;&lt;

Yeah, that was mine. I have a confusing way of writing. I know. The only
reason I claim to be fluent in english is becouse it's the only language
I know. :) 

But if your timing mark is working for you, then it MUST be in their
right eh?
