Hi all;
   According to this morning's San Antonio Express-News Mexican President
Zedillo has &quot;indefinitely suspended&quot; the program because of the huge
unfavorable backlash that greeted it.

&gt; Waited for friday and now I've lost the news article, but....
&gt;
&gt; Since listmembers often go to mexico, especially in winter (based on
&gt; trip reports) I wanted to pass on some info that I read in the paper.
&gt;
&gt; In an effort to cut down on illegal car smuggling into mexico, the
&gt; mexican authorities are requiring a deposit for vehicles when entering
&gt; the country.  Something like - $800 for a '99-2000 vehicle, $600 for an
&gt; 84-99, and $400 for a &lt;84 model  &lt;snip&gt;
