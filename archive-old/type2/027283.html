&gt;Date: Wed, 3 Jan 2001 16:59:28 -0500 (EST)
&gt;
&gt;i'm looking for some NON!!! dansk barrel nuts for the heater flappers on
&gt;my 78. i am 2 for 2 with defective dansk ones, both different defects, or
&gt;more precisely one with one defect and the other with the same defect and
&gt;another, all my local hardware stores couldn't help me, and i have no
&gt;interest in dansk ones. Any leads are appreciated.  also on a side note i
&gt;discovered that laundry detergent and hot water make a great degreaser.
&gt;thanks in advance
&gt;jamie

&gt;Hi Jamie!
Here's a thought. I used to be a machinist and once had a similar problem, 
solved by making my own in a lathe. If you have any friends who are in the 
trade, you might try doing the same. Good luck!
