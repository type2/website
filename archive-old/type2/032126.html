Hi, folks:

The new engine is running fine, or at least I think it is.  Only problems
so far are little ones: Because it's so quiet, and it doesn't take the
same amount of time to warm up as the old one, I have to pay a lot more
attention to keep from flooding it when I start it after driving a while.
That sort of thing.  Carb now seems to have a slight flat spot at
moderately-low RPMs, but since the only real consequence of that seems to
be that it helps make sure I don't lub the engine, keeping it in the lower
gear a little bit longer, I'm not inclined to worry about it right now.

Friends are complaining that I no longer mark their driveways with drops
of oil, so I'm probably going to keep some used oil and a turkey baster
with me just to make them feel more comfortable during this transition.

One question though:  On start up, first thing in the morning, I get about
2 seconds of grey/white smoke [or, to be clearer, the bus does].  I don't
think it happens every time, but I might be wrong there.  What's the story
with that?

thanks
