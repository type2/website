Subject: Re: [T2] Interior roofing

&gt;This is one wild , off the wall idea to say the least---
&gt;They may only be 2x 2 ceiling tiles, but regardless, they will wind up
&gt;weighing more than the pop top--!!

Actually the tiles 2x4 are very light. Home Depot has a lot of different 
patterns.
The key here is insulation. I want to get some driving use out of my van 
this winter.
Maybe not the whole winter but some of it. This van has a pretty impressive 
heater
unlike some I've encountered or heard about.

&gt;Do some finger walking--and locate a marine, or RV upholstery shop--
&gt;They would have an outlet for the white / off white fuzzy glue on
&gt;headliner material--used in boats and Buses---

I think your missing the point. I'm not looking for a simple redoing of the 
upholstery
and making it look pretty. I want functionality as well as looks. Insulating 
the roof
of my van and heavy curtains (as well as standard panels in the walls, and 
good
floor insulation makes the bus warmer and quieter)

&gt;This makes a bunch more sense than gluing Office Depots ceiling on the
&gt;roof of your Bus--

Nope :-) I do have a neat idea for the roof, just wanting to see what other 
ideas
have been used / done.

Does this mean I have to take tons of pictures and show people the end 
results?
