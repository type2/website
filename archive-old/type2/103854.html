Dave, I took about the same approach as you, but I used a converter that was 
designed to let you run a white gas stove on propane. I like it because even 
though it also lacks a &quot;real&quot; regulator, it has six &quot;click type&quot; settings to 
adjust propane flow. On the second click, it equals just about 11&quot; WC, which 
is what the original stove was set to run on. On the sixth click, my stove 
approximates the sound of a Space Shuttle launch.
