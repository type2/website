Hey all..

I think I posted this before, but didn't hear much about it, so I'll have
another go at it...

Has anyone found any 6v gauges (specifically oil temp or pressure)?  I'd
like to put one in my '65 bug, but have only seen 12v in the few places
I've looked.

And yes, I'll be at Shoreline CC this weekend for my first show/swap
meet...Should be exciting..

Cheers,

Tom
