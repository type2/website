Subject: RE: fuzzy inside of poptop

The fuzzy stuff is to prevent condensation of vapor.
Actually is doesn't prevent it as much as keep it
from pooling in localized spots and dripping on the
lower inhabitants.

Best to leave it alone if possible.

i've been cleaning my new/old westy poptop and washed it down you know.
there was some mold spots on the underside -on the fuzzy hairs of my
poptop. what was the fuzz used for - insulation? sound dampening? i was
hoping to wash out the little mold spots, but couldnt get them out. at
least the underside is real clean now that i washed it and put it out to
dry all day in the 90*F plus heat here in so. CA yesterday. has anyone
done anything to the fuzzy stuff? like repaint it, respray it with some
other insulation material? i'm guessing now that its nice and clean i
better just leave it alone :)
