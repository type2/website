Reno to Juneau, wow that will be a climate shock, take a spare bus for
parts.  and get on good terms with Bus Depot and the other mail order
guys.  Do you plan on driving there (is it even possible??)  is this a
permanent move or just short term, if short term might be worth
mothballing the bus for the duration.

good luck
