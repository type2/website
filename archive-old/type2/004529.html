Subject: Fw: US Pride Day

Bus content...... I am taking my 71 HapyBus to Chicago for a trade
convention as opposed to flying next week.  It will be more fun anyhow.
Cant wait to get the 4 other suits and ties in there with me, I don't think
they really now what they're in for.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In memory of all those who perished in yesterday's events; the passengers
&gt; and the pilots on the United Air and AA flights, the workers in the World
&gt; Trade Center and the Pentagon, and all the innocent bystanders. Our
prayers
&gt; go out to the friends and families of the deceased.
&gt; Send this to at least 10 people to show your support. DONT BREAK IT.
&gt; Tomorrow is US pride day, everyone wear US colors (jeans are blue,
everyone
&gt; owns a white t-shirt, etc).  Try to wear as much red white and blue as you
&gt; can.  Send this message to as many other people you know.  Lets get the
&gt; whole country into it.  At least send it to 10 other people.  Thanks!
&gt;
