Subject: Re: [T2] Is this happening to you?

[...]Well said, and this expresses my feelings about the subject, to a &quot;T&quot;.

As vignet, my 14 year old son wouldn't be caught dead riding in the 71 Westy bus
a few years ago, although he did like riding in our 67 beetle.  Now, the bus is
his &quot;transporter&quot; of choice.  He says it's got &quot;soul&quot;.  A few days ago, he had
some friends over, and they all went out to see the bus at one point.  My son
showed off all of the camper features.  Made me smile.

We go on several camping trips every year, one of which is 11 or 12 hours driving

time from our house.  People are amazed that we have the nerve to go that far in
such an old vehicle.  What amazes me is why anyone would want to travel in
anything less reliable and easy to fix than an ACVW, no matter how old it is.  As

long as you maintain it properly, it'll treat you right.

I get all kinds of &quot;I used ta have one&quot; comments from people, and all I can think

is how lucky I am that I still have my ACVWs and didn't sell them like those
people did.

&gt; Listers,
&gt;         My perspective on this thread is one who has come back to VW after
&gt; about 15 years away. A chance encounter with a guy restoring an old Karmann
&gt; Ghia re-awakened my air-coooled interest. Now I have a 67 Bug and a 78 Bus.
&gt;         What has changed in the interim is the sense of community that now
&gt; exists among old VW drivers (and drivers of old VW's). It used to be that
&gt; driving a VW was more a matter of necessity, due to financial reasons. Now
&gt; its a choice made by people who love the simple genius of the design and
&gt; the uniqueness of the vehicle. So we all have something in common. We could
&gt; be driving the proverbial Honda Civic, but we want to feel connected to our
&gt; vehicle and its well-being.
&gt;         I work at a large university and gave a ride to a couple of
&gt; students yesterday. On the way I passed another Bus and the driver waved.
&gt; The students said &quot;do you know that guy&quot;, I said no, but in a way I do,
&gt; because he's driving an air-cooled VW. &quot;That's so cool&quot; they said and spent
&gt; the rest of the drive looking for old Volkswagens to wave to.
&gt;         I think people envy the connection we have to each other and our
&gt; cars, which accounts for the increase in spontaneous contact on the road.
&gt; In know it can be annoying, but take it as a compliment and smile.

&gt; &gt;Well, we choose to drive around in an archetypal symbol of kinder analog
&gt; &gt;times. I do it because it makes me feel like that. Other people like to be
&gt; &gt;reminded too. I reckon that it indicates the removal of a nice comfort zone
&gt; &gt;from our culture and all these people want it back. Lucky us.
&gt; &gt;       Be like your van, nice. Who else can do it?

&gt; &gt;Driving my split around town gets me the slack-jawed
&gt; &gt;&gt; gapers and the
&gt; &gt;&gt; occasional compliments, last week some guy in a &quot;Trans-Am&quot; gave
&gt; &gt;&gt; me the peace
&gt; &gt;&gt; sign....&quot;oh ick&quot;. I suppose they mean well, on the other hand
&gt; &gt;&gt; maybe they're
&gt; &gt;&gt; just being smart asses.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes I enjoy the &quot;when I was a kid, I drove across the rockies in one
&gt; &gt;&gt; of those...&quot; when I'm buying gas, and sometimes I've got other
&gt; &gt;&gt; things on my
&gt; &gt;&gt; mind; I always try to be nice and personable; I'm always hoping
&gt; &gt;&gt; for the one
&gt; &gt;&gt; time someone will come up and say &quot;You know, I've got a couple of those
