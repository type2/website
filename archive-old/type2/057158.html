Subject: fuel injection part / opinions needed
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello folks,
    I'm trying to locate a good used electronic control unit for my 1976
fuel injected bus.  I don't have the cash to buy a remanufactured one at the
moment, and need my car to run so I can get to work.  My bus is a 1976
model, manufactured in 9/75.  The part number on my current ECU is 0 280 000
122.  Please search through your &quot;junk&quot; boxes for me!

    Also, I'm looking for opinions about my diganosis of my bus that leads
me to believe that my ECU needs to be replaced.  The problem began while
driving one day to graveyard of mostly pre 67 beetles a few spilts and a few
early bays near my home in Maine.  It was running just perfectly and then
suddenly stopped running, as if I had turned the key off.  I coasted to the
side of the road and checked it out.  I first checked my plugs.  They all
looked good, and all sparked normally.  I had recently had a fuel clogging
problem, so I pulled the hose off at the beginning of the fuel loop, opened
the switch on the air box so my fuel pump would run, and watched gas pour
steadily out of the hose.  I repeated the process at the other end of the
fuel loop.  No problems.  I quickly checked my point gap and timing, just
for the hell of it, no problems there.  I then pulled the plug off of the #2
injector and hooked my test light up to the plug.  When I turned the engine,
the light didn't flash as it should, signifiying that my injectors weren't
being told when to fire.  I decided to give up for the moment and walked to
a friends house that happened to live a few miles down the road.  An hour
later my bus was on the back of the AAA flatbed on her way home (this is the
first time that she hasn't been able to struggle home under her own power
since I bought her, it was a sad moment).  At home I got out the multimeter
and checked out the air box, the resistor unit, and the double relay, and
all checked out fine.  I checked to see that the flap in the air box wasn't
stuck shut, and it moved freely.  Now I pulled the plug off an injector
again.  The positive power that comes from the double relay was fine... with
the light hooked to it and a different ground, it lit up.  The ground side
that comes from the electronic control unit didn't make it's ground
connection that is supposed to make the injector fire.  I checked continuity
of the wire form the #2 injector to the harness on the ECU, and there was no
break in the wire.  I traced the problem further on down the line by
checking to see that the signal that comes from the coil to the ECU every
time the points opens was good.  The signal came through fine on pin (or
plug or whatever) number one on the harness.  Now that the engine hadn't
been running for a few hours and had cooled off, it would fire for a short
time right as I'd try to start her up, but would quickly die.  I unhooked
the plug from the cold start valve, and she stopped firing quickly when
trying to start her cold.  That meant that the cold start valve was doing
it's job too, and also meant that I was getting power to the ECU.  My
diagnosis of the problem is that the part of my ECU that makes my injectors
fire every other time the points open is fried, but the rest of the ECU is
still functioning.  Is that possible?  Do I need a new ECU as I so strongly
suspect?  Does anyone have a used one laying around as described above?
Help please!

    Thanks for listening to my problem.
