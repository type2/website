&gt;Alright
&gt;Found out that it is easiest if not the only way to leave the tin on the
&gt;motor and pull it all together.
&gt;     Now the question for tomorrow???!!!  Got the engine all lose and 
&gt;pulled
&gt;out to where the long 3 inch (estimate) bottom engine bolts are free.(Had 
&gt;to
&gt;remove the coil to get it that far)  Got the wires all disconnected and on
&gt;the other side of the tin.  Now it seems that the tranny shaft is about 2
&gt;inches too long as I can get my hand up in side next to the pressure plate
&gt;and feel the shaft going still into the hole for longer than I can feel.  
&gt;It
&gt;almost seems like the shaft is coming out of the tranny with the motor.  I

I know on my 72 I had to remove the oil filler tube to let the engine clear 
the trans shaft and come down.  It's alot easier if you do this before you 
start taking the engine out.  I made the mistake of doing it after 
everything else was disconected and the engine was teetering on the jack 
with the danger of messing up the trans shaft or clutch parts.  I guess in 
this case the other guy is right.  It probably would have been easier to 
drop the motor and transaxel together.  I've never done it this way, but 
I've heard people say it's easier to do it this way even if you are just 
going to work on the motor.  Any body else heard of this?
