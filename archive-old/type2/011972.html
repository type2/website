Hello everyone, I just signed up on the list. My name
is Julio and I live in Vancouver B.C.  I am currently
looking for a westfalia,  I originally wanted a
vanagon but am finding that they seem to be far to
overpriced where I live.  For example a 81 to 82 westy
seems to go for around $6000 to $9000 canadian. And
everytime i go look at them, they are maybe worth only
around $3000.  So I have decided to look at bay
windows now, and I have a few questions.  From what I
understand from 1974 the westies have the forward
facing pop top with upper bed,  but what year did they
move all the cabinets to the drivers side?  Also could
you get stoves in them?  What options would a fully
loaded westy come with for say a 1978 or 1979 model. 
How much weight will the upper bed hold?  What about
heat in those models? Do any of you driving bay
windows have safety concerns for you or your family?
What should I look out for when looking at westy
busses?  Thank you all for your help.

Julio
