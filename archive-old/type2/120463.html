Subject: I finally did it....

I started tearing apart the engine compartment of my Bus. I ordered the
Flap kit from Busted Bus and figured.. why install this half-a$$ed, when
I could spend the extra few days and money and do it right.

So.. I took everything apart, I took all teh tin work off, the
alternator, carburetor, intake tubes, etc.

And now I have some questions.

It doesn't appear that my wiring is stock... actually it looks like it
was hacked. 

The way I understand it, I have the large positive battery cable that
goes to the starter. From the starter there is a wire that goes all the
way to the front of the Bus (I assume, I haven't looked at it). Then,
there is a red wire, rather thick... that goes from the starter to the
alternator.
Well, I've confused myself now... I always thought the large wire on the
alternator should go directly to the battery, and then the smaller red
wire should go to power the car accessories / ignition coil, right?

Well.. who knows.. I'll have to look at my Bently manual.

Never the less, there is a wiring harness. It has a plug connector that
connects to the back of the alternator, and then is about 2 feet in
length and connects to a silver colored box. I assume it's some sort of
relay. I have a picture of the wire.
The wires on this harness are butchered, spliced and reconnected in like
three places.. and they're brittle. I'd like to replace this harness..
where can I get one? 

I didn't see this harness at the Bus Depot?

The other question I have is.. I have the Webber Progressive conversion?
That's the 2 barrel Webber carb with the 4 intake runners.

Does anyone know where I can get the carburetor to intake tube rubber
gaskets?

This is a serious pain in the butt, but I know it's going to be well
worth it. I'll learn, not only how my Bus works, but I'll know that stuff
was done correctly.


Thanks!!!!

Todd
