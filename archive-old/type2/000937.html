&gt;Someone asked what gauges they would want their 16 year old to have
&gt;for a safe &quot;mega tour&quot;.

My answer would be:

	it's never safe for 16 years olds to go on a mega-tour alone,
	no matter what vehicle or how many gauges you give them.

But it's up to each individual to decide what they allow their children to
undertake.

Having said that, the bus needs a thorough check-up and reliable engine. If
it is now being overhauled you need to allow sufficient time to make sure it
really is reliable. In practice failures tend to show up in the first so
many hours after 'repairs'. And of course after a rebuild the engine needs
running in. Finishing the repairs just hours before they are about to leave
on a major trip is not a good idea.
I would say you need to allow for at least 2 to 4 weeks running the car
around town before sending them off. You have to realise that with older
cars problems can always occur so make sure these kids know what to do in
case of a breakdown. In these circumstances a working mobile phone is
probably the most important 'gadget'.

Just the other day I got a call from my son who is taking my '81 Vanagon on
a vacation in Germany / France. The car was well prepared but on the second
day he had a little melting / burning plastic under the dash. Turned out to
be the 4 position heater blower switch. He 26 now and knows nothing about
cars and probably never will (but ask him about applied physics and he's
your man). As he was in Germany I told him to find a VW dealer, so he did.
One hour later and 8 dollars lighter he was on his way again. If only every
problem was so simple .....
