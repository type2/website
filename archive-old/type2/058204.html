List,

Here is the deal I have a 2.0 L in a 74 westy automatic ... I had an
emergency ... drove the bus 2 1/2 hrs fairly hard (65-70 mph) ... I am not
sure if that matters but I threw it in just in case.  Stopped for gas and
when I turned the key, I get nothing in the way of engine turn over or
sounds from the starter.  I can hear the electric fuel pump clicking and I
get power to the dash.  Not knowing much about this thing yet (books are on
their way from Amazon_dot_com should get them today) I climb under the bus and
look for the starter in an attempt to try a screwdriver &quot;hot wire&quot; ... in
the mean time a guy who claims to know a little about VWs happens by and
offers to help ... I say OK ... he climbs under the bus w/ the screwdriver
and I turn the key ... we get a spinning sound from the starter, but no
engine turn over ... I says hey must be the starter, so I climb under and
proceed to take the starter off ... I get home and talk to another guy who
scratches his head and says the guy who used the screw driver may have not
touched the right terminals together, so I hook up some trusty jumper cables
to the starter and bam the starter gear jumps out and spins just like it
should.
My question now is ... #1 if I slap the starter in, I should be able to hot
wire it and get the bus home right???  #2 Is it the ignition switch or could
it be a million other things???  I am taking off for the 2 1/2 hour ride to
my bus at noon central time today to fix this thing and I still will not
have my manuals yet ... I found an archive on the ignition switch, but any
and all advice on what to check if I can't get this thing going would be
very helpful.
