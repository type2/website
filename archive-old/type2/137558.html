&gt;The 914 used a different sump plate that integrates an oil temperature

It's somewhat different.
The sender will read a bit cooler in a self-drilled plate because of where 
it is positioned.
The self-drilled plate positions the sender outside of the main crankcase 
in a slightly more sheltered area, and closer to the outside of the engine.
