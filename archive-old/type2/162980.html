Subject: Re: [T2] Splittie profiteering

Dave Bolen quoth:
&gt;
&gt;Whatever the market will bear.  You obviously haven't been paying 
&gt;attention to splittie prices.

	I didn't think I needed to, to infer that $26k is unusual. 
How wrong I was.

&gt;
&gt;I have seen 21 windows in absolutely pristine shape going for much 
&gt;more than that....some have been advertiesed for over $30,000....and 
&gt;sold.
&gt;
&gt;When you spend that kind of money, an engine rebuild is the least of 
&gt;your worries....pocket change actually.
&gt;
&gt;On the baywindow side, I have noticed prices have started creeping 
&gt;up...especially for single and double cabs.

	If the fuel price held within a factor of 3, we could at that 
rate expect a really good Bay in 2025 to fetch $30k (2007 $).  I 
believe it.  And by then I may have to sell anyhow as I could be too 
old to drive.  Looks like a solid investment for old age!  As a 
reason to take care of it, that's a strong boost  ...


thanx
