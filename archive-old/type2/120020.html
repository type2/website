Subject: Re: [T2] Engine &amp; Heater

On Thursday 18 December 2003 10:14 pm, you wrote:

I tried that...pulled and pushed them both. All that did was turn the fan off 
(or maybe the fan turned off on its own after a time because the heater was 
cool).


&gt; Hard to say, remember it's cold out and stiff is ok.

I've got the bus in the garage now so I can work on it. Hopefully between 
Christmas and New Years I can start the interior renovation.  


&gt; Tell him you want an engine for your bus and trade him :) Make him do the
&gt; work. Who knows what a motivated person might find.

Excellent!


&gt; I'll run into you at some point in person. Could be cool to caravan some
&gt; where :)

Yeah, that'd be great. Hopfully I can get the bus finished by next summer....
