&gt; Costco has these onsale- 195-75-14 load C.  $240.00 plus tax for all

westy?

For this size, you need load range D, not C.  Check the Max Load molded on
the side of the tire.  It should be 1545 lbs or higher.  The tires you
specified are 1435 lbs.

Westys are particularly affected by overloaded tires, as you are loaded
all of the time with the camping interior.
