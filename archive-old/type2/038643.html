Subject: Re: New Bus Nightmare

Gentlepersons-
                       Not to take sides but let's get our terms defined 
here. A &quot;complete
restoration&quot; is just that. Body &quot;off frame&quot; and every nut and bolt and panel 
is  re-
moved, spec'ed and either replaced or cleaned and re-used. Same for the frame 
itself.
The running gear is checked out and &quot;all&quot; wear parts are brought up to spec. 
The drive
train has the same treatment- engine rebuilt with new parts, trans rebuilt. A 
com-
plete rebuild uses only the case, and possibly, the crank and flywheel.
                       This type of restoration costs big bucks...Aside from 
the initial cost of
the vehicle, we're talking $20-30,000...Lower, if your labor isn't counted, 
higher if you
farm out the work. A good paint job is $2-5,000 depending on the amount of 
prep work
required. Maaco's $189 special isn't even a realistic price for a primer coat.
                       Most of the bus ads I've seen for &quot;completely 
restored&quot; , don't meet
this criteria...and not just buses, other cars, too. I'd suggest, a visit to 
a &quot;real&quot; antique
car show to see what a &quot;new&quot; old car should look like...
                       Beyond this definition, everything else is just a used 
car, and should be
purchased/sold as one. I don't quite know what &quot;mint&quot; translates as, but I'm 
sure I've
seen it as often as &quot;clean&quot; on corner used car lots...
                       So, if you're buying one, ask for verification of 
work. A front end that
isn't making any noises right now can be rusted through internally...GEX may 
have done
the &quot;only 1000 miles on rebuilt&quot; engine...etc. Other than faith, the only 
other solution is
to educate yourself mechanically or own a &quot;Jaguar two-piece tool kit&quot;- a pen 
and a thick
checkbook...
