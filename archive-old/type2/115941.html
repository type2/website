&gt; I am getting terrible gas mileage on a 78 FI with automatic

&gt; culprit?  Usually travel 65 mph or less.

Switch to electronic ignition for slightly better mileage.

You could also get your idle mixture tested and reset but I suspect you're
not going to get much of an improvement if any.

My engine is in good shape but it's clearly working hard to move the bus
through the air at 65mph...
