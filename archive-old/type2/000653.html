Well, my latest container-load from overseas finally arrived yesterday, a
mere six months after I ordered it.  Well, better late than never, I
suppose.  In any event, there are some gems...

Rear Brake Backing Plates, 71-79 bus, unavailable for years.  Genuine
Volkswagen w/VW labels still on them. Part # 211 609 425PR   $99.95/pair

Heat Exchangers, '68-71 bus, also fits pre-68 or bug but heater lever is in
the wrong place so you'd have to modify it.  Genuine German Volkswagen,
substantially heavier than anything sold today.  These are back in stock
again, but very likely for the last time, as my supplier in Europe is now
sold out. Part # 043 255 105PR   $179.95/pair.

Heat Exchanger, left only,'72-74 Bus, as above, Part # 021 256 091M  $139.95

Heat Exchangers, pair, Vanagon, as above,  Part # 071 256 091PR
$329.95/pair.

Hubcaps, chrome, 71-up Bus/Vanagon.  These are genuine VW/Hella hubcaps,
purchased in Europe but actually made in Mexico.  These are NOT the cheap
aftermarket Mexican ones sold today, they are much heavier duty and primered
on the inside.  $59.95 for a set of four and well worth it. They won't rust
out in 3 months like today's ones do.  Part # 251 601 151A4

Dual Carbourators, original German VW, 72-74 bus.  These are N.O.S. German
ones, not the cheap Brazilian knockoffs that surfaced a few years ago.  Can
also use on a later bus to convert from Fuel Injection, but you'd need the
linkage from a '72-74 bus to hook them up. These are quite a rare find, and
were $600 each when last available. Part # 071 129 030   $369.95/pair.

Plastic &quot;accordian tube&quot; between heat exchanger and body.  Part #  8243,
$19.95 each

Rocker Panels, weld-in replacements, right side is genuine VW, left side
Veng of Denmark, both high quality, $12.95 each (left: 211 809 585, right:
211 809 586)

Pocket Mechanic Repair Manuals from Peter Russek, full service manuals in a
glovebox sized format, printed in the U.K.  Part # 2949 for busses thru '71,
2950 for '72-79.  $12.95 each.

Window Regulator (the mechanism that rolls up the window), drivers door,
genuine VW (not Mexican as currently sold),  Part # 211 837 501 $29.95

For Vanagon owners, I also have some really nice tow hitches and mudflaps.
Email me or check the website Monday if interested.

Many of these parts are in limited quantity, so they're first-come, first
serve.
To order these parts via the website, go to
http://busdepot_dot_com/ASP/Search.asp , then either click on the link for the
Bargains page (which should list them all), or else click where it says
&quot;click here if you know the part number you're looking for&quot; and enter the
