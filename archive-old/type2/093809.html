Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix timing

Hi Casey,

The Pertronix is just another set of points so needs no different procedures to set the timing than normal points.

As for the spec of where to set the timing (5ATDC, TDC, 7.5BTDC etc) just use the same setting as for the 'normal' points.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; How do I set the timing on a 1600dp with a pertronix pointless ignition. 
&gt; What are the specs to set it to and how should I go about this procedure.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks all
