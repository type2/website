Subject: Re: [T2] Re: The reason my bus won't start...

&gt;I also have a bus with a red ground cable--and that is why I was able to buy
&gt;an unrunning bus for $650.

Me too. Weird trend... I've been VERY careful not to get them mixed up. I 
plan to replace them both to make them standard.

That's after I repair all the hoses. I tried to start my bus last week and 
it backfired. Consequently it blew every hose off the intake side....

Funny to me and scared the dickens out of my 3 year old boy and the dog.
