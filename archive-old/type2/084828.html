Subject: RE: [T2] Bumper color


&gt;Current limitation with powder coat is they don't have near as many colors 
&gt;and tints, but new colors are being introduced all the time. You can't mix 
&gt;custom colors at the shop site.

That problem may have passed as my friend went back to get a set of hubcaps 
powder coated to match the body color - in this case a custom color - and 
for a bit of extra cost they matched it just fine...

Rough looking old shop but they turn out good work. I normally look for 
clean shops (much like looking for a clean machinist's shop) thinking that 
would help ensure careful attention to my project but in this case my 
&quot;equation&quot; was throughly sunk...
