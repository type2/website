&gt;I've had
&gt; good luck using a

I would only go this route as an absolute, last ditch
effort, and even then, with MUCH trepidation...

Folks, I *cannot* caution people enough when it comes
to using these things! The disks are very thin, and
break *very* easily. They are also designed for hobby
work, not cutting through that much steel (though they
will do the job...).

That said, I've been using Dremels for close to 20
years without any problems (I wore out the first one I
bought;-). But *always* wear wrap-around goggles, if
not a face-shield.... 

My new(er) dremel is a variable-speed model (most
are), and the chuck/bit can travel between 5,000 and
30,000 RPM!!! So it doesn't take a genius to see to
see how a fragment from a broken wheel/bit can cause
some *serious* damage to the user's eyes and face.

Just be careful!
