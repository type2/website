Subject: Engine noise

Hello, 

I am trying to diagnose a new and unpleasant sound coming from my engine (1970- 1600 single port). I was doing a tune up after a long road trip and when I warmed the engine up I heard a tick tick tick sound coming from within the engine compartment. The sound kinda fades away (or gets muffled) when I put my head under the vehicle near either valve cover. Initially I thought it was the earlier sounds of a thrown rod but I read somewhere in the type-2 library that this tapping occurs with every revolution of the engine not every other rev as I am hearing.  Also Muir and others say you can hear a thrown rod when you let off the accelerator after running it at high RPMs, which I dont hear.  Any other ways to trouble shoot this sound? 

Thanks-  

Asaph
