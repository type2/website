Jeremy:
I hope you never went into 4th gear, if you were only going 45 at full throttle.

This is exactly how splitties were able to function with 30 and then 36 and 40hp
motors. Extreme gear reduction and top speed about 50 mph!

69 double cab

&gt; my faithful roadtrip buddy and we hit the highway. we were able to hold
&gt; about 45 mph on the flat spots, but quickly learned that the hills were
&gt; about 20 mph max.
