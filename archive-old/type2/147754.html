Guys-

Thanks for the tips... I do know that the injectors and one glow plug
were replaced before they left NC, also that the air filter is new.
Nate tells me the car runs well enough around 50 mph, but anything
above that it emits *huge* intermittent clouds of smoke and misses
badly. He also noted that it is consuming some oil, and that it
&quot;starts gradually&quot; when he fires it up. It's shutting off fine,
though... could it be a vacuum leak? He also said he checked the sight
glass for air in the fuel but didn't see any bubbles.
