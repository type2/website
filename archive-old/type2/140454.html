Subject: Re: [T2] Temp sensor II

From Darren Evans-Young:

The only thing I don't like, is sometimes I come back with some parts missing.
Nothing major though. Like, the plastic tab that goes into the
sheet metal where you adjust the belt tension. I just made a
cover out of some roof flashing and is held in place with existing
engine tin screws...works great.  The other thing I'm missing that
I would really like back..there were metal tubes, one on each side,
that takes the heat from the heat exchanges and sends it to the
outside rear of the engine when the heat is not going to the cabin.
I wonder if others have this and how important it is. I could
probably rig up something myself if I have to. I'd rather the tubes
though.

So he had the engine out to do a valve job and swapped the heads on you?

Why did he leave off the pipes?  That is kind of baffling.....

I do have a set of them. Do you still have the correct heat flapper valves with the exhaust hole coming off 
them?
