Subject: 15&quot; =?iso-8859-1?q?wheels=3F=3F=3F?=

 I know Mercedes wheels have been discussed as options for late models
&amp; vanagons (they are the same wheel, aren't they?) but I was wondering
if there were perhaps any cheap &amp; easily available 15&quot; wheels         
available for busses. 14&quot; tires are hard to find and really expensive 
in the proper weight/load class, but there seem to be tons of 15&quot;     
options. Just wondering if anybody knew of anything, or of any other  
issues which would be a factor.                                       
I seem to recall that there were some larger vanagon wheels, maybe    
even a 16&quot; wheel? I don't want anything too big, just thinking about  
options until I can put my 20&quot; spinners on there.                     
:)                                                                    
(just kidding about that last part)                                   
And yes, I am referring to the 72 and up wheel, not the earlier wide  
5.                                                                    
thanks,
