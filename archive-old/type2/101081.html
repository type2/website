Subject: Re: [T2] fuel sender/gauge?

Richard,

Wondered the same thing myself....

#1  I suspect that the voltage involved would *never* be able to
	turn the resistance wire hot before it broke...if even that.

#2  Same reason that oil tankers don't blow up....the air/volatile mixture 
	inside	the oil chambers is kept deliberately &quot;rich&quot;....not enough air and 
	it won't explode...

You obviously did not experiment enough with volatile liquids as a 
child....I still have a couple of scars from &quot;experiments&quot; of that nature.

LOL... what we make it thru as kids!


Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;You might also look at the wires and ground connection for the tank sender,
&gt; &gt;if you can still access it easily (actually, your mechanic should have
&gt; &gt;looked at these).  Those connections were pretty crappy when I checked mine
&gt; &gt;a couple weeks ago.  They are right there by the sender.  It's easy to
&gt; &gt;access on my bus because a PO had used a cold chisel to cut a home-made
&gt; &gt;&quot;access panel&quot; into the engine deck above the sender.  This has actually
&gt; &gt;come in handy, and is normally well sealed with duct tape.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of fuel senders, has anyone found it interesting that while the sender works it passes an electrical current while immersed in gasoline?  I assume this is an age old design that is inexpensive but why isn't this inherently dangerous?
