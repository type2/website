Subject: Re: [T2] headlight switches

My 05/71 bus has that parking light reminder switch. Always seemed kind of 
silly. During daylight it is too bright to see either the parking lights or 
the indicator light. At night you can see the glow from the parking lights.

&gt;  You're absolutely right, it's green. I think only the very early bays had
&gt;that light, maybe even 68-70 only? Tom
&gt;
&gt;&lt;Tom, shouldn't that little blue light be for your high-beams?
&gt;Should the green one come on with the parking lights?&gt;
