I posted earlier about low oil pressure readings.  After a 200 mile trip
this weekend, I've made the following correlation and realization.

Running a 2.0L with 10W-40 dino oil, I noticed that as the oil temp.
increased to the 210 degree mark while pulling 11,000 foot passes, the
oil pressure would drop to 20 psi.  As the oil temp would cool to 180
degrees, the oil pressure increases.  1st question.  Does this indicate
I'm using to thin an oil?  (I'm trying to make a direct correlation, not
asking for oil weight opinions or start another FART.)

Secondly, I did a little investigating yesterday and noticed two
things.  First, I have an oil leak from either a pushrod tube or valve
cover (cylinder #4 and/or the rear most pushrod tube where it connects
to the head, not the block).  It's hard to say were the leak is as there
is oil on each.  Could this be the cause of my loss of oil pressure?  Is
this a detrimental oil leak, or can I continue to drive it for another
200-1000 miles?  The heads, P&amp;C are less than 4k miles old.

Also, I noticed there was a lot of grime around the oil pump/oil filler
point of contact b/t the block and the cooling shroud.  Should this be
cleaner than it looks.  I intend to pull the cooling shround and
investigate when I get the time...

On a lighter note, I had a great trip to Leadville, CO this weekend en
route to climb Mt. Elbert, the second highest point in the continental
US.

Thanks in advance, keep on busin'
