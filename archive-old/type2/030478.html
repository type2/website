&lt;major, familiar sounding snip&gt; 

&gt; What am I missing? Is something still causing case pressure forcing oil out

Lynn,

I think high case pressure is your problem.  It sure does sound like you
have done everything right, plus if it were just PR tube leaks, that would
be one thing...  the rear main leaking after replacement raises the ante
a bit.  You ain't gonna like what I am gonna say... fortunately it is just
a personal theory and I am not expert.  Altho it mostly applies to older
engines, I will state it here because it may be applicable (did you put on
new heads? where did the new heads come from?  did they get new guides?)

My theory is that as VW engines age, the valve guides are among the first
casualties of age, with rings not far behind.  Once the valve guides and
rings have crossed a certain point, blowby and case pressure build to
stunning levels, far more than the various seals are designed to
accomodate.  The engine becomes a leaker at that point and there is very
little that you can do.  The cure is new valve guides and P&amp;C's, but at
that point a rebuild hardly seems justified because compression will still
be good, and even a leakdown test won't show much wrong (if it is only the
valve guides) but the leaks will continue, and new seals won't help.

I wish there were some reliable way of measuring case pressure, but I have
never heard of one.

If anyone has a better theory, I would love to hear it.
