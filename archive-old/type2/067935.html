Subject: Friday Bus fantasy

Welcome to your fantasy.  There is another crazed lunatic bus fanatic 
out there with IDENTICAL tastes as yours, with a couple of minor 
deviations.  This other person has lots of money and no conscience.
Well this other loon creates your perfect totally custom bus.  I 
mean a, chopped, channeled, sliced, diced, shortened, lengthened,
mixed and matched, creation that started out as a bus.  Every 
modification is done perfectly, every bolt fits correctly, no expense 
was spared in creating this masterpiece.  Of course, it will pass ALL 

smog and safety inspections.  This is YOUR perfect creation, built by 
someone that doesn't mind the destruction required for the creation.

Immediately after finishing and test driving your dream of a bus, the 
owner/builder is struck by the guilt of their destruction and falls over 
dead on the spot.  Well, their significant other, being so remorseful, 
calls the wrecking yard to have it towed away.  

Well it turns out that your best friend is the tow truck driver.  And 
your friend knows you well enough to know that this bus matches your 
dream bus.  Your best friend promptly delivers the bus to your 
doorstep (with signed title of course).  Yours, guilt free, cost free.

With the guilt free scenario set up.
What is your fantasy non-stock, modified bus?

- - Jeff
