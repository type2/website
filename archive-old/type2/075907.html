&gt; &gt; Earlier this year there was a thread on installing some sort of

&gt; &gt; incineration?  Priceless.  Are Vw's more prone to fire?  I think that
&gt;
&gt; I was curious as to how expensive it would be to put a simple manual Halon
&gt; system into my bus, what with all this fire talk making me very very
&gt; nervous. I remember this guy I worked with who had a porsche repli-car
&gt; with a type 4 engine who had a fire suppression system in it so I emailed
&gt; him and he pointed me to http://www.ioportracing_dot_com/fire.htm
&gt;
&gt; It seems they range around 400 bucks minus installation. All and all, it
&gt; doesn't seem too expensive to throw one in (especially considering I just
&gt; shelled out 600 bucks to get a new front axle beam installed).

There is no guarantee that such a system will work when fire time comes
along.  IMHO, the money would be better spent in getting the fuel system
and wiring in top shape, as it is much better not to have a fire at all
than it is to put one out.

One difficulty posed by the VW design is that the engine bay is actually
split into separate upper and lower compartments by the engine tin.  The
separation isn't complete, but it is enough to make it very tough for any
fire surpression system to do its job.

A typical VW fire is caused by the metal line that passes through the
front tin being sawed in half by the tin after the rubber grommet fails.
this produces a leak that spills fuel on both sides of the firewall.  The
fire starts when the fuel hits the exhaust pipe forward of the firewall,
but immediately goes through the firewall into the engine bay.  the leak
will feed the fire on both sides, as the tank is above the leak.

An extinguishing system in the engine bay will put that part of the fire
out, but it will continue on the forward side of the firewall.  When the
retardant dissipates, the fire will re-ignite in the engine bay.  A good
automatic system for a VW would have to be plumbed to flood both areas
with retardant, adding weight and complexity.
