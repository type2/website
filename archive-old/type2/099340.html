Subject: Porsche Mags

I am in the market for some 911 porsche mags for my 1972 bus.  Could
anyone help me out.  I would also like to thanks the list for helping me
out with ordering some CV boots.  I changed both boots and regreased the
joints on the right side.  It took me 8 hours, but then again it was the
first time for me.  I appreciate the links with all the pictures.  Now I
have to change the other side and then work on the front end.  The front
end be a first also.  Any advise?

Happy New Year

Dean
