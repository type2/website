Actually, I had posted a few times on the list about original curtains, 
and had a few replies, including one from you.  But in the end, I 
decided that I didn't want to let a second set of perfect original 
curtains fade to grey again.  So, the compromise fabric is really OK 
with me.  I appreciate the offer all the same.

If I parked in a garage and didn't drive the Bus very often, then I 
might consider a set of originals, since they would be protected from 
the sun.  But I would feel pretty guilty about letting another set of 
originals get ruined by daily driving.
