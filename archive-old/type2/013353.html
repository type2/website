Hey, one thing is bothering me. The boots
&gt;on the CV joints - They'er busted. Does anyone make a replacable boot that
&gt;doesn't require removing the axle? 

David:

Speaking of CV boots, I just received my order of CV boots from Rockford.  According to members on this list, the Rockford boots will far outlast any German or Brazilian boots currently marketed for our busses.  I have to say, comparing them to some brand new German boots I bought a few months ago, the Rockford boots are nearly twice as thick, and are made from materials developed for the Aerospace industry, whatever that means.  Anyway, they certainly appear to be of much higher quality.  With each boot kit, you get both clamps and a generous amount of synthetic grease.  I ordered directly from Rockford, and they charged me less than $11 per kit (4 kits required).  So, does anyone want to buy a set of 4 German CV boots?  I'll sell them for $5 and ship free anywhere in the lower 48.
 See the Rockford link:
