Message-ID: &lt;3714E4F0.D79AC5FE_at_uswest_dot_net&gt;

I was wondering if anyone can be of help??
need to move a bus from New Hampshire to Phoenix--the bus does run--but
i would prefer it to be towed or trailored to Phoenix--
i am willing to pay the expences and cost--just hoping the timing is
right that some one on the east coast is headed this way?--  jerry
