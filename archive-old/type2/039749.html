you misspelled Klingon's


onto bus stuff, VW built the type II many different ways for many
different customers, and as the current customer of this product, what you
do with it is your business. if you want a pink bug on the roof wellllll
(yes I have seen the bug)

I think the purpose of this list is to reduce the frustrations in trying
to do what one wants to do with thier own type II be it getting an engine
in right or trying to decide wheather or not to leave in the FI or change
to carbs, and there are as many opinions as there are owners.

onto the alternator thing, does anyone have the larger 70 amp type IV
alternator, even non functioning with the associated backing plate, air
duct and regulator...swap, trade, even for sale??
