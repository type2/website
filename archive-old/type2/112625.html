Subject: R: [T2] The Vengeange of the Generator!!!

Mmmh, right; but the battery does go down too easily... I could not find any
drain so this was the only chance I could think of;
I should check again with some stuff turned on, like high beam and wipers,
to see if there's difference; here in Italy now is mandatory to go 'round
with lights on even on midday, so that could be the problem.
