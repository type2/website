Depends upon your definition of small. Are you wanting to end up with a
keeper?

&gt;
&gt;2 bad areas under the windshield
&gt;some rust at front seat belt anchors
&gt;some rust in driver/front wheel wheel
&gt;rocker behing driver crushed in for about 2 feet
&gt;each rear corner some dents
&gt;engine lid small dent
&gt;front roof small dent
&gt;sliding door some scrape/dent as well as panel after slider.

Figure a minimum of $2000 for rust removal and panel repairs with some
sweat equity on your part to have a straight chassis, metal sealed and
ready for finish coats prep and spray. The majority of another grand to do
the top coats and you reinstall the lights and doors and widows and latches
and handles and hardware with new seals. Figure more for what you find upon
disassembly that you are now not aware of and you will surely find to bust
your budget if not allowed for before you buy.

For a typical beat up example expect to have at least $5000 and perhaps a
hundred unskilled manhours in it to make it perty, safe and reliable. 

You can expect to spend three or more unskilled manhours for every skilled
hour you could buy. The ratio varies greatly umongst individuals depending
upon their attitude and aptitude.
Mediocre results add very little if any actual value with regard to resale,
unless your just trying to put up a facade to sell to the unknowledgable,
in which case get the Schibe or MAACO treatment and sell it before the
pealing starts. 

You could be much better off to find something that someone just spent
$5000 on (documented by receipts, all from reputable factors) and wants out
for $4000, then put a coupla grand more into it to resolve a few remaining
defects, for unless you get incredibly lucky, anything for sale needs
something the current owner doesn't think is worth fixing and keeping.
Never pay for something full of parts not made in Germany without allowance
for replacing with the higher value parts. Run from any underdash cut and
splice problems if you are not skilled in auto electrics. The more things
are stock and straight, the more value present.
