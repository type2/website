&gt;&gt; There was no Astro van in 1976, they started in 1985.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps there is better information for this ?

Unlikely, but you never know...I called Advance and they offer a coil-over shock for the late bus,
Monroe Sensa-Trac, $ 93 / pair, and regular shocks for $ 14 ea. They also list KYB rear shocks,
$ 36 ea, and there is only one shock (?) available to all of Advance in the USA in Andersonville, Tenn.
until they order some more. All of these shocks are limited lifetime warranty.
I do recall a friend who had a Chevy van ( not an Astro ) in 1976 which had a bumper sticker that read:
( If this van is rockin'... ) but i don't think i would have recommended those shocks 8^).
