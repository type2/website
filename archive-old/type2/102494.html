Subject: Re: [T2] 74 Bus --Carburetor problems?

Hi Chris,

Not a lot of info to work with, it would help if we knew which carb you 
have.

My best guess would be that the float has gone bad, and the valve in 
the carb has now opened, letting fuel fill the carb directly from the 
tank.

You had best get this corrected ASAP, because the fuel leaking into the 
carb will flow through the carb and into the cylinders, contaminating 
the oil and potentially even hydraulically locking up the motor. I'm 
not saying it's that bad yet, but you should get it tended to before it 
gets worse.

Gas in your oil can do a lot of damage to the life expectancy of your 
engine.

Happy trails,

&gt;
&gt; i just bought the bus and for the last year it didnt
&gt; really run that much
&gt;
&gt; noticed a strong gas smell and gas dripping from the
&gt; carburetor....
&gt;
&gt; anyone know the cause? doesnt seem to be coming from
&gt; the fuel lines but the carburetor itself...
&gt;
&gt; any help would be very much appreciated
