&gt; Ok, as I mentioned earlier, my brain cells are on vacation. For the

&gt; I'm thinking overrich mixture and/or fuel somehow getting in after the
&gt; ignition is cut. It's not a temperature thing.

Hard to say exactly but I was given some advice by Mark Dearing wrt my
friends bus when it was dieseling and he said the throttle plates probably
weren't closing all the way. Sure enough that was it.
