&gt; OK, it's Friday....

&gt; First, Ferndale to Capetown on CA211 in California.  Crossing the coastal
&gt; range on a two lane road.  The altitude is not great, but you are doing
&gt; 2Kfeet in 2-3 miles!  And the drive down is worse... this is the only time
&gt; I have ever lost brakes due to overheated pads.  A scary experience.


Ok,,, seeing as the hills are far worse on the Left coast,, and the hills on the
right coast have skeerd me,, I will make sure I take extra brakes with me when I
finally make it out West.

The Cabot trail in Nova Scotia has a sign that says the road rises 900 ft, in
900 ft.  and I was following a hiway coach to the top.... Just a short thing is
comparison i guess,,,,then the trip down,,, with a Vanagon with brake fade,, and
a motor home with belt driven brake assist with a worn out belt, following
me!..... That was a trick to not alert the other passengers why I was skeerd!
