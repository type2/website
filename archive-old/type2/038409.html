Subject: broken stud removal

Volks,

There are a million and one tricks for removing a broken stud, and if you
are a machinist/pro or have a spare head waiting to be popped on, go ahead
and try them.  BUT... if you are just starting out, or it's your daily
driver then the answer to &quot;How do extract a broken stud?&quot; is that you
take it to a competent machinist.  Right away, without trying anything.

If you bring it to him now, with a couple threads still on it and 3/4&quot; of
stud sticking out of the head, he will pat you on the head, talk down to
you a bit, take it in the back room, remove the stud in 5 minutes, and
charge you $5-50.

If you bring it to him after you have broken the stud off below the
surface of the head, then drilled into the stud and broken off a easy-out
in the remains, he will look at you, look at the head, and start into his
&quot;I'm busy&quot; routine.  If you are very lucky he will give you a long lecture
about &quot;do-it-yourselfers&quot;, tell you how important the other work he has is
and how long the lead time is, tell you how many hours it is going to take
(at $50/hr), accept the job, and give you your bus/head back in a week
along with a $100-150 bill.

Even if you have to pay $50 to have your bus towed up to the machinist,
not doing it yourself turns out to be *much* cheaper, honest!
