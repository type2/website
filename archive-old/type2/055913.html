Does anyone have any experience with Web Cams Inc., of Riverside, CA?
(Not the same as Weber [Webber?] Cams, to which I found a couple of
references in the Vanagon_dot_com archives -- the type2 search engine does
not seem to be working).  I'm about to have an experience with them,
since I'm sending back the &quot;Johnson&quot; hyd. lifters they sold me (to go
with the hyd. cam I bought from them); and I'd like some advance warning
as to whether this experience is going to be a good one or bad.  One of
the lifters has a partially disconnected retainer clip (not to be
reused, they say), and it and several others show abnormal wear
(particularly the exhaust lifters, which have an X pattern of the face
now).  They are out of a type IV I built about 2500 miles ago, which was
making noise.  I'm planning to send the cam back too, to be checked out
for damage (I haven't got any of those fancy measuring tools, alas).

Thanks,
Eric Forsman (1974 Westfalia)
