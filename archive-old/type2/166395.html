Subject: [T2]: Head swap with installed engine, strange push rods and
  great list member

Hello all,

just wanted to show you some pictures of my head swap with engine
installed (stock 2liter, dual carbs, solid lifters). I had to do it on a
public parking lot, so dropping the engine was not an alternative. Heck,
I couldn't even jack the bus up... It was a major PITA and these
pictures should convince you that you shouldn't do it this way:

The spare head I installed is not new and already has some slight cracks
near the valve seats. This is a temporary fix to let me drive the bus
for occasional short trips (less than 10 miles).

One list member, Marcus Schaper, was so kind to sell me his almost new
AMC heads that I will be installing in the near future after new valves,
guides and seats have been installed. Thank you very much, Marcus. This
list is great!

I do have one question though: What could cause the push rods to look
like the ones in the first two pictures? I have no clue. Apparently push
rods for solid and hydraulic lifters are different in length and
diameter. Anybody got some numbers?

And there are also some pictures that remind me why I spend so much time
and money in my bus:
