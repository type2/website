Subject: Re: [T2] Buses with watercooled engines

Since it was my post that sparked this, let me reply first. In fact,
Mark, you gave me my best argument:

&quot;Aircooled buses make the world a richer, more diverse place. Buses say
loudly that &quot;there is no one right way&quot; to make a vehicle, and they do
that (again, IMHO) better than any other vehicle on the road.&quot;

There's no right way!

My way isn't right for you. Your way doesn't have to be right for me either.
