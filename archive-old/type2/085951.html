Subject: Mo-Kan Show--Topeka, Kansas.  May 31 and June 1 and 2.

Got the following message last night.  Pasted below is a copy of the press 
release for the event.  I highly suggest making plans to be in Topeka, 
Kansas, on the weekend of June 1, 2002.  This is one event not to be missed. 
  If you can all keep a secret, we are trying to show the other VW people 
just how much more fun life can be as a bus person.  Please make an effort 
to come, you won't be sorry.
&gt;
&gt;Are you going to the VW show in Topeka 6/1/02?
&gt;We've been hearing some things about it but not much.  Got
&gt;any ideas of the scale of it?  will there be a swap meet?
&gt;We're looking forward to it, hoping to get ideas for the '56
&gt;resto project.

Mo-Kan Volkswagen event moves to Heartland Park

June 1, 2002.  Join area Volkswagen enthusiasts for the Bug Blitz/Bus Blast 
and you could go home with a rebuilt engine from Bugs and Buggy?s of 
Pleasant Valley, Missouri.

Volkswagen folks from around the midwest will gather at Heartland Park Race 
Track in Topeka, Kansas, over the weekend of June 1, 2002, for the Bug 
Blitz/Bus Blast.  The show, an regular event for the Mo-Kan Volkswagen Club, 
has been moved from Kansas City to Topeka in order to accommodate a larger 
venue and audience as well as  a camping event.  This year?s event will 
feature camping, starting Friday evening, May 31, 2002, a car show and swap 
meet on June 1, and all attendees are free to enjoy the Dirt Track Races on 
Friday night and the SCCA races, including Super Vee classes the day of the 
show at Heartland Park.

In order to simplify event costs, Mo-Kan presents the $5 deal.  Anyone 
wanted to camp, enter a car in the show, or attend the show will pay $5 for 
each event.  Passes to the race pits will also be available for an 
additional $5.  Campers and show-goers who wish to drive the road course 
will be allowed to follow a pace car on Sunday morning for another $5.  
Those wanting to set up for the swap meet will pay a $20 space rental fee.

The highlight of this event will be a raffle to benefit The Children?s Spot 
in Kansas City.  The Children?s Spot is a nonprofit organization which 
focuses on preschool aged children with developmental disabilities.  Raffle 
tickets will be available on the day of the show.  The raffle, which should 
run during the entire day of the event, will feature prizes donated by 
businesses from across nation.  The headlining prize will be a rebuilt 
engine courtesy of Bugs and Buggy?s, a newly opened Volkswagen shop in 
Pleasant Valley, Missouri.

For more information on this Volkswagen event call Pink Newell at (816) 
587-2838 or Rick Taylor at (785) 862-1506.  You can also visit
