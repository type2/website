Subject: [T2] What' next : a Volkscedes ? (Friday posting low bus content)

What is the world coming to?  In the old days most car manufacturers had
their own unique designs. A Ford was a Ford and even an English Ford was
distinctively different from a German Ford let alone an American Ford.
Nowadays the few remaining car manufacturers are badge-engineering cars on a
large scale. Ford ownes Mazda, GM is streamlining all its brands. Chrysler
was sold out to the Germans, etc etc. And soon the one design that I thought
was still an original, the current VW Transporter, will also lose it's
uniqueness.

VW already has several partnerships aside from 'owning' AUDI, SEAT, SKODA
and a few other expensive 'names' like Rolls Royce (to be changed into BMW
hands) and Bentley. The VW-Sharan minivan is also available as a Ford, VW
re-marketed a Toyota pickup at one time and the LT was built in cooperation
with MAN. With the next generation Transporter (bus) it's all going to
change again.

I recently noticed that the current VW-LT (a van one size up from the
Eurovan) looks suspiciously like the Mercedes Sprinter. Then I found out
that VW and Mercedes jointly own and operate the new plant in Hanover that
produces the LT and Sprinter on the same assembly-line. This plant will also
produce the next generation bus (T5). This again will be a common design so
that VW and Mercedes can share the development cost.

In my view the last 'real' Transporter was the Vanagon. Although looking
very modern in it's days it still retained many of the characteristics of
the original 1949 design (basic construction, rear engine). The Eurovan was
a clean break with the past. I like mine but effectively it could be made by
anyone. Come to think of it ... it also looks a bit like the Mercedes Vito.
Are they already related ?

Happy Holidays,
