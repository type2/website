Subject: Re: [T2] petrol smell in cab

Hi Sam,

Before you pull the tank, take a few minutes to inspect ALL of your 
fuel lines and their connections. Also inspect the filler neck that 
runs between the tank and the hole in the body. Another overlooked 
location is the vent lines running along the top of the engine 
compartment; these have rubber fittings that often crack with age.

Happy trails,

&gt;
&gt; Can anyone offer any suggestions as to where to start? I understand 
&gt; you have to pull the engine to replace the fuel tank.....is the only 
&gt; answer to my problems? Is there any other way of patching it if I find 
&gt; where the damage is?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
