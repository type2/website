&gt; I'm not sure why, but my 79 seems to hesitate when I press on the gas 
&gt; pedal. It doesn't happen everytime. It occurs more frequently when going up 
&gt; hill. I feel like I loos power for a second. then its like it suddenly 
&gt; kicks in and starts having a lot of power. Then it goes back to no power. 
&gt; This happens in like a 10 second time period. I have weak power. Then it 
&gt; feels like no power for a second and then awesome power for a couple 
&gt; seconds, and then just weak power again. Some times it isn't a problem at 
&gt; all, but sometimes all of a sudden I can't even make the speedlimit and I 
&gt; get scared I'm gonna break down. Thanks for your advice.

a few things come to mind for me. One is a intermittent clog in the
fuel line. Perhaps a piece of trash that keeps getting in the way at
the tank? Another possibility if a bad ground w/ the Temp Sensor II.
Yet another is a pump that isn't working all the time. One last thing
to check is the friction path on the AFM. Mine was having trouble
making contact at one time an causing a bad surging. I was able to
find this out by measuring the resistance across two of the terminals
on the AFM. At a few spots the resistance just dropped off to open, so
I knew that is was in bad shape. HTH
