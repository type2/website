Subject: Re: [T2] Throwout bearing clip problems

What do you think of the clips with a loop, and how do you go about safety
wiring them? To what?  I just replaced my throwout bearing and have the
trans in my basement, so this is the time for me to do it. Tom

On your throwout bearing...  since this has happened multiple times....
Have you checked the fork?  If the throwout fork is bent or cracked it can
allow this to happen.  Lay a straight edge across the bell housing and
measure the distance to the fork on each arm.  It is far better to use a
dial indicator, but even a steel rule is better than nothing.  The
distance from the straight edge to each of the arms on the fork MUST be
identical.  Also look for cracks on the weld where the arms attach to the
shaft.

                             OOK!
