I had a crack at the threaded bottom of my water tank. I tried a number of
list member suggestions, but none would hold with enough strength when I
threaded the water pump back into my tank. I tried super glue, JB-weld, and
a Loctite product. The super glue was useless, JB-weld was recommended by a
list member and held fairly well, and would probably work for a crack that
is not under stress. The Loctite glue (I can't remember product number)
seemed the best for my situation, but would still not hold up when the water
pump was inserted.

I ended up getting a replacement water tank from Karl. But, I would try the
Loctite glue if I had a crack in a location other that the threads for the
water pump.
