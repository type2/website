Subject: new fuel pump push rod installation
Message-ID: &lt;283e432e.244d00e2_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have a new mechanical fuel pump pushrod to install in my 1700 pancake type 
4 engine.  Whats the deal with something about turning the engine to the 
highest point and measuring this and that and installing so many gaskets to 
make it like so, I'm an idiot when it comes to this stuff so any help would 
be appreciated.

Thanks,
Shawn
