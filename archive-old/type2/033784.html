Subject: RE:  Various questions about my 73 bus...

&gt;I want to add an oil pressure sensor (not a switch, but a sensor) and 
&gt;a tach to my bus. I think I shouldn't have a problem with the tach, but 
&gt;was wondering if anyone had a good source for one. I would like to 
&gt;mount it in the spare gauge hole in my dash (I guess it was an option 
&gt;to have a clock in the spare hole) if I could...

VDO is the way to go.  They make a 3 1/8&quot; tach (approx $100) that (with the
use of a $10 adapter ring) fits and looks stock.  Check with Bus Depot, Bus
Boys, or any of the VW FLAPS for VDO stuff.  Only other option I'm aware of
is to get a cheap-o 2 1/8&quot; from someone like JC Whitney and either mount it
under your dash or devise your own mounting method in the spare hole.

&gt;I want to add an oil pressure sensor as well so I can get a reading of 
&gt;oil pressure (not just an on/off light). I have been told that there are 
&gt;two types, electrical and ones with a tube that runs all the way from the
engine

Again, go VDO.  You need the dual sender (gauge + dummy light) and the
matching gauge.  Together they'll cost about $70 new.  You probably also
need the adapter hose.  Since the sender is a lot bigger diameter than the
stock dummy light sender, it doesn't fit under the distributor or through
the hole in the engine tin.  VDO sells an adapter hose for about $20 that
screws into the stock location and allows the sender to be mounted outside
the tin.  One listee, Ian, installed his sender directly in the stock
location and it seems to fit OK, but that's up to you.  

For a cheaper alternative, you can go to the local pick-n-pull and look for
early 1980 Audis or Porsche 924s with a 2 1/16&quot; oil pressure gauge.  Pull
the gauge AND sender since they are a matched set.  A lot of them are in bar
instead of psi - no problem, just remember that a bar is something like 14
psi.

&gt;How many amps can the alternator supply?

This one is best left up to the electrical geniuses on the list, but the
stock alternator is rated at 55 amps (model AL 75X).  The later buses had an
optional 70 amp alternator (model AL 108X) that is an exact bolt-on deal and
can be had used at the junk yards or new or rebuild from the VW FLAPS.
