Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap FI ECU/AFM replacement!

That's an awesome idea!  I'd love to play/help out with the program. 
Need an beta testers?  100 bux isn't bad at all..

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I thought I'd share my future FI plans with the list. Perhaps other folks
&gt; with FI problems would be interested.
&gt; 
&gt; I was planning on engineering my own FI control module to replace the
&gt; ECU/AFM on my bus. I've wrestled with the stock FI setup a couple of times
&gt; now - and while I understand it very well I'm unhappy with how time
&gt; consuming and expensive tracking down a problem and repairing is. After I
&gt; had a design roughed out on paper I found someone else that had done very
&gt; much just what I had planned - with even more neat tuning functionality than
&gt; I had planned. This controller was designed by Bruce Bowling and Al Grippo
&gt; who are part of a DIY EFI group. The HW and SW design is complete and they
&gt; have a web site where the whole design exists - free for use by any
&gt; Do-It-Yourself'ers:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.bgsoflex_dot_com/megasquirt.html
&gt; 
&gt; There is also a yahoo group for discussion of the MegaSquirt:
&gt; 
&gt; http://groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/megasquirt/
&gt; 
&gt; Let me add some info regarding this controller and FI VW busses:
&gt; - It would replace your ECU, AFM, cold star valve, thermo time switch,
&gt; double relay, wiring harness, and balast resistors
&gt; - It would utilize your existing injectors, fuel pump, and pressure
&gt; regulator.
&gt; - It needs to be tuned for each style engine based on Volumetric Efficiency
&gt; (VE).
&gt; - It costs about $100 in parts and perhaps another $50 for parts for wiring
&gt; harness as well as an oxy sensor.
&gt; - The controller needs to be build yourself - as well as the wiring harness,
&gt; etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce and Al sponsored a group-buy of all the components - as well as the
&gt; PCB and case. I was able to sneak in on the tail end of this group buy and
&gt; so in a few months I may have one up and running on my bus. There seems to
&gt; be quite a bit of interest in this design - so I assume that someone will
&gt; sponsor another group-buy in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; I think this is a great way to utilize parts of our existing FI setup -
&gt; while updating to something that will be more maintainable (time and money
&gt; wise!) in the future. Of course it will require a fair amount of
&gt; soldering/fabrication skills to implement, so it certainly is not for
&gt; everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions/comments are welcome.
