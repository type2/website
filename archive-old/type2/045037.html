Subject: [T2] BugOut see you there

Hey gang,
Just wanted to give a heads up, I will be taking all
my spare stuff to the bugout.Leaving around 4am on
Sunday from Arnold, Md. I will be vending in a 67
faded/rusty Pearl white camper w/a fat Grateful Dead
Steal your Face in the back window, and if timing
works out Steve Dolan should be vending right next to
me.  Feel free to stop by. Hopefully I will have a
small TV or radio w/batteries to watch/listen to the
US Guatemala soccer game _at_2pm.  
Items of iterest to be sold:
67 Bug radio w/face plate
Westfalia tire cover 68-72
couple sets of 68-72 bumpers front and back
Upper and lower child cots nice!!!
cabinet handles galore
blue/green plaid material
blue green plaid front seats
a couple engine lids both 68-75 and 76-79
will have pictures of the 1970 Westfalia I will be
selling for $400, this van is worth it, all it will
need is some TLC and an engine.

Hope to see you all there. Have a fun and safe Labor
Day weekend those that are in the US,

Patrick
67 Westfalia SO42 Benchseat
