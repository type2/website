&gt; hello guys    this and the way the exhust was designed are two of the biggest

&gt; dropping the # 3 valve.  I have been telling everybody with type 4 and
&gt; waterboxxer 
&gt; motors to run high test gas.

Good advice, Mark. That, and a CHT gauge will save you in many instances
before the damage is done.

You will also probably see a trend that more of the dropped valves are in
injected buses than carbed, and of the carbed buses, the 1.7 drops more than
the 1.8. The worst is the later 2.0 injected buses, the combination of
restrictive exhaust and heads and a very lean burn fuel system was/is
deadly. There are ways to counteract this.
