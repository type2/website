Subject: Double Cab Tranny noise...

I have a freshly built 091 in my 68 DC &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot;. It shifts perfectly in
all gears running 85-90w GL4. All of the transmission, axles, shift rods,
baskets and bushings are new and lubed.

 

However, when the transmission gets warm it gets loud &quot;backlash&quot; noise
radiating from the tranny. It is really loud at highway speed deceleration
and 3rd gear deceleration.

 

Oddly, this is the same noise I had in my '70 DC and that transmission was
in perfect shape as well.

Is the noise common to Double Cabs because of the open space directly above
the transmission?

I talked to some racers and they said they have the same noise because they
don't run bushings, just metal-to-metal. I am using the factory mounting
system.

Any DC owners out there with similar noises?
