Cooper has a nice website with lots of info:

http://www.coopertire_dot_com/tires/cooper/srmiirad.htm

It's interesting that they also list a 195R14, a size I haven't seen
before in a tall height/width ratio.  This might be an option for
those attempting to get back to the rolling radius of the original
bias-ply tires.

Hi all,

Thought I'd comment on Cooper tires.  I've been running a set of LT Coopers
(Discoverer I think) on my Bus for over a year now and I love them.  The
sizes are 235/75/15 on the rear on a 7&quot; rim and 205/75/15 (not sure if still
available in this size) on the front on a 6&quot; rim.  I bought Coopers because
I run my bus offroad a lot and wanted a tire with a fairly aggressive tread
and a long life.  Mine have a 100,000km warranty, if they wear out before
the 100,000km I get the equivalant percentage off another set.

Even though these tires were bought primarily for offroad use (All terrain
style) they are great on the road and with minimal flex in the sidewall they
corner well and are reluctant to  &quot;let go&quot; I also occasionaly run the Bus up
to about 140kmh and don't worry about sidewinds and trucks coming the other
way.  In saying this though I do have swaybars front and back with
adjustable Koni shocks.

These rears may be too big for a standard engined Bus but with the V8 I have
in the back the 235/75 are no problem.  I haven't noticed any great load on
the steering box with the 205's on the front but I try not to turn the wheel
while the bus ain't moving.

Basically, I have no problems with 205's on the front or sidewinds or mud or
freeway.  All up it makes the Bus a pleasure to drive, and yes, I have run
it with standard wheels and tires and with low profile tires on a 15&quot; rims
etc.

Cheers
Steve
