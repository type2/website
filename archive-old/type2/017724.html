Subject: Bus Depot --  First order

Regarding the recent thread on Bus Depot, here's my two pence.  Placed my
first order with them by website on Tuesday morning.  Got e-mail
confirmation twice that same day.  Today is Friday, and the box was on the
doorstep when I stopped home for lunch.  Everything present and in good
condition, except the &quot;sermons&quot; CD which was shipped separately.  Good
thing, too, as the muffler and tailpipe in that box might have played havoc
with it...

Of course, &quot;for example&quot; is not proof.  But it is one example of durned
quick and good service.  Bus Depot will definitely get my next VW order.
Ron and his staff get a big &quot;attaboy&quot; from me; thanks guys!

P'rfesser
72 bus, &quot;Maureen&quot;
