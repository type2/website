The '71 uses two identical 12mm bolts per side, '73 and later uses 14mm bolts 
and the top ones have a thick collar which the bottom one on these do not have.

The partnumber for the '71 bolts is: N 010 127 4    and their size: M12x1.5x30, 
the partnumber tells me it is a standardized bolt, with no special collar.

Hope it helps,

Brian
