Subject: BBTA trip report, part Deux (Long!)

In this post I continue my trip report, and try to do
justice to the experience of the second day of BBTA.

Thomas, awake at 6:45, is excited and ready to start. 
I notice his lip is swollen, and then notice the half
dozen or so mosquitoes circling inside the tent.  Even
though we had been careful, and even though it's a
pretty pricey tent, they got us anyway.  The first
night's sleep was miserable.  Our pillow were soaked,
and the sun, even that early in the morning, was
beating down.  Nonetheless, we got up, and Thomas was
able to have a transforming, pivotal life experience:
eating cereal from the mini-box.  He liked it so much
he had three.  We began the day by looking for someone
to pay for camping, but Bill was still asleep and the
main office was deserted.  Then we started the rounds
of seeing who was there.  Our friend Brad from
Bloomington (I will use only first names here- I don't
want to offend those whose last names I can't remember,
and it helps in protecting the guilty) was there with
his dog and funky (multiple piercings, funky hair
color^Å) friends.  Thomas is a loyal guy, and he
remembered Brad from last year.  Brad's distributor had
lunched on the way there, but he was in the process of
trying to get it back in for the caravan, which would
begin to gather in an hour or so.  We found Ted, who
decided we needed to roust Charlie Ford, but Charlie
proved unroustable.  I walked over to make peace with
the split window guys, and as I suspected, they were
decent folks.  I talked to the kid who owned the
ambulance (it's wonderful to see one outside a book)
who told me that he pitied my driving a bay window.  He
said that if I drove a splittie just once, I would be
hooked.  I asked  him how fast his bus went, and he
said the top speed was around 52 mph.  He also said he
only drove it on weekends.  I smiled- that's what you
can do when you're old and you like someone and you
know they're full of shit.  I talked to Steve from
Texas, who told me (and everyone else later) the sad
story of a vanagon that after a great deal of effort
had been smashed just before he came from Texas.  I
thought the bus that he was driving was just fine, but
I could tell how disappointed he was.  
The Texas folks were easy to talk to, perhaps because
they are closer to my age, then some other groups
there.  But I want to make the point here that unlike
some contrived festivals (Burning Man, I suspect, is
beginning to fall into this category) BBTA succeeds
because everyone there has already ponied up admission
to an exclusive club.  Some people (I'm think of the
Eurovans I'm still lusting over here) have given up
more money- others, especially those who drive
splitties for hundreds of miles, have more sweat
equity.  But even the most rusty bus, even the most
common bus, is appreciated, and so is its owners.  Bus
people have a different kind of way of looking at the
world.  It's finding a beauty in poking fun at
something while loving it to death, it's a vibe which
says in the inarguable manifestation of rubber, oil,
and metal that getting there is the most important part
of any journey.  Everyone smiles, from the balding
gray-hairs to the 16 year olds with their first bus-
everyone is genuinely happy to be there, and they're
happy you're there too.  
Walking around on Saturday morning Thomas and I found a
rare prize: a child's hammock (brand new, or nearly so)
from a '76 Westy.  Brooks (whose new baby post I made a
few weeks ago) has been looking for one, and so we
handed over some of the back up (ashtray) money, and
put it into the bus.  I bought some loaf busy toys (the
first I've every found that I could afford), a couple
of bumper stickers from Charlie, a couple more from the
Texas crowd (my favorite: Too Slow? Too Bad!) and two
fanbelts- I could relax about the trip home now.  
I realize that this post is now stretching out: it is
difficult to do justice to what happened next- the
caravan of 60 or so busses that took a trip through the
Saturday heat deep into my memory.  As Bill assembled
everyone and told the route, I became even more
excited: we would be going not only on two ferry
crossings, but, most importantly, over the same Lewis
and Clark Bridge at Alton whose documentary had
compelled me to remain awake until 3am a few weeks
before on PBS.  If I write all the words that the
pictures in my mind of the trip evoke, this will take
forever, and it's late.  Here are some random
snapshots: waiting for the first ferry across the
Illinois two busses pull up in back of me (I'm at the
end of the first group because I have a CB) and one of
the drivers pulls out a photo album as we wait of his
Vanagons and busses; two ferries crammed full of busses
(the way it should be! I shout on the CB); crossing (in
a few hours)some of the great rivers of the world (the
Wabash, the Mississippi, the Missouri, the Illinois); a
stand selling cookies and pies in the September heat;
Henry (of VW Trends) riding with Thomas and me to
photograph the busses from the back; a long line of
busses snaking through the soybean fields, someone
telling us on the CB that this whole area had been
underwater three summers ago; lunch at Pere Marquette
Park (hearing McGwire hit #59 on someone's radio); the
thumbs up from pickup trucks as we drove down the
highway; Henry snapping pictures again as the busses
headed down the eastern shore of the Miss., under the
Palisades, snaking out for miles; the wonderful
conversation about the magazine and VW's in general as
Thomas listens intently from the back seat, pulling all
of it in; and finally Henry and I (his camera put away)
sighing and marvelling at the golden cables and
geometry of the bridge as we cross.  Going back to the
campground, I turned the CB off, and we rode in silence
through the heartland.
Two exhaustive posts here; and I haven't even gotten to
the evening^Åor the trip home.
