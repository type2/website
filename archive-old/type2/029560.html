Volks,

Tomorrow promises to be a *very* busy day :-)  I am taking the FI from my
'73 and the recharged battery from Alexandria (home base) up to Lancaster,
PA and will try to diagnose and fix the '78 I bought from Mark Kaylor.
The bus had/has some serious deficiencies and I would like to fix as many
as possible before I try running it for very long.  So... on the way htere
would love to pick up an engine seal and some 12mm FI hose clamps.  I know
Ron will have these, but he is more than a bit out of the way from
Alexandria to Lancaster (1.5-2 hours to the northeast, back roads all the 
way :-(  My current list of vendors along my path is:
Olympic Foreign Parts here in Alexandria,
Peek Performance in Odenton, MD.  
I know Olympic does not have the seal on hand, but I figure Peek will have
it (50/50 chance).  Alas, I *know* that neither has the 12mm clamps :-(

So my question is if there are any other VW FLAPS along my route.  That
is, up 95 to Baltimore, MD; up 83 to York, PA; then over 30 to Lancaster.

In addition, any Bays in yards along that path would be welcome.  There
are still some problems that will only be solved out of a yard (driver's
door handle and main wiring harness)

                           H Steven Dolan
