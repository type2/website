Subject: Mikey's '59 Single Progress

Well, my little '59 Singlecab is in green sealer.  All the body work 
is done, and it looks great!

Here I sit eating humble pie, as I was warned by Rusty van Bondo, et 
al., that my cost estimates were way too low (See archives &quot;Mikey 
gets schooled&quot;).  I had estimated, I believe it was like $600 for 
some quick body work, etc.  Well, about $1200 later the body work is 
done.  As I got into it, I got more anal about making sure it was 
done correctly and that meant more detail here and there.  I managed 
to cut off about $300 in doing some of the work myself (like wet-
sanding the whole thing.  YUCK.  It was no fun and I was so sore!)

I had planed to paint it pearl-white and green right away, but the guy 
who is doing the work doesn't have a booth, and its now too cold to 
paint.  

The local &quot;good&quot; body shop, after I approached them, were like &quot;Yuck, 
the INSIDE and outside of and old VW _AND_ you want two-tone... You'd 
have to give me $1000 plus paint just to spray it to get me to do 
it.&quot;  Is this guy MOTIVATED or what?  Where's Richard Simmons when 
you need him?

So my body guy put it in a green sealer for the winter.  

I'm still getting the gates all finished up, and then it's time to do 
the mechanical--The new engine/tranny and brakes and the rest of the 
hardware installed.  

My goal has been Halloween, and if the engine is forthcoming in the 
next two or three days, I should make it!  Woo-hoo!
