Subject: ridge at top of ring travel

I was reading the instructions that came with my new rings, and it says
to remove the ridge in the cylinder at the top of the ring travel or
risk messing up the new rings.  How do I do this?

I just ordered a craftsman honing tool to break the glaze on the
cylinders.  Will this be sufficient to drop that ridge down?

Thanks,
Mike
