Phil and All-


I guess I'm to blame for the acronym (or maybe
&quot;netcronym&quot;;-) of FART... A couple of months ago, I
half-jokingly wrote to the list about some annoying
thread that kept popping up (geez, I think it *was*
oil, now that I think of it!) and proposed calling
these items F.A.R.T.(s) for
&quot;Frequently-Annoying-Recurring-Threads&quot;. Get it? 

Well, I guess it stuck! It does kind of have ring to
it, so to speak ;-).


So now you know what it stands for and who to blame
for it's existance....me.


Happy Friday!


Jaime

&quot;So many FARTS; so little time&quot;

&gt; the glossary page under &quot;miscellany&quot; in the library
&gt; doesn't have an entry for
&gt; FART--wha' the heck *is* a FART anyhow?)
