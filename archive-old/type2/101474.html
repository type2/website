&gt;What you need to do is tight the nut down. I use a heavy hammer to pound the

You risk destroying the bearings with hammering. Get a 3/4&quot; drive crossbar 
and socket and a pipe cheater. No, I'm sorry, not cheap Chinese, but high 
spec. Calculate pounds/distance to set the torque at spec, then continue to 
the next hole. Same with the cotter key. Use the right size and quality 
pin. Stay away from the $9.95/1000 pin junk kits, for cotter pins or 
anything else. It can be hundreds of dollars cheaper to pay a $1 at the 
dealer for the proper spec cotter pin.


&gt;  The cotter pin holes are slightly offset so
&gt;when one gets covered, another opens. Pound until you really think it can't go
&gt;any further.

Yes, make certain the bearings dimple the races.


&gt;Then use a stainless-steel cotterpin that requires force to get
&gt;into the hole.
&gt;
&gt;If the metal is too soft and the pin is loose, the nut will work loose and
&gt;split the pin.

Nuts coming loose when torqued properly are an indication of bearing and/or 
spacer wear. How many times have you hammered it into submission????
