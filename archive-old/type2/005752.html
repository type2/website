Among other things &quot;Landon Hogue&quot; wrote thus:
 I found a nice little pool of water on my rear deck after another Seattle
&gt; rain.  The rear hatch seal is old, hardened, etc.

This is on another track.  You have a Riviera so this may not apply, but on
my Westy, the water that was on the back deck came through the holes the
luggage rack was mounted to.  Needed to seal them with new rubber washers.
