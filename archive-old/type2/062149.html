        Bob,
        They'll pry the keys of my single-cab from out of my cold, dead,
fingers. Unless I sell to One Of Us, of course. :^)
        I haven't read the complete text of the law- if you've got
a pointer to it or know the names of the bills I'd appreciate the pointer.

        I've got no rub with a pollution credit for getting a non-
catalyzed vehicle off the road. The CO I make at idle IS toxic. If
Snideley Whiplash convinces some chowderhead to part with their
all-original '48 Overland or 54 Barndoor, its a sad thing, but, as you 
observe, the vehicle may live again anyway. A state with fewer
'73 LTDs, 68 Caddys, and even rattle-trap VWs doesn't dismay me.

        I get magazine offers, second mortgage offers and a lot of
crap from the Republican Party that all looks like 'government' mailings-
I'd have 60 subscriptions to Newsweek if I judged by envelope alone! 
Truth in advertizing covers the case of offers to purchase old cars
for pollution credits, etc.

        Look, there have been dire predictions about smog controls since
PCV valves in the 60s. About 29 years later, I still don't see the problem.

        Bill
