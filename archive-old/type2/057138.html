Subject: HI!

Hi. Let me introduce myself.
I'm Laurie (or Larry) VanHoorn. I live in Melbourne,
Australia. I own a '77 Bus. It's not showroom, rather it's
more like a daily driver. It's ex- Australian Army, so
there's rubber mats, fixed vent windows, painted bumpers, no
clock, or even worse- NO HEATER! What it does have, however,
is $800 worth of stereo, new CVs, and a 2litre with a
Thunderbird exhaust.
I love it!
Laurie.
