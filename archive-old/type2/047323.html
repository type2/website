Really, you need two relays to wire it yourself...

they have instructions and a (poorly drawn) schematic at the library on
type2_dot_com...

or you could probably buy a commercial replacement...

you can use the headlight relays at auto-zone... the heavy duty grey ones
with 4 terminals...

take care,

p.s. we are back from our trip and safe, details to come once i remeber
