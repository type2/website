Subject: Turn signal lights on instrument cluster do not flash.

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C19063.F7900F20

Volks,


1970 Single Cab

I have been troubleshooting why the little green arrow=3Ds on my instrume=
nt cluster do not flash ..............I tested bulbs...good..............=
..old relay looked a little fried, and it appeared to be stock.....only o=
ne of the 2 clickers in it slicked, and when i manually clicked the other=
 with a screwdriver, the arrow on the cluster lit up...so I thought a new=
 relay would solve the prob.  =20

Externally, everything works fine.

Well, just got the new relay in from the bus depot, and it looks differen=
t, but had 4 posts.It had a p terminal (I figured must be KBL on my old o=
ne) and a 49 terminal which I figured must correlate to my 49+ on mine.  =
I hooked it up, same result.  Exterior works, interior nothing.  =20

What gives?
