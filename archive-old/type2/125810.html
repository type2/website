Subject: Bay windshield question (&amp; perhaps a free windshield for

REF:  Date: Sun, 11 Jul 2004 00:10:42 -0400
      From: &quot;David Bernstein&quot; &lt;bernie1_at_hhinternet_dot_com&gt;

.....I pulled out my original '70 bus windshield today in order to repair
the rust holes under the old rubber. Naturally it was worse than what I could
see from the front - but not so bad that I freaked....  If you know of a better 
price for a new windshield please post that for me.
Thanks David -Bernie-Bernstein


REPLY:  Bernie, I'm with you 100% on replacing the old glass with new.  My 
original 69 Bay is beginning to cloud-up.  A couple of years ago I was given a 
replacement, decent shape original Bay windshield, which I've kept in the 
garage.  It, too, is beginning to go foggy; so I don't think it will be worth 
installing when/if I fix the rust at the bottom of the windshield opening in 
the bodywork.  At that time I'll have two windshields to offer the list ;-))

I have had good success with old Beetles, when replacing windshields, to lube 
the opening with Dow Corning silicone (vacuum) grease.  It's completely inert 
and gives the paint some additional protection against the inevitable moisture 
contact... YMMV.

As to better pricing, I will be watching for good sources of 'new' glass.  
Count me as another interested reader.  Thanks to all,  Glenn
