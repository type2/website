Subject: Re: [T2] gluing instead of welding ?
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Gentlepersons-
                       I've gotten favorable responses from a few resto shops 
as regards
the duramix bonding products...But in all three responses, they were from 
profes-
sional shops. Butt joints are out of the question without a backer, of 
course. Also,
and I'm sure there are others, the new Morgan Aero-8, utilizes a glued 
together alum-
in(i)um chassis developed jointly with BMW. So, yes, it can be done. But I'd 
contact
the Co. for as much info as possible before attempting and commiting a great 
deal
of time, effort, and material to it.
