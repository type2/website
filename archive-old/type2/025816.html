&gt; 2. Any reason paper made shims can't be inserted between any 2 metal
&gt; ones to increase stack thickness?  (I remember, in the 71 I had, a paper
&gt; shim is used to bring out the flywheel, but it's fixed and doesn't
&gt; spin)-since crushed lazer paper is about 2 thou I could also bring out
&gt; the flywheel a hair and use the 4 lowest shims?)

Paper continues to get thinner the more you crush it. Printing presses use a
special paper called packing under the plates and blankets, and we did a
test once with our Akiyama Hi-Ace 428--we put a sheet of .010&quot; packing and a
sheet of .002&quot; packing on one blanket cylinder, ran it for a week, miked the
two sheets, changed the .002&quot; to thicker and thicker packing as needed to
keep the cylinder packed to .012&quot; (retaining the .010&quot; packing sheet, as it
was the test sheet), then miked the .010&quot; after two months. It was at .004.&quot;

Packing on a press is easy to change when it crushes too much. Packing on a
flywheel isn't.
