Greetings all,

I'm new to this list and I would like to introduce myself and also tell
you about my van which is for sale.

My name is Duncan Hume and I live in Somerset, in the South West of England.

My type 2 which is for sale is a 1979 panel van it has a new 2.0l Vege
engine
still under warranty. Also new carbs.

It is peppermint green and is totaly smooth at the front.
It is very low, but has hydraulic suspension which makes it great for 
daily use, as you don't get your teeth shaken out, unless you want to that
is!
The hydraulics were supplied by Max and it is a twin pump setup, 1 front and
1 rear. 

It has some fairly unique alloy wheels, with relatively new rubber. I also
have 2 brand new rear tyres to go with it.

Inside it has Leather front seats, and the back makes down into a bed,
although
there are no cushions. The dash is totally smooth with just a speedo behind
the 
steering wheel There is a rather nice pioneer stereo, subs, amps, cd etc.. 
Also a 12v-240v inverter so that you can run a small tv/video/playstation.

I am open to offers as I must sell, around $3800 with the stereo or £3000
without...

Pictures can be found here...
