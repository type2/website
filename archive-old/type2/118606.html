Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L Troubleshooting&gt;&gt;&gt;Solved

Thank you to all that responded to my dilemma.  Most all of you were accurate,
it started with a broken &quot;s&quot; tube, then the clincher was the AFM was
unplugged.  It was simply amazing how much better it ran with everything
connected.
A great weekend, 2- 2.0L FI projects running and ready for body work and
paint!!
Thank you list!!
