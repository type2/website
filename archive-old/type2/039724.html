&gt;No offence, kind philosopher, you are one of my favorites. Can you fix the
&gt;dwell on my Pertronix?
 
If you agree to the stated conditions and send your distributor to me, I
could take a shot at it. I could take it apart, clean, polish and lube the
mechanical advance for butter smooth function, replace the shaft bushings
if need be, take a tiny file to the various burrs present, confirm the
advance and adjust if required. If that makes things better, wonderful. If
not, pay me anyway. 

If you really want it fixed as a certainty, guaranteed, I could put a new
set of perfectly alinged and gapped Bosch points in there. 

Let me know if you want my shipping address.
