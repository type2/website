Subject: RE: replacing my brake servo...

&gt;The master cyliner has to be disconnected before removing the brake
servo right? 
No, Thet both can come off as a unit....

&gt;Anyone know what that hose on the front part of the brake servo is for
or what it goes to?

Supposedly a charcoal filter or something....

Good luck!!
