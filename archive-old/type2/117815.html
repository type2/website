Subject: Re: [T2] '78 &amp; '79 Deluxe Middle sliding windows

Richard,

Did mine with chrome and rubber from Wolfsburg west....

Once you get the chrome and rubber on the windows, you *must* measure
your openings and make sure it will really go.  I burned 3 seals getting
mine in on the drivers side....that is in the next couple of installments
on the restore of my 78 bus.

pmail if you need help/advice after measuring.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Does anyone out there have a '78 or '79 Deluxe Bus with the sliding windows
&gt; in the sliding door and opposite side?
&gt; I finally have a set to fit in my '77 Deluxe bus, but am unsure on what
&gt; window rubber to use?
&gt; All my current window rubbers have he chrome moulding inserted.
&gt; So should the rubber for the sliders have the moulding or not??
&gt; All the '78's and '79's I've seen are standard bus's (in Australia that
&gt; means no moulding in the window rubbers) and not Deluxes.
&gt; Thanks for your help.
