[...]
&gt; I have a 1972 Westie Campmobile with a rebuilt engine (rebuilt to 2.0L).
&gt; I think the engine is a 72 (ID # is CB 051435).  I've
&gt; had it timed several times by the same shop and the last time, I asked
them to
&gt; mark the timing position so that I could do my own timing.  When I saw
that
&gt; the mark showed timing to be 10 degrees before TDC, I was perplexed
because the
&gt; front counter guy at the shop said correct timing should be 5 degrees
after
&gt; TDC, which I verified in Muir's book.

Whoa, stop....
What is the distributor part # in your bus?
Is it a single vacuum advance unit or a dual unit?
A dual unit will time at 5 after IF you have manifold vacuum at the inner
nipple at idle. This will be dist. # 021 905 205S or 021 905 205AB or 022
905 205AB or 021 905 205AC or 022 905 205AC.
A single advance dist. will time at 7.5 before. This will be # 021 905 205P
or 022 905 205S.
Do NOT try to run a single advance distributor at 5 after.
You cannot go by engine number, you have to go by the distributor you have.
If you have a dual unit and it has manifold vacuum on the retard side at
idle and you have the timing set at 5 after.... disconnect the vacuum and
you will find your timing is now 7.5 before. [If you have # 021 905 205N,
you would set initial at 10 after because retard vacuum is 16-18 degrees,
still would be 7.5 before without vacuum]


&gt;
&gt; So I took it back yesterday just to have them verify the correct timing
and they
&gt; changed it to 5 degrees after TDC, telling me that the distributor is
stock so
&gt; this should be correct.

Stock for what??  Is it a dual vacuum unit?

&gt;
&gt; The bus then drove like s**t.
&gt;
&gt; I took it back today and asked them to look it over and they said again 5
degrees
&gt; after TDC was correct and that the Bus drove OK.. It did NOT drive ok.  I
had no
&gt; power in any of the gears, had a hard time getting to 50 mph and could not
&gt; maintain that speed on a hill.
&gt;

Get a 68-79 Bentley and go to section 5, pages 72 thru 75.....
