Subject: Re: 73 muffler install difficulty

Rodney,

I bought a new SS muffler from the BusDepot for my 83. I had to hammer on it
quite a bit on the top to get it to fit. I had the same problems that you
are describing fitting mine, so I just kept hammering and fitting till it
worked.

Use a big hammer.

but my nice new stainless steel stock type muffler doesn't want
&gt; to co-operate....if I try to go straight on, it hangs up on the studs, if
I
&gt; put one side on fully, the other side is about an inch or so too low...I
&gt; don't want to try to persuade it and break somthing...stupid questions,
but
