Subject: loose as a goose steering

I looked at a 68-70 bus the other day and the steering was VERY loose. You 
could turn the steering wheel about half the way around before it felt like 
it was moving anything. Noone was there, so I didnt go snooping under it, 
but im wondering what would cause it to be like that or what I should look 
for.

Looking down at the floor, it looked like the steering column was wiggling a 
little where it goes thru the floor. Not sure if that means anything or not.

Thanks,
David
