Subject: Trip pictures

Well, I have finally gotten *something* together with a very few of the
pictures I took on my trip.  The page I have assembled is at:

http://www.everybus_dot_com/trip/index.htm

The bus in the Loving county, TX section is a '76 in Mentone, TX.  I have
nbo idea of it's mechanical condition but it is stunning in its rust-free
body condition!  If I were any closer, I'd be hogging that pic 'til I
could get down there and get it myself :-)  I know nothing other than it
is in a lot with 20-30 others including a very complete Edsel!
