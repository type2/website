Hi Volks

I so difficult to work in the bus and attend the list too, that is why I have
been quite for a while, first of all thanks to everybody that helps me with my
sparks plugs tread problems, well I took the heads off and send them to the
machine shop to put the Helicoils, O.K,I know that some of you suggest to me
to stay away from them, but in my country this was the better option I could
find.
I have another question, tomorrow I will pick up a '58 Karmann Ghia I found,
the car have been sitting down for almost two years is a 1600 DP engine and
for sure is not stuck but who knows what I will discover, what kind of things
I have to look for when I will try to start it?.

Thanks from the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela

Roberto
