&gt; Can anybody tell me if the filler on a '69 is attached to
&gt; the tank via
&gt; rubber hoses? This is the filler that is still forward of

&gt; If everything is stock, then you should have a hose between
&gt; the filler and the tank.
&gt; Thank you!

OK, next question. How do I get to it to see if it is not cracked or
leaking? I suppose the hose is more or less straight and not bend like on
later ones (that have the round inspection lid in the engine compartment).

BTW, A lot of bad things have been said about Bus Boys in the past. Until
recently they never posted anything to the list. However over the last
several weeks I have seen several useful responses to various questions. I
would say that's an encouraging sign. Keep up the good work!
