&gt; Is there a trick I can employ the next time I change my '78 Bus' fuel

&gt; almost no gas left (or so I thought) but still wound up very gas covered 
&gt; and smelly. (Made for interesting conversation at work, tho.)  I'm sure 
&gt; the answer is a simple one, but then I'm not very mechanically inclined. 

I have put small angle cock type valves in my fuel line, crawl under, turn
angle cock and change filter, also works well for engine removal or theft
protection
