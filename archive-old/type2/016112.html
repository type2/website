Whoa, deja vu dude! 
I just bought all those parts and am planning on doing the same thing on
Saturday also. So I have a question as well. There is a special tool you need to
ream out the bushings and another to press out the old pin and push in the new.
Does anyone in the Seattle Washington area have these tools I can borrow for a
day or two? thanks
scott.

All,

Anybody have experience and useful suggestions or possible pitfalls 
regarding replacing the swing lever center pivot pin and bushing?  
How about adjusting/replacing the steering box?  I  have these parts 
and thought I'd at least replace the pivot pin and bushing tommorrow 
(Saturday).

Maybe I should mention that the ball joints and tie rods have just 
been replaced.  The steering still has a bit of slop and is hard to 
keep from weaving like I'm DWI at 50+ mph.

TIA
