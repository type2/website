James,

I agree with Bob on price.  You will end up spending $5000 or so for a 
bus by the time you're all said and done.  Also as stated earlier look 
for a bus from the south western part of the nation if you can.  Nothing 
ever rusted very fast there :-) .

Good luck shopping.

&gt;&gt;loaded question, but what could I expect to pay for a good running,
&gt;&gt;fairly reliable bus?   As has been my experience with other old vehicles,

&gt;
&gt;it has often been said that you will spend $5,000 either up front or in
&gt;getting it fixed up to be reasonably reliable.
