Subject: Re: [T2] Don't Crush

Hey all it would take is to cover a precentage of the roofs in America 
and we could replace most of the dirty coal fired plants...

Think about it: peak a/c usage is peak solar output. Obviously we aren't 
going to power our houses with solar only without a battery system but 
it is an assist concept. Think of all of the Wal-Marts and other 
shopping buildings with but flat hot roofs...

Hear many arguements for limited power sources - why not diversify? 
Economies of scale?

&quot;Don't Crush&quot; website idea: a place to post free come and get it cars 
(free only) so that the owner doesn't have to have them removed from 
their property and you and I can choose from free vehicles... Anybody 
want to start a website?

On the point of electrics: would fit ALOT of people's lifestyles but 
most of suburbia wants to buy one vehicle that can tackle the largest 
tasks a person can throw at it: towing boats (how many times a year?), 
haul the whole soccer team (again - how many times a year?), etc.

The better idea (to me) is to buy a nice expensive van or SUV (aka 
Eurovan) or sports wagon. Put it in the garage for trips and weekends 
(would last decades) and drive something efficient and used and maybe 
electric for their shoppping trips and back and forth to the office. NOT 
a golfcart as commonly depicted by the nay-sayers - but a real car like 
a Corolla sized car.

Yes, I know - wouldn't impress the co-workers like a new Mercedes or 
Dodge Ram turbo diesel.

Looked at a webpage of home-built electrics Friday. Cost of conversions 
was something like this: $600 for donor car, $5K for the conversion 
parts, $1000 for the batteries. Top speed = 60mph, range = 35 miles. 
Expensive project BUT still cheaper than buying a new car, and cheap to 
operate even considering the cost of the replacement batteries every 2 
years (the average frequency I saw on that webpage). Buy a simple donor 
car like 1980's VWs which was light and simple.

HOWEVER: look up the Telsa Electric Car. Think an electric Miata with 
REAL range. The auto makers can build usable electrics today. In 10 yrs 
more of building electrics they would be even better - consider 
batteries now and batteries 10 yrs ago.

Lastly: I think I ehard somewhere that federal law (or was it CA law) 
required car makers to supply spares for a certain period of time and 
warranty the drivetrain for a minimum number of miles. That last part is 
the problem: the batteries would wear out before the required warranty 
period and thus the carmaker would be required to replace them free.  
Expensive...

See ya!
