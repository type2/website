Subject: Re: Lucas-VW coil

&gt; I came across a 1600 DP bus engine sporting a Lucas ignition coil.  The coil
&gt; casing is aluminum and the flat end is stamped with a large VW symbol as
&gt; well as an &quot;043&quot; prefixed number that appears to be a Bosch part # (?).  The
&gt; plastic side of the coil has the Lucas name and in small print along its
&gt; rim, &quot;VW&quot; initials.  

I also had this setup on my '73 1600DP Beetle.  I think I still have it in
my garage if anyone's interested.. (replaced it with an Ultra-Kewell Blew
Coil.  Hey, I was 18.)  In my defense, I was very leery of keeping suspect
Brit parts on my bug.  Not that the Bosch stuff is all that much better.

&gt; Lucas provide VW approved replacment coils for VWs in the UK, or was this a
&gt; stock, factory part in certain countries?  

I seem to remember that someone told me that it may have been a
dealership-stock replacement part, and not nessecarily a &quot;Stock&quot; part, as
in &quot;from the factory&quot;.  But of course, these are but unsubstantiated
rumors.  Speculation, you see.

&gt;An archive search reveals a
&gt; mention of someone who had a Lucas coil on their VW, but VW markings on the
&gt; coil aren't mentioned.

That was me!  I was bored one day, asked the question.  Not much in the
way of replies, other than the aforementioned.  I am still interested.  My
Lucas-VW coil would be a much more interesting paperweight if I knew more
about it..  Dunno about the VW markings.  I'll look when I get home.
