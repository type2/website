Subject: Pushrod tube r and r

One more thing on this.

DO NOT PUT SEALANT ON THE O-RINGS.    This does nothing but make a huge
mess, and will lead to leaks.  Idiots do this.

Lubricate the seals  with oil or clear silicone LUBRICANT.  Get a long set
of needle nose pliers to twist the tube as you are installing.  Less likely
to cut a o ring on the head that way.
