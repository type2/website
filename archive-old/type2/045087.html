Subject: Re: [T2] Jack points

Jack points are available from several vendors.  If the floor pan is not
rusted through, Have a goor welder weld in the jack point for you.  As they
are all the same age, and have similar life experiences, check the other three
jack points also;&gt;).

Consider blockine the wheel on the ground diagonally opposite from the one you
are jacking up, next time.

Keep smiling,

Mike
