Hi Volks,

Just got in from the Great Canadian Bug Show, and had a good time there this
weekend. Although I didn't sell as many T-shirts as I had hoped, the designs
were well received... I should have had more XL size with me!

I posted a Panorama of one of the two lines of Buses at

If you are interested in my Type 2 Bay-window T-shirts, check out the images
at:

I'm not prepared to  go into major mail-order distribution at this point,
but I am interested in gauging the interest in BAY-WINDOW oriented art.
Please let me know if you like them off-list, greg-potts_at_home_dot_com

Happy trails,
