Subject: VW-DROP OFF IN POWER WHEN GOING UP HILLS
Date: Mon, 16 Nov 98 16:38:24 PST
From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

My '71 Bus (stock 1600 DP, 34PICT3, .009 cent dizzy) seems to have a new
quirk.  In the flatlands, everything is/seems fine: idles sounds good,
spark to all four, 120# or so in each cylinder, timing is on the money or
close enough (50 degrees of dwell at 850 rpm, about 29 BTDC at 3000 and
3400 RPM), engine runs at the usual temps, valves have been checked at
.006 a couple of times, etc.  Accelleration is within normal limits
(though that is difficult to measure) and it runs smooth at 55 or 60MPH.

The problem is that when I go up hills, it feels like I'm running on three
and a half cylinders.  I have to downshift a lot sooner than usual.  Now,
I know what a defective fuel pump feels like on hills (jarring losses of
power as if the gas is turned off and on) but this is much more subtle.
It is almost like I'm not able to give it the extra juice it needs (though
it has enough to continue running smoothly).  I also thought about vacc
losses but the line from the anti-backfire valve appears tight (it hisses
when disenganged after the engine is turned off) and the normal test of
spraying starting fluid on the manifold sleeves and head connections and
carb mounts don't produce any changes in RPM I can hear.  Plugs, wires,
and even the dizzy has been changed or swapped with new ones or different
types (.009 to a dual vacc advance) but the same tendencies are observed.

Could the accellerator cable have been stretched so that when I floor it
(the usual response to hills) it ain't enough to fully open the throttle?
Could there be something wrong in the carb's accell jet diaphram system?
It just seems like there ought to be something wrong in the fuel system
when the engine is put under stress.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.


Nick
