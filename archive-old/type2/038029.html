Subject: Cold Start Valve - question

My new (to me at least) 78 Westy is sitting out front like a log. Won't 
start - just turns over. I am hoping that someone can help answer a few
questions...

1) The PO clipped the 3 wires for the Cold Start Valve due to a crumbling
connector. I wish he would have left it's remains on, but could this cause
the engine not to start? How do I determine which wires should go where on
the new connector? My donor 78 has a crumbling connector here as well...

2) There were two extra wires coming from the pos. lead on the battery. One
is not connected at all (no trace of it anywhere), but the other was crimped
to a blue wire that goes into a loom over to the aux. battery. Does anyone
know what this one's for? I do not have it on my other 78.

3) There are two T1 connectors that aren't connected to anything right now.
They come out of the loom on the right side of the engine. What are these
for? My thought was they were for a CA engine as they are not on my donor.

4) Is there a source for new FI and engine wiring harnesses? It seems that
the PO had a fun time w/ it over the years and I really don't want to solder
all of 'em back together again.
