Subject: Re: commuting in the bus?

In one of the &quot;make your vehicle last forever&quot; books (I forget which one) 
there is an interesting rule of thumb: determine what payment you could 
comfortably make each month on a car, and spend that amount each month to 
maintain your &quot;forever&quot; vehicle. My guess is that the &quot;comfortable&quot; 
payment may be something less than what you are paying for your Honda.

This rule of thumb has a logic similar to the &quot;a bus is worth whatever
someone would pay for it&quot; (i.e.: market) logic. If you spend a comfortable
amount each month to maintain your bus, and it lets you down on your
commute repeatedly, you cannot afford to maintain it. 

But I will bet that at an average monthly expense to maintain the bus of 
$150-$200 a month ($1800-2400 a year) your bus will be reliable, fun, and 
look darn nice. And maybe you will run out of things to fix!

But what do others think? Is $2400 a year enough to maintain a bus that 
is driven every day?
