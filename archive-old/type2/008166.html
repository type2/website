&gt; Also found, at the same junkyard, a Vanagon with *mint* front seats.

horse
&gt; hair, I thought.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Before I splurge, does anyone out there have experience with
installing
&gt; vanagon seats in a early 70's loaf?  Looked in the archives but
couldn't
&gt; find much.  The rails didn't seem to be the same, so before I go
&gt; tearin', I'd appreciate any hints or warnings.

Before you go adapting other seats into your bus, I suggest that you
consider rebuilding the ones you have.  You can get original-style
seat upholstery already pre-sewn and re-pad the springs with foam, 
The result is good-as-new seats with all the original hardware in
place.  This would probably cost less than the Vanagon seats.

I've seen other seats adapted into buses.  The seat proportions of
other vehicles often doesn't suit early bays with their very upright
seating postion and with the partition behind the seat.  The Vanagon
seats would probably be better than most, but as I recall, V-gons
don't have partitions behind the seats.  The partitions might force
the seat to be too far forward.
