Subject: Free Tucson Show Help  Please

Magoo and I HOPE to make the Tucson show this Saturday--I am still VERY WEAK
Melissa does NOT want us to go  but hopefully we will--What we need is
someone to help us unload our swap meet stuff should only take about 15
Minutes--we will be leaving Phoenix around 5AM and towing Herbie  IF anyone
can help that would be VWonderfull   perhaps at the close of the show help
Magoo to load the van--  Please, Hopefully, uj
