Subject: Re: [T2] FI problem, engine starts, runs for a minute, dies.

Eddie,

Put a fuel pressure gauge on it....sounds like an obstruction of some sort 
in the fuel line....been there, done that.  Actually, I did it a lot with my 78 
that had sat for 8 years....I could drive 4.5 miles and then die.




Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello List.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently rebuilt my 1800cc Fuel Injected type4. It fired right up on the
&gt; first attempt and ran for a good 5 minutes until i shut it down. Since
&gt; then, I haven't been able to get it to run for more than a few minutes. 
&gt; 
&gt; It will run great, throttle works perfect, then it will just die,
&gt; seemingly no matter how much gas im giving it. It will do it at idle and
&gt; also has done it around 2000rpms. Just dies, just like you switch the key
&gt; off. When restarting somtimes it starts right up and runs for like 30
&gt; seconds and does it again, others it just fires for a few revs (fast) and
&gt; dies again.
&gt; 
&gt; My first idea was that the problem was a vaccum leak. I clamped down some
&gt; vacuum lines that are common problems. In doing so, I noticed a that the
&gt; #2 injector was leaking, both at the connection to the fuel rail  and the
&gt; connector to the injector (that little tube inbetween). This is something
&gt; i plan to fix immedeately, but I'm not sure that its related.
&gt; Could it be? Othewise the
&gt; vacuum system looks good, no obvious leaks and the brake booster is not
&gt; connected. However, I haven't done the starter fluid check ( i don't like
&gt; doing that). 
&gt; 
&gt; My guess is that something (like the aux air) is shutting off air to the
&gt; engine when its not supposed to. I checked the troubleshoot manual for
&gt; L-jet but didn't really help, so i look to the list for advise. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
