Subject: Re: [T2] engine number confusion

I'm glad I raised this topic.  I wish I knew what the definitive answer 
was!  Now I wonder where multiple people got the same information from 
regarding GE engines being california only that is posted in the type II 
library if it's not correct.  This is interesting!  Greg

&gt;Hi Everyone,

&gt;         I agree concerning GE numbers. I have a '78 with original GE
&gt;motor, not a california, bought new in Virginia. Hydraulic lifters were
&gt;supose to have come out in 78 but I have seen a late '76 GD engine with
&gt;hydraulic lifters supposedly original? I don't know.
