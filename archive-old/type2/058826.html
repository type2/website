Subject: Re:  carb cfm and engine displacement?

&gt;I will be putting my Holley Bugsprays on my 1915cc engine soon, but am
&gt;thoroughly confused about cfm required for this engine. According to
&gt;Holley's carb book, Mike Wests cfm formula, and CB Performance data, a
&gt;1915 running at 5000rpm requires 180cfm. These Holleys each put out
&gt;300cfm! It would appear I have way too much carburetion, yet they have
&gt;only 29mm venturis. I know the popular centre mount Holley 5200 puts out
&gt;270cfm. 
&gt;
&gt;What comparable cfm do the Webers/Dells put out? Fisher shows the dual
&gt;Holley Bugspray 300cfms in his book &quot;How to HotRod VW Engines&quot; on a 1641
&gt;using an Engle 110 cam, and he said it ran great,just a few HP below dual
&gt;Webers. 
&gt;
&gt;Obviously I need some carb gurus to explain why there is such a
&gt;discrepency between the formula giving 180cfm and the 600cfm of the
&gt;Holleys. 
&gt;
&gt;Many thanks,
&gt;Courtney

  The problem is one that will always be with us in some respects. .

 Example: Berg (name-dropper!) spoke in one of his articles of putting
a 45 or 55mm Weber on a single port 1300 . . . don't quote me the 
details, it's been a long time since I read it . .

 The point is how can he throw this big ass carb on that little engine
and succeed?   The Venturi was properly sized . . and jets

 It might be a 600cfm rated carb but with a small venturi it's pulling
around 100cfm.

 If I had some of the carb books, I might whip up a formula for venturi size
. . it would be based on their charts which list empirical data they have
recorded for their carbs . .

 Here's my view of what is needed: a venturi small enough to give me
a good idle . . and still be big enough to give me my top end at 
seventy-leven thousand rpm . . this is a balance act . .

It doesn't work so well which is why a racer doesn't idle well and led
to the invention of the &quot;dual, progressive&quot; carb . . actually has 
two throats or venturi, one for low rpm and one for high . .

You can see this gets real complex but don't like complex so we make
it simple . . this is already out there in posts  . .

 We look at this thing as a self-propelled air-compressor . .

 We look at the &quot;stock air pump&quot; . . got 35.5  intakes and 32 exhaust.
Talking about the valves there . . 
So we want to suck the most fuel/air in there we can and still get it
burned . . we need enough vacuum to boil the gas too . . vaporize . .

 Keeping with the &quot;simple&quot;, the stock 34 PICT-X carb has a 26mm venturi . .
cooooooooo !  !  what's going on? all these sizes . .

 So we got the 35.5 and the 32 and the 26mm  . . . . you see the 
connection, right? . . . . :-)

 As I recall . . size the venturi to your intakes, a proportion of
same . . looking at the 35.5 intake and the 26mm venturi of stock carb, we
come up with 73%  . . . that's to make the vacuum with. . 

 That's a stock number . . race engines may run as much as 125% of
volume but that's all in a different world . .

I have another post out there somewhere that refers to that . .

Now if you maintain that ratio on your new engine, it should run about
like the stock as far as idle is concerned . .

You can probably go on up to about 85% without too much problem. .

Going back to the valves again, the exhaust is only 32mm . .
what's up with that?  . . . 

 While it's a lot more complex than I make it here, the restriction
is there to give you good mileage . . too big exhaust valves just
blow the fuel out the stack . .

 The 32 to the 35.5mm valve is a 90% ratio . . . 
I mention it only because there wouldn't be much point in putting a carb on
that had bigger venturi than the exhaust valves . .or the exhaust pipe for
that matter . . .

Which means the average farmer can go pull a carb off the old pickup
out there and walk over to the tractor and match that hole thru with
the size of the exhaust pipe of the tractor and conclude &quot; that'll
do it&quot; and proceed to mortise that pig on there. 

What about the jets?! you cry . . . well multiply the venturi size by
4 and that's your jet size . . . there's another post out there on that. . . .

Now a word about my own CFM post of &quot;old&quot; . . I deliberately said in 
it that you could use &quot;one carb for this size engine or half that if
you used two carbs&quot; . .  that is wrong but nobody was listening . .

 You have to use a pair of 40's or a single 40 for example .. no half-
size . . the deal here is that the carb is only working half the time
if you have duals . . 

 well  . . that's enough of this stuff . . :-)
