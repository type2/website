Subject: Replacing Brake lines
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com


Just wondering if anyone has replaced the brake lines on a bay window bus and 
can comment on how they did it and what parts and tools are needed.  
Inspecting the brakes on my '73 Panel, I noticed they are pretty rusty 
looking.  Stainless steel line and fittings would be ideal.  btw, the '73 has 
mechanical brakes with no booster.
