&gt; well, i reattached the wires to my horn last night,

The little black button just pries off with a screw
driver.  My van's horn was still unreliable after my
half hearted repair so I got the loudest set of horns
that Harbor Frieght sold and just bolted them on and
made a new circuit with a push button on the dash. 
It's not the authentic VW sound, but 125 dB of power. 
I think it gets more attention in the circumstances
that a horn needs to be honked anyway.
