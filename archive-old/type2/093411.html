&gt;the supplier you listed has a note on his VDO head temp guages on 
&gt;availablility,   suggest ordering asap as i have posted a note in RAMVA 
&gt;about problems trying to find a head temp gauge for my westy.
=====================&gt;
My CHT was ordered today and is in stock.
I am just waiting until tomorrow to get back with him so as to allow time 
to draw up a line item listing of costs, etc. to work against on the 
shipment and invoice.
Also, I wanted to think about this pod configuration thing.
here is the pod:

I'm pretty excited about being fully gauged on my bus.
