&gt; Re the lack of go and fuel exhaust fumes.  Just on an outside chance make sure that you haven't been visited by mice or squirrels during your lay-up.  I've had remarkable amounts of nesting materials accumulate in the strangest places while storing for long periods until I learned to plug them.  Check to make sure your intake and exhaust systems are free of nest debris.  I've found nests in the air cleaner box and in the muffler.  

good point, I had a fire in a heat duct caused by nest materiels catching
fire, (easily extinguished) it was in my spare engine that had been stored
for a while.
