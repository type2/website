Subject: Re:70 poptop

--=====================_889472414==_

i'm currently in the NW, up in Oregon..but i'm gettin ready to move back to the midwest in Iowa, the middle of june. WestVirginia is a long way from there...but who know's with my travels;) 
thanks for the info, i'll get back to ya, if that ever becomes a possibility. *shine on* -Chris 

any more help with a heads up on abandonded 70poptops out there, will definately be appreciated. and like i said within my post here, i'm gettin ready to go from the Westcoast&gt;Midwest. so anything here, there, or any of the points inbetween, would be best. but i'm sure other means could come up also. thanks.
