Oh man I should have never started this, Joel's degraded to puns
as bad as the old days.

Here's another speed related funny though, tooling down a winding
steep raod on plant today and ZOOOOOMMM, up behind me the '97
Corvette.  (As a side when the defense industry went to poop
in the 80's our rocket motor plant opened a sideline doing automobile
road testing on the varied roads of WV, something like 30 million
miles in various cars, we are like the most respected in the world, MBZ,
japs) And the new vette, all mocked up with these canvas covers and
stuff on front and rear.  So I make this poor test driver in the
vette follow me down the hill a a painfully slow speed, laughing all
the way, see if his Cd helped him then.
