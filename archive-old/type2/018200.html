Subject: 'Tanks' to Hoover!
Message-ID: &lt;374C8E68.1D4DCDC_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

There were numerous threads about cleaning greasy parts, TSP, etc.  Bob
Hoover shared his wisdom about degreasing, some heat (bbq) and a tank to
put everything in.  I had previously found his comments in an old sermon
and had implemented same.  I just came in from the barbeque and have to
relate some of my success.

I found an oval (12&quot; x 24&quot;) galvanized tank that fits inside my gas
barbeque and some water and TSP (Home Depot item and REAL cheap) and
I've been degreasing like mad.  Cylinder tin, rockers, bolts, you name
it.  Its quite nice to be putting this stuff back together without the
gunk.  My transmission mount bracket came out absolutely shiny.  Just a
few pieces of stuck on paint, but mostly down to bare metal.  The double
cab gate latches, right down to bare metal.

I just set the parts in the tank, fill with water, put the TSP in
(coupla handfuls) and boil away.  The hardest part about the whole
system is to remember that I've got stuff cleaning and go out and turn
the BBQ off.

I pull the parts out with an old BBQ tongs, set them aside and then
rinse off.

As far as the remainder, I have been allowing the water to evaporate
(distillation) and am left with oily sludge.  The sludge is being pored
into a container and when the container is full, I'll take it to the
local oil disposal place.

It may not be fancy, but its very cheap, easy, efficient and my parts
have never been so clean.

'Tanks' for another great idea, Bob.
