 I removed the connecting rod.  one of the

 the crank and the connecting rod, and is
 doubled up with the other bearing half.
 removed the bearing halves.  they were
 stuck pretty good.
 
 I have a spare 1600.  I pulled one of the
 connecting rods off it.  311b is how it
 is marked.  The same marking as the
 rod that had a bearing go bad.
 
 put the &quot;new&quot; one in, and it has too much
 play.  in and out (direction of piston travel)
 a few thousandths.  side to side (front/ rear
 of engine) has more play than the others.
 
 I guess the bearing in the &quot;new&quot; rod isn't
 thick enough?
 
----------------------------------------------------

The term for what happened is &quot;you spun a bearing&quot;.

This happens when the journal surface is worn away and
you have too much clearance between the journal and
the bearing.

The crankshaft will have to be removed and machined to
the next repair size.....  if it is not past the last
repair stage.....
