Hey,

Does anyone have a good automatic transmission
to sell?  Or know who might have one?

My wife won't drive my '68 with the manual and
as the bus has historically been our 'touring' bus
I would just as soon let her drive for a while.

I have heard rumors about different autos from
VW used in the Bus.....

Any ideas?
