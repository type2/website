Subject: Re: [T2] '72 distributor in a '68

Okay, thank Karl, I had no idea. I've been reading these postings on type 2 
for years, and somehow managed to get the impression that some type 4 
dizzies would go up to 45 degrees total advance with vacuum factored in, and 
an 009 with 22 degrees of advance was grossly inadequate for them.

My new Mexican single vacuum advance Bosch distributor times about 7 BTDC at 
idle and about 28-30 at full advance. I guess some of the double advance 
distributors had a lot more advance, I never use those myself so have little 
experience with them. 9 times out of 10, when I look at someone's engine 
with those distributors on them, they have the vacuum hoses hooked up 
backwards and won't listen to reason.

I stand by the setting the engine at full advance of 28-30, it allows for 
whatever the distributor advances, be it 22 or 45.

From Tom and Thanh:

&gt; Some type 4 distributors had way too much advance for a type 1 engine.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have seen this mentioned before and I have never figured out where this 
urban legend came from.


Hmmm, the type 1 SVDA was 35.5 to 44.5. Again the type 1 dist has MORE total 
advance.
