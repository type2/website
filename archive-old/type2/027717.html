Subject: Re:  re-upholstering the front seats on a 1970: seven observations 

Hi Volks,
   I'd like to second everything Bill said about recovering the seats.  Like 
him, I got lucky on putting the proper cover on the seat I was doing at the 
time.  I would disagree on TMI's instructions.  I got the one sheet of 
instructions and found that to be enough.  Yesterday I did the passenger 
seat and tomorrow I'm gonna do the driver's seat in our 71.  I didn't have 
any broken springs in my first seat, but time will tell about the driver's 
seat.
   It sure looks nice.  I can't wait to do the other seat and the matching 
door panels.
