Subject: fuel pump for '69

&gt;       Many conservative persons recomend NOT having a filter between
&gt; the pump and carb. They suggest filter on the output of the tank only.
&gt; MANY vw persons such as myself have a filter between the pump and carb.
&gt;       Problem is wieght of filter, over time, may pull brass hose-barb
&gt; from carb body, big fuel leak, fire, etc.

Call me bel and suspenders, but I've got 2... one before the pump, one before
the carbs. Take two! They're cheap!
