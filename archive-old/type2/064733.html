I too, prefer to shift for myself.  You message prompted me to post a question that I had been considering:  namely, how do those  &quot;quick shift&quot; or short throw shift thingies work?
Or maybe I should say &quot;do they work?&quot; I've seen them in several catalogs for 6 or 7 dollars &amp; I've been considering one for my  '77 Westfalia. My wife has a hard time reaching the gears, &amp; I think one would help.         Any thoughts, complaints, experiences?&quot;BREAK OUT THE CIGARS!!  THIS LIFE IS FOR SQUIRRELS!!!   WE'RE OFF TO THE DRUGSTORE TO WHISTLE AT GIRLS!!!! &quot;      ---WALT KELLY
