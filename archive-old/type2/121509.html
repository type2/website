Subject: Re: [T2] painting tin

&gt;The tin doesn't get anywhere near these temps, so ordinary rattle-can
&gt;paint is fine.  I use Krylon or Rustoleum (whichever is cheaper at the
&gt;time) in gloss black and it lasts for years.

And wet sanding with a bit of soap in the water seems to make all the 
difference for me...

Wipe down with lacquer thinner. Dry. Spray several light coats of rattle 
paint. Bake in summer sun. My tin paint has lasted quite a while too...

Prep is everything. I was told that long ago but never made the effort in 
my younger years.
