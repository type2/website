FWIW, if you want to rule out the alternator, which is a common source of
whining noises in the engine compartment, remove the belt and fire up the
engine for a quick test to see if the noise goes away.

Subject: [T2] distributor noise


&gt; Greetings,
&gt;
&gt; Mine is an air-cooled 81 Vanagon, FI, points and condensor, and I am
&gt; hoping someone might be able to give me a clue to finding the source of an
&gt; ugly noise.
&gt;
&gt; I just noticed a loud whining coming from, as near as I can tell, the
&gt; distributor.
(snip)

 Any other ideas what might cause the loud whining?
