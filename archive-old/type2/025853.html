&gt; As a new, very new owner, what is everyones opinion on body filler?

It shouldn't be more than a quarter-inch deep; Edelstein came with a
inch-thick puddle of Bondo on one of her cab doors. With a crack right in
the middle of it. Lots of tender massaging (and a few brute force
techniques, like prying it with a crowbar and heat-shrinking it with a
rosebud heating tip on an oxyacetylene torch and a damp sponge) has returned
it to its original shape.
