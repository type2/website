A friend of mine needs some cash for Christmas gifts for his 
kids and asked me to post a few items he has for sale...

211-501-265C Rear Stub Axels for '71-up buses $50/each (has 2)

211-953-513E Turnsignal Switch for '66-67 buses $75

Prices do not include shipping, but they are small items and 
shipping would be cheap.  You can call Allen at (770) 943-3491 
or I can make arrangements for you via email.

Dave
