Subject: Re: [T2] Temp Gauge and various q's

&gt; supposed to &quot;bend&quot; the sender out of the way of the gen pulley?  This is a
&gt; dip stick sender I am referring to, it is touching.

Yes you can bend the dipstick sender.
If you bend it too much back and forth you can crack it mostly its just a
hollow brass tube with a thin blue wire inside.
how do I know this?
I broke a fanbelt and it in turn bent my sender so that it cracked a few
inches above where it enters the tube.
I cut it shorter and resolered the connectors and it works fine, actually
better because it is short enough to stay out of the way.
the 2 connectors on top, 1 solders to the tube (ground). amd 1 solders to
the little wire running up the tube from the thermocouple.
