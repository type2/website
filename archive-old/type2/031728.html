haven't tried it yet, but when they did the roof of my house they used
this new rubber materiel that is melted with a torch on one surface then
placed on whatever surface and it bonds with the surface...there was about
a half roll of the stuff left over from the job and it is sitting in my
garage waiting for me to get the nerve to try it.
