Well, at least yours lasted 2 months. I replaced CV boots on Dec 23, 2005.
They didnt make it a month. I strongly suspect the reason is that I
followed some advice to put extra grease in the boot. That was a mistake.
I'm 99 44/100% sure this was the reason for the failure because it appears
the rubber separated cleanly where the rubber meets the metal cap where
the bolts go through. Live and learn... :-(
