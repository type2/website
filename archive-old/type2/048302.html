Subject: [T2] the good news its not water or oil in the cylinder..now the bad news

I have no idea what is wrong. i pulled the heads yesterday and found my
cylinders in immaculate condition...so that rules out the oil/fuel/water
flooding idea. back to the subject of starters...what is a &quot;hot start&quot; what
is the importance of a starter relay in combination with the solenoid? can a
starter turn an engine over quickly on the compression stroke but when it
comes to the top of the stroke can it stall out and just not have enough
juice to push it on through the compression stroke? I'm trying
everything..._dot_can the mechanical oil pump get clogged enough to bog down the
engine rotation....should I open the pump or no? any incite would be
appreciated, thanks!
