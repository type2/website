Subject: Re: [T2] Braking problem update

From Peter Pankonin:

Quite a while back I asked about a braking problem I was having, where after about 10 minutes of driving the 
brakes would have slowly applied enough for me to really notice the drag. I would have to shut off the engine 
to release the vacuum in the brake booster servo, and then it would be fine for another ten minutes or so.

Someone suggested liquid in the brake booster servo. I also noticed that brake fluid was dissappearing fairly 
quickly. Well...it was in the brake servo. I guess there's a seal that needs replacing.

 Rather than pull the whole thing apart I decided to just disconnect and cap
 the vacuum line to the booster and use the brakes the old-fashioned way.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The seal you need to replace is the complete master cylinder. The brake fluid is draining into the booster. 
Your booster is filling up with brake fluid.

Now you also need to replace the booster also. Too much brake fluid in it destroys the valves in it.

With or without vacuum, your bus is unsafe to drive NOW.
