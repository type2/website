Subject: Re: Have I got hydraulic valves?
Mime-Version: 1.0


To Jim O'Reilly + list:
Well, easiest way to tell if hydraulic would be to ask rebuilder what went
in there- yes 79 should have hydraulics-
On a bus with unknown history I'd pull valve covers
pronto and do the valve adjustment check (#1 at TDC, wiggle the rockers)-
both tight and/or have wierd spongy feel? Then it's likely hydraulics.
Nonhydraulics won't feel spongy ever when you really pull on the rocker
top, and should have a gap.  Hydraulics are adjusted to two turns in after
contact with the valve.  If you have reason to pull the pushrod tubes to do
a leaky seal, one can reach in there with a magnet or even the handle end
of a broken chainsaw file (3&quot; long- stick it in the hold in the center,
push sideways, and pull) and the lifter will come out if hydraulic.  MB
