Subject: RE: [T2] Troy's engine problem of the day.....

All the valves are moving while the engine is being cranked.  No vacuum
hoses are disconnected or misplaced.  Valves are adjusted as per Bentley
but with only 1 turn in after contact.

When it was cranking this morning, it would turn over at about 20rpm's
but then it would bind.  Like the engine was real real tight.  No bad
sounds or anything though.  Keep the key turned and eventually it would
get past it and crank at 20 again.

Hi Troy,

Have a look at the other valves, and make sure all the valves are 
moving. If not you could have a busted camshaft.

Other than that, I don't know what to suggest.

&lt;/Greg&gt;
