Subject: Re: [T2] high beams '71 - dimmer relay?

&gt; Greetings:
&gt; I have had ongoing problems with my 71. For some time, the high beams had
&gt; been stuck on the high (bright) position. Previously, the problem had been
&gt; the turn signal switch. After disassembling, I noticed that the wire
&gt; controling the power to the relay was no longer attached. I resoldered the
&gt; wire back in its proper place. (I had another assembl'y that I could use as
&gt; a pattern.) Now I could hear the clicking that you should hear when pulling
&gt; on the turn signal lever to turn on the brights, which I didn't hear before.

Sounds like your relay needs to be replaced.  Often the relays die if
there is a minor windshield leak and the relay (being mounted top-down)
fills with water.

Unfortunately, the '71 relay isn't available any more.  You will get one
with an additional terminal.  Here's a post I made some time ago about
this:

-----------------------------
The 4-pin 411-941-583C relay is no longer available (at
least locally)  Web searches revealed only one source, a Porsche supplier.

Luckily, I have a fairly savvy parts guy and he pulled out a 111-941-583
5-pin relay to compare.  The extra pin (#30) is supposed to be attached to
a hot wire to energize the relay coil.  In the old relay the coil  was
attached internally to pin 56 which
is the voltage source supplied from the headlight switch.

Apparently, the idea of the 5-pin relay was to allow the beams to be
switched with the
headlights off by supplying the relay with power from the ignition
circuit.

I soldered a jumper between the #30 and #56 pins and plugged the relay in.
There was a hole in the fuse block to accept the #30 pin, but no connector
inside the hole.  The modified relay worked perfectly.
--------------------------------

Also, before installing the new relay, drill a small hole in the top of
the case.  This allows water to drain out of the case when the relay is
installed upside down.  I'm paranoid, so I also made a plastic cap that
covers the fuse block and relays to prevent water from sitting on it.
