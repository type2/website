Subject: '76 2.0l FI Compression Question
In-Reply-To: &lt;199903112241.RAA00437_at_rotary.type2_dot_com&gt;

I apoligize for the redundancy, but the archives left me confused.
I am looking at a '76 Westy  w/ 2 liter Fuel injected.  It has 
83k original in the original engine.  This appears to be true.
I ran a pre-purchase compression check as follows, and and I 
am curious as to what my findings mean.  I warmed up the engine
for a good 10min. Pulled the plugs: they were black, but the 
porcelain was brown.  Did six cranks on each cylinder.
The results in order were: #3:110,#4:120,#1:116,#2:120.
#3 seems to be the low baller, but what kind of shape am I in?
I am assuming a valve job and tune up may clean this up a bit.
Any thoughts?  Should I steer clear of an 83k original motor?
I feel like I might be ok if I drive tune it and drive it properly.
Btw, I didn't have time for a 'wet' test.

Thanks: Chris Binder Milwaukee, WI - 71 ghia coupe fs

As a side note, my ghia motor 1600dp ran 140 all around w/ #3 at like
40, oil squirt did not raise it.  Is this a valve problem or a basket
case?
