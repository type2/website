Subject: Using Leistritz/Ernst exhaust w/Dual Carbs, maybe 1776cc?

Hello List!

Help! I really need some (more) good advice!!

The 1600dp in my '71 Westy is getting very smoky.. I
have dual Weber ICT34 carbs, 009, extractor exhaust,
thru good (Danish) heat exchangers, but have NO heat
hooked up. The motor was last rebuilt (cheaply, by me,
pistons/cylinders) in 1991, but now I'm thinking about
going 1776cc.. Good idea?? 

Is anyone getting heat when using an extractor
exhaust? I have the boxes in, but no hoses connected
(tennis balls plugging fan shroud holes!) and don't
see how you could run hoses with the exhaust manifold
pipes blocking the holes thru the tin..

Winter's coming and I'm in Boston MA, my bus is my
only transport!! Can a standard exhaust (with those
small extra heat boxes) be used with dual carbs, maybe
even with a 1776cc, with okay performance??

What are the pros and cons, 1600 or 1776?? TIA!
