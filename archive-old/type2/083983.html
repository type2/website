Subject: Re: [T2] A few questions...

Do you lift the front of the bus?  The rear lifted that high means the
angle of the trans is quite different from that of the rolling engine,
so you could have interference with clutch release and the trans-shaft. 
If alone, it's hard to move the engine down as you insert!  On an early
bus, you can let down the trans so it's parallel to the ground when
pulling/inserting engine.

&gt; I use a set of ramps to pull my engine. It gives me tons of room to pull
&gt; my engine .  I have a cart I put the engine on and when I am ready to
&gt; lift the motor into place I slid the jack  under  the cart. I then lift
&gt; engine and cart with no problem. If your bus is not running jack up one
&gt; side of the bus and slide the ramp under the tire and then do the other
&gt; side the same way.
