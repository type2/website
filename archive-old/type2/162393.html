&gt; A friend is moveing back to WI and she wants to bring her bus with her. What
&gt; is the best way. I was thinking a uhual tow dolly with the drive shafts off.

depends a lot on what she is towing it with, a bus is pretty heavy for
it's size.  and I would bet that she would fill it up with &quot;Stuff&quot; for the
move.  she also needs to cross the mountains something that will put a
strain on both the tow vehicles engine and on the brakes.  personally I
would rent a BIG U-haul truck and a large trailer that could carry the
bus.  fill the truck up with as much weight as possible and bite the
bullet and pay the rental.

&gt; How will the tires hold up? Anyother Ideals or ways.

they will hold up about as well as they would driving it there, if you
wouldn't drive it on those tires, don't tow it.

of course she could always drive the bus there and spend the money for the
tow on the bus..
