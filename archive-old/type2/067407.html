Ben Pon (St. Pon?), the Dutch importer, is generally given credit for the 
idea of the VW Transporter.  It supposedly was inspired by the &quot;shuttle 
craft&quot; used in the factory to run parts around.  Basically a Beetle pan 
with the driver sitting over the wheels (but I can't remember if it was 
the front or back wheels).
