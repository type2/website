Here it is.  I've been trying, patiently to get my 78 2.0L F.I. running.  Ive checked the FI, and I've got feul(this probably sounds fimilar, I checked the spark and I have spark, replaced the coil and a number of things including the combi relay.  I've determined that I have a hard spot in the motor.  I did a compression test, they were all good.  But the motor does have a hard spot, the starter slows to almost a stop.  I removed my valve cover and discovered that they are dry, NO OIL... What could be wrong???  Should I remove the engine and do a rebuild??  This would be my first rebuild, is it do-able for a first timer??  Please help..Thanks Mike
