Hi,

    Just re-entered Westy world and picked up a 78 Westfalia with auto
trans. Needs work but I'm game. The question I have is regarding the auto
transmission. It leaks, though shifts pretty smoothly, clunks a bit when put
in reverse but great on the road. The leak occurrs both while driving and
parked. It's been sitting for a couple of weeks while I tend to other parts
of it and a fair sized pool has accumulated beneath it. On inspecting it
while running I noticed that the fluid appears to be dribbling down the side
of the govenor housing. Hopefully this is the only source.

    I've called several local dealers and transmission joints and they seem
to offer gaskets and kits of various sorts, and prices, (some mighty big
prices). My inclination is to simply replace this gasket or seal (haven't
taken it off yet), and closely monitor fluid consumption afterwards. Anybody
with an over-my-shoulder suggestion would be appreciated.


    Thanks
