Subject: Road Trip Sleeping Places

I have to throw in some gems of wisdom gleaned from my cross country
exploits...

First, National Forst Service campgrounds are the *best*!  and with a
little planning, they can usually be found close to a day's drive apart.
The fee is seldom more than $10, and many times they are free.

WallyWorld is always a decent emergency place to stop, but as others have
mentioned... light-tight curtains are a must!

Rest areas...  vary highly by state.  Also, there is a huge divide between
east of the Appalachians and the rest of the US.  I would not sleep in a
rest area east of the Appalachians.  The I-95 corridor is just *too*
crowded :-(  West of the Appalachians.. fine.  And maybe even off I-95.  I
tend to read the signs and leave the poptop down.  I have only ever been
bothered in PA, VA, and OH (don't ask about how much I love Ohio)

Truck stops... have always been way too noisy for me, but I have slept
there if I had to.

Local parking/camping areas...  If you have a road atlas, and you oughta,
look for the tent symbols.  There are some really neat local and State
parks with camping.  My usual procedure is to drive to the closest exit,
get off and throw myself on the mercy of the gas station attendant.  they
are usually teens and know *all* the good places to park :-)  The
pheremone count may be a bit high, but... :-)

OH... and along 101 in California... any pull-out is fine as I understand
and one of these years I want to schedule a 6 month trip to awaken in each
of them! :-)

If you are falling asleep behind the wheel, pull over...  nap!  even on
the Interstate, the cop who pulls up behind you will be happier to awaken
you and chase you down the road than scrape you off the guard rail.  Exit
and entrance ramps are better, especially in the west, but if I have
pressed too far, I have pulled off in many an odd spot.  I have gotten a
couple of &quot;stern talkings to&quot;, but no tickets.
