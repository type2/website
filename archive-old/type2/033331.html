+AD4-Hi+ACE-
+AD4-
+AD4-Can someone tell me how to mount the spare wheel at the front of my bus?

You will need to get a mounting  bracket. The bracket is just a sheet metal
channel which extends out from the bus and has three wheel bolts attached.
This attaches to the front of the bus with pop nuts. These are like large
pop rivets with a thread in so you can screw bolts into them. I hired the
fixing tool and used 10 mm headed nuts. It's pretty difficult to use
conventional nuts and bolts as you can't get round the back of the front
panel.

Got my mounting bracket from a scrap yard.

The mount is quite strong, but be warned that the wheel will stick out ahead
of the front bumper, unless you also extend that out. I think maybe you've
seen those versions with a sort of horseshoe shaped cover which sits on the
bumper. For me they look rather ugly.

I rolled my van into a wall recently and the wheel took all the strain,
caving the front panel in. OK I've pulled it out but I was pretty annoyed at
the time, but I was warned.
