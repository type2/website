 So what did it cost you for all the pieces including
 shipping?

I believe it cost around $200 +/-.  I got the same
density foam as the original (Good point Greg Potts). 
I believe it was called medium density.  The foam is
blue.  But I also got some type of batting on it which
makes it a little more &quot;sittable&quot; but does not affect
the dimensions at all.  I believe I ordered 8 feet x 4
feet of 1 3/4&quot;, (for the upper bunk) 3 feet x 4 feet
of 2 1/2&quot; (for the cushion over the engine
compartment) and 3 feet x 4 feet of 3&quot; (for the fold
down rear seat). CAUTION!  please measure your own
cushions as I'm doing this from memory here!  Except
for the color of the foam and the additional batting I
ordered, the density and every thing else about it is
just like the original. I've already stuffed 2
cushions and it looks great.  Greg
