Subject: [T2] trip report, willits, ca.- long

1. like many of you, i saw the post to us all regarding a double cab for
sale in the excite_dot_com classifieds for fifteen hundred dollars. having
waited for an opportunity to buy a double cab splitty, bay, or vanagon
within my budget my attennae went sky high. with two small kids and a
business which requires medium weight haulin, the only rig i had intended
to buy was a vw double cab.

the person i assumed owned the vehicle named jan replied to my email friday
night. during a phone call that evening i learned it was on her rented
property, and she stated her husband, billy, was half owner along with an
in-law named percy. jan was having difficulty with the phone and that
turned out to be the one connection before she lost her phoneline. we had
one more communication via email; she hooked her computer to her neighbor's
phoneline, letting me know the bus was driveable, had a little rust, and
would be roadworthy.

since he'd gone off-list and for all i knew off email, i phoned listmember
mike to suss out the pickup. i found his number on the a.i.r.s. list.
having had off-list experience with him, coupled with he lived a few
minutes south of willits made it easier for me to ask his help regarding
this dearly sought after vehicle. there were no photos nor clear
discriptions of the vehicle up to his point. mike agreed to spin up and
take the pickup over the good sized hills on highway 101, and bring his
digital camera to snap daytime photos. on my end, i quickly added a hitch
to my jeep figuring i could always use it no matter what double cab came
though someday.

mike emailed 10 photos which put the pickup in my borderline catagory.
though i was told by jan there was a slight buckle in the front, i had no
idea the entire nose needed replacement and no front bumper existed. the
rockers weren't too bad, but the front floor was nearly totaled. it had
holes, surface rust, and it looked plain dankity wet. i still had a good
feeling about it. the gates i rated high enough. even though mike and billy
were able to get it running it was not to be tested on streets - certainly
not a runner back to oregon. no brakes - in fact, the registration had
lapsed and the title was lost.

2. i left oregon with the understanding from mike that a deal could be
worked out without title. he assured me given his 26 years of experience on
the highway patrol and selling cars between states that a square deal could
be made. relying upon his facts that duplicate title with power of attorney
could be had, i drove south and made mendocino county in nine hours.

meeting mike and his family was tremendous. now warm and comfortable, any
stress of the trip down high 5, and east on 20, to an unfamiliar place, was
released within moments of arrival. i slept on the coziest sofa bed knowing
we didn't have a clear idea of what we were really getting into: adventure
had begun. discussing the pick up with mike in person gave me a lot more
confidence and assurance this could work out.

we drove in mike's 74 westy and made our way six miles north of willets via
highway 101. forgot to call jan first. near 10am we made it to the place
where the double cab had sat. we wheeled up the slimey muddy driveway
fashioned at a steep forty-five degree angle to the highway. the entire
place was just a bit overwhelming. two very run down buildings, one 5th
wheel trailer, a tent, and a tarp on poles all filled with multitudes of
uncollectable items. unforgettable in general, too out there to take visual
inventory. we only poked around from shack to shack looking for life forms,
but we only came upon the loose dogs that came across us. that the sun
never directly shone on the property kept the whole place damp. thus
caution was the order so not to slip on old dog crud and the hundreds of
feet of extention chords that lay below our feet.

the double cab was ankle high in thicket. it was difficult to see beneath,
and the bed was lined high with odds and ends. but what i could see on the
vw was very good. most of the rust was localized in the cab front floor.
certainly a cosmetic basket case because of the nose, and some very old
rubber on the tires and windows, it was not impossible to bring this one
back for life. it sat well despite of the weight of wet whatever was in
there. fortunately it sat at an angle so it didn't accumulate big water.
since we were not invited onto the property, we took a screaming quick look
at the double cab in ten minutes and left a note saying we'd return at 4pm
- please stick around then. knowing it ran, or rather it wasn't frozen, i
had a number in mind.

3. mike and i tooled around the southern part of the county in his westy
during the rest of the morning and early afternoon. he worked on a few
machines in and around ukiah, and by 3pm we grabbed a snack to go, and
headed up to the site of the bus again. on his cellphone we called the
folks ahead this time but no answer. called percy, the feller holding
title. his wife rita said he was dropping their son to go to oakland; that
he is waiting for the greyhound to pull into gribaldo's restaurant. she
described him and reminded us it was right on highway 101. we found him en
route sure as shinola just as described. wirey hair, red/black checkered
vest, baseball cap. we discussed a few things and the pick up. on second
thought i decided not to negotiate at the pickup north of town. instead -
deal right there. i sensed sentimentality for the truck in percy and felt
we should deal away from the vehicle.

he agreed to my number, and we continued talking while he signed power of
attorney and all that stuff. mike helped fill out the forms while percy and
i planned the next hour. meanwhile, another feller cruised from behind the
westy but didn't speak. he tried to utter words but words didn't come out.
myron, as it were, eventually needed lost keys and a ride to them. mike
agreed, so myron retruned from the bus stop and moved into the westy with
three giant sized suitcases, duffles, backpack, loose books, and a vague
idea his keys lay at a gas station near a safeway supermarket. after we
were at the wrong station, i asked mike to drop me at the police station
where i could pick up my jeep to run and get an auto transport, whlie my
thousand cash dollars were still attached. we rounded up at the site of the
bus at dusk. mike had gone to a few more gas stations before dropping myron
at  the mc donalds across from gribaldo's.

with the sun near set everybody was at the double cab and excitement was
there to greet me. jan, billy, percy, rita, a few young teenager kids, and
mike were getting the pickup to take fuel like a dry mouth in the desert.
percy had his amber fifth in a front pocket knowing money was on the way.
his confidence gave me more encouragement which i needed later. first thing
i did was get stuck down low on the driveway. the tail light of the auto
tansport was inches from the highway where logger trucks went by doing
65mph. we agreed it was best to put the jeep and tow on the small turnout
opposite jan and billy's.  the pick up could be run on its own power, down
the driveway and across the street, and loaded there.

4. because the driveway was between downward curves 50 yards north and
south of the driveway; and it was dark by now, we decided to have a person
and flashlight at each curve. both would yell when the curve was clear
signaling the jeep and tow could return to the highway backward, across the
street and parked in the turnout (providing nobody else needed it at that
moment). that was scary, but worked and the fellers on the flashlight
returned to find the tow okay but the jeep was half off the road. mike
brought the westy around and with a tow line tried to pull me out. percy
was on the rear pushing the tow with his other car. no luck. mike picked up
the rpm's and fishtailed a lot, and over the sound of spinning wheels i
heard percy crunching his grille onto the auto transport. aye. all things
came to a halt. a closer look found the mile marker wrapped between the
passenger wheel well and a new michelin. mike got that big old iron out in
short order, though it seemed a job too much for AAA at the time. back in
the westy and me in low gear, he pulled me out of the blackberries. men at
the curves on the highway again - i had to make a u-turn so the pick up
could go right on in from the driveway across the street.

percy turned the vehicle around on the property (no small task) and drove
to the bottom of the hilly driveway. just about everybody was screaming go
now! as he stepped on the gas and put the pick up in first gear at the
solid white line of the highway his twelve year old son calmly walked in
front of the nearly moving rig and said no - wait. saved percy's life. then
with a romp across the dark highway and a push from all, percy got the vw
onto the auto transport and maike and i headed to ukiah for a very late
appointment with mike's friend at the monday night football buffet. i went
along thinking it best to head north early in the morning with nobody on
state 20. after the third quarter we headed back to mike's in separate
cars. mike offered to move his 74 and 60sc so i could spin around the tree
used as a turnabout in his driveway. when he came out to greet me and
remind me there was a 14 inch stump very near the turn, i had already run
my bumper over it - stuck cold with the stump a half inch or less from the
radiator. jacked up the jeep, brought it down on a 4x6 and rolled off and
said, mike, i'm only trying to make this as rediculous as possible. he
smiled and said, i know.
