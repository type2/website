Subject: Re: Is this *BAD* customer service or what?

I have been using Just Kampers regularly since purchasing Matilda 3 months
ago. I have had every thing delivered promptly to the correct address and
have received the correct parts. On a recent trip to the New Forest they
even delivered an awning direct to the campsite before 10am for me, so I was
shocked to hear of such appalling service from a company I have come to rely
on. I do feel though that you have just been incredibally unlucky. I would
ask to speak to the owners or write to them demanding compensation . If they
are a half decent company I sure they will comply even if it is just to
offer you discount.
