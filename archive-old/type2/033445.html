Subject: Re: Mexico deposit

Now this is a twist.  While most of us have been
scheming ways to get some of those nice Mexican
buses back into the states, THEY think we are planning
to smuggle our rusty oldies back down there.

Am I missing something or are the Mexicans just
trying to kill their tourist business?

&gt;There is indeed a &quot;deposit&quot; to get into Mexico unless you are going to Baja
or to the northern half of Sonora, which includes Rocky Point (Puerto
Penansco).  Many people believe that getting the deposit back could be a
lengthy process due to the general way that the Mexican government works.
&gt;
&gt;Along the same subject... My wife and daughter and I are planning a 2 month
trip through Mexico, into Guatemala and Belize, and back and are looking for
some other buses who are interested.  Please email me back off of the list!
