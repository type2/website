&gt; &gt; 1) what shoud I look for in terms of defects?
 
look at the valve seats (where the face of the valves sit in the combustion ports)Type 4 VW heads weren't pressed in with adequate &quot;interference fit&quot; at the factory and the seats tend to collapse. 

Also look at the surface of the outer ring on each combustion port, where the cylinder will be seating, is the metal all pitted and torn up? This will cause a loss of compression.

&gt; &gt; 3) it seems to come from a '78 van.   Didn't they have hydrolic valves,
&gt; &gt; and does that effect the head.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, they did have hydraulic lifters, but looking at the catalogs, the
&gt; heads are the same for non-hydraulics.

However the valve springs are stiffer. You really should switch your springs over from the 77 so the valve spring stiffness is uniform on both your heads.
