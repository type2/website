Here are some directions to the fairgrounds for
the VW meet on Oct. 18th.
From Seattle and the north
                          1. Take Interstate 5 south to Exit 142B in
Federal Way. Stay in the left lane as you exit.

                          2. Turn right at the traffic light at the end
of the exit ramp, then turn left at the first traffic light onto
                          state Route 161.

                          3. Drive about 8 miles into the Puyallup
Valley - Route 161 becomes Meridian Street once you're in
                          Puyallup. Continue south through town. The
fairgrounds will be on your right, at Ninth Avenue
                          Southwest.

                          From Seattle, Bellevue and the Eastside
                          1. From Seattle, take Interstate 5 South to
the Interstate 405 North interchange/Exit 154A, heading
                          toward Renton. Coming from the Eastside? Take
Interstate 90 to Interstate 405 South.

                          2. Take Exit 2 to state Route 167 toward
Kent/Auburn. Drive south on Route 167 for 20.2 miles to
                          Route 161 South/state Route 512 West.

                          3. Drive 2.3 miles to the second exit, which
is Meridian Street South. At the end of the exit, turn
                          right at the light. The fairground is on your
left.

No info yet as to camp area availablity. I am checking and will post
anything I can find on overnighting on the 17th.
