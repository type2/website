Subject: want to borrow / rent berg tool

anyone out there have a berg 740, the in-car valve-spring remover? 
i'd love to beg, borrow or rent it off you for a week - i want to try 
2 different spring sets on a bus, and would rather not remove the 
heads to do so :)
i am borrowing a similar non-vw tool from a list vendor, but we are 
not sure it will work..
i am quite happy to pay the full amount of the tool + shipping both 
ways; refund over whatever we decide was fair upon safe return.
