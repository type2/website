Subject: First time engine pull....

Well, I've bit the bullet and decided to take the 2.0 liter fuel injected
engine out of my air-cooled '80 Westy. I know little history of this engine
from the previous owners and myself have not ventured to do more than sleuth a
vacuum leak or ten. This being said, I've read the Bentley manual regarding
engine removal and it doesn't have anything to say about removing the engine
tin. I plan to replace all the tin as it's a rusty mess. My question...
Do I need to remove the tin before pulling the engine (I believe I do) and if
so, does anyone have any insight into how this is most easily done? Some of
the pieces come out pretty easy, others (like the firewall) have wires coming
through.
Also, I know I've read it before in this forum, but what is the best
way/product to use to degrease the engine and clean up all the parts I've
already taken off?
Lastly, I plan on sending my injectors in to a company called Cruzin
Performance in MI to be tested and cleaned. Does anyone have any experience
with these guys and/or is this something that I really need to do?
Thanks in advance.....hoping this doesn't turn into a summer long project!
