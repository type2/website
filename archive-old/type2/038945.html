Subject: Green Loctite is great

On my 70 westy, the passenger mirror has been loose for a couple of years. 
After reading the thread about green Locktite wicking into the cracks and 
holding something firm, I went to my FLAPS and bought some. It worked just 
great, so green Locktite is the thing to use for holding adjustable mirrors 
that have gone floppy.
