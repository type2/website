Subject: Re: [T2] Horns As Usual

Hella makes some air horns using this setup, the only thing I've heard
negative about them is since there's no air tank, there is a slight delay
between when you hit the button and when the horn actually sounds because
the compressor doesn't activate until you hit the button.

I suppose you could wire the compressor to be on all the time the ignition
is on but I don't know if that's recommended for compressor longevity.

Still would be neat to have air horns :-)

I might like the dual-tone horns from a Karmann Ghia.

&gt; No tank - the compressor is the same size as a Coke can.
&gt;
&gt; The horns themselves are the same size as electric horns and can mount
&gt; under the bumper just like electric horns.
