I have towed several Buses and I prefer to hook to the front beam. I built a
tow bar that hooks to the bumper bolts. I towed a 74 Bus from Tacoma Wa. To
Salem Or. And then the new owner towed it to the Coast. It worked fine for
both of us, but I never did like the fact that it only used 4 small bolts.(I
added several safety chains)
I have also towed them with a Bug tow bar attached to the sway bar for very
short tows, this is a bad way to go. Way too much play and the Bus is about
2 feet behind the tow vehicle. I am now building a tow bar that will attach
to the beam with U-Bolts from a rear wheel drive cars axle(the spring to
axle U-bolts). These U-bolts are very strong and at least grade 5 not like
the grade 3 All-thread. If you get one that attaches to the beam, you can
tow any year. If it attaches to the bumper only, you are limited to up to
72, or 73+. I have never towed a Vanagon.

Howdy Folks,

The wife and I have discussed it and determined that since we intend to keep
Bess until it will no longer physically roll, we've come to the logical
conclusion that we will most likely tow her or someone else's bus again (and
again) in the future.

So, I'm trying to decide what kind of a tow bar to get.  I've seen several
that hook in to the tow hooks already on the Bus.  There are many that hook
into the bumper!  And finally, I've heard about some that fit onto the
cross-beam.

Any reccomendations on which way to go here?  Is the bumper strong enough to
use for pulling?   Are the tow hooks strong enough?

I would appreciate your input!

Thanks,

Darrin K. Pierce
