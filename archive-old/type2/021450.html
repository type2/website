Subject: Door Damage Estimate - please advise

Hello,
I am looking to purchase a bus but it's got some damage on the front
door.  Apparently the door strap was not in place and the door blew open
and went a little too far.  The door dented in but the hinges are still
good (according the the seller).

Could any of you please look at the pics and let me know how much it
would cost to repair the damage.  I'm thinking of asking for the amount
that it would cost to fix it subtracted from the asking price.  What do
you think is fair?

the holes are where the owner drilled and pulled the door and the
lighter green paint is rust-preventive paint.

here's the url:

I'd appreciate your help..

Thanks,
Mike
