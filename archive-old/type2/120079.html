73 Westy...
what type of lettering/badging is on the outside (stock)?
Does it have any silver lettering on the back (&quot;volkswagen&quot;)?
Does it say &quot;Westfalia&quot; on the front and/or back of the poptop?
 
I have seen this on other years but not sure what is specific to 1973.
Thanks, have a good weekend!  -Chris
