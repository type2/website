&gt; Subject: How do I get the #&amp;(*&amp;!$# distributor gear on the crank?
&gt; I've been trying to get the brass distributor gear on my 2 crankshafts,
&gt; (rebuiling a couple of 2.0l air-cooled engines) and haven't succeded yet.
&gt;
&gt; Has anybody done this before, and can give me some hints as to how it's 
&gt; done?


Tom,

Some people will rail you with horror stories about not using a torch, 
metal composition, etc. Dont sweat that too much. Boiling the gear in 
smoking hot oil (or tranny fluid? How do you keep from tossing your
cookies from the putrid smell of burning tranny oil?)

I suspend the gear on a nail clamped in the bench vice. Heat it round
and round with a Burnzomatic. Dont let the torch sit on one spot too 
long and dont put the point of the blue flame right on the metal. 
It takes about two minutes, mabye longer if the gear was real cold.
The test I use to see if it is done: My trusty tooth brush handle. It will
melt quickly at about 350 degrees. Only touch it on the gear a little to see
if it melts. If it does, it is hot enough.

No need for me to put the crank in the freezer, it is only 20 degrees
in my shed most of the winter. The gear just drops right on there and can 
actually be bumped for about 5 seconds until it cools. Same thing
with the steel cam drive gear. With the crank on the flywheel, facing
up, no tapping or anything is required, it will sit right down on there.

Good luck, I just did it last week and amazed my friends how easy
it was.
