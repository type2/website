Subject: RE: [T2] WR1

From: &quot;Casting Fool&quot;
And the $20.00 WR1 kit is an inexpensive method of eliminating a
possible problem with the starter.


Mike when my starter was bad I put in a WR1 kit thinking the same thing.
There were a few on the list that suggested a new starter, but many
suggested the WR1. Long story short, I ended up needing a new starter
and wasted 1/6 of the cost on a WR1 kit.

In my case it was definitely &quot;false economy&quot;

Thanks
