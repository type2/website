Subject: &quot;new&quot; engine follow-up

It turns out the oil leak was the oil filler neck needing to be tightened
up a tad.

The timing issue was that there was an 009 condensor on the vac adv/ret
dizzy and it was in the way of turning the dizzy for proper timing.

The pop-pop-popping was a tight #1 valve (I forget which one).

All better!

Nikki
