It could be an out of round tire. Have you slammed on the brakes lately? If
so maybe you have flatspotted a tire, but from your description I doubt it.
Jack up the front end and spin the tire and look for the obvious.

&gt; Well, I took the bus back to the place where I had the
&gt; tires mounted.  It appeared that the driver's side
&gt; front tire had lost its weight.  Well, they put the
&gt; new weight on the inside of the wheel.  All of the
&gt; others are on the outside.  That seemed a bit odd to
&gt; me.
&gt;
&gt; The main reason I took it in, was due to the whomp
&gt; whomp I get under the floor on the driver's side.  I
&gt; assumed it was a tire balance problem.
&gt;
&gt; So here's the run down: I have new bearings, tie
&gt; rods/ends, draglink, balljoints, sway bar rubber
&gt; mounts, new tires, new shocks and a front end
&gt; alignment.  The sound occurs at 35 mph and &quot;goes away&quot;
&gt; when faster.  The speedometer moves with the sound
&gt; (flickering with the oscilation I guess.)
&gt;
&gt; What else could it be?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks everyone!
