Subject: Idle mixture enrichment device for 72-74 bus 

--=====================_27231466==_.ALT

Does anyone know the purpose of the rectangular box on the left carb for 
72-74 buses that serves as an idle mixture enrichment device?  My former 
buses did not have one but I just bought a carb to go on my new truck and 
it has one.  I was wondering what would happen if i left it unhooked 
electrically.  thanks, greg
