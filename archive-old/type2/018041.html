Crawling around under my bus  I noticed two studs projecting from the
right side (FRONT being front) of the bottom of the crankcase--the part
with the cooling fins. This is a 74 with dual Solex. What should be
attached to the studs?

Close by is what I assume is the fuel pump. There is a small tube
projecting downward about 45 degrees with a flange fitting for a hose.
What hose am I missing here?

Evidently these things aren't critical to the operation of the engine,
but I'd sure feel better having everything in order.

Thanks
