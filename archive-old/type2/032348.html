&gt; It's a plate and a ball that goes in between the shifter plate and the
&gt; floor. It shortens the shifter's movement. If you hit the ashtray with your
&gt; kuckels when you shift to first and third this is the thing for you;-) 

--&gt;  However, check your shift coupling first.  I thought it was *normal*
to have to lean over to put a VW van in 3rd gear...then I installed a new
shift coupler, and was amazed at how tight and precise my shift pattern
suddenly got. ;)

Besides, isn't it a feature that your knuckles hit the emergency brake
lever when you go for 3rd gear, if it's pulled out?  I thought that was to
keep me from accidentally driving with it set. ;)
