It is easier than just about any other car, but it is still a bit of a
task.  The &quot;four bolts&quot; is the attachment on a Bug, but you also have to
deal with throttle cable, heater cables and ducts, fuel line, and several
electrical connections.

On a bus, add removing the bumper and apron and removing the rear mount,
along with supporting the transaxle if it is an early Bay.

It's not difficult, but I think that a good mechanic would charge a couple
of hours labor for this and be reasonable.  There's always _something_ to
fix before the engine goes back in.
