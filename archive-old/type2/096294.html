&gt; hey guys, my ex broke my bus &gt;:(
&gt; we yanked on the inner sliding door handle like it was excaliber stuck in
&gt; the stone... SNAPPED IT RIGHT OFF!!! i was so mad... what was he

is that why he is now your &quot;ex&quot;?????

&gt; called BugHaus here in tulsa ( http://bughaus_dot_com ) and they dont have
&gt; any in stock, they only come straight from VW and they cost $39.95!!!

try BustedBus they are up your neck of the woods (ok colorado) but he has
that kind of stuff.

&gt; needing help from you kind folks to hook me up. there is no reason this
&gt; item should cost that much. it is just a plastic handle, for crying out
&gt; loud! so if anyone has one, please let me know... thanks. i think what
&gt; upsets me more than anything (because he really really feels bad about
&gt; it) is that it was something i actually didn't need to replace... NOW I
&gt; DO! and i wouldn't have if he hadn't yanked it as hard as he did. i
&gt; honestly believe it would have lasted ME a very long time.

well that plastic ages and not gracefully it might have been ready to let
go at any moment anyway..... I use my sliding side door everytime I use my
bus so it gets lots of abuse...after breaking a couple of those plastic
handles ($$$$) I just broke down and made one of aluminum bar stock and
it has not given me any problems in 7-8 years.  figure if I ever sell the
thing and it makes a difference I will put the old one back on, but form
follows function....
