Some here have read my previous tome describing how my '72 Westy Roconante
got a new engine this March.

After tearing down the old engine, it became clear that the best course of
action was to do a complete engine rebuild with new heads, cylinders, etc.
After deciding on this, I decided to take it one step further.

I put the question to the mechanic &quot;How could we do this rebuild better and
make it last longer if I were willing to spend a little more money?&quot;  He
thought about this just a minute before answering that if I had an extra
$200 to spend that doing a precision engine balancing is what he would do
if it were his own engine.

For those who do not know what is involved: brand new pistons and
connecting rods come from the factory with plus-or-minus 10 grams, and
sometimes up to 20 grams difference in weight.  The precision engine
balance involves weighing these parts then filing at them until they are
all exactly the same weight.  Next, the crankshaft and flywheel are spun on
a machine, similar to spin balancing tires, and machined until they are
balanced.  Racers do this to their engines so they do not vibrate to pieces
at 12,000 RPM.

My results: Well, I am reminded of the story of the wife who did not know
her husband was a drunk until he came home sober one night.  I never knew a
VW Type IV 1800 engine could idle so smoothly.  None of my previous engines
come close.

Other than the vibration-free idle, I cannot see much difference yet.
Several years from now, I hope to be able to report that I got an extra
50,000 miles from this engine, and that my $200 was well spent.  We will
just have to wait and see.
