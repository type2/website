&gt;you mean the engine tine screws, right?   use a big screwdriver, or vice
&gt;grips on the screw to loosen, or vice grips on the big screwdriver while
&gt;pushing the screwdriver to the screwhead.

One thing I've had to do is use one of those hammer driven impact wrenches
with a screw driver bit on the end. It'll loosen up just about anything.
