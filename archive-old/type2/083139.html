Subject: Re: [T2] so we got in the red vw microbus, and headed toward the police officer station!

Hi Bus Gypsy,
Back in 81, I had a 72 westy w/o pop top that had
everything going against it: Dead stickers everywhere,
questionable items hidden throughout, and a very
questionable long-hair at the wheel. Me and my pals
drove and camped all over Southern Cal for many years
with no problems at all. The only incident I ever had
was when I was with my future wife. We were pulled off
onto a deserted road at night, testing out the fold
out bed when we were rudely interrupted by a loud
knock on the slider. It was a Riverside police
officer, but he just wanted to make sure we were both
there of our own free will - WHEWW! However he did
tell us we had to move it along and explained that if
he couldn't have any fun that night, we weren't going
to either. As he didn't search the bus, I was all too
happy to comply.

&gt; Happy Friday everyone!  
&gt; 
&gt;  I'm doing a little survey, a bit of research you
&gt; could say.  I have been all over the country, but I
&gt; have only had the pleasure of driving a bus on the
&gt; east coast, and the west.  Mass, and Cal. to be
&gt; exact.  In California, I had a 67 deluxe, and I had
&gt; a 71 westie.  Driving a vintage VW is a lot more
&gt; common out there.  Very rarely was I ever pulled
&gt; over by police, in fact, never. And I lived out
&gt; there for a while.  When I grew up, I lived in Mass,
&gt; and it seemed that just being in a VW bus put you at
&gt; risk of being pulled over, and hassled.  And a
&gt; deadhead sticker on it, then you are really asking
&gt; for trouble!!!
&gt; I'm wondering if it is a problem everyone faces, or
&gt; does it vary state, to state?  If the bus is mint,
&gt; is it different?  Answers, comments, and stories
&gt; appreciated!!  :)  
&gt;                                       Bus Gypsy
