&gt; Hello All,
&gt; I have a 1979 FI bus.  I hope this isn't too much of
&gt; an idiotic question 
&gt; (I've already spent half my lunch hour perusing the
&gt; archives), but I gotta 
&gt; know:  Is there a way to open the small plastic
&gt; rectangular electrical 
&gt; connectors you often see between two connecting
&gt; wires (that is, the ones 
&gt; that hold and connect the metal spades at the ends
&gt; of the two wires)?  I 
&gt; need to replace my cylinder head temperature sensor
&gt; and last night went out 
&gt; to have a look at everything and found this
&gt; connector where the sensor wire 
&gt; connects to (assumably) the wire leading to the FI
&gt; harness.  The plastic 
&gt; connector seemed permanently closed and not meant to
&gt; ever be opened.  Is 
&gt; there a way I can open that thing up? 
It is not designed to be opened. Just pull and one
side comes out... The sensor end comes out. If you can
reach in a bit and grab the shank of the connector
with needle-noseds you should be able to wiggle it a
bit and pull it straight out. The other replier was
referring to removing the connectors out of plastic
plugs - not the same situation. What you are doing is
designed to pull apart easily. -BaH
