&gt; &gt; My 1.8 is leaking exaust from the joint between the head and the 
heater
&gt; &gt; box.  I have four newish never installed metal gaskets.  What other
&gt; &gt; products will I need to complete this repair.

If these are the metal/fiber sandwich gaskets, fine.  Otherwise, get 
them!

&gt; In practice:
&gt; 
&gt; Tips:
&gt; 
&gt; The evening before you plan this job, get under the bus and remove 
the
&gt; deflector tins beneath your cylinders, then drive around for 15-20 
minutes
&gt; until the bus is thoroughly warmed up.  Park it where you will be 
working
&gt; on it, crawl underneath it and hit every nut on the exhaust with 
Kroil
&gt; while they are hot!  Go inside, have a drink (your choice) and go to
&gt; sleep.  If you have trouble sleeping, go back out in a couple hours 
and
&gt; hit it with more Kroil.  The next morning, hit it with more Kroil 
(get the
&gt; feeling there is no max limit on this? :-) and start in on nut 
removal.

There really is no limit, and hitting them for a week or two, with 
periodic driving will help to get the lube into the threads.  You want 
the oil to be there along with thermal cycling to help it into the 
tiny crevices.

&gt; All is fair in nut removal. A set of cheap sockets and a set of inch
&gt; sockets are good things... those nuts will be all sorts of sizes 
other
&gt; than 13mm and you want the 6-point socket that fits tightest.
&gt; 
&gt; Before you put the socket on, take a punch and bang a bit on the nut 
(stay
&gt; away from the threads!)

A cool tool is a &quot;nut cracker&quot; that splits the nut in two.  It will 
work when nothing else does.

When reinstalling, do not fail to apply anti-sieze compound to the nut 
and stud.  If you do this, your life will be much easier the next time 
you have to remove the nut.  I've never had a stud break when treated 
with anti-sieze.
