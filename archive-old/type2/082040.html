Subject: battery/city power?

I took Elvis out for 'our' shakedown camping cruise this past weekend =
and had a little problem with the city power (I think). The fridge would =
work when on battery power but would not on city power. However, the =
receptacle below the rear seat did work fine as I ran a portable =
electric heater all night long. Kind of a bummer to not be able to use =
the fridge though. I put a new auxilliary battery in before I left and I =
was wondering if maybe I did something wrong? Another thing, how do I =
fill the water tank? Is it through that pvc thing next to the sink or do =
I hook a hose up to the outside?
Thanks,
Richard
