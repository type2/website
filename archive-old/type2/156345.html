Subject: Re: [T2] More Insurance Questions

&gt; Comprehensive is all about damage to your vehicle.
&gt;
&gt; It is my understanding that if you don't have comprehensive
&gt; from *your* insurance company, that the other insurance company is not
&gt; going to pay anything either....or at minimal, blue book.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, whether it is your fault or the other guy's fault,
&gt; *your* insurance company will pony up the bucks and then *they* fight with
&gt; the other insurance company about the amount.

In Florida we have uninsured motorist coverage. Thats so your own
insurance will cover your damage if you cant collect from someone else
whos fault it is.
We also have collision and comprehensive seperately written into policies.
Collision if its your fault, fixes your car.
Comp for theft, fire, storm damage etc etc.
We also have PIP, personal injury protection. Which is the only mandatory
coverage as well as Liability.
Every part is an option.
