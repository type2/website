A description of how the poptop looks when opened, plus a description of the

&gt;&gt;  Are you sure you have a Westfalia and not another conversion?  There
were several camper companies making top during the 60s and 70s, yours could
be a replacement or one of those other brands of camper. Send pictures if
you can and we will take a look.  &lt;&lt;
