&gt; I'll weigh in on this discussion, I use the Hazet ring band type ring
&gt; compressor that is adjustable, it will do any size piston you will ever need
&gt; to do unless you are building giant truck engines. It is the tool you see in
&gt; some of the VW manuals.
&gt;
&gt; If you find the hazet a bit pricey you can use an inexpensive Lisle
&gt; wrinkle-band ring compressor which works very well for about 15% of the
&gt; money.
&gt;
hmmm, when I couldn't find my ring compressor some many years ago I used a
correct sized hose clamp, worked so well that's all I've ever used since
then..   about a buck at a hardware store.
