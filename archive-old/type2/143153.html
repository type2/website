&gt; I still don't have a thermostat assembly, but I'm wondering how important
&gt; it would be for me to actually own one.
&gt;


You'll hear conflicting opinions, but here's how I look at it:

What's the average temp in FL? Around 75-80 right? What's your engine's
operating temp? Quite a bit higher. The less time an engine spends at
something other than its operating temp, the cleaner it will run, the longer
it will last.

But that's my opinion.

I spoke to Chris yesterday and he says he has a couple of thermostats at
Busted Bus. Raby's Aircooled is where I got mine, but I don't know if they
have any more.
