Subject: Re: [T2] Fan squeeling UUUUUUUUUUUGH

i just got over the same problem with mine. i tried
takin off some bolts, helped, till i started to drive
off. so what i did was i just drove the hell outta it
with is squealing, with a huge smile on my face, and
me saying, hey, if they dont like the squeal, they can
pass me. it eventually stopped, and i dont know why it
started, or how it stopped. now, im not suggesting you
to just drive like that, as i might have just gotten
lucky, but if you try everything you can, and it still
squeals, then just drive with it. did you just get
through painting the shroud or fan?
