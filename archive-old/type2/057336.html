Subject: What to do with the motor out

I just pulled the motor out of my recently acquired 1970 Camper, and let me
say after owning 3 Ghias and a Beetle (this is my first Bus) that the
simplicity of the engine pull was very nice...That dropping it out the
bottom is simply nutty.

ANYWAY...

My camper SUPPOSEDLY has 56K original miles, although I cannot prove it.
It is in very nice shape, but I pulled the motor to clean it up (it was in
storage for 15 years...Lots of dust) and replace some seals, etc, etc.  

While the motor is out, what else should I check / replace?  I plan on
removing and flushing the gas tank, replacing the fuel lines, and I have a
torn CV boot that I thought would be easy to fix now since the motor is on
the floor.  I was of course going to check the wear on the clutch and
replace the engine compartment seal.

Before I put the motor back in a couple of weeks and say &quot;Why didn't I
_____ while I had the motor out?&quot;, can anyone list a few things that one
might want to do while it is out?  Like preventive maintenance things.

This might be a sermon, but that is another post all together.

Thanks in advance
Derrick Lathem
