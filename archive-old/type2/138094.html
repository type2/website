Don't be afraid of the Type 4 engine or the FI.  The FI is way easier 
to work on than carbs, and the Type 4 engine is easy to work on and not 
really that different in principle from the Type 1 engine.  Besides the 
Type 4 engine is a better engine :-)

If I were you, I'd look for a '76 - '78 Westy.
