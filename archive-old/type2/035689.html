Hi Volks,
   Well seems like many of us think alike.  I too am considering making a 
cover for the hole in the roof of our 71 westy.  Like Jarrett, I was 
thinking of making it like a quilted blanket.  In addition, I think I'll 
build lateral stays into it that will sit on top of the roof. That should 
prevent it from sagging too much.
   A second idea I've had is to replace the screens in the jealousy windows 
with pieces of lexan or plexiglass.  Has anyone ever tried this ?
