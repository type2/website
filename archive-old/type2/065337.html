Any ideas 
on where to look for parts (before turning to a junkyard or parts 
bus)?  Also, is it possible to replace these with another type of 
window?

So I wrote:
If your conversion used a louvered window from a '70's bus, your best
bet it to replace the whole unit with a used one. It should come out
easily if you undo the 20 or so screws holding it in around the inside
edge. I'm pretty sure it is the same size as the nice sliding
windows seen on '80's buses too, if you wanted to put one of
those in instead. I saw a '70's bus with an '80's window and no
apparent mods necessary. Can anyone out there confirm this?
(ANyone with a tape measure and the right buses in the 
parking lot COULD confirm this...)

I'll bet you could get a used window off a parts bus for a price you would like.

Good luck,
