Subject: What to see

Between Arizona and Louisiana there is nothing to see  Grand Canyon...next stop
New Orleans.. Unless you go by way of New Mexico and Colorado..IMHO  I've always
enjoyed the trip north from Louisiana along the coast, but you can go north
through the Natchez Trace, arkansas Blue ridge etc.... John Jensen in Annapolis
