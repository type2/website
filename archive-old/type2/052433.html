Due to the earthquake in Seattle this morning, the server that
runs the vintagebus and type2 list is down.  We do not have an ETA
yet.  I hope you're not posting &quot;Is the list down&quot; messages right now...

Thank you for your patience...

If you're getting this message, but had previously unsubscribed to
the list, don't fret!  I'm using an archived copy of the list
membership, which you may still be on.  When I update the archive,
you won't get these informational message any more.  Sorry about that...

You can also check the status of the list at

Thank you for your patience.
