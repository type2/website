Subject: life of bus/engine

To add to the thread on life span of a bus.....my 71 bus died of axle rot
with 225,000 mi on it, rebuilt the engine myself at 90k and around
140K.....I have a 77 Westie with an honest 204K on ORIGINAL engine
(according to PO who kept it maintained but not rebuilt), still has 120psi
compression; it's a parts van now with its front end, posts, and axle
rotted....and my 78 Westie with 176,000 mi and honest 135psi comp. on
original non-rebuilt engine.  So how many go over 200K with nary a valve
job or engine pull?
