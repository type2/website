&gt;Sorry about your painful lesson...BTW I think your signature line is from
&gt;Chance in Jerzy Kozinski's novel &quot;Being There&quot;.  Peter Sellers starred in
&gt;the movie of the same name.  Who's d. miller?

Jody,  you could be right.  I 've been using that line for so long I've
forgotten when or where I'd ever heard it so I'd just attributed it to
me :).  Looks like I've got a trip to the video store planned.

Bus content:  I sealed my gas tank with the Por product early in the 
spring and it's been curing ever since.  Seems to be a fairly hard 
product.  I give an update after I've run the bus for a year or so.

Looks like I'll have to come up with something else.
