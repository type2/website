Sue,

WHY! WHY! WHY!
I would have to question pulling the engine to determine the problem.  What
do they mean when they say it won't turn all the way?  You said it *TURNED
OVER* fine after you replaced the switch, right?
Suggest you have an open discussion with them before they pull the engine.
Try and  find out what they are specifically!planning to( initially)
diagnose with the engine out, that they couldn't diagnose with it still in
the bus..........

I would get the facts, and an ESTIMATE before they pull ANYTHING......

By the way if you would like to discuss this with a woman send a p-mail to
me for my assistant, Milissa, she has worked with me, and for many* German
*auto repair shops, as a Tech writer here in So Cal.......

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; I've been pretty much a lurker so far because, well, I haven't actually
&gt; driven my Westy yet. Here's the scoop. It ran fine when I looked at it.
Then
&gt; I bought it, had it towed home (not because it couldn't be driven but
because
&gt; I was in NJ and it was in Philly and the city was about to tow it in their
&gt; effort to clean up for the Republican Convention later this month...
forgive
&gt; me I digress!). So it was towed here. I have a knack for buying VWs that
run
&gt; when I look at them and then stop running as soon as they arrive here!
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I replaced the ignition switch (which was bad when I bought it),
and
&gt; then it wouldn't start. Turned over fine, just never caught. Then I went
on
&gt; vacation to the UK. When I came back there were stickers on it that it
would
&gt; be towed in 24 hours if not removed from the parking lot (condo). Not
being
&gt; able to start it, and new to all this, what did I do? I had it towed to
the
&gt; only local aircooled shop I knew of.
&gt;
&gt; They say the engine won't turn all the way and that I'm probably looking
at a
&gt; rebuild job. They seem like nice people, though I have no experience with
&gt; them, but I'm hesitant to go the rebuild route because of the $$$--they
&gt; haven't given me a price yet. They said they would pull the engine and try
&gt; and determine the source of the problem and then give me a better idea of
&gt; what I'm looking at. I'm going to talk to them tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt; So, what should I ask? Is it reasonable that the bus ran fine, was towed
&gt; here, I replaced the ignition switch, it wouldn't start, was towed there,
and
&gt; now needs a new engine?? I guess stranger things have happened when it
comes
&gt; to VWs :~)
&gt;
&gt; Any advice appreciated. I really don't know what to do from here. I've
&gt; started doing some work on my 65 Bug, but no engine work per se (well, I
did
&gt; pull the carb and replace it). Mostly brakes, fuel lines, etc.)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks all...and hello to the other women on the list especially, it's
nice
&gt; to know we're out there too.
