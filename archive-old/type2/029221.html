Lessee, my guess is that it was designed by the same fool that located the
fuel tank tie down nuts in such an easily accessible place.  It also
requires a $300 tool to properly secure it even though an $.08 nut would
have done the same job.  It's the nut used to hold the bracket that the
rear bench seat bolts on to which is only accessible when you pull the fuel
tank.
