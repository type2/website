hello list

i found that the rubber connections in the manifold needs replacing, all 4 
of them.

who sells it and how hard is to replace?

my engine is a type4 (pancake) with a single carb. i believe (not sure) it 
was originally a dual carb. but PO changed it to a single one.

as always all the thanks in the world in advance,

luiszo
