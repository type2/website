I have never seen a hinge o a '70 without a pin.  Chances are that it is
in there but so corroded to the hinge that you cannot see it clearly. 
Unless you are seeing a hole where the pin was.  It is quite an operation
to fix these because they have to be drilled out.  And you cannot do that
without removing the assembly.  The screws tend to be almost a corroded
as the pin.  You can find replacement screws at HD if you have to
drill/tap them out.

Whomever has the '71 van in Annapolis, i may be interested here in DC.
