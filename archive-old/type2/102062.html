Bill,  

Not necessarily true. If the engine is factory original, or built to
original specs, it has gaskets between the cylinder tops and the heads. Most
gasket sets include these gaskets, even though they are no longer specified.
In fact, head gaskets seem to make the heads LEAK, rather than stopping this
from occurring. The way to stop leakage here is to have the heads cut with a
step and lap the cylinders into the heads before assembly. Copper head
gaskets also work I am told.

I would ask the question of the original poster - why do you need, or think
you need, to replace the head gaskets?
