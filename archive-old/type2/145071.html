&gt; Is the unit for the SVDA distributor the same as the unit for the 009?  I
&gt; Googled up the install instructions and it mentions VW 009, magnetic, and

I have held off on purchasing this unit because of the same thing. I
could never find anything that would confirm or deny that it would or
would not fit in a vacuum distributor. I read a few posts that seemed
to indicate the theory that the vacuum can arm would get in the way,
but like I said could find nobody that had actually given it a try.
 
&gt; The price, at ~$135 for both breakerless ignition and CDI module seems
&gt; pretty reasonable.

I thought so as well. mabey someone will pipe up.
