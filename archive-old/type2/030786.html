WOW!  

Overwhelming response, folks.

I have been informed that 5-7 yards is enough to do the whole shebang,
including jump seat, z-bed, camp stool, and rear cushion.

Therefore 10 yards will be overkill, and I will be able to accomodate more
people without tracking down more of the stuff.  There's still a few
orders of it not accounted for.

I am also on the hunt for the &quot;Monkey Vomit&quot; flavor as well as the elusive
platinum tint.  Stay tuned.
