I'm a Network Administrator, MIS/IT Director, Software Engineer, 
Help Desk, Webmaster, &amp; Computer Training Guy- In other words- 
I'm the only Technical person for a wholesale apparel company with 
several offices.
After the can of worms I get into at work a well engineered german 
toy is a great way to unwind.- The Westy is also an integral part of 
my personal Y2K plan for survival 8^)
Reading this thread brought me back to the old days-- Joel- what 
happened to the stats?
