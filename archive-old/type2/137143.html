&gt;I'm no Type 1 expert but don't those mexican blocks have 9mm rocker arms.

Apologies all 'round. Just got off the phone with Gene Berg company and 
they said that 1. Brazilian rockers DO have 9mm, 2. GB does not make 
swivel feet for 9mm threads.

And despite what I said earlier in this thread, I obviously MUST have a 
9mm tap, since I used it to chase out one of the rockers that felt tight.

So I reckon that if I want to use these swivel feet, I'll need to use my 
old engine's rockers with their more common M8 (in the USA, anyway) thread.
