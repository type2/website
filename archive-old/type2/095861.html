Subject: mahle filters

I dunno,

Something about the cold, calculating DM'ness of Doktor Tim makes the engineer in me's eyes water. There's something akin to the zen mindset of doing household chores here. They're not chores, they're just what you do, no more, no less.

The masochist in me enjoys the way in which he tells me I'm F'ing something up and my cylinders are gonna crumple if I don't honor the German automotive deceased.

So when he (and others) opened my eyes to the oil filter quality situation, I got on board right away. Figured I'd get a fourpack from Ron for 12 bucks. Plug plug.

Then I was cruising the Ebarf and scored (I think) four mahle filters, plus, good readers, plus, a socket to spin them in with (95mm was it?) for 9.99 provided none of you other slimeballs bid on it, which you didn't. The price almost doubled with the shipping but I think it's still a good deal with the socket included. 

What I want to know is, is 'oc-28' the correct Mahle # for the filters, or did I get sprayed?

Yours in Deutch Method,

Billy
