Remember the '69 JBL van that was won via  some contest???

The talk was that it had about $10,000 worth of restoration, and $10,000
worth of stereo components.

I saw it at a Manassas Bug Out a few years back, in the parking_lot
field across the street from the show.  It looked nice.

I saw it a year ago in Northern Virginia, and  I saw it just last Friday
at a VW shop in Annandale (Fairfax) Virginia.

I expect that it is for sale, as it was for sale the previous times I
ran across it.

This would be a 'boss' setup for a traveling rock band!!  Blow them away
&gt;from mid-field with your multi-multi watt amps!!!

Oh, well, I am going back to the shop tomorrow morning to de-tune my
Westy, so that it runs rich again (needed to pass emissions) before I
take my trip from Virginia to Maryland (Eric Forsman &amp; lacrosse camp for
my daughter) to Pennsylvania (Ron??) to Atlantic City New Jersey (beach
and beer time) and back home via Maryland (pick up daughter).  I will
leave Virginia Monday 5 July, return Friday 9 July.

Anybody in Atlantic City NJ??

Anybody want info on the '69 JBL van???
