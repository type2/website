&gt; SIR was a VW engine rebuilder, somewhere in the southwest if memory
&gt; serves me correctly. If I'm not mistaken they went out of business a
&gt; couple of years ago. I don't know much about the quality of their work.

Just some arcana,

If you have the wilson rebuild book, most of the photos in that book showing
engine parts are taken at the SIR facility. They were a BIG outfit, along
the lines of GEX.
