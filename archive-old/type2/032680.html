Subject: Probably in the archives, But:

I have a 1982 Aircooled westie. I have purchased various parts to re-do the
brakes, axles, and shock aborbers in the rear. Today, I finally managed to
get the right rear brake drum off. The shoes look OK and I found the
Emergency Brake cable had come off the nipple where it is supposed to hook
(which explains why my E Brake has been so anemic). After cleaning out the
brake drum with cleaner and refitting everything together, I took it for a
test ride and noticed my brake pedal bottoms out. It will pump up after
repeated tries and give good braking. Does this mean the hydraulics need to
be bled? It seems odd because I didn't touch the rear brake cylinder at
all. I did adjust the star wheel a bit to get the E brake cable on and
adjusted. 

Good news is, I finally got the #$%#^_at_%# axle nuts loosened. It took two
adults, a 5 Lb sledge hammer, and axle nut &quot;flogging spanner&quot; and a 1/2&quot;
breaker bar to finally crack the axle nuts. I am sure the right rear wheel
bearing is messed up because of the noises it makes when the wheel is
rotated. another list member suggested that it was just a brake shoe
dragging.... but this noise persists when the brake drum is off.... Now
that the axle nuts are cracked open, I have placed the vehicle's rear end
up on axle stands and will proceed to rebuild each one in turn. 

Any wisdom and/or tips from the list on the rear axle rebuild? any opinions
on the mysterious soggy break pedal? 

			TIA
