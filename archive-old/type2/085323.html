Subject: RE: [T2] VW CD's??

I will let you know, I just bought one. It has not come in yet. I may be
willing to burn a few copies if it turns out to be any good. For the price
of the CD and shipping of course.

Subject: [T2] VW CD's??


It appears that someone has gotten their hands on &quot;official&quot; VW parts manual
software on CD and is selling these on ebarf.

Does anyone know if these are being widely distributed and how legit they
are?

Just curious- I am surprised that VWOA doesn't already have a team of
lawyers on their case
