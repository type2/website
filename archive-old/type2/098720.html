Subject: 70 westy bed ~ sheet size

is the westy bed (1970) any particular sheet size or do i need to alter
or make my own? i thought my kids' sheets would fit, but they are too
narrow, so it cant be &quot;twin&quot;. i thought someone once said normal sheets
would fit, so it must be &quot;full size&quot;, right? if &quot;full&quot; are the right
width, will i still have to alter the length? i was thinking of making a
corner cushion to fill in the spare tire hole and take in the sheet
corner to fit that angle.

thanks!
chris
