Subject: Re: how to hook-up ammeter/voltmeter?

Hi Rick,

The volt meter is easy any ignition controled live will do, but
preferably one that is electricaly 'close' to the battery / charging 
system - say directly from the switched side of the ignition.

An Ammeter is a bit more work. the cable size required will be at least
the size that exists between the alternator and the starter.

The instructions to put the ammeter between the alternator and the 
battery is rather glib, even misleading / wrong. (I am assuming a normal
vechicle ammeter with a central needle, + amps to the right, and - amps 
to the left)

The existing wiring looks like this (simplified a bit)

                        fuse box
                          |
                          |
     alternator---------- | ----------battery
                        | | |
                       starter

All 3 wires go to the same terminal on the starter.

The position of the ammeter is critical.
   - it must not measure the starting current (its beyond the range of 
     the meter)
   - it should measure all other drain from the battery
   - it should measure any charge given to the battery
   - it does not measure the current produced by the alternator 
     (although high/low current from the alternator may be infered)

In use the ammeter works like this:-
     After starting the needle will deflect to the + side of the ammeter
     showing how much current is being put back into the battery. This
     will gradualy reduce to zero. If the needle deflects to the - side
     of the ammeter then you are useing more amps than the alternator is
     producing.

So where do you put it?

                      fuse box
                        |-------ammeter---
                        |                |
     alternator----------                | ----------battery
                                         | |
                                       starter

What to do:-

DISCONNECT THE BATTERY

take the alternator and fuse box wires off of the starter and join them
together and insulate.

where the power comes in to the fuse box connect another heavy wire to
the same terminal on the fuse box and take it to the ammeter.

Take a heavy wire from the other side of the ammeter to the terminal on 
the starter where you left the wire that goes to the battery.

If you have anything except the starter connected to the battery transfer 
it to the power out on the alternator (the wire that used to go to the
starter) so that its current will be metered.

Reconnect the battery

turn the lights on - ammeter should deflect to the - side. If it deflects 
to the + side then disconnect the battery and swop the heavy wires on the 
ammeter over then reconnect the battery again.

start the engine, during cranking ammeter will deflect to the - side 
showing the current used by the starter solenoid (but not by the 
100s amps used by the starter motor), when running ammeter deflects to 
the + side and returns to 0

Job done:-)

The above is particular to a loaf. But the princibles are correct for
every vehicle ever made.
As you can see 'between alternator and battery' is way too glib, they
should be shot at dawn for instructions like that.
