Subject: Re: [T2] brake booster

Jamie,

What is the possibility that the hose part that is supposed to allow
incoming outside air to the booster is plugged.

Couldn't find a picture and it's been a few months since I did mine.

If the booster can't suck some outside air someplace, then it's going to 
have to try and suck past the seal in the master cylinder.

10-20psi of suction all the time is going to make something give 
somewhere.

Remember the post where someone had ice/snow blocking theirs?

Cheers ,dave

&gt; question is:
&gt; 
&gt; What would make a power brake system fill the booster with fluid, and pull the
&gt; pedal to the floor on it's own?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This bus has a history ... the first time this happened the [say original, who
&gt; knows] booster and master cylinder were replaced with a rebuilt one... worked
&gt; for about 2 years , it repeated itself.
&gt; 
&gt; Booster fills with fluid [I thought it was brake fluid, in fact I am sure it is
&gt; brake fluid] 
&gt; Brake pedal pulls itself to the floor when the engine is running
&gt; 
&gt; That rebuilt booster and master was replaced with a &quot;fresh off a scrapped bus
&gt; with working brakes&quot; known good used master and booster,,  this situation worked
&gt; for about a year
&gt; 
&gt; Now, 1 year later , that used booster is full of fluid , and sucks the pedal to
&gt; the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; Each time, the &quot;customer&quot; complains that he never had to ever add fluid to the
&gt; reservoir, even though about 2 liters spill out of the booster
&gt; 
&gt; Vac check valve seems to work when tested
&gt; The inside of the rebuilt booster was full of rust,,, leading me to believe the
&gt; fluid was actually water... or mostly water,, 
&gt; could the vent be sucking in water?
&gt; 
&gt; so:
&gt; ??? All of them have deteriorated so they leak enough fluid past the master into
&gt; the booster?
&gt; 
&gt; Could this fluid come from somewhere else?
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think causes this???
