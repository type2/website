Subject: This type II list is driving me CRAZY!
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Everyone,

For two days I have been trying to post a note inquiring about a donor Bus 
and attaching a link for you guys to view my 71 crew cab pictures but the 
list has been sending it back to me.  What's the deal?

Dave
