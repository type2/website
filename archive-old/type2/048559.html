Subject: [T2] For Sale?

Hello,

    I am new to the list and i was wondering if anyone knows of or has a 
1965-1976 VW bus for sale in or near the Miami(Florida) area? The only 
criteria i have is that it runs well and has little to no rust, the interier 
could have been attacted be a bear, just as long as there's somewhere to sit. 
I appreciate all of your help and await your reply.

Thanks in advance,
Christopher Johnson
