Subject: [T2] How long should it take for f.i. to start the engine?

My new 79 Westy seems to take at least 2 to 3 tries of 15-20 seconds
cranking before it will finally start. I was under the impression that it
should start on the first try in a couple of seconds? My 78 certainly did ,
this one requires too much cranking in my opinion. Any comments on this, or
am I asking too much?
Thanks,
Courtney
