Subject: goodies list

Hi all - got the goodies list from my friend Louis today. I will email
those with specific requests this week; will try to post the whole shebang
to the List by friday. Its not as long as I thought, but then he tended to
squeeze things together, ie, &quot;many 6v generators, some German some not;
call.&quot; Lots of neat stuff.
