Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon seat belts into baywindow - pics?

Hello List,

I was wondering. These retractable belts are a great
addition to any bus but I have a question. My bus is
not a walk through. It has the 2/3 and 1/3 bench seat
in the front.Can I use these same retractable belts?
Would the passanger side belt be long enough??? Any
thoughts? 

Thanks!

&gt; Someone recently asked me once how much does the
&gt; belt come out when
&gt; installed down in the original hole. In order words
&gt; could a larger person
&gt; secure the belt? I measured and it seems if your
&gt; belly can clear the
&gt; steering wheel you'll be ok mounting the belt lower
&gt; down.
