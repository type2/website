Subject: Buses Of The Corn 2005 Pre-Registration: 2 days to go...

Hi Volks,

If you want to save some cash on your BOTC registration fees you now  
have only two more days to post payment at the reduced rate of $18  
for the whole weekend. The fee at the gate will be $25/weekend, or  
$15 for a single night.

Yes, it's more expensive than years past. We're improving the on-site  
services* and door prizes this year and hope to make a profit to  
benefit the services at www.type2_dot_com.

For more information please visit www.busesofthecorn_dot_com, or email me.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
