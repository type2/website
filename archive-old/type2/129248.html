Subject: Re: [T2] Whats the secret for removing push rod tubes??

I grabbed mine with some pliers wrapped in cloth.  Then, I tapped on the 
  side of the pliers to pull the tube out of the engine.  You can also 
use the pliers twist the tube first.  Also, try some wd40 to loosen them 
up before going at it.

The key is grabbing them with something firmly that won't mar or crush them.

&gt; the seals, a few of the push rod tubes practically
&gt; fell out when I removed the rocker arms, but another
&gt; few are being very difficult!!! So anyone have any
&gt; tips on removing stubborn push rod tubes from a 2 liter??
