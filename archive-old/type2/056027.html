Subject: Re:EGR update 

Dear Terry,

Your situation is perplexing. I once briefly owned a 1979 Westfalia. I only
had it 4 months before I wrecked it and this was my first bus about 6 years ago
so memory is hazy. I did pass smog in CA, so it probably had any required 
equipment.

Then I bought my current ride, a '78 Westfalia. The first thing I remember about
looking in the engine compartment was, &quot;Hey, what's THAT?&quot; and seeing the
unfamiliar silver pipe going to the EGR valve. So I think the '79 didn't have
one. Maybe other folks can confirm whether EGR is stock on '79 CA Westfalias.
If so, you're shopping for some expensive parts. Or maybe trying to make
the engine stock 1980, in which case (as I understand CA smog law) you would
have to pass smog standards for a 1980 engine. Good to check out options for
crossing the smog minefield before spending your hard-earned bread to get 
there.

On 1978 bus, the EGR pipe bolts to the EGR filter through three holes in the
left side tin, near the back of the piece. Two holes for the bolts and one for
the gas to pass through. Does your left side engine tin have these holes? There
should also be a place to bolt the EGR filter to the exhaust system, on the
front side of the place where it makes a U-turn and goes to the catalytic 
converter (close to where the O2 sensor would go in a '79 or later bus).
If you have no EGR system, this spot is probably welded shut somehow, but it
should be there. You'll also be un-stoked to learn that a new EGR filter costs
$80 or so from VW.

I did have trouble with rough idle (almost no idle), overly lean mix early in my
'78's career. Problem was loose bolts holding on the intake manifolds to the
heads on one side. Air was leaking in, making for lean mix. Tightening bolts
that hold on the intake manifolds to spec torque solved the problem. One more
thing to check, and one that can be done with engine in place.

I've had other useful experiences with the EGR system and passing smog on my
'78 so let me know if you want to know more gory details.

Good luck,
Surfer Bob
