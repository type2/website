Both my 73's have single 2 barrel carbs.  One is an Holly and the other is a
Weber.  From what I've seen of others busses with stock carbaration, I wish
mine was stock.  Correct me if I'm wrong but, you should have the dual
carbs.  With this set up, correctly adjusted, each side will be getting the
fuel it needs.  With the single two barrel it seems that you can never get it
adjusted just right.  Personally if I had the money right now I would go with
fuel injection.

&gt;
&gt; Hi everyone, I am new to this list. My bus is '72
&gt; Westfalia. The question I have is this: Is there an
&gt; intake manifold that would allow the adaptation of a
&gt; single 2 bbl carb? has anyone out there had any
&gt; experience with such a setup and would you reccommend it
&gt; or not?
