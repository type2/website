Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding Door Lock Adjustment?

Maybe Karl can chime in here...  I think I remember this from replacing
my cable thingie piece...  If you don't get it in there with the right
config, it does as you describe.  Beyond that I don't remember detail -
I ended up letting my live-in fix it, it was so frustrating.  Probably
has to do with the position of the lock when you reassemble, or an
incorrect position of something...

Sorry I can't be of more assistance.  I don't think it's necessarily
broken, tho'.

Teri
