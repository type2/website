Subject: RE: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

On the topic of plugs, I have been running Bosch W7CCO in my 78 westy FI.
This recommendation came from a long time VW mechanic friend.  The car seems
to run a bit better, and rev a little freer.  It might just be me, but it
really seemed better.  Anyone else runing these?
