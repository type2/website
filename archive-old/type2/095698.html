Subject: fuel line replacement help!

guys and gals,

A local euro-house is sourcing me some metric fuel line for a complete replacement.

I know this is all in the archives but I have a hard time with the archives, can we do a archive faq one of these days?

1. Karl, how about those MB partnumbers?

112-476-12-26 for 10MM?

what is the 7MM?

2. The guy has described the new hose as being plastic and shiny. That doesn't sound like rubber to me. What's up?

3. I told him 1 meter of the 7MM, is that enough?

4. The filler hose is about 2 1/4&quot; I.D. correct?

Thanks y'all.

Billy
