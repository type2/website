Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust questions.


&gt; I have a 1978 champagne edition westy w/ very bad exhaust.  I am going to
&gt; convert to the 72-75 stock system.  I already have the heat exchangers and
&gt; some sort of valves (black and look like elbows w/ a vent thing on one end)
&gt; I have the stock system coming from bus depot.
&gt;
&gt; Do I need anything else?  gaskets, tubing, bolts, anything?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your help...also will this system and the heat exchangers bolt
&gt; right into my stock 78 engine, or will any modifications need to be made?

You will need a few more parts to make this work correctly:
Both front lower cylinder tin.
Both lower tin.
Both air tubes that go thru the upper cylinder tin to the boxes.
The 72-74 alt support.
