These are good questions Shawn.  I hope you'll get some good answers.
Here's as much as I know:

&gt;Question #1.
&gt;How do I determine the proper camshaft gear pitch?

I've not seen a definitive procedure for this.  The best suggestion I've
read (somewhere) is to have a bunch of old cams with different gears, or an
assortment of gears you can bolt onto a one camshaft handy--then see what
works.  Not really practical for the occasional engine build, I know.  I
like geometry, but I don't like dealing with problems of hidden angles
working in little places--messes with my head ;).

I have a vague recollection of something I read regarding taking a cam gear
that's close, installing the cam w/ crank/cam gears in place in an old case
and spinning it with a motor with lapping compound on the gear teeth to get
the gears to mate better. I'm not sure if that's to solve &quot;backing out&quot; when
no gear seems to work well and you're trying to get the closest one to fit,
or if it's a fine tuning thing for optimum mating of a gear that meshes well
in the first place.  Sounds messy anyway and of course don't try anything
like that until you get confirmation from some more sources.  Check the
archives or Hoover CD maybe--I know I didn't read that in a book.

&gt;Question #2.
&gt;Is there any truth to the stories of the new camshafts of questionable
&gt;origin going flat?  If so, where can I get a suitable STOCK cam?

I read a report on this in a Berg newsletter a year or so back.  Apparently
the problem they've noticed and subsequently researched is sporadic and
across manufacturers, so it's luck of the draw.  I think they offer some
service where they grind a NEW camshaft, harden it or treat it somehow and
perhaps break it in by running before selling it to you!!  If you're
interested, I'll dig up the newsletter article on the topic and post it.
When I rebuilt I ended up buying a stock Mahle cam from them with a gear
attached that matched my original (-1).  Although I had my case align bored
(which could easily change the gear required), I crossed my fingers and it
passed the &quot;backing out&quot; test, so I was lucky and didn't have to worry about
your first question for my rebuild.

I'll CC this to Type2 for comments/corrections.

Good luck,

Ron
