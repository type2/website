Subject: The 248K mi engine run with TUFOIL  disassembled report

This is re the 78 camper of ours which had original drivetrain (tranny 
too) even up to 248K miles, using the PTFE/moly additive its whole life 
after 65K mi.   The game became &quot;How far will it go before something 
goes?&quot;  In its life, the engine only had a clutch replaced and a set of 
hydraulic lifters and fuel pump, thermostat, and usual seals.  Now I can 
admit the fuel lines in the FI were original except for tank to pump and 
pressure regulator. They were checked plenty, but seemed flexible with 
no cracks.
   However, nagging oil leaks, low oil pressure (15 when hot and doing 
55 mph) and &quot;silvery&quot; flakes on the oil screen prompted me to decide to 
have the 78 camper engine pulled- a lot on the bus was original and 
needed replacing/reworking -ball joints, steering lever bushing,  brake 
cylinders, tired rear suspension, rear wheel bearings, etc.  Compression 
was still even (110-130) but power up hills required a gear lower, and I 
had to drive slower to keep oil temp at 240 or less.  Coulda gone 
another 50K likely, but no one in the family wanted to go more than a 
weekend's worth in distance!
    Well, it is apart, and overall, Jon said it had the wear of a 100K 
engine- rod and main bearings look good, showing nice gray all over, the 
case is better than the spare I was keeping; the heads are not cracked 
(but he wants to use new for a ten year life expectancy as I'm 62 now- 
anyone suggest rebuilding the old ones?).  Years of stuff in the head 
fins likely caused it to run hotter, as well as a tired oil pump.
What caused the flakes and loss of power was a tired cam and worn out 
cam bearings that looked like someone chewed out pieces in their center!
Possibly the lifter change at 100K mi had an effect on the lobe wear. 
Pic of bearings sent on request.  He said my style of driving likely 
kept it from overheating, and I never drove it floored up a hill without 
shifting down after 5-10 sec.  Did TUFOIL help?  It reduces friction (my 
mpg went up by 3 on first use) and certainly did not hurt.  About $500 
was spent on TUFOIL in 178K miles- worth it I'd say, as I avoided a 
typical rebuild after my first 10 years of driving.
