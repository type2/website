&gt; Hello Everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; I am new to the list, this is my first posting. But here goes. I have 2
&gt; questions about my brothers '73 Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. It has an automatic tranny that I think is going out. It is hitting
&gt; pretty hard when it shifts. Sometimes when I put it in drive, it just spins
&gt; for awhile before it goes into gear and at high speeds it wont always shift
&gt; until the rpms are to high. Anyway, is there anything I can do other than
&gt; put a new transmission in, if not where can I get a good one.

two things to check.

. check tranny fluid, and make sure the filter is clean.
. the 73 tranny has a vacuum shifter and there is a vacuum line off the
side of the tranny, check to make sure it is not leaking, (Replace with
vacuum hose)
