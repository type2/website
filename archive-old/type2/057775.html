I saw several crossovers and elbows for '79s at Interstate auto parts in
Vista CA when I was there a couple days ago looking for a '76 crossover.
They can fix you up, but all they do is VWs and they know the value of
the parts.

Seems like you could go to a fabricator and get a crossover made up for
way, way less that $600.
