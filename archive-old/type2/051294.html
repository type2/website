&gt;I have a BN2 heater and I just installed a never used

Are you the one that outbid me for that plug on E-b-a-y??  Grrr... :-)
Anyway I can tell you one thing, if you jumper 12V to that expensive glow plug for more than a second it will burn out.  I will NEVER do that again, and I'd advise you not to either.  If it won't light, it is likely a fuel problem.
