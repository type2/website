Subject: Re: [T2] How do modern cars do it ?

&gt;Recently I had a courtesy car while my bug was in for repair (Van off the
&gt;road at the same time - just my luck) but it was interesting to compare the
&gt;two. The new car was very quiet inside but not acousticly dead. I guess I
&gt;can put loads of soundproofing in and get somewhere near here. A new Type 2
&gt;(yes we have them in the UK :-) ) seems to acieve this in camper trim. More
&gt;importanly though, the new car always seemed DRY inside. I don't mean either
&gt;the bug or bus has pools of water in but on a damp day they do seem damp
&gt;inside.
&gt;Now new cars don't have de-humidifiers in them and my seals are excellent
&gt;but I wonder if it is down to the heating system pushing out dry heat rather
&gt;than our wet heat, better condensation control or magic ?
&gt;How can I replicate this on a van ? Can I ? I didn't use the heat on the car
&gt;so I don't see how it can be this. Is it just my imagination ?

To the contrary, new cars do have de-humidifiers in them. The air 
conditioning works quite effectively as a de-humidifier, and is 
usually engaged automatically when you select defrost/demist. Also, 
new cars have better insulation, better door seals, and they've got 
body exhausters, which promote better ventilation. One of the 
problems with the heat system in a bus is that even when you fix all 
the leaks, the incoming heat has nowhere to go. Opening a window can 
help, but the real fix would be to locate exhausters in a negative 
pressure area. Exhausters are essentially one way valves. All new 
cars have them, and they are usually located under the rear bumper 
cover surround, in or around the tail lights, or, on some cars, under 
a grille (that seems to be decorative) along the rear sides of the 
car. They are crucial to proper climate control.

Installing a modern climate control system in a bus would be pretty 
difficult, but not impossible. You'd need to do some experimentation 
to find the right place for body exhausters, and re-work the heating 
and ventilation system considerably.
