Subject: Re: seats for my 68
Content-Disposition: inline

Hello again!
  I appreciate the feed back about the front seats in my newly aquired Bus. Unfortunately, the seats the PO put in are not in very good condition now. I do see your point about the comfort (or lack thereof) of low-back seats. Maybe I'll put in some seats from Scat...
  I'm not really going for show quality, I just want a very clean daily driver that will go any distance.

Peace &amp; Harmony,
James Starr, 68 Std.
