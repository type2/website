&gt;Yes, it can be done. In fact, I did it in a motel parking lot once. You

&gt;Getting the hub off without the VW tool can be difficult; the best thing
&gt;to do is to have a pulley or some other robust metal disk drilled with
&gt;three holes so that you can bolt it to the hub, then pull with a puller.

I would like to stress that you definately don't want to use a puller on
the ears of the hub directly.  You will just bend the ears and then you're
in an even deeper mess.  The A/C pulley is also not strong enough to use.
I would want something made of 1/4&quot; steel as the hub can really be
difficult to remove.
