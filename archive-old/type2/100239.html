Subject: How do Retractable Seatbelts Lock?

My theory:

There is a small ball bearing that sits dead center in the retractable 
portion of the seat belt.

As long as the seat belt retractable portion is 100% straight up and down, 
you are good to go.

If the seat belt retractable portion is any way off the straight up and down 
position (this is the best technical term I can come up with right now), the 
belt can be pulled and retracted via the built in spring (Man, not the 
dreaded 'built in spring' again!!)

But when you brake, the ball bearing slides off center and locks the seat 
belt retractable portion.

You probably could experience the same effect with a hard right or left turn 
off the freeway ramp.

So, when you are doing one of these daredevil exits off the freeway, lean 
forward slightly and see if the belt is locked up.  And if it is not, try to 
make the exit at a faster speed and a more severe turn, just up to the 
limits of your tires/shocks/sway bar and passenger's nerves!!

You can call me from the hospital at 614 555 1212 to let me know if I was 
right.

Oh, yes, and that part of the seat belt retractable portion that says 'do 
not remove' means that if you DO REMOVE it, you will free up the 'built in 
spring' which can never, ever be rewound and put back into the housing, 
particularly by someone that now has only 9 of 10 working digits.  But you 
WILL get to see the ball bearing in question.  Curiosity and cats and boxes 
and Pandora's et al.

I mean, everyone's going to do that once, right??
