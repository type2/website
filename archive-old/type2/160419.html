Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor for electronic ignition

Hi Karl -
Impressive! It seems you're quite famous for being able to find hard-to-find
parts :) Would you be willing to sell one of your distributors to me?

Jim asked, &quot;You never indicated why you need one.  Is yours shot, missing or
????&quot;
My mechanic (I had to stop working on the bus myself for a while, when my
now-5-month-old son was born) told me that the vacuum advance was shot, and
that the timing wasn't advancing. He recommended replacing the whole
package, rather than simply the vacuum element of it. I'll chat to him
tomorrow to get more information.

I'll check for the part number that you mentioned as well.

Thanks all of you for your help! You've really made my day with all of this
information :)
Mike.

&gt; So from your pages, I need to find either of:
&gt; VW 039-905-205C or Bosch 0237 022 009Does anyone on
&gt; the list have any tips
&gt; on where to find one? Googling the part numbers
&gt; doesn't bring up much
&gt; info...
&gt;
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; I have a bunch of them. At one time I was putting
&gt; together and selling a drop-in swap kit to convert any
&gt; bus type 4 engine over factory electronic ignition.
&gt; But I ran into a problem finding good used harness's
&gt; between the module and the coil. Age gets to the 3
&gt; wire plug where the wire insulation enters the plug.
&gt; So I have about a dozen or more dizzys and modules,
&gt; but no harness's worth a darn....
&gt; I gave up picking up the dizzys from the yards lately.
