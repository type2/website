Hello all,

 Plan are now being made for the first annual Josh Rodgers Memorial Beer
Bash and Campout. As of right now, the location to meet is probably going
to be the Turner Falls Campground in Davis, Oklahoma.  This event is open
to everyone, no matter if you knew him or not. For those of you who didn't
know him, he was an extremely generous gentleman who loved beer and buses!!

 I'm looking at weekend of 18/19 September to hold this event. I also need
to know how many would come to this event to set up space in the
campground. If you are interested, please e-mail me instead of replying to
the list. 

 More information will follow as the date gets closer.
