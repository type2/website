Subject: Re: [T2] 70 bus ignition

Hiya Ron,

Anything you find out there will almost certainly be aftermarket parts.  
Beware!  They are shoddy goods at best.  You are MUCH better off by going out to a 
boneyard and finding a 1970 with its original 887A lock housing.  You can 
remove the keylock from that unit OR do a little rehabbing (read:  disassemble, 
clean, lube, reassemble) and have a unit specifically made for your 
application.  And, by the way, if you do a little routine maintenance on the 887A it will 
last forever.  The thing is durn near bulletproof.

If you should need any further assistance, please don't hesitate to zap an 
e-mail my way.  I had to go through the intricacies of the 1970 ignition lock a 
couple of years ago and I learned two rather startling facts.  1.  The 887A is 
not listed in VW parts records (isn't that correct, Karl?).  No references to 
servicing this unit now exist (as far as I can determine).  2.  The online 
reference sources for rehabbing the ignition in a baywindow will not get you 
through doing an 887A.

Good luck!  I know all of this doesn't sound encouraging, but remember, if I 
could get through this, you can too.
