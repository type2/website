Subject: [T2] heat exchangers

Well i'm almost at the end of my rope. Im trying to install an original
german right side 72-74 heat exchanger from the busdepot ( i love those
guys) on my 78 westy and cant get it onto the cylinder head. even with
the studs remove the exchanger will not mate to the head (ps i purchased
new studs and they seem loose in the holes is this acceptable?) i am
going nuts, my head is marked AMC so i know its not german.  I ground
some of the side of the pipe of the heat exchanger to see if it was just
abit to large..no help. I don't drive my bus when the roads are salted
but i would like heat and as i live in boston its getting cold already
so i need to get my j tubes off  and these exchangers on. By the way as
soon as i get the exchangers on the j tubes are for sale i paid $300 for
them last summer and they have only 5000 miles of summer driving on
them..so if anyone's interested ill let you know when the exchangers are
on.i havent tried the junkyard one from wayout salvage yet, but i made
sure i didn't get dansk parts to avoid the problem i now face. im
getting close to bringing my bus to the local vw specialist to have them
deal with the problem but i don't like other people working on my car.
PLEASE HELP!!
thanks
jamie
