Hi Volks,

 Hoo boy, tyres again.. :-)

 I think there's a lot of confusion, partly because tyre ratings are
 being &quot;improved&quot; continuously. This is my current understanding of the
 situation. As always, corrections are invited, preferably public-
 polite would be nice :-).

 (1) Crossplies were rated by the number of plies in the tyre, defining
 strength and stiffness- hence Type-2s require a 6-ply or 8-ply rated tyre.
 Nowadays, this is usually a Radial construction tyre equivalent by
 some magic formula to the corresponding crossply.

 (2) Truck tyres carry load range specifications which define their
 ability to support load. We use load range &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot;, both of which
 are adequate. I don't know what the actual definitions refer to and
 note with interest that Kumho, for one example, has a 185R14 tyre
 available rated at load range &quot;C&quot; and a 185R14C version rated at load
 range &quot;D&quot;. I assume that a 185R14C would normally be/have been &quot;C&quot; rated
 but that improvements in tyre technology actually allow higher loads.
 This is a guess.

 (3) Car tyres are speed rated and may be reinforced. A reinforced
 passenger car tyre is probably adequate for a bus but may not be
 suitable for a fully loaded delivery van. Your call.  Higher speed
 ratings usually correspond to a stiffer sidewall and may provide you
 with adequate support, however availability in suitable sizes is
 limited and they may not be strong enough to take recommended
 inflation pressures (36-44psi, at the rear).

 (4) Modern ratings use a number (weight) and a letter (speed) to give
 a load rating of the tyre. I've heard that 97R is appropriate for a
 vanagon- 97=1609 lbs and R=106mph so this seems like a plausible
 rating. I don't have an equivalent rating for a Baywindow bus but I
 would guess that  you could get by with a bit less, say 95(1521 lbs)
 or 96(1565 lbs). The speed rating is unlikely to be an issue for a
 stock bus... :-). The 8-ply rated 185R14C tyres I was looking at this
 morning (yes, I actually am that sad...) had a rating of 100R/102. I
 think this means 1764 lbs at 106mph or 1874lbs at some unspecified
 (but presumably defined) speed.

 (5) In the USA this is further complicated by the classification of
 tyres into Passenger car and Light Truck categories, with P and LT
 prefixes, where the rating system is different for each type. I'm sure
 this simplifies things for someone but for the owner of a European van
 trying to buy a tyre made for the European market it doesn't make life
 any easier!

 My advice is to look for:

 (1) an &quot;LT&quot; designation, with &quot;Load range C&quot; or &quot;Load range D&quot;.
 (2) the &quot;C&quot; suffix on the tyre designation- ie 185R14C _not_ 185R14
 (3) A maximum inflation pressure of 50-60psi. not 40psi
 (4) A maximum weight rating of over 1500lbs
     and/or a load index of at least 94R

 and not to trust the tyre jockeys to sell you the right thing. If they
 offer you an alternative work out for yourself what the implications
 are before buying.  This size of tyre may be unusual in the States but
 it is very common in Europe, where it is standard fit on a normal
 sized delivery van (here in the UK the VW Transporter and the Ford
 Transit pretty much define their delivery van sector, both use/used
 185R14C tyres, and &quot;light trucks&quot; are practically nonexistant). If
 they are hard to find it is because of supply problems not
 manufacturing ones.

 You can run a bus on passenger car tyres but it will handle badly,
 especially if loaded in which case the tyres may not be up to the job.
 Reinforced ones will be better and those rated as above better still.
 There are plenty of reports in the archives from people who are happy
 running passenger car tyres (and a few from those who have switched to
 tougher rubber and had a revelation). They are cheaper, at least in
 the short term.  Proper tyres will cost more (possibly a lot more) but
 will last longer (especially if you carry heavy loads or travel on bad
 roads), be safer and give better handling (cornering, crosswinds, truck
 wash, lane changes).

Cheers,
	W.
