Hi Beth,

    Not to put your Guy down, but I think I would look for a Volkswagen Tech
with a little more expertise with FI.
    Check for a vacume leak. One place, the brake booster hose'es are bad
about coming off/cracking, and it is hard to hear the &quot;hiss&quot;.
    When he checked the fuel pump, did he check for volume as well as
pressure, at the test port?
    Good luck, let us know.
