Subject: anyone need a weber progressive??? off a 1974 type II
Message-ID: &lt;b32905ce.2482a507_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

If anyone needs a used weber progressive I found one pulling some parts off a 
salvage bus.  I didn't take it cuz' i didn't need it.  If anyone else does I 
will go back and see if its still there.  I m sure I can get it for like 
under $40.  If that is worth it or you need it let me know.

* The manifold on #1,2 side is dented.  The #3,4 side is good.  Manifold 
boots look OK. 
does not have air cleaner.  

* Its a fresh bus, not been sitting out open to the rain.  Was rear-ended.  

* I suppose I could pull some little odds/ends if anyone needed. (i.e. 
lights, blinkers, seat belts, etc.) engine and tranny still in it.  

* I know its not Friday, but I just got this stuff off it on sat.  And dont 
know how long it will be there.
