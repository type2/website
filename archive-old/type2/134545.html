Subject: ignition

We had quite a discussion on these dizzies recently when I was having 
trouble with mine. It seems 009 got real popular out there because Muir 
swears by them in his book, the the long and short of the recent discussion 
here is that the vacuum advance dizzy is better for buses in power, economy 
and cooler running.

You can use the 009, and I've had 3 buses with them, but it needs to be set 
correctly for optimum use on a bus. Check where your mechanic set the 
timing. Should be about 32 BTDC at 3500 RPM, which is what the vacuum 
advance dizzy gives with its mechanical advance at full throttle when the 
vacuum advance goes away.

Starting difficulty might be incorrect timing on the 009 or carburetion 
problems.

---------------------------------

i have a 72 westy which my mechanic replaced my 050 vacuum advance dizzy w/
009 centrifugal advance dizzy.  i read the archives about how 009 are bad
for busses but most of the vw's magz, most are running 009's including
busses.  so, i have a couple questions: 1. why would my mechanic put a 009
in?  2.  why are they so popular? 3. is there anything i cant do to correct
the inherent problems w/ 009's?  all in all, my bus runs better than it did
but i do notice its power is weak until rpms are real high(when i should be
shifting).  the 050 vac adv dizzy gave me more power it seems through all
rpm ranges but couldnt hold idle(plate was bad).  im confused as to why
009's are so often used.

one last thing,  since ive owned the bus, after being driven a little and i
stop at the store or something, when i come back out, the bus is reluctant
to start.  it always starts though with some effort.  is this normal?  even
with brand new dizzy?

thanks,
patrick
