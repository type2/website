Yes, but some of our bays look somewhat less attractive than others!  And
some of my co-workers tell me often how UNattractive my vehicle is.  I
frequently leave my 73 with (original) faded orange paint and rusty wheels
(from ignoring signs on the beach at S. Padre Island, TX that said no
camping beyond this point) in grocery store parking lots completely opened
and unlocked.  $5000 worth of recent mechanicals and no one looks at it
twice.  Go figure!!

&gt;3. Behave erratically.

Somehow I've never had any trouble meeting this suggestion!!

&gt;4. Get to know everyone in your neighborhood and be a good neighbor.

With 2 old buses and a 74 914 (using the same type camouflage as my 73) my
neighbors seem to always know ME!

Sorry all (and especially to Mark whose points and observation, as always,
are well thought out and stated).  After numerous Red Hook IPA brewskis this
evening I imagine I'm finding myself more humorous than the rest of you are
likely to.
