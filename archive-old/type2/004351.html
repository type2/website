Subject: 73 transporter heater question

Volks,
I am in the middle of restoring my 73 transporter to bone-stock condition
and need to inquire to those of you that are familiar with this year model.

Will the steering box out of a 71 fit?

Also in a 71 partsmoile that a friend of mine owns, there are two heat ducts
under the rear seat...........are these supposed to be in my 73? None were
present.......

I also have a spring-loaded flap in the middle of my floor on my 73.  Right
under the middle bench.  Is there supposed to be some sort of heater vent
there?

Thanks in advance
