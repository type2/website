Subject: Electric Fuel Pumps CAUTION

I have noticed alot of talk recently about electric fuel pumps (FACET).
A word of advice:  if you use one also but a pressure regulator ($15),
and install it inline after the pump.  Often aftermarket fuel pumps
provide too much pressure to the carb, a 1600cc single carb requires
onlt 1 lb.  the facet provides 5-6 lbs..  This, in my case, caused all
the seals in gaskets in my carb to blow out and hyrdrolocked my engine
as all the excess gas leaked down into the cylinders.
