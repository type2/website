Dear Chris.

I can gain access to SW Washwiper AB website, using either of the Yahoo, 
Google or Alta Vista search engines. I checked it out again today, just to 
be sure!

URL is http://hem.passagen.se.zelus/

Make sure you set the check-boxes to any language and for countries outside 
your own.

Tell me what you think of the wash/wipers!

Regards.

Much modified and upgraded 1973 VW '1600' Type 2 Westfalia Continental


YOU SAID
&gt;
&gt;Link didn't work for me? Any ideas?

I SAID

&gt;&gt;Just a short posting to let you know about a Swedish product I have had on 
&gt;&gt;my 1973 VW Type 2, since the mid-1980s and which is now available by mail 
&gt;&gt;order, direct from the manufacturers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The SVD wash/wiper blade has a hollow rubber filler (fed by a thin rubber 
&gt;&gt;tube), with small holes at about 2 or 3 inch intervals, so that water is 
&gt;&gt;delivered to the glass, along the leading edge.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;They use very little water in comparison to standard washer jets and are 
&gt;&gt;completely unaffected by wind or vehicle speed. I thoroughly recommend 
&gt;&gt;this product!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;For illustations and details in Swedish, see the following website:-
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;http://hem.passagen.se.zelus/
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Prices are quoted in Swedish Kroner for complete kits and replacement 
&gt;&gt;rubber blade fillers. £1 Sterling = 1.4 US$ = 15 SwKr.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My Swedish friend from university originally bought some for me, at his 
&gt;&gt;local car accessory shop and more recently gets more by mail order before 
&gt;&gt;he visits me in Great Britain, if I need any.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hopefully full details of this and other windscreen wiper &amp; washer 
&gt;&gt;innovations and accessories, will be published by the British VW Type 2 
&gt;&gt;Owners' Club; either in the Technical Information Booklets or the 
&gt;&gt;bi-monthly club magazine, &quot;Transporter Talk&quot;.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Look at the rear-window washers of the modern Mercedes Vito vans for 
&gt;&gt;another interesting washer system, which is almost identical to that 
&gt;&gt;forming my 1973 VW Type 2, pantograph rear-window wiper &amp; washer system.
