&gt; Mike,
&gt;
&gt; I think it is more properly called a &quot;modesty panel&quot;...LOL!
&gt;
&gt; It is attached to the bumper and very few busses seem to have one left
&gt; after all the years.
&gt; Basically it just hides the muffler a little more from view from the rear.


Hmm,, My Camper doesn't HAVE that &quot;modesty panel&quot;, so I guess that Is why 
things are &quot;hanging&quot; out in plain view! lol  ;p

I *think* you could cut &lt;ewww butcher&gt; a small 2&quot; notch in the panel so the 
hitch tongue pinches it against the bumper if you really wanted to keep that 
panel.
the panel is #13 in this pic
