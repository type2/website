A l:  This brings up a question. I have searched the area where I live  -
Northern Virginia - and have not found a source of unusual oils like the 40
weight you recommend.  When I wanted straight 20W, as Berg recommends after
a rebuild, I had to order it from him.

Do you know of any mail order sources for motor oil?
Any chain stores where I might look?

&gt;Matt:
&gt;I think you need to change to thicker oil. Try 20w-50 or maybe straight
&gt;40 weight. In your climate, I'd recommend 40 in the summer and 20-50 in
&gt;the winter.
