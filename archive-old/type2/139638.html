Subject: RE: [T2] Only getting 11.6 mpg. Any suggestions?

Factory break-in???  LOL!
  
Andy, In the article in one of the VW mags several years ago at the Puebla
bug factory, the break-in consisted of driving it off the end of the
production line on to a dyno....where they started it up and floored it   
till the valves floated...then drove it outside to be delivered to a
customer.
  
I have always used a certain procedure over the years to help set the 
rings, but never babied it over about 100 miles....some from mile 
one....my new AVP engine had 3 miles on it when I drove my 78 Champagne
edition  50 miles away on a 100 degree day on some serious hills.

Did 60+ most of the way.  If it's not going to make it, I want to know 
now..



  
Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; &quot;You can drive your Volkswagen at full speed from the first day. There is no
&gt; break-in schedule.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; And I don't think that's because they broke them in at the factory.
&gt; Hopefully they check out the brake systems thoroughly before delivery  &lt;=o
