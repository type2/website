Subject: Tube for between the upper and lower brake reservoirs...

Is there a part number for this hard plastic tube that goes from the brake  
fluid reservoir under the driver seat to the reservoir on top of the master  
cylinder?  Ours is leaking and it's not the little plastic sleeves that are  
inside it.  The tube itself was rubbing a little bit on the frame and is  
starting to seep a little out.  
 
Could I just use some larger diameter fuel hose?   Should I go  find some 
polyethylene white/clear tubing?
 
Does brake fluid have adverse effects on either of those tube  options?
 
Anyone have any ideas for me?

This is happening on our 77 Westy.
 
Thanks!
