Yamabond is almost exactly the same as Permatex 3H, non hardening type of sealant.
However , it is expensive ,  but I hear it works well.
Hylomar is what Porsche reccomends and it also is very like Permatex 3H,just
German. The point is to use a high quality non hardening aviation grade of sealer
that is oil and gasoline proof. 3H is also butane and propane resistant and can be
used for threaded connections. Permatex ought to be paying me for this commercial.
You know the best rap on sealants Ive seen is in the How to Rebuild VW Engines
book from HP books. This is the best book Ive ever seen for step by step VW
rebuilding.
I still refer to my copy after 20 years. Rookies should own it.
