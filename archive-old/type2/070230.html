Subject: Junkyard Bussin'

I find a trip to the junkyard can be full of surprises.  For example, I'll be
walking through a row of trucks and vans to get to a bus I see in the
distance.  When I happen to glance inside a late '70's Ford van I see
pictures of a mother and her child in various settings.  It's kind of like
passing by an abandoned house when you think of all the memories that van
must have held for that family.  It gets me to thinking of all the good times
me and my brothers and sisters had driving with our mother in our breadloaf
during the early and mid '70's.

When I look into the breadloafs I think of the possible great times I'll have
in my bus once I get it exactly the way I want it.  And of course it's always
a great feeling to find a treasure in a clean early 70's bus.  Like the mint
rear view mirror I found last Saturday to replace my sun dried and yellowed
rear view mirror.  Or the near mint rear bumper I found a few weeks back.  My
ultimate find would be a chrome front VW emblem.  I have never seen a
junkyard bus with one on it yet.  If I do find one, installing in its place
after painting the bus to a stock red and white color scheme will be the
symbolic finishing of my restoration project.
