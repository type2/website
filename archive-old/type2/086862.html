&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; The check list looks good I would advise you to loose the fix-a-flat. That
&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff is really bad. It also contains flammable material which I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any feedback on &quot;Slime&quot; pre-puncture sealant...A buddy of mine uses it
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; wouldn't touch the stuff with a ten foot pole, would drive on the flat
&gt; &gt; first, it does less damage to the tire!!!!  (and I know from first hand
&gt; &gt; experience)
&gt; 
&gt; Well, tell us your experience, don't just slam the product!  How can Slime
&gt; damage a tire?  The only negatives that I've found about Slime in over a
&gt; decade of use are:

Well as many people on the list know, I use a wheelchair, my chair has
high presure tires on all wheels.  I have to go no matter what, get an
occasional flat.  sitting on the curb in my suit fixing a flat is a
bummer, so I have tried just about everything, and I have seen the inside
of the tires and tubes....it sticks to everything I have had to throw away
good tires and once a rim because that stuff would not come off so that a
new tire could seal on the rim..
