&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt;   I was looking at the owners manual again and noticed a cable running

Scott:
This was used on 68-69 type II's and was replaced in 1970, I beleive,
with a thermostatic valve. My original 69 air cleaner had it and it went
from the flapper valve linkage in front of the fan housing to the
flapper in the air cleaner. I wonder how many of these are still intact?
I changed mine to a 71 air cleaner- makes servicing the air cleaner lots
easier! Probably not legal in New Jersey!
