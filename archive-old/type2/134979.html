Subject: [T2] Cylinder Head Paint

Let's get to the real issue here.

&gt;&gt;I'm doing the top end on my 75 and was going to give the cylinders a
&gt; coat of paint.


It's not about paint its about the heads and what might happen to the bottom
 end of this motor after a fresh coat of paint and new rings?

These heads are available new with a great warranty and improved seat
design. Should yours be replaced? Is the bottom end of your motor worthy of
renewed compression? You should at least have them cleaned  and inspected at
a shop. This will cost you next to nothing or nothing. The most important
 thing here is cleanliness. This is for airflow and how it is related to
cooling.

 Just a thought.
