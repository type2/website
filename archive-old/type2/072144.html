Are you a camper?  Do you enjoy camping smelling like a Neanderthal?  Then
this may not be for you.  But if you enjoy a nice warm shower on a cool
night, or a cool shower after a long hot day of camping, read on.

One of the biggest gambles in camping is not knowing if where you are
camping will have clean restrooms and showers, or any at all.  I am
currently a single parent with a 17 month old who will be potty training
next camping season and I really don't want to take her into truck stop
restrooms (and when they need to go, they need to go NOW, not when you get
to the next rest stop).  Wouldn't it also be nice to be able to camp by
your favorite fishing hole or stream and still have the luxury of a clean
restroom handy.  I used to take along a portable solar shower when camping,
but that was only good if the sun had been shining on it all day, and then
the water was never &quot;just right&quot;.

Here's what the old shop teacher's imagination has come up with, a portable
restroom/shower complete with hot and cold running water, lights and heated
to boot!  It won't be as simple as putting wheels on a local Jonny on the
job rental and pulling it down the road, but here is what I am proposing:

The restroom/shower will be 3' x 4' x 6.5' tall with a door.  Inside will
be placed a chemical toilet that will be stored in the bus when going down
the road.  There will be a permanent sink with hot and cold faucets.  A
shower head will hang from the ceiling of the restroom, but a shower
curtain will keep the sink and whatever else you put on the counter dry.
You will stand on &quot;duck boards&quot; and the water will drain out the side.
This entire unit will pivot and lay down on top of it's own water tank
mounted on a trailer when going down the road, much the same as a
horizontal/vertical logsplitter folds up.  The tank should hold about 40
gallons, but you would only fill it when you get to the camp ground.

Beside the water tank will be an enclosed box that will hold a small RV
water heater, 12V water pump, batteries and a gasoline heater (to be ducked
into the restroom for those cold mornings or evenings).  The propane tank,
small gas tank and room for a cooler will go on the trailer in front.

When you get to the campground, or close to it, fill the water tank, then
when you get to your camp site, you will remove anything you are storing in
the restroom (sleeping bags, tents, duffle bags, etc.), rotate the restroom
to it's vertical position, put the chemical toilet inside and it's ready to
go!  A little cold?  Flip a switch and the gas heater comes to life and
within seconds a cold restroom warms up.  Light the pilot on the hot water
heater and in minutes you have warm water for your shower.

No longer are you at the mercy of dirty restrooms with cold showers and
waiting lines.  You can camp as far away from the &quot;facilities&quot; as you like.
When you are ready to go, drain the water tank, put the chemical toilet
back in the bus, put the restroom in the vertical position and off you go.
Another advantage is when you unhook, the restroom will mark your camping
spot.  The entire unit with all equipment aboard (minus the water and extra
camping gear) will weigh less than the &quot;puck&quot; trailers, so towing shouldn't
be a problem and the trailer will be the same width as the bus.

Sound crazy?  Sure, but how many shop teachers have you known that were
truly sane?  Now I just wish I was still teaching in the welding shop
instead of this technology lab, I could use all that free labor like I did
when I built that half track buggy back in the '80s!!
