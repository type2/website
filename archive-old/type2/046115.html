VW engines run like crap at 14.7:1. Stoic is chemically correct, but not
right for our engines.

if you swapped the carbs and had to run leaner jets I will agree that in
YOUR SITUATION (which is rare) you experienced what you experienced. But, if
you used a different set of carbs, jet size is irrelevant, since you used
different carbs (even if they were the same size and model). Tuning hundreds
of cars has shown to me that even the &quot;same&quot; combination uses different jets
on different engines.

I have even had some engines that needed different jets on each CYLINDER.

&gt; Hi John,

&gt; &gt; if you have ever raced, you would know that increasing the engine
&gt; &gt; displacement and using the same CORRECT jetting (on the old engine) will
&gt; &gt; result in jetting that is too lean. Increasing the jet sizes is the
&gt; &gt; solution.
&gt;
&gt; Sure for racing, the same as mechanical only advance is fine for racing.
&gt; All on or all off.  Drive the same race car on the street and load up the
&gt; plugs.  Ever notice the racers blipping their throttles to keep the cold
&gt; race plugs cleaned off?
&gt;
&gt; When you buy the performance Carter or Holley, it comes set up with
jetting
&gt; 5 to 10 sizes too big for a street engine, depending on the engine of
&gt; course. They have to usually be jetted down quite a bit.
&gt;
&gt; For racing, I shoot for maximum power, an air fuel ratio of 12.6:1.  Big
&gt; Jets. Most racer don't run power valves.
&gt;
&gt; An O2 sensor equipped car is tuned for the stoichiometric ideal of 14.7:1.
&gt;
&gt; The VWs for the street at cruise, not wide open throttle, run okay at 14:1
&gt; but I prefer richer for cooling.
&gt;
&gt; Watch the mixture with an accurate guage.  My 1974 1800's carbs were stock
&gt; with the 130 main jets.  I put in the 1979 2.0L engine I had and, as I did
&gt; not have the complete FI system, used the Carbs directly from the 1800.
My
&gt; emissions analyzer indicated an enrichment of the mixture.  Same jets,
same
&gt; venturi size, larger displacement = richer running engine.  (Engine not
worn
&gt; out or blowing oil.)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Theory gives way to experience this time.
&gt; &gt; I'm not trying to come across as arrogant, but you have to fatten up the
&gt; &gt; main jets if the displacement is increased.
&gt;
&gt; My experience proves the theory.  If the published theory that I
paraphrase
&gt; in my explanations is wrong in your experience, how can it be true in
mine?
