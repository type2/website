&gt; Thanks for the advice on my fuel injection. I have checked the part
&gt; numbers and the F.I. that came with the bus is definitely 1975 but I do
&gt; have all the parts for it. Karl and Steve are both right about the 78
&gt; wiring harness having more pins than the 75 for the AFM. It should run
&gt; fine with the complete 75 fuel injection, don't you think?

Yes, as long as you use ALL the 75 parts......
What style of EGR valve do you have on the 75? Isn't it a vacuum type with
an electric plug on it? The 78 is all mechanical and mounted on the plenum.

&gt; I spent today stripping the engine of all the sheet metal etc. I noticed
&gt; the difference in the pressure plate and fly wheel. Can I use the 78
&gt; flywheel or should I use the flywheel off the engine that came with the
&gt; engine? I assume the flywheel that came with the bus is a 1975 unit
&gt; because of the size of the clutch disk (215mm). Both the 75 and 78 units
&gt; are in good shape. Does either assembly have advantages over the other?
&gt; I hope to avoid problems with the starter gear engaging the flywheel.

The 78 228mm flywheel uses a different starter. The teeth on the pinion
stick out 1/2&quot; further. Looking at both starters: the 1.7 [210mm flywheel]
and 1.8 [215mm flywheel] teeth start at the drive sprague. On the 2.0
starter drive, there is a 1/2&quot; blank space between the teeth and the
sprague. You cannot use the self-supporting auto trans starter on a 2.0L
because of this.


&gt; Does the flywheel have any influence on crankshaft end play?

No.

&gt; I haven't
&gt; found anything to indicate that in any of my manuals but I'm hoping
&gt; someone with more experience knows for sure.
