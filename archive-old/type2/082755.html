Subject: Re: [T2] How to buy a bus &amp; limp shifter

Hi Jon, 

&gt;I've been reading a lot of those
&gt;technical articles (ver interesting), and learning as much as I can
&gt;about these things before I put a bit pile-o-cash down on one.

&gt;&gt; My biggest piece of advice for anyone about to buy a bus is PUT IT ON 
&gt; &gt;A HOIST so you can get a really good look at the underbody &amp; the 
&gt; &gt;lower panels. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've been burnt on rust more than anything else along the way. 

&gt;Where is the worst place for me to find rust on one of these vehicles? 
&gt;On my 'bird, you really don't want it in the cowel, or in the trunk, or
&gt;in the floor-pans. Where is the most common place to see rust, and
&gt;where is the worst place to find rust?
Where do I start?

Well, the biggest problems I've found are the front wheel arches, the bottom of the windscreen, the cabin floor &amp; steps &amp; primarily the battery tray next to the engine.

You also should check the front door pillars for rust &amp; the front apron as well as the skirts on both sides, being sure to check the skirt under the sliding door.

Of course, most cars rust in the sills so check out the door bottoms as well, but the windscreen, floor &amp; apron &amp; skirts spell out big problems &amp; winscreen rust often may be the beginnings of the apron rusting, water getting into the cab &amp; floor &amp; electrical problems caused by water in the fuse box under the dash.......you can guess how I found this out.


&gt; &gt;As long as you're buying a pre '72 bus there are 1600cc engines to be 
&gt; &gt;found out there that, if you have mechanical know-how &amp; patience, 
&gt; &gt;will be easy to work on. 

&gt;So, the '70 will probably have a 1600, right?
Yup, unless someone has spent the large sum to convert the Type 4 to an upright engine &amp; a seriously doubt that if it's a stock bus.
&gt; &gt;As far as the later Type 4 style 1700, 1800 &amp; 2.0l engines go, well, 
&gt; &gt;be careful because they can be very expensive to rebuild......found
&gt; &gt;this out the hard way too :-( 

&gt;Which is your preference, a Type 1 or Type 4 from a maintenance
&gt;perspective and from a performance perspective?
O.k., this is where things get a little complicated.

From a maintenance perspective, the most reliable, easy to service &amp; inexpensive engine VW ever put into a bus was the upright 1600cc dual port engine.

It is basic &amp; uses practically the same parts as the Beetle with the small but important exception of an extra engine mount on the front of the case that bolts to the cross beam in the engine bay.

The problem is that a Baywindow bus approaches 2 metric tonnes &amp; using a 1.6 litre engine to do this involves using low gearing in the transmission &amp; so 65 mph at the outside is the fastest you want to do in your bus with a 1600 engine &amp; gearbox in temperate weather or you risk overheating &amp; over revving the engine.

For performance, the 2.0l engine &amp; gearbox are certainly superior but it sucks more fuel &amp; costs about double to rebuild as well as the scary fact that the major manufacturer of main bearings for Type 4 engines stopped making them last year.

VW claimed a top speed for a 2.0l bus of 120km/h(approx 75mph) &amp; others have even claimed 160km/h(100mph) as a viable speed on autobahns but personally my 2.0l bus runs best at around 100km/h(65mph) &amp; to run it quicker for long periods in warm weather isn't a wise move either.

At the end of the day, air cooled engines depend on plenty of airflow &amp; lower revs &amp; buses are a load on them....the best solution for heat is an external oil cooler but if you're living in the mid-west or up north the cooler weather will solve a lot of problems. The word from those who know is to get an oil temp guage &amp; a tacho &amp; drive the bus based on them.


Think on this....are you going to tear around &amp; travel long distances in the bus at high speeds?

If so, then you should probably get a 2.0l.

If not &amp; your aim is to cruise &amp; enjoy the bus experience then find yourself a reliable 1600 bus or buy a 1600 bus with a good body &amp; have a local reputable shop build you a 1600 &amp; enjoy the ride.

&gt; &gt;It may cost you $50-$100 &amp; a few days waiting to use the local 
&gt; &gt;mechanics hoist but it could well save you ten times that amount or 
&gt; &gt;more in grief &amp; repairs. 

&gt;Don't I know it. I've walked away from a lot of cars because they
&gt;didn't look too good underneath (although they looked great up top). 
&gt;The '79 I looked at (and have since dismissed), was practically dripping
&gt;oil from everywhere underneath, and the guy hadn't driven it in a few
&gt;weeks. No thanks.
Been there done that......my last camper dropped oil like the Exxon Valdez :-)

As far as the limp shifter goes, there are 2 opposing factors coming into play.

Remember that a bus gearstift is a long throw stick &amp; as such is a little looser.

But have a professional check out that gearbox; not being able to find reverse isn't rare, my 77 has a tendency to be &quot;playful&quot; with reverse, but you should be able to get it eventually &amp; there may be bigger problems with it if you can't.

But if the 'box is the only problem, consider getting the bus.

1600 boxes are very common where I live &amp; aren't in great demand because of the their lower ratios &amp; perceived slowness so you may well be able to come across a decent g'box if you need to replace it &amp; VW boxes aren't that hard to change. 

The clutch may well be fine.......My brother's Beetle just had the clutch done by a great VW mechanic &amp; the friction point engages very high so it may be o.k.


&gt;Thanks for the advice. I'll spam the list with my overwhelming glee
&gt;once I find the right bus. :)

Feel free. I certainly do 

Anyhow, see how you go and be picky &amp; pushy.

It's a buyers market &amp; there's no such thing as new tricks, just new victims so ask every uncomfortable question you need to so you don't get duped.

I wish everyone who was selling a bus was as honest about them as people are on this list.

Happy hunting &amp; keep me posted on your success.



Cheers

Andrew Wood
