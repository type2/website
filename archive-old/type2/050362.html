It is not supposed to work that way. I used both IE and Netscape Com. 4.7
and it worked great. It uses a Java script to change both the nav bar and
the main page at the same time. That may cause some trouble if your browser
does not like them or deal with them properly. I tried to stay away from any
fancy gee-gaws to make it work on most all systems. It works good at home on
my old IE and works great at work on my new toaday PIII 750 with MS2000 Pro
and newest IE.

I was able to get around using NescapeV6.0, but it opened all daughter 
pages by launching a new copy of NS6.0.  Kind of clumsy, IMHO.
