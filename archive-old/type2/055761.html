Hey Dave,
  I have a 74 walkthrough with a slider. I made a center console an
installed a rear faceing seat (one of the short middle seats).
I lived with this setup for about 8 months and it is now gone. In other
words put something in that isnt alot of work to see
if you realy like it first. I am going to put in two rear facing &quot;jump
seats&quot; with a fold down table. I am also going to fabricate a
head rest extension for the back bench seat. With this extension for
head support it will be safer and also will support the 
double air mattress that I have when the back is folded down. If you get
a good one they are fairly long lived. Also get a air
pump that both pumps the mattress up and will quickly suck all the air
out of it for day use. 50 bucks gets you the mattress!
Seems to work for me so far, good luck.
   Fred S. was that you I talked to at the show with the wet westy's
tag? It was towards the end of the day, you were
with the guy from Canada, eh.
Tak sa Mycket (thanks),
