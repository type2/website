Volks,

Damn, I hate being the ogre.  But I guess it comes with the job....

First, if you have a problem, write to *me* not to the list. *The* thought
that should run thru your mind just before you push the send button is,
&quot;Do 800 people need to read this post?&quot;  or at least a substantial
percentage of that number. On &quot;For Sale&quot; and requests for info, the answer
is an obvious yes; for regional stuff, it is less clear, but still
passable.  For comments, I am the only person who *needs* to see it or can
do anything about it.  Send it to me, not the list.  Once again, my
addresses are

dworkin_at_type2_dot_com
dworkin_at_ari_dot_net

Either will work, and I do try to do my best.  I apologize if sometimes
the works get a bit clogged, but I am trying :-(

On the topics of the day:

Helping stranded VW busses *is* appropriate to the list.  Dicussing the
homlessness situation is *not*.  Please, if you want to discuss helping,
e-mail Barry (pray4me_at_cais_dot_com), privately.

No, the Grateful Dead and Phil Lesh aren't an appropriate subject either,
and I shoulda jumped up and made a great big hairy thing of myself
earlier, but *my* private soapbox is organ donations (ask me about mine
:-) so I cut it a bit of slack.  Sorry :-(  Kill it.

All caps is a boo-boo.  We all do it at least once (when I did it, of
course, I was actually on an old KSR terminal and lower case was not an
option {but I'm showing my age :-}).  Letting people know is part of the
down side of this job, as I said, but I usually send p-mail if I possibly
can, to avoid embarrassing people in public.  Many threads grind to a halt
because of these p-mails, thank goodness.

Lastly, my sincere thanks to everyone who has offered opinions on the
engine.  It helped me immensely, and informed me on a number of options I
was not aware of.  I will be composing a summary post later (prolly
tomorrow). (and how *did* it veer off into Subaru conversions anyhow? :-)
