Volks...

  Just finished some rust repair under my windshield. Before I get the new glass in, I figured I should clean up that little space between the windshield and the dash vents. There's a little bubbling of the paint there and a little bit-o-rust. Ideas anyone? I thought I would just spray a little rust converter on there. But maybe I should paint it?

TIA,
James 68
