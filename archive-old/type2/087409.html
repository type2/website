Subject: Re: [T2] Generator question on 71 Westy

In his Car of the Century, Garwood lists the AB series engine as in 
production for the Bug from 1971 to 1973.  Originally configured as a 1300 it 
kicked out 44hp DIN.  Your serial number would indicate that yours is a 1973 
production engine manufactured about midway during the production year.
