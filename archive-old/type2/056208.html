Excerpts from mail: 14-Jul-98 Refrigerators by &quot;Jeff Stewart&quot;_at_aol_dot_com 
&gt; I've seen a lot of questions on the list about refrigerators (
installing, repai
&gt; ring,etc.) What I use in mine (non-deluxe) is an Igloo refrigerator
that runs on
&gt;  both AC/DC. I plug it in to AC the night before,so it gets cold, then
load it w
&gt; ith drinks, food,( helps if they are already cold too) take it out to
the camper
&gt;  and plug it into the cigarette lighter. When you get to a campground,
you can s
&gt; witch it back to AC. If found it works great, but obviously would'nt
do if you'r
&gt; e camping where there are no AC hookups. Cost about $125.00   Jeff

Is this the cooler looking type? Coleman makes one of these for around
$75 that will cool your stuff (45 degrees below outside temp) and also
heat it too. It is ac/dc too. I was thinking of buying one... Has any
bought one of these?
