Subject: &quot;Almost&quot; Friday  &quot;post open&quot;

Not to jump the gun, and on a topic which is dear to us all, but if a can of
food has a &quot;blister&quot;, on the top or bottom, isn't that a sign of Botulism of
the contents?  And if so, then how can a can of beer have the same &quot;fault&quot;,
and still taste like beer?  Like, what caused the &quot;dimple&quot;, on the bottom of
the can, when it had not been opened, and was in a &quot;gov't beer store&quot;?
Inquiring minds want to know, eh?
