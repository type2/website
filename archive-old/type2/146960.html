I know it's not friday, but all this talk of road trips had me
thinking about what stuff I'll bring.

Then I saw this on Woot. I dunno. Would I really need these things?
How tough is it to remove  lug nut? (These are rhetorical questions in
case your sarcasm meter's broken):

This McCulloch Auto Emergency Kit is perfect for automotive
emergencies. Its impact wrench will lefty-loosen and righty-tighten
your lug nuts with ease, and comes with four lug sockets in popular
sizes. The air compressor inflates flat tires a whole lot faster than
your current method

Hi Don,

I've found that a portable air compressor is worth carrying. I carry one in my bus and have used it myself as well loaned it to others on the road. (mine clips to the battery rather than the cigarette lighter). 

It is questionable how useful a portable impact wrench would be on the road. However, I had an experience once where a meathead of a tire installer over torqued the lug nuts so much that I needed a breaker bar with a long pipe extension to break them loose. Fortunately I discovered this in my driveway - I would never have been able to get them off on the road. I guess the moral of the story is that if you make sure that you can loosen/tighten your lug nuts at home before a trip with your normal tools, you should have no problem on the road.

Later,
