Really?  Where did you get a new German pump?  I thought they were NLA.

&gt;The German pumps are almost four times the price but what a difference in 
&gt;performance.  The bus now runs like great.  Should have bought original in 
&gt;the first place instead of three Brazilian pumps and the time to R&amp;R.  I 
&gt;guess the Brazilian pumps don't put out the capacity that a dual carb 
&gt;system needs.

My problem was that the Brazilian pump put out too much capacity and 
flooded my carbs.  Before it died at least.  Are you sure that wasn't 
happening to you?


&gt;My advice is to buy the German.  You won't regret it.

I won't argue with you there.
