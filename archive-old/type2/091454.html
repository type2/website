Subject: Re: [T2] timing light vs. static

Let me put it this way. If you only use your bus to kill the grass
under it while it sits not running, static is the way for you. But
seriously dynamic timing is much more accurate. In some cases where
there is a vacuum retart as well as advance it is even needed. It lets
you tune the engine to what its supposed to be &amp; actually doing.
Timing static is good to know in a pinch on the side of the road if
you don't have your timing light with you though.
