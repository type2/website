Subject: idle speed to fast

Volks,
  I have a '79 2.0L/FI with Calif emissions. My problem is the idle speed.
In the morning it starts up just fine and runs great, however after driving
about 10 miles on the freeway going about 65, I exit and come to a stop and
the motor tends to idle about 1200 rpm. If I keep my brake on and let the
clutch out (put a load on the motor) the idle speed returns to its normal
settings which is about 825 rpm. Sometimes the idle speed will very slowly
return to 825 rpm. Here is what I have done to try to find the problem:

		1. Replaced the dizzy (with a stock) 050. I though it still might be the
mech. advance but every time I check 		   the rotor for its spring the rotor
returns back to its original position. This is how I was told to check
the mech. advance.

		2. Removed the cold start injector wires (disabled the injector)

		3. Put more tension on the throttle body spring

		4. Correct timing.

		5. Replace the Air Box


I feel (sometimes) it could be heat related and then sometimes I thing it
might me vacuum related. I can't narrow this problem down.

Any information will be greatly appreciated.
