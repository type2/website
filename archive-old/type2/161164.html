Subject: Re: [T2] Great North American Extreme Bus Race

Well, I have to disagree with you about the race issue.  In this race, speed would be the last factor to consider.   Busses, regardless of HP, are so similar in terms of maintainable speeds that it would be negligible compared to navigation, planning, maintenance, etc.  Everyone would not choose the same route.  And even the map sources disagree on which is the shortest.  And the shortest may very well take the most time.  There are many factors one would have to consider.  Speed wouldn't be much of one.  And the carabus idea would take the competitive fun out of it.  JMHO...KR

My quarrel is not with the 5,000-mile length but with the fact that it is  
a race, which by definition means pushing your bus engine to the limit,  
something I prefer not to do unless my wife is giving birth on the way to  
the hospital.

I can see this trip, however, as a rally or a carabus, where the idea  
would be not to be competitive but to be cooperative, with the goal that  
all who start finish, and busloads of comraderie and adventure along the  
way.

Cheers,

John R.
