Subject: CD Player

I would have to recommend re-wiring each speaker so it uses its own 
positive and negative wire.  The old way of installing speakers was to 
use a common ground, some systems even had you wire the grounds to the 
chassis.  Since that could cause feedback newer systems have you run 
the wires from each speaker to your radio or amp outputs.

As for which terminal is + and which is - on the speakers, it's okay 
just to hook it up then put in a stereo test cd.  My cd cleaner comes 
with the sound test signals on it and you can pick them up for under 
$15.00 at your local store. If the sound on the test cd sounds wrong, 
then reverse the wires on one of the speakers and test again.

&gt;
&gt; In my back speakers , I have 3 wires , I assumed that the one which is
&gt; common to the two speakers (in gray color) is the neg wire  and
&gt; correspond to the  small connector
&gt; am I right ?  how do  you connect it to the cd player which got 2 neg
&gt; wire ?
