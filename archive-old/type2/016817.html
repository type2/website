Found this in the Ponca City News Online and thought I'd share it. It
doesn't answer too many questions, but it does fill in some gaps.

  Ponca City Man Found in Garage

 ... The body of a 25-year-old Ponca City man was found Monday night in the garage
  of his home in the 100 block of Warwick Road.
  According to police the body of Josh Rodgers was found after they received a call
  from a woman at 9 p.m. stating that she had found a man unconscious on the floor
  of his garage.
  Preliminary police investigation reports state Rodgers apparently died from carbon
  monoxide poisoning.
