Subject: Re: [T2] living in a VW

I lived in my bus for nearly 2 years straight.  Its great for the single
life.  While living in the bay area, I folder the rear bench down in my
transporter, laid a peice of plywood down on top that extended past the
bench about 1 foot, and it was perfect for me to put my queen size futon
mattress on.  Combined with two layers of limo tint, a plastic
two-drawer dresser from WalMart, and I was set.  Parked it at work most
of the time.  Woke, up...went to the gym at work....took
shower.....stopped by the cappucino machine....then headed to the desk. 
Only had cell phone bill and payment for storage where I kept larger
stuff.  Great income-debt ratio.  :)  My bus was my first car, and my
first house.  Was great.  Cant do it with a wife and two kids though. 
hehe.  Have fun.
