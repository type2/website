Subject: Re: [T2] '68-71 style bumper beading???????

Hiya Blake,

Just like you I rehabbed my front bumper some time ago.  When I went to look 
for the white beading I was shuffled from place to place, none of the 
resellers having this particular item.  And then (on an online auction site 
which will go nameless here) I found a set being offered for bid.  I snatched 
'em up.  Exactly what I needed.  Apparently they had been sitting on a 
dealer's shelves somewhere in Asia.  And............I noticed that he ran 
several other auctions for these things.  Maybe he has some more?

The seller finds VW stuff overseas and imports it for sale.  His name is Mark 
Dearing and he works out of Grants Pass, Oregon.  I do not have his e-mail 
address but you can contact him through that online auction site (the one 
with an E).  His site handle is Barndoor1.
Good luck to you.

Mike
