Subject: RE: [T2] Vanagon seat belts in a '76 Westy

I looked at this and must say John does a real nice site. I am going to do
this to our van soon, but am concerned about one or 2 safety things. When
mounting the Vanagon belt to the pillar I reckon the extra length bolt that
holds the belt on with the nut spacer might - under the stress of an
accident - given that extra leverage, tear the mount away. There must be an
existing seat belt mounting bolt in something that is all the right sizes...
The bottom mounts I will install metal load spreading plates behind with
nice rounded corners to prevent shear in accident. The fender washer doesnt
spread the load enough I feel. Nice idea and I cant wait for the convenience
of retractable seat belts.

P.S. has anybody else ever gotten married to someone they met on the list? I
am no longer in Australia, AZ instead for the last 20 months married to
Trudell, so happy I hope we never recover.  So far we met Uncle Jerry and
Melissa,
Lovely people. See you all at Jerome next time. BW.
