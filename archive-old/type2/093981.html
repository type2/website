Subject: My bus is running, well.. close to great!

    
Listees, 

Some of you know I've been battling with getting my bus to idle. I bought a 
new carb,  lets see, nearly two weeks ago but it's still not here. With help 
from some great list members I found the problem with my bus. The idle 
control was disconnected. I got that hooked up and the bus still ran a bit 
poorly. A friend of mine came by today and adjusted my existing carb and 
checked my timing. Now my bus runs pretty well. I took it for a long spin and 
no problem. Now I have a bus that idles and new brakes that stop it. Wow. ; )
I did notice however that when I parked it a bit of white smoke was coming 
from the vents on the back pillars. Smelled kinda oily. Normal? The bus only 
has about 200 miles on it since a complete rebuild. I did have the valves 
adjusted at 100. Seems to have good power and idle fine. 

Thanks all!
Melissa
