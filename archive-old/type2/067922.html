&gt; But I do remember clearly how James Bond's usual high tech ride got
&gt; blown up in For Your Eyes Only and he escapes from bad guys driving
&gt; high powered BMW's in a Citron. No torpedoes or guided missiles
&gt; fired from the rear view mirrors, just good stunt driving, guts, 
&gt; and a little luck.
&gt; 
&gt; A Westy is a deluxe, opower rich getaway car compared to a Citron.
&gt; They have canvas sling seats, for God's sake...

Well a citron is sorta a kinda lemon.  I think ol' Surfer Bob means the
French-mobile named Citroen.  All Citroen's are not bad cars.  While they
definately made some real lemons, they also make some of the finest (and
VERY fast cars) in the world.  At least they did before the Sons-of-the-
brothers-Peugoet got in there and gobbled up the company. No more of
either in the US.

The Citroen that was in the movie (I have not seen this) is probably an
old 2CV -- literally the &quot;two horse&quot; car (and we thought the 36hp VW's
were sad).  These make the VW Things look handsome.  They make the mexi-beetle
look expensive, too.  The last Citroens sold in the US were the SM model,
with the Maserati engine.  These are NOT 2CV's.

Rating all Ciroens by 2CV standards is like saying that BMWs suck because
*they* made the Isetta, a truly collossally totally mondo-awful thing
that they sold many of (see, those stuffy germans DO have some sense of
humor!).

Citroen/Peugeot, and their marketing in the US, make VWoA look like marketing
buzz-saws.  A few years ago, Peugeot had one of the hottest little cars
in Europe -- the 205.  The only ones that made it to the US were brought
in for the Pike's Peak Rally (I don't think the 205's ever won, but somebody's
sure to correct me -- Audi seems to own this race).  The little 205, with
an engine in front and a spare engine in the rear (and four turbos, and
four-wheel-drive) made the GTI's and CRX's look pretty tame.  They didn't
even offer this in the US -- instead they go head-to-head with everybody
else and offer the rather indifferent 405 and aged 505 models.  At real
high prices.  All parts available, provided you wish to take cruise line
to the south of France to pick them up (cheaper and faster than the Peugeot
dealers).

Like VW, they sell incredibly well everywhere else in the world, but in
the US they sucked big-time.  Next time you think how bad your local Veedub
dealer is, know that it could be worse.

I had several 505's.  Great cars.  I bought them because of my Scotch nature.
They were sooooo cheap used, and such fine pieces of machinery.  Couldn't
get parts, though.  My last one blew a head gasket, and the dealer said
&quot;$100 bucks, six weeks&quot;, and I went out and bought a new Acura.  Ended up
putting the new head gasket on for the new owner.  Now no dealers, oh well.
