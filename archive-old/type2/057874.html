Subject: mini trip report

Took a weekend trip from our digs in SoCal to Atascadero, on
California's Central Coast (it's actually in the southern half of the
state, but the residents don't like to be associated with us SoCal folk)

A couple of hundred miles each way, about half of that on (sob) I-5.

Outbound, we started at 8:00 AM, to beat the heat of the latest heat
wave.  Stopped in Gorman (top of the grapevine) for breakfast at
Brian's Diner.  Good eats in a 50's neon-and-stainless-steel
atmosphere.  A couple of fast food places have invaded Gorman, but
definitely go for the Diner if you happen by.

Dropped down the north side of the Grapevine, smelling the eau de
brakes as the trucks strain to slow themselves.  Several gravel
runaway ramps on that route, most look recently used.

Hit the flat and headed across the Central Valley.  If you like
Kansas, the Central Valley is for you.  Just as flat, but not nearly
as many towns to distract you from the monotony.

Turned onto Highway 46 at Lost Hills (they really are, not a hill to
be seen) and headed west toward Paso Robles.  Once over a low pass,
the road goes past Cholame, where James Dean went to the big movie
studio in the sky, unfortunately taking a nice Porsche with him.  The
landforms change from grassy hills to vinyards, supporting the Central
Coast's extensive winery industry.  I always wonder about how the
tourism office promotes those driving tours of wineries.  After
visiting a half-dozen wineries, and tasting a few offerings at each,
I'd assume that some black coffee would be in order!

Headed south on 101 to Atascadero, where my in-laws reside.  The kids
were happy to see their cousins.  The weather was by then over 100F,
so we loaded everyone up and headed down to Morro Bay to hit the beach.

Morro Bay seems to be Vanagon heaven.  Lots of very late model
vanagons, particularly campers, everywhere you look.  My theory is
that all the hippies from the 60's got older, made some money, moved
to Morro Bay, and went out and bought the nearest thing to their
beloved old buses.  I probably saw a dozen of those $30K vanagons in
the few hours I was there.

Beach was nice, though a bit too cold for my swimming tastes.  The
kids had a great time dragging seaweed around and covering themselves
in sand.  (hint:  for easy sand removal, sprinkle talc on the sandy
areas and let it sit for a couple of minutes.  Sand wipes off easily
without scratching that way.)

Back to Atascadero, stayed the night, had gourmet pizza dinner at
Marie's parent's house.

Next day, headed home.  Left Atascadero at 10:00.  By the time we got
to I-5 it was getting seriously hot.  We were applying ice water very
librally, both internally and externally.  Saw a couple of baywindows
on Hwy 46 and waved.

Got to the bottom of the Grapevine, outside temperature was 110F. 
Started the climb from 500ft to 4200ft.  Quickly entered &quot;VW bus
hillclimb mode&quot; (3rd gear, 40MPH).  Saw a lot of cars broken down.  In
fact, they were so numerous we were seldom out of sight of a breakdown
. No VWs by the roadside, though, including us.  Bus ran like a champ
right up to the top, and we cruised down the other side toward home. 
Love those aircooleds!

Heading down the south side of the grapevine, we were adrift in a
4-lane sea of motorhomes, trucks, boat trailers, motorcycles, etc.  I
hate to think what it'll look like next weekend!

Pulled into home, weather had cooled off to 109F.  Aaaah!  Turned on
the swamp cooler, and took a nice afternoon nap.

It's now 9:30PM and it's cooled off to 89F.  Perhaps I'll sleep in the
refrigerator tonight :)
