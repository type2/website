Fellow lists members,

 In my eternal quest for parts, I spent quite an amount of time gathering
links for my personal quest. I believe it to be comprehensive. I have seen
other list members ask for parts that are readily available but don't know
where to find or look. This is not a plug since it is just my personal
website and have nothing to gain, not even a counter meter.

 The site is at: http://members.iglou_dot_com/raulb/ (both in Spanish and
English), click on Volkswagen and then links. That will take you there.
Also, I'm almost done with the VW Type 2 Gallery for your viewing pleasure
and for restoration purposes (it's not in the same site/server). I will post
the URL/link in the near future.

 I would like to thank the very few that sent pictures and those who have
given me permission to copy pictures from their websites/pages.
