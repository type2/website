Sean,

&gt; Supplying a voltage to the ECU through the temp sensor wire ain't gonna
cut
&gt; it and hopefully you have not damaged the ECU by trying this.

Unforrtunately, I did this, not thinking. But I have a spare FI motor.

&gt; Probably the easiest thing would be to have a helicoil or timesert put in
&gt; the head so you can install a new sensor.  Shouldn't cost much and
shouldn't
&gt; have to remove the head or engine, it's a blind hole that the sensor
screws
&gt; into so there's no danger of getting metal filings where they shouldn't
be.

This is prob the answer to my troubles

&gt; Another thing to check is the right side head.

Engine is original. No hole.

&gt; If you try to run the engine without the sensor attached at all, the ECU
&gt; sees this as infinite resistance,

The Sensor read infinite ohms when the sensor was still in the van, I tested
it and so did a friend and we both got the same diagnosis after checking the
AFM, Thermo time switch, cold start valve and checking for bad grounds. The
only thing that checked bad was the sensor, thats how I tested.

&gt; Of course this is even assuming that the temperature sensor is the problem
&gt; which I'm not convinced of by reading your message because I don't know if
&gt; you tested it properly.  It's certainly a problem now in that it's not
&gt; installed but I don't know yet if a new one will fix the original problem.
