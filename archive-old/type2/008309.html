&gt; It's good to be onboard this list. I'm sure it'll be a great resource.
&gt; Excuse me for asking some obvious newby questions and if the answers
are
&gt; archived somewhere, do tell.
&gt; 
&gt; (79 Westy)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Seatbelts: I'd like to swap-in a set that retract - is this
commonly done?

In the archives, and it's easily done.  I did a bolt-in installation
on the front seats using Audi belts from the boneyard.

&gt; 2. Baby Seat:  Any comments on installing a kid seat in the back?

Same as any other car.  Install seat, tighten belt.  If you need an
upper strap you need to find or drill a hole through the luggage floor
and install a bolt using large washers.
 
&gt; 3. What circuits run on the axillary battery?  I'd like to run most
&gt; circuits from this battery when camping.

All circuits that aren't present in a non-camper model.

&gt; 4.  Gas heater  (I know these are marginal at best but):  When I run
it all
&gt; I get is gas fumes and no heat. Comments?

As in the gas heater that lives in the engine compartment?  Those are
terrible!  Send it to me immediately so that I can dispose of it
properly!

Seriously, gas heaters are effective, but must be running properly. 
See the archives and the type2_dot_com site for more information.
