Hey Steve

Do you remember the 73 Camper at EveryBus,, with the engine case broken around
the mounting studs?

It went about 300 miles south, then 300 miles north with NO fasteners!
It is an automatic trans. so no clutch pressures
The flex plate finally broke, like a tin can that had been wiggled back and
forth tooo many times!

I am guessing,, that engine drove for over 20,000 miles with no lower studs.

Jamie , thinks all 4 is the lowest safe numbers,, Rivers

&gt; OK... so we all know that VW put four fasteners between the engine and
&gt; trans for a reason.  

&gt; I am wondering if anyone is brave enough to admit the minimum number of
&gt; fasteners that it takes to connect the engine and trans on a bus with the
&gt; bearer bar (in an emergency only (of course :-)).  I cannot imagine that
&gt; anyone has ever run a VW for very long without the upper right nut/bolt.
