Subject: RE: [T2]76 Brakes (update) HeLP~!~

You can use a pressure bleeder, they are the best, they clamp over your master cylinder and push air through a several gallon pot of brake fluid, then you can crack the bleeders and watch the fluid go from dirty to clean, I borrow one when I need it, you might be able to rent one.


&gt; Have you tried back bleeding the brakes? You know, slowly pumping clean 
&gt; fluid into the bleeder on each wheel until it starts to fill the master 
&gt; cylinder. I can't remember if that works on a bus or not. I know I've done 
&gt; it on other cars. 


&gt; problem is now i cant get any fluid out to the back tires at all....???/
