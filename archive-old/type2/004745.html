Subject: Air conditioning in a '78 Westy

Hello, I am new to this list but I feel at home already. My first VW is a 1978 sage green Westfalia camper with factory air
conditioning. We are trying to get it working again. The compressor is (I think, based on what I have read in the type2_dot_com library)
the old York compressor, but it doesn't have a belt. Does anyone know a part number or where I can order one? Also we are trying to
figure out how to install it. Heck, just ANY information on a/c would be a big help. Thanks
