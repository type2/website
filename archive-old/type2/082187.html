Subject: 86-91 vanagon questions and I'M In the Movies!!!

Hi everyone!
Long time no posts! Just wanted to spread the word and ask for some h-elp. I 
have a 1986 Vanagon and am looking for a good USED exhaust pipe for it. Any 
van from 86 on up will work. The one I am in need of is the pipe that goes on 
the front part of the engine (towards the front of the bus) from one side to 
another. What I want is a used pipe or a complete used exhaust. I need to 
spend less than $100 for everything though. If anyone could help me I would 
be very appreciative!
Also, I was recently interviewed (and filmed) by Walt Disney for the upcoming 
special edition DVD of the LOVE BUG! It's great to be part of history! Look 
for it in stores this fall! In case anyone out there is wondering who I am 
(since I rarely post) please check my web site at 
http://members.aol_dot_com/vwdude1957/index.html for more details!   Furthermore, 
if there are any aspiring web designers out there 
who would like to experiment on my site I'd be glad to hear from you! Once 
the DVD is released I am going to have a HUGE amount of traffic!
Take care everyone!

Dave
