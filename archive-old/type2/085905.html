To retain the fluted end, go to any auto parts store and pick up a piece of 
1/4&quot; brake line(steel).  Cut one end off, and remove the threaded piece.  
Ta-da!

&gt; &gt;There is a tube with a flanged end that goes in from the carb side,
&gt;thrugh the shroud, throught the front tin, and which holds the seal away
&gt;from the throttle cable that is guided by the tube.
&gt;
&gt;I gather that I am looking for a tube then?  If I do not have a correct 1, 
&gt;Is there something I could use for a substitute?  Get more from the Web.
