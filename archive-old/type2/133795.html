Subject: Re: [T2] Seeking testimonials: longblock from Boston Bob

Hello Mark   I have  done a couple of Boston Bob motors for customers and 
haven't had any problems.  I haven't never meet him personally but have had 
dealings with him for many years . You just have to remember that he is a Yankee 
and he's almost as hard to understand as myself. (northern vs southern accents)  
. I havent had any problems with his work or products. The last couple I have 
done were type 4 and a wasserboxer.  later and have fun  Mark dearing
