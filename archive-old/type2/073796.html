Subject: Re: [T2] Re: seat belts

&gt;From: Robert Taylor &lt;rtaylor_at_geog.ucsb_dot_edu&gt;
...
&gt;Let me recall... That is how they are mounted in a Vanagon, isn't it? Not
&gt;at floor level, but halfway up the bulkhead? I've wondered two things
&gt;about that:
&gt;
&gt;1- Would they be long enough, if mounted on the floor with a bracket in a
&gt;Westy?
&gt;
&gt;2- If I mounted them to the bulkhead too, how would I make the point of
&gt;attachment suitably strong? I didn't want to get into a welding project,
&gt;but it seems that the point of attachment on the floor has a welded nut
&gt;beneath it or something to give it extra strength. I was afraid of just
&gt;drilling a hole in the bulkhead (into relaitvely thin sheet metal maybe?)
&gt;to mount them in the Westy.
&gt;
&gt;What do you think?

Robert,

They are long enough in my '76 when mounted to the floor.  They ARE mounted 
to the post behing the door in the Vanagon, BUT I had the same concerns you 
did about doing this in my Bus.  I was concerned about weakening the post 
and the lack of strength in the sheetmetal.  The L-bracket just gets screwed 
into the existing hole on the floor where the button seatbelt peice mounts 
(just behind the seat by the front door).  I asked someone my BOW-WOW store 
and they recommended the L-bracket.  Said there used to be a company that 
sold a kit that came with an L-bracket for putting Rabbit belts in a Bug 
(though I've heard Rabbit belts are tto short for a Bus).

Ted
