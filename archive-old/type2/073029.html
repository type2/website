Subject: Re: Valve Question


&gt;Ok, i will admit, I know very little about Volkwagons as of yet

&quot;Volkswagens.&quot; In any case all this stuff applies to any conventional
internal combustion engine, not just aircooled.

&gt;but I
&gt;am learning fast.  However, one thing that confused me were valves.
&gt;What exactly is a 'valve job', valve adjustment, and something about
&gt;'lapping the valves'? My question is What exactly do these terms mean?

Engines are brutal, it is their nature. Your carburetor (or fuel injection)
takes gasoline + air and mixes them and shoots out this gas that is just
waiting to catch fire.

It's already combustible as hell, but then the intake valve opens and the
piston sucks the mixture into the cylinders like loading a huge hypodermic
syringe. Right? Like you're hauling back on a big plunger, taking a deep
breath of this air/gasoline. Huffing. Then the piston changes direction and
compresses it.

The piston compresses this ignitable vapor/gasoline bomb-stuff to something
like 1/7 of its normal size. Packing that vapor tight.

Then the spark plug lights it all on fire. Not that that is really very
important, it isn't. Combustion is just a tool we use to get that air/fuel
to do what we're after, and what we want it to do is EXPAND, we want it to
pop open hard, because that will force the piston back away, and that
outward piston motion is the beautiful stuff that makes the engine go. When
stuff burns it expands, this is a law of the universe, ask George Lyle, he
is a fizzycist.

That is what combustion does.

What the valves do, in their very essence, is to let the carb-vapor in, and
let the exhaust smoke out when everything is burned--but the important
thing is that they stay completely CLOSED when the compression/combustion
is happening. The intake/expulsion is easy, any idiot can do that. The
important thing is that they cannot leak vapor in or exhaust out when they
are closed.

A &quot;valve job&quot; is replacing the valves and their seats and guides, so the
valves don't waller around and they have something firm and true to seal
against.

&quot;Lapping&quot; is grinding the valves into their seats with a substance called
carborundum paste, which is made of tiny bits of abrasive that are nearly
as hard as diamonds. When a valve is lapped well it is a
metal-against-metal joint so tight that it won't leak any air even under
vast pressure.

&quot;Adjusting the valves&quot; is making sure that the rocker arms, which push the
valves open, back off enough to let them close all the way before pushing
them in again. If they didn't close all the way you'd have either an intake
leak (in which case you'd have poor power because the engine couldn't get
enough to eat) or an exhaust leak (in which case the exhaust valves would
actually burn up because the temperatures involved are so hot).

Let me know if this is not clear. I am assuming you have a head + valve
train to look at, otherwise I'm talking Chinese. I can dig up one to send
you if you can't get one locally.
