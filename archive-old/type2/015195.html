&gt;One more question. Did '70 Kombis have a clovebox lid, or did they come
without
&gt;one being fitted?

 Hello Kai,

 VW's level of standard equipment differed from country to country so I
 can't say for sure from the Australian perspective what the British
 story would have been,however, since your camper was originally
 a panelvan,I doubt it ever came new with a glovebox lid. 

 From my observations over the years,it seems that for '68-'79 vans
 only microbusses &amp; deluxes ever came with one standard.All panels,
 2 seater window vans,S/C &amp; D/C pickups just had the glove box sans lid.
 No doubt you could have optioned one in these vehicles but...
 As I said,this was the case in Oz,and perhaps the US listees will report
 differently.

 Go to a few swap meets,they usually aren't too hard to find,but check that
 the hinge springs to hold them open still work.

 Cheers,
