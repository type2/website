&gt; Either the gauge is off 50 degrees or more, even after the temp

You'll have to calibrate it to find out for sure.

&gt; I don't have the equipment to check precisely, but
&gt; the plugs don't show lean running,

It's hard to read FI plugs. All the plugs reading tips are from the carb
days when leaded fuel was available. Even the shut off and coast method is
not helpful.

&gt; I'd like to blame the gauge and,
&gt; in hindsight, should have tested it in frying oil.

IMHO you have to test every gauge before isntalling it otherwise you go from
guessing to further guessing. I don't know if they are consistently
accurate/inaccurate and everyone has a different engine which makes
compatison harder but check out how bad this VDO OT gauge performed:

&gt; Something that might help me is knowing
&gt; the trends of other FI busses with CHTs.  That is, what's the range you
&gt; see from idle to around town to easy highway to hard highway?  This bus
&gt; is getting frustrating, and I haven't even had a serious electrical
&gt; problem yet (discounting my instrument light goof)!  I knew the gauges
&gt; would bring worry, but I hope in the end they pay off.

I'm on the verge on a CHT measuring experiment. I'll have some data to share
to give you an idea of how the gauge should perform.
