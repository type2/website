1) as far as timing is concerned, is advanced timing considered
when the mark on the pully is to the right or the left of the
engine seam?

Too confusing right now....

2) when A car won't start, but the battery will operate radio
, etc, and the car can be jump started easily, is this a symptom
for a solinoid problem.

Not necessarily a solenoid problem, more likely a problem getting sufficient
voltage to the solenoid. When you get a jump start, there is additional help
supplying current, so the battery voltage doesn't drop as much.  With higher
battery voltage, you get higher voltage at the solenoid, so you are more likely
to get it to kick in.  If you can short across the battery and solenoid
terminals on the starter and get it to operate, chances are that you have the
classic problem of excessive resistance between the battery and solenoid.

The round trip for this current is from the battery (+) terminal, to starter
battery terminal, to ignition switch (perhaps via a fuse), back to starter
solenoid terminal, through the solenoid, to the starter case, to the
transmission case, to the transmission ground strap, to the frame, back to the
ground strap to your battery (-) terminal.  A long trip where there is a lot of
possible places for resistance to increase.  Check all your wiring for clean,
tight and secure electrical connections, including the strap from the tranny to
the frame.

I only got mine working reliably with a booster relay.  A lot of list members
rig up a standard starter solenoid and fabricate the necessary wiring.  I have
little enough time to work on Sunshine, so I used the Bosch WR1 Low Voltage
Relay Kit, which only took about half an hour to install and my starter now
works every time I turn the key.

Of course, before all this, my ignition switch did fail, as well as my starter
solenoid, so there are other possibilities to investigate.
