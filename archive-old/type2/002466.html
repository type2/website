My 72 came without some of the grommets and things needed to seal the tin on
the engine.  I've been able to find some of what I need, but perhaps someone
can direct me to a source for the following:

Grommets that surround the heater ducts as they come through the sides of
the tin.

The oblong plug that seals the plate over the alternator's tension
adjustment bolt.

The oval plug in the back panel  through which the throttle cable enters the
engine compartment.

Thanks,

Grant
