All,


Well, I'm pleased to report another trouble-free trip
made in the '69 Westy!!!


Somehow, the wife and I found ourselves being
chaperones on my 10 year old step-sons field trip to
Hoover dam and Route 66. Since it was an overnighter
and the whole class was going, the parents were asked
to drive their own vehicles to save room on the school
bus.

Now, my bus is very reliable, but the motor of unknown
age/mileage/care/origin (I've only owned this bus for
a year and logged about 12,000 miles on it so far!)
scares me a bit when roadtrips are involved.
Especially when we happen to be *really* broke and AAA
expired 2 weeks ago!

So, set out with a fresh oil, a valve adjustment (and
new adjusters for a whopping $6.95!) and fingers
crossed yesterday morning. Got back late today, 450+
miles and several tanks of gas later with absolutely
*no* problems (ok, we got lost and ended up in
California instead of Nevada, but that's not the
busses fault!;-).


Along the way, we stopped in Seligman, Az., where they
were holding a Route 66/classic car show. Got to see
some truly cool old cars, from stock restorations, to
hot-rods, to trailer queens. Only one air-cooled VW,
though, but it was COOL! A '70s ragtop bug converted
to a baja, but truly show-worthy. It was purple in
color and pulling a matching purple mini-trailer. It
also had an air-horn from a semi that brought endless
rounds of laughter from all that witnessed it! Also
saw a New Beetle complete with flames painted on the
front, talk about style!

The coolest by far was a miniature 1939 Chevy Sedan
(hey, I already got the necessary Bus content!) that
some guy built by HAND! He looked at the full size
Ch3vy and scaled it down so that he could use TRAILER
tires and wheels and built the entire thing to scale!
This thing looks absolutely real until you get
up-close and see how small it is (I'm 5'10&quot; and it
only comes up to my belt!). It was a riot watching
this guy race it up and down the street (don't know
what motor it had, but I wouldn't race him for
&quot;pink-slips&quot;!!!!!!


Sorry for the bandwidth, but it was a great time and I
wanted to share it. Anyone travelling through Northern
Arizona should really drive down Route 66, it's
beautiful and you won't have people pissed off at you
for driving too slow!
