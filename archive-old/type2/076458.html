Subject: Re: [T2] Front Shift Rod Bushing Replace

 
--Travis,

Did this last week on my 76.

1. remove gearshift assembly held by two bolts on floor. take it out as an assembly and note how it's put together so you get it back right.

2. under bus, find point where the two shift rods (front/rear) meet each other and are held together with a coupling/setscrew. remove safety wire on setscrew, remove setscrew and slide coupling forward. it will take a little wiggling to work the front rod out so you can replace the bushing. the rod is bent by design so don't be worried if you see it's crooked.

3. WARNING: the bentley shows the earlier bay front shift rod bushing arrangement where apparently the bushing goes inside the shift rod (list?), the later bushing seats in a circular hole in a piece of vertical sheet metal and goes around the shift rod.

4. Lube the inside of the bushing. reinstall shift rod under bus, it's really not hard.

5. reinstall gearshift assembly and be prepared to adjust per bentley.

Note: My front bushing was missing entirely and my shifting has been worse since doing the procedure. I believe I may need to replace the rear bushings (2) also. Would the list care to comment?

&gt;Hello All -
&gt;I have a 79 bus.  Recently I acquired a new front shift rod bushing (a.k.a.
&gt;shift guide) to replace the mangled, sloppy-shifting-causing rubber/plastic
&gt;disc thing that is up in there now, hanging by a thread if still there at
&gt;all.  Looking at the old bushing some time ago, I assumed that a replacement
&gt;would involve just greasing up the new bushing and sliding it into the
&gt;&quot;peace pipe&quot; end of the shift rod, working it in so that it seals correctly
&gt;into its groove.  But, someone just told me that it is much more involved
&gt;that that -- as in having to somehow loosen/disconnect the shift rod and
&gt;slide it back in order to get/fit the bushing in there.  Is this true and if
&gt;so, can someone step me through this process?  I don't want to get under
&gt;there and start unbolting rods willy-nilly without having some guidance to
&gt;work from.  Thanks for your help!
