Subject: Re: Peterson's Field Guide to Loaf ID

One thing I've noticed is a change in the shape of the rear air intake 
ducts in the early 70s.  Early loaves have cresent-shaped vent, later 
ones have larger, more rectangular ones.  I suspect this corresponds to 
the introduction of the pancake engine.

There's also the bit about the flare above the forward wheel well--dunno 
what year that starts with, tho'...
