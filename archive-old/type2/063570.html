Subject: Re: Oil Temp. Sender Question

&gt;
&gt;  Purists will cringe, but I mounted my gauge on the top of the dashboard
&gt;with a single piece of duct-tape.  This performs two vital functions: it
&gt;holds the gauge down securely without drilling any holes in the dash, and
&gt;it looks so good and ugly and *cheap* it will hopefully discourage anyone
&gt;from breaking into the camper to steal stuff.

        I opted for the drain plug sender,in hopes of better accuracy, and
the fact that it was cheaper. However, after seeing Tobin's duct tape
installation, I had the inspiration to copy him. This was due in part to
the fact that my guage was installed at a rest stop somewhere south of
Denver... Someday I intend to install it where the optional clock went.

Peace,
