&gt; What weight of oil should I be using in my 1971 1600dp Westy. Right

&gt; I am using 10/40.
&gt; Thanks for any input.

 Depends how cold it gets round your way, but probably thicker than
that.
 I use straight 30W (Castrol CRI30 or Morris) year round. AM temps in 
winter don't usually go under -10C, Summer rarely peaks over 30C, Mostly
it's between 0C and 20C.

Cheers,
