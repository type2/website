Today at lunch I drove by an old 70 Westy that had been sitting for a long
time. In fact almost two years ago I pulled the pop-top off for my 70
standard. Anyway, I went out and looked it over and found that the whole
interior, while still there, was totally shot. So, I pulled ever piece of
plastic t molding I could. I got a whole bunch. I pulled all the doors so I
got the handles too. I also got the side table. The other cool thing I got
was the front door handles had these aluminum protectors behind them, so I
grabbed them too. I asked the guy how much, he said &quot;just take it&quot;. So it
cost me nothing. I have looked and looked for good t moldings and not found
any. I also pulled a bunch of Formica off the  rotten cabinets to fix a few
chipped spots. All in all, a good bunch of stuff for free.
