Subject: Re: Deep Cycle Marine Batteries?? and aeroshell oil

I agree, , , , , ,

I always thought that Marine batteries would be great for the 2nd battery
in a camper setup, But found that they are intended to be run flat then re-
charged. This is not what the automobile charging system does. It keeps it
charged all the time. Just spend $50 bucks on a small lead acid battery and
use it till it won't recharge any more, then just get a new one. That's also the
least expensive way to do it.

BTW, , ,  I recomember using AeroShell oil in my veedubs. It was designed
for air cooled engines.

Any comments about that?

&gt; Thought I'd add $.02 (Canadian, = $.01 US) worth.  Don't use a marine
&gt; battery.  They're made to be discharged to the bottom before charging.  You
&gt; want something that will keep a charge for a long time.
