Subject: rear door alignment

Finally got the rear hatch window seal and the rear hatch seal replaced on
my 74 Westfalia just before the snows hit...the window went in pretty well
- tore a couple of chunks off the inner lip of the seal where my wife was
pulling on the rope because the fit was tight and the rubber cold, but it
doesn't look like it will affect the fit or the seal at all, and it's
holding water so far.

However, the hatch seal still leaks a bit, and I noticed today the
probable cause for this - the rear door is slightly misaligned - the edge
of the lump that runs horizontally across the back of the bus is about
2-3mm higher on the right side of the door compared to the lump on the
body panel. Additionally, while the door sits flush at the bottom edge,
the sides are not flush - probably 2-3mm again out from the body. 

The door may be misaligned because the PO used to carry a couple of bikes
on the back door, but anyway, how would I go about realigning? From the
hinges up on the inside roof of the van? 

Thanks
