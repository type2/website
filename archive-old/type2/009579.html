&gt;4. multi-weight oils are a blend. when you heat them, the volitaile stuff

&gt;of stuff), yer prolly better off running a single weight appropriate for
&gt;each season in your area, as you won't really NEED an oil that will 'go
&gt;&gt;from 20F to 80F.'  change when it becomes mainly cold, and again in summer.

	I hate to disagree with Craig, but its NOT SO. Multi-wieghts are not 
blends, they're the lower-numbered stock with nifty polymerizing agents
 added to them that make them behaive LIKE THE HIGHER NUMBER AT TEMPERATURE. 
A case-full of new 20W-50, when at engine temperature, has the same 
viscosity as a case-full of 50W.  BUT it can be pumped like 20W when cold. 
Such a deal! (note 20W-50, bus engines work hard)

	The neato chemicals that cause this degrade much faster than
the base oil, however, so that after about 3x00 miles of normal driving
in a 'normal' water cooled engine, pretty much all the additives
are gone and your sump is filled with just plain lower-number base stock.

	If you change every 3000 miles, you get the low-temp ease of pumping
and quick lubrication, minimizing start-up wear, AND the same-as-high-number 
viscosity and lubrication at full temperature.

	If you change every 1500 miles, recomended for aircooleds, the
additives are always fresh and you get all the benefits with no risks. 
20W-50 is going to be better oil over the long run in an aircooled than
straight 30 or even straight 40.
