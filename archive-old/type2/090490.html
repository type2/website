&gt; Thanks to all who replied to my cry of distress.

You're welcome! :-)

&gt; Today I began to apply the DM (Dolan Methode) to my
&gt; &quot;non-bleedable brakes.&quot;

I must say.....  EEEEWWWWWWW!!!!  Can we use SSM? (simple stupid method)?
That is what I feel I am capable of.  No way can I advertise to be a pro,
just a shade tree mechanic who keeps having to return to basics.

&gt; The rear shoes were two click less than wheel locked, as I normally
&gt; adjust, but the fronts were completely retracted!  I guess that's
&gt; where I left off six years ago..................No wonder the pedal
&gt; was soft after bleeding!

Err.... yeah :-)  That would explain it :-)  Your description of the
symptoms (no brakes on the first press, some after a couple quick strokes
of the pedal) was classic for either air in the lines or for brakes badly
out of adjustment.

&gt; Isn't it amazing how the brain fades with years of drug
&gt; abuse and abnormal sexual practices?

Hey!  I resemble that remark! :-)  My only dissapointment is that they
lied to us... I am still waiting for the flashbacks I was promised!
(other than the ABBA musical, puh-LEEZE! :)
