Subject: [T2] Removing Engine Lid
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;Can anyone give me a run-down on how to remove the engine lid for a '72 bus?
(AND the &gt;re-installation) I checked the library and the archives, but to no
avail.

If you work on the street be prepared to be out there until its done. I used a
3/8 drive
electric drill and a few bits. I drilled out the center rod in each hinge - took
awhile
then when it was time to reinstall, I broke the head off some appropriate size
carpenter
nails, greased and drove them in with a hammer. This method won't win any &quot;best
of show&quot;
awards, but if your bus is a workhorse it will be just fine.
