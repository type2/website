Subject: Re: [T2] RELIABLE kit source for conversion of '71 to LPG?

tanksvw asked:

 Hi there. I've been away from the list for quite some time. But I'm back now, and after searching the
archives and to hell and back on the www, I have a question.

Does anyone know of a _reliable_, tested source for LPG conversion kits for a 1971 camper? I'd like to get
everything I need, perhaps minus the tank/s (shipping ouchy), in a kit rather than cobbling something
together.

Any helpful information will be greatly appreciated. Any snide remarks about converting my bus to LPG will be
cheerfully ignored. ;-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

People in the UK use LPG. But the island is small so the tank is small......

Here in the US, you will have to figure on going 200 miles niles between fill ups. You will have a problem
finding a place in your bus to put a big enough tank......

I believe Bob Hoover was working on doing LPG but also ran into the tank problem.
