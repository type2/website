&lt;&lt; What I suspect (and you heard it here first...) is that sooner or later, 
cars
&gt;are gonna get a legislated mandatory retirement age based on either mile-
&gt;age or years or a combination of both...

Don't they do that in Japan already hence the availability of &quot;cheap&quot; 
replacement engines from there?

Pretty sure I agree with you about the &quot;retirement policy&quot; in Japan,
but the availability of the engines is questionable...I remember a few
sites that advertised &quot;those&quot; engines some years ago for a buddy with
a Japanese pickup but they seem to have disappeared (or I can't find
'em)...
Switzerland is another country with a strict &quot;inspection&quot; system that
effectively limits the age (and appearance !) of locally registered cars...
