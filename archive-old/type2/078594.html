Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable replacement help



&gt; Replaced the clutch cable in anticipation of new clutch and complete
&gt; engine rebuild. Found the Flexible guide tube (Bordon tube) was worn
&gt; out. See Bently page52 figure 15-16. Proceeded to replace it and 
found
&gt; the 2 bolts that hold the bracket that holds this tube had stripped 
the
&gt; holes in the trans or they were simply the wrong size??? Can't see in
&gt; the bolt holes to inspect the threads. The bolts that came out of 
these
&gt; holes have 8mm threads. Is this correct? Thinking about Helicoil. 

Yes, 8mm sounds right.  I had one of these pull out on me and I put in 
a helicoil.  You can use whatever insert suits your fancy.  This is a 
job to do with the tranny out of the bus.  Take care when drilling the 
holes out as common twist drills will tend to grab and advance in this 
alloy.
