Subject: Bus No Start/Addendum

Hello All,
I posted a couple weeks ago concerning the no-start state of my 79 FI bus, 
which had been sitting and was rarely driven for some time.  Has relatively 
new (1-year-old) battery and starter.  Always started fine without a hitch 
until recently, but suddenly now I cannot get it to turn over -- that is, I 
get nothing when I turn the key.  Had the battery tested and charged; still 
no go.  When I attempted to jump-start it, it would turn over fine (and 
strongly) but would not ignite.  After twice cleaning and tightening all 
battery power/ground connections -- and after disconnecting my auxiliary 
battery from the bus completely -- subsequent attempts were unsuccessful.  I 
did a coil test and got a weak orange spark, so I replaced that.  When I 
then tried to jump-start it, she fired right up.  (Cool, don't have to call 
AAA.)  But, on its own without the assistance of a jump battery, it still 
won't turn over.  I've noticed that without a jump battery, when I turn the 
key the dashboard lights come on very dim and slowly increase in brightness 
(but never reach their normal level), which seems unusual.  Its almost as if 
its taking the power a long time to arrive from the battery.  This AM I had 
the battery tested again, and it checked out fine.  Anyway, now I'm at a 
loss.  I know that when I last posted I received some great testing steps 
from some kind folks here, and I will continue to try them out as time 
allows.  However, for now I just wanted to throw these current symptoms out 
there to see if they point to anything obvious for anyone.  I appreciate 
your input, as always!  Thanks.
