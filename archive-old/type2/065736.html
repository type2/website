Subject: Flywheel System Logic (was Eric Rainey)

&gt;Flywheel system:
&gt;
&gt;The idea is a flywheel ( a wheel with very large mass, much larger than the
&gt;flywheel currently in your bus) stores energy.
&gt;
&gt;As it now exists, a high-efficiency gas turbine produces electricity.  This
&gt;juice is used to speed up the flywheel(to very, very high rpm) and to turn
&gt;electric motors which turn the wheels at cruising speeds.  When you step on
&gt;the accelerator, both the turbine and the flywheel generate plenty o' amps
&gt;to make the car increase its speed, and this acceleration can be very quick
&gt;indeed (Mercedes claims its flywheel system can go 0-60 in 6.0s,
&gt;acceleration like this  is way beyond the imagination of any bus owner).
&gt;
&gt;The added advantage of the flywheel is that it recovers energy lost in
&gt;braking (a very, very large amount of energy if you think about it).  The
&gt;way it works is like this: the drive wheels don't have any brakes.
&gt;Instead, when you hit the break, the motors reverse polarity and become
&gt;generators, producing electricity which is then stored in, you guessed it,
&gt;the flywheel.
&gt;
&gt;Now if a big-ass, high-performance (i.e. low efficiency) Mercedes can get
&gt;40 mpg, imagine what a honda civic could get with a flywheel system!
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps,
&gt;Eric

  I guess i'm commenting on the smoke and mirrors? 

 All those moving, twirling, lectrifying and now the other way
 Batterys and rectifiers and relays and wiring bearings and 
generator/motors. what is that, about five at least.
 I know deep in my heart that somewhere there is a Control System.

 And We All Know What That Means!   Stuff that Smokes!

 and they are gettting 40 mph.  Mercedes  -  I have personally seen 
some real engineering from those guys. they're good.

 Forgive me for being judgemental but I don't think I can afford
40 mph using this evolution of engineering.      west
