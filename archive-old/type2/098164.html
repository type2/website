Steve,

Try:

http://www.everybus_dot_com/dworkin/wendelin/

I did some restructuring on my server, things moved :-(  (Matt, feel free
to move this whole directory over to the library for permanent placement,
eh?)

Let me follow this with a general comment....  I write a bunch of stuff.
some of it is useful, I hope.  Every once in a while someone will write me
and ask me to write it up for the library.  I am trmedously complemented
that someone thinks it useful, but....

I ain't gonna.  I write and answer as the mood strikes me.  I'll sit and
hammer something out if I know it and the phase of the moon is right, etc.
etc.  But!  Long term effort and I are not good friends :-( If you wait
for me to sit, plan and do html, then keep breathing :-)  I have more
half-finished pages lying around on my server and hard drive that Carter's
got little liver pills!  I don't know what it is, but finishing things is
just not my talent.

At the same time, I have *no* problem with anyone who sees something I
wrote as valuable making a page of it and sending it in to the library!
hell, you can even put your name on it!  Just so you don't ask for money
for it, I have no problem (old socialist that I am :-)
