Ric,
Here's a trick that might work for you.
1. pull the cable out.
2. get a ball of string and at the loose end attach some tissue or something
that is just the size of the hole of the pipe you have to fish it down.
3. get your vacuum and tape the hose to the other end making a good seal.
4. pay out enough string to go from front to back
5. locate the vacuum switch near where you are feeding the string or have
someone turn it on by command.
6. switch the vacuum on
7. watch the string BLAST through the tube.
8. attach the string to the accellerator cable
9. pull the cable through using the string.

Its amazing how fast the string will be pulled through the tube.  Don't burn
your hand feeding it.

I've used this method to feed string through runs as short as 10 feet and as
long as 400'
