Hi Brian,

&gt; I plan on changing from reg oil to synthetic(Any thoughts?) 

Synthetic oil costs much more and lasts much longer than regular oil. But 
unfortunately with a VW Type 1 engine you will never experience the benefit 
of the long lasting oil because you will still be changing the oil at 3000 
miles. In our engines the oil is not changed because it is worn out but 
because it is dirty and a synthetic oil will get dirty just as quick as a 
regular oil.
Seriously the biggest effect will be on your wallet.

&gt;  and I think i read
&gt;  somewhere that my doghouse oil cooler (1971 westy) must be replaced.  Is
&gt;  this so? I guess it makes sense.  

If your oil cooler is in good condition there is no reason to change it. But 
if your money runs to it having a new one will give you some peace of mind.

&gt;  Also do you guys have any opinions on
&gt;  full flow oil kits(filter, cooler, thermostat,maxi pump etc).  I wanted
&gt;  to run a full flow kit to get the extra cooling and filtering but the
&gt;  muir book says they are not worth it.

Well I've got 13,000 miles on a brand new 1600 dual port (with the FI system 
as fitted to Mexican Beetles) and the other day I drove continuously at 60mph 
for two hours got out and felt the engine lid which was stone cold. I know 
from experience that if I were to hold the top of the dip stick after this 
sort of run it would only be warm. If I sniff the air in the intakes it 
doesn't smell hot there either. 
Also remember that if your engine does not ever get properly warm it will 
never be working at its correct efficiency.
So, in my opinion, extra coolers are not necessary, but also remember I live 
in UK which is a temperate climate - if I lived in Arizona, Texas or Florida 
my opinion may be different.

Good luck
