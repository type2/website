Hi Don,

It appears that VW is back to using &quot;Hired Guns&quot; to restrict the use  
of their intellectual property.

Rather than talk to their lawyers, I think it would be a lot better  
if we (as a group) were able to voice our opinions to their marketing  
and sales people. If you can post a link to THOSE people, it might  
get more attention from VW.  The hired gun lawyer surely expects to  
bear the brunt of our outrage, but the sales and marketing people  
probably don't.

Besides which, I think that you might be able to prove fair use as  
parody, as there is clearly humor in the attachment of the &quot;Not  
compensating&quot; taqgline. But I'm not a lawyer.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Sounds to me like they aren't happy about it either.
&gt;
&gt; I know there was some new law passed recently relating to Trademark
&gt; Dilution, but I'm wondering if my &quot;Not Compensating&quot; stuff qualifies
&gt; as Fair Use : Social Commentary? I'm gonna do a bit of research. Any
&gt; help would be appreciated (off list, of course).
