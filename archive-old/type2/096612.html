Subject: popping from webers


hello list.


I recently had a pair of weber 34ICTs installed in my bus. they run
awesome, good acceleration, good power all around. the only thing is that
when you are giving the bus gas there is a weird popping sound coming from
the right carb. my mechanic said it might be something in the distributor.
He said to try the 009 that I told him i have. 

Ive heard that it is not a good thing to put a 009 dizzy in a type4. If i
recall it messes up the powerband for the bus.

my setup is as follows: 
'74 westy
1800cc type 4 engine originally FI, switched to dual solex, now with
weber 34icts
tranny is out of a '72 bus....also a note on this:

I really like this setup of the 1800 with the gearing of the 72 tranny.
its not as fast on the highway..but she climbs noticably better than the
'78 tranny i had in there. I think i will look for these older '72-'74
transaxles
from now on. and even better, the bellhousing fits up with the 215mm
flywheel. less work and better climbing ability..... not as fast but i
like to be in my bus for a while :)


anyways...does anyone know what my popping could be? the valves are all in
correct adjustment, the timing is set dead on (7.5 BTDC (i
tihnk...whatever bently says to set it at, its at)... also the power is
good but not perfect..... my mechanic said the popping had something to do
with that too. 

should i go with the 009 and see if that fixes it? where should i time the
009 at?


thanks in advance
