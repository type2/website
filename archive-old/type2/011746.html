i have those happy looks happen all the time.   i cant
count the number of peace signs that ive been flashed
as well as smiles.  two ones i remember in particular
was a couple high school kids driving past waving and
holding up a bag of, well, you know...and another was
on our trip east this summer when we were pulling out
a rest area, we were going past a family with a little
girl about 4 who looked up at me, gave me the thumbs
up and said &quot;cool bus!&quot;  at least i know some parents
out there are raising there kids right:)

as a side note, the 68 westy is gone as of today.  sol
herrera of the list came up with his son from kansas
and it is on its way to its new home where it will be
back on the road shortly, another one saved!  this
list is great by the way, Sol was just another super
friendly listmember i had the pleasure of meeting.  
have a good weekend.

&gt;    Well in just the last few months we've had a lot
&gt; of people take notice of 
&gt; out present bus in a positive way.  We've had a
&gt; stranger step off the curb 
&gt; while we were stopped at a traffic light and ask to
&gt; buy our bus.  We've also 
&gt; had people pull up next to us on the highway, while
&gt; doing 50-60 miles per 
&gt; hour, and ask if we wanted to sell our bus.  The
&gt; best of all is when  teens 
&gt; and kids shout stuff at us as we go by.  Usually
&gt; it's something like &quot;cool 
&gt; car&quot; or &quot;hey I like your van&quot; and one time it was
&gt; &quot;radical ride man&quot;.  The 
&gt; funniest was when a comment came from a girl who was
&gt; riding in the back of 
&gt; her mom's luxury SUV.
