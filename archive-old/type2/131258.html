Subject: Re: [T2] Removing gutters

That's beautiful! Why hadn't I thought of that? I even have a remote
starter!!!!

I was laying under there yesterday wishing I could reach the wrench on the
pulley nut so I could watch the rockers while I turned the engine. LoL!!!

&lt;smacks head&gt;

Thanks!
Don

&gt; Karl has the situation down pat--and no one has ever explained the job
&gt; so eloquently-- and easy to grasp--.
&gt;
&gt; Follow these instructions and you'll get the job done right the first
&gt; time--and that will be the end of that task for now--
&gt;
&gt; Hope you didn'y glue them gaskets on--:&gt;)
&gt;
&gt; Hasta,
&gt;
