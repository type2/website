&gt;Not nearly the same thing.  The Honda/Toyota hybrids are conventional cars

Uh, the Honda has a &quot;sandwich&quot; motor/generator but I don't think the Prius does - I think it is a more conventional setup as it is a much larger motor (44hp).  I could not find any information on the web to confirm this though.

&gt;Oddly enough, the conventional VW TDI diesel gets nearly the same mileage
&gt;with a lot less complexity.

It's an amazing engine - wish I had one in my bus.  The Prius drivetrain is still much cleaner though, if you're into that.

&gt;A full hybrid design puts motors in the wheel hubs, eliminating the
&gt;entire mechanical drive train and braking system.

Well, that is a wonderful concept, but the Prius/Insight are by definition Hybrids.

 From Dictionary_dot_com: &quot;A power plant having two kinds of components that produce the same or similar results&quot;.

&gt;  You gain a more complex
&gt;electrical system, but you lose the transmission, differential, drive
&gt;shafts and hydraulic braking systems.  You also get AWD, since you need
&gt;to put motor/generators on all four wheels for braking.  Unfortunately,
&gt;this approach is much more unconventional and therefore unattractive to
&gt;manufacturers.

I'm still praying that someday the technological challenges of this method will be overcome and we will get vehicles like this.  A 60hp electric motor at each wheel would be very interesting!  But in the meantime, who will be the first to put a Prius drivetrain in a bus?  Sounds like a good project for a highschool physics class.  :)
