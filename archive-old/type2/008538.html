Howdy,       I've been doing some cleaning, rearranging, and storing of
various VW parts I've collected over the years.  Found some for my old '
69 bug, and a lot for the bus.  As usual they were gathering dust in the
most obscure and strange places.  The more I read the posts here, the
more I want to dig in to my bus, updating and replacing worn out
parts.......mostly preventative maintenance, but I think I'll wait ' til
the weather warms a bit (concrete floor warms a bit).   Anyway, I've
found a couple belts that I'm trying to I.D.  I have a ' 77 2.0L FI, and
I can't seem to get the numbers from the belt on my bus.  I thought I'd
call a parts house, but then why bother them if I don't plan to
purchase...       The numbers on the belts are 9.5 x 905 L and made by
Continental.  I know one or several of you have these numbers in your
head.......I don't!
Are these belts most likely for my ' 69 bug, or for the bus?  I either
have a couple spares, or some belts I don't need........or could they be
for the ' 69 but would fit the bus?
Thanx,  Kevin  Snow
