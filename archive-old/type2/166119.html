Subject: Re: [T2] Engine cooling air

&gt; 	One idea I've toyed with is to slap a low-drag gauze on the
&gt; &gt;intake to the fan, and trickle water by gravity onto that from a
&gt; &gt;narrow pipe across its top with several holes during max-power
&gt; &gt;bursts.  The latent heat of evaporation of water is a peculiarly high
&gt; &gt;number  -  the basis of many simple tropical cooling systems  -  so
&gt; &gt;this should give the cooling fins cooler air.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	Having brutally hammered Darren's idea (perhaps thru
&gt; &gt;misunderstanding it)  I now brace myself for enrubbishments of mine.

I have thought about this too, but just using a mister. Look at
mistymate_dot_com. Attach a small pump and have it mist water into the air.
...just a thought.

Hm...  Seems like you could pull a lot of moisture into the engine that
way...  A bad thing?
