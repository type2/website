Subject: wiper interchangeability

To all my  fellow loafers:

I have a '68 single cab that has a &quot;stuck&quot; wiper motor. Fortunately for me 
I have two good junk yards that usually has a good selection of loaf's(bay 
windows). I was just wondering if a later model wiper motor can be used 
because of the '68s unique wiper arms and the unlikely chance of finding a 
'68 wiper motor assy(mostly '70-77 Bays in these yards). Many thanks in 
advance!!
