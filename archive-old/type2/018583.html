 How about
&gt; repairing the existing one?Al Brase, did you post about this once?

Chris:
Yes I did! On my old 70 bus ($125 rescued from junkyard drove 50k
miles), the turnsignal/ dimmer switch was wagging on the column, causing
the wires to break off their connections on the switch. Took a bit of
logic and research to figure which one went where- or look at another
one- but is was really easier to resolder the wires to the switch than
to replace the whole damn thing. Of course, then you need to fix the
CAUSE of the problem, that is make the switch tight to the column. The
design is weak and the fix for me was to shim the switch with a strip of
wet-or-dry sandpaper (320 grit) under the mounting strap.
The switch on my double cab is borderline and I've developed a habit of
using two fingers to move the wand when signalling: one to move the wand
and one to hold the switch from moving. Works easily for me as I have
large, strong hands. Maybe not so easy for someone with smaller hands as
I push the wand right up by the housing.
Be forewarned: If your switch is loose, the wires will eventually break
off. I think they changed this design around 74-75.
