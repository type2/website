&gt;I think this is down to market variations. Bear in mind that the distinction

&gt;where regulation is generally tighter than here.

Law or not, I am waiting for someone to give me a good reason why drinking 
a soda in a car is less safe than smoking in a car.  Only difference that I 
can think of is that one will give you lung cancer.

&gt;  I happen to agree that eating, drinking, shaving, reading newspapers,
&gt;putting on makeup etc. are incompatible with UK driving conditions,
&gt;however that may not be the case in the US, VW have now adapted their
&gt;cars for that market and maybe Dr. Tim should acknowledge that.

Again, I am not suggesting that any of these things either are or are not 
safe to do while driving.  I am trying to focus on the reasoning behind the 
the lack of cupholders and non-lack of ashtrays in busses and other German 
cars.  My personal opinion is that the Germans are very strict with their 
laws (which is a good thing) but that they made an exception for smoking 
while driving because they are simply too entrenched/addicted/whatever to 
give it up.  I see this as a serious failure in their standard methodology, 
akin to Jimmy Swaggart having extramarital affairs while preaching about 
the evils of illicit sexual relations to the rest of the world.
