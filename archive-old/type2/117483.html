&gt; &gt;So... with that in mind... short of getting a new future wife, is there any
&gt; &gt;way to convince the SO to go on a camping trip. EVEN if it's just for one

&gt; 
&gt; I just had this experience with my wife and I just told her that she should
&gt; try it once and if she didn't like it that I wouldn't ask her to go camping
&gt; in the bus again.  It took some discussing and telling her that we have to
&gt; share some common hobbies, but finally she agreed and said that camping in
&gt; the bus wasn't nearly as bad as she thought it would be.

well my wife thought it was as bad as she thought it would be, so I came
to Everybus alone with her blessing,  didn't have to keep the van so neat
inside though and got to see more of other folks
