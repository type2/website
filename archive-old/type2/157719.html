Subject: intake boot

Try going to your flaps and see if they have the misc hardware for fabbing a
cold air intake for water cooled cars..
Mine has different elbows and pipes with plugged access holes for vaious vacuum
hookup requirements.. I would bet you could fabricate your own from these
parts.
Post up I will find out what the manufacturer's name is if anyone is interested
but doesnt have a flaps that carries this stuff.. though this day-n-age I cant
imagine they wouldnt
