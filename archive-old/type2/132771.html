Subject: Re: [T2] Timing light suggestions?

&gt;I'm looking to buy a timing light and would like product suggestions.
&gt;An indication of price range vs. (useless?) features would also help.

If I had to buy another one I would get one with a dial.  this makes it
easier to measure advance for pulleys with no degrees, and for other cars
besides VWs (such as my old BMWs).  I got mine used (Sunco I think) from a
listee for $30.  the desired one is similar to the craftsman with advance,
retails for $70.

Will A.
