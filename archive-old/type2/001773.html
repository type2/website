Here's what I think... I think you should work this out privately with
AVP.

What the heck is anybody on the list supposed to respond to since we
don't have the parts in hand to inspect ourselves?

By all accounts AVP is a responsible and responsive vendor; they've
offered to help you out with a problem that, if they're correct in
their assessment of the problem, is not their responsibility.  So what
are we supposed to do, chime in with a chorus of &quot;I've been driving
VW's for 30 years and NEVER had a piston go bad...AVP is a bunch of
scumbags!!!!&quot;????  The open-ended nature of your posting suggests to
me that that's the kind of response you're hoping to get, supposedly
putting pressure on AVP to buy you a new engine.

If you want to ask a specific question, e.g., &quot;has anybody had a
piston separate on them?&quot;, go ahead and ask.

&gt; hey volks,
&gt; well i finally got a response back from AVP today.
&gt; below is the email they gave me.  im not really sure
&gt; what to think and would like some input from the list
&gt; as to what you all think.  they feel that the piston
&gt; separated and caused the damage to the head, not the
&gt; other way around.  the piston in question is a new
&gt; brazillian set from Ron that was put in by a VW garage
&gt; and had less than 8000 miles on it and like the rest
&gt; of the engine was not overheated.  tell me what you
&gt; think?
&gt; thanks everybody

&gt; Mr. Bell, Hello,We received your head yesterday,and
&gt; did inspect it
&gt; closely.
&gt; Actually the picture was even clearer than the head.
&gt; What it appears to
&gt; have
&gt; happened is that the piston seperated,and when that
&gt; happens, the piton
&gt; hits
&gt; the valve and eventually makes the valve break. We
&gt; have been here 20
&gt; years,
&gt; and so far have never had a valve break. We are
&gt; willing to work with
&gt; you on
&gt; the head, and replace it for below cost, so you can
&gt; get back on the
&gt; road, the
&gt; cost would run $85. plus shipping.
&gt; Please call or e-mail, and let us know what you want
&gt; to do from this
&gt; point.
&gt; Thank-You, AVP 1-800-548-5766.
