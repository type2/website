Subject: Balancing wide 5's

Yes.  I have a 70 bus, this is a PITA issue.
I have found a solution after years of looking.

I bought an old Beetle front drum at a swap meet with the same wide 5 
pattern and 5 lug nuts for $10. I took it to the tire shop and got them to 
first spin it in their balancer to make sure it is balanced, with the 5 lugs 
in place. A front drum has the big hole for the wheel bearings, and most 
spin balancers shafts will fit into it.(check that first)

Then, in turn I bolted it to each of the wheels with the new tires on them 
using their air gun, and had them spin balance them. They humored me while I 
wasted their time.  :-)    I also watched them like a vulture so they 
wouldn't do a mickey mouse job of balancing like they tried to do after I 
did all that work.

You are never going to find any other way to do it except for balancing on 
the vehicle, which is great until you move a wheel to another spot on the 
bus.
The great thing is, once you find an old Bus or Beetle front drum, you can 
keep it as your balancing adapter. Mine's in the garage hogging valuable 
space...

You can install the tires without balancing them for a short time while you 
seek the front drum, just don't drive too much lest you cup the new tires.

I just purchased a new set of Hankook tires for our type II.  I am told by
the tire place that they could not balance them because the wheel hub was
too large for their machine.  Anyone ever run into this?
