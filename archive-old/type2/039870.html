Subject: Re: Gas valve / regulator -CHANGES COMING-they're here.

Hello listers, et. al:

I'm replacing the 1 1/2 gal. propane tank in my '76 Campmobile and have 
ordered a new one from a local RV dealer/parts supplier.  It's pricey ($56) 
compared to the Home Depot, gas grill type large tanks.  I'll be replacing 
the regulator and the gas line to the stove top too.  Might as well!

My local propane dealer refused to fill my tank last weekend.  Here in 
Washington State (perhaps it's a Federal reg too) the small tanks must be 
recertified after each 5 years.  Larger tanks are recertified after each 7 
years.  My tank was last certified in 1992 and could not be recertified.  
Large propane companies are, apparently, the recertifiing stations.  Our 
state Ferry System has regs on transporting RV's with propane tanks as well.

Best regards,

Walt Fogle

&gt;A good bet for gas valve/regulator/hoses etc. is your local gas company, or
&gt;bottled gas distributor. Also, have you got a gas appliance repair shop
&gt;nearby?He may be a few bucks cheaper. HOWEVER    Regulations governing gas
&gt;bottles and fittings have changed recently, as a look at the new bottles at
&gt;Home Depot will readily prove.[New fittings are externally threaded, and
&gt;larger-easier to attach, somewhat more fool-proof] You may wish to consider 
&gt;a
&gt;new tank, or a new fitting installed with the new valve, because one day
&gt;soon, they won't be filling the old bottles anymore.Peoples Gas is already
&gt;refusing to fill my old bottles, and as they run dry, they are  trash. 
&gt;Clock
&gt;is ticking.  So the guys at Peoples Gas here in St. Pete tell me.This could
&gt;be a major pain for you Westy owners, and I think you oughta look into 
&gt;this.
&gt;The huge numbers of new grills and bottles being sold all have the new
&gt;coupling setup, and all the gas guys are switching over.The gas dock here 
&gt;is
&gt;full of old-style-valve castoff bottles, some almost brand new. Bummer, 
&gt;huh?
