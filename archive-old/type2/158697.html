Subject: Sliding door not popping out

OK,

Finally, after six long years of stops and starts, the bus is running
great and almost ready to be put back on the road. Maybe one run in the
Connecticut VW Assn's folliage run before next year's camping season...

But I have a problem with the sliding door and now that I have another
problem I figured I'd ask before ordering parts or getting used stuff.

The sliding door has never &quot;popped&quot; open when you pull the handle. I've
always had to put my fingers on the rear part of the door, by the
sliding track, and pull out so it'll pop open. Same goes when closing
it. I have to make sure that I hold the back out until I get close to
closing the door and then slam it so it doesn't scrape up the sliding
track cover.

So last night when I was using the door the hinge apparently broke and
one of the washers holding it in place broke and it now is not closeable
and I can see the hinge is out of the track.

My guess was always that the back hinge must have a spring of some sort
that was broken and now that I have to replace it that will hopefully
fix the problem, but I'd like confirmation from you all that have been
there before. Is there anything else I should buy at the same time as
the back hinge assembly?
