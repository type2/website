Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Hatch Adjustment?

Hi,

There are three places where the rear hatch closed position can be adjusted.
At the hinge on each side and at the lock striker plate.

To prevent the lock striker plate from pushing the hatch to one side undo the two alan headed bolts which hold it on to the tail gate opening and remove it completely. Now close the tail gate - if it's central then just replace and adjust the striker plate.

If the door is not lined up correctly the loosen the two alan headed bolts that hold the hinge onto the tailgate on one side adjust the position of the hinge on the door tighten bolts and close tailgate. Repeat until that side is lined up correctly then do the other side.

If without the striker plate fitted you are getting a right left shift on the tailgate then it may be possible to adjust by packing between the hinge and the door. Any packing should be the full size of the contact area between hinge and door - eg a flat plate with two holes drilled for the bolts. [NB as the tail gate is quite awkward to grapple with on your own its unwise to completely remove both adjustment bolts on the same side at the same time...]

Once the door is hanging straight the striker plate can be refitted and adjusted in position so that the tailgate still hangs straight.

Also note the the alan bolts should be quite hard to undo and a 1m cheeter bar on the alan key is quite useful.

Good luck

&gt; Got a 71 Westy , the rear door is not that aligned (about 1/4 space on the
&gt; right side, the left that is almost touching the bus) the striker plate on
&gt; the door left side is really compressed compared to the right side one, that
&gt; one looks almost new. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thinking this might be a source for water coming in. Help....Anyone ever
&gt; adjusted one to get in more evenly aligned on both sides? 
&gt; 
&gt; The Bentley doesn't really explain this.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
