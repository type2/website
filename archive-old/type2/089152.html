Subject: [T2] New Engine


&gt; Also I am replacing my Engine and have decided on a VEGE unit.  I was
&gt; intending on replacing it with the original 1600 AD engine but I am
&gt; considering going for the 2L instead could anyone advise on what else I may
&gt; need to do to upgrade i.e new carbs etc. and any alternatives to VEGE?

Vega or Vegggie ?
Sounds like UK or Aussie ( or California :) ?
Definitely not Haynes ( Dustin Hoffman, &quot;Rain Man&quot;  :).
