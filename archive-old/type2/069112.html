Volks Folks,

I've been working on a deal for a '64 Crew Cab over the last week or two.  I
recieved the pictures in the mail on saturday and everything looks like it
was described.  I'll be flying out to Denver on Friday morning to pick up my
new toy!  Hopefully we will make it back late friday night or sometime
saturday morning.

If anyone sees a Crew Cab by the side of the road between Kansas City and
Denver please stop and lend a hand.  I'll give a full report upon my return.

- -Dan
