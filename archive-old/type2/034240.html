Subject: Automatic transmission: repair or convert ?

  My 77 westie has given me a not very nice Christmas
present this year: a blown torque converter seal!  she
was leaking a bit for as long as I've known her (7,000
mi), but it was tolerable until two weeks ago, when it
began to get worse and worse until one day there was
nothing to do but tow her to the only mechanic I know
who still works on aircooled.
    I've got two options, according to my mechanic:
 1. replace the seal, and hope it went due to age
alone, not some other problem that caused high
pressure that might blow the new seal.  
2.  Convert the bus to a standard transmission from a
donor.  On the pro side, a manual transmission would
be easier to find donor parts and easier to work on,
but would cost twice as much ($1000 approx) to do.
   Has anyone seen a pattern on auto transmission
behavior in this regard?
   Has anyone done the conversion on a late bus? any
comments on problems and procedure would be most
helpfull as I decide what to do.
  Searching the archives seemed to only turn up:
  A:  I love my automatic
  B:  Why would anyone want an automatic?

  Any advice would be appreciated.

  Thanks,
  Kailo (77 westie)
