Subject: leak down test

 I recently bought a leakdown tester. This is a pump with a gauge which one
can use to get info on how well the rings and valves seal.  The exact
difference between the info given by one of these versus a compression
checker is not clear to me. Nevertheless, I used it for the first time
tonight on a 1776 which I rebuilt and which I just got  running on a test
stand.

The results were discouraging. Evidently, one is supposed to get a vacuum
of about &quot;30 pounds&quot; and then monitor the rate of decrease of this value.
Regardless of how rapidly I pumped, I could never get a value better than
10 and it dropped to zero within two seconds.  This was so unnerving, I
tried it on another cylinder with the same result.

To check the tester, I plugged the end of the adapter with my finger and
indeed a single squeeze of the handle gave 30 pounds and this value held
until I released my finger.

The rings are new. The cylinders were honed. The ring gaps were arranged
according to Bentley. I poured alcohol in the heads and saw no evidence of
liquid leaking past the closed valves.

So, a few questions: Has anyone done this test on an ac engine? Can anyone
suggest a reason for the lousy result?
