&gt; CA plates with 'barely' expired tags gets no love from the cop.

his or yours???  if he had expired tags..
&gt;
&gt; Guy seems cool, but later reports a claim to my insurance saying he had right
&gt; of way.
&gt; Insurances will likely deny each other's claims, and I have liability only so
&gt; I'm a$$ out.
&gt;
&gt; I have a witness, but the cop didn't put him in the report because he left me
&gt; his phone number before the cop got there.

contact your agent if you have one, give him the witness name and number.
might talk to a lawyer if your neck is bothering you or even if it isn't
