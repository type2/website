RRRRRRrrr!  Wrongo!  The correct response is &quot;if it HAS A GAS LEAK it 
smells like gasoline.&quot;  The only time my bus smells like gas is (all 
together now) when_it_has_a_gas_leak.  I find it and fix it.  Maybe I'm 
unjustifiably freaked out about leaking fuel, but I'd rather be a bit 
paranoid than deal with the consequences of a gas leak meeting heat, 
flame, or spark.

Besides, gas vapour is bad for you, the environment, and--if the leak is 
bad enough--you will be paying money for gas you don't get to burn inside 
your engine's combustion chambers.

(And now, a word from my mother...)
Oy, oy, oy, enough with the gas smells already!  You're makin' your mamas 
crazy with worry!  Make your mother happy, if you're not going to go to 
medical school, a least keep your car respectable...  ;-)
