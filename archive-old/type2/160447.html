Subject: S boot redesign

Could we also try to eliminate/reduce the vibrations that CAUSE the cracks 
in the &quot;S&quot; boot? And perhaps handle the vibrations differently?  We can't 
very well reduce the actual motions and vibrations of the engine.

The boot connects the fixed structure of the AFM/airfilter to the vibrating 
and moving throttle body of the engine.  It soaks up all the engine motion 
and isolates the AFM/airfilter from that motion. And in about 30 years it 
hardens  and cracks.

Maybe we could mount the AFM/airfilter directly on the engine, with a few 
shock-absorbing bushings, resembling motor or transmission mounts. The &quot;S&quot; 
boot could still be used, but would have less or different vibrations to 
absorb.  It might last 40 years that way.

Another idea would be to change the vibration rate of the &quot;S&quot; boot by 
making it from a material that isn't as likely to crack............perhaps 
of cast silicone rubber. This would  probably be less complicated than 
redesigning the fixation of the AFM/airfilter.

I come away thinking 30 years was a pretty good design life, and I'd like 
to be able to get another one just like it that good.
