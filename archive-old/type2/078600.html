&gt; How does that work, Jim ?
&gt; You can fill with mig wire and gas torch on a vertical surface ?
&gt; Does this require a fairly delicate touch ? Without the benefit
&gt; of shield gas from the mig, is there more heat ? And do you quench ?
&gt; ( Inquiring minds want to know :)

This takes some practice, but it's doable. It's almost a soldering job.

You start by adjusting your flame down to the barest minimum you can get it
to. Then you point your flame so it's not pointed at the bus, but so you can
get it to the bus just by turning your wrist. Pointing up or pointing down,
it works either way. You will have the MIG wire in your left hand and your
torch in the right.

Next, heat the MIG wire almost to the melting point. This is why you need a
very gentle flame; MIG wire melts quick. When it's almost ready to melt,
touch it to the ding and bring the flame to it. The wire will melt and fill
in the ding, pulling a bit of the base metal in along with it.

I don't quench because you're only heating the base metal for a couple of
seconds anyway.

I have a feeling you could do the same thing with lead-free solder, but in
that case the technique would be different--stick the end of the solder in
the ding and heat it until the solder melted.

(Ding = hailstone dent, de-rusted rust spot, whatever you have that's not
big enough to be a genuine dent.)
