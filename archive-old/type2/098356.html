&gt; &gt;The hot air is not warmed by the exhaust, but by the cylinder finning.  I

&gt; High pressure air off of the cylinders vs. low pressure area near muffler?

I doubt that the air picked up by the tube has any pressure in it at all.
It may be that the choice of heat source was simply to keep a more compact
engine package and to allow flexibility in exhaust system configuration.
