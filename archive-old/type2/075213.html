This is a great idea, and I think I'll finally subscribe this time. But I
can't find them on BudDepot. Ron, do you guys have 'em? Have you already
shipped my order? If not add one on.

Bus Depot had them last I checked.  I finally went to the locking kind
though.  It is exactly like the stock non-locking except for the tumbler in
the center.  I have seen some oddball non-stock looking types in use, but
the BD locking type looks stock.  With the locking gas cap, I no longer have
to buy a cap every 3 months.  Mine has never been stolen, just left at the
gas pump. I now keep the key on the ignition key ring and this does wonders
for stupidity prevention...least in my case.

&gt;Volks, does anyone have a gas cap (non-locking) for a '77 bus that I can
&gt;purchase? I talked to
&gt;my local supplier and was told they are NLA, (even through Motorworks).
This
&gt;sucks, and my bus is a molotov coctail waiting to happen.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
