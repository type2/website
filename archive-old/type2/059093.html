This makes me think more of corrosion then poor handling (I suppose mainly do
to the excellenct &quot;in snow&quot; performance of a Bus).

Anyway, I am curious if anyone on the list has any experience/opinions on the
following:

I am currently involved in panel replacement on a certain vehicle I have that
has a Type IV engine nearly like that of my Bus.  I went to the autobody
store
yesterday and asked what to put on steel panels for corrosion resistance in
harsh environments, like say January in Minneapolis.  They suggested using a
two-part self etching primer, and on top of that, a two part Urethane coating
that is often used as a spray-in pickup truck bed liner.  

I then thought that may also be a good coating system for the underside of my
Bus, so it could be driven year-round in Minnesota, when I eventually get back
there.

Does this sound like a good idea, or will I end up with a horrible mess that I
cannot remove?

TIA,

Mike
