Subject: repost: Help diagnose my engine problem

Ooops - I forgot to say what kind of car.  78 westy - FI

--
I'm trying to figure out this problem.

I'll be driving my car along and then all of a sudden it'll go way lean
(i have an o2 monitor) and start bucking like crazy.  So, I pulled over
and let the car idle.  Then about 5 minutes the car will go back to
normal.  This will also happen while driving and it'll go lean and then
fix itself.

Now, the fuel pump has been making some weird intermittent noises
lately, so I'm thinking that it's the pump, or possibly a fuel blockage
(hopefully not).  However, today I was at my shop and we were playing
around with the pump and then I tried to start the car and it wouldn't
start.  My mechanic looked at the spark and said it was really weak, so
we tried another coil and it started up, but still ran rough.

This is pretty weird stuff.  I'm going to buy a couple coils tomorrow,
new points, new condensor, and see how it runs.  He is also going to
give me a new fuel pump because this one is only a year old.

Any thoughts?

Mike
