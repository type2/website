Subject: Re: Am I &quot;Screw&quot;ed?

&gt; I've always had good luck using an impact driver, It's a screw driver that
&gt; twists slightly when you hit the end of it with a hammer.  You get the
&gt; benefit of unscrewing and tapping at the same time.  Short of that I'd
&gt; suggest tapping the end of the screw with a hammer then trying to loosen
it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The screws that hold the tin onto my left cylinder head have apparently
&gt; &gt; become one with the head - I can't get them to budge.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any other suggestions for removing a stuck screw? Or am I right in
&gt; &gt; assuming that the screw and the head are now inseparably connected?
&gt;
If you don't mind destroying the screw, you could use a gizmo called a screw
extractor. Imagine a thread tap with absurdly coarse threads--like half a
thread per inch. You drill a hole of the correct size into the stuck screw,
put the extractor in a tap wrench, and turn it into the hole. I've yet to
find a screw this gadget can't un-stick. They come in sets to cover a range
of screw sizes. Hardware stores, FLAPS, Harborfreight, etc., should have
them.

Good luck...
