Subject: tire specs? whats a spec?

Well, seems like only 2 weeks ago we tried to explain--to each his own, and
props to the man for being on his own adventure, a roadtrip I wish I was on.
The value of reinforced sidewalls is not obvious while reading email, but it
becomes more relevant on mountain hairpin turns and in desert crosswinds.  I
drove for a few years on passenger car tires.  they'll get you down the
road.  A load index of 95 is adequate and corresponds to 1521 lb. at max
PSI.  On the bright side, a new 2-ply tire is loads better than an old
dry-rotted one!  and if the correct tires ever become a priority, they will
make good spares.

Tire shops will try to sell you whatever is on their shelf.  they don't
normally stock the best bus tire, and many &quot;counter sales&quot; folks are only
looking out for their best interests, not yours.  Granted, bus tires may be
a 'special order' but usually they can have them the next day.

I recently limped to a respectable mom-n-pop tire store in a very small town
after a blowout from a rotten 185R14C michelin XZX (just too old), and the
spare was rotten also and barely made it the 14 miles (not my bus).   That
shop refused to sell me even a Load Range C that they didn't think was the
right size.  I had to make it to the show that night, so I crossed my
fingers and limped a few blocks across town to buy a pair of Load Range B
185R14's from a less-diligent shop (the only other one) just so I could get
out of that town.  I still respect the first shop's opinion.  But I was
desperate to leave that place and did what I had to do.  Like I said, not my
bus.
