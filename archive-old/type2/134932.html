Subject: Re: [T2] NGK plug for FI bus?

Joe
As small hint about the CHT sender/sensor ,,if your statement is refering to the
&quot;binding to the plug threads&quot; that sometimes occurs while installing the CHT
sensor,,  you can use a round file or a dremel on the inside of the large hole,,
open it up a tiny bit.. it makes it really easy to install... the actuall temp
sensor part is inside the crimp and will not be altered in any way.
I put a small notch in the tin at the same time,, this allows the sensor wire to
sit in the tin notch,  alongside the plug socket, the slightly larger hole
allows the sensor to remain still while the plug is going around, threading in.
Hope that helps
