Subject: Re: I need a Trailor Hitch

Charlie:

My hitch (for '78 2.0 bus) was purchased back around 1980.  Don't recall
the specs - they may be marked on it, but it's out in the shed right
now.

It's not a very complicated affair.  It's a tongue with a hole for the
ball.  The forward end rests below the transverse motor mounting beam
and is affixed thereto with a couple of u-bolts.  The rear end has a
short cross piece that bolts to the bottom of the bumper.  And a couple
of welded on rings for the safety chains.  That's all there is to it.

My '78 owner's manual says that a trailer without brakes can be up to
1,322 pounds.  For a trailer with brakes, it's 2,645 pounds with a
manual transmission, and 1,763 pounds with an automatic.

In all instances, the permissible trailer tongue weight at the hitch is
110 pounds.

The tongue weight is what concerned me because that weight's being borne
by the bumper.  My trailer is a light weight Cox with a 14' sailboat on
it.  The whole rig is probably not much more than 600 lbs, but I had to
diddle with axle location and bunker positioning in order to keep the
tongue weight down.

A footnote in the owner's manual says &quot;trailer weights listed are in
accordance with maximum vehickle engine and brake capacity on gradients
up to 16%.  The maximum permissible trailer weights depend also on the
weight rating specified by the manufacturer of the trailer hitch.&quot;
