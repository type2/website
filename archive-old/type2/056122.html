Jan, hopefuly it's something easy, like we had this spring. Lifter stuck in
the bore, sounded god-awful and thought a rod was about to come through the
case. Whilst knocking, put a large screwdriver to the engine and your ear,
and see if you can isolate the area (outboard mostly a &quot;better' position).
If it IS a lifter, easy, free fix. Good luck, Marv Krupp &amp;8 loaf/72 squished
