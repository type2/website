BIG generation gap--had the same conversation about Ralph Nader and
New Coke, none of the college freshmen knew about either---very scary.
As for Corvair parts, have you tried some of the Chevy sites on the net?
Some may laugh, but it's worth a shot.  At least your Westy isn't confused
as some sort of Corvair like my Ghia!

Subject: Corvair style air seals


&gt;Howdy all. Anyone know where I can get my greasy little paws on a set of
&gt;Corvair style spark plug wire air seals for my ' 78 2.0L Westy? I know I'll
&gt;have to modify them a bit, from reading Hoover's story in the archives, but
I
&gt;have no idea where to start looking for them. Tried my local FLAPS, and
they
&gt;laughed in my face. Of course, I first had to explain to the pimply faced
&gt;child behind the parts counter that Once Apon a Time the General Motors
&gt;Corporation actually made a car called a Corvair,(&quot;...with a six cylinder
Air
&gt;Cooled engine in the back!!???...No Way Dude!&quot;) but what can you do? Any
help
&gt;would be great. And I won't even go in to telling you what happend when I
&gt;tried to tell this kid who Ralph Nader was...
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Parker
