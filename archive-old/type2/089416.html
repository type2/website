I think it is time to rebuild the engine in Zeke (will be performing =
compression test tonight)  Everything else is set right, still does not =
run well under load.  timing, valves, points, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, =
carbs balanced etc.  Everything is in spec.  Anyways, does anyone sell a =
&quot;kit&quot; for an engine rebuild?  gaskets, bearings etc?  also in a previous =
post, it was stated that bosch makes a dizzy rebuild kit.  Does anyone =
know where to get one?

Thanks.
