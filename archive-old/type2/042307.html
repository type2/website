&gt;1) in the library, bartnik notes it is important to set the idle properly
&gt;before doing engine timing. muir has those steps reversed. which is
&gt;correct, please?

It should go in this order:
eliminate vacuum leaks
Set the valves
replace condensor
install points, wires, cap, rotor
set timing/check dwell
adjust carb
compression test, replace plugs
&lt;repeat as needed&gt;
