Subject: Re: [T2] alloy wheels

Turn the steering wheel all the way to the right. Look under the drivers side
from behind the wheel. You will see the speedo cable going into the center
between the two tubes. Grab the cable and try to pull it out, gently!! If it
comes out, the end is not connected.


&gt; just a quick question. the po or the po's po took off the regular wheels on
&gt; my 72 westy and put on alloys. my question is how can i check to see if my
&gt; speedo cable is still attached to the wheel without taking the wheel off (if
&gt; i can at all).
