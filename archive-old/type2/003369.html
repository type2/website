Subject: Busses for sale in S. Calif.

I'm moving out of state and unfortunately I have to sell some of my vehicles
/ projects  because I can't afford to move everything all the way across the
country.

Bus 1: 1969 7 passenger.  1600 single port,  remote mounted spin on oil
filter, body is good, paint is good, I have rear bumper but it's not
currently installed, interior is complete but the upholstery is only in
fair - poor  condition.  Runs good, driven weekly.  I'm asking $1950.00 OBO.

Bus 2. 1973 Westy (project).  Body is good, interior is mostly complete, has
tranny.  I purchased a 2.0 engine from a 76 to put in the bus.  Later on I
was able to purchase the 76 bus the engine came from to use for parts for
the conversion, brackets, fuel pump, tank, etc.  I'd like to sell the 73
with the engine and I'll include the 76 bus for the parts.  None of the
parts necessary for the fuel injection conversion have been removed from the
76 yet.  The engine includes tin, all accessories, air cleaner, computer,
etc.

I also have a Jeep CJ5 that I'll most likely be selling if anyone is
interested in it.

Email me directly if you are interested in pictures or more information
about either bus.

The busses are located in Hesperia California.


John
