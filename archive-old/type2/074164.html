Subject: Re: [T2] Fri--What is it with the dead? 


Grant,

As someone who is burning a few dead shows for friends as we speak,
and, as someone who is attempting to explain the phenomenon 
(of the Dead) to some friends from overseas (in writing), I'll attempt 
a brief answer.

First, a good FAQ can be found here:

http://www-2.cs.cmu_dot_edu/~mleone/gdead/faq/faq.html

And they delve with the name &quot;Grateful Dead&quot; here:

http://www-2.cs.cmu_dot_edu/~mleone/gdead/faq/name.html

which was conceived quite innocently, but also has a 
literary reference.

Their connection to busses (AFAICT) is as follows:

Over thirty years, the Dead toured constantly, performing live
over 2500 times.  People (Deadheads) would go &quot;on tour&quot;
and follow the dead for weeks, months, and even years, living
in their cars, camping, and generally living day to day.  Given
that VW Busses have always been relatively cheap (compared to a 
new mini-van) and comfortable (to live in), there always
seemed to be a lot of busses on tour.  Somewhere in there,
VW Busses got associated with hippies and deadheads, probably
because along the way (over the 30 years) a lot of people
had a lot of experiences in VW busses and thought of them
as the ideal machine to tour in.  This probably resulted in
people who were about to go on tour thinking &quot;Wow, I need a BUS
before I even think about undertaking this!&quot;

That's it, as far as I can figure it.

What does this mean?  It means that some people associate busses
with hippies.  Dirty, smelly, hippies.  People looking for handouts,
people not working, people who are loafing.  Maybe, just maybe, they
associate them with the hoards that would descend upon their town/business/etc.
whenever the dead roll into town.

On the other hand, it also means that a lot of people have travelled around
in a bus, have a lot of fond bus memories, and maybe, just maybe, wish
they could own one sometime in their lives.

Hope this helps.
