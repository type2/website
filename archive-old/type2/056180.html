Hello All:

I am trying to contact Volks Motorsports, but can't seem to 
find there URL.

Also, anyone know what happened to Will Wood and his 
KdF Service and Supply ??

I am trying to find a source to rebuild my calipers on for
my '79 bus.  Haven't had any luck with the local shops.

Anyone know of a place that can rebuild mine or someone
that sales rebuilt calipers at a reasonable price ???

thanks for your assistance!
