Hi,
	While Kristin's death is shocking, it's worth keeping 
perspective. The odds were in her favour (few people are 
murdered, even in the US). She was, perhaps, more vulnerable
than some but it was her choice to travel as she did and
there was no reason for her to anticipate that she would
run into any serious difficulties. It's very hard for
people to assess risk accurately in situations where the
risk is very low and it's common for isolated incidents
like this to get blown out of proportion.

 We should do what we can to help catch the perpetrator 
of this crime but to suggest that what Kristin was doing
was dangerous or that it should force a change in behavior
is probably off the mark.

 She was more at risk while on the highway than she was
at the rest stop. A moments inattention from a truck 
driver was more likely to kill her on this trip than
a murderer.

 I'm sorry if this seems stark, but the British tabloid
press is very gung ho on this sort of stuff and it 
really gets to me!

 I guess what I'm really saying is that travelling isn't
dangerous, per se. You can be shot while sitting at home
almost as easily as while out on a road trip so don't
let people tell you that bussing is risky. They know
not of what they speak.

Cheers,
	 W.
