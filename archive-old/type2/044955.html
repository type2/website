Subject: Re: [T2] Which engine should I use for my 73 Westy?  Found a 2
  L I think?

The brain is different, but I believe the other parts will be the same.
Many people choose the 1.8 over the 2.0 because of head and valve features
that tend to make it run a little cooler. The valves are bigger on the 1.8.

You'd want the brain from the 1.8 on the 1.8 anyway; if you upgrade to a
2.0, you'll want the brain from that. I havn't been following your thread,
so I don't know if you're just planning to rebuild this to 2.0 when you get
it. If you are, holler at me. I'm currently running a 1.8 on a 2.0 brain
and we might be able to work out a swap.

If I were in your shoes, though, I'd probably opt for the 1.8 since it
runs. I have a 2.0 as well as a 1.8 and although I *can* tell a difference
in the amount of power between the two, it's of little consequence. Either
engine is quite adequate for my '72 Riviera. The only time I'd rather have
the power of the 2.0 is when I want to accelerate on a fairly steep
incline. I can hold my own with a 1.8, but I can build speed with a 2.0.
Top end on either engine is at least 85 or 90 and that's too fast in a
Riviera, IMHO.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;Looks like I may have answered my own question here from looking at the
&gt;type2 library.  According to that if it's a 75 engine it's a 1.8L.   If it
&gt;is a 1.8 does that engine use the same injectors, manifold, harness and
&gt;brain as the 2.0?  I'd like to end up with a 2.0 so it might be worth
&gt;picking this engine up to get all the other parts I need if they will
&gt;interchange.  I'll check the case codes to try and get a better idea of what
&gt;the engine is when I see it.

&gt;&gt; Thanks to everyone that replied to my questions about an engine for my 73
&gt;&gt; Westy.  I still haven't been able to catch the person at home that's
&gt;selling
&gt;&gt; this type 4 engine but I did find out more info on it and will get to see
&gt;it
&gt;&gt; tomorrow.  The engine is complete, pulled out of a 75 bus. It has all the
&gt;FI
&gt;&gt; parts, brain, harness, etc, also complete with all tin and exhaust so it
&gt;&gt; should be just what I need for my bus since I don't have any of those
&gt;parts.
&gt;&gt; The person selling it said he drove the bus and has the engine on the
&gt;ground
&gt;&gt; now but I can see it run.  If it's the original engine from a 75 then it
&gt;&gt; should be a 2 liter shouldn't it?   Also will the 75 engine mate up with
&gt;my
&gt;&gt; 73 tranny/bell housing?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; John
