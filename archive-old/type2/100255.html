&gt;Old Penske.
&gt;it doesn't have an inductive clamp. Instead it has an
&gt;alligator clip that you are supposed to attach to a
&gt;sparkplug &quot;extender&quot; (a springing thing, from looking
&gt;at the manual). The extenders are, of course, missing

I connect my old style T/L (not Penske) to the distributor end of #1. One 
high voltage cable connects to the distributor #1 hole, the other high 
voltage cable to the dangling #1 plug wire.

&gt;is there a simple away to make this work on my bus?
&gt;can i buy an inductive pickup and attach it?
&gt;can I make a sparkplug extender?
&gt;Any guidance appreciated.

I don't know how since mine runs off high voltage (no 12 volts).
