Subject: RE: [T2] Need outdoor cover for camper

&gt;&gt; I need a reasonably priced (around $100.00, more or less) 
&gt;&gt; outdoor cover.  I'm not picky about perfect custom fit 


&gt; I doubt that you will find a *quality* one big enough for a 
&gt; bus at that price.


Actually you will.  We have a new offering from Just Kampers in England
that at $129 would probably qualify as &quot;$100 more or less,&quot; and it has a
unique feature not found on any other cover. As well as being custom fit
for a Bus or Vanagon (with or without poptop), it has zippered access to
the front and side doors, so you can get in without removing it. This is
a great idea, as you can load/unload your bus, start it periodically in
the winter, or just air it out.  There is a flap over the zipper so it
won't scratch your paint.
