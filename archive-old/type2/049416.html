Subject: [T2] Windshield Sealant

the stuff to use to seal up the windshield of your T2, once youve got the
rubber in place,
is 3M Windo-Weld, Part  #08633.  Its NOT the ribbon stuff, also called
Windo-Weld.

Its a butyl product special formulated for old rubber gasked type windows,
like ours.  It can also be used to fixed leaky old rubber without replacing
the rubber, apparently (for those on the list with beaters!)

The stuff is listed here:  http://www.7net7_dot_com/glasnet/sealers.htm

and there is also a little picture of the stuff.

Thanks everyone.
