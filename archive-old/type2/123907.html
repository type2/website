Subject: Undercoating?

&gt; I'm thinking a few coats of primer then the bedliner stuff would be the 
&gt; best bet out of them all.

I don't know about the duplicolor brand. I've heard other recommend Rhino as 
tougher, but I've never seen a source for it. Also, you may want to watch. 
After I primed and followed with liner, I found the liner was an antirust 
formulation that was supposed to be applied directly to the metal, so I'm 
thinking my protection is not as good as it could have been because I think 
the liner would adhere better than primer.
