&gt;
&gt;heres the deal. i have a regular 74 bus with a westy interior (a weekender)
&gt;and i want the poptop now :) so many questions! ok, first off, should i only
&gt;be looking for a 74 fiberglas poptop? or will other 70's year fit? whic
&gt;hyears had the luggage rack in the front and which had them in the back?
&gt;which years did the sleeping area pop towards the back and which popped
&gt;towards the front? i was at my local VW junkyard today (in south el monte,
&gt;CA) and they had 3 westy poptops. i looked at them...i made mental notes of
&gt;what to do to convert mine into a westy. the roof is exactly the same as my
&gt;roof except the westies have braces welded underneath. so it appears. it
&gt;doesnt look like i need to do some job like cutting the whole roof off, and
&gt;transplanting roofs. alot of it seems to be about the bracing. so if i get
&gt;myself a junked bus i should be able to transplant the braces fine. another
&gt;question. did all westies (70's years) have a sliding roof panel to cover up
&gt;the hole? unfortunately i didnt make a deal on any of the three westies i
&gt;saw becuase the busses all had cars stacked on top crunchinh the nice
&gt;fibreglass top (DUH!) and another question... (sorry) westies all had cots
&gt;for sleeping up above? looking at the photos of my bentley service manual
&gt;'68-'79 (page 40, chapter 1, body and frame) it doesnt appear more than one
&gt;normal size adult can sleep up there. am i wrong? heck i'm only 5'10, 150lbs
&gt;and it looks more cramped than my cramped 2 person R.E.I. tent!
&gt;
&gt;does anyone sell the rubber weatherstrip that goes inside around the
&gt;louvered jalousie windows? i cant find it anywhere.
&gt;
&gt;lastly, let me thank anyone who responds to any of the questions!
&gt;
&gt;best regards, dave
