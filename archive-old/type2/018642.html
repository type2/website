This is a one-owner Westy that I am selling for my neighbor, who has replaced
it with a 97 EV Winebago.
 
55K actual  miles, engine rebuilt at 50K, 4 speed transmission.
Body is very good, white, with minor seam rust and a small ding behind sliding door.
All camping equipment works fine.  Dometic refrigerator still has ice cube
trays and wire shelves in their original plastic wrap, but started on
the first try with propane power.
Canvas is like new.  Interior is clean, with wear evident only on driver's seat.
Factory gas heater works well as a supplement to standard heater boxes.
This is a clean, good running Westy.  It is located in Minneapolis.  Delivery
to distant locations is negotiable.  Asking price is $ 5,000.
 
You can contact me by e-mail at bpremack_at_wavetech_dot_net or by phone (at any
reasonable hour) at (612) 927-5303.
