Subject: RE: [T2] Best Body Panels?

&gt; Okay, I found the right person to do the bodywork on my rusty 
&gt; 1969 bus. Who makes the best fitting replacement parts?


By far the largest producer of bus body panels is Klokkerholm of
Denmark. In addition some panels are still available from Volkswagen
themselves.  Then there are A.H. Schofield and Just Kampers in the UK.
Finally there are several aftermarket Brazilian suppliers (most of which
are not comparable to any of the above).  Sometimes the name on the
panel is not the name of the actual producer. For example, some of
Klokkerholm's body panels are actually relabeled Brazilian pieces, and
some of Schofield's pieces are actually relabeled Klokkerholm pieces. So
you kind of have to know what you're buying. 

We pick and choose suppliers literally on a part by part basis, to
provide the best possible fit and quality available on that particular
part. We ship Genuine VW when possible, since this is the best quality.
The rest is a combination of the other European suppliers mentioned
above, all of which have a proven track record of proper fit and finish.
We have to import much of it ourselves, as about the only thing
available directly in the U.S. is Klokkerholm or Brazilian. The only
Brazilian part that we ship for a '68-up that I can think of offhand is
the complete front nose, but it is a good quality part and we've been
selling it for years. (Klokkerholm also sells one, but they're simply
relabeling the same Brazilian nose. Some suppliers erroneously list it
as being Danish or even German made, but the truth is you simply paid
more to send your new Brazilian nose from South to North America by way
of Denmark; not exactly the most direct route.) 

It used to be that virtually every VW parts retailers besides us shipped
only Klokkerholm, as that is the most available brand in the U.S. Which
is not really all that bad, as Klokkerholm's quality is generally
decent. However, Klokkerholm had some huge price increases over the last
few months, and as a result some other retailers have been switching to
off-brand Brazilian suppliers in order to keep costs down. (For example,
a listmember recently reported getting one Brazilian and one Danish
wheel well from California Import Parts.) This is a switch that I am
reluctant to make, as most of the Brazilian brands have no track record
in terms of fit or longevity. For now, I'm just grinning and bearing it,
paying the extra money for the Klokkerholm stuff, and trying to absorb
as much of the price increase as I can, rather than switching to an
as-yet-unproven product. I'll bide my time and let my competitors'
customers be the guinea pigs, rather than my customers. :-)

So if you buy from us, you will probably get a fair amount of Danish
Klokkerholm with some genuine VW and British Schofield mixed in - all
good stuff. If you buy elsewhere, you may get either all Klokkerholm, or
some combination of Klokkerholm and aftermarket Brazilian.
