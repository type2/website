&gt; here in Pullman washington, I need to get a tuneup for my 70 westy bus.  I
&gt; called several places: $140-180 at one, a bit less at another, and at a
&gt; regular mechanic all-around-shop, over $300.  These prices are for valve
&gt; adjustment, tuneup, adjust card, replace pts, plugs, etc.  My question...
&gt; are these prices reasonable or outlandish?
&gt; I could stomache the $140 or so price, but at $300, I'd be willing to learn
&gt; real fast how to adjust the valves.  I can do a tuneup, but have difficulty
&gt; getting things running smoothly, and know little about carbeaution matters.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Also, what could I expect for a sales price for this camper in fair-good
&gt; condition with sink ( no working faucet and no ice box), pop up and
&gt; sleeping hammocks, and good rear cushion.

Gee, I'm in the wrong business. With a little practice, That's about
$200/ hour. (1.25X $200=$250 + $50 for parts=$300) Better than plumbers!
