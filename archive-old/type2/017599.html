Just a thank you to all that respond to my Q's about the &quot;non air cooled
non type 2 mobile. greatly apperciated.

Aonther thing, I'm planning on buying a buss that runs in the near
future. Which means I will be selling and or trading my bus, 1980
Vanagon. I'm also relocting in month. This is going to go cheep cheep so
p-mail me if you want the stats.

Another thanx though  belated, to all for help on this bus.
The type 2 list rocks!!!!
