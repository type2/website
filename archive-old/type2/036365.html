Subject: Re: Felt ring/needle bearing

any luck on the *felt ring*?  i am wondering where it goes.  i have not seen
one.  as to the pilot bearing i have cut the race ever so gently and
collapsed it just as you have mentioned.  on the type iv it was in the
crank, the type i/ii it was in the gland nut that bolted down the flywheel. 
i am not aware of one being in both the crank AND the flywheel on the type
iv since the type iv does not use the big gland nut, but rather the 5 bolt
system.

&gt;  List,

&gt;  Might someone know if the little felt ring that goes in the end of the
type4
&gt;  flywheel is available?
&gt;  
&gt;  It seems to be like 'hen's teeth' locally...
&gt;  
&gt;  Also, the Bentley seems to suggest that there ought to be a needle
bearing in
&gt;  the flywheel. There is one in the crank, but not in the flywheel.  Should
&gt;  there be?
&gt;  
&gt;  Is there an easier way to pull the bearing from the crank than cutting
the
&gt;  race and collapsing it?
&gt;  
&gt;  TIA,
