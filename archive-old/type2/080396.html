Subject: Re: [T2] snow stories

(Bruce Maxson should relate)
We used to live up in Syracuse NY where the snow measured as inches per
month exceeds a lot of colder places because of the Lake Effect snow
from the Great lakes- Our 71 bus got us everywhere; we were often the
only ones out camping in winter between there and Rochester and Niagara
Falls.  I remember a run we made to NJ one weekend during a really bad
storm, having to go down a local road (Rt 17) when they closed
Interstate  81- averaged 35 mph, but with chains, chugged along with 15&quot;
on the road surface!  Gottaq get that Ebersbacher out the the ol' 71 in
the woods.......

&gt; &gt; speaking of snow and busses. i know there has got to
&gt; &gt; be some crazy stories out there regarding people
&gt; &gt; driving their busses in the snow. so, let's hear 'em!!
&gt; 
&gt; back when I was younger and much more foolish I once bet someone I could
&gt; do a 4 wheel drift through a turn in my 60  23window deluxe....later I
&gt; learned some things about swing axles that turned my hair white...but I
&gt; did win a steak dinner and as a poor college student that was the best
&gt; meal I had in months.
&gt; 
&gt; I also used to take that thing out in the snowstorms just to play in the
&gt; snow.. (I was big time crazy) just sliding it around parking lots and
&gt; driving past all the folks stuck on the side of the road....don't know why
&gt; but I never remember being very cold....??  it was my 71 that I always
&gt; remember as the &quot;Cold&quot; bus
&gt; 
&gt; ??? Bob
&gt; got my ski waxed up waiting for the snow to come, or at least cold enough
&gt; to turn on the snow guns!!!
