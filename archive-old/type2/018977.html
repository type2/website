Well....in a few days I will be the proud owner of a 1963 kombi.  It is
stripped right now...to the metal and primed...the top half of the
doors...glass...are even off.  all the glass is out, but the trans and
wheels and brakes and steering etc is still intact.  I just have to
rewire the whole bit, paint it, and wire it.  Should be fun!  The only
body flaws are a slight dimple in the rear drivers side belt line...waay
in back...jsut a little...and a dent in the nose which is easily
fixable.
It comes with...
full length roof rack AND ladder!! in perfect shape!!
extra rear seat
extra trans
2 motors
extra glass
extra cargo door
   &quot;     side doors
&quot; front doors
&quot; bumpers
&quot; front beam
&quot; body sheet metal
manuals up the wazoo, a big bin of VW trends, and WORKING gas heaters,
carbs, intake manifolds, rims, tires, brake stuff, and 4 or so other BIG
tupperware bins of stuff we haven't even looked at yet...gems...tons of
stuff
All I need are the 2 front windshields and seals and its complete...that
and all the nuts/bolts etc for the windows and stuff like that
She is beautiful...perfect roof and the rest of the body is dent free
and for...get this!  $850!!!
I'm trading him my old motorcycle so it will be the bike plus about 500
bucks...
and I can make payments if I don't have all the cash...which I
wont'...I'll prolly be selling some stuff from the deal to pay for it
such as the extra rear seat...it even comes with a nice middle seat! and
an extra front bench and extra steering wheel..
tons of stuff I don't even know what it all is...its all of this guys VW
stuff...
I'm sooooooooo happy!!
I get it in my garage as soon as the 69 is gone which will be in 2
weeks...it will be in my garage the same day we move the 69 as we are
using the same trailer etc...
So in about 2 weeks I'll have a work of art in my garage..
ahh...the hunt is over..
and a perfect full length roof rack and ladder!! did I say that? yes!
Just gotta brag a little :)
and I've seen it...and its NOT a bug! :) like that other &quot;bus&quot; was...

hey jack...still have those 6V starters? maybe I can work out a deal
with that guy that has the &quot;fully restored&quot; automatic 23 window deluxe!
hehehe :)

This is just my first leap into the VW world...
I'm sure many questions will arise...please bare with me...mainly things
about wiring...but thats what all the manuals are for....I'll keep the
posts to a minimum (just for you admins ;)

well..adios for now!
