&quot; Just HOW do you go about getting that top piece down (which i was both
suprised and impressed to find out it was actually wood) I guess, because
it seems to be attatched to the piecest that run above the back windows.&quot;

Trick is to pull down the center (stick your arm in there), which will
reduce the effective span side to side- then push upwards with the other
hand along one of the tracks and slip it out of that track.  The rest is
easy....... MB .
