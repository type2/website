Now, Karl, as an owner of two Jaguars, I can't let you
get away with defending Lucas.  They may make good
brake boosters, but that's an anomaly.  They can't
make connectors, switches, or even relays that are
even remotely reliable.  Certainly wouldn't take one
of my cars on a long trip.  Most mechanics won't touch
them.  But they look great and ride smooth.  Nice to
putter around in on the weekends.  Cheers...KR

&gt; Lucas electric systems more likely to leak smoke

&gt;  I have not
&gt; had to replace any Lucas brake part.

&gt; and not all the brake parts suppliers match!]
