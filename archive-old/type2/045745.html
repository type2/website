Subject: [T2] Installing Cigarette lighter.
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi folks,

I am up in Canada and ventured to Canadian tire and picked up an auxiliary power
outlet that you attach to the dash (a cigarette lighter).  My bus does not have
a cigarette lighter, so I am not sure what I connect this new thing to.  I am a
bit of an idiot when it comes to wiring, can anyone give me some guidance.

Paul
