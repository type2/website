&gt;Do you think it's toast? Or should I have to run the
&gt;bus much longer to get the battery charged up from
&gt;zero.

	You can't expect the alternator to suffice  -  your 
experience already indicates that as a broad hint.
	There is a small chance that charging the battery for a week 
will bring a new lease of life.  But don't then rely on it to take 
you far out / back o' Bourke / into any distant Neighbourhood.
	What I do in such circumstances is to charge for a week and 
then run a headlight bulb hooked onto it, measuring the time to run 
out.  If it's say a 50W bulb, that drains c. 4 amp from your 12V 
battery.  When the battery was in top order, it would deliver c.50 
amp-h i.e run this bulb about 12 h.  If the bulb fades after only 
minutes you may as well admit defeat - you've proved it's incapable 
of holding sufficient charge, and your alternator will certainly not 
cope; please do make sure the battery is traded in to a recycling 
factory, as its components are largely recyclable (and toxic).
