Subject: Re: [T2] Weird signal light behavior?

I had exactly the same problem.  I had to re-do the
connector on the light and checked and cleaned all of
the ground connectors.  It hasn't done it since.  The
connector on the light was barely holding the hot wire
on.  I removed it and re-soldered the post.  Works
like a charm now.  Cheers...KR

&gt; My signal lights work normally when I am driving and

&gt; put the brake lights on. If I do, the signal light
&gt; speeds up. I find that
&gt; weird, since you would think the increased
&gt; electrical load of the brake
&gt; lights coming on would make them slow down, not
&gt; speed up. Any thoughts on
&gt; this? I'm thinking they get a better ground when the
&gt; taillight circuit is
&gt; brought into play, so speed up? Just a guess on my
&gt; part.
