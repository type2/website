Subject: bus safety

I thought this new study from Virginia DMV and VCU pertinent to the recent 
discussion of bus safety in which we mostly concluded how we drive was more 
important:

&quot;We've known for years that drivers contribute more to causing crashes than 
the vehicle or the roadway,&quot; Robert J. Breitenbach, director of VCU's 
Transportation Safety Training Center, said in a news release announcing the 
study. &quot;In many instances the driver error involves not paying attention to 
the driving task. We can now identify those distractions with some 
confidence.&quot;

The top 15 driving distractions are:

  1.. Rubbernecking (looking at a crash, vehicle, roadside incident, or 
traffic): 16 percent
  2.. Driver fatigue: 12 percent
  3.. Looking at scenery or landmarks: 10 percent
  4.. Passenger or child distraction: 9 percent
  5.. Adjusting radio or changing CD or tape: 7 percent
  6.. Cell phone: 5 percent
  7.. Eyes not on the road: 4.5 percent
  8.. Not paying attention, daydreaming: 4 percent
  9.. Eating or drinking: 4 percent
  10.. Adjusting vehicle controls: 4 percent
  11.. Weather conditions: 2 percent
  12.. Unknown: 2 percent
  13.. Insect, animal, or object entering or striking vehicle: 2 percent
  14.. Document, book, map, directions, or newspaper: 2 percent
  15.. Medical or emotional impairment: 2 percent
Fascinating facts:

  a.. Fully 62 percent of the crashes involving driver distraction occurred 
in rural areas.
  b.. Top distractions in rural areas were driver fatigue, insects, animals, 
and unrestrained pets.
  c.. Top distractions in urban areas were rubbernecking, traffic, other 
vehicles, and cell phones.
Pay attention out there!&quot;
