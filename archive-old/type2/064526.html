Subject: Re: phosphoric acid

The idea behind the use of phosphoric acid is to convert rust (iron oxide) to a 
more stable product,  iron phosphate (s?). It forms a black surface that seals 
the metal and excludes the oxygen in the air, preventing more rust. 

The finish is awfull;&gt;( It must be filled and sealed with a good paint job.

Point of note; this method is used to treat electric transformer cases. How many 
have you noted rusted out lately?
