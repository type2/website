Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS rescue---Engine runs fine, but dies when the
  engine is under load.

Hi Mike,

Kudos for lending a hand to someone in need. A lot of people are  
thankful for your willingness to lend a hand; it's something that  
makes the bus community special.

As for your mechanic's comment: there are no &quot;test machines&quot; required  
to troubleshoot L-Jet Fuel injection. All you need is the following  
common and inexpensive tools:

- 12V test light.  ($1)
- Ohm meter  ($20 multimeter)
- Volt meter (same multimeter as above)
- dwell guage/tach ($20)
- timing light ($30)
- Vacuum Gauge ($30)
- Fuel pressure gauge ($40)

...And the knowledge of how and when to use them. That part comes  
partly from experience and from the manuals: bentley and the Bosch  
factory manuals that are available online.

Did anyone verify fuel pressure when the engine bogs down on a hill??  
If the problem only happens on a hill or under load it will be  
difficult to resolve in a shop.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
