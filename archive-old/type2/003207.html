X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

To the Group;
I am trying to locate the plastic or other material used as seat guides for
the front bucket seats in my bus.  This material is used on both rails on
both seats.  This material not only helps make the seat slide easier, but
stabilizes the seat. I went to my local VW dealer and they are pictured in
the part book, but no part number and are not longer available.

Thanks,

Bill Kratch
