Subject: Wanted: Rear vent side window

Greetings,

I am looking for a side rear vent/wing window in good condition for my '78 
restoration project. this is the rectangular shaped window above the 
cooler/fridge unit in the later bays. The one in the rearmost drivers side 
window. I've noticed some of the frames of these windows are chrome and 
others are just painted black. I like the chrome ones as they don't seem to 
be as rusty but would take any that is free of rust and in good working 
order.

Thanks,
Brandt in Utah
