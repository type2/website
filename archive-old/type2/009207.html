Hey Tripps?
am i confooosed? Are you saying that the vacuum power brake assist booster 
can have an electrical connection short out in the rain and then you loose 
your brakes?
I don't understand how the Brake warning  light saved you? :-)
am i missing something?
Thanks
Jamie

&gt;A while ago the Brake warning light saved me when after going through to 
&gt;many
&gt;puddles, they shorted out the eletrical connection for my brake booster, I
&gt;still had brakes, just not power assisted, unfortunately I noticed the 
&gt;light
&gt;AFTER i ran a red light since I wasn't prepared for non-powered brakes all 
&gt;of
&gt;a sudden.
