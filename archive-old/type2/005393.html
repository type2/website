Rob,
    My 78 rear bench has the same holes that the front bucket seats have,
except that they have a litle plastic plug that you have to pry out.  Then
slide some headrests into place and cruise with a clear conscience......
Plus it looks sooo cooool toooo.

Same subject, different question.   Does anyone know whether or not the
middle 2/3 bench on the Champaigne Edition Transporters had these plugged
holes??  The PO had the upulstery redone on this seat, and it has no plugs.
Just curious if I could add these safely when I change interior colors....

Word,
Isaiah Smith
