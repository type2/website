Subject: Re: [T2] Grounding the Engine.

As a source of cables, don't overlook the guys who rebuild alternators and/or 
starters.  At least they can give you info on where to buy good cables.  In 
Easton, Maryland, there is Pasco.... part of their business is agricultural, so 
they make up cables for a very reasonable price.  Lots of the old-car restorers 
use them, because they stock the very heavy conductors that are essential for 6-
volt systems.  You should have similar guys in your area.

It won't hurt to replace the grounding straps, especially if you see any 
evidence of corrosion.  Avoid cabling from K.Mart and other places, where the 
conductor has less than OE copper content.
