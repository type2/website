Subject: Re: Help please

 yes it's another starter question. We're talking about a 1965 bus with a 1967
&gt; engine in it. Don't ask me why, I just got her and I'm the second owner. She
&gt; starts sometimes, sometimes not. Here's the symptoms:
&gt;     I can start her by jumping across the solenoid with a large screwdriver.
&gt;     I can also compression start it, and it starts using jumper cables.
&gt;     The starter is new, the solenoid is new, the battery is new, the spark
plugs
&gt; are new, the points, rotor, cap, condenser, and distributor are all new.
&gt;     The coil is old and the ignition switch is old.
&gt;     When I turn the key it goes &quot;click&quot; and then nothing.
&gt;     There is a flat spot in the ignition switch (if it feels like starting,
you
&gt; can turn the key too far and it won't.)
&gt;     I think the coil is maybe 6 years old, 3 of which were spent while the
bus
&gt; sat under a tree, not moving the whole time.
&gt;
The PO of my '67 had taken apart the ignition switch to fiddle with the
tumblers. He then taped it together, and with time, the tape wore loose, and
produced the symptoms you described; basically from loose and weak contacts. I
put the switch back together tightly, an it works fine now. Those switches are
sealed units, but sometimes the crimps wear loose, and contact is not perfect
within the switch...If that's the case, you can tighten it and re-crimp it.
