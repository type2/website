From: Russell Barr &lt;guzziot_at_localaccess_dot_com&gt;asks:


&gt;&gt;   I'm trying to install a stereo into my roommate's '71 bus.  I have
&gt;&gt; pounded, ground, and otherwise jammed the stereo into the dash, but I am
&gt;&gt; having problems with the wiring.  Could someone tell me what I should
&gt;&gt; connect the &quot;Constant power&quot; and &quot;Ignition/power&quot; wires to?
Use a voltmeter or a test light to find power that's on when the ignition is
on and another spot where there's power all the time.  I use the fuse box
ans the rear defogger switch.  I also make up for the lack of an acc.
position by installing a toggle  switch on the front panel to switch on the
radio power with ignition on when I want it.
