****Karl, Jason, Eddie....

Actually, the small black harness you see behind the battery goes to the side marker light.  Jasons, Eddie's, (mine too) harness in question does not.  Good guess though Karl.
I had the same questions on the wires in mine.  Not easily detected on the wiring diagram.  3 Wires.  Brown, brown/white, and yellow/red.  All 3 wires end at the Test Network Plug.  Grab your wiring diagram now and look.  They are orange terminal spots #'s 7, 8, and 17.  Brown goees directly to battery negative,  Brown/white goes to where the battery ground strap connects to body, and the other shows it going to the &quot;middle&quot; of the battery.  I have no idea what this &quot;middle&quot; of the battery is.  Maybe Karl knows??
hope this helps guys...let me know..
