Subject: RE: [T2] Why can't people fix things right?

&gt; &gt; It is too
&gt; &gt; painful to see some of the mutilation to the vehicles!
&gt;
&gt;My wife gets a good laugh at me whenever they destroy a perfectly
&gt;good/restorable type I on Junkyard Wars, because it puts me
&gt;in a foul mood.

I get the same way. When I saw the street racing scene in Delta Force, when 
Chuck Norris and his friend are fleeing from some terrorists in a white 
loaf, and they put a nasty series of bullet holes through the poor thing, I 
started yelling at the screen. This entertained my roommates far more than 
the decidedly mediocre movie itself did.

I mean, it hurts when they ruin a perfectly nice bus for a good movie. It's 
just torture when they do it for a bad movie.
