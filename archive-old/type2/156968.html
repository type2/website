Subject: Re: [T2] No idle/hard restart at operating temp - the saga 
  continues... UPDATE

&gt; Fixed! I replaced the temp sensor and the fuel

&gt; it runs like a top! I drove it around for quite
&gt; awhile (air temp was
&gt; still 95: at 9pm) and had none of the previous
&gt; stalling or hard
&gt; restart issues. Thanks for the advice, and it's
&gt; always nice to fix the
&gt; problem the first time around.

EXCELLENT! Glad to hear my instincts were wrong! That
it acted as it did with that sensor unplugged is a new
one on me - unless the filter was mostly blocked.
Thanks for the update. -BaH
