Subject: Re: Strippe CV Joint hex nut

&lt;grin&gt; I hate it when this happens (the other reason I carry the half dozen 
replacements!)

I had a pair of needle nose vice grips.  Clamped it on the head as tight as I 
could get it.  Doused it with Silikroil (it's like liquis plumber, but we get 
it at work...), let it soak, and doused it again.  Then I took a small 
hammer, and while I applied pressure to the vice grips, tapped on the end of 
the bolt.  After a lot of time (and 2 broken nails) it came loose... but then 
it took a pair of big pliers (and another nail) to get the grips off the bolt 
(they were that tight on the bolt).

Good luch, hon!
