im watching my gas gauge go down very fast while im driving around. i just put
the motor back in and it runs good. hard to start when cold. wont idle. but
runs great when hot. i think my timing is very close (i have  a worn woodruff
key in crankshaft (glued on tight) so i could be a tad off, but not much.
intake manifolds are cool to the the touch with warm engine. is this carb
dumping in too much gas and if so why is it running sooo good?
thanks, marty :)  (driving from fl to jerome on sunday sep 6th)
