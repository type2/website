Subject: [T2] Re: Jerome Pilgrage &amp; UJJA

Regarding the UJJA.  I just measured the trophy--It is 30&quot; tall--The ABC is in
no way responsible for this award as it comes out of my pocket. This is not the
only VW Event where it is given out--The criteria to &quot;Win&quot; this award is in my
head. There has already been times when i have asked other people to help me
narrow it down, but the burden and BS that comes with it, is mine, and mine
alone. It was Never meant as serious award--But in good fun. The 30&quot; trophy this
year, is in lieu of the 10th anniversary of Jerome Jamboree. The VW Hobby
should be fun and enjoyable for all--and that is the sole purpose of the UJJA.
The ABC should be recognized for their unselfish amount of cold, hard, cash
given to The Foundation for Burns and Trauma, as well as many other Charities
