Subject: Re: Opinions sought - Cooper and Avon tires

For about 3 years I have been running the Discoverer LT 195/75R 14 load range
C.  They seem to be on the tall skinny side, but I don't have anything to
compare to.  The side of the tire says Max. load is 1435 lbs at 50 psi.  They
seem to have a pretty aggressive tread design and there is also an M/S on the
side of the tire. Mud and Snow I thought.  Is this really a good tire for our
busses?  I was really sold on these tires until I read on the list that we
need at least a 1500 lb rating per tire.  Anyway, they were a huge
improvement over the passenger car tires that they replaced.  My bus still
drives like a sail boat on a windy day, but there is no evidence on the tires
that they are rolling side to side.  Maybe It's time for new front and rear
stabilizer bars?  Cooper makes the same tire for Les Schwabb - called the
Wildcat.  I have no idea about their mud and snow capabilities.  As soon as I
bought them, I stopped driving in the mud and snow.

&gt; I am doing a search of tire properties and have come across Avon/Cooper
&gt; (same company, different names in Europe and US).  They manufature the
&gt; following tires that will fit our vans:
&gt;
&gt; Man     Avon    Avon    Avon            Cooper          Cooper
&gt;
&gt; Name    AV4     AV4     Turbogrip CR 25 Discoverer LT   SRM II Radial
&gt;
&gt; size    185R14  195R14  185R14          195R14          195R14
&gt;
&gt; L. R.   C       C       C               C               D (2095 LB!)
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any experience with any of these tires?  I called Cooper and
&gt; the gentleman there recommenced the Discoverer and Turbogrip as being
&gt; better for traction (none are M+S rated) and the AV4 and SRM II as better
&gt; highway tires.
