Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 Shift Rod R&amp;Rquestion

Chris/Scott,

Guys, maybe this is the time to improve on the bushings...you saw my 
comment on them, and after I got them in, they seems to do ok, but 
shifting seemed somehow &quot;rougher&quot;.._dot_cause i couldn't figure out how to 
keep grease on them all the way back up thru the tube!

Chris, what we need are roller bearings on these things instead of just
a plastic surface on the inside of the tube.  I have threatened to 
drill holes in my tube right where the bushings are and then pump grease 
into the tube with my grease gun...then seal the small holes back up.

Unfortunately, I am still waiting for someone to replace them and actually
measure where they are in the tube!(or on the rod)....hint,hint&lt;grin&gt;

I don't think you are going to be able to &quot;turn&quot; anything satisfactorily.

Cheers,dave

&gt; &gt;the replacement rear bushings are pathetic quality, impossible to install
&gt; &gt;without doing quite a bit of work to them. they are very poorly molded and
&gt; &gt;don't fit on the rod. the front bushing i would buy from the dealer, the
&gt; &gt;rubber quality is completely different between the dealer ones and the
&gt; &gt;aftermarket.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody ever turn any of these from store bought PVC pipe? Anything close 
&gt; in diameter?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I can live with the shifter noise and poor shift quality... &lt;grin&gt;
