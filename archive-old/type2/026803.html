Hola!
   I know that there are many posts in the archives about pop-top canvas, 
but none really satisfied my search.  I need a new canvas for my 76' Westy 
in the next couple of weeks.  There seems to be mixed feelings out there 
about PLF's tops...great material and quality, but takes forever to get 
them, and I don't have forever.  On their website it says that they are not 
currently accepting orders due to a backlog, but will continue again 
sometime near December.  I would love to send my business that way, but as I 
said, would like it in a couple of weeks.  Are there any other places out 
there that make their tops w/ &quot;Sunbrella?&quot;  What I guess I'm asking is what 
are the best tops out there and where can they be had?  I will be using mine 
quite frequently.  Muchos gracias amigos!
                                           -Mike
