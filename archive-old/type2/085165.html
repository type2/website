Subject: 76 - 79 car cover on a 71

HIYA!

This is not necessarily a rant:

My wife ordered a car cover for me on December 14 for Christmas.  When it did 
not arrive a month later I called and apparently they didn't follow through 
with the order (Christmas rush perhaps) so they went ahead and made good on 
it, throwing in shipping for free (it's a custom made thing involving 
drop-shipment from the manufacturer, I guess).  Anyhoo, I finally got it 
yesterday and put it on my bus.  It fits fine, except for the antenna and the 
front mounted spare tire.  I looked on the order sheet and it said VOLKSWAGEN 
BUS 76-79 CAMPER.

Not necessarily a rant mode off:

I am not aware of any MAJOR differences in the body size for bays from 1969 
to 1979.  If I send this one back, and get another one specific for my model 
year, will I notice any difference?  Is it worth the shipping and the wait?
