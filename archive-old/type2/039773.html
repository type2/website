Subject: Re: Tool question

Well... I have Snap-on tools and I have Craftsman tools and I have Harbour
Freight tools.  For the money, the Harbour Freight tools do the job just fine.
 Pittsburg Professional.  Cheap.  Decent feel.  A set of end wrenches from 8mm
to 19mm and 1/4&quot; to 3/4&quot; costs $19.95.  A couple of my Snap-on wrenchs cost
the same (or more!)  Sockets?  You will eventually need deep sockets.
