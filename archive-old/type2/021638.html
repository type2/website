Any idea as to how to separate the case from the tranny?.

&gt; Sounds like a throwout bearing or a broken clutch mounting bolt. If you
&gt; could just separate the case from the tranny about 1/2&quot; you could see if
&gt; its a bolt. If it is a bolt you definately need to get it out before that
&gt; magic moment that it catches on the starter ring gear and breaks your
&gt; tranny case.

&gt; &gt; I have a 73 2 ltre camper ,it started about 3 weeks ago and seems to
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; getting louder as time goes on , also i noticed that the knocking
&gt; &gt; sound
&gt; &gt; is now apparent even when the clutch is out.I am wondering if my
&gt; &gt; clutch
&gt; &gt; is due for renewal or the flywheel going out , any info on what
&gt; &gt; might be
&gt; &gt; causing this sound would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thnx in advance
