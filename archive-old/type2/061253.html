(Help me find a source for a CDI unit like Bob Hoover wrote about)

So I wrote:
Bob Hoover wrote about the Tiger CDI, made by the Universal Corporation 
in (Grand Junction?) Colorado. Their tech support number is (970) 242-5267.
I'm sure they could transfer you to purchasing, as well as answer your 
questions about the unit. Last I checked these things cost about $75-100. 
You could order one from them, even if you are in the UK.

Apparently they run just fine on early '70's buses. On FI buses, you need 
to build a little adaptor circuit to give the signal wire to the FI 
brain the proper signal. Sami Dakhlia built one just as drawn below 
and it works on his '76 FI. It doesn't work on my '78, and  Stefan Ufer 
told me it didn't work on Mark Stephens' '81 FI Vanagon. Someone else 
told me it didn't work on a '79. Universal Tech Support didn't know 
anyone who'd run one on a late '70's FI bus, but they said replaceing the 
resistor with a (43K?) one made it go on an '83 bus. Stefan Ufer used a 
potentiometer to determine that a 100K, 1 watt resistor would make both 
the VDO tach and the FI go on his '76 bus. This would be a good way to 
figure out what resistance to use for a late '70's bus. 

I got swept up in other events (baby, grad school exams, etc.) and 
haven't finished this project yet. If anyone out there has a '77-'81 bus 
with the airflow controlled fuel injection and has made the Tiger CDI 
work on their rig, please let us know. Or anyone who's enough of a radio 
head to actually calculate what it ought to be from first principles?

Anyways, here's the diagram, as reproduced by Sami from the Tiger &quot;yellow 
page&quot; of instructions that come with the CDI:
