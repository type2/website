Subject: The Bus Tour Update

    Hi All.

   I'm pleased to announce I just returned from the KW Bug Out and handed
off the baton to Colission Corners.
He will forward it to Dave Ireland next week.
The show was mostly a washout with rain all day.
At least 15 busses showed. Good turnout considering the weather.
I even won a cool door prize. 2 40 channel walkie talkies. They'll be great
for travelling.
Just wanted to keep everyone in touch about the tour.
