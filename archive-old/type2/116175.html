Subject: Carburetor Questions

Hey guys,

	I wanted to ask a couple of questions about my carburetor. It
appears that I have a webber 2bbl carburetor installed. It looks to be new.

It has an electric choke on it that is apparently not connected. Where do I
connect this? Can I connect it to the same wire that the igintion coil and
fuel pump is connected to?

Second, I had to adjust the idle screw so that the Bus wouldn't stall.
Before then, if I applied the brakes and took it out of gear, it would tend
to die. I don't have a tach, so I don't know if I'm making the RPMs too
high. Is there any other way for me to know? 

Third, there is a second screw that's actually on the throttle body housing
itself. I'm assuming this is some sort of fuel / air screw. How will I know
if this is adjusted properly? I don't have any manuals for this carburetor.
The carb is new apparently.


Thanks,
