&gt;turned out the bolt holding the engine fan had come out and it was
sticking
&gt;half way out of the engine. So I put it back in and tightened it as much
as
&gt;possible. Is there anything else I need to do?

same thing happened to me, the fan hub came loose. When i pulled the fan
hub off I couldn't even tell there was a keyway there, the two tapered
surfaces looked smooth from spinning together. Fortunately the keyway was
OK on the crank (once the key was removed) and a used fan hub was put on.
The center bolt is only (I think I'm remembering this right) torqued to
70ft/lbs, but no problems since. My mechanic had only heard of this
happening once before.
