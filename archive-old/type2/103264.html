Subject: shawn's transaction with susan

I posted a request for info about shawn and he posted his version of the transaction.  With the
help of friends and level heads the transaction has been resolved.  He has the kit and has
transferred money to me and i have recieved it. So on the surface everyone has what they want.

The lessons to be learned are the ones we always hear and eventually fade and we think it won't
happen to us.

for the seller. don't let someone on your land that you do not know if you aren't personally going
to be there for ANY reason.

for the buyer. if you intend to purchase something make sure you have a SPECIFIC verbal or written
agreement arranged before you visit or do not take the merchandise. When making a purchase with
out the owner present arrange a way to talk to them at the time to confirm things and if possible
get it in writing!

either of us following any of these suggestions would have prevented the hard feelings that
ensued.

But is is water under the bridge and may vw happiness be restored :-))
