Subject: Re: [T2] E10

Sounds like junk to me.  Many states here in the US are working on
mandates to require E10 use.  Furthermore, MTBE is out of favor here
so, ethanol is routinely used for winterizing gasoline.  There are
mixed reports of ethanol corrosion of certain rubbers and aluminum.
However, as with most petrol blends the point for concern seems to
start around 20% (E20 and up).  Personally, I'd run E10 proudly,
without fear, if I could find it.

I'd really love to find a complete FI 2 litre that I could tinker with
and test E85 along with a megasquirt.  I either can't find one or
can't afford it for experimentation.

&gt;         Among the reactions in the media are vague warnings that this
&gt; fuel can dissolve some fuel pipes, gaskets etc.
&gt;         Is there a compilation of N. Amer. experience with E10, which
&gt; I know has been sold for many y?
