Subject: watching the world through the sunroof

There is a dirt road going from Chiracahua National Park in 
southeastern Arizona that goes across the mountain range
into New Mexico. My daughter drove while I and three of my 
sons and my other daughter stood on the seat with our heads
poked out the sun roof. A very memorable experience, though
we had to duck under some low branches. My wife and 
mother-in-law were with us, but did not stick out their necks.
They were worried about flys and other bugs, but at 20 to 
30 mph you can dodge the bugs. 

Anybody know if we broke the law by not wearing our seatbelts?

thanks for the info. :) you ever let someone else drive while you stood
up and looked out the sunroof?? really neat (probably illegal in most
states) ... i did it on a trip to colorado years and years ago. took
pictures as we rode along. other cars looked at us really strangely. ;)
gotta watch out for bugs and tree branches, though.
