Subject: drain plugs again

Hey all; 

Just checking again to see if anyone knew the function of the plastic
drain plugs that cover the fairly large (almost 1cm diameter) hole just
inside of the step of the front cab. The hole is directly underneath the
lower edge of the front door when the door is closed. My '71 van has an
intact plug on one side, and no plug on the other. Do I need to plug the
other side? Remove the plug on the driver's side? 

Secondly, there is another hole of the same size directly behind the
driver's side seatbelt mounting point. This seems to let a fair bit of
moisture/water in when driving in the rain, and has accumulated it's fair
share of rust. 
Plug that one too?? There is no hole in the same place on the passenger
side...Why are these holes there in the first place? It's like the
plethora of holes in the front floor pan...why? don't make sense to my
small brain...tradeoff between allowing water to drain yet allowing water
to leak in during rain driving? 

cheers all
