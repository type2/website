Subject: Getting ready to pull rear brake drum and have a few questions...

Hi all...

I've been patiently awaiting the arrival of my new brake parts from 
BustedBus and they've finally shown up (wish I could've sprung for 2-day!). 
Anyways, I've been reviewing the Bentley and the archives, but I've still 
got a few questions...

Specs first: 1970 Microbus (has early-bay wheels, no reduction box)

History: Original diagnosis from this list (and others) was that the clutch 
and/or throw-out bearing was the culprit. Replaced everything, put her in 
gear and the axle spins, hub spins, wheel doesn't. Determined that either 
the drum is stripped out or the axle splines are gone. Consensus says it's 
the drum, since the splines are hardened steel.

Here's the questions...

1. According to Bentley, I'm supposed to use a drum puller. According to the 
list archives, all I need is a hammer and a prayer. Since the drum or 
splines are stripped, is this even going to be an issue? If a puller is 
recommended, where can I find one?

2. My experience with Bentley instructions is that they always seem to leave 
out an important piece of information (or bury it 20 pages later). I've 
never done a brake job before, but after pulling the engine, replacing the 
clutch/throw-out-bearing/plate I'm feeling pretty confident in my abilities, 
but not so confident about Bentley. Any useful &quot;tricks&quot; I should be aware 
of?

3. I didn't have the cash to replace the other drum (hoping I can have it 
turned). Am I going to have to do anything special since one side will have 
a new one?

4. I've got a new drum, new shoes, and a rear brake rebuild kit. I know I'm 
going to need a 46mm socket. If a hammer can be used instead of the puller, 
are there any other special tools (home-made or otherwise) that will be 
helpful?

5. I've got a floor jack, but no stands. I'm planning on doing one side at a 
time. Do I really need to buy a set of stands for this?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Sean,

1970 Microbus (&quot;Mimi&quot;)
