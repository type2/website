Subject: BA-6 heater installation

Hello Fellow Busers!
        This is I think my third post to the list. You people have been so
wonderful in helping before, so for that I just want to thank &quot;thank you&quot;
to everybody! 

        My latest project is reinstalling the BA-6 heater that came
installed stock in my '78 bus. I ordered the temperature sensor (of some
sort) goes in the heater. It's the only thing that tested bad, according
to the manual I used to have (part # 211 963 261 for all the realists).
Anyone, also I am installing new heater cables on both sides of my bus,
and I am looking for any tips, suggestions, etc. about this heater and
installing new heater cables. I can't wait to have my footsies warmed by
20,000 BTU's one cold winter morning! Please help me get this thing in. If
you have the manual for the BA-6 could you XEROX it for me and sent it to
me, I am more than happy to send you a few bucks for copying/postage.
Thanks again folks, and I am looking to do this next Saturday (11-15).

Take care and have fun!
