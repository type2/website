Subject: Re: [T2] my $100 paint job

&gt;Is this a 20 footer, or a 60 foot paint job?

Don't understand this question.

&gt;For all the work that you did to get the bus a uniform color you should
have spent a couple of more bucks for premium materials to make the
finished product last.

Dude, I researched my options, the money to get a sprayer, and decent paint 
and everything to do a good paintjob would have been more expensive as my 
whole bus.

&gt;I just hate doing the same job twice.
&gt;especially one of this magnitude.

What are you talking about? I had a blast taking my bus apart and painting 
it, I want to do it again, I'm thinking cherry red with black 
bumpers......or maybe a dark blue with white bumpers.
