Subject: RE: [T2] VERY DANGEROUS TO SWITCH TO ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP

&gt; &gt; &gt;the pump receives its power via an oil pressure switch

&gt; &gt; Sounds like a winning idea to me. 


I was thinking exactly the same thing. An excellent solution to the
problem!! 

As for noise on the Facet pumps, they do click when running. I have not
found this objectionable myself, as I can't even notice it when driving
down the road (the engine and road noise drown it out). However it can
be heard slightly at idle. It's quieter than the pump on my BA6 gas
heater was, and even that never really bothered me. (I suppose if I were
using both a Facet pump and a gas heater pump at the same time it could
get quite irritating, with two different pumps clicking out different
rhythms simultaneously. :-)  I have not tried the Pierburg pump myself
but based on Pierburg's other products I would certainly expect it to be
good quality.
