Subject: 78 Sunroof question and gas heater removal

I can't seem to get the sunroof on my 78 to open, when i turn the crank
it just clicks. Does this mean my sunroof is stuck or the gears inside
are stripped? If the gears are stripped, how do i go about fixing it?

Also, I have a gas heater mounted to the underside of my bus. It doesn't
work, so i want to remove it. How would i go about doing this? I can't
find what is holding it to the body. I found the fuel lines are all
rusted too, can i just replace the metal lines from the tank through the
firewall with rubber lines? Is this safe?

Thanks in advance for any help.
