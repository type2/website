Subject: Stupid cooling question...

PO left the bus with no thermostat or pulley. Numerous people have
advised that I should replace or at least make sure the cooling shutter
is open.

I *will* replace as soon as my bank account recovers from shock. In the
meantime, how can I be assured that the shutter is open...er, if I even
have a shutter?
