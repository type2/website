Subject: RE: [T2] Water Pump Wiring

&gt; I would also throw in a resistor to slow the pump
&gt; which will slow the water flow. These pumps seem to
&gt; pump more that what is needed and I hate splashing
&gt; water everywhere and wasting it.


That's a good suggestion. It makes a tankful of water last much longer, you
still get plenty of flow, and you don't splash your clothes every time you
wash a dish. I did the &quot;rig job&quot; version of this on my '77 once, using a
hose clamp to somewhat constrict the water hose leading from the pump to the
faucet. I was a bit concerned that this might harm the pump, but I figured
pumps weren't all that expensive so I'd take my chances with the two-minute
fix. I can't say whether the pump's lifespan was shortened over the long
haul, but it was still working fine two years later when I sold the bus. (Of
course YMMV.)
