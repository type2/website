Subject: Question on Horn wiring, 1973

Volks,

I am having a problem with my 1973.  The horn wire is grounding
somewhere in the column or wiring harness, thus the horn is always on
(when plugged in).  Because I need to get it working for safety
inspection, I have stripped the steering column all the way down to the
steering shaft and still have ground indicated at the ground wire
attaching to the horn.

What I need to know is if this wire at the horn is the one that appears
at the base of the steering cover tube or is the wire that goes up the
center of the steering shaft?

TIA,
Steve
