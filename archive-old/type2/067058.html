Subject: More heater cable (splitty this time)

Thanks Jim, you reminded me to ask...

Where is the on/off heating switch located in a '62 bus (was sunroof
kombi before Martin Walter got his hands on it)?

In all the engine out/in messing around of the past few days I noticed
that the heater cables at the back are connected to the levers, which
are in permanent 'on' position. I've a nasty feeling the PO might have
hidden it behind a load of home-made crap in the cargo area...

It's getting Too Hot in the cab in this weather. Can you believe it? Not
only a splitty with vague heating capabilities, but a hot English summer!!
Will wonders never cease? But I digress. All clues appreciated.

Sarah
