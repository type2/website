Subject: Re: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!

Bigger tax write off?

&gt;i have seen bilboards here in tulsa, ok for people to donate cars, boats
&gt;and other things to charities. i never looked into where they go, though.
&gt;now i have to wonder! then again, if they are scrapping them, then why do
&gt;they need to be running? i dont know if it matters if it runs, here.
