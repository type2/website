Subject: RE: [T2] Anyone try Seafoam?

&gt;From: T Berk &lt;tberk_at_sbcglobal_dot_net&gt;

Anyone try Seafoam?
It's a solvent type spray and/or liquid that you allow to get sucked
up into the motor (until it stalls!) and let sit in the hot
cylinders.

After you let it sit awhile, you fire it back up and there is
supposed to be a tremendous amount of sooty smoke that comes pouring
out of the tail pipe-  and after awhile things are supposed to be
right as rain.

TBerk,

Why I just did this two months ago on a Fuel Injected Domestic car and it 
worked wonders. It exactly what it said it would. I don't have any specific 
data on the changes, but I have noticed an increase in MPG and the car is 
not sputtering anymore at idle. This stuff can be used different ways just 
like you said you basically pour it in until it chokes out the engine and 
then let it soak into the injectors then fire up after a period of time. Or 
it can be used in a fuel injector cleaner machine. YMMV but I would 
recommend it.

TravelOn,
