Subject: Re: [T2] Bleeding brakes [follow up]

&gt; Since these 'flakes' are more than likely rust from the lines, and shrapnel

It doesn't look like rust.  The sediment that came out of the bleed screw at
the front calipers looked like rust and rubber powder.  This stuff looks
like caked on brake fluid or contaminant.

&gt; BUT- Unless you rebuild everything that contains
&gt; that rubber,  and replace your lines, it will be in the same condition as it
&gt; will be if you leave things alone.  It is already in MUCH better shape since
&gt; you bled the old fluid out.  I guess it's up to you, but I wouldn't do
&gt; anything unless I planned on doing it all.

My main problem aside from making up for the horrid lack of brake
maintenance over the years (original everything!) is that the brakes start
to squeal after 15 mins of driving.

After changing the fluid it's much quieter now but there is still a problem;
I wanted to replace the fluid and see what a difference could be made by
only changing the fluid.

Past list advice says the remaining problem is likely due to the original
(FAG DOT 11/77) brake hoses swelling or having become rotten on the inside
so I'll replace them next and see what results.  I'm not trying to cheap
out, I just like to change one item at a time and learn from the results.
