Subject: Teflon Tape on Brake Bleed Valve Threads?

List,

Subject says it all.  I'm trying to bleed my brakes with a hand vacuum pump 
and I've notice that when the bleed nipple is opened there is a little play 
in the threads that allows outside air to short circuit the vacuum.  A thin 
layer of teflon tape around the nipple threads would appear to stop this 
problem but I'm not sure if the tape and brake fluid are compatible.  My 
guess is it's okay but I'd some other opinions first.

Much Thanks

Blue82vw
