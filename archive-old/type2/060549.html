Subject: RE: Water driven heater in ACVW

(sniped)

&gt;&gt; &gt;I have been pondering this idea for a little while, I 
&gt;&gt; figured I should
&gt;&gt; &gt;share...
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I have been playing around with the idea of converting a 
&gt;&gt; heater box type
&gt;&gt; &gt;thing into a water driven heater for a VW......anyone else 
&gt;&gt; thought if this?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Now I don't know if I would use an existing heater box, 
&gt;&gt; ('prolly not) or
&gt;&gt; &gt;come up with some sort of water jacket (thick aluminum 
&gt;&gt; elongated box?) that
&gt;&gt; &gt;would run a good length down one of the exhaust pipes (stock 
&gt;&gt; J-tubes, or
&gt;&gt; &gt;header)
Hey this is a good idea but I have a vaiation that might be simpler. 
Lots of people use a external oil cooler, right? Just move the oil 
cooler to a box that you could direct the air flow. Use an electric fan 
for air flow. A baffle door would direct the air from the inside of the 
Bus through the cooler and back into the Bus in the winter. In the 
summer you just direct the flow of air out under the Bus so you don't 
heat up the Bus on a hot day. One advantage to this is that you would 
not have to deal with water or corosion, the oil is already there and 
hot. Lets not waste the heat. The system is on the car already and no 
need to worry about controling the presure. No need to modify the 
exhaust or add a pump, you have one already. Your Idea sounds good, this 
is just a little simpler and maybe less costly. Basicly you would have 
the oil cooler doing the same thing as the heater core in a water cooled 
car. What do you all think of this?
Could work on a Bug or Bus. With as many creative minds as there are out 
there among us we might be able to refine this to work.
