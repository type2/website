Subject: Re: [T2] Lots of engine questions

Okay - I'll buy that with no problem. It personally has not been a big deal 
for me but I know what you are talking about.

Take care!!!

Chris


&gt;Chris,,, I always recommend NOT turning the engine with the dist out.
&gt;
&gt;reason being,  you can have the drive lift up as you turn the engine, this can
&gt;allow the shims to fall into the engine, but worse, it jams the gear, and 
&gt;people
&gt;can't figure out why the engine &quot;seized&quot;...  they tear it apart,, or scrap 
&gt;it,,
&gt;,,, or just get really frustrated till they find out the drive has lifted as
&gt;they turned the engine,, the gears jammed, and bound up the crank.
