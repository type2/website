Subject: Re: Vacuum gauge install

&gt;Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I installed (well, sort of) a vacuum gauge on my bus this past week, and
&gt;thought some of you might be interested in the results.
&gt;
&gt;I started by removing the oneway valve that is just in front of the front
&gt;engine tin.  
&gt;I started it up and drove around a while.  I have two vacuum gauges at the
&gt;moment, one is a 2-1/16 no-name gauge that reads 0-30 psi in less than a 90
&gt;degree sweep.  The other is a 4&quot; Sears vacuum gauge that reads in
&gt;increments of 1 psi over about 270 degrees.  MUCH more accurate.  The Sears
&gt;gauge showed a max vacuum of about 20 psi (engine warm, trailing throttle)
&gt;with a low of about 2 psi (full throttle - does this mean my throttle plate
&gt;isn't opening all the way?).  Normal idle is around 14 psi.  The smaller
&gt;gauge didn't give much useful information because of it's small sweep.
&gt;
&gt;On the freeway, I was happy to see that very slight changes in throttle
&gt;position produced a noticable change in vacuum.  Cruising at 55 mph, I saw
&gt;around 10 psi on average. 62 mph saw closer to 5 psi, and was getting close
&gt;to floored.  This is going to make a really good MPG indicator.  I'm very
&gt;pleased with this and am going to complete the installation by ordering a
&gt;30 psi vacuum gauge from Summit (new style with fibre optic lit needle,
&gt;$27.95, ) and mounting it in the dash by running the vacuum hose up under
&gt;the floor at the front of the bus.  Despite the great distance in the hose
&gt;(the hose from the tee to the gauge alone was over 20 ft) gauge response
&gt;was pretty much instantaneous.
&gt;
&gt;One big problem with the whole setup - the needle of the vacuum gauge
&gt;vibrates wildly at part throttle.  Enough that it was hard to read and even
&gt;made some noise.  I don't think it's a problem with the engine or gauge - I
&gt;think it's just the result of the engine only producing vacuum during the
&gt;intake stroke(s).  I managed to  reduce the vibration by pinching the hose
&gt;- I was able to pinch it enough so that the gauge still responded quickly
&gt;but didn't vibrate.  My plan is to insert a spare fuel jet into the vacuum
&gt;line to restrict the air flow down to a very small amount.  I figure with
&gt;all of the different sizes of jets available I should be able to find one
&gt;that will be just about right.
&gt;
&gt;That's it, have a good weekend everyone.

  David - 

 Let me say that I have no great skill at diagnosis with a vac gage,
but I'm hoping I may learn in time.

 Having layed out my &quot;curriculum vitae&quot; so to speak we'll get on with 
this.

 I have this old &quot;411&quot; book, Clymers. 

 Gives a page of readings and diagnosis for vacuum gage.
 
 What it is telling me, the ignorant, is that you have valve problems.

 Heres the ones that seem to apply:

 Oscillates ~4&quot; :   worn valve guides

 Violent oscillation, ~10&quot;:  weak valve springs.
 (oscillation increases with rpm) often steady at idle

 Just thought I'd mention it. Not looking to spook you.    west
