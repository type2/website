&gt;
&gt;I discovered that my spare AFM is an 020; not an 018 as came with my '77 
&gt;engine. I recall a recent post regarding the difference between these two, 
&gt;but I never saw an answer. Are these compatible?
&gt;

Yes they are compatible. If you go to the VW dealer and ask for a 018, they 
will tell you it is replaced by the 020.
