&gt; hello

&gt; i have heard about the subaru six in a bug...

 If anything, it should be easier to put it into a bus than a bug.  You
might want to check with Kennedy Engineered Products to see if they have
the adapter plate and flywheel for this engine.  It may well be the same
parts as the Subaru 4 cylinder engine!

Before you start, you need to give serious thought to how you are going to
put a radiator on your bus.  It could go on the front, under the belly, in
the side of the engine bay, in place of the engine lid or even on top like
the Roadcow.  There are pros and cons to each location and there is a lot
of engineering to do to get it right.  Don't think that you can just slap
a radiator and fan on and get good results.  You need a way to prevent
recirculation of air.

You might want to consider getting a watercooled vanagon to perform your
swap on.  All the watercooled parts are there which simplifies the job
considerably.
