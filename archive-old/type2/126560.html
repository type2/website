&gt; Don,

&gt; My experience with the foam seals has been the same as yours.

&gt; Plug seals... I always grab my trusty tube of yellow 3m weatherstrip
&gt; glue and figure out where the seals push down on the insulators to seal
&gt; best and glue them in....maybe pushing them down just a little further to
&gt; make sure they seal around the sheet metal.


What's bugging me is that the seals that came on my wires are barely
larger than the openings. If I push them down far enough that pressure
against the tin holds 'em flat (I was going to RTV them in place) they
just pop through to the other side.

BTW: If ya'll haven't seen this yet, it's a must read!
