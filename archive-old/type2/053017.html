Subject: Broke the habit

After sending our westy to it's room and/or grounding it from all fun in
life, we've finally broke it of smoking.Nasty habit!

Thanks to the archives and Tech pages, we replaced the pushrod tubes and
seals. Alot easier than we expected. Thanks all.

Brice and Michael
73 westy
