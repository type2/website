Subject: [T2]76 Shiftrod etc... restore from bus depot

looking over bus depots site i had to dig a little to find what i need to know if i have the right stuff down before i make a order with them..?
 
i am trying to replace all the bushings and etc for my shiftrod....
 
i have lost 3rd and fourth +reverse and took the shifter apart today and didnt find anything out of the ordinary except i was missing the 9a the stop plate.
the 9. stop plate was there though.... 
 
Looking on page 10 fig 3-15 and again at fig 3-14 there is a break down of what i am looking at replacing.. ((((((((((((((((((((transmission section......)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
 
i have circled  9a,9, and from there i see object 10 which to me looks like a 66-73 bus sleeve not for my bus correct?
 
and then i got to order 14.16,then the rear coupler hopefully containing everything that the rear coupler will need to be new again...?
 
can someone help me here please make sure i get everything ordered i might need..?
i got to get my bus back on the road i start a new job on monday and cant be dropped off at work for long without going insane....
 
the sooner i can get the parts the sooner i will get it fixed.... 
thank you all so much for any time it might take you to give me a hand here...
 
i am looking to making my shiftrod feel new again so i am hoping by making all the bushings new this will do just this???
 
it not going into third or fourth has something to do with up front in the shifter itself but i could not tell what is was?????
 
 
also when looking on bus depot i seen a front bushing that was round and rubbery?? i did not know where this one went cause i dont see it in the bentley...
 
anyone got a updated 76 model or better shematic of the shiftrod and its bushings?
 
again thanks
Cha


Peace,Love%Earth
