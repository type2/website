Subject: '70 Westy For Sale:  Logan, Utah

I'm relocating and have to sell my trusty Westy Camper. I'm looking for
about $1000. Of course any serious offer will be considered.

This bus is located in Logan, Utah. More details and photos at
http://english_dot_usu_dot_edu/adam/armanda/bus.htm

I'm moving to Lincoln, NE.  Hopefully, I won't have to go too long without a
bus.  Darnit, this makes me sad . . .

:(
