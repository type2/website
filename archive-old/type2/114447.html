Subject: Re: Vent Glass - gaining access to a locked bus

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyway Does anyone have a passenger door vent glass laying around for 
&gt;&gt; a 77
&gt;&gt; bus. I couldn't find my keys this morning and somehow ended up locked 
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; the bus. DUH. I couldn't pry it open but the hammer worked just fine.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for any help. oh I'm located on Long island,NY
&gt;

Actually, I've been able to break in to my bus by bumping the front 
edge of the vent wing until the latch works its way around to the open 
position.  Swing the vent wing open, reach in and unlock the door.  
Does any one else out there have a similar experience?
