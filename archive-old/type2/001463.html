&gt;&gt; Just a quick note on this:  The engine mentioned in the original post is
a
&gt;&gt; 2.0.  These carbs that Ron mentions were designed for a 1.7 and they just
&gt;&gt; don't breathe enough for a 2.0 motor

&gt; Yes, but they make great torque down low and provide decent fuel
&gt; efficiency.  Guess it depends on one's tastes - you can definately make
&gt; more top end power with bigger carbs.  Also, these same carbs were
&gt; available in Europe on the 2-liter engines for many years.


These carbs were used just about everywhere in the world besides the U.S.
straight thru the '80's, on 2 liter engines.  I personally feel that they
are better than the Webers for the application (and certainly were designed
for it).  The progressive Weber may provide more top end power, but at the
expense of fuel economy.  The dual Webers are even worse, IMHO, being way
too much carb for the stock Type 4 engine, to the point that even leaned out
they run much too rich. For normal day-to-day driving I like the original VW
carbs, although I must admit that my bias is towards stock rather than
high-performance.  The main reason the Weber progressive has been so
popular, I think, is more due to cost; until now they were the only
reasonable option under $400.
