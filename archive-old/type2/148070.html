Subject: Re: [T2] Silly lock question

Take your new locks and your other key to locksmith and tell them you
want the new locks rekeyed to fit the other key. My locksmith charges
me $20.

 I just received 2 new handles and locks for the 70, and much to my dismay
 they require 2 different keys.  If I was to put them on I would need 3
 different keys just for the doors.  Seems there is a black hole when it
 comes to locks for a 70.  How do I get just one key to work on all 3?
