New update:

Steve got his bus to a shop in Albequerque this morning and found some
problems.  I will let him post about them but I do know they had to replace
his dizzy with an .050 dist.  They also had to do some work on his axle
arms but that didn't have anything to do with the heat of course.  : )

John Kyte in Albequerque e mailed me earlier that Steve is back on the road
and heading west.  He is running cooler but John said he stated he is still
not happy about his oil pressure.

All in all we had well over $1150.00 pledged should Steve need another
engine.  I think you guys should be especially proud.  I am going to keep
your names and address in a file and should you ever have a problem on the
road and become stranded we will do the same for all of you.

I am so proud of ya'll I could just hug every dang one of ya.  Thanks for
answering the call of a Brother pilot in potential need.  Essentially the
1150 was pledged in just twelve short hours.  The pledges ranged from ten
dollars to one hundred dollars.  I think that is mighty damn good teamwork
and dedication to our brother/sisterhood.

Anyway, I hate to sound like we are out of the woods but for now things are
looking better.  In my eyes it hould still be our goal to make sure this
man enjoys his vacation.  Maybe this is the start of a new sense of
comradery on this list, not that the old one is bad, but I hate to see a
bus traveler stranded anywhere.

If any of you need me to help you in any way please contact me.  I will
assuredly be there for you if I can.

Thanks and give yourself a pat on the back.  You guys are great people and
don't you forget it.  If anyone ever doubts that you tell them to write me
and ask.  If they doubt it further I will just have to drive to where they
are and me and my 6.4 285 lb frame will convince them in person.  : )

Good job boys and girls
