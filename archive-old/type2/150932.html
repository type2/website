Subject: Re: [T2] poly-pro gas tanks

&amp;gt;How could you adapt the filler? Does the filler have a cap with a breather 
&amp;gt;on it?

    Well, these fuel tanks are made for permanent mounting and they have a 
filler neck on them (plastic tube) which I'd try to adapt to join up with 
the original rubber filling tube on the bus.  Thus the fuel cap would be the 
original bus one.  The main issue there is that the marine tanks all seem to 
use a 1 3/4&amp;quot; filler neck and the bus uses 2 1/4&amp;quot; or there about.  Basically 
I'd try to find some plastic piece to neck down the roughly 1/2&amp;quot; from the 
larger to the smaller size.  Maybe they sell fuel rated reducer fittings 
somewhere?

     As for the evap system lines we'd be dealing with a brand new plastic 
tank, so I think it would be as simple as drilling a couple holes in the top 
of the tank an getting some brass or plastic barbed fittings from the 
hardware store and using quality 0-rings to make sure they are liquid tight. 
  A little bead of JB weld just to be extra sure.

     These tanks seem to have the fuel nipples either on the top or side.  
I'd have to figure something out with that too....  and that might be more 
challenging.  A couple of threaded fittings would be fine on top since in 
theory they'd never be really submerged in the gas, but to try to put a 
whole or two in the BOTTOM of the tank and put fittings in... I dunno.  It 
may not be possible or easily feasible but I'm still kicking around the 
idea.

     I doubt I'll ever try this, but if I do I'll let everyone know how it 
turns out.
