Subject: type IV intake boots

Hey Y'all,
  I was working on the Bus and was looking at boots that go on the tube 
between the intake manifolds on a 72-74 Bus with the carbs. Mine were 
bad. But I found while looking in my Dads garage that the spark plug 
boots from a Ch*vy V8 are the same as the boots on the Bus. The boots 
are angled at 90 degs and had the right size hole in the one end. I then 
cut 1/2 in off the straight boot and stuffed it in the larger hole in 
the angled boot. It worked perfect! No leak and the boots are able to 
withstand the high heat and the oil/gas. And they cost me nothing. I 
found that there are about 5 of these boots on the motor and they are 
all the same. So it helps to be creative and may save you some money.
