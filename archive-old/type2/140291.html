Subject: Re: [T2] Re: pair of wiper arms 68

Larry said:


 Somewhere on the internet there is, or used to be, a site that tells about recalls for various cars. I think
that's where I read that those side bolt wipers were a VW recall back in '68 or '69. The great advantage of
this later style is that it will grab virtually any wiper post no matter how much its been destroyed by its
original arm and not let go. Visualize grabbing on to one of your digits after hitting it unexpectedly when
your wrench slips.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The site is http://www.nhtsa_dot_com
The recall applied to 3,700,000 type 1's, type II's, and type III's from 1949 to 1967. It did not apply to
1968 buses.
The recall is number 72V256000. It was filed on 10/12/1972.
To find it the easy way, click on the link above. When it opens, you will see Vehicles &amp; Equipment in the
middle section [stay away from the same named tab on top!!]. Right below it a clickable link titled Recalls
Search From Office of Defects Investigation (ODI). Click on it. When the new window opens, enter 72V256000 in
the box in the middle below
Quick Search. You will get this:

            Make / Models :           Model/Build Years:
                 VOLKSWAGEN / VOLKSWAGEN       1949-1969

            Manufacturer : VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA,INC

      NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID Number : 72V256000  Mfg's Report Date : OCT 12, 1972
      Component: VISIBILITY:WINDSHIELD WIPER/WASHER
      Potential Number Of Units Affected : 3700000
      Summary:
       THE SET SCREW LOCKING THE WINDSHIELD WIPER ARM TO THE DRIVING SHAFT MAY WORK LOOSE. IF THIS HAPPENS, IT
WOULD CAUSE ERRATIC WIPER OPERATION AND THE COULD CAUSE WIPER OPERATION TO CEASE ENTIRELY.
      Consequence:
       LOSS OF WIPER OPERATION WOULD IMPAIR ROAD VISIBILITYDURING INCLEMENT WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY
RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT.
      Remedy:
       INSPECT AND REPLACE WITH NEW TYPE WIPER ARMS WHERE NECESSARY.
      Notes:
       SYSTEM: VISUAL SYSTEMS; WINDSHIELD WIPERS.VEHICLE DESCRIPTION: PASSENGER CARS; BK MODELS TYPE 1, TYPE
2, AND TYPE 3.
