am  skeptical about 2mm deep.... are the pushrods that thick you could  
actually groooooove them 2mm deep.... anyway ,,, what I was going to  say,,, 
I have seen that from weak valve springs,, the valve floats at  higher rpm 
and the pushrod wobbbbles .... the amount of flex will  determine how wide 
the band of scratches are.. or grove as you put  it...  if you continue to 
over rev the valve springs and float the  valve... the deeper the damage..

just a guess..

hey Jamie   Most common cause is not getting the retainer spring  that is 
suppose to hold the tubes in its proper place. If the spring is inside  the tube 
instead of outside it will do just this later  Mark  Dearing
