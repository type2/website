Hi Andre
Chuck here in BC
I can't speak for the eastern leg of your trip but I'm up and down the west
leg every couple of months. You'll find the rest stops in Calif,Oregon and
Wash to almost all be clean and safe. Everyone I've been too has be well
populated especially at night when they become truck towns, thank God they
separate the trucks and cars. In Oregon and Washington you can usually find
free coffee at most of the stops. One nice thing is away from the cities
you'll find on about every 50mi's. I think I've managed to hit almost every
one in the past couple of years. 'Course if you manage to hit the Island
there's alway my driveway where you can hide amongst the buses.

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;  I will be  taking a trip across the U.S.A  and Canada  at the end of
&gt; February . I live in Quebec
&gt; Canada near the Vermont border. I would like to drive south to Florida
&gt; first, then across to California
&gt;  then up the west coast to Vancouver Canada and back to Quebec.
&gt;
&gt;  This being  my first long trip in my 1975 newly restored  Westy. I
&gt; would really appreciate it  if
&gt;  any of you experienced folks would give me advice as to where I could
&gt; camp cheaply while on the road, (newly retired couple) and what to look
&gt; for as far as security
&gt;
&gt;  I am quite comfortable with the possible mechanical problem since I
&gt; spent the last 2 years
&gt;  restoring the van. I also am a new member of the airs list (note posted
&gt; yet) and I will carry a copy of
&gt;  the list with me on the road.
