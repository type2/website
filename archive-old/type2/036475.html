Subject: Re: Pulling a steering wheel

It IS possible to use a standard puller set to get a VW steering wheel
off.
The trick is to take 2 of the long bolts and get nuts that fit them.
Loosen the big nut but leave it on to protect the threads and give a
bigger area for the puller to sit on.
Remove the turn signal assy, under plate etc to gain access to the bottom
of the st wheel.
Now set up the puller with the long bolts threaded through the big holes
 and put the nuts on undeneath and crank...crank...crank...POP.
You get the picture I hope. I will make a picture show if anyone needs to
see it.
