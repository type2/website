Subject: Why am I selling (MY BABY)??

The bus according to my travels is in great shape.  It has a few blemishes, 
but is for the very most part rust free.  The German Road inspection is very 
detailed and tedious.  Only the toppest notch vehicles pass this inspection.  
They encourage new car ownership and older car retirement.  Not to say there 
isn't older cars on the road but they are in great shape.  I have put a lot 
of time and money into prepping my RENEGADE for this inspection but have ran 
out of time.  It has been a dream come true, but I i know I have three years 
to either build a replacement while there or to restore this one if need be.  
I would rather see it kept stateside as the numbers over here are surely 
dwindling by the year, and I can get just about anything I want over there, 
from complete resto, to Porsche powered.  I'll give one more run down on the 
bus and it's contents along with repairs and needed repairs and if your are 
interested, great, if not pass it on, I'm down to less than a month to have a 
decision finalized.

Well that's about it, she goes 100 miles R/T daily for work and has been 
faithful for all my camping excursions, shows, and cruises, not to mention 
grocery shopping.  The price is fairly locked with minimal room for 
bargaining, partly due to the dollar amount of all the new parts these past 
few months.  Hate to part with but I know what's available to me on the flip 
side.  $1500.00 o.b.o.   760-254-9836  Dagget Ca, (Barstow)
