Subject: [T2] mechanic part 2

hey all,
posted a couple of weeks ago that my girlfriend in Riverside was looking for 
a mechanic, thanks for all the replies. Unfortuately the names you guys sent 
are on my computer back home in BC and I've come down to cal to help her out. 
There was a roving mechanic and a shop in montclair, could you guys please 
repost their names. If any of you are conversant in D-jetronic could you p 
mail me before I go insane. Bus content, comeing down last fri, saw a bus 
being towed into Sacramento around midnight near the airport. Any listee's or 
was it midnight auto at work.
Chuck
