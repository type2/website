Subject: 75 westy interior question
Mime-Version: 1.0

I'm trying to determine if the table arm and mounting that is on my bus is 
original or was taken from a new bus by the PO.

I have one of those L-shaped arms bolted to the side of the sink unit.  The 
table top isn't original (round w/ shelf paper...yuk!)

Anyway, I was looking at this picture of the interior 
(http://www.type2_dot_com/library/camper/westpics.htm)
and I was wondering, which table came with the deluxe westy.

Thanks volks!

Missy:)
