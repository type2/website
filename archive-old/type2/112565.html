Subject: Re:Timing Help?'s

I got a reply the other day about finding TDC by removing the #1 spark plug and 
sticking the eraser end of a pencil down the hole and whe thy piston is at it's 
highest point you got TDC. They also mentioned something about it not being the 
exhaust stroke? Can someone elaborate on that and how to tell if this is the 
exhaust stroke or not?
