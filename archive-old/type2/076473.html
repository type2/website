Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question

Access Systems sends:

&gt; nah it is so those klutzes at Midas can weld em rather than getting em
&gt; bolted together right

Oh yeah, that's right. Thanks for setting me straight.

(They're not klutzes, they're good professional mechanics...who know that if
they were to bolt the muffler on, you'd just unbolt it when it got a hole in
it and bolt on a new one, but if they weld it on you have to take the car
back and give them $75 to replace it for you. Come now! Hasn't anyone ever
explained upselling to you?)
