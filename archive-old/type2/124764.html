Subject: RE: [T2] Bus for sale

Then there is the 5000 buses made people used to have with Porsche
motors in them you know...Too bad none of them survive today...
:)

...
yeah mine as a daily driver and I love coming out to the parking lot and
have someone tell me &quot;I used to have one&quot;  sometimes I reply &quot;I still
do&quot; sometimes I think, sucker! for selling it... or some other less than
kind thing, but not out loud to them...
