&gt; Hi with the high milage never rebuilt 78 Westy......
&gt; With 226,000 mi on my steering (original bearings still rolling), I'm
&gt; getting enough up and down play in the relay lever to throw the wheels
&gt; when going over bumps due to the transferred loosness to the tie rods.
&gt; Is it a DIY project to replace the bushing in the relay lever housing,
&gt; or is this a professional job?  I'm thinking of the difficulty in
&gt; popping off the relay lever, and whether driving the old bushing 
&gt; downwards will be a problem, since so little room is present from above-
&gt; Bentley shows a slide hammer with a special impact driver- how can this
&gt; be jury rigged?

I used a simple puller made from sockets, a short length of water pipe,
and a length of 3/8 all-thread.  The pipe has to be bigger than the outer
diameter of the bushings, the socket has to be slightly smaller than the
OD of the bushings, the pipe has to be longer than two bushings, and the
all-thread has to be longer than the sum of the pipe, the swing lever
pivot pin, and the socket.

Using this puller, I removed both the top and bottom bushings through the
bottom of the beam.  I pulled the new bushings in from their respective
sides using the same tool, minus the pipe.  On the bay buses you don't
have to ream the bushings.

 &gt; No one
answered on how to check for play in tie rods using ordinary &gt; tools BTW.

With wheels off the ground, grab the tie rod and wiggle it.  If you feel
play it is too much.
