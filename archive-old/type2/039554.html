Subject: CV joint 1/2shaft compatible with 76

Volks: I'm getting a clunking when I back up that I suspect is a CV joint.
I'd like to get a used - what I would call from my Datsun days - 1/2 shaft
which I could either replace the bad one with, or rebuild first and then 
replace the bad one. By half shaft I mean the shaft with the two CV joints 
that goes from the differential to the rear wheel axle. 
My question is: What years would fit on my van which is an
(early)  1976. I am assuming this part is common across several years, 
and will do better at a junk yard if I'm flexible WRT  year.

Thanks
Bill Crick
76 Type II/IV/VII
