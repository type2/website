Any body want my thing? I would like to sell or trade my 73 thing for 
a pre 67 bus.
Its a 73 white black top,1600dp,fac. roll bar,new clutch and p.plate, 
new ball joints 
and tie rods, top is good bowed a little,curtains are fair,paint is 
fresh, it looks bone stock. 
It is not a show peice but looks good, asking 3500.00 or trade for 
bus or bug.
Thanks,
