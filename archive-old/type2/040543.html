As you found out, 40W does not give you significantly better pressure than 
20W50, and 30W will give you less pressure.  I know this even though I have 
never raced VWs.  Your FLAPS guy probably drag raced VWs.  Drag racing VWs 
doesn't tell you squat about hot oil because there is never time for the 
engine to heat up in a 1/4 mile run.  There are people who roadrace 
aircooled Porsches (including 914's with their very VW-like engines) - 
those are the people I would talk to about what oil to run - they will know 
their stuff.  Road racing pushes an engine to it's limits, which is sort of 
similar to how a 60hp engine feels behind a 3200lb bus all the time - it is 
constantly at or near its limits.

&gt;Now, the slightest pressure on the gas pedal makes the
&gt;pressure come up and the light go off, so it's
&gt;*possible* that my idle's set too low. But if that's
&gt;the case, why does this only happen after highway
&gt;travel, not around town?????

Cuz highway travel really heats up the engine, and city driving hardly does 
at all.  The main reason this is so is that city driving only loads the 
engine intermittently, while highway driving loads it constantly.

Your flickering light problem is an indication that your oil temp is higher 
than normal.  Make sure your idle is not too low and that your cooling 
system is functioning properly.
