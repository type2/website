&gt; Does anyone have recommendations for the best buy on a pair of heads for a 74

California Imports has them.  1800 and 2.0L can interchange.  If you want to
connect the (Oh, no, Mister Bill!) smog pump, a shop will have to drill and tap
the passages.  Under $400 new.  Watch out for rebuilts, it seems that art is
being lost.  Absolutly avoid GEX.  RMMW sent me GEX last time.
