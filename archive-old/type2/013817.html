Subject: How wide can you go in a  bus without cutting the guards?
Date: Wed, 25 Jul 2001 12:01:03 GMT


Bit of a strange query here, I'm starting in on a project on a '75 DC 
basketcase (rusted out), and am trying to work out what the maximum width will 
be (front &amp; rear) for standard height tyres to fit in without cutting the 
guards (IE: keeping the tyres within the standard body line, possibly trimming 
the inner lip).

I've seen figures for raised Busses with tall off-road tyres, but that's not 
the way I'm going. (Got offered an deal I couldn't refuse on a set of Mercedes 
stud pattern 18&quot; mags http://neale_dot_org/images/antera.jpg .)

Any suggestions or information would be greatly appreciated.
