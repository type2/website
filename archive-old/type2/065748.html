Subject: Fuel injections questions:

1) Clean fuel injectors. You could buy a bottle of Techron, whatever it
is, at Chevron, and soak 'em. I'd wipe the grunge off first :) but don't wipe
grunge over either end... kinda like diapering technique... 

2) Don't know what the manifold is made of. The light film of oil
should be unecessary. :) I'd, personally, clean up the manifold tubes
with orange hand cleaner and a stiff brush, inside and out, then maybe  
dish detergent and hot water bath.  If you've got rust, it's iron or steel 
and needs treatment, primer and paint. If aluminum, no paint OR an aluminum 
primer and  then paint. Both iron and aluminum can discolor like brass, and 
vice versa. Clean it up, then you'll know. ('Brass' color could be brass
brazing rod used to repair damage to a steel/iron tube...

3) The individual injectors do not need to go back to the same cylinder.
However, I would probably put the same injector WIRES back to the same
cylinder's injectors. Of course the same fuel hose goes back- it only
goes together one way.
        I think you've got a D-Jet (Two 'breaker' points on the  
distributor for the FI system?) and also think they actually spritz all four 
injectors at the same time. Don't think the particular wire makes a difference
BUT it might, why take a chance unless you already don't know which goes where?
:)

DO make sure you use new injector-to-manifold seals- air leaks here
give you a lean-running engine which can and will overheat!!

4) Thin gaskets are typically not reusable. RMMW's seal and gasket set
shows what appears to be a dual-port intake gasket, but for the 2l FI
engine the whole set of seals and gaskets is $69. You could try your
local VW dealer or various after market people (WCM, RMMW, Bus Boys).
Personally, with my 914 I found that Automobile Atlanta were helful and
knowlegable about Type IV FI engines. Look for their add in european car
magazine. I'd be very surprised if they didn't have the gasket you need.
They were big fans of the FI system and had taken the time to learn how
it worked.

5) Can't help on oil seals, never done it myself.

        Happy motoring,
        Bill
