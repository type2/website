&gt;This is a prime example of a &quot;slash and burn&quot; repair job. Someone's fuel

&gt;Instead of buying a fuel sender and having it ready, meanwhile keeping
&gt;track of your mileage and fill-ups on a notepad
&gt;until you're ready to pull the motor for other reasons, then take that
&gt;opportunity to R&amp;R the fuel sender and  tank when
&gt; the motor is out, someone got the idea to saw a hole in the floor of the
&gt;bus above the fuel tank area and replace the sender
&gt;that way. Who cares about the structural integrity of the van, that fact
&gt;that the road and motor sounds and fumes will begin
&gt;to inevitable pollute the bus through this hole. 


Just FYI,

The &quot;cut a hole&quot; procedure is what Volkswagen is described in the original 
German workshop manuals, complete with methods of closing the hole again 
after the sender is replaced, i must admit i was kinda amazed to find it 
in there myself. i am the lucky owner of a single cab, i can replace the 
sender simply by removing one of the fuel tank access covers.
