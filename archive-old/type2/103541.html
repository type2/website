&gt; Draining out a tank can be quite a surprise.  I've been at it for three

&gt; I swear my tank was near empty when I parked my bus about a year ago, but

&gt; the fuel keeps a-coming!

If your bus was blessed with a &quot;straight in&quot; filler (early bays), you can
get most of the gas out with a syphon hose before messing with the fitting
underneath.

The tank intentionally has a quart or so of &quot;dead&quot; fuel below
the outlet so that water can collect there rather than going out the
outlet all in one gallumph.  The theory is that sloshing will move the
water out in small drabs so your engine will be able to handle it without
dying.  Removing the outlet fitting (on tanks so equipped) will release
the &quot;dead&quot; fuel and whatever has been lurking on the bottom of your tank,
even if you have allowed the outlet to drain completely.

One big source of fires when folks are under cars is a sudden rush of fuel
that causes the victim to be startled and drop a tool.  Even if you're
getting a gasoline bath hang onto that tool!
