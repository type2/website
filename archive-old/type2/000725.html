Subject: NC VW Show

Just wanted to let people in central North Carolina know that Sundays
News&amp;Observer had an ad under 'Autos Classic &amp; Specialty' advertising a VW
Show sponsored by the VW Club of NC.  The ad reads &quot;VW Show Sept 8th! Food,
Music, Prizes, Awards, Rick 359-9700 VW Club of NC&quot;.  I called Rick and
registration starts at 9:00 to 10:00 if you wish to enter your vehicle.  He
said there will be live music, food, etc and that so far he has about 50 VW
owners that he expects to show up.  Busses, Beetles, anykind of VW is
welcome.  He also said there will be a swap meet so if you have items you
would like to sell bring them.  I am not affiliated with this event in any
way.  Just thought some of you might be interested in attending.  It will be
held at his used car lot on Hwy 70 in Clayton, about 12 miles east of
Interstate 40.  If you need more info call Rick at 919-359-9700.
