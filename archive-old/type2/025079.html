&gt;Hello Listees,
&gt;I'm looking for a full width rear seat/bed for a 68-79 westy.  This was an 
&gt;option, I believe, but I have only seen one in my life. 


My '75 deluxe (sold it this week... sob!), had the full width rear 
seat/bed.

I thought it was standard on the '75 deluxe westies..

Dave,
ex '75 westy.
