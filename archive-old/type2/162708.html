Subject: Re: [T2] OT Friday float.

well the news is reporting on the flooding in the Southern Part of the USA
and in one film clip there is a new beetle floating in the flooded street.
however it was not running and not going anywhere.  so I guess the new
ones aren't as usefull as their older cousins.
