&gt;&gt; Let me know if anyone has any bright ideas.  I'm definitely getting

&gt; stop right there. If you are having real problems w/ a fi system
&gt; then you really need to just start at the beginning of the bentley
&gt; FI section and go through every step. Something is amiss this way
&gt; you can find exactly what it is.

Well, it HAD been running but always ran rough on cold start....I replaced 
exhaust prior to taking it to get emissions check (still haven't
gotten there).

Then I replaced wires, plugs, points, cap, rotor and fuel filter just
because it was time and I hadn't done it since buying it a couple
years ago (I've barely driven it). 

I've only got the Haynes manual but nothing I've checked in either
ignition or fuel sections seems wrong.

I think this gremlin is tiny and due to age.  I think I've killed the
bigger, really obvious ones.

&gt; Oh on the sensor, you can check 2 places IIRC. One right where the
&gt; connection is, but the other is at the other end of the wiring
&gt; harness. one of the terms goes directly to the sensor, might be
&gt; worth checking the resistance there as well, just to eliminate any
&gt; bad connections. consult the bentley for the correct number term.

That's a thought.....I will do that.  

On finding the sensor resistance below spec last week I left it
disconnected and the van started and ran with idle slowly increasing
(I figured disconnect made resistance infinite so computer would keep
adding fuel or air depending on what its supposed to do to
compensate).

Perhaps the wire in the harness may also be to blame.
