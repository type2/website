Subject: Re: Do two thin wires = 1 thick wire?

&gt; Ok, I know this is a little on the cheap side, but that 10 or 12 guage wire
&gt; is so so expensive.  I was wondering:  If I use two 16-guage wires, does
&gt; that improve the power handling and efficiency of the wires?

Okay, let's be blunt: It's a lot on the cheap side. I bought a roll of
12-gauge stranded wire for $5 in genuine Yankee cash, including thirty cents
for the governor. Genuine NAPA Belden wire, none of this cheap junk from
Lower Slobovia. There was enough wire in there to go all the way around a
Bus. And a roll of 10-gauge with less wire on it (but still enough to reach
between any two points on any Bus you've got) was the same price. And with
every color you could ever imagine, you can hardly go wrong.

You wouldn't be the guy who's got the used tea bags hanging on the
clothesline, would you? Use the right stuff.
