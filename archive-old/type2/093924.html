Ok--here we go--more than any other vehicle ever?

Nay--Nay---

Model T Ford (truck, car,)  has us beat hands down---then I would say

I was also thinking that probably more miles have been put on aircooled
VW Buses than any other van/truck ever. 1950-something till '83. That's
a lot of roadtrips and there are still tons of buses with 250,000 miles
on them.

I talked to one old man a short while ago who had 425,000 miles on his
bus before he retired it. Jan B
