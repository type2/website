Subject: Re: [T2] anti-seize


&gt;   as far as throwing
&gt;your torque values off, he is correct in this to a
&gt;point but that would be with anything you add to a
&gt;bolt, nut, fitting, etc.

Different substances provide different coefficients of friction. Light oil 
alters torque very little. Antiseize or grease would change torque a bunch.

Only three or four times in the last 20 years have I removed a VW air 
cooled spark plug and seen the thread insert come out with the antiseize 
problem as foundation. The antiseize seized. Everytime it happens, I ruined 
their motor, so I should fix it at my cost.

Believe me, I have REASONS to hate anti-seize on spark plug threads.

If you use it, only a very light film, and make it the high temp copper 
based, not the aluminum based. And ablut every third time you pull a plug, 
you should chase the buildup out of the threads. That's the problem, it 
builds up under subsequent applications.

Better, 2 or three drops of light oil.
