Subject: Re: sunroof instead of a poptop

Ok y'all.  I just gave my friend the sunroof from my 79 for his 68.  Yes it
fits and works, but it is not just a bolt on affair.

First off you need the tabs off the donor to put on the donee bus.  These tabs
push the back of the sunroof up when closing.  These need to be welded on.
Measure good, because where these go is very important.

Also, what we need help with is.  How do you put the drain tubes in?  Westy's,
at least the 68 have a big triangular hole in the front corners of the hole
(over driver and passenger).  When it rains the water is coming inside.  How
did y'all work thru this?

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy

&gt; &gt; A standard roof and a sunroof (same as sliding roof) are two different
&gt; &gt; animals.  If you want to stay vw, you would have to chop your roof and
&gt; &gt; replace, otherwise you could get a cheap pop up roof from an auto parts
&gt; &gt; store.  I am sure all the purists are grinding their teeth right now, and
so
&gt; &gt; am I.
&gt; Well,

&gt; He said he had a pop-top 70 bus.  I believe most 68-73 or so westies with
&gt; poptops were built on sunroof bus shells without the sunroof.
&gt;
&gt; So converting a 68-73 westy to a sunroof is a bolt on affair, and easy to
&gt; do.
&gt;
&gt; BUT, converting any other bus without the double walled roof to a sunroof
&gt; bus would be a PITA and not worth it as far as im concerned.
&gt;
&gt; take care,
