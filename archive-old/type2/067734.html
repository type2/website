Subject: Re: rear coupler screw

&gt;&gt;I really dont know how to
&gt;&gt;get it out. I dont think I can use an easy out cause
&gt;&gt;it relies on there being threads to come out on. I can turn the
&gt;&gt;bolt, (it is the sqaure headed bolt that holds the rear
&gt;&gt;coupler on the tranny input shaft) just fine, it just won't
&gt;&gt;go anywhere. Please help......

This is not to contradict anything the Rev. Hoover said, I'm sure he's
quite right about all of it, but a few other considerations:

If it's your only ride, there's probably no harm in driving it around to
FLAPS and such to get parts. I have had the same bolt you're talking about
get loose and fall COMPLETELY OUT of the coupler and even so I still had
3rd and 4th gear and managed to get the bus home. My clutch was not pleased
but it hung in there.

I only just now found out the thing was supposed to be square-headed and
cone-nosed. I have a regular old 13mm bolt in there reefed down tight and
it does fine. But do it the right way because YMMV.
