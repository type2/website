&gt;  I recently purchased a 1973 Bus. It's still a work
&gt;in progress. The one thing that eludes me is, the name
&gt;for the bus. It's not a Kombi, Westy, or Camper.
&gt;Here's a brief body description: On the Driver's side
&gt;there's no panel with windows. In other words there's
&gt;no windows on that side, it's all paneled off. Every
&gt;dealer of parts and mechanics I've talked to have

Hi all,

Well there's plenty of these over here (Australia) and they're know as Panel
Vans (do I need to explain why, I would guess not) Anyway, they normally
only have windows in the front, the sliding door and the rear.  Most of them
end up getting the panels or some panels cut out and windows grafted in or
get a mattress in the back and a couple or curtains along with some 70's
shagpile over everything and become a teenage escape ;)

I think there's one on my Wild VW site at (yep third Bus page not easy to
see though) http://www.geocities_dot_com/motorcity/garage/1811

Hope this helps
Cheers
Steve
