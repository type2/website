Subject: Re:smog pump/pulley

Hi,

I have a '74 that needs the pulley for the smog pump. Obviously, I live
in California and have to have it smogged. My mechanic says that they
aren't available new. The pulley that I have is missing a bearing and is
welded so, you couldn't put another one in.
Any idea where to look for one?

TIA,

Tina
