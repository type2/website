Subject: 009 dizzy out, stock in, running rich, hard to keep idle
Message-ID: &lt;3749FC85.2E1777EC_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

See scoobs never ending dizzy story for prior details...

HELP, OK I have the timing set at 7.5 btdc, but it is running really
rich.  I have had to set the idle to almost it's highest opening to get
close to 850/900 rpm.  It does have advance!  I did not rev it to high
as something is needing adjustment still.  But it did advance up into
the 20's, so I think the mechanic was ..... to be determined.

Any ideas on why I am having trouble in getting the idle/timing combo
correct?  I checked all the vacuum hoses, they are all in their correct
places (thanks Karl)?  I am at wits end, I appreciate all the help so
far. Thanks,
Scott
