This is where I bought my 1972 7 seater bus from 2 years ago.  That sign was
posted up there then too.  I haven't been by in a while, but I would guess
that things continue as always at VW Parts and Restoration. I may be wrong.
I hope not. Volkswayne_at_yahoo_dot_com should know, it is his place.

&gt; 
&gt; All,
&gt; Last weekend I came upon a VW shop w/hundreds of old Vdubs sitting around &amp;
&gt; a big &quot;commercial property for sale&quot; sign out front. I wandered through the
&gt; yard, taking pictures. Looking at the pictures I can count 30 type IIs, from
&gt; splits to vanagons, 14 of them campers. The building is a huge rambling
&gt; affair, just chock full of partially finished  Vdubs &amp; parts, mostly used.
&gt; I don't know what will happen to all this stuff when the property is sold,
&gt; but I have a bad feeling the crusher is waiting.
&gt; I have no connection to the place, I'm just a gear-head Vdub fan passing on
&gt; the info to anyone who might need parts or a project, while they are still
&gt; there.
