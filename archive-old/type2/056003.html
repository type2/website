Subject: Re: Bus handling/steering feel: update.

If there is little play in steering when you do the rock steering wheel
side to side, but wander on the road, then I would consider checking toe
in,  which must exist to allow wheels to want to return to center... very
easy to do; relatively easy to adjust yourself.  It's described in Muir.
Any slight bend of the tie rods will reduce the toe-in.  Find a way to
create a telescoping rod at least as wide as the front wheels- a dowel
within a small pipe comes to mind.  You can measure tires front and back,
but I like to use the rim lip since I know I'll be parallel- put wheels
straight ahead and measure front distance and mark via pencil where
telescoped rod comes out of pipe.  Now do same for rear.  You should see
the mark come out about 1/8&quot; - if not or negative toe in, the adjustable
tie rod must be lengthened by loosening locknuts, soaking in Liquid wrench,
and twisting CENTER of the rod with a vicegrip.  I've seen some that were
so locked up with rust, I had to remove entire rod to play with a torch on
a bench vise.
