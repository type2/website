Subject: Re: [T2] Short in Wiring

Frank:

I had this happen to me a couple months back.  My problem was the fuse box had shifted and the back of it shorted against the chassis.  The reason the black ignition wire fries is that it doesn't go through a fuse, it just goes to the fuse box, then straight back to the coil.  At least on my bus it does.  This is not a good thing, since any wire that has 12V on it without a fuse can be a fire hazard.  When my ignition wire fried, it started a small fire under my dash, which luckily I was able to pull off the freeway and blow out.  I fixed the fuse box, then ran a brand new black wire from the coil up to the ignition switch.  I'd suggest that you start looking at these 2 things.

&gt;Hello All,
&gt;I will try again.  This time, any ideas on how to find a short?  My main
&gt;black wire on the ignition harness gets very hot and has melted
