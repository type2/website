Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [vanagon] sand blasting/paint prep &amp; walnut
  media???

Agreed there for sure Terry. The angle grinder is a blunt force trauma item,
like killing a fly with a Louisville Slugger! It hits too large of an area.
I ended up taking vast swathes off the front paint on my bus, and pretty
much brush painting it with Rustoleum type paint. Not too fine a grade of
work, but most of the surface rust spots have not rebled through. I like the
way the metal looks after cleaning it with the wire wheel, it just glows and
gleams, unlike the rough look of the quarter sized spots from the blaster,
not to mention the racket of my compressor hammering away in the background.
I just found that the spot blaster was taking too long for what I had to do.
I agree that for spot refinishing rivets it would be ideal. It's there in my
armoury for when I need it.

&lt;Problem is with my 4&quot; 3/4 horse Milwaukee grinder is it removes waaaay too
much metal beyond where the corroded area's are--same with my 6' or 3&quot; air
grider---

I'm pretty happy with the unit I have--and for focused rust spot clean
up and paint prep you just can't beat it--

Later,

Terry&gt;
