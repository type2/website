&gt;Doc Tim is spot on. 

He's right when he says 100% of valve failures are caused by improper servicing and  maintenance.  In other words, 0% of the failures are caused by hydraulic lifters.  :-)

&gt;Another thing to think about this summer. Those of us running the engine hard and hot like on the interstate and then stopping for food and gas. I believe if you shut the engine off while it is really HOT it will &quot;hot soak&quot; and the engine temps will go up for a while after the engine is stopped and this can lead to valve seat problems. Back off 10 mph for the last minutes pre-stop, or at least idle the engine for a few minutes after you stop. Dump some of that heat.

Agreed, I do this religiously.  When I go racing, I notice that all of the Porsches take cooldown laps - they understand this issue too.
