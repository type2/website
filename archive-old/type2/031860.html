Subject: Gearing in late bays?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.33.0107081255130.25822-100000_at_defiant.bie.ispi_dot_net&gt;


In doing my research about putting a 2L T4 in a splitty bus, I was
wondering if I could get a little help here with a question or 2 that I
have.

What is the gearing in a 1976 bus with the &quot;steep geared trans&quot; as it was
put to me.  Do we have a list someplace with the tranny ratios in it?

What I want to compare is what the gearing of the baywindow trannies that
were coupled to 2L engines were versus the gearing of a split window bus
with a freeway flyer transmission and reduction boxes.  I've traveled in a
1976 baywindow with a 2L engine, steep geared trans, towing a trailer, and
pulling hills and headwinds.  It seems that a lot of the time we were in
3rd and doing 55 - sometimes 60 but could never maintain speed in 4th at
all so back to 3rd we went.

Now since a bay is 1000 pounds heavier than a splitty, I'm kind of curious
about the comparisons between the 2 setups so that I'll have an idea of
what a 2L T4 engine is capable of in a splitty with the aforementioned
gearing.

Thanks for the help.
