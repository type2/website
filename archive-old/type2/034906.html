Subject: Re: curtains

What i did for curtains was have my girlfriend cut up a big tapistry to fit 
each window. the left over material fit the front area and hung right behind 
the front seats. I later found that the one ply material didn't block the 
light that comes out of the friendly neighborhood police officers 
flashlights. My solution was to get my new girlfriend to line the backs with 
brown courdaroy (worked good because my bus is brown and yellow).
   I hung them with strong non-streatching string from nub to nub. Still 
works good although slightly faded from the sun...
