Subject: Gearbox

desperately need a 1600 gearbox -early type without the hanger holes-just put
in a later box of unknown parentage and it whines almost as badly as the one I
took out -3 questions,would I be best to have my old one recond,anyone know of
a good(cheap reconditioner) and what do I need to look for in a?goodsecond
hand unit.By the way I'm in the UK-any help appreciated.I know that the box
could go on for some time whining as my friends has whinned for the last five
years but it just drives me mad as it's my daily driver and i spend a lot of
time driving in slow traffic when the whine is moast noticble --i've tried
turning up the stereo but this is difficult when youneed to talk to the
wife-Cheers Martin
