I don't understand what you mean by &quot;auxillary wires&quot; but to have an
ammeter work, you have to have it &quot;in line&quot; with the main (and only) + wire
to the battery.  This doesn't generally work very well because of the
location of the alternator and battery.  Voltmeters are a better choice to
monitor the condition of your batteries.

&gt;Any idea about what guage wire I should be using for this purpose of
&gt;charging the 2nd battery?  The wire will run from the alternator to an
&gt;isolator that will charge the second battery.

8 gauge is probably adequate but I use 4 gauge.  Check the archives for
lots and lots and LOTS of information on this subject (including isolators).

&gt;2nd question:  I want to wire up a fuse box from the positive lead of
&gt;the 2nd battery for my auxillary Power needs.  Any ideas where I might
&gt;be able to get a VW Bus Fuse box for this purpose?  

Junkyard.
