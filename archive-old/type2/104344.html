Subject: Re: [T2] which battery wire is positive?

Hi Brennan,

On a 25 year old vehicle there is no telling what wiring may have been 
added or removed. The only way to tell which is positive is to look at 
where the wires go or to climb inside and get a close look at the 
labeling on the battery itself. Do NOT rely on wire color or position 
or wire count; these factors are too easily changed over the years.


The negative terminal connects to a short lead that is bolted to the 
body just ahead of the battery. This will be hard to see with the FI 
system in place.

The positive lead runs forward to the front of the engine and goes 
through the engine tin to bolt to the starter.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
