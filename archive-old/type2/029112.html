Subject: Brake lights and rear flasher problem

Wondering if anyone can help.
My brake lights and rear flasher lights do not work.
All fuses are good (16 amp in #1 and #10, 8 amp in all others).
Put in a new old flasher relay cause the last one had one of the two
contacts arms broken inside.
This one seems ok (no rateling noise inside).
Front flashers works fine.
Backup lights works fine.
Dash signal light shows only once and then goes out when activating
flashers.
Red knob light of emergency lights works but not the four flashers (front or
rear).

Thanks for your help.
