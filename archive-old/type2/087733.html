The idea is to keep topping up your reservoir as you bleed, never
letting it get empty or even down close to empty, doing the final
topping up after you've bled and closed the valve at the last wheel. The
only way you'd have to worry about air getting back into the lines, and
therefore having to rebleed everything all over again, is if you let the
reservoir empty at any time during the bleeding process.
