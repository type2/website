We had the same problem with the fuel pump in our '81 Westy. Came on
with the ignition. If I remeber correctly, this was the fix (it was a
few years ago). It's in the air flow sensor, the part that has the
wiper across a circuit board. When the wiper is at the rest position
(no air flow) it should close a circuit. On our meter, the little
piece of metal that accomlished this had dissapeared. The fix was to
strip a small piece of solid copper wire. Flatten it with a hammer.
Cut it to the correct length. Solder it onto the wiper. I'm not at
home now, I am on an extended stay in Philly, helping out my parents.
So I can't just go out back and stick my head in the engine to give
you a more precise description. Hope this helps!

Lisa
