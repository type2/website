Hello!
	My name is Scott and I have 1982 Westfalia diesel for sale!!! &quot;Scooby&quot;
as I refer to him, is in good shape. Exterior is in excellent condition
(with the exception of a couple of dents in the side door). Interior is
also in great shape - everything works and looks nice. Camper canvas is
in excellent condition and was water protected last year. Has new set of
50,000 mile tires. Engine is in fair shape, will need a little head work
in the future. 
	I just relocated to the Atlanta area, and unfortunately will not be
able to utilize Scooby to his intended potential. Scooby is now for sale
for $5,000. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
Thanks,
Scott
