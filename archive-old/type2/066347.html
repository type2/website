&gt;Hey All:
&gt;
&gt;I just checked out a '72 (Deluxe?) van that was converted when new to a camper
&gt;by Contempo Camper somewhere in CA. It has a double bunk upstairs, but this
&gt;isn't a pop-top. It has a permanent fiberglas shell that adds about 32&quot; to the
&gt;height of the van (the only really negative thing about this van).

I thought that too when I first laid eyes on Bluto (my '73 hightop) but now
I am really glad I got it instead of a poptop.  It has more (badly needed)
storage than a pop top, you can ALWAYS stand up in it, setting up camp is
faster (and you can sleep in rest stops without it being obvious), and it's
more weather resistant (no canvas to tear or leak).  Of course, there are
some disadvantages too, but I've learned to live with them and I think the
benefits far outweigh them.  The biggest problem is it keeps the bus from
fitting into most garages.  I haven't noticed that it is any worse in the
wind than a poptop Westy, and it still gets good gas mileage.  One other
benefit - you don't see them on the street everyday.  The camper you're
looking at has got to be pretty rare.  I hope you'll consider keeping it as
is instead of stripping it if you decide to buy it.  :/
