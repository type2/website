Howdy!

    I crunched the right rear corner on my 74. Not such a bad thing
actually, since now it runs much better (cut off a bit of the exhaust
flow, so It looks like a rebuild in my near future...) and it showed me
exactly how thing the metal was around the battery tray (think tinfoil).

    Now for getting to the point:
    When I do it, I am debating on whether to replace both quarters with
68-71 quarters (I like the small tail lights) or just do the one and
keep the &quot;New&quot; style.

Does anyone know any reasons that I should NOT use the old style (other
than not &quot;butchering&quot; an almost perfect body (the bus, not me....))?

If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of
servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go
home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms.
Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains
set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our
countrymen. -- Samuel Adams, speech at the Philadelphia
State House, August 1, 1776.
