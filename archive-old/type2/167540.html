&gt; &gt; per VW I didn't use em, but now folks are suggesting putting them in,
&gt; &gt; since I have some gaskets here that shouldn't be a problem giving it a

&gt;
&gt; I think just because people are using them doesn't mean it's the right
&gt; way to go.

no but at this stage of the game if it solves the problem....

&gt;  Keep at it and figure out the real problem.  If there's a
&gt; head-seating problem, use some valve grinding compound on the cylinder
&gt; and mate it to the head properly.  There's a good overview of how to do
&gt; this in the muir manual.  If you need more instruction on the technique,
&gt; let me know.  I just bought new heads and my mechanic said I didn't need
&gt; to do this because all the heads are machined perfectly, but I still did
&gt; it because it really makes for a perfect match between the cylinder and
&gt; head.

that involves taking the cyl off I will put the old head back on before I
do that.   This is a 20k fix, the engine has 100k + already on the engine
so I had planned a rebuild soon, just have some house bills so don't have
the money right now or would do it now and be done with it....

&gt; Also, depending on the model of your compression tester, you might be
&gt; able to use it to do a leakdown test of sorts, without all the gauges

nah mine won't do that and haven't figured a way to do it.

&gt; and stuff (which really doesn't matter - you know there's a leak).  But,
&gt; the point here is to find out exactly where.  If you have one that has a
&gt; quick-disconnect, you can connect that to an air hose and apply pressure
&gt; to your cylinder and find out exactly what's leaking.  Be very careful,
&gt; though, if your cylinder is near TDC because it can spin the engine.
&gt; Anyways, apply pressure, and listen for the leak at all the various
&gt; spots (exhaust, intake, breather, etc).  You'll probably hear more than
&gt; you heard while trying to crank over the engine.

I am going to put gasket in, put head on and see if it holds presure, if
not going to stick the old head back on.  this is a daily driver and it
has been too long off the road now. my wife wants her car back....

better is the enemy of &quot;good enough&quot; and at this stage, &quot;good enough&quot; is
good enough.

thanks
Bob
