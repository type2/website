Subject: Re: [T2] RE: PopTop Seal--Prices!!


I have seen the exact seal material that is being sold by everyone these
days listed in a McMaster Car catalog. Im not sure on the spelling here
though. This company only sells to businesses and is a wholesaler. I have a
few friends who order different materials for building racing sailboats and
this company sells everything you can imagine. They have a webpage that is
great, I just heard abouth them this weekend and have not looked up the
url. I did not see their price per foot for this seal material, but I bet
this is where all of the retailers are buying the stuff. You can get it
with aluminum, steel, or even stainless clips.

Boy! Was I off on the price for the Black Pinch on rubber, metal enforced,
and,-with the crush rubber seal!   It fit on to my Puck pop-top, Perfect,
and I am sure it would work for your pop-top camper--The cost was $12.00
for
16 feet of it!!! If anyone wants any I will get it for you--just let me
know
the length--I can bring to Pomona,  Or if you really need it I will ship
for
shipping costs! This is Not Junk!! It is Automotive Quality--On Monday I
will go to the place and check on the door rubber--I think it only comes in
Black  stay tuned--TWWM, uj
