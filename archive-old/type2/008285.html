&gt;We're contemplating converting our new '72 Bus into a camper.  We have 
a
&gt;line on a '75 Westy that we can part out.  Installing the interior 
should
&gt;not be that difficult, but what about the pop top?  I obviously will 
have
&gt;to hack out a gaping hole in the roof of our '72, but are there any
&gt;reinforcements needed?  Did they reinforce the bodies or frames at all 
when
&gt;making the Westies?
&gt;
&gt;I'm also assuming that a '75 pop top (hinge in the back) will fit a '72
&gt;Bus, which would have had a front hinging top.  Is that correct?
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone out there done this sort of conversion before?  Any tips or
&gt;suggestions?


Hey Dave,

I'm going with the majority so far and saying don't do it.  I have a '69 
Kombi I have restored to near perfect mechanical condition and I had 
planned on installing a complete &quot;79 Westy deluxe interior and top. I 
purchased the '79 and stripped it clean including the top.  The 
fiberglass part sits on the '69 perfectly, but when I started looking at 
transferring the metal frame I decided it was much more extensive than I 
had anticipated.  The '79 is open from the front rear door pillars all 
the way to the back of the bus.  There are braces that go from side to 
side and these must be kept or the bus would lose too much structural 
strength. The top bunk also sits directly on these frames.  I originally 
planned to cut the top out of the '69 and leave about 3&quot; of lip all the 
way around the interior part of the rain gutters.  I then planned to cut 
the top out of the '79 and cut it all the way to the rain gutters.  My 
next step was going to simply sit the '79 top onto the '69 and expect it 
to fit much like stacking two soup bowls on top of each other.  I have 
worked in a body shop and I think I could have made this work, but the 
glaring problem was the back hatch.  I can't convince myself the back 
hatch brackets will switch over properly with the top. However, it is 
imperative that they do stay with the top.  Even if they would switch, 
adjusting them to open and close properly would be a nightmare. I have a 
'79 Westy with nothing but a huge opening in the top and for the life of 
me I can't see a simplier way of doing it.  Just cutting a hole in the 
top of the '72 and putting the fiberglass top on will not work for a 
variety of reasons.  If you still plan on doing this you really need to 
look at a '74 or later Westy with the fiberglass top removed.  To do it 
right it is imperative that you switch all the metal frame over and that 
would be one big job.

Good luck,

Randall Gammill
