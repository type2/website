&gt; The other issue with that sender is that the case thru bolt near the sender

&gt; this out the hard way. The bolt heads must be on the 3-4 side of the case.
&gt; If the bolts are installed pointing the other direction, the tip of the bolt

Richard,

I will just add that if the motor is undisturbed this bolt problem should
not be an issue, as the bolts have the heads on the 3-4 side from the
factory, I believe. But my engine had them reversed.
