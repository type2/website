Subject: Re: [T2] 71 fuel filler

Joe at Busted Bus made me a replacement hose for my 70 bus filler hose. Here
are the details. I already emailed you the pictures.
Written on hose-  042001  GAS  EBP7(may be incomplete)
OD    2.650&quot;
ID      2.25-2.3&quot;
OAL- LONG SIDE    4.6&quot;
OAL-SHORT SIDE    3.75&quot;

Joe cut the hose so it is cut straight on one end, and at about a 20-30
degree angle on the other end. I think this is NAPA hose. Good luck and
please let me know if it works! Tom

  Subject: [T2] 71 fuel filler


Hi Folks,
    I'm may remove my fuel tank for cleaning in the next couple of
days.  Has anyone found a good product to use in place of the &quot;No
Longer Available&quot; rubber coupling that connects the fuel tank to the
filler tube?  I hesitate to disturb what I have if I can't replace it,
as it looks to be over 30 years old.
    Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.
