Hello ! What I meant with the bearing was actually more like a pilot
bearing. The actual conversion I'm into is a 1,8 Sub in a 79 passenger bus
for my wife, as you must know up here in Qquebec it's pretty cold, so I'm
plannig to put a Honda Civic heater up front and a big one under the middle
seat so my kids don't frezze up(I'm not to sure of the brand I'll install).

Anyway, as soon as i got sometime to finish it, I'll keep inform.

Best wishes!
Yannick

&gt;Do you mean in the center of the crankshaft (main bearing?!) or
&gt;something like a pilot bearing?
