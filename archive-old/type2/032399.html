does anyone have photographs/diagrams of their '75 westy interior.  my new 
bus is a '75 when my old previous bus was a '78.

i was looking for locations of fridge and rear table.  the rear table i 
have, doesn't appear to be stock and it's mounted funny (not haha, 
strange.)  i was just wonder what it was supposed to look like so i can 
start scoping for another one.

also, did these year come with the storage compartment mounted above the 
rear sleeping area (under poptop mattress at rear.)?

update the bus has been moved!

fyi, against my better judgement, the bus was driven from northern md to 
northern va on saturday night.  invalid plates and all.  i expressed my 
fuel line concerns to my boyfriend and he didn't &quot;see&quot; any problems.  so, i 
had him drive it while i followed.  (this was after 3 hours of dead 
battery, carburetor, fuel and icy gravel driveway problems.)  so, we got it 
up the icy hill with the assistance of chains and drove it to the gas 
station.  another bad judgement call....filling up the tank while running 
the bus.._dot_dead battery, remember.  then, we are off.  2 blocks from the 
house it dies.  it gets jumped my the boyfriend's pop and now it is in the 
driveway.  somehow, later that night, i misplace the only key (bad day!!) 
which is found sunday after i started frantically fixing my next 
problem..._dot_can you guess?!  that's right, the bloody bus was leaking fuel 
the entire time, and i now have a pool of gasoline in my boyfriend's 
parents driveway!  kitty litter to the rescue.  the line from the tank to 
the fuel filter was cracked.

i will NEVER, EVER let someone talk me out of my gut instinct again.  i 
could have killed my boyfriend and my new toy!

now, i am replace all of those lines.  thanks for all of the mice/drive 
advise.  i promise to use all of it next time.

missy:)
