Subject: Re: propane furnace option

Hey! You just answered a *bunch* of questions I had after a junkyard
foray yesterday! We saw a bus with an unusual camper conversion, and a
big exterior vent that said Coleman on it on the side behind the
driver's door. Much head-scratching ensued. Safe to assume it's a
Riviera with a Coleman? Steve, you need that exterior vent?

&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like a Coleman.  I have one in my Riviera.  If you remove the grill is
&gt; there a 12/120v switch on the l/h side?  Is the exterior vent about 6x9?  If
&gt; so, that's a Coleman.  If you'd like, I think that I've got a pic showing the
&gt; vent that I can send to you.
&gt; 
&gt; The bad news is that Coleman is no longer in the RV business so there is no
&gt; parts or service available.
&gt; 
&gt; Mine bit the dust when I neglected to switch over to 12v and fired it off.
&gt; Melted most of the insulation off the wiring.  I now have a 10,000 btu
&gt; hydro-flame unit to replace it with.
&gt; 
&gt; To test it, all you need is a propane tank with regulator (like for a
&gt; barbeque) and a 12v supply.Should be a piece of cake.
