Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters (I'm all ears)

I use a piece of heater hose and put it on the outside of the valve cover
above each rocker arm.  By going down the cover, you should be able to tell
which one is the noisy one.

But what you will find out is, as you replace the noisy one, the next
nosiest sounds loud, so you'll want to replace it and so on.  Better to just
replace them all at once, after all, if one went bad, the others are soon to
follow.

&gt; Hello Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in the process of adjusting the lifters on my 2.0L also. I&quot;m
&gt; keeping it simple and just Boston's directions. The only thing I can't
&gt; figure out is which one is tapping. I even took the rocker cover off and
&gt; looked and listened, while dodging spittles off oil. It sure was cool to
&gt; see them babies working.
&gt; 
&gt; So according to Bob I ran her a couple for a couple weeks, started
&gt; for 30 seconds and listened and I couldn't tell exactly where the noise was
&gt; coming from. Do I need a stethscope? Any suggestions?
