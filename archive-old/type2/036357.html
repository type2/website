Subject: turn signal?

  Hello,
       Just a quick question,I have a 72 Westy and my turn signal switch is
begining to break..I heard on the list that the turn signals are 72
specific..is this true? If so why? I replaced the turn signal before and i
remember there being 2 extra gray wires that i couldnt find a place for, so
i cut them short..It has worked fine since, but now its begining to not
work. I the plastic is breaking and i dont have right signals. I have a
source for these turn signals but not off any 72's i already scored that
one.  So i'm just wondering if any year would work, dont know why it wouldnt
but i just figured i would ask the list before i go parts scrambling
TIA
