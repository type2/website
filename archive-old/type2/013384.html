Hello Volks!

I am a new member of the list and have just recently
purchased a '69 Westy Hardtop in need of plenty of
TLC.

Now as I bought my rig for camping as opposed to it's
collectability, I'm looking to make some improvements
on the original design.  (Purists may hit &quot;DELETE&quot;
now.)

One of the many things I'd like to do is improve the
braking.  As someone once said, &quot;A bus that won't go,
can't kill you.  A bus that can't stop, can.&quot;  or
words to that effect.  Thumbing through the June 2001
issue of &quot;dunebuggy's and Hot Something-or-other's&quot; I
noticed many ads for disc brake conversions.  I said
to myself &quot;Self, how about 4 wheel disc brakes on the
Ol' Girl?&quot;  But much to my dismay, all I could find
were kits for Bugs and Sand Cars, and most without
provisions for E-Brakes.

After a look in the library and a search of the
archives, I am left with a number of questions:

Does anyone make a four wheel disc brake conversion
for the bus?

Can a bug conversion kit be used?

What about a competition kit?  (one manufacturer
claims that their product will stop a Drag car from
150 mph, but will it stop a bus from 75 mph?)

If I can use a bug kit, will it fit bus 14&quot; rims? or
can I use bug 15&quot; rims and adjust tire size
accordingly?

Do I really want four wheel disc brakes, or should I
leave the rear brakes drum?

Any advice and counsel is appreciated...

Arch
