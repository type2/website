Subject: Re: [T2] Torsion Bar Adjustment

 &gt;Here's the URL to the Craftsman one - you'll have a

&gt;helluva time with the link, so anyway, they call it
&gt;the Craftsman 39840 Magnetic Universal Protractor at
&gt;Sears_dot_com It's $10 but after you've done it without
&gt;one of these, you'll set it's value at a hundred bucks
&gt;easily. 

no beef with BaH but I followed GeorgeL's suggestion and got a 99 cent dimestore protractor with a weighted string hanging from the hole--it's more accurate than the Craftsman.

But it's sometimes better to start with where you're at, and make minute guesstimated adjustments (maybe 2-3 splines each way), than to try to go to the factory spec on a 35 yr old bus.  mark the unweighted angle of the spring plate before and after your adjustment before you put it all back together, just to make sure you're where you want to be, and for future reference.  It sucks to do this job more than twice.
