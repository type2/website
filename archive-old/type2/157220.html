Subject: Re: [T2] Turbo Bus update

David - Did you leave all the sheetmetal in the engine
compartment that butts up to the engine tin (gasket)
on stock motor? I cut it back to the frame rails and
it's amazing how much space it opens up. I feel that
it allows enough airflow around the engine that simply
by adding a couple pieces of mud-flap type material in
key spots, easily enough air for cooling can be
&quot;ducted&quot; to the radiator.

I would add some full splash guards inboard of the
reaf wheels and probably some side skirting and
there's just no way there isn't gonna be enough
airflow.

That said, I chickened out and added a front mount
radiator cuz I simply did not have enough time for R&amp;D
for the rear mount. The Aussies are using radiators
mounted underneath successfully.

If interested in my setup, see my conversion album -
