Subject: looking to buy a westy...

hello all,

i found this list in my research and i am thankful for
this forum. i am looking to buy a westfalia camper,
vanagon style because i like the roominess and the
swiveling front seats and how all the equipment is
behind the driver's seat. i am wondering about a few
things, and i hope someone could guide me in the right
direction. 
1) i'm wondering whether it is better to get a
water-cooled or an air-cooled engine. i owned a 1970
poptop some years back and did all the maintenance and
work on it, and i like that i could do my own repairs
and maintenance. seems like it might be easier on an
air-cooled engine, but i don't know... if someone
might tell me the pros and cons of each...
2) what is the life-span of a rebuild in both these
cases? is it better to find a good one with a blown
engine and do the rebuild...?
3) what is a good source for rebuilt engines, in terms
of reliability/price? i am in the san francisco bay
area but i also noticed on the web the bus depot in PA
and they would ship me a longblock rebuild and all for
$1300 or so...
4) i have the opportunity to buy a 1981 deluxe westy
with no compression on #1 cylinder and am thinking
about going this route and getting a rebuilt engine. i
was originally inclined to get a water-cooled but with
this opportunity i am re-thinking this...

i sure would appreciate some feedback on this issue,
in this time... thanks.
peace,
jeff

oh, one last thing -- i spoke with someone about
installing a brand new jetta engine in the westy---
any opinions?
