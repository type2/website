&gt; &gt;1) Can a 2.0L be setup to run well with dual carbs (if so, any suggestions

&gt; &gt;wiring FI into a bus that has never had it before does not sound like much
&gt; &gt;fun.  How tough will it be to convert an FI engine over for use with carbs?
&gt; &gt;What do I need to look out for?
&gt; 
&gt; Dual Dell 36mm DRLA carbs work fine. I ran these on my 2.0 Type 4 powered 
&gt; Beetle. Beware of dual carb cost though. You will not be money ahead to got 
&gt; with carbs versus collecting this bits and pieces to return to fuel 
&gt; injection. You can often find a whole FI harness and misc parts for trades 

I have to agree, I had an older VW (not bus) with dual carbs and it was a
royal PITA to tune and keep running right.   the FI is &quot;different&quot; so it
takes thinking a little differently but once adjusted right it is almost
maintenence free and certainly trouble free, and it will start and run in
cold wet weather without problems, the biggest problem with a non FI bus
is the need to get a FI fuel tank, but you will get one of those with the
bus you are pulling the engine from.

&gt; I like the carbs. They have a nice gee-whiz factor BUT they do not like 
&gt; cold wet weather. It takes a while to warm them up so that the car will idle.

you can say that again
