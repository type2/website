Subject: [T2] red &quot;B&quot; light on a '72

That little round &quot;B&quot; light on my dash is acting up. Though I am not sure if
it's just a short or if there's something really wrong with my bus.  Regardless,
I would really like to know what the heck this light is for... please? Anyone?

thanks,
ian - '72 Kombi

To me, it's always a good idea to always
carry two sacks of something when you
walk around. That way, if anybody says,
&quot;Hey, can you give me a hand?,&quot; you can
say, &quot;Sorry, got these sacks.&quot;
