Subject: Yakima Rack mod for Westie

I modified my Yakima q towers from my 86 JETTA GLI and put them on my 74   
Westie with no drilling and I can still pop my Top.
 Here is what I did,  I didn't have the money to buy new racks or poles   
for my bus but I did have racks on my Jetta that I wasn't using.  SO I   
Pushed my Q towers all the way out on the poles and adjusted the hold   
down clamps all the way out.  Next I went to a local Yakima dealer and   
asked if they had longer  clamps so I could hook them to my Pop Top.   
 They said they didn't.  So I looked around the shop and found the   
longest clamps they had which were for the old Y towers series.  They   
were used and I bought them and took them home and drilled a hole in the   
uppermost part of the clamp and then I drilled a hole in the lower most   
part of my Q clamps and bolted them together.  Everything has to be   
adjusted all the way out for it to work.
Now I have a rack system that clamps anywhere on the popup allowing me to   
pop the top eny time and It locks in place.   I can also take the bolts   
out and mount the racks back on my Jetta!    I have even put my Yakima   
faring on the front and it looks really cool.   Might even put some Hella   
rally lights on the rack and I would be ready for the Baja.     Later
