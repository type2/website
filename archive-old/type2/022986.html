Sorry for the misinformation - I was not considering Vanagons when I wrote 
my reply, just baywindow busses.  I'm glad to hear that the design was 
improved in the Vanagons.

&gt; &gt; I don't understand your question.  Are you talking about a type4-powered
&gt; &gt; bus?  A type 4 car (hopefully not since this is a bus list)?  The bus
&gt; &gt; installation has no idler pulley for the A/C.
