Subject: Green Vinyl Source?

This question about orange plaid has me wondering once again, has anyone
seen even a good/fair match for the lime green vinyl used on the seat edges
and door panels of the late Westy, this would be used in the Chrome Yellow
standards, Green deluxes, and maybe some other color.   I've been meaning to
have new seat covers sewn but I need a source of vinyl that at least comes
near the door panels.  I've looked at most local shops in 100's of books of
vinyl and guess what 70's lime green ain't in no more.  Found a remnant
locally but it is really too many shades off.
