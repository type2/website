Subject: Re: [T2] My Kid's New 74 Bus 

You want to be sure it can steer and stop and not catch fire. Not doing 
those three have killed people. All the rest is less important.....not 
unimportant, just less important.

Specifically.....The steering box on the front axle may be corroded 
internally, and/or cracked. If it fails suddenly, the bus becomes far less 
controllable....somewhere between bad and terrible. And if it happens at 
highway speed and you miss a curve, or it pops when you are turning a sharp 
corner and you hit someone.....you made a big mistake not making sure it 
was OK. A considerable number of totalled buses are in junk yards today 
because the steering box failed at the wrong time. Who knows what happened 
to the drivers? I know about one of them. Mine failed on my 76 Westy about 
15 years ago, and I lived through it and got it to a welder, who put on a 
new steering box. I later replaced the entire front axle, which went the 
way of the steering box. But that is another story. Don't let it become 
your story.

And really go all the way to get the brakes done by a reliable and 
experienced mechanic, if you are not one yourself. I really don't feel 
comfortable suggesting that your son learn about fixing old brakes systems 
by experimenting on his newly acquired bus. It needs to be right as soon a 
s he drives it around the block. For sure. The whole system....lines, 
cylinders, MC, shoes, drums, emergency brake. He can learn how to keep it 
that way.

There is lots of time to do all that other stuff. Listen to the guys who 
tell you about replacing the fuel lines and avoiding bus fires. And carry 
the big fire extinguisher, and ask your local fire chief which kind to buy 
for automobile fires. He probably gets called to a few every week. Don't 
let your bus burn.

Those are my suggestions. Ten would take to many pages.

 &gt; My son bought a 74 Bus off of e-bay. He has been driving it for about a 
week. Apart from some backfiring when it first starts up and cosmetics, its 
appears to be in good running order. It came with new carbs, new tires and 
a year old battery.
 &gt;
 &gt; Immediate needs to buy or schnore are a passenger side rear view mirror, 
a rim for the spare tire, and an antenna.
 &gt;
 &gt; He says he is going to restore it, which will be cool if he does. I was
 &gt; wondering what you guys would recommend as the top ten list of things to
 &gt; check out and make sure are in working order for an old bus like this.
