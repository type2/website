Subject: Engine rebuild progress

I've done quite a bit of tinkering on my buses but an engine rebuild is way
out of my league. I (think) I know what my limits are. So I was very pleased
to find a bus hobbyist who happens to be a professional engine rebuilder and
that only 40 miles from where I live. Today I took the entire engine of my
'77 Westy (a tired 1600 cc upright) to his workshop. We tore down the thing
together so I now have more of an idea what all the pictures in Muir's book
actually are trying to tell me.

This engine did get new (unleaded) heads about 20 KK (thousand kilometers)
ago but nothing else. Last year I had a compression test done. It still had
(just) acceptable compression but a lot of blow-by on all cylinders. So now
it will get all new bearings, pistons, the lot. We pulled the left side head
and it turned out OK so both heads can probably be re-used. That will save
some money. My part in it is just getting the tin powder-coated and some
other chores.

What was surprising to see was that the underside of the oil filler thingy
was rusted thru. That explained the greasy mess on the right side of the
engine. Also some pieces of what used to be a previous engine seal were
lodged between the ribs of a cylinder. And of course the thermostat was bust
(no big deal as it defaults to open).

Now I can pull the gas tank and inspect it, replace all fuel lines, and weld
in a new battery tray. No big hurry as I do not need it back on the road
before spring 2001.

I'll have some questions soon. Signing off for today.

(Still pissed off they stole my Eurovan, had to use the '69 Clipper to pull
my little trailer with the engine on it. I don't want this filthy thing
inside my bus !).
