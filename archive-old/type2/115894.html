First, thanks for the detailed reply.

&gt; If you look at the original seal, it does not have an insulation bulb
&gt; like the aftermarket poptop seals have. It has a small lip off of one
&gt; edge and that's it.

Two actually...

...and I think this picture really illustrates how the vinyl replacement
with no bulb just doesn't make contact in enough against the body like the
original seal as the westfalia factory mounted the luggage rack.

&gt; There is another solution. I do also sell a version of the luggage rack
&gt; seal that HAS the insulation bulb - my part number LUGSEAL2.  If you're
&gt; uninclined to try a bulbless seal, or if you try one and get wind noise,
&gt; order that one instead. I would second Richard's suggestion that you cut
&gt; a few holes in the bulb toward the rear of each side of the luggage rack
&gt; to allow drainage.

Is the bulb in the same unique location as the rear seal?
