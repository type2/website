Subject: Re: [T2] Altimeters...

&gt;Just then I passed a sign that read something like &quot;Red Mountain 
&gt;Pass, Elev 11,000 feet.&quot; Man, that's an altitude airplanes fly at!  
&gt;An altimeter (or an oxygen mask) would have been useful.  Good 
&gt;thing I wasn't driving the bus...

I don't know what you guys are talking about.  I've been in Colorado for
more than 3 years now and I've driven my 73 Westy over many many mountain
passes.  Eisenhower tunnel on I-70 where it crosses the divide is 11,158
feet and my old bus pulls up that thing (uphill all the way from Denver)
like a demon and rips down the other side ready for more.  I've driven it up
Mt. Evans (highest paved road in N. America at 14,168 ft) and it ran like a
champ the whole way up and back.  I've been over countless other 10,000+
foot passes and have never had a lick of trouble.  And anyone whose ever
ridden with me can testify that I'm not babying my bus while doing this!  I
keep up with SUV and passenger cars and am constantly passing the more timid
drivers.  This is in a 73 Westy with a bone-stock 914 2.0 motor with d-jet
FI and a 5 speed 901 tranny.
