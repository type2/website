Subject: RE: [T2] What is best program to make a website?

By far the best program to make a website is VI (someone out there can back
me on this one) ^_^

We use a Content Management System over at Aircooledaddiction_dot_com called
PHP-Nuke. It's modular and meant for communities but you have to know some
PHP if you want to hack and change it a bit...
