My first experience with VW engine combustibility came within hours of my wife
buying her first bus. Having replaced an expensive FI component and finally
getting the beast to run, before I could make any adjustments, a bad spark
plug wire arc-ed and ignited the gas and oil soaked factory VW cloth covered
fuel and vacuum hoses. After that, I don't know what kept the fire going so
well, but it took 2 fire extinguishers, and a desperate garden hose to save
that puppy. No fire engine was going to get even close where she was parked.
Bus was saved, many happy miles were ultimately logged. My suggestion, beside
inspections and good hoses. Get rid of the cloth covered lines and keep the
engine compartment Clean! Just one man's
opinion!.........................Johnny
