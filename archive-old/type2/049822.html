Subject: [T2] NY listees - OBO 78 bus

NY Listees,

I have been kicked out of my place and have to get rid of a 78 bus - decent 
shape no motor, auto trans, heater plus parts

I don't want to junk it - I got a free T1 motor - but the case is FI with no 
re mounts so I can't put it in the bus

Does anybody have an interest?  I don't want to part it out as I don't have 
time to buikd another engine or look for another place to store it.

pics at cyberbeetle_dot_com under my cars so you know what it looks like.

thanks
