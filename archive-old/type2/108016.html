Subject: Anyone using Thule artificial gutters on a pop top?

I'm going to install a Thule roof rack on my pop top. I wanted something to go
on the pop top itself, so I don't have to take bars off in order to pop the
top. I have all the hardware (I am missing a couple bolts from artificial
gutters) and rack components to bolt the rack to artificial gutters on the pop
top. What I'd like to see are some pictures of how other people with
artificial gutters have them mounted. I need a close-up to see how the gutter
feet connect- I have the general idea, but want to see it.

Any other tips/tricks I should follow before I do this?
I know, it isn't good to put weight on fiberglass, but I have two high end
bikes that weigh less than 50lbs, or a canoe which weighs about the same, so
there isn't a lot of weight.

Thanks for the pics and tips,

Nik
