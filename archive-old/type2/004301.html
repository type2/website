I am confused. How did you staple thru the plastic strip, thru the canvas,
into the wood with the canvas folded and hanging down?
Or did you cheat and staple thru the canvas, thru the plastic, thru the
canvas, into the wood? In other words, the staples are showing?
They are supposed to be hidden.

&gt; On my '74 Westy, I installed the new canvas bottom first and top last
because it did not make any sense to do it the other way as the instructions
stated.  What I ended up doing is to install the bottom part of the canvas
to the roof of the bus and then pop the top all the way and start at the
front center of the canvas (this being a late model type pop top).  To
install the top portion of canvas, I used a short piece of yardstick and
draped the canvas over, held it in place, and then pushed the yardstick up
into the corner of the roof.  This way you can change the tightness of the
canvas without having to staple, check the tightness, unstaple, adjust,
restaple, etc., etc.  I then worked from the front to the back evenly on
both sides.  This made more sense to me since 1. you can adjust as needed,
2. you don't have to staple the same place numerous times (which cannot be
good for the new canvas) and 3. you do not need to keep popping the roof up
and down.  The whole process of!
&gt; !
&gt;  installing the new canvas took about 3 hours in total.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know if I'm missing something here but this process sure made more
sense to me than installing the top first.
