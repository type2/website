Subject: Re: valve clatter?

Considering I have over 115K on my lifters, one will sometimes not pump
up (probably drained out when the little hole in the side pointed
down?)- it can take sometimes 20 minutes of driving to pump it up; helps
to get the oil thin.
   You can bleed a lifter (see Bentley) by taking it apart, reassembling
under oil in a can.  I remember you can pump the assembled piston also
under oil, pushing a bike spoke into the center to open a little ball
valve as you watch air bubbles come up.  To pull the lifter, just take
off the rocker arms on the offender, pull the pushrod, and then take out
the pushrod tube.  The lifter may come out with a good magnet (auto
shop- has a telescoping rod); I just stick a finishing nail into the
center hole, pushing sideways to trap the nail in the hole, and then
pull.
