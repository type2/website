The Parts Place will charge a $650 core charge if you don't send a 
rebuildable core when purchasing a rebuild of this vintage.  At $100-150 
it sounds like a good deal (especially with the FI stuff).  I'm 
contemplating the purchase of a similar motor (engine?) for the same 
price.  (Already bought the gas tank)

You might also price the tranny.  Mighty expensive, these are...
