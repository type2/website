Don, I guess I'm a lucky fella. Last January we bought a nice 78 Westy
in UT. We flew to NM, picked it up in UT and drove it home in 5 days
to MI. 24 years ago we did the same thing with a 61 Austin Healey 3000
from San Francisco in 9 days. Next summer, after going over the Westy
this winter, (upper end rebuild and all four corners) we're planniing
a road trip to Labrador via Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.

She's the adventurous type, always ready to go and a great navigator.
I've found that she's more comfortable with long road trips if there's
plenty of planning and contingency stuff like AIRS, spares, a cell
phone, AAA and a credit card. An occasional night in a motel and a
stop now and then for bargain underwear at the outlets doesn't hurt
either. We try to make the camper as clutter free and comfortable as
we can. She's learned how to s___ in the woods and take cool showers
behind a blue tarp. Teamwork and planning together our many road trips
over the years we've learned that it's always best to be a team

I'm getting ready to install the Koni shocks, if it stops raining.
Lessee...  Honey? Where's the PB Blaster?

Rick
