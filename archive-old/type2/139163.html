&gt; Hello,
&gt; Please help me understand brake calipers.

Ok,
I will try. This is a complicated topic. I sell parts and I still am a
teensie bit confused about this topic...
&gt; 
&gt; I ordered a right rebuilt brake caliper for 71-72 bus (part 211 615 108X)
&gt; and here is what I received:
&gt; 
&gt; Core: 1973 and later (the larger one) as pictured on Fig 7-3 page 18,
&gt; chapter 8 of Bentley.
&gt; 
&gt; Brake hose connection: would be on the upper part of the caliper with
&gt; caliper installed on the right wheel. (Sounds right)

All calipers have brake hose connection in the centre of the caliper. Surely
you are referring to the bleeder screw.

&gt; 
&gt; Pistons cutouts: both cutouts would be on the upper part of the pistons with
&gt; caliper installed on the right wheel. (Sounds not right)

This is where is gets a tad confusing. There are two details at play.
Bleeder screws and piston orientation. The 71-72 calipers all seem to have
only one bleeder screw. The bleeder screw is always on the top, caliper
installed on the vehicle, so there is a left and right caliper. And the
pistons must be oriented correctly. You also need the correct brake pad
shims, and the shims will not fit onto the caliper if the pistons are not in
the correct orientation.

All the 73-up calipers I have seen have two bleeder screws. This means that
there is really no left and right caliper, they are both the same, but the
pistons are rotated in the caliper to make it a left or right.

&gt; 
&gt; 2) Assume I eventually got a correct 1973 and later right caliper. Is it OK
&gt; to have a 1971 caliper on the left and a 1973 and later on the right ? My
&gt; left caliper is doing working properly.

I don't think so. I am not sure what you are asking. The 73-up caliper is
different from the 71. It uses different brake pads (thicker) and the
mounting screws are larger on 73-up.

I made a quickie page with some photos of bus calipers, it might explain the
differences a bit better:
