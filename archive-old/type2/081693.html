&gt; &gt; I cannot for the life of me
&gt; &gt; get any of the dang lugnuts to start loosening up. When I had this
random
&gt; &gt; shop give me an estimate a month back, they must have just gone nuts
with
&gt; &gt; the airpowered gun and they are essentially welded in place it seems.

&gt; CR, (and everyone)
&gt;
&gt; Sears sells a 24&quot; long, 1/2&quot; drive flex-head breaker bar. Last time I
&gt; bought one they were (just slightly) less than $20US.  If you leave your
&gt; driveway without one of these and a 6-point 19mm socket, you are not just
&gt; asking for trouble, you are begging real hard.
&gt;
&gt; No matter how hard they put the lug nuts on, if you stand on the end of a
&gt; 24&quot; bar, you are exerting twice your weight in foot-pounds of torque.  A
&gt; 100 pound person can exert 200 foot pounds of torque just standing still.
&gt; Bounce a bit and you can get up to 4-600 in intantaneous torques. If you
&gt; weigh 200+, as I do, you can shear off the stud!  I recommend holding on
&gt; to the drip rail as you do this as they can let go rather suddenly.
&gt;
&gt; This question (and other in the past) have gotten me thinking.  In a
&gt; desperate situation, what would be my *minimum* tool kit.  Say you were
&gt; going out in a friend's mini-cooper to rescue your bus from an unknown
&gt; breakdown. IMHO, the minimums you need to be on the road are:
&gt;
&gt; Minimum Tools:
&gt; 1/2&quot; drive flex bar
&gt; 3/8&quot; drive ratchet
&gt; sockets, 1/2&quot; drive - 17mm, 19mm (6 POINT!!!!)
&gt; sockets, 3/8&quot; drive - 6-19mm
&gt; 6&quot; long 3/8&quot; drive extension
&gt; combination wrenches - 6-19mm
&gt; phillips screwdrivers - #1 &amp; #3
&gt; flat blade screwdrives - one small (1/8&quot; blade) and one large (1/2&quot; blade)
&gt; Vice Grip - model 12LC (get the real one) and model 4LN (needle nose)
&gt; leatherman tool
&gt; multi-meter
&gt; feeler gauges
&gt;
&gt; Minimum Supplies:
&gt; quart of oil
&gt; can of Kroil
&gt; roll of duct tape
&gt; roll of electrical tape
&gt; zip-ties
&gt;
&gt; Minimum Parts:
&gt; points
&gt; condensor
&gt; fan belt
&gt;
&gt; There are lots of other things that are handy, and I travel like Lewis
&gt; Carrol's white knight, but this is the absolute minimum in my book.  Any
&gt; other opinions? What have I forgotten?  Duplicated?
&gt;
&gt; Thing I considered and rejected:
&gt;
&gt; wire terminal kit - handy, but you can wrap, tape and crip bare wire
&gt; temporarily
&gt;
&gt; wire - in an emergency, I can salvage wire from a secondary circuit
&gt;
&gt; match solder - gosh, I was tempted, but it is just not reliable enough :-(
&gt;
&gt; bulbs - one of any will get you home (one headligh, one tail light, etc.)
&gt;
&gt; hydraulic jack - this is minimal for me, but I figured I would catch a lot
&gt; of flack :-) (and the VW jack *almost* works!)
