Subject: Re: Where should I buy a rebuilt 1600 dual-port engine?

After buying a '72 bus complete with single port motor which boasted
extended crankshaft end play and spat out a poorly fitted spark plug.
I felt that a nice shiny replacement was due. 

I invested in a reconditioned unit from the Dutch company VEGE,
also known as 'fit and forget'. 

It cost 150% more than the competition but the overall feeling
from this mailing list is that if you want the best, you pay 
that bit more.

Regards Simon.
