Subject: RE: [T2] Shocks for Van = Shocks for Bay?

I wonder if it might just be a difference in the bushing size.

Thanks,

&gt;From: &quot;The Bus Depot&quot;

&gt;While I haven't tried it myself, I'd be very surprised if they could be
&gt;interchanged. They are completely different part numbers, both from VW
&gt;and in the aftermarket. Even the aftermarket shock manufacturers (i.e.
&gt;KYB), who are usually quite adept at making one shock fit as many
&gt;applications as possible (so they can produce fewer SKU's), list a
&gt;totally different shock for the Bus vs. the Vanagon.
