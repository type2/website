Subject: Re: dial indicator

I just received Kymco's &quot;end play measuring tool&quot; which consists of a
magnetic base, a dial indicator, and instructions. Made in China, $45
+ shipping.

Quality looks fine so far, but then again, I have no reference and
haven't actually used it. Precision is 0.001&quot;, essentially the same as
that of generic feeler blade gauges.

Valve lift can be measured by unscrewing the magnetic bloc and
replacing it with a 1&quot; long 8mm nut. The other end of the nut is then
screwed onto a rocker arm stud. This solves the problem of finding a
good place to put the magnetic bloc on aluminum heads.
