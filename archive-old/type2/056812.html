Hello, I got this email to my web site today and figured the list has a
better chance of helping him than I do:

==========================================
&gt;From mechanic_at_kdsi_dot_net
I am a mechanic at an independent repair facility in Grand Island
Nebraska. The intake valve in number three cylinder has receeded into the
head. ?????
I understand that this is kind of normal for the air cooled VW (I profess
little expreteise in the VW line, I am a Honda fanatic) My question is:
What caused this in the first place?  I don't want to fix the valve and
have a problem left unresolved to plague them again in a few hundred or a
few thousand miles. Can you steer me in the right direction??

==========================================


Please respond to him

Thank you,
Everett Barnes
