Hi Niall:

&gt;From: &quot;Niall Sweeny&quot; &lt;niall_at_cyberarts_dot_com&gt;
the time has come for me to tackle
&gt;my own rebuild job.
&gt;
&gt;Here are my requirements (or wishes - depends on what is achievable):
&gt;* I would like a little more power - enough to get me through the &gt;mountain 
&gt;passes without lagging uncomfortably behind traffic (this &gt;scares my wife 
&gt;too much) - we're talking 50-55 on most grades without &gt;overheating.
&gt;* I want reliability and maintainability - read FI, hydraulic, engine &gt;that 
&gt;lasts 100,000 miles with good maintenance

You need a watercooled FI Golf/Jetta (Vanagon) conversion for this type of 
power. Obtaining power for 55+m/hr on heavy mtn grades with a 2.0L bus 
engine that has to meet pollution mandates is wishful thinking (IMHO).

If you dont have to pass pollution regulations then you could build a 
&quot;stoker&quot; 2.0L but it really sounds like you want to much from a bus. Upgrade 
to a vanagon and you can have those things (unless you can figure out how to 
put a radiator in the front of a bus). Just my opinion. I'm sure others will 
disagree.

Try www.tiico_dot_com for a taste.

In time I might convert my 80 Westy Vanagon (aircooled) to this Tiico 
conversion.
