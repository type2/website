Subject: Re: Coil-over rear shocks

Hello List:
I don't ever recall a shock mount problem, with coil overs, that was 
installed correctly,
and not totally abused.
I've took note of them since I first started work for Volkswagen, Porsche, 
Audi, in1967.

Note: I came across something quit different yesterday when I pulled an 
AB-case
engine apart: Dual oil pressure relief valves, 200 mm flywheel, &quot;Dog House,&quot; 
cooler,
set up, 69mm crank, &quot;DOME&quot; 76.95 Pistons &amp; Cylinders, Dual port Heads, 
manifolds etc.
Needless to say quit a sight to see.
Will start rebuild after &quot;T&quot; day, on Monday.
Started research, and have some feed back, but am wondering if anyone else 
&quot;Out there&quot; &quot;The List&quot;- has came across this one before...
Regards BOB &amp; Martha in Crescent City, Calif.
