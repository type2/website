&gt;&gt;    Ok so I have two questions.  The first one is:  What is the sensor 
&gt;&gt; that mounts near the back of the flywheel?  What does it do, and what 
&gt;&gt; happens when it hits the two little studs it's supposed to sense?
&gt; 
&gt;  It doesn't hit those two studs, it just senses magnetically when
&gt; they go by.  

Yeah, It's not supposed to hit the studs, but mine does.  Or did, anyway. 
It has a nice gouge in it from them.  I took it out because it was loose,
and I replaced it 180 degrees out, so it would stay in the hole.  But I 
guess it doesn't matter, because it does nothing.  I wish I knew that 
before I put the engine back in.  Ahh well....

	Thanks....
