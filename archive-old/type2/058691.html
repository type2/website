&gt;I would call Mark Stephens on it.  I just talked to them last week and they

The only thing I worry about is sending it to them and waiting
a month to get it back, plus shipping would prob. cost as much as
the job would around here. 

&gt;up a pair of heads from them - I think I'm gonna go pull the valves and
&gt;make sure mine match the seats.  :-/

I was amazed when I found it. I had actually started to lap one in,
and was not getting anywhere. Then I noticed that there was a groove
worn all the way around the valve from the edge of the seat. 
That was not cool. I will need a new valve, too.

It was funny because the valve seats had indicator solution on them,
like they were checking for a good fit, but  the angles
are obviously not right. It was an edge seal, telling me that the 
seats are very circular, no runout, but that edge would get burned
in no time in a hot engine. I am going to go over it one more time to make
sure I did not mix up the valves from where they came, but I have
them marked really well.

&gt;BTW, I let MSHP talk me into taking heads with inserts in the spark plug
&gt;holes.  I was not happy about it at first, but the guy swore that they send
&gt;these &quot;timeserts&quot; out in almost all of their rebuilt heads, and they have

If they are the kind with the locking pins that drive through into the 
aluminum, dont worry about them. If they back out, your head
is in worse shope and you have other things to worry about.
Some just have locking tabs that you peen in, they are OK, but
could be better. It is too hot to Red Loctite them in.

I have a cheap insert in one of my heads, and have for almost
30k miles. It has never given me trouble, but I use
anti-sieze. If you have a rebuilt head, you need inserts. 90% of
used heads have some cracking or stripping near the plugs.

&gt;crankcase pressure - I like that since I'm having a small problem with

Sound like a pair of late type III heads. They are ported for breathing.
Mine were new. I wish that they still made the type-III style heads.

Just out of curiousity, how close were the CC measurements 
out of the box?

I run a compression ratio of 6.7 average. I still have plenty
of torque and the engine never runs too hot, regardless of the
weather or how heavy traffic is. That is my stock heads, though.
I will be interested in how the bigger valves affect that.
