Subject: exhaust bolts and terminology questions.

I need to know the size of the nuts that hold the exhaust to the heads?
This is for a 2 liter '77 bus with FI.
Now for the terminolgy questions.
I believe that rocker covers are the valve covers right?  What are rocker
panels?  
What exactly is a manifold?  it it the pipes that fit from the exhaust into the
head and from the FI/Carb into the head.  Or is it something else?

'77 Westy may be running tonight after a 6 months rest.  I can't wait!!!!!
