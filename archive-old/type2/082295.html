&lt;&lt; The only disadvantage is that you sit a bit higher, about a inch. &gt;&gt;

I discovered the same thing.  It is_so_pronounced on the passenger side 
westfalia seat with the swivel mechanism that it significantly reduces your 
field of view out the front and side windows.  

After getting very frustrated with the situation during several days of 
birding at Tule and Lower Klamath Lake wildlife refuges, I have decided to 
remove both vanagon seats and hopefully replace them with the original seat 
bottoms attached to the vanagon seat backs (I like the arm rests).
