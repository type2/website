  Advice?

&gt; An even better solution would be to use your bus to deliver hot meals

&gt; that would look in court if it ever came to that!

&gt; You can stick up for your rights if you want to. You have that right.
&gt; But out-good-citizening this letter writer is better for the soul.

This is one reason why my &quot;eyesore&quot; bus with radio antennas all over it
also sports a &quot;LA County Sheriff Disaster Communications Service&quot; sticker
and is regularly used for Fire Watch patrols during fire season.

That, and I actually enjoy doing pubic service volunteer work...  :)
