Subject: Front Bumper Tag Holder/Bracket

The center heater tube is in, sealed and insulated. Looking at my A/C condenser, I can see the insulation may cause a problem, I will see.

Anyway, my Florida Tag now says &quot;1972 BUS&quot; because everyone kept asking me what year it was. My old tag &quot;OYUKI&quot;, (Oyuki means Honorable Snow in Japanese, my Bus is completely Bright White), that I have had for many years is now retired. I am going to remove the renewal stickers from it
and I want to hang it on the front. But, my Bus does not have a front license plate mount.

Since some states required front and rear tags, VOA must have had something for this.  Was there something special for this or did they just get a generic tag mount and drill holes in the bumper?
