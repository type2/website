Subject: Re: Rod knock??

Greg:

Sounds like a lifter thats not pumped up.  If it wasn't making the noise
last week when you parked it, I doubt that its rod knock.  I know it sounds
bad, but get it on the road and up to speed.  It may take 5 minutes at 55,
but it should go away.  If not, try readjusting the lifters, when the
engine is cold.  My bus has done this for 10 years.
