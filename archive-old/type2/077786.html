Subject: RE:68-73 Westy Closet/Cabinet mods.

&gt;  Adam wants to cut the top off of the closet/cupboard unit in his westy
and
shorten it down enough so that it won't block the passenger side rear
window. &lt;
&gt; Anybody seen or done this before? It seems like a good idea to me since it
avoids the expensive issue of re-upholsering the Z-bed and finding spacer
cushions for the gaps in the rear deck.  &lt;

Hi Greg,

	I decided to do this exact same conversion in my bus, but instead of
cutting down the original cabinet in my bus (which was still in pretty
decent shape), I fabricated a new shorter cabinet from 1/2&quot; Baltic Birch
plywood.  By using the old cabinet as a template (and with my dad's
carpentry skills) I was able to get the whole cabinet out of one 5'x5' sheet
with some left over for new projects.  I decided to go for access from the
top instead of the front, but it could work well either way.  You can see
how it came out here:  http://www.geocities_dot_com/vwcamper72 .  If you need
more pictures or details, let me know.

									Hope this helps.
