&gt; Been reading up on installing my cht sensor before I put the tin over

&gt; folks seem to recommend using NKG plugs so there is a little more

&gt; the
&gt; quality of NKG. Tried searching the archives for nkg and only got 10
&gt; responses. 6 of them were duplicates. Anyone out there use NKG plugs? 
&gt; Whats
&gt; your opinion? GOOD? BAD? INDIFFERENT?

I am currently using NGK B6ES in my '76 w/ FI.  I like them so far, 
though the real test will be &quot;how do they look when it's time for the 
next tune-up?&quot;.  I have heard that a fair number of folks consider them 
&quot;better than Bosch&quot;.
