Folks,

Anyone know offhand if the type IV upright conversion can be put in a 1968
Type II Campmobile?

I recently built a 1600cc DP with a weber progressive that was really strong
and smooth in that bus, but I think I have sold it. So, I just pulled a 78
2.0 liter from a donor bus, with the tranny.

The transmission looks like an easy conversion as the nose mount horns just
unbolt and swap with the 68's flat steel mount. I'm just not sure how to
hang the engine in the back.

Is there a mounting kit for this?

By the way, I am keeping the old engine and tranny on a pallette in my
garage. This bus will easily go back to stock if need be.

You can see the 68 at people.ne.mediaone_dot_net/matthew/ along with some of my
other vehicles.

Anyone try this yet???? Ed???

Thanks,
Matt
