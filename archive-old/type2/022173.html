==========================
In my '70 all of the plate retainers are studs, except for just ONE, which
is a bolt.
Leaving a nut off of one of the studs does not make oil drain.
Leaving the bolt out makes a mess.

Sounds to me like you lost the bolt.
Perhaps it should be replaced by a bolt.

I think!?
