Subject: Camper pop top available -  SF

Found today an addition to my favorite junkyard - a 72 or 73 with fully
functional westy pop top.  All the canvas is ok (fixed in parts, but
well repaired), zippers seem to work, goes up and down just fine.  A
little oil and it would be like new.  Guy at the yard wanted $50,
u-pullit.
	The yard is ABC, on Evans street in SF.  Just a thought, if anyone is
interested.
