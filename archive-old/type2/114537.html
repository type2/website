Subject: Re: [T2] How did you restore your front kick panels?

&gt;what i was going to do was use some door skins from home depot, 
&gt;they are 7$ and are of the right thickness.  i was just going to 
&gt;stain them to match my walls and door panels as i am going for 
&gt;an all wood interior for kind of a surf look on top of being 

Those luan door skins make great replacement panels, but I'd like to make 1
suggestion:  After you cut them out and sand them, but BEFORE you stain them
soak a towel in hot water and wrap it around your panel and let it sit for
30-45 minutes.  Then you can gently bend and shape the panel without
breaking it.  Fit it into place and let it dry in place before removing it.
It'll hold the shape that it dries in.  Then you can remove it and stain it.
