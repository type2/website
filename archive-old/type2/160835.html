Subject: When Bus Owners Strike Back (window Installation)

Hi,

Vacuumed all the broken glass out of my doorframe. Removed the old
lifter channel. I'm kinda stuck trying to remove the lifter mechanism.
Bently says simply &quot;Press the window front guide channel forward off
its bracket. Then through the gap thus formed pull the window lifter
assembly downward and out of the door.&quot; This sounds much easier than
it is. I'm assuming the front guide channel is the peice between the
vent window and the main window, but theres really no &quot;forward&quot; to
push this channel. If I pull on it the entire vent window assembly
vent windo included) slides back a little separating the seal from the
front of the window.

Well that's where I am. I'd really like to have eveything prepped and
ready to go when my new glass arrives. Any tips, hints, pictures? Is
there a way to install the new glass without removing the lifter
assembly? Finally, the new glass will be inserted through the hole in
the door frame and pushed upward into its track, right? This project
is looking more difficult than I first expected.

Thanks

peace
