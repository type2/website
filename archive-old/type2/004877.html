Check the vacuum booster check valve it may be faulty or you may have it
reversed.

Subject: [T2] Rich mixture/Vacuum leaks


&gt; Volks-
&gt; IF I had a small vacuum leak (without knowing about it) for the past year
&gt; or so, and actually was able to adjust my carb and idle and all that,
would
&gt; fixing that vacuum leak now make me run too rich?
&gt; Today I was replacing some pretty ratty looking vacuum hoses for/from the
&gt; brake booster and was wondering how some of them were able to create a
good
&gt; seal while I was using them. After I replaced them, my engine wants to
&gt; stall out when I initially give it gas, kinda like a flat spot, but if I
&gt; feather the gas, and it gets past that initial point, she runs fine.
What's
&gt; going on?
&gt; I have an 1800 T4 with the Webber Progressive (which I love).
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Joel
