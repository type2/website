Subject: Wires? where do they go?

Hey volks,
im gettin ready to fire lizzy up today so i am
finishing up all the little things on the engine.   me
being the moron that i am, i didnt mark a couple
wires.   there are 3 wires coming out of the firewall
on the passenger side.   one is black with a female
end on it and the other two connect to one female end
and these wires are all green and green/yellow.  
coming from the wiring harness box that is attached to
the firewall is one green wire with a male end.   i
would assume that the greens would go together?  
where does that black one go?  second question is i
cant seem to find my wire for my oil pressure sending
unit?   there just doesnt seem to be a wire anywhere
to hook it up, yet i did disconnect it when i dropped
the engine.   where does this wire originate from in
the engine compartment.  i dont have a bentley yet so
i dont have access to their wiring diagrams so any
help is appreciated.
thanks!!!!!
