Another couple of words from me.

I did not mean gauges were useless as I have a tach, oil temp, oil 
pressure, and cylinder head temp gauges. Good way to develop trends and 
normals for a particular engine - I don't put much weight into the numbers.

What I was suggesting by using the age old dipstick temp check was - does 
the temperature of the dipstick support the overtemp reported by the Berg 
dipstick light.

Next point - get a separate light (other than the oil light) for the Gene 
Berg gadget. As long as both report through the light you don't know if you 
have low oil pressure or high oil temps. Visit Radio Shack or somebody for 
another indicator light.

Lastly - are you sure that the fan you are running matches the doghouse 
tin? I think I remember that the older fans were the same diameter as the 
later model versions BUT were narrower - possibly leading to cooling 
capacity loss because the fan doesn't accurately match the tin (fit snuggly 
with proper clearances for rotation).

Is fan belt pulley slipping on the generator/alternator shaft?

Is ALL of the tin present and including the body to engine tin seal?

Hope you figure it out.
