Subject: The Rubber Conspiracy (Japan)

 This should have a better title but it's too complex to deal with.

 I had heard a rumour that the Japanese were required to replace 
engines at some 30,000 miles and the old ones are of course imported
to the USA and you'll see ads in your local papers about them.
Just Rumour.

 This story I found published so I can only assume the author checked 
for authenticity. If not we still won't know but we still have the
engines so it's a trade-off.

 The deal is: the government requires that all automobiles in Japan
replace ALL RUBBER PARTS every three years.

 Those of you who have replaced all your rubber no doubt winced at 
that one. :-)

 I saw a guy come into my flaps and order all new door seals etc.,
for a van, the bill was close to $2000.

 What about all the rubber hoses and brake lines and &quot;ad infintum&quot;?

 Now throw in the labor costs to have this done.

 As a result, if the car has too many miles, when they see the bill,
they opt for a new car. Consumerism at it's finest!

 The car is stripped. The engine and tranny are sold to the junk man.
Shipped to the US and we quickly snap them up. It may have 30k or 70k
miles on it. That is also more in line with what I've seen.

 That's what other goverments do, aren't we lucky? :-)

 From my own stockpile of info, I can tell you that no rubber manufacturer
will give you a guarantee of more than 4 years shelf-life. 

 This was found in relation to installing O-rings in Nuclear Reactors
 Supposed to last for forty years. You live near one ? How nice!


 The operative is &quot;shelf-life&quot;. If it lays on the shelf for 3 years
and you put it in your car. Well, you see the happenings here.

 Shelf-life also means at 70F temp. not 300F engine temp.

 You know those little o-rings in your carby? Them too.

 Yes they last longer but that's strictly Karma. Not a guarantee.

 I don't write this stuff to bum you out people, honest.
  Ignorance is the enemy.

 The world is perfect and we are perfect. Think of that and you'll 
 feel a lot better.  :-)

 I consider myself  practical, and that there &quot;are&quot; times when the
smell of napalm in the morning &quot;is&quot; exhilarating.  west
