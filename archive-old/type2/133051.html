Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap/Easy HP boosters? 

Chris,

Most &quot;usefull&quot; changes are going to require either a dynamometer and/or
a full scale EPA type rolling road to test for *truly* increased mileage.

The rest is all hype and conjecture...and beliefs held by some of us for 
more than 35 years.LOL!

Muffler...need dyno to figure out if it &quot;really&quot; works.
Pertronix type &quot;points replacement&quot; ...no brainer...do it.

True electronic ignition...also a no brainer.

Split fire plugs in ACVW...never...never use platinum either.

John Connaly at aircooled will swear on a stack of bibles
that SVDA distrib is a perfromance enhancing mileage improving
guarantee.

The other stuff...on your list...don't know...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Disconnect the Charcoal Canister from the intake. 
&gt; Turn the Full Throttle Valve to always on or always off, I forget witch.
&gt; 
&gt; Disconnect the EGR valve so you don't re-burn gasses.
&gt; Install Full Flow/Unbaffled muffler.
&gt; Install Electronic Ignition (i.e. pertronix)
&gt; I put split-fire plugs into my honda once. Made a big differance, do
&gt; they do much in VW engines? 
&gt; I've heard mixed reports on .009 distro's. What about Porche distro's
&gt; and/or OTHER Bosches?
&gt;  
&gt; Any other ideas/myths/theories/methods? 
&gt;  
&gt; This should be a fun thread! :)
