&quot;Anyone ever hear of a water cooled oil cooler?&quot;

 	Our Corrado has a oil-to-water cooler that uses the engine
coolant. Fits between the block and the oil filter, which
is a cartridge type, not a spin-on, for the VR6. 
	It also has a thermostat to turn on the fan that blows air
over the air/water radiator, like most modern engines, AND an electric 
pump (!) to move the coolant around after the engine is shut off.
There are probably extra sensors to activate this pump.

	Water and oil are interesting: Water boils at 100C/212F, unless
pressurized. Oil probably boils somewhere way up there but more to the
point starts to smoke and degrade at 300-350-400 (Dino 30 wieght- at a
guess the multi-vis additives probably start to get frayed below 300F)
So, wow, you can run oil hotter than you can run water, which is why
'aircooled' engines are actualy oil-cooled and the oil coolers are so
much smaller than water radiators

	You can pack a lot more calories/watts/BTUs into a given
wieght of water at a given temperature than you can pack into a similar
wieght of oil. This measurement is called specific heat. Just
to make the measurements easy, it takes 1 calorie to raise 1cc of
water 1 degree c, from 24.5 to 25.5 I believe, something like that.

	Someone with time, a calculator and a CRC handbook could work out
how much water you'd have to have and how much radiator for it,
using just thermosiphon effect to move the water, to take
10 or 20 degrees C off your engine oil temp. Presuming its at, say,
100-120 and you'd like it to be 80-100. 
	Then build it and see how well experiment agrees with practice :)

	Do a good job and you could brew tea or coffee, or cook, while you drive :)
