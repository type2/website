Subject: Re: Oil filters

&gt;Is there a requirement to remove and clean the filter screen in the bottom
&gt;of the engine everytime you change the oil and filter? I have difficulty
&gt;getting a good seal when I remove the plate and I always go through a week
&gt;of leaking oil before I get it right.  I am also always worried about
&gt;overtorqueing the 9 FtLb bolt that holds it all together.  I would rather
&gt;just change the oil and normal filter every time and clean the screw once in
&gt;a while. Comments?
&gt;
&gt;Additionally, does a rabbit filter really work better than the stock filter
&gt;as muir says?

Gary,

My understanding is that it is not necessary to remove and clean the 
filter screen on type II's that also have screw on filters. The screen 
itself has very large holes in it relative to the particles suspended in 
your oil, and is not really meant to filter oil at all.

What I've heard is that the filter screen in the sump is really just to 
create an area of less turbulence at the bottom of the oil scavenger. 
This keeps the oil from sloshing around too much and keeps a constant 
flow of oil headed into the pump.

Still, I think it's not a bad idea to remove the plate and clean it 
anyway. Reason being is that it gives you an opportunity to look at 
what's been happening in your engine. You can see if carbon granules have 
been building up, you can see small metal bits from bearing surfaces, 
etc. All these help in your diagnosing the overall health of your car. In 
addition, make sure to replace the gaskets and copper washers as well.

One word of warning though, and perhaps someone else can help me with 
explaining this better. The sump plate has a bolt that attaches up to the 
oil scavenger unit, and if overtorqued can cause the bolt hole on the 
scavenger to break. This will prevent the sump plate from seating 
properly, and you won't be able to put oil in the car without it leaking 
back out. Fixing it requires that you split the case, so it's not an easy 
problem to overcome. Torqueing to specs should prevent this from 
happening.

Apparantly this is why some oil change shops refuse to work on type II's. 
They've had to foot the bill when an overzealous oil changer didn't know 
the torque specs on the sump plate. (Any additions from someone who's 
actually had this happen, would be welcomed).

Cheers,

Bren
