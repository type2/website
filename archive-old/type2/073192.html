Subject: Re: braking/engine problems more clearly defined


&gt;When I test drove it today there was a very clear scraping noise coming from
&gt;one of the front wheels. It happens once per reveloution of the tire.

I dunno beans about late buses but if it is like every other modern
front-disc car, there is a little metal clip built into the brake shoe that
is specially designed to make an irritating noise when the shoes are close
to worn out. Hopefully that's all it is. You need to have the wheel off and
check it out, new discs are not very cheap so it matters if yours has been
scraping metal-on-metal.

On earlier buses you can do this whole job with a pipe wrench and a
screwdriver if you have to but I dunno about the late ones. Probably takes
a C-clamp and an Allen wrench besides. 8) It's the same 6mm Allen you use
for the CV joints and you can get it as an attachment for your ratchet at
Sears. You can do this.

&gt;Something else non-technical is that it just runs loud and &quot;knocky&quot;. It
&gt;doesn't purr and have that delightful VW trademark whistle that my old bug
&gt;had when I start it up.

It's not supposed to sound like a Beetle. The muffler is different. Beetles
fweem, buses fwoom. It's supposed to sound like a lawn mower.
