For  example: you know those 2 little bolts on the face of your drums?
They  interfere with the 14&quot; alloys I have. So when I put those guys on
I have to  remove those bolts. The shape of the stock steelies make

hey Don  I have some audi rims on my sycro, don't know what year they  came 
off of but I cut a small notch on the back of the drrum for clearing those  
bolt heads. Works either way  later  Mark  Dearing
