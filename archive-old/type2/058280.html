Subject: re transaxle drive flanges

You know there are grease seals around the outside of those flanges,
just like on front and rear axles.  You have to pull the flanges to
replace the seals, of course, but it isn't hard if you have a seal
puller (available at most auto parts stores) and snap ring pliers to
pull the clip that holds the flanges on the splined shafts.  Jim
Thompson has seals, and so do lots of other places, I guess.  If there
are leaks, then the seals are likely shot.  Cheap to replace.  While
the flanges are out, you can check the splined shafts, etc.
