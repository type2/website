Subject: Troubles installing Westy interior (65) in '67 splitscreen
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi,

I found 3 wooden bows and I don't know where to put them.
I think they must be fixed on the roof (inside) to attach the wood veneer to
it.
But I don't know where. -&gt; Do I have to fixe them to the iron bow on the
roof, or between them ?

Thanks,
Gunther
