Subject: Re: barrel shims

If your parts are clean and no sealer is applied you
will not have too much of a problem here. I always use
something to snug down the cylinder but never as snug
as assy torque. The point is that a few 0.001&quot; error
(bigger) in deck ht will not make any difference IF
you are using off the shelf shims of the next higher
size. If calculations say you need 0.051&quot; shim and you
use a stock one that is say 0.062&quot; (not really sure
that this is stock?) you will have a very slightly
lower then planned CR but thats OK! Now if you are
going to custom grind shims to get that perfect 7.3 CR
thats another story.
