 All type IV cases were created equal and are all 100% 
interchangeable.  You 
  can take any type IV long block from a 72-78, bolt on your old intake, 
  
   
&gt;  In fact all T4 cases aren't quite created equal.  Beyond what we had been
&gt;previously discussing about Vanagon cases  having the obvious breather box,
&gt;dipstick tube hole, and not so obvious 10mm bearer mounting holes there are
&gt;more differences. 

I think Wilsons ominous statement, p.38,col.1, 'There is no interchange
between the two styles (vanagon vs. all others) only because the crankcase-
breather area is different' is something that needs more explanation.


&gt;I didn't look but wonder if the length of the oil pickups 
&gt;change slightly as the new wall is forward of the old one. Another 
&gt;difference, dual oil pressure relief valves. 
&gt; I do know that hydraulic lifter cases only have the one main 
&gt;relief valve and a plug where the second one would be and of course no 
&gt;drilling for its return into the sump. 

This is the first I'd heard of this. I believe all the type 4's are dual
relief cases, I've never seen a plugged control valve hole. On the late bus
motor, 72-79, the crankcases are pretty much identical with exceptions made
for the different applications (Fuel injected 411 sedan vs carburated 1.8 bus
vs 77 Fuel Injected 2 liter bus, etc.) 

&gt; Of course as well the fuel pump is 
&gt;not drilled on FI cases and 914 cases feature the same dipstick drilling 
&gt;as Vanagon cases, as perhaps do 411/412 cases. 

I just made friends with a 71 411 FI case and it shares the same oil breather
set-up as the carburatered buses, but has the fuel pump port blanked and the
oil filler port blanked. There is dipstick drilling just about where it ends
up on the vanagon case, but there also appeared to be a hole machined down
inside the breather area in one corner. perhaps it gave the option of running
the dip inside or outside the breather. It came with a spring dipstick that
was quite lame and needed to rig one up. oil filler neck and cap is part of
the breather, checking and filling oil are a bit of a bus having to come
through the top to do it without spillage. Good thing it didn't leak.



&gt;All in all pretty trivial 
&gt;changes but it does make me wonder what would be PROPER for retrofit 
&gt;of hydraulic lifters to a solid lifter 1700-2000 case, particularly if the 
&gt;second relief valve should be blocked 

me too. I just wouldn't do it. On the other hand I wonder if I could futrofit
solid lifters in my 1980, and if so, I'd probably have to change the valve
springs, the camshaft, lifters and which cam would be the magic (stock) one in
that application?

  
&gt; One could 
&gt;simply run 4 helicoils into a Vanagon case for Bus use or I guess try to 
&gt;extract the inserts for Vanagon use from a Bus case. 

Has anyone tried this?
