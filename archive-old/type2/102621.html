&gt; Hey all.
&gt; 
&gt; I am thinking of installing this 2.4 911 engine and 901 tranny I have into my
&gt; bus, but I am still just kind of pipe dreaming about it.
&gt; 
&gt; I know I am going to have to install the oiltank and figure out a CV joint
&gt; conversion, mod the tin,etc, but does anyone have any info on a 911 engine
&gt; swap into a late model bay? There is a dead link on www.type2_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I have a complete 914 2.0 engine I am parting out (minus heads)
&gt; tin,FI,dist...all there. Let me know if there is anything you may want.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again,
&gt; 


Chris,

I'm not going to poop on your idea. I think a 911 powered bay bus would be
awesome. Dream on, I've dreamed of it as well. It is the only conversion
into a bay bus worth considering, IMO.

The cv joint conversion should be easy. Have you seen the bus with a vortec
v-6 and 911 trans? There might be some info on that site. Google search for
&quot;vortec vw bus&quot;.
