I got a 71 westy as part payment for the 73 9 passenger that i sold a month 
ago. The condition was the bus would not idle and kept dying when the brakes 
were applied. Fixing and resetting the choke and cam adjustment (along with 
switching to an 009 dist.) helped the idling condition but not the stalling 
when braking. For that I replaced the vacuum line with a new one-way air 
check, but had the same conditions. I then replaced the brake servo unit, but 
found a brake resevoir to master cylinder line with rubber gaskets shot and 
mushy and clogging up the fluid line, so whenever  I poured fluid in it would 
splash out onto the street.  I also found two bad motor mounts. I'd replace 
the motor mounts with the engine in, both old mounts had separated from the 
rubber, but when I tried to unbolt the left hand mount, the bolt spun and 
spun with no bite on the other side. Too confined to get universal vise grip 
in there, so I dropped the motor and sawed the bolt off, replaced the motor 
mounts with new ones, disassembed the motor far enough to replace the intake 
manifold bolts with new ones, while I was there I replaced the end casting to 
head gaskets as well, removed the heater boxes and checked them for 
operationalness and replaced one. reinstalled the heater boxes and 
reinstalled the muffler with the new kit so everything sealed real good. 
Found the cross member center bolts loose so I tightened them, installed a 
new fan belt, and in the interest of giving the stock distributor a chance to 
work, dug it back out of the box, installed a new condensor and rotor to go 
with the new points and cap, installed the distributor and replaced the wires 
with new bosch wires, and new bosch plugs instead of champions. washed 
everywhere I could reach inside the engine compartment with simply green and 
a toothbrush, reinstalled the motor, dug out those little metal vacuum lines 
from the kitchen, the ones that allow the distributor to drawn vacuum from 
the carburators, and installed them with bits of new vacuum line on the ends. 
rehooked everything up, installed the stock three piece tail -pipe and 
dampner pipe set up with a bracket, which I'd never done before, installed 
the rear bumper,  brought the valves to number one and installed new valve 
cover gaskets, timed it statically with the light, realized that I forgot to 
reattach the thermostat and found that I once again dropped the thermostat 
rod through the wrong head hole, so I put the thermostat and bracket in my 
'next job' bag, and reattached the small shroud piece.  Then I went under the 
front and examined the brake fluid resevoir refill line that was leaking like 
a sieve due to rotten rubber gaskets. Found a radiator coupler (black platic 
connector) from the 'help' section of my local wheels, sawed a half inch off 
the small port, and it fit perfectly between the refill line and the master 
cylinder, installed two hose clamps and filled the resevoir with fluid - no 
leaks!. I started the motor and let it warm up without the thermostat, it 
idled too low - to the point of dying so i tweaked the mixture screw a bit 
til the idle rose, then I let it run for 15 minutes or so. Pumped the brakes 
a bit - they have quite a bit of air in them and need to be bled, but the 
replacement servo worked! success. 
	left to do: bleed the brakes, adjust the distributor to 5degrees 
after TDC, readjust the carburator 	as needed. If 
		unsuccessful switch back to the 009. 

	Next Time Engine Comes Out:  installed thermostat rod through proper 
hole, install new 3 piece engine seal, 		pressure plate, throw 
- out bearing and new return spring kit.  This stuff isn't broken yet but 
seems pretty worn. The 		engine seal is shot and the engine door seal is 
missing.
