Subject: Re: [T2] enigne woes - mucho backfiring

Thank you all for your responses

I do get some popping through the carb throats.  I was also told by the PO
that my brake booster has a hole in it.  I will try plugging the line to the
booster and see if that helps.   As far as valves go, they were just
adjusteda couple of weeks ago, bus has not really moved since (too busy
fixing stuff on it)  As far as idele mixture goes, I dunno.  I think my
carbs are pretty dirty.  Turning the big screw (air bypass) does not affect
idle speed.  Timing is right on.  I have not checked for exhaust leaks yet.
Should I look around the head or ???  I know it is time for a new muffler
( a couple of holes - small)
I hope that clarifies a bit.  I could really use some help on this one.  I
have always thought that it might be a vac leak but not really sure.
