Subject: '80 fuel injection and oil cooler
Date: Thu, 25 Feb 1999 06:26:39 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain

     I recently purchased an '80 Westy that had a great interior but 
wouldn't run (paid $200).  I'm currently rebuilding the 2.0 but have a 
couple of questions.

1. In an effort to fix the problem the PO removed the fuel injection 
wires (I don't know why!). The problem is he didn't mark electrical 
plugs so I can't tell which injector to plug them into.  I have a 50% 
chance of getting them right.  How can I find out which plug goes where?  

2. Is it necessary to always replace the oil cooler with rebuilding the 
engine?  Is it possible to flush the oil cooler out and replace it 
later?  I'm on a limited budget with this project, but would like to 
start camping locally ASAP.

Thanks in advance for your help!
