Hello fellow list members~

My roommate from here in San Francisco is out traveling for a few months, 
and after making the trek from SF to Or and back, then on to Minnesota 
without a problem, the westy is suddenly in need of help and she isn't 
having much luck finding an air-cooled VW guy to work on it.

She has a 74 westfalia, and it was running wonderfully before she left.
What is happening now is &quot;When I finally get it started, it feels like the 
back end is sitting in Mud, it just doesn't want to move&quot; - her words, not 
mine.
I do not even know what that could be, so if anyone has any suggestions for 
a good Minneapolis VW guy that could come out and take a look, or she could 
get in touch with that would be super!

She has a place to stay there, so it isn't an AIRS issue, but she will need 
to get it running to find a temp job and such for the period of time she 
will be staying there.



Christopher
76 Westy - &quot;honey&quot;
