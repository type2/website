Subject: The old Lorax strikes again

Hello,
Alot of new listees since i last wrote.
fewer arguements with the lorax is why I havent.
but now..oh, now we have a problem.
I bought a long block from AVP this time last summer, i had troble
getting things right. I found the main problem was with the mech's I was
visiting. I found someone reputable Horst Fischer in Delware. he's been
great. the other day I was driving and pulled up to a light and stalled.
It kept happening. I tried on my own to figure it out I did varios
testing and finally took it over to Horst. two days later I go to pick
it up and horst tells me the compression is way down in #1 and if the
additive to the gas doesn't free it up then I will most likely need to
pull the engine. How can this be?? I just bought the long block-I wasn't
anticipating this kind of fix for a while. Why and what can I do?
I've been driving it for two days now and the power is WAY up.
thankfully.
so maybe it will fix itself.
