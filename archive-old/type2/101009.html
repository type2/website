&gt; I have a 78 std with the stock muffler setup.  I have a section

&gt; I am considering using it when I rebuild, but am concerned with the 
&gt; diameter of the hole at the collector in the middle...it seems to be 
&gt; smaller than the normal exhaust pipe!

I have a set of header type pipes made from original VW heater pipes so
they are the exact size,  when I converted my 78 to the older 72-75
exhaust system this became &quot;surplus&quot; if you are interested and I can find
all the pieces???
