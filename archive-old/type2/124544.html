Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Building door panels

I made some similar door panels on my old Spiffy bus that came out pretty 
good several years ago. FWIW if you are using 1/4&quot; panel and want to cover 
it with material, in my case the material was thick enough so that when I 
used 1/4 staples they didn't stick through on the front side. They held up 
real well.
