Subject: Re: [T2] Source for Retractable Awning?

I'll let you know about my experiences.  I purchased a fairly expensive one
called Dometic from Camper World.  It was very nice and attached to the drip
rails.  Two major problems, 1. It would hit the pop top when I opened it and
even put a small tear in the canvas the first time I closed it.  2. If I
wanted to leave my camping site, it was a pain to close it up everytime I
wanted to go out for a few minutes.

My solution was to sell the awning (at a loss) to a buddy with a trailer and
purchase an EZ up from WalMart for about 1/4 the cost.  I did purchase the
EZ up that has a PEAK, not a POINT so the rain slides off to each side when
I park at one end.

The EZ up is quicker to put up than the awning, but doesn't store as easy.
I can also put sides on the EZ up if it's cold or raining to make a complete
incloser.  And maybe the best point, I don't have to take it down when I
want to go for a short trip and leave all my camping stuff just sitting on
the ground.

I do pull a Scamp camper most of the time and it has it's own awning, but
the EZ up is always waiting for those quick trips when I just take the bus.

&gt; I am interested in getting one of those retractable awning do hick-ees. You
&gt; know, the one that rolls up into a bazooka tube that hangs out along the roof
&gt; line of the bus?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know a good brand, a good source to check, or have any experience with
&gt; these?
