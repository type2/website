Subject: RE: In Support of Matt Ramsey (was Beware of Matthew J. Ramsey)

&gt;Whatever miscommunication occurred between he and Terry that inspired Terry

&gt;to post a public bashing of Matt

teach me to not read the most recent digest before I speak.  My appologies
to all for the proverbial beating of the dead horse.
