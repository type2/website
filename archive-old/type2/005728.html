Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure extension hose

The absolute best thing we have found for fittings of any type is &quot;loctite
518&quot; it will hold on oil systems that have 120PSI on the gauge, I live by
the stuff, on all fittings, it allows the fittings to be removed easier than
the hydro locker, we tried that too. I hate oil leaks, and this is the stuff
for the job..Last week I used it on a dry sump system with 13 fittings, and
not a one leaked..

&gt; Lock-tite makes a hydraulic system sealer.
&gt;
&gt; Check with your local industrial supplier. This sealer is used on
machinery
&gt; with hydraulic systems.
&gt;
&gt; It comes in a nice size bottle that should last for you several years.
&gt;
&gt; Mine was red, dunno if there are different colors or if the colors
&gt; represent different qualities.
&gt;
&gt; This stuff is very good for leaky drain bolts, senders, oil pan bolts and
&gt; such. In my experience it does no locking work like lock-tite nor does it
&gt; electrically insulate that it is sealing.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone finds out anything different let me know.
&gt;
&gt; Ciao!
