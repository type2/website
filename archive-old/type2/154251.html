&gt; I'm sure the other lemmings considered the first one over the cliff a 
&gt; &quot;bold and decisive leader&quot;... ;-(

Actually, the first one over was duped by Disney.  The whole &quot;over the 
cliff&quot; thing was staged by the Disney camera crew filming a documentary 
called &quot;White Wilderness&quot;.  Lemmings were tossed onto a snow-covered 
turntable and tossed off a cliff to simulate the mad exodus over the edge:

soon.
