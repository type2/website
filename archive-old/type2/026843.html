I am having electrical problems with my 71 bus. Here what has transpired 
thus far - it is a long story I thank all you who dare to read it, even if 
you don't have answers…

It all started on a road trip (of course). Someone told me my brake lights 
were not working. Checked the fuse and blown. Replaced the fuse and tail 
lights (maybe brake also - don't remember - suffice to say bottom bulbs) on 
all the time. I replaced some frayed wires at the brake switches on the 
spot, still no luck (of course cause there was a short somewhere). Jiggled 
wires under the dash and back to working order. Brake lights, tail lights - 
all ok.

So a month or so later, they are out again - same deal, blown fuse…replace 
fuse, jiggle here, jiggle there…
So I finally get under and take a good look - well someone in the bus' prior 
life did some rewiring of the brake switches. Still, there were some badly 
frayed wires at the switches. I decide to replace all that. Including brake 
switches, both of them. Initially I replaced just the frayed ends, all of 
them at the switches. Then I noticed that a little further away from the 
switches, two wires had melted some, the black wire to the brake light 
warning bulb (which wasn't fully connected anyway) and the black wire to the 
fuse. For fear that they might have melted somewhere in the casing and maybe 
melted into other wires shorting them out, I have replaced ALL these wires, 
the two black, the black/red to the emergency flasher switch (E3 -term 54), 
and the red to the warning light. The other wires to the switch, as modified 
by someone in the past is as follows:

On the front switch, if you look at it with the red wire term at the top 
(horiz.) (goes to warning light AND top term on rear) and two vertical 
terms, left and right, you find that from the left term is the black wire to 
the fuse box (fuse #10). The right term has a blue (after-market) wire that 
goes to the right brake light.) On the back switch, again red on top, 
connected to other red and to brake warning light, left term is black wire 
to brake warning light, and right term is red/black to emergency flasher 
switch (E3-term 54), AND another blue wire to the left brake light). Note 
there is no black wire connecting the two left terms, but there never has 
been and it used to work. Funky wiring, huh? Well, it used to work, even 
though it is not what Bently wiring diagram says.

To be honest, I can't even figure how the Bently manual wiring can work, or 
I can't understand it. First of all it doesn't discriminate between the top 
bulb (turn signal) and the bottom bulb, (brake and tail). Then it has a wire 
going to term 54 on each and if you follow those, as I did in  the diagram 
and on the car, it goes to the turn signal. Isn't 54 for brake lights and 58 
for tail, side marker, and license bulb (which also doesn't work anymore). 
The 58 wires seem only to go to the side marker, license circuits.

Horn - also original horn does not work - a horn mounted on the steering 
column has replaced it. I replaced these wires just in case also - horn 
works, lights don't. (The horn switch oddly enough used to turn the high 
beams on and off as well as using the turn signal arm to do so. Not sure if 
it still does this or not. Wonder how they did that?)

So here is the current situation - usually the turn signal lights and the 
tail light (the shorter of the two wires in the tail/brake bulbs) are always 
on. Sometimes they are always off. Either way I'm not legal. Igf I take out 
fuse #10, and ONLY fuse #10, then I can make the lights go out. So, thinking 
the short lies somewhere in this circuit, I have replaced every wire leading 
from fuse #10, (one to the coil, the black one to the front brake switch, 
and the horn.) along with many other wires, mentioned above. I suspect there 
maybe two problems, obviously a short (as I can jiggle wires and make lights 
go out.) but I can't find it, viewing or replacing every wire for 3 days 
now. Other problem is the brake lights not working - even with the short - 
the brake part of the bulb doesn't work, and when they are all out I can't 
get the brake lights to work.

Questions-
1. Where is my short?
2. How should the brakes be wired?
3. How should the brake light warning bulb be wired? Red to bulb, then there 
is a #15 and a'k'. Which does the black wire from the switch go to and which 
does the brown wire to the instrument panel insert go? Does this light 
really matter to get the brake lights to work, or is it soely a saftey 
measure, albeit a good one?)
Thanks all
wink
