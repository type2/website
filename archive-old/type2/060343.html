      yeah, I can't imagine why anyone would want to do this. If you're going
to go to all the trouble of a conversion, why not something current, like an
Audi? Much easier to get parts (not to mention the initial transplant itself)
and one heck of lot more reliable. Probably a lot more power as well,  and with
the definite potential for even more ponies.
      I used to have a Corvair. Wasn't really very impressed with the design or
the workmanship, and never had even the slightest inclination to put one in a
VW, even back when they were a lot more common.
