Esteemed Listmates,

For years now I have had to turn my key  manually to the run position on
the switch as the recoil spring seemed to be broken.  Now it appears
that my ignition switch has developed a short as well (healthy spark
when you connect the battery even though nothing is connected or on) my
question is... is the recoil a part of the electrical portion of the
switch or the mechanical (I assume mechanical)  has anybody else had to
fix this?  Is it possible to get a complete replacement switch (69 bus)?

Thanks,
Steve
