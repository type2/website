Subject: Re: [T2] rear axle fell off (!)



&gt; 
&gt; hi all
&gt; I was driving home today, went to turn out of an intersections and BOOM!
&gt; then bang bang bang as I started to move.... I first thought the clutch
&gt; went..... but i was still moving when I engaged the clutch..
&gt; Luckily I was only about 2 miles from home.
&gt; Got a tow home and got under there.....
&gt; 
&gt; The Right Rear axle was completely free of the rear wheel, bolts and all.
&gt; The bolts all looked ok... as if it had just been removed from the
&gt; wheel......as did the threads they go into..
&gt;  
&gt; The boom was the joint breaking(for lack of a better word) free and the
&gt; banging was the free axle whacking the torsion arm (as well as everything
&gt; in reach i would imagine)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; HOW THE HELL CAN THIS HAPPEN?!!

My money is on the bolts simply backing out.  Examine the bolts closely and see if there is thread damage on the last couple of bolts to 
exit.  Also look for shiny spots on the bolts where the CV rubbed back and forth.  The CVs are one set of bolts on the bus that I always 
use a torque wrench on.  I check them again a hundred miles later.

&gt; I've never touched them so I am cluless
&gt; but I don't think this should result as a sign of wear on the CV's
&gt; axles, or transmission.

No, just that the bolts got loose.  Replace the bolts while you're in there.  Good CV boot kits have the bolts included.

&gt; I am gonna drop the engine and tranny this week to replace my tranny, I
&gt; got a hold of a good one. Im gonna fix this when i do that
&gt; 
&gt; what should i be looking out for?
&gt; should I replace the CV joint over there... it didn't look too bad.... now
&gt; that I have a *real* good look at it....

You have to pull back the boot, wipe the grease away, and take a good look at the balls.  If you see nasty warts on the balls, it's new CV 
time.  Otherwise, all you need is to clean (disassembled in this case, since there's sure to be dirt in there) and regrease.  Replace the 
boots if they are worn or cracked at all.

If you don't have a press, a brass hammer will be very helpful in getting the CV off of the axle.  Buy 2 rolls of paper towels and lots of 
rubber gloves.  It's a greasy job!

&gt; I am still in shock......
