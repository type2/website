Subject: Re: [T2] The Good, the Bad, and the Leaky

I have said for years the Facet pumps are one of the biggest pieces of junk
you can put on your car. I gave up on them after 2 brand new ones left me
walking.

There are much better units, in all aspects, then the Facet. I give the
Facet 4 steaming turds.
