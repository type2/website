Subject: Parts and Help on the Big Island: HAWAII

Hello Listees: I am a resident of Hawaii and a collector of bus parts
for many years (packrat!) mostly Bay window, but also some splitty
stuff. I have a clean front axle beam from a '66 that needs a new home.
No link or kingpins or spindles, just the beam. I can deliver it
anywhere on the Big Island. I also have many new, used and NOS parts to
fit 1966-1979 vans: tuneup supplies, rubber, lenses, latches, glass,
etc.I also do mobile repair and troubleshooting, I'll come to you! Give
me a call: Tim 808-887-2027 ( toll free on Hawaii ) and save yourself a
trip to Hilo ! ALOHA
