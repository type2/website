&gt; &gt; As well, turned drums, which you don't know if you got unless you pull and 
&gt; &gt; measure them, typically don't match the arc of the stock sized shoes. 
&gt; 
&gt; Couple of related, Friday brake questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Am I correct in assuming that brake drums/rotors never need to be turned unless 
&gt; 	they are scored?

Religious arguement.  Brake guys will tell you to turn them every time,
but they get paid to turn them.  It's how they make you pay when you come
in to get your &quot;lifetime brake pads&quot; replaced on warranty.

I don't turn rotors or drums unless they are _really_ scored or if
metal-to-metal contact has occured.  The only other reason is if the
brakes are pulsing.  The downside to this is that it takes longer for the
new pads/shoes to wear in.

&gt; 2) When people talk about rear brake lines having collapsed, I assume they mean
&gt; 	the hoses running from the metal brake lines into the drum.  Is this a correct
&gt; 	assumption?

Yes.
 
&gt; 3) Having flushed my brake system until the fluid ran clean, what do I do with the
&gt; 	used brake fluid if the place I dispose of my oil (a FLAPS) will not accept it?
&gt; 	I specifically mean in California, but general information is appreciated as I
&gt; 	periodically move to different states.

I put it all in the same 5-gallon can and pour it into the tank.  Most
&quot;recycled&quot; oil is actually used as bunker fuel on ships, so the brake
fluid should burn just fine.  Ships aren't picky.
