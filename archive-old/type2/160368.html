Subject: Re: [T2] Coil Question again

Hi Rae,

Were you on the way to EveryBus?  Both times that I've seen this  
problem came up it was during my annual EveryBus trip.

I first saw the same problem occur when it happen to Jeff Stewart in  
2001, and it happened to my bus in 2006. Get another coil.


Happy Trails,
