Subject: Dead Front axle beam (Was: UPDATE: NJ inspection woes)

Patrick,

Point a browser at:

http://www.everybus_dot_com/dworkin/axle_beam/pages/P1270008.htm

That is a dying beam.  look at the uprights on either end of your beam for
any sign of rust.  Since my experience has been that the beam rusts out
from the inside, by the time you see it, the only solution is to replace.
Also, replace quickly!  The first sign means that vast areas are thin and
you can go from godd to marginal to dead in a matter of months.

                           Steve Dolan

&gt; Incidentally, a couple of you appropriately asked about the integrity of my
&gt; front beam.  I've checked it out in the past (I just put new shocks, sway
&gt; bar &amp; steering dampner on this summer so had lots of time to look around
&gt; down there :), but can't say I know exactly what I'm looking for.  If I post
&gt; some pictures to a website maybe some of y'all can tell me if it looks bad?
