Subject: VW Classic in Irvine - Show a tent for me?

I'm looking for someone who is attending or vending at the VW Classic Show in 
Irvine this weekend that would be willing to setup one of my tents and put 
out a stack of handouts.

I've been trying to contact the promoter to find out details on vending, so 
any arrangement I make would  need to meet their approval.

I need to know this asap so I have time to ship the tent.  I'm willing to 
work out payment for your time and trouble or large discount on the tent.

P-mail if interested.
