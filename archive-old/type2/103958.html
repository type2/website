Subject: Re: [T2] Firing Order

I second the 71 stock dizzy Vs the 009 rotor orientation will be 180 deg. 
out.
I had made the same observation many years ago.
Also I recently removed my stock dizzy to repair a stuck mech. advance.
I had to remove the drive dog off the dizzy to take it all apart and when I 
reassembled it I made the mistake of replacing the drive dog 180 deg off and 
was my face red.
Just drive the pin out with a punch and rotate 180 Deg.
Now it will face the same direction as your stock dizzy. 

Rusty
