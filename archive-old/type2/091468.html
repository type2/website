&gt; I'm going to put some auxiliary batteries in my '74 westy for running

&gt; and have a couple questions about how to hook everything up.

First advice is to forget the battery isolator.  When they fail you can
end up with a dead main battery and full aux battery.

Better to just use the aux battery relay like the Official VW Camper
setup.  Much more reliable and you are assured of your main battery being
charged.
