Subject: Re: 3-point shoulder belts for rear bench?

Re seat belts in rear bench changed to shoulder belts:
We did this in the 78 Westy, using scrounged front seatbelts from a 77.
Use the shoulder mounts located just beneath the rear windows, just
behind the bench.  They are covered with plastic plugs.  The Westy was
missing the wall-side lapbelt mount on the driver side (we took out the
fridge unit and put a triple seat in), and so I removed the wall
paneling to find a location to drill a hole in the innerside of the
double wall (where there is a &quot;X&quot; shape).  Had to drill a 1&quot; hole in the
windowside panel of the rear closet to expose the plug.  The center belt
is still a lapbelt.  The person behind the sink cabinet needs a shoulder
belt to prevent swinging forward and hitting it.  The shoulder mounts
are actually below the shoulder, and you have to run the belt over the
bench top and then your shoulder.
