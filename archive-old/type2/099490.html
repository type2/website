Subject: Re: Upgrading to H4s 

The web pages shown below have schematics for several set ups. I worked 
with Daniel to plan mine and get the components. Browse around his pages 
and read everything a few times first.
I built my own harnesses for one of my cars, and put them in place with the 
components I got from Stern. The result has been most enlightening. I can 
see half a mile ahead with my brights.

Daniel Stern's web page     http://lighting.mbz_dot_org/tech/

He was my consultant on my H4 upgrade project last year, and he answered 
every question, either by email, by his web page, or by a cell phone. And 
there were probably a half dozen exchanges of questions and answers. He is 
located in Texas.

Are there reputable H4 kits and ones to stay away from? I'm a little 
hesitent to just order an expensive kit by description.
