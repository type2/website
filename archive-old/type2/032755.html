It will fit just fine. The two ears at the top of the
72 tranny are for mounting in the 72. You can just ignore 
them. Everything else is the same  EXCEPT that the input
shaft MIGHT be one half inch too long. You have two choices.
1. Cut one half inch off the end of the shaft (very hard to do)
2. Exchange the input shaft with the one on the 71 tranny.

Measure to make sure that this is necessary before doing it.
If the hole in the crankshaft of your engine is deep enough,
it won't matter. But remember so that next time you replace
the engine you will know why you are having trouble installing 
the engine.

Volks;

I found a tranny from a 72.  Will it fit my 71?  Bentley indicates that
the ratios are the same, but what about the bell housing/input
shaft/throw out bearing?  What year did they start with the rear hangars
on the tranny?

Thanks
