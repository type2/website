Subject: Reduce reuse recycle- parts available in Portland Oregon

Hey,
Ive been going through Brandis part stash that I
bought, and after keeping all the stuff I like Im left
with a bunch of stuff that I dont really need, but
hesitate to toss because parts are getting harder and
harder to find, and someone may need/want some of this
stuff. Also there is the whole reduce by reuse thing
that got me into VWs in the first place.

Most of it isnt really terribly valuable unless you
need it. I dont so if you need any of this stuff let
me know, and Ill part with it very reasonably (in some
cases, mostly for my time and postage):

All this stuff is type 4
engine tin (missing a piece let me know, I have it
most likely) 

Alternators one good (least it says so on the tape on
the side, with sheet metal) one 914 2.0L has some
bearing noise.

brand new wheel cylanders rear wheel a matched pair
(just put a set on the bus) these are italian with
brass fittings 20$ with a set of break pads 30$

compressor for AC? VW logo made by nippondenso maybe
some smog thing- never seen one before- comes with
bracket to mount on fan. If your interested email me
and Ill email you the part #.

used vaccum dizzy. looks solid, but I havent used it.
comes with two caps. interested? Ill email you the
part #.

Heater boxes, used good shape. 2 sets two exhaust
holes per side Im selling one set annd the exhaust.



More hoses that run from the fan to the heater box
then you can shake a stick at. few are worth mailin,
but if you need them and live in Portland, you can
have as many as you want.

2 pairs of used heads. on oval port, one square.  look
OK. 

Solex carbs, rebuildable 

one set solex manifolds
no linkage bar.

one original 1700 oilbath air cleaner- just the
central canister- Id never seen one before.

There were also two engines (more or less) and I will
be selling one: either a complete 1700 rebuilt as
1800. It ran when pulled but and spins freely with no
end play. and a case (machined) rod and crank (not
machined) set of 1700 P&amp;Cs (new in box) and the oil
pump and fan and housing (the housing says CB but Im
dont know if it always went with the case.).  any one
who needs/wants a motor should email me and Ill get
back to you once I have made up my mind. engines are
OC quite heavy.

There are also a couple odds and ends 5$ each:
set bugpack repos of westie top tie downs. NIB
clutch cables
coils (everyone needs a spare)

used belows, varying conditions all work. if you arent
picky and need a pair (and will come to PDX you can
have a pair free) the one w/o duct tape are 5$

Im trying top be reasonable, so if you think my prices
are to high, perhaps you should keep in mind that I am
nice guy and will probably take a lower offer. 


There still some stuff Im trying to figure out what it
is...


Things I need (for trades)
childs cot mounting brackets
good used tranny for a 75 bus (trade for a motor?)with
nosecone(mines busted)
interior front door pull handles.
