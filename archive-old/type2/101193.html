Subject: full flow fittings

I''m about to  mount the flexible oil lines  for a Berg full flow 
system. A first for me.

In the instructions, in his own special way, Berg  warns against 
using teflon tape for the joints between 90 degree fittings and the 
case or oil pump cover. His logic makes sense to me.

But has anyone taped the other joints?  These would be
	the ones between the male/male fittings and the 90 degree 
fittings on the case, and
	the ones between the hoses and these male/male fittings.

Hand tightening with no lubricant just feels wrong to me.
