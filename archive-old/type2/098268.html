&gt; Jason,
&gt; I think you missed the STOCK EXHAUST part of the above,, I hope I was correct in
&gt; adding that....

Actually I meant that the engine I am rebuilding is already a solid
lifter engine. But always good to bring in the view point of what
exactly is to be done w/ the engine (i.e., performance &amp; stuff)

&gt; Can I add a request to this thread,,
&gt; If you prefer Solid lifters, can you point out what cam and where to get it 
&gt; if possible.
&gt; 
&gt; or if you found a good hydraulic cam,,,,,

Good thought. Yes, folks. let's get the skinny on cams.
