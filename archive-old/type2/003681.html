Well since others are asking for parts, here is my search:

I need an almost complete set of the original curtains for my buses
restoration. They are the white/yellow/tan plaid curtains from the 72 model
(maybe others, not sure). I have the front windshield curtain, but I need
all the others. I am willing to pay for them of course. Even just one would
help me out. I know I can get aftermarket, but not in the original plaid. I
also have another set of orange plaid curtains proffesionally sewn to trade
out.
The second thing I need is the tray that goes in the bottom of my fridge.
Here is a link to some pics of a camper that has what I need:
