Kevin,

Looking at the (enlarged) pictures, I think your h.e. need to be fixed or
replaced. You certainly don't want a leak inside the h.e., for obvious
health reasons! What I find surprising is that the skin around the h.e.
looks ok while there are rust holes in the much thicker pipe...

Btw, your arrow in picture B points to the h.e., not the exhaust. Also, your
present exhaust system looks like an aftermarket system.

I wouldn't trust the job to Midas; in fact you can do it yourself and save
some money. Replacing the h.e. with a straight pipe is feasible and you can
probably find the pipes from one of the advertizers in HotVWs or VWTrend.
That would buy you some time to find new or used --but good-- h.e.  If you
do remove the h.e., don't forget to block the outlets at the fan housing.

Sami
