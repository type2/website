Subject: Help Cleaning Fiberglass Top

And Rick said thus:

&gt;The article I referred to, and my own pop-top cleaning, involve 
&gt;cleaning the top WHEN IT IS OFF THE VEHICLE and WITH 
&gt;THE CANVAS REMOVED

        OK, folks... How do I get this thing off of the vehicle?!?  I need to take brackets and all off, in order to paint the roof (paint is slip-sliding away).  I would also love to paint the top itself, whilst it is disassembled from the rest of my trusty steed.  I don't want to tear up the wonderful wooden headliner inside in order to remove the front brackets.  Anybody BTDT?  This one's beyond me.


TIA,  Blake
