Subject: re: [T2] BN2 installation

Years ago I had a 72 bus and a friend sold me a nice
gas heater (don't remember the model number so maybe
what I did won't work for you). 
I installed the heater so that it was under the
passenger's feet, part of it was under the floor,
covered by the removable cover that protects the
underside of the pedals, etc., from road debris, and
the rest was right under the passenger's feet.  My
friend had done this in his bus, so I knew it would
work.  I don't remember all the details, but I did
take pictures of it, although I don't know where they
are now, 20 years later.  It worked great--no heat
loss to ductwork, recirculation of warm air, etc.
I recall that I didn't put it in our 68 bus because
there were some differences in the area that I
installed it in that made it fit better in the 72.
