&gt;Regretfully I may have done more damage than good by releasing all of the
&gt;carbon and volcanic pumice into the circulating oil system.
&gt;I had drained the oil into a large plastic pan and while cleaning the pan
&gt;I could see a lot of solid particles resembling volcanic pumice clinging
&gt;to my paper towel even after I had rinsed the pan with solvent.
&gt;I didn't see any *metallic* like iron or copper/silver like you'd get
&gt;with engine bearings or abnormal wear of parts. (pretty well hidden in
&gt;all the black goop I guess).

Stir the bile with your fingertip while shining a light on it. See little
flashes of metallic dust going sparkle, sparkle??? Gauling will come with
further running. Have you checked the crankshaft endplay??? Get ingenious
somehow and measure it at the fan pully. Just grab it best you can and pull
it in and out. If it goes &quot;ca-chunk&quot; every time you push or pull, don't
waste another dime or any more time on less than a longblock rebuild. God
knows it has the right to go &quot;ca-chunk&quot; any time it wants to, as long as
its soon. 


&gt;I just wonder how much of this goo is going to get released with a good
&gt;hard drive of a few hundred miles and with a good detergent motor oil, it
&gt;could be synergic.
&gt;

If you want to risk the core value, I'm willing to wait and see what
happens, as long as I have tried with diligence to advise the client
otherwise. Also, don't forget to mention the risks if you do the big
CACHUNK!!! in an unknow area and you get towed to TSFH (The Shop From Hell).
