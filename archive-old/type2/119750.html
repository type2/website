Subject: Re: [T2] fuel sender repair

from what i understand, you'd be very much better off buying
a new one.

those wires you're talking about are really fragile. even if
you were able to fix it, it would probably break again &amp; you'll
end up having to drop the tank to fix it again.

good luck,

&gt;&gt;I just pulled the gas tank out of my '71 bus last night and as I was 
removing the fuel sender, the second of the 2 thin wires which run 
vertically along the float shaft broke.  

Does current run through these wires or are the just there to guide the 
float?

The sender worked pre-removal, and I'd like to reuse it -- at least for 
the time being -- if I can, especially given that the new sender runs $70 
($70 which other parts of my bus direly needs).&lt;&lt;
