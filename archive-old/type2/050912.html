&gt; This is how VW designed them- to be run at high RPMs.

But, not under a high load.  The reason busses break is that their cooling 
systems are marginal and they overheat if you push too hard.  I think you do 
new owners a disservice by suggesting that it's OK to drive a bus at over 70 
MPH for long periods of time with no adverse side effects.
