Hey Craig,
I just read your page an noted the part at the end on the fuel shutoff
valve.  I think that's a great idea when you're working on stuff like
changing the fuel filter.  Where exactly did you place it in the line
and do you have any recommendations on where and what kind of valve to
get?

Thanks,
Mike
