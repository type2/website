Subject: steering

About a month ago I posted about having steering problems, and geussing that 
the problem was in the plastic coupler disc, when the problem was actually 
the metal piece on the lower axle beam that housed the steering idler pin. 
&gt;From years of P.O. neglect the pin froze and tore the housing right off of 
the axle beam. No amount of welding could fix it. I tracked down a whole new 
front end from a '71 Std. and it fit perfect on my '78 Westy. The disc brakes 
were a bit different, but everything works perfectly. I used Steve Dolan's 
instructions, which can be found at type2_dot_com. One thing I'd like to add is 
to make sure you remove your clutch cable if it's in the way, and not to 
mention the speedo cable. Steve's instructions were perfect and made the job 
faster and easier, very easy to follow.
The list rocks
