Subject: wheel/tire size question...success stories?

Hello all,
I'm new to this list, so I'm not sure if this question will offend any 
purists, but I'll test the waters...
I'd like to know of any success stories that people have had with putting 
non-VW wheels on their Transporters, Vanagons, etc. I have a '78 
Transporter, and have recently found that some Mercedes and Audi models have 
the same lug pattern as my bus. I'd like to put some larger wheels on there 
with some low profile tires and would like to know what offsets/sizes have 
been used successfully in the past by any of you.

Thanks!
Dylan Baxter
