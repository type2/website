Subject: Clutch question

I need a little diagnostic help.  My clutch pedal was feeling soft (1&quot; or so
slop at the top of it's travel, and 1st gear was grinding just a little
going in).  So I tightened the cable about 6 revolutions of the clutch cable
adjusting wingnut at the clutch lever.  The pedal felt immediately better,
nice and firm right up to the top.  I THINK that the grinding disappeared,
but now doubt my feelings, wondering if I just extrapolated from the
improved pedal feel.  Today (adjustment was just a few days ago, maybe 40
miles of travel) 1st gear is definitely tricky to get into without a little
grinding (it can be done, but with much gentleness, way more than  used to
have to do), and (maybe a clue here) reverse is very grabby as you engage
the clutch.  Forward gears are not.

Tranny has never given me a moment's trouble (58,000 on it, all original),
and the gear oil in it is fresh (come to think of it, I'd better go back and
see if I used that correct kind.  It's 90wt hypoid, but that's all I
remember) as of a couple thousand miles ago.

I baby my power trains like noone else I know (my H*nda Civic has 212,000 on
the original clutch), but I bought the bus at 53,000 and don't really know
much about the driving habits of the PO.  I suspect they were pretty gentle,
but...

Am I looking at a new clutch face?  Thanks for the help.
