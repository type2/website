&gt; Hey everybody:
&gt; 
&gt; In order to eliminate a vapor lock problem I had with my 'dub, I installed 
&gt; an electric fuel pump about a year ago.
&gt; 
&gt; People keep trying to tell me that those little rectangular, solid state 
&gt; pumps are not reliable and do not flow a high enough volume at high engine 
&gt; RPMs.

Unless you are running a drag motor you won't run out of gas with any
aftermarket electric pump.  The little electronic pumps are used on 160HP
homebuilt aircraft and have no problem supplying those engines at WOT.

You might need a pressure regulator with the VW carb.
