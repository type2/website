Subject: sheet metal/009 question replies

My mail program has a bad habit of &quot;saving&quot; my mail either to 1) a folder
so deep it takes some digging or 2) it doesn't. So I lost the addresses of
some folks who were interested in any replies to my posts; I'll just summarize
them here if that's OK.
If you need replacement tin, most people swore by Das Bulli Haus, as they
claimed
this was the only on-spec manufacturer. My VW guru here says that other
companies who
are &quot;cheaper&quot; are just fine IF you don't mind/know how to cut, weld, paste, etc.
And don't get mad easily at things that don't fit right out of the box.

The 009/carb /rich exhaust query brought up this:
 &quot;douglas_at_praxis_dot_net
I'm running a 71 case, 1600 DP. The heads (new 040s) have been *hemi* cut
using BERG cutters at my local mach. shop. This gives me a CR of 6.8:1.
With that CR I use a *total* timing advance of 36 degrees with a 30 PICT-1
carb; 120 main, 60 idle, &amp; 145 air correction. By todays standards, this is
a little rich. BUT, I don't heat up, don't ping, it really pulls and gives
me 22 mpg in my 61.

I have also used the Brosol Solex H30/31PICT1 carb on this engine with
great results. This carb is now on by 68 T2 with an 009 where it works
great.

The 009 is a good dist. You just can't throw it into any old engine with
any old carb. and expect it to work well. &quot;
As well as a note about how a similar setup IDLES rich, but runs fine on
another member's bus.
BTW, iI'd like the original post back on that if the sender still has it!
