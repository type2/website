Subject: RE: [T2] No start after running

Great idea Jason,

I will look at that tonight, hopefully before dark :-) Any one remember what
the gap needs to be off of the top of their head? I can look in the  manual,
but what fun is there in that? I'll smell the dipstick per Jules suggestion
also.

Thanks,

Max

One thing missing from this list is what the dwell is set at. Points
that are not in spec might cause a much harder start.
