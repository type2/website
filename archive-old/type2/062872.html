&gt;

&gt;Hold on there pardner...don't fly off the handle just yet.  Most
&gt; enthusiasts
&gt;LOVE have new folks join the flock, rich or poor, old or young, foriegn or
&gt;domestic.  The problem is those folks who buy the bus not to buy a bus, 
but
&gt;to fit into part of an image.  Those are the folks who end up &quot;trashing&quot;
&gt;them.  (Trashing means abusing and neglecting, it does not necessarily 
mean
&gt;not restoring to stock)
&gt;
&gt;Welcome!

Dan has summed up in a few sentences what I was trying to say in 
many.....thanks Dan.  Also, my appologies to Craig.
