Subject: Re: [T2] Gas vapor breather lines

&gt; &gt;VW also put  a lot of caulk around the engine compartment
&gt;
&gt;I noticed that and left all of it alone the last time I went in there with 
&gt;a paintbrush. What is it exactly and where can I locate more? I understand 
&gt;why it's there, I just can't identify it.

Any GOOD FLAPS (not supermarket variety) or any auto body supply shop will 
have this stuff in a half dozen varieties.

I've bought it in caulking tubes and I've got a box of shoe shoe string 
type caulking that I just place along the seam and press into place.
