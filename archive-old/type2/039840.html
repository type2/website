&gt; Hi folks:
&gt;
&gt; I found an alternator kit in Dallas on Sat.   Went out to Albany, TX,
pulled
&gt; the engine in a parking lot and did the install.  Everything went soothly.
&gt; I ran into one problem, I have a 34-PICT-3 located in the center, and now
&gt; the throttle assembly hits the side of the alternator so I can only get
&gt; about 1/4 throttle.  Is there a kit to move that carb over a little?

You need to grind or file the edge of the alternator where the accellerator
pump lever strikes it.  Be very careful not to grind to much off.  Just set
the carburator on the intake manifold and pull the lever down, note where it
touches, then grind some more until it clears.  I use a die grinder
 Snap-On 26,000 RPM ).

Also,
&gt; on the alternator tin, there are three pieces. a ring and two large disks.
&gt; I put the ring on the end of the alternator and sandwiched the two disks
&gt; together.  That leaves a small rectangular opening, should that go in on
top
&gt; or on bottom?
hmm,

&gt; Check the Bently manuel.  The small ring goes between the inner and outer
backing plates. I am not sure about the rectangular opening you mention.

&gt; I decided to drive to Ft. Worth at quarter impulse, everything seemed to
go
&gt; smoothly, although it was a little slow. Anyway, about a mile from my
&gt; friend's house, the engine temp sky rocketed.  The oil was at 255 F when I
&gt; noticed it.  Apparently, a piece of paper towel got sucked into the fan.
&gt; This happened within about mile, so hopefully no major damage.  I'll reset
&gt; the valves tomorrow.
&gt;
Were you driving with 1/4 throttle?

&gt; Helpful advice appreciated..
