Subject: Re: [T2] Ride height

Arnaud,

Adjusting ride height--I've done it, it's not easy, rather I think it's 
one of the hardest jobs on the bus.  must remove rear wheel bearing 
carrier housings (thats right the entire rear end), remove spring plate 
caps and spring plates and adjust torsion bars. the procedure is in 
Bentley.  I followed it exactly and still got same sag--should have 
adjusted more.  I should have marked where the spring plates hung 
(unloaded) to start with so I could adjust for sag from there.  BE SURE 
to mark your carrier housings to the spring plate top and bottom before 
removing (use a cold chisel) to preserve rear alignment.  the big nuts 
are 22mm you will need a socket/breaker bar and a wrench, and an 
inclinometer to measure angles and make sure the bus is perfectly level 
on the frame rails.

instead of doing the job over (yuk) I recently bought a pair of monroe 
coil-over shocks which got me about 1.5&quot; back but still about 1&quot; short 
(coil overs were stock on some '73-'74 buses as part of a heavy-duty 
suspension package).  for more info cf:  
http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/74Loadlevelers.htm.

I have heard rumors that the KYB gas shocks in front cause the front to 
go up thereby causing the back to sag but I am not sure if this is 
true.  I will try stock Boge's up front next week and see how it goes.  
then Koni's if they ever come in. 

good luck,
Will A.

PS. list:  I am heading to Colorado for 12 days next week leaving from 
Atlanta Tues.  Let me know if there might be any AIRS assistance / road 
hospitatility available.  Everything seems to be in order for the trip.
