Subject: POR15 Needed ASAP !!
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Wise List,

I need to get a complete POR15 auto fuel tank repair kit for Casper as soon 
as possible. (Thought I had one in my store shed)

Anyone have a RELIABLE source that will give me high probability of my 
getting it shipped off today so I will have it tomorrow ??
