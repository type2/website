Subject: Rocky Mountain Motorworks Bankruptcy Filing

For those of you who don't already know, Rocky Mountain Motorworks filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week. Chapter 11 means reorganization,
not liquidation, so this does _not_ mean that they are closing their doors.

The reason why I'm mentioning it here (obviously it will be mentioned here
sooner or later anyway, as this type of news tends to travel) is because
there were some questions on one of the other lists regarding whether The
Bus Depot would be affected by that filing. The confusion stemmed from the
fact that we sometimes use Motorwork's wholesale division as a drop-ship
supplier for Bus Depot orders.  So just in case anyone had any doubts, I
wanted to clear it up preemptively.

The Bus Depot is not related to Rocky Mountain Motorworks, and is in no way
affected by their bankruptcy filing. While we do deal with their wholesale
division (which has always been quite reliable, incidentally), they are one
of dozens of suppliers that we deal with, both domestically and abroad. It's
a tough business; the faces seem to change from one year to the next, both
on the retail and wholesale sides.  Last year alone, two of my suppliers
folded, and one new one opened up.  That's why I always try to line up
multiple sources for each product I sell, &quot;just in case.&quot;

Thanks to your loyal support (and I really mean that), we're doing better
than great.  We've been in non-stop growth mode ever since I first announced
I was starting the business. (On this very list, in fact - what, maybe 6 or
7 years ago? Jeez, has it been that long already?!!)   And I plan to still
be here, relieving you of your hard earned money and screwing up your
orders, when Eurovans are considered antiques. :-)
