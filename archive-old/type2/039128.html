Subject: Re: Tranny Oil Cooler Question??

wondering (nothing better to do, yeah right)

I have an auto tranny in my 78, and was wondering...

.  at what temp should the fluid operate at/too hot??
.  has anyone tried a temp guage (was thinking a sump sender oil temp
guage)
.  what about an oil cooler, anyone tried one?  how did you hook it up??
    did it have a significant effect??

I was musing on putting a fitting on either side of the sump with a small
electric pump circulating from one side to the other through a cooler, and
maybe a filter, not the most efficient but without a lot of drilling on
the case I can't think of any other way to get it in there.

  my bus with the drop floor and interior I know has to be at least
1,000lb over stock weight, tranny coolers are on a lot of vehicles that
tow so, was thinking

 Coments?!?!
