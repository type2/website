Subject: Re: Need Intake Manifold Data on 1971 Bus Engine

I assume that this is a dual port motor?  First of all you're going to have to
drill and tap the case so that you can mount it to the rear engine hangar on
your 71...or you're going to have to get an oil pump adapter kit (the first
option being the best...hopefully its a universal case...I'm not familiar with
the beetle stuff).
What I did for my 71 bus is I drilled a hole in the intake manifold and then got
myself a piece of small steel tubing and cut off a chunk.  I ground it down just
a tinch so that it was a snug fit in the hole I drilled.  Now comes the fun
part!  Strike up the torch and braze it in!  I did this with mine and its air
tight...worked out really nice.  You can do this at the neck of the intake
manifold...which is the best place to do it.

Hope this helps?

&gt; I just bought a 73 bug engine to put in my 71 Westy and need some
&gt; information from someone with a 71 bus that has the stock manifold.
