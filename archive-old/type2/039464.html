I have also had the same problem but found that it was possible to remove
the engine without totally removing the tranny.

&gt; Having had the exact same problem, I'm afraid I can tell you that you will
&gt; have to reconnect the motor and trans, then remove the motor and trans as a

put the main motor bolts back in and lower the engine tranny as a unit in
the rear (don't need to disconnect anything but the rear yoke bolts from
the tranny) a few inches enough so that you can pull the engine straight
back about 6-8 inches.  now remember things are at an angle but if you
pull the engine straight back you will pull the slines of the tranny out
of the torque converter.   as you back the engine out have a pair of long
nosed pliers or long hemostats handy there are 3 shafts that need to come
out of the converter, the innermost one (oil pump) tends to pull out with
the converter, it is about a 1/2 inch in diameter and can easily be
damaged, as soon as you can see it, grab it with the long nosed pliers and
push it back into the tranny, as soon as it clears the engine can be
lowered all the way to the ground and the torque converter easily comes
off.  BTW I have found a bicycle wrench at 13mm which is very thin can
frequently be shoved into the space between the engine and the bell
housing and if you are lucky you only need to pull the engine less than an
inch and you can reach in and remove the 3 (only 3) bolts off the flex
plate.  this means you don't have to remove the tranny at all.  it takes
some gymnastics to do it this way but I almost always put my TQ back onto
the flex plate this way.

&gt; FWIW, get a few friends to help you drop the engine. It helps, and after
&gt; that, if they're still friends, you will need them to get the engine back

for sure, the torque converter adds about 50lbs to the engine weight, of
an already very heavy engine

&gt; &gt; I have a 1974 westy with an 1.8L engine with duel carbs, automaic
&gt; &gt; transmission. The engine crank won't turn over so i decided to drop  the
&gt; &gt; engine.  i removed carbs, and electrical wiring from engine. also the 4
&gt; &gt; bolts that hold the trans to the engine. as well i removed the two bolts
&gt; &gt; from the engine mounts, on both sides (i have a chain round the trans
&gt; &gt; ready to support its weight). I am following the directions in the

also take off the coil and the tin in the rear (3 pieces usually) and the
oil fill tube.

&gt; &gt; Robert Bently manual. it says to remove 4 bolts from the torque
&gt; &gt; converter through the hole that was machined in the flange next to where

This is wrong the flex plate to torque converter only has 3 bolts (on
every one I have ever seen) these bolts are unique so hang on to them and
try not to damage them as they are very hard to replace (ask me how I
know)

&gt; &gt; the engine and trans join. this involves turning the crank so that you
&gt; &gt; can visably see and remove each bolt from the converter as it turns

if you pull the engine apart from the tranny about an inch, you can
frequently see the 3 bolts and turn them off (with much much verbal
encouragement, this is a truely PITA project) give yourself about 2 hours
for the 3 bolts using a straight open end 13mm wrench. nothing else will
work.

&gt; &gt; cause i would really rather not do that. The engine only seems to be
&gt; &gt; connected to the trans, but maybe i'm forgting to disconnect something
&gt; &gt; else?

if you can pull the engine away from the trans even a little bit, you
probably have all the mounting removed.  the tranny shafts go into the TQ
about 6 inches, about the same as the lower studs so the length to pull it
is about the same, but WATCH out for the oil pump shaft it wants to stay
with the TQ and it is about 2ft long
