Hi, all not been around for some time due to hardware failure, baby new
business venture yada yada yada, well Mrwhipy's almost ready! I think it
will be almost a year to the day when he rolls out the yard not bad being as
it was supposed to be _April_! :(

Now that he's all orange &amp; white he looks more like a traffic cone than an
ice-cream van, so a new name is needed any ideas?

Also we are moving from smelly London to the Forest of dean on the welsh
borders near the Severn bridge anyone local to there or know the area?
