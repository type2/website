Subject: Heat riser Plugged SP conversion

Will there be a day I do not have to post to these lists???

I am continuing my work on my DP to SP conversion.The heat riser from the SP
engine is plugged beyond belief. I have worked on it from both ends with
wire then aircraft cable on the end of a drill ( had to stop for a while and
go buy an electric drill as my cordless could not keep up the pace). I
finally stopped when I found that if I blew on the end, air came out around
the aluminum sleeve on the same side. What have I done?

Last night I heated the carbon with an acetylene torch then switched to
oxygen. That took me nowhere as there was NO flow through the thing. :-(

When I measure, it looks like I have about 1-2 cm to get through before I
can try the torch again.

The archives mention drilling a hole to get better access, but that really
seems extreme. Is this what I have to do?

Also, what if I have to put this engine back into the 1971 bus? What will I
do for a brake booster connection?

MANY thanks for all the replies I get via P-mail. They are appreciated even
if I do not send a thank you e-mail. I figure you are watching my progress
on these lists!
