&gt; Hiya All,
&gt;
&gt; 70 Bus.  The shifting action is very vague.  Not much resemblance to 
&gt; the old
&gt; &quot;H&quot; pattern at all.  Sometimes an adventure just to find first gear.


When I unscrewed the stickshift and removed the rubber boot that it 
passes
through in the cabin, in an attempt to lubricate/placate my squeaky 
stick shift,
that there was a tremendous amount of gunk built up in the linkage there.

After ~1-2 hours of cleaning and resetting the shift plate, I had a MUCH 
cleaner
shifting action.  You might look in there first...
