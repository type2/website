Actually, I hold both American and Canadian citizenship, and no, I am not
angry, nor planning an invasion (a backcountry skiing vacation to snowy Utah
this winter perhaps, though!) I am just tired of some members of the list
periodically wasting my bandwidth with their public bickering. Another
member of the list mentioned recently to me about the &quot;downright
insulting&quot;,&quot;down-low&quot; things that had been said to him/her by members of
this list in response to a question posted to the list. I would suggest that
we all bear in mind that the purpose of this list is to *assist* other
members, and keep insults and pissing contests off list, and that those who
cannot do this be banned.

Cheers, and Thanks to the other 99%!
Matthew
