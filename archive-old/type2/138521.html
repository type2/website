Subject: RE: [T2] Heater tube through or over the front beam?

http://daniel3.atiba_dot_com/images/daniel/VW/71Westy/Underneath/viewer.asp

On my 71 Westy it goes over. It had hoses that went to the mid cabin that I 
blocked off with rags. I'm pretty happy with my heat but it seems to have 
gotten worse lately, warm air is escaping somewhere.

-Daniel

&gt;I was looking under my bus today, attempting to
&gt;ensure that all heating components are attached.
&gt;I notice that the heater tube is sitting
&gt;completely on TOP of the front beam-- and looks
&gt;smashed.
