Subject: Choke Butterfly removal

Volks -

I want the choke on my 34-PICT-3 to move the stepped idle cam, but not choke
the air. Ergo, I want to remove the choke butterfly.

Not having been in a carb for a long time, I just want to get straight what
needs to happen.

The butterfly must be removed by unscrewing the two screws that hold it to
the shaft. But the shaft needs to come out in order to slide the butterfly
off it, right? If yes, which side does it slide out from? The choke side, or
the stepped idle cam side? And will I need to buy any gaskets ahead of time?

Step-by-steps anyone?
