Subject: VW Action in the UK

Hello again.

just wanted to say hi - I'm back in Oxford again, from VW Action via
Bristol, which I went to with Sarah and Damon in Splittie. I could have sent
a message from Bristol, but we were beat from the drive and partying Sat
night.  I'd never seen a rave disco at a VW show before, funny about that.   

There are a lot more VWs around than I expected, and there were some nice
buses there.  So many different kinds of campers, Devons and Canterbury
Pitts, and I forget what else in addition to the Dormobiles, which were a
dime a dozen.  The bus in the Jan picture of the NEATO/BK/SSVC calendar was
there, and looked even better in real life, if possible.  Went flatbedding
round the campesite unexpectedly in the back of a 63? single cab and camped
near a very low milage 66ish ambulance that looked great.  my my.  Sarah was
kidding me about my not being more exicted over the customising, but hey
whatever floats your boat.  Let me state here for the record I don't have a
shiny car anyway (even though I do have the correct parts.)  Met another
list member, Lee Griffiths, who wasn't like what I expected. ( and does have
a nice shiny deluxe) We all, for some reason, thought all the list memmbers
were older.   Hard to tell from letters typed on the screen, isn't it. 

 There were lots of neat old bits at the swap, and Sarah was very nice about
letting me put a greasy old 25hp motor in Splittie.  I also found a 6/57 VDO
oil temp guage with the sender that I hope works.

And there was another Brasilia bus at the show, parked near the swap area, a
nice one, not alll rusty this time.  I got a better look at it, and noticed
that the pop out window latches were different.   I told Sarah, but of
course it had moved in the five minutes and she didn't see it.  :(    

Took a while to drive back to Bristol,  and it was nice to be in the back of
a split, and let someone else drive.  But it's very confusing, cause the
doors are on the other side in the back.

Well, that's all for now
