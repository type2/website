Subject: Need a piston for 2.0 

After pulling and tearing down a 2.0 FI engine out of an 81 vangon, I've
discovered that the piston ring grooves on the number 4 piston are cracked and
broken (this would explain the low compression).  The cylinder is good (no
grooves, gouges, etc.)  Does anyone know where I could get a piston?  I don't
want to buy a complete piston set if I don't have to.

Thanks,

Mike
