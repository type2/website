Subject: Re: [T2] Charging Problem

That's still pretty curious Mike. If it has been like this that long,
you should have discharged the battery and been dead in the water long
ago. This scenario only works if a mechanic disconnected it recently
and you have been running on battery power only since then.

On the 77's the alternator wires come up through the tin on the right
side near the heater duct. Then it would go through the tin towards
the front of the vehicle and go to the starter. If it comes from the
starter, it would go to the battery clamp.

My best guess.

I'll be curious to see what you find tomorrow.

 It does look like it would easily reach the positive terminal on the
 battery.  At least it's &quot;memory&quot; position seems to indicate that.  But it
 would also as easily pass through the firewall, too.  I'm not sure how to
 verify if it's connected to the alternator.  Can't see the end of it with
 the tin in the way.  I'll poke around under the bus tomorrow to see if I can
 figure out where it's connected.
 
 Yes, the alternator light seems to glow, at least, most of the time.  Harder
 to see it in the daytime, but it comes on brighter the moment I cut on the
 lights.  Then eventually the lights start to dim, the horn stops working,
 and the run signals stop the moment you hit the brakes.
 
 I've been staying close to home mostly, making a lot of day trips.
 
 You know, it sounds pretty stupid to have put up with this for so long (a
 couple of months).  I am properly chagrined.
