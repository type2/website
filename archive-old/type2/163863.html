Subject: Re: [T2] UPDATE: Re: Vacuum leak check

Just got back from the FLAPS where I picked up a set of points, a
condenser, fuel filter and 2 feet of fuel hose to replace the last
section remaining from a full replacement (I missed the section
between the fuel pump and the fuel rail).  Well despite the fact that
I just set the points a few weeks ago, they closed (almost anyway).
Since it was now running worse than in the morning, I changed the
points and condenser in the parking lot.  I noticed the tab that runs
on the lobes of the distributor shaft was severely worn with the dusty
remains scattered on the shaft and throughout the distributor.  The
new points (Bosch) don't come with lube which really grinds my gears.
I got a dab of motor oil to put on them until I get home.  I put
everything back together and it is running FAR better.  After all the
time I've spent on it lately, I'm getting to know this engine pretty
well - Its not 100%, I don't believe.  Under load, it seems to have
good power and accelerates smoothly now.  I feel highly confident that
I've eliminated the vacuum leaks (the connecting hose from the plastic
tube of the brake boost &quot;Y&quot; to the decel valve and the hose from the S
hose to the Decel both needed to be replaced).  But, I still have an
almost indiscernible hesitation and when I rev the engine in neutral,
the engine breaks up a bit.  It may be backfiring but, its not very
pronounced so its hard to distinguish.  If anyone has any further
suggestions, I'd love to hear them.

Thanks again,
Ken
