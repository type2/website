Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 DP in a 73 Westy, how will it perform?


&gt; Thanks for the info.  I figured it would probably perform similarly to the
&gt; 69 bay that I used to own but wasn't sure if they had changed the gearing
&gt; significantly or not.  The 2.0 I have is in decent shape but for whatever
&gt; reason they want to go with a 1600 that they just built up.  If they
decide
&gt; to purchase it I may end up keeping the 2.0 and selling it separately if
you
&gt; know anyone that's interested.
&gt;
&gt; John
