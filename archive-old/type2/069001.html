Subject: More on bull bars and chunder

Hmm, there does seem to some interest in the bull bar thing.  Michael
Stocker kindly pointed out that there is a picture of the short of thing I
am talking about on the &quot;nice VW Bus page&quot; - point your browser at

http://www.princeton_dot_edu/~sean/

and look at the white post 72 bus in the 'thumbnails'.  This would have to
be an Aussie bus (RHD) with a 'typical' cruisin set-up - bull bar, stone
shield, sun visor and 100w hellas mounted on the vent grille.....

Malcolm Holser also pointed out that  Martin Schneiter Systems, in LA makes
just such a bar, so they could be worth checking out....

I will investigate this a little...I have made them or bought them second
hand - I am not sure if anybody in Aus is still making them 'new' to suit
buses at the moment but I will ask a mate to check out the situation and
report back...

Failing that I will post a 'rough' description on how to fabricate one -
it's really not hard ......last time I did one total cost (including
materials and paying a shop to do the bends - I don't have a pipe bender)
was AUS$50..about $40 US.......


There was also some interest in the line (from the Men-at-work song)
I come from a land down under....
&lt;where women roar and men chunder&gt;......

perhaps as a friday thing people might like to try their hand at
interpreting the cultural meaning of this second line? (as an extra para in
your VW related post of course....)???
