Subject: Engine won't idle after top end rebuild - need help 

&quot;The only other major new items that I replaced were all the mechanical
lifters with hydraulic lifters - to include new pushrods.  I ended up
making my own pushrods and did my best to get them all the same length
per the hydraulic length spec.&quot;

This could be a problem Chris. Are you trying to run hydraulic lifters on a
solid lifter cam? I am no expert on this but I think you need to change
more than just the lifters and pushrods to go to hydraulic... What did you
make you pushrods out of? Why not use stock equipment?

&quot;Once the lifters were pumped up I adjusted the valves to 1.5 turns in
from 0 clearance and this seemed to prevent it from starting.  When I
adjust the valves at .006 in the engines starts and will run as long as
my foot is on the gas. Once the engine is hot it will not start right
away until I let it cool down.&quot;

Again I think your problem lies in the lifters. I would put the solid
lifters back. Replace any damaged or bent pushrods with the correct size
and diameter ones. I am sure someone on the list can hook you up with a
few pushrods for cheap if money is the problem. After that double check all
of your vaccum connections and FI wiring. Also check that your distributor
is installed correctly and you dont have plug wires crossed.
