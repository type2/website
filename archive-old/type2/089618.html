&lt;&lt; Yes it is possible to rebuild a 205 t distributor.  I am going to 
assume (!) it is from a 69-70 bus.  I believe hot vws did an excellent 
tech article about 2 years ago regarding this subject.  As far as the 
basics, cap, rotor, points and condensor order from RMMW or Wolfsburg 
West (if they still sell newer stuff).  Good luck.

Any chance of month and year (or even better) if anyone has the article
any chance of posting to a web site...?
Just thinking in type...With so many 009's around with new parts anyone
with more expertise than I know if any of the parts are common to the
vac. distributors...?
