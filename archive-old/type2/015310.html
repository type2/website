&gt;Hi all,

&gt;    I live in the Northwest and am also looking for a reputable shop to do
&gt;some machine work, any ideas?
&gt;

NW Connecting Rod for machine work. They are in the industrial area south
of Alaska in South Seattle. They do hundreds of VW engines per year and
supply many FLAPS and repair shops in the NW. They will not Californicate
your motor into a boat anchor like so many others.
