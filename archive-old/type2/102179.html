&gt; They said the brakes were soft becuase the rear brakes needed to be
&gt; adjusted.  However, I don't believe this, the brakes harden up on the 2cd
&gt; &quot;pump&quot;, so I don't know how this could be a brake adjustment in the back.

Sure they could.  What is happening is that the rear cylinders aren't
returning all the way after the initial pump, so the brakes seem to be
firming up.  Adjust the rear drums and you will probably be OK.
