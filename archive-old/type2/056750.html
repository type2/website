Robert:

It sounds like you might have a couple of different problems here.  The
first problem you described sounds like the dreaded bucking bus syndrome
(back me up here Fred B.).  I had a very similar symptom (Fred helped me
solve it) and it turned out to be the air flow meter.  I'm assuming you
still have fuel injection.  I'd check out your air flow meter.  Pop the
square plastic cover off of the top of it (might be glued down) and find
the swing arm for the air vane (you can do this with the engine revving to
find it).  On the bottom side of the swing arm are two contacts which rub
on a blackish colored resistive material.  Check along the rub tracks on
this material.  Do you see any white spots along either track indicating
wear-through to the circuit board?  If so, betcha found your problem.  I
don't know what this resistive material is supposed to do, but evidently
it's pretty damn important to your fuel management processor.  You can get
a new/rebuilt air flow meter for less than $200 and replace your existing
unit (its easy), or you can try shifting the loosening the three screws and
shifting the board.  Worked for me!

I think your shifting might be something else, linkage related.  I've no
direct experience here but ya might check the archives.  I do know that
there are a couple of bushings that wear out in the shift linkage which can
cause sloppy shifting and other shift problems.

Good luck,
