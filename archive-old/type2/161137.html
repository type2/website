Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Missing third (?) cylinder

Gary, I doubt he has any fuel injector wiring with
carbs! But what I want to know from you is how did you
solve your FI wiring problem? Did you replace the
entire harness with a used one that will buy some more
time? Did you run new wires?

When mine was so brittle that the insulation kept
breaking off the wires, I replaced it with another
used set that was still flexible - but we must be
coming close to the end of serviceable used FI
harnesses as they all were subjected to pretty much
the same destructive forces - same as the &quot;S&quot; - hose
deterioration and all the vacuum hoses. -BaH

&gt; I was missing on third cylinder with the same

&gt; So, check your fuel injector wiring as well.
