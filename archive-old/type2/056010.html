Subject: RE: fuel injection rough running

I'd do the following before getting too complex:

1. Wiggle all wires and connectors having to do with fuel injection.
Especially grounds, and espeially the ones
    on top of the block under the air distribution manifold. Bad grounds can
create almost any symptom.

2. Replace fuel filter evne if just temporarily with a real cheap one just
as a test.

3. Go to more complex stuff.
