FYI...

We do alot of Porsche work, and the worst gauges I have ever seen were
factory......Even on a car like a 911...

&gt; &gt;Ok..if the general consensus is that the VDO gauges are inaccurate, then
are
&gt; &gt;there any better solutions (without investing a small fortune) or are
they
&gt; &gt;just par for the course?
&gt;
&gt; Is it really important to know the exact temperature or pressure?
&gt; RPM and/or speed (approx.) is/are nice to know. The VDO gauge that
&gt; indicates the oil pressure in my single cab has no scale at all,
&gt; only a red area which is about where the oil light comes on. It tells
&gt; me all I want to know about, I look at the position of the needle, just
&gt; like I would do if it did have a scale. If you want, you can 'calibrate'
&gt; it, like, visit someone who can really tell you the exact temperature
&gt; or pressure, and watch the position of your gauge, just so you know.
&gt; My 3 bar might not be the same as your 3 bar. Mechanical gauges might
&gt; be more accurate.
