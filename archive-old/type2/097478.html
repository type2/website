Subject: Re: [T2] '79 2.0L into '72

&gt; you will have to change the flex plate to a flywheel (Don't forget to
&gt; reset the end play) also will need to use the 72 starter the auto tranny
&gt; uses a different starter

The auto trans self-supporting starter will work perfectly on the 79 engine if
you use the 72 210mm flywheel. It also works with the 74/75 215mm flywheel. It
will NOT work on the 76 and up 228mm flywheel.
If you put in a 76-79 transaxle, then you would need a 228 flywheel and
starter.


&gt; &gt; 5) Install / fit - will the '79 engine bolt right up to the '72 mounts (I
&gt; &gt; think it will..) or will I have to do some fabrication for new engine
mounts
&gt; &gt; etc.
&gt; don't think so.  the rear mount may need some new holes in the frame as I
&gt; think the engine/tranny is longer than the 72 but not sure others I'm sure
&gt; will jump in on this

The engines are the same length. The 76-79 bellhousing is longer. A 79
engine/72 flywheel mated with a 72 trans is the same as a stock 72 set-up.

If this is a 79 Fed version, keep ALL the 79 exhaust parts on the engine. It
looks just like the 72-74 exhaust but the exhaust ports are square.
