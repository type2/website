CONGRATULATIONS,  are you married, and is your SO still on speaking terms
for bringing all &quot;That trash&quot; home

Bob

&gt; back up and ask him if its his bus.  he says yes and
&gt; says the junk man is a comin.   i say whats he giving
&gt; you for it, reply &quot;nothin&quot; to which i respond, well
&gt; ill take it!!  its yours then! awesome!   so if i had
&gt; not left work early, it would have been long gone, if
&gt; i had not stopped to see if the lady needed help i
&gt; would have missed the owner and not saved the bus
&gt; either.   funny how it all works out:)   anyways
&gt; enough friday dribble, the goods are as follows:
&gt; 1968 westy, mid project so its a bit of a mess.   lots
&gt; of wiring needs finishing off and engine is out.  
&gt; heads bad, but lower end new, as in redone crank, new
&gt; pistons and sleeves, and a bus full of parts.   body
&gt; is in rough shape, but passable.   cant wait to dig
&gt; into it and see what ive got.   sorry for the
&gt; rambling, but im pretty stoked.
