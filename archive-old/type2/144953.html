&gt; Following is an extremely amusing excerpt from somebody else's email, that I

&gt; The Engineers at VW thought otherwise. You didn't see people babying the
&gt; type2 when it was new, did you? NO massive Factory
&gt; Recalls, No warnings from the dealer or statements in the owners manual,
&gt; saying:

&gt;  &quot;CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PURCHASE OF YOUR NEW VOLKSWAGEN TYPE 2. NEVER NEVER
&gt; NEVER DRIVE THIS VEHICLE OVER 50MPH, OR WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMP RISES ABOVE 60
&gt; DEG. OR YOU WILL VOID THE WARRANTY, BURN A VALVE, DROP A SEAT, HOLE A
&gt; PISTON, BURST INTO FLAMES, AND DIE A FLAMING DEATH, ALL WHILST HUMMING THE
&gt; HORST WESSEL SONG THAT HAS BEEN SUBLIMINALLY IMPRINTED INTO YOUR
&gt; SUBCONSCIOUS BY OUR SUPERIOR SINGLE SPEAKER SAPPHIRE AM RADIO. HAVE A NICE
&gt; DAY.!!!&quot;

I can give a few reasons for this.

1. The number of lawyers was considerably less than it is now.  Hence, the
number of disclaimers was also less.
2. Warranty periods were shorter.  VW didn't care if your heads packed
it in in 50K miles when the warranty was only 12,500 miles.
3. Brand new engines had all the cooling tin and flaps in place  They
cooled better than the typical engine sold now.
4. The average driver had more common sense.  No car built then would take
being driven uphill on a long 6% grade at WOT on a 104 degree day.
5. Those same drivers would take the claims of &quot;top speed is the cruising
speed&quot; with a grain of salt.


I'm a 60MPH on the flat, 3/4 throttle uphill kind of guy.  On a 400 mile
trip this means that I get another half-hour or so to enjoy driving a bus!
