&gt; Mice have ate holes in the large (foamish seal?) It runs around the engine
&gt; and I believe seals against the tin? My question is what's this (seal?)
called. &gt; I'm trying to order from Ron or whoever but can't find it, I'm
sure it's sold and &gt; I'm just not calling it by it's right name. How far
around does it go, can you
&gt; get it all installed with the engine in? Can you replace just bad parts
that
&gt; you can get to? Is this seal pressure fit or do you use some kinda glue?


I call it an engine compartment seal, part number 411 813 225, $19.95 on my
website for a German one. (You can search by part number, now that you know
it, and order that way.)  It just pushes in; you can do it without removing
anything although you have to be somewhat of a contortionist to squeeze it
around the back.  It is crucial to the cool operation of the engine; if it
is missing or damaged, hot exhaust air can be sucked in by the cooling fan,
increasing the engine operating temperature to deterimental effect.
