Subject: push rod tube seals
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Hello list,

I have a quick question. I know that my 73 bus is
going to need a rebuild soon. The entire engine is
coated in a thick layer of oil. I am startingwith the
baiscs. I just finished building its mono carb. I now
want to replace the push rod tubes and seals. My
question is, does the push rod tube seals come in the
over haul seal  kits that you get to rebuild the
engine? Thank you!

David
