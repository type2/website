Subject: Lost Calif . Registration???

Hello Fellow List People,
Question: In the past month I've acquired (With &quot;Bill of Sale&quot;) two different 
air-pumping VWs.
Problem: Local Calif. DMV gentleman always seems to be quite full of static, 
in that he usually demands in a subtle way (With the DMV &quot;G*d like manner ) 
in that he wants a complete paper trail of previous owners. Impossible to say 
the ...
One is a 58 and the other a 54 or so (Haven't checked the Vin. as yet.)
How have the rest who have had to deal with sort of &quot;Red tape&quot; type attitude 
been able to be successful?
Regard's,
               BOB &amp; MARTHA
