Subject: HELP! Looking for 1700cc head(s)

Can anybody lead me to a good used VW part seller or does anyone have a 
good 1700cc head for sale or for free. I did a couple of Google searches 
and got everything but heads...

I am searching for parts for a friend's engine rebuild. He's a college 
student so the budget is limited.

We pulled the engine down to repair a stripped spark plug hole only to 
discover that the head was cracked as well. The crack runs vertically up 
through the exhaust port.

Am I right to assume that this might lead to a loose valve seat eventually?
