Rob,

Your success with the Continentals is fantastic
considering the price.  How did you know the
Continentals were worth trying?  I know a lot of
German cars use Continentals, I wonder if appropriate
Continentals would be good on Jettas or Audis?  I just
may want to switch from Michelin to Continentals on
some of my cars.  Thanks.

&gt; Greetings,
&gt; 
&gt; Just returned from a 500 mile camping trip to South
&gt; Dakota in my '79 Westy.
&gt; I installed Continental CR21 185R14 tires 2 days
&gt; before I left.  The
&gt; difference was amazing.  I had been running
&gt; passenger car tires and knew
&gt; that there would be an improvement in handling, but
&gt; I had no idea that it
&gt; would be this dramatic.  I drove in 25-30 miles
&gt; crosswinds that use to push
&gt; me around like a sailboat, now they are hardly
&gt; noticeable.  I could even
&gt; drive with 1 hand on the wheel.  They are noticably
&gt; louder, but I can live
&gt; with that.  Tires Plus matched the TireRack's price
&gt; of $45, plus shipping,
&gt; mounting, and valve stems, for a total of $300.  The
&gt; best money I have ever
&gt; spent on my bus. I'm going on a 3 week trip from MN
&gt; to WA/CA/AZ in July and
&gt; feel much safer knowing that I'm riding on these
&gt; tires.
&gt; 
&gt; Just thought I'd pass along my thoughts to anyone
&gt; considering getting the
&gt; &quot;correct&quot; tires for your bus.
