Subject: Bus motor in Thing?

Hey Y'all!
Sorry for the mrginal bus content of this post, but I may have the opportunity to trade this 64 bus I have for a 73 Thing. The thing is (pun intended) that the Thing has no engine, so I would want to use the 40HP currently in the bus for the Thing.  Anyone know if i can put a 40HP engine in a 73 Thing?



Peace, John Baker
