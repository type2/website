Subject: Re: [T2] Gear oil too thick

Don't know for sure about the formula but 2 years ago I almost broke a plastic
hand pump trying to pump the same stuff into my 75 about this time of year.
Put the StaLube jug in a bucket of the hottest tap water you have until the
water starts to cool. Dump the water and refill with hot tap water again for
10-15 min. Should be much easier to pour or pump. Once I got the oil up to
85-90 deg f. the pump worked fine.

  I'm wondering if this thickness is normal or if they've changed the formula
  since the last time I used it.
