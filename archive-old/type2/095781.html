Subject: Size of Oil drain plug

&gt; i have a first question, i need the size (in mm) of the oil drain
&gt;plug so i can buy the correct sender for oil temperature, what i have is
&gt;12mm OD (where the thread is) and about 10mm ID in the hole? any
&gt;suggestions

I suggest the Bus Boys in Redding California, they carry an oil sump plate
with the oil sender already mounted in the hole - not too expensive and less
hassle.
