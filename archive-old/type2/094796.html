Subject: '71 brake question(s)

When I depress the brake pedal, the idle increases.
The pedal 'sticks' about 1&quot; below the normal level after I take my foot off 
the pedal, it does not return to the full up position. If I shut the engine 
off, it returns to the normal, full up, position. In this 1&quot; below position, 
the brakes are dragging slightly, not enough to notice except when testing 
by stopping on a very slight incline (just enough of one that the van would 
barely roll), it does not roll when taking foot off pedal and pedal returns 
to 1&quot; below normal position, but does roll if pedal is then pulled by hand 
to normal position.
The coil return spring looks to be unbroken. Does the plastic ring inside 
this spring tend to deteriorate, reducing the effectiveness of the spring, 
possibly causing this problem?
This problem may have developed since changing the brake hoses.
Doesn't seem a good idea to be driving around w the brakes dragging, even a 
little, any suggestions appreciated.
Thanks
Best wishes
Denny Johnson
