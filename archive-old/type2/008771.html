&gt; I've been having a rich fuel mixture problem.  Tested all components of FI
&gt; including swapping out control unit (spare) and still showing 850-950 mvdc
&gt; on a O2 sensor I welded to the driver side exhaust manifold to heat
&gt; exchanger elbow.

Are you absolutly sure that non of your injectors ar leaking?  What
about the cold start injector?  I had the cold start injector leak
on me.  What I did to test it was run the engine and get it hot, then 
, leaving the injector in place, plumb around it with a piece 
of metal pipe.  Start up the engine and let it get warm again and 
then run the test again.
