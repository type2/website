There are two places you can look for VINs.( Model #231 is a Kombi w/
Cargo doors right, left hand drive.)

First; on the right hand side of the fresh air vent toward the front
windsheild is a rivited &amp; stamped VIN plate.  
Second; in the engine compartment

And third:      also look behind the passenger seat.  On  circa Oct 58 an
later buses (most of them, there have been some exceptions noted) there is the
M code tag, which bears the VIN, date of manufacture, original colour, options
it came with,  and all kinds of groovy stuff. You can look up how to decipher
it on the NEATO webpage.
