Subject: [T2] Looking for a VW Garage in Midwestern Cities

Hi folks!

I'm planning to relocate to the mid west next year, and I'm checking out 3 
cities and would like to know if each of these cities has a good reputable VW 
Mechanic who I can rely on for my bigger repair needs.

The cities include:

Columbus, Ohio
Madison, Wisconsin
Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota

Thanks!
