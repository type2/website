&gt; The fuel pump was triggered by an oil pressure switch that had failed on.
&gt; So I was going nuts trying to figure out why I had to replace the
&gt; needle and seat valve every 2 weeks. Once I found it I wired it to a
&gt; relay triggered by the coil + side. Never had a problem after that,
&gt; though a stall would leave the pump running...

I'll be combining the two.

Relay solenoid (+) will come from coil (+)

Relay (-) wil be connected to oil pressure idiot light sender. 

Key will have to be on AND OP sender failed closed to leave the pump
running when the engine isn't. 

That's the quick simple fix. I'll probably investigate a coil (-) fired
setup later.

And considering the fluke accident that ate my engine last time I'm
probably going to add a level of complexity to the VW design and set up a
coil power cutout using the OP sender. Oil pressure goes away and the
engine dies -- immediately.
