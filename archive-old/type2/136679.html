Subject: An Idiot in need of help.

I had a brain fart the other day when trying to jump start my bus. I ended
up reversing the polarity. I checked it twice before connecting the cables
and was wrong both times. UGH.

 

So it went like this for about 30 seconds until I noticed smoke coming from
the jumper cables and the engine compartment of my bus. I pulled off the
jumper cables as fast as I could (very hot).

 

Fixing the polarity, I was able to get the bus started, but it died almost
immediately. The battery had nothing left and was on its last leg anyway.

 

So, I bought a new battery, put it in and the bus fired up and ran like a
champ. BUT. the battery and ERG lights are on. This tells me that I likely
fried the alternator. After a little more investigation, I also noticed
neither headlight works (but parking lights &amp; Hazards do) and the radio
doesn't work. The wipers also only move very slowly.

 

So, once you quit laughing at my stupidity, I was hoping some of you may
have suggestions as to the possible extent of the damage I caused. Any
guesses or first-hand knowledge welcome.

 

Thanks,

 

Troy
