Subject: Re: [T2] alt/regulator troubles

&gt; &gt;I test voltage at the regulator and get 12.2.  I test voltage at the coil
&gt; &gt;and get 6.5 to 7.3.  Additionally, the right turn signal blinks very
&gt; &gt;quickly.  The left blinks nor
&gt;
&gt; Should be closer to 14 volts I believe. You may have a bad regulator or bad
&gt; wiring to the regulator.

And if that is the ignition side of the coil there is an awful lot of
voltage dropping somewhere. Its a long trip from back o bus - headlight
switch - ignition switch - coil.
