Subject: Re: [T2] cargo door

Do you mean the mechanism in the rear?  I've tried a little grease in the track.  Thanks...KR

it just seemed to want to 'lock' before the door
was fully closed, then rattle ...

Cleaning and lubricating the mechanism did the trick 
for me.

&gt;  Hey, Guys (and Gals), I'm having trouble with my Cargo door. I've  adjusted the front catch before but now it is latching before the rear  of the door settles into the closed position. I have to hold one hand  on the back and push to get it to seat. I don't see any adjustment on  the rear mechanism. Anybody know how to adjust it or have I bent  something. Thanks...KR
