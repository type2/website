&gt; 185/70R14 on my 1975 Westy thanks to the PO.  so, i bought 4 new

&gt; 
&gt; well, they arrived (in lightening speed i might add) yesterday.  so, i'm 
&gt; looking at the old tire and the new tire.  the old one (185/70R14) is much 
&gt; wider of a tread than the new ones i just bought (185R14.)

the old ones are 70 series tires, (185/70R14)
                                       ^^
this means they have a different height to width ratio....they should fit
the same rims with no problem.

personally I like the 70 series tires and always use em but that is a
personal preference
