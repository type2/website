&gt; More questions...my engines is out and the clutch is apart.  My &quot;clutch
&gt; failure&quot; was actually due to a melted pilot bearing which sort of welded the
&gt; input shaft to the crankshaft.  I noticed the input shaft has a little bit
&gt; of radial play...is this normal or acceptable?  The tranny worked fine prior
&gt; to clutch problem.

Normal.  The input shaft is on splines inside the transmission and has a
bit of play.

&gt; Also, my clutch plate looks ok but is worn to about 2/16&quot; above the rivets.
&gt; The book says the minimum is 1/16&quot;  I can't find a spec for what a new
&gt; clutch plate would have.  Should I buy a new clutch plate?  How much life
&gt; might be left in my old clutch plate?

I tend to think that &quot;when in doubt, replace the disk.&quot;  I probably
replace them too often, but I've never worn one out and had to pull the
engine to replace it.  When installing the pressure plate, a
mini-mag-light flashlight makes a perfect pilot tool.

&gt; The flywheel and pressure plate look and feel smooth...is it good practice
&gt; to re-use these parts based on smoothness?

Works for me.  If the clutch was smooth before the pilot bearing problem
then the surfaces are probably fine.
