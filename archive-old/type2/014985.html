Subject: Single carb connectors to intake manifold
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.1.32.19990628080440.0068e2d8_at_pop.mindspring_dot_com&gt;

I need to buy the rubber connectors that go from the
base of the single carb to the 4 intake runners.  I've called
a few parts places, but they want a part number.  Does anyone
have the part number so I can order these parts?

BTW, these are for a '72 bus, type 4 engine with the single
carb conversion.

Thanks,
Dave
