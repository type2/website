I've got a used one I'm planning to put on someday. I noticed it's about 50%
plugged. I wonder if a person could just clean out the end? It looks like most
of the plugging is just built up on the inlet end. I'd think a blast with a sand
blaster would clean off the deposits and open it back up. Ever hear of anyone
doing that?

&gt; It passed with no problem. I have no explaination on why the HC went up, but
&gt; it was still below the max allowable. This should fix you Vanagon also. $125
&gt; well spent.......
