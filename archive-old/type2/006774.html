If you very lightly lubricate the cups and the slotted bolt then they
turn very easily.  I believe that there is a special high temperature
grease for this purpose.  I never used it.  I just put a very thin
coat of bearing grease in the cup and on the threads.  And I live in
the salt country.

Never had any problems with stuck adjusters or grease on the drums.

&gt;I ordered some stars a while back, and I wonder why
&gt;some of the new ones are brass as opposed to steel.  I
&gt;assume the brass does not corrode into the holes as
&gt;easily, but I would think that the brass would get
&gt;chewed up when trying to adjust them, or if they got
&gt;lodged in the holes.  Are there any new ones that are
&gt;not brass?  Most websites I look at either don't show
&gt;pictures, or you can't tell whether its brass or
&gt;steel.  Just wondering
&gt;
