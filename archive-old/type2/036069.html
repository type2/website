Subject: Good VW shop in Las Vegas

Volks,

Today I retrieved Bluto from the shop for the first time ever in 12 years
of ownership.  I had all four ball joints in the front end replaced, and
also had the Pitman Arm pin (I think that's it's name) rebushed.

The bushing kit I had bought from RMMW some time ago with the intention of
doing it myself, but it was one of those &quot;bad jobs&quot; which I did many years
ago and didn't really want to repeat.  I have also heard many horror
stories about the ball joints on this list so I didn't want to do that job
either.  Meyers told me that they have to remove the torsion bars in order
to replace the ball joints!

Two other reasons I farmed the work out - one is that I have no garage or
even driveway here in Las Vegas, and only a minimal set of tools, AND there
is a great VW shop here in town called Meyers Foreign (702-457-2966 3552
Boulder Hwy) which I have visited a few times in the last couple of months
to gather impressions, all of which were good.

I am happy to report that Meyers appears to have done a great job on my
bus.  They did the work in one day, and did it for the price promised.
They even used synthetic grease in the axle.  The play in the steering is
90% gone and the bus is much more stable on the highway.  I'm a happy
camper.  :)

If anyone needs VW service or parts in the Las Vegas area, Meyers gets the
nod from me.
