Subject: Re: [T2] Gas tank for 78 Westy

If you have rust particles in the tank it will clog your fuel filter when
you start to get low on gas and is noticealbe when you try to climb hills,
especially. That seems to be your case.

Rather than buying a new tank (if you can even find it), search for a decent
used tank from the junk yard (make sure it is a late tank if you are still
running fuel injection) and take it to a radiator shop and have them &quot;boil&quot;
it which will clean it better than you can at home. POR-15 also makes a gas
tank kit and you can do that after it is boiled so it will last you a long
time.

Having a good one ready to swap in will keep your &quot;down time&quot; to one weekend
or less and you will have a spare to clean or sale to get some $ back.
