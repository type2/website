Subject: VDO mounting

Hi Folks,

I don't mean to interrupt the discussion of relationships, but I have a 
bus-related question.

Today I was out installing a VDO oil temp gauge, a long-delayed 
project.  I'd picked up this gauge and an rubber under-dash mounting 
panel last year from BD, but I've been procrastinating until I had some 
alternative transportation in case things went south, as they often do 
when I mess with the wires.  Today, though, the wiring went fine, all 
the volts ending up in the right place.  Then I screwed the mounting 
panel to the underside of the dash to the left of the steering column.  
Yuck.  Can this be right, all those wires sticking out the back and 
looking rather tacky?

It's just not the neat installation I somehow pictured.   So the 
questions are these:
* Did I get this thing upside-down or something?
* If this is really the way it's supposed to look, has anyone come up 
with a way to make it &quot;neater&quot;, like some sort of sleeve around the 
exposed mess at the back?
* If I forget that mounting bracket altogether, has anyone done a nice 
single-gauge install elsewhere on the dash?  (I like the 3-gauge 
mounting setup under the radio but only want to do the single gauge; 
and let's not get into that, okay?  Ditto the &quot;should have bought 
another brand&quot; suggestions.)

Thanks for your ideas (plus what's in the archives).

See you on the road,
Jerry
