&gt;&gt;If true, why does the camper use the solid regular 120v solid copper
house wiring from the outside input to the inside outlet? (and to the
converter for the fridge?)

&gt;Convenience? Another problem with solid copper wire is that it gets brittle 
with age.

My feeling: bad practice!  I don't know about latter-day VW wiring, but the 
earlier buses and bugs used un-tinned, stranded copper wire.  It corroded 
quickly inside the crimp lugs, resulting in voltage losses, especially if 
moisture was present. 

Dim headlights made it easy to identify on-coming VWs :-((

It's not difficult to obtain #14 tinned, stranded wire; it's just a bit more 
expensive than solid, untinned.  FWIW older cars, even British cars, were wired 
with stranded wire -- soldered where we now see crimp-connexions.  Surely a 
matter of &quot;value engineering&quot; since the problems do not surface until a couple 
of years have elapsed and the warranty has timed-out.
