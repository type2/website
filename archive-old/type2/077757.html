Subject: ADMIN:  nice on the list - kill this thread

Hi guys,
While I appreciate the concerns behind this thread, I'm killing it now
before it turns into a giant flame-fest.  If you continue to post on this
thread, you will have your list access removed.

As for the issue at hand, while you certainly don't have to like everyone on
the list, you at least have to be civil to them on the list.  This public
venue is not the place for flames.

If you absolutely must express your unpleasant feelings to someone else, do
it via private e-mail, but please don't be abusive because the corollary to
this rule is below:

If a fellow listmember is sending you abusive/obscene/threatening/etc
e-mails, please let one of the list administrators know and we will be happy
to do what we can to remove psychos from our community.

Thanks,

Sean Bartnik
