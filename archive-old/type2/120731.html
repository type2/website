Subject: Bad hydraulic lifters (rant)

If you just got a rebuilt 2.0 motor from AVP or anyone else, just a word of advice : check the hydraulic lifters.

After months of trouble, and bad compression, I finally bit the bullet and pulled my one year old 1200 mile AVP engine and took off the heads.

Guess what : the intake lifter on cylinder #3 was as solid as a rock. The cylinder wall and head were black with soot.

The other lifters had varying degrees of compressibility.

Someone at a local VW shop had told me about bad hydraulic lifters in type 4 engines and this confirms it. I believe that Boston Bob had an article about it too.

I bought a replacement set of lifters from CB Performance (their so called high speed ones) and hope that those will run better.

The bad news is that Leonard at AVP refused to honor the warranty, citing that the engine heat tabs had fallen off which, IMHO, is yet another chicken and egg story : would that had happened if the hydraulic lifters were good?

Moral of the story is : if you want the job done right, do it yourself. You might have to do it twice and spend twice the money, but it will be done right.

In any case, if you are dealing with a hydraulic motor and don't want to do it yourself, make sure that you ask if the vendor is using new OEM lifters or rebuilt ones.
