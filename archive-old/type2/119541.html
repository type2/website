Subject: Re: [T2] campmoblie for sale

Sitting for 5 years can create a rats nest of problems--
Is this Bus an automatic or stick?
Seals can dry up on the automatic and cause all kinds of problems--the
clutch in a stick set up can be froze--
The brake system can possibly be all froze up--and / or junk-- 
Does the engne spin free--??--By hand anyway--
Rust is the biggest issue on the whole Bus--especially where it's
geographicly located, unless it's been inside all this time--this alone
can help the situation--
If it's been outside all this time Verin coud have set up housekeeping
and boy--can they make a mess out of the wiring and interior--  

What kind of condition is the vehicle overall??

This would be a good indicator of what you should be doing here--

500 bucks can buy you 5000 dollars of aggravation real quick.

Take your time and do some groaping around for awhile on the Bus-

If you have a bunch of time and some liquid cash--it might be a good
deal-


Good Luck-,
