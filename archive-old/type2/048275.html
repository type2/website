Hi volks,

Darrin K. Pierce sends:

&gt; Just curious.  Is there a big difference between names brands of shocks?
&gt; Bilstein and KYB claim to improve the handling and wind veering of the
bus,
&gt; but I'd like to hear some more about it from people that know.

Jim Mowreader responds:

&gt; You get wind veering in a campmobile (whatever kind you have) because
you're
&gt; driving a sail. You could have the greatest suspension in the world, and
&gt; that's not going to change the fact that you also have around 100 square
&gt; feet of area on each side of the Bus.

 This doesn't tie in with my experience. While it's true that a bus will 
always be sensitive to crosswinds, for the reasons you give, I have found
that upgrading shocks does help to reduce the effect. I think it's because
the shocks resist the tipping force of the wind when a gust hits. They
don't help with a steady crosswind but they do help with gusts and 
&quot;truckwash&quot;. The extra damping makes the bus more stable, too, so it's 
easier to correct the effects of a gust.

&gt; Handling's a different story, and good shocks will help there. It would
help
&gt; more if you used a bigger swaybar (or a swaybar at all in the back, if
such
&gt; there be) but good shocks will help.

 True again- this will further reduce the tipping effect.

 Quality varies- the stock bus shocks will wear out after 60-80K (give or
take) whereas aftermarket ones can be more durable (Bilstein?) or less
(Cofap?). FWIW the shocks on my '77 were shot when I bought it at 77K, 
whereas the Bilstein's on my 911 are fine at 122K (Good thing too at
$565 a set from an independent...!).

 I'm currently running the KYB's on my bus- they offer better stability
than stock but the ride is substantially firmer (bear in mind that the
shocks are right under your seat- anything the suspension doesn't soak
up goes straight up your spine!). If you are at all concerned about 
ride quality, or don't particularly need better dynamics (a well-damped
bus wallows less on bumpy roads) then I'd recommend doing anti-roll
(sway) bars first, then stiff tyres (load-range-D style Commercial
Vehicle rubber). If you still want more, then look into HD shocks.

Cheers,
	  W.
