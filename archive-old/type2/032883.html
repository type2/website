&gt;Okay, this is the second thread that I've seen this in:  I give up.
&gt;What does DM stand for?
&gt;(?Data Management?)
&gt;Jonathan M. Smith

It stands for _Dogmatic_Mechanic_ ...a special breed of mechanic who has
the ability to look back 30 years and peer into the minds of German
engineers and &quot;see&quot; their intentions and ideas .... :-) Just joking... I'm
sure the fellow who is always splaying about this term will correct me on
my misinterpretation because that's VERY DM..which is something we are
supposed to want to emulate.
