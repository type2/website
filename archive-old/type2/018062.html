WRT the continuity from ground to the alternator.
This one stumped me as well.
It has to do with the diodes that are in the alternator and the tiny
amount of voltage in your multimeter.
If you check the alternator w/ the positive lead on the body of the
alternator (ground)  and the negative lead to the alternator cable, you
should get 0 continuity.
If you connect the positive multimeter lead to the alt cable, and the
negative multimeter lead to the body of the alternator, then you should
get a blip on the multimeter that will go to 0 continuity (may depend on
the strength of your multimeter?)  

This confused the hell out of me until I realized I was not consistantly
testing the alternator w/ the same leads to the same points.

hope this helps

I have continuity (about 50% on my ohm meter) between my positive
battery cable and the chassis
of the bus. When I remove the big cable from the alternator (at the
starter); I no longer have
this problem. I just inspected the cable today and it's not broken. This
is the alternator I
had tested this morning and it works fine. I have the continuity with or
without the plug into
the voltage regulator...and regardless of what other wires are connected
or disconnected.

I thought this meant that I had a dead short in my alternator, but I
don't think it would have
passed the alternator test on the test stand if that were true.

I'm really stumped on this one. Any ideas, theoretical or practical
would be appreciated.

Thanks! Joe
