Russ,

I'm assuming the original poster was thinking like me - in other words, thinking of a way to run the A/C with the engine off.  A 110V electric motor of sufficient size should be able to drive the compressor while parked (at a campground, with electricity say) if the mechanical problems could be eliminated (like how to easily switch the compressor drive over to the electric motor from the engine and vice versa).


&gt;The power to get a motor started is not usually thought of in terms of
&gt;horsepower, but rather, the torque the motor must produce and the resulting
&gt;current it must draw, in order to break away from stop and accelerate to
&gt;rated speed. This starting current can be expected to be in the range of 2
&gt;to 3 times the rated full load current for a DC motor, higher (like, 6 times
&gt;full load current) for an AC induction motor). 

But not for a mechanical device like an A/C compressor.  The inductive load of the  driving motor is not a concern since there is (presumably) plenty of power available for it (again, assuming 110V source).  Fortunately, electric motors make their maximum torque at or near 0 rpm and are thus well-suited to handle any startup requirements of the compressor, assuming they can also turn it at a reasonable rpm.

I think it's do-able, and some day I will make a serious effort to get it working.  I already acquired a 220V (oops) 3/4hp motor at a swap meet for experimentation, but I think it is likely too small.
