Replacement is easy, remove the nuts that hold the fuel ring halves to
the intake manifolds, pop the old ones off, pop the new one on.  The
important point is to be sure the injectors are sitting square to the
manifold openings when you reassemble, as the injector-manifold seals will
not seal if the injector is misaligned and the ring will *not* pull it
square!

As someone else said, it amazes me that you could get the short sections
of fuel hose replaced with the injectors in place!!!  This is *much*
easier to do with the injectors off the bus!
