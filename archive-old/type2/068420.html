Subject: FREE 6 to 12V inverter (&amp; CONTEST!)

My dad recently retired, and while helping him clean up his office last
weekend, I came across a 6 to 12V &quot;inverter&quot; (isn't it actually a
transformer?) he bought for our old beloved 1957 beetle.  The &quot;inverter&quot; is
designed to be mounted under the dash, and allows one to operate 12V
components (like radios, CD players, blenders...) in a 6V vehicle.  Kinda
neat.

I got it for free, I can't use it, so the Universal Law dictates that I
most give it away to the Most Deserving.  For free.  I'll even foot the
postage if it's under ten bucks.  Really.  I'm hoping some of the splittie
folks could put it to good use in their bus, and that would make me happy.

Here's what I have:
- - It's a Tenna &quot;Ranger&quot; inverter Model R1-1
  &quot;This apparatus converts 6 volt DC to 12 volt DC.&quot;
- - Output 12VDC, 2 amps, negative ground, made in Japan.
- - Still in box, still in original plastic bag, with original instructions.
  Schematic included.
- - Includes this note in the &quot;owners guide&quot;: &quot;The resistors and capacitors used
  in this unit are of standard values and are readily available through local
  electonic parts outlets.&quot;
- - Can't find a date on it anywhere, probably early 70s, possibly earlier.
- - Size: 11.3 cm wide x 4.7 cm high x 7.1 cm deep.  Horizontal mounting bracket
  extends width to 14.0 cm overall.
- - The box smells faintly of acetic acid.  The &quot;inverter&quot; itself does not
seem to
  smell, so I think it's ok.  I have not checked the operation of the unit.

Here's the deal (PLEASE READ!):
It really is free.  Since I expect more than one person on the list may be
interested, I'll add a bit of fun to the recipient selection process.
    I'll send it to the person who posts the BEST VW BUS LULLABY to the
list on Friday November 15, 1996.  Christa and I are expecting our first
child in a few months, and I want to expose him/her to positive influences
early!  Here are some guidelines:

- - VW bus content in the lyrics is obligatory.
- - Lullabies telling a cohesive VW bus story score extra points.
- - Adaptations of well-known existing (non-VW) lullabies are encouraged, since
  I'll have to learn to sing them.
- - Assuming there is more than one submission, the winner will be judged by me,
  Christa, and Glen &amp; Caron &lt;gbuhlman_at_direct_dot_ca&gt;.  Christa and I control 51% of
  the voting block, so in the case of disagreement, our vote carries.  :-)
- - If you don't want a stupid inverter, you can still submit lullabies--just
make
  it clear in your post you don't want it so we don't select you as the
winner.
- - No need to post s-mail addresses to the list.  I will contact the winner and
  will obtain a mailing address via private email.
* Post your lullabies ONLY on FRIDAY.  Please post using the subject heading:
  &quot;[F] VW LULLABY CONTEST&quot;
- - Having fun is obligatory.  Those caught not having fun will be rounded up and
  punished severely.

To start this contest off, here's an example of a VW bus lullaby.  Sure,
the diagnostic procedures are missing, and the course of action is a bit
weird, but hey, the kid's not going to be working on my bus for a few years
yet, so what's the harm?  :-)

Sung to the tune of &quot;Hush little baby don't you cry...&quot;

Hush little baby don't you fuss,
  Daddy's gonna buy you a splittie bus.
And if that splittie bus don't start,
  Daddy's gonna buy you a rebuilt part.
And if that rebuilt part don't fit,
  Daddy's gonna dis-as-semble it.
And if that part can't be repaired,
  Daddy'll buy a new one, don't be scared.
