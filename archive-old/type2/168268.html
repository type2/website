Subject: Re: [T2] Flux Core Welding Problems

I was playing with my welder last night and found that it does have a gas
hose connected within the line. I attached a replacement hose I purchased a
while ago that would connect to the tank, but now I do not know where to go.

Do I need to purchase a tank and then fill it? Where might I get one? I saw
one at Harbor Freight, but the tank was $79! And that was still empty!

Since it seems that the gas portion of welding with my MIG is no more a
difficult setup than it currently is without gas, I figured I would like to
try it - especially if it gives me deeper welds - in theory.

Lastly, what type of wire would I need to change to since it seems that
flux-core is supposed to provide the same benefit of welding with gas?

I'll have to stop at Harbor Freight again and see what else they have - but
any suggestions would be helpful.

And Jon, What you are saying makes sense since that is exactly how the
effects of zinc burn-off are described on that page Karl sent.
