&lt;&lt; the other day someone on another list i am on suggested that if you need to
bend brake lines by hand, you should fill them with sand first so they don't
kink. i wondered (to myself) if they were serious.

Yes...But make sure the lines are surgical clean afterwards or you'll be
replacing slave cylinders...There's another old way to bend tubing (con-
duit or other)...I've got a box full of tightly wound springs that fit var-
ious size tubes...Slip 'em on and bend without kinking (Just ask Ray 
Davies...;-)
