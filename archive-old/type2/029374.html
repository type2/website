It was pondered :
&gt;What is, in your opinion, the most useful, indespensible, 'changed your
&gt;life after you started using it' tool, for working on VW Campers? It
&gt;doesn't have to be big, expensive, complicated or hard-to-find. Just the
&gt;tool that is 'brilliant'. 

Without a doubt, I would say that is was my $20 cheapo 4 1/2 inch
grinder. In the days BG (before grinder) I would spend hours
sanding, chemical treating, chipping, and working at rust with
an ineffectual drill run wire brush. Then, I bought the grinder and
a 4 1/2 inch Makita knotted wire wheel. Rust doesn't even come near
the bus any more, it lives in fear of my 10,000 RPM might!
(Get the cheap grinder, but not the cheap wheels. $5 'saved'
on the wheel will mean you use 4 of them for every $10 Makita wheel)
Grease the grinder gear box every year, and let fly! It is nice
to be able to eat paint or rust faster than a sand blaster,
and nothing gets in its way. 

Try it, you'll like it.

(Ok, the second favorite tool is the Wife(tm). Imagine
having 4 arms....)
