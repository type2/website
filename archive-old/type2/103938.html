&gt; &gt; &gt;Go in when they are not busy or rushed and they will likely take better

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A DMV that isnt busy?? Is there such a thing??
&gt; &gt;Ive never gone into the DMV here in Las Vegas and waited less than 2 hours.
&gt;
&gt; Get out of town, where there's less %_at_#&amp;!!! people.  Would you drive a half
&gt; hour to save two hours standing in line?  I do.

Get a map out and check the distance from Las Vegas to the &quot;next town&quot;
with a DMV office.  A list of offices can be found here:
