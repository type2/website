Karen,

Thumbs down.

Depends on the money, but with the amount of body missing to rust that 
they show, you are going to find even more...and none of it is cheap to 
fix(and paint).  

Are you wanting to just drive it? or drive it and do body work as well?

And I doubt that you will cruise at 75-80.....more like 60-65 maxed out.
That model has reduction gears on each rear wheel.  75-80 might be 5,000 
rpm on an engine....and that's not good on a type 1 engine like that bus 
has.

Save your money and get a good bay window...you'll be happier!

My wife sold her 67 this year, her opinion of the difference between her 
splitty(that she loved) and a late model bay was &quot;wow!&quot; for the bay 
window.  Easier to drive, better brakes and more power.....and you can 
find some with far less rust than the 66!

How about this one?...justthe first I saw that looked decent...doesn't 
mean it is.

&gt;  OK, you guys are starting to worry me now... Please go to www.thesamba_dot_com.
&gt; Find the 66 dual port camper-style bus posted on Jan.14th from Jerome, Idaho
&gt;  and tell me what you think...
&gt; 
&gt; Thumbs up... or thumbs down.
 I'm planning on getting it today if the money comes in...
 But, if it has rust in places that will be hard to fix, I need to know.
&gt; 
&gt; Tell me what you think , and get back to me asap...
&gt; Thanks...
