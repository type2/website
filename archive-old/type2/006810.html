Subject: Re: [T2] Stud removal

Well, the head is in the industrious and well seasoned
hands of two people in the tool room at work. I brought
it in and my buddy welded a nut on each of the broken
studs (three of them) and only one came out. Tomorrow 
we will try again, and if that doesn't work, it's down
to milling them out. I trust them, as they have about 
60 years experience between the two of them....
