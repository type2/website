Subject: [T2] VW Switch Wanted

Hello all,
I am trying to locate one of the VW interior light switches.  This is a
push-pull switch that mounts on the dashboard and controls the rear interior
light in early bay-window Buses.  I'd like to get the switch and make sure
it's also got the little light icon insert in it.

My intent is to install a rear fog light and use this simple off/on switch
to control it, thereby maintaining the stock look of the dash.  BTW, whoever
mentioned checking behind the dash for other switch cutouts in the metal was
right on.  There is one to the right of the headlight switch in my '79.
That's where the fresh air fan switch would have gone had the van been so
equipped.  All I need to do is make a corresponding hole in the vinyl dash.

So, looking for the switch, the knob, the knob insert, and the little screw
thing that holds the switch to the dash.  Let me know what you want for it.

Also, does anyone know where to get an externally mountable rear fog light?
I haven't had a lot of luck finding them but I know they are out there.

Thanks,
