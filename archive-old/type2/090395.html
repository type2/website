yes hopefully the filter is just nice an clogged now. You should also
check out the temp sensor II which should be on the 3/4 head. This is
the little wire coming off a bolt looking thing right next to the #3
intake runner. Check to see if it's tight, if not loose then check it
per bentley. these damn things cause many goofy problems w/ FI (but at
least it's easy to fix :)
