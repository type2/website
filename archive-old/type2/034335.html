&gt; Well it's not really a vacuum hose, it's more of a pressure hose.  There
&gt; is not supposed to be a PCV valve.  There is supposed to be a hose from
&gt; the crankcase breather on the case and that hose is supposed to go into
&gt; the air cleaner, so the crankcase fumes are vented to the air cleaner for
&gt; burning.

so do I need a filter on that hose? Also if I plug the current hose that
goes to the &quot;intake manifold&quot; (what the carb sits on) the van dies. Any idea
why? Is the hose from the brake booster supposed to be going there? There is
a &quot;T&quot; fitting on the &quot;manifold&quot; and the booster and the crank case hose both
go there. If I take the case hose off and plug the fitting, the van is not
going to run.
