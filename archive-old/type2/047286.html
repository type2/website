Subject: [T2] can't idle below 1700

the only thing that I can think of with what I know from my email is-        
Is your idle air control valve completely closed off?  This is the big screw 
on the left side of the carb. The way these carbs are designed is the 
butterfly valve is completely closed at an idle and the engine gets its air 
from the idle air control valve so if the valve is closed at the factory and 
never got opened the engine will not run untill the butterfly valve is opened 
 to pull enough air over the venture. I hope I can help but I have only 
messed with this type of carb since spring of 2000.  Good luck!!!!!
