Luc,

        Go to Radio Shack. The have noise suppresser there. If you tell them the
exact prob., They can offer up a few choices. Incidentally, That is where I used
to work, just to add myself into the &quot;employment&quot; thread. I am currently
unemployed in the Adirondack Mountains of New York. There are a few other
choices, but that is the easiest.

Good luck,
Nathaniel

&gt; How can I isolate the bn4 circuit from the radio circuit.  I ear the
&gt; constant frying noise of the spark plug comming out the the radio while the
&gt; heater is operating.  For now, both the main power and the switch power are
&gt; connected on the batery all the time ( circuit number 30) and each one as a
&gt; fuse on it.
&gt;
&gt; My engine as 4 sparkplugs and My radio is very good.  I dont see any special
&gt; device between the coil and the buse box!
&gt;
&gt; any suggestions?
