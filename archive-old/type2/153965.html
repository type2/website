Subject: Re: [T2] Pics of the dangers of a front mounted spare

I recently purchased my bus and it has had a few dents and dings on it. The
PO didn't give me the key for the spare tire on the front of the bus. I did
notice that it made creaky noises while I drove and attributed that noise to
a loose bolt holding the carrier in place.

Well, I finally got the spare tire off and sadly I have to report that the
sheet metal around the bolt holes has ripped in multiple directions. I am
not about to reskin the front nose but know that I will have to remove paint
inside and out to braze the tears. Bummer! SO, that is another bad deal
about a spare tire mounted on the nose.

My buddies all have their spares loaded in the top luggage carrier.

Chris
