&gt; Hey Tony,
&gt; If thats the Front Beam you got from me back in 1999 in Long Island City, I
&gt; can tell you I pulled
&gt; it out of a 1973 bus that had been sitting in someone's driveway for years
&gt; in Franklin Square LI.
&gt; 
   'Fraid not...That beam went to another Bus...:-)

This one was from a &quot;project&quot; Bus that sat in a 
garage for years. I was waiting at a light one day
and a couple came up to the driver's window and
said, &quot;Do you want another one?&quot;
Story was the couple's kid had gotten the Bus years
ago and was &quot;workin' &quot; on it and then got bored or
whatever...The Bus was rolled out of the garage and
Dad said, &quot;End of the month...Either the Bus goes
mobile or the Bus goes.&quot;
The kid decided he didn't want the Bus anymore, and
I had it towed to my house...Sat in the back for about
two years and I was thinkin' about puttin' my engine
in it when a tree limb made the decision for me. My
front beam had been welded but started to crack a-
gain so I pulled the beam from the (now) donor Bus
and it's at my buddy's shop being cleaned and prep-
ped to go on the runner... :-)
