The main problem with this is that you will need to make the wood
(probably masonite) fairly thick (1/4 inch?) to prevent the dreaded
buzzing.  this is what I did with a D*tsun 510 with door panels similar to
the VW.  It worked great, but fabbing the door panels and covering them
was more than a notion.
