Dear Chris,

The '63-'67 Transporter and the '68-'79 Bus are both on the list for CD-ROMs
late next year. And yes these CDs  will have color wiring diagrams in them
whenever there are original color diagrams available. I shall gladly contact
you via email when either of these manuals is available. As always please
feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.

Thank you,


Michael Shellenberger
