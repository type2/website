Subject: Fuel Pressure Check

My bus has been having an intermittant starting problem, and after checking various things, I am beginning to suspect the fuel pump or regulator.  It seems as though it is taking a while to build pressure. 
The local FLAPs don't sell a fuel pressure tester that will work on my '78 Westfalia (threaded connection too small on the rail) Is there a way that I can use these testers ( I think they are ACTRON brand), or is there another way to see what my pressure is?  Is the test port a NPT thread?  
Also, I want to replace all of the fuel lines.  I remember that there was a post a while back that a guy sells all the hose needed in a kit.  What was his name?  Many thanks,
Greg
