&gt;Hi David, I came upon your page following links from type2_dot_com. You have
&gt;some busted links there by the way...
&gt;I am looking for info on transmissions. I have a 78 Camper that probably
&gt;has 200K on the tranny. It is crunching in almost all the gears now, but
&gt;hasn't started popping out yet. I need to replace it at some point. I have
&gt;a recently rebuilt stock engine in the bus and I am looking either to
&gt;change ratios or put a five-speed in it. I am considering two options for a
&gt;five-speed. Gene Berg makes 5-speed 090 transmission, but he legthens the
&gt;transmission to do it which would require some customization of the mounts
&gt;and shift rods. I also see that some Vanagons had five-speeds as well. Will
&gt;a Vanagon transmission go into my 78?
&gt;I realize you may not be able to answer my question, but can you refer to
&gt;someone who can? Thanks for the help.
&gt;
