&gt;Greetings. Was wondering what the expected life span (MTBF) of a rebuilt 
&gt;Bosch 55amp. alt. was. Put one in my ' 78 Westy four months ago, and just 
&gt;lost one of the three diodes in the pack today. The original alt. lasted
105k 
&gt;mi. Do the rebuilds from Bosch suck, or did I just get a bad one?
&gt;Thanks,

Relax Robb. If it's a genuine Bosch Reman, you are warrentied. Take it to
any Bosch dealer, preferably the one you bought it from, along with your
receipt. You did fill out and send in the warrenty papers?? And most
important of all, clean and tight terminals in good order everywhere and a
clean battery for certain. 

Also, check to see if the regulator says Made in Brazil. I haven't seen
that yet, but it won't suprize me if and when it happens. Everything I have
gotten recently has been the real deal with regulators and brushes made in
der Patterland.

I have installed over a hundred Bosch Reman in the last 9 years and have
one warrenty return on a distributor. It suggests the failure rate is
extremely low.
