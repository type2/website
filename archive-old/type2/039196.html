Subject: Re: Exhaust Wrap Good Idea?

Gentlepersons-
                       A couple of guys on the Morgan list tried the wrap on 
their cars and although it did work as advertised - cooler underbonnet temps 
- the pipes cracked at
the bends...Metal fatigue from too much heat being retained and softening the 
metal?
The cast iron headers fared better, but tubular headers cracked as well... 
Timewise,
from one year to three...??? your mileage may vary???
