X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

It only cost me $840 to go from their Terminal in Tucson Arizona to my
doorstep in VA. They actually delivered it to the closest terminal in
Manassas, VA, then shipped on rollback to my house. These prices were for an
estimated 14 day delivery, but it got there on the tenth day. I got a great
deal on the bus, so the extra $800 was worth it.

Prices below:
Terminal to Terminal = $720
Terminal to Door = $840
Door to Door = $920

I used www.DASAutoShippers_dot_com, they are affiliated with Ebay. That is how I
found my Bus. I think when I talked to the last, the rates had gone up about
$200.

Must have cost an arm and a leg! The last quote I got was for $1500.00 to
ship from Utah to North Carolina.
