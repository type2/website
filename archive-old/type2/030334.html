&gt; Is the distributor from a 2 liter vanagon engine compatible with the

First, from a mechanical &quot;fit&quot; standpoint... they are *all*
interchangable. The diameter and depth of the hole never changed, so any
dist will fit any block.  This is *not* to say that they will all *work*,
just that they will all fit :-)

Second, from a functional viewpoint...  A while back I asked on this list
if there was a &quot;universal&quot; vac advance dist.  The responses I got did not
give me enough confidence to post a definitive answer, but the two that
were most commonly mentioned were the pure vacuum 205T dist off the late
bug and the vacuum/mechanical family off the T4 engined buses (including
the early vanagons). I have never tried to run other than a stock dist, so
I don't have any experience to offer, but of the answers that I got, those
are the ones I'd pass along.
