Subject: Re: [T2] Adjusting FI mixture without an EGA

&gt; Ken - It sounds to me as if you have a rich condition
&gt; with the original AFM and maybe the &quot;new&quot; one is not
&gt; right for your engine. I don't remember - did you jump
&gt; through all the hoops before deciding on changing the
&gt; AFM, or was it just an easy tool that you figured
&gt; would help in diagnoses?

Yup, I went through all the other stuff first.  I've gone through 3
different Bosch manuals looking for hints.  The new AFM is from a 76
bus.  My bus is a 77 Westy manufactured in 76.  Both AFM's are of the
7 pin variety.  The part numbers are different but, I was of the
understanding that the L-Jetronic AFM was flexible in its use between
models - the new one works, its just a bit flat.  In fact, like I
stated, it actually makes the engine operate smoother.  However, when
I install the new AFM, I have to turn the idle air mixture 2+ turns
clockwise to bring the idle back to normal.  I picked up the new AFM
to have a spare for long trips.  I'd still like to have the absolutely
best performance and fuel economy that I can get and if that could
help to increase longevity, I would be happy with that too.

&gt;I'm thinking it's mucked up
&gt; your diagnoses... Don't get too involved with mixture
&gt; adjustment screw. It's pretty much an idle thing
&gt; although it does have some influence up higher. It's
&gt; simply an air bypass port, similar to the air bypass
&gt; port that adjusts your idle speed.

If the mixture adjustment screw is primarily there for idle, how can
you dial in the AFM?

&gt; I think you really
&gt; need to look at all the causes for rich conditions -
&gt; that is, after you have pulled every vacuum hose off
&gt; the engine and inspected it carefully and re attached!

I'm with you there.

&gt;  Check your fuel pressure with vacuum to the pressure
&gt; regulator and with no vacuum to the pressure
&gt; regulator.

That test seems good.

&gt; Unplug the coldstart injector. If neither of those
&gt; offers a clue

Its fine.

&gt;, check the resistance at temp sensor #2
&gt; and at temp sensor #1.

Temp sensor #2 is good.  Where is temp sensor #1?

&gt; Finally, leave your pressure
&gt; gauge hooked up to the high pressure port after
&gt; sutting the engine off and see how quickly the
&gt; pressure drops off. It should hold for a few minutes
&gt; although I cannot remember the specs and am too tired
&gt; to look it up for you just now - sorry.

I've check this recently, it holds pressure for a pretty long time.
Well over a few minutes.

&gt; You have air getting into
&gt; your exhaust system also, so is there a blockage of
&gt; the exhaust that contributed to blowing out a/some
&gt; gasket(s)?

Do you say this because of the backfiring?  I think that the leakage
may be at the connection of the header to the head.  I had quite a bit
of trouble getting them to seal.  I'll check them again once I have
the spare time.

Thanks for you comments,
