I agree with John.. hammer works for me every time (I'll get around to
replacing the solenoid one of these weekends).

Wade,
The next time it doe not start, crawl under and give the solenoid a few good
whacks ith a hammer (not where the wire connect though).  Then try to start
it, if it starts right up, then you've got a dirty, rusty solenoid that
needs replaced.  This happens on my 75 and the hammer trick works every
time.  You're right though, there is no rhyme nor reason or consistency to
the starts and no-starts.  I'll bet this is it!
