Subject: [T2] Permatex ?3H?

I'm replacing the oil pressure sending unit on my '78 Westfalia.  The book
&quot;How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine&quot; (by Tom Wilson) says to
use a dab of &quot;Permatex 3H&quot; on the threads. (page 149)

I can not find the &quot;3H&quot; version of Permatex anywhere, or for that matter,
anyone who has ever heard of it.  Why is this?

I'll be calling Permatex customer service tomorrow, but I just thought I'd
tack this on the mailing list tonight.
