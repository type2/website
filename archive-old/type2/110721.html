Subject: Re: [T2] Propane tank question, Will this work?????????

Hello Thanks for the reply. That is what I was
wondering. I assume that the 68-79 Westfalias and the
Vanagon Westfailas do not have tanks with these new
safty valves either. Hmmm... Is this a state by state
regulation or a national regulation? Thanks and have a
great day!

Regards,

David Kelly
