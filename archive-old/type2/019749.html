Subject: Where is Scott's Double Cab?

Just thought you might be interested in a vehicle position locator that
I am working on for my Double Cab.  It is a by product of being a ham
radio operator (KN6F).  By connecting a GPS unit to a radio modem and
the modem to an unused radio, I can track my vehicle anywhere in the
world.

I currently have the unit set up in the garage running off of a car
battery

Check out this web page

and see if you can find me

Scott
