Subject: horsehair above oilbath

	Fascinated by the description of how to clean the horsehair 
above oilbath in the aircleaner, I just removed my aircleaner but it 
appears to be a sealed tin can, the only opening a cm-annulus round 
the bottom which sits in the oil.
	I take it the aircleaner  37 028 58 261 is original '73.
	Any advice please on whether it is meant to be dismantled?  I 
can open tin cans, but they often suffer irreparable damage  ...
