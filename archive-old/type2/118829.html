Subject: Re: [T2] New Member with a FrankenBus Timing Question

OK thanks very much for the advice, I'll take another crack at it tomorrow.
Does the 27 degrees BTDC sound right?  My engine prefix is EAS then 6 digits
which sounds weird but it is definitely an S and not a 5...

Andre



&gt; On your timing it sounds like the distrubtor drive
&gt; shaft is in the wrong position. Timing marks are very
&gt; simular on the T-2,T-4, and the 914 (looking through
&gt; the hole you have a white line and a red line on the
&gt; air turbine)at least on the rough set the T-4 &amp;
&gt; Porsche are tweeked at 3500 RPM to set the advance on
&gt; the distrubtors(red line on the air turbine), but they
&gt; all line up and time the same way for the valve
&gt; adjustments. Find # one TDC and line everything up
&gt; with it..If you can rock the air turbine do not start
&gt; the engine untill you have this tighened..The timing
&gt; marks are on the air turbine looking through the hole
&gt; on the air housing..    Phil

Find TDC for #1 directly:
remove the plugs, remove the valve cover on the #1 side, and rotate the
engine until #1 piston comes up to TDC.  (If you can't peer down the spark
plug hole to see the piston moving up and down insert a thin piece of soft
wire through the spark plug hole and do it by feel.)  Check that the valves
are both closed.  Now go look at the position of the rotor; if it's pointing
at the plug wire that goes over to #1 you're set, irrespective of whether
it's pointing at the notch in the distributor body.

I'm guessing what you're feeling pulling on the pulley is endplay.
