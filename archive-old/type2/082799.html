&gt; for two years now I have been running the BFG All-Terrain size

&gt; 1510lbs_at_50psi.

This is a bit short of the 1540 spec, but not as bad as passenger tires

  I run the tire _at_45psi and have zero sidewall sag.  At a
&gt; total capacity of 6,400 lbs I can't imagine our busses coming close to that
&gt; vehicle wait since my 1969 chevy blazer with 1 ton truck axles, a wench,
&gt; extra batteries heavy duty bumpers, bla, bla, bla weighs 5,500 lbs.  I have
&gt; been very happy with this tire even with the buss loaded to the gill with
&gt; camping equipment.

Wouldn't this depend upon the weight of the wench?  (rimshot)
