&gt; i need to replace the boots on rear axle.
&gt; i have read dif. stories about dif. types of boots. (ie. brazilian boots = 
&gt; no good)  da bus is a '74 westy.

I like Rockford boots:

&gt; which ones are ok?

These are the best ones I've used.  2 years so far and they look like new.

&gt; where can i get them?

I get mine at a local brake/axle jobber.  Check the website for your local
dealer.  I think that they sell direct as well.

&gt; how hard to replace if you live in an apt. complex with no garage area to 
&gt; work, only the parking lot?

Not hard.  Remove 12 bolts and the axle comes off in your hand.  Then you
remove one of the CVs (this may require some tapping with a hammer and
brass drift on the _hub_ of the CV), remove and replace the two boots, and
reassemble in reverse order with new grease.

If your present boot is
completely shot and dirt got in, you have to remove both CVs and
disassemble to clean them completely.
Otherwise just remove as much grease as you can with paper towels and
repack the CV with new grease.

Cover any surface on which you will work with clean cardboard or somesuch
as this is the messiest job you will encounter on a bus.
