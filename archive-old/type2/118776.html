Subject: RE: [T2] Re: found something real neato

&gt; How about a 6 CD series of Jean Shepherd to go with your
&gt; VW AM radio + 8-track + cassette adapter + CD player +
&gt; single speaker...

With that many devices plugged into each other, assuming of course
that everything is in the stock radio mount on the dash, you would
probably have almost a 1 ft. length of archaic/retro/modern hardware
sticking out of your dash.

  You would have to put the bench seat back into your bay window bus
so that somebody could change your Jean Shepherd cds for you....
Now there is a mental image.
