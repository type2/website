Subject: Mini-Trip report / gas milage (longish)

Hey Volks!
        Well, I took Molly out to New Hampshire last weekend for a farewell
trip.  I'll be storing her through the winter as soon as enough snow hits
the ground for salt to be used, *sniffle*.  I hope when the time comes, that
I'll be able to do it -- I really, really, *really* don't want to, but I
know it's for the best, and her frame will last another summer if I do.
Anyhow, enough of my sobbing and on with the report.  

        Before leaving, I had put a shim (washer) on the sticky cut-off
solenoid on my right carb (PDSIT 34-3), since I was having troubles with a
slow idle.  I found that when I loosened that solenoid, the engine sped
right up and seemed to idle alot better, so I shimmed it out.  I left the
left solenoid alone, but it might have problems, since diconnecting the wire
to it doesn't drop the RPM at all.  (The right one *does* drop the RPM when
disconnected)  Anyhow, I met my friend Seth and his dog, Maggie in
Waterville, and we then headed to Auburn to pickup the last of our travel
party, Misti.  We saw a local band play at Bates College, and then spent the
night at Misti's place in Auburn.  The next morning was *chilly*, and after
breakfast and coffee we headed out, westbound.                  It was a
beautiful, sunny day, and an enjoyable drive though Mechanics Falls, Naples,
and then to Rt 302 near Bridgeton.  All along the way I was pointing out all
the Buses and Vanagons that I knew, shouting 'Westy!' every once in a while.
:) We pulled into North Conway, New Hampshire that afternoon and did some
window shopping even though we didn't have the money to buy anything, and
then checked out the local mountain shops for free stuff like stickers and
catalogs.  Since we were in town, I took everyone over to the cliffs
(Whitehorse and Cathedral Ledges), so that they could see where I do my rock
climbing during the summer.  The cliffs looked different with all the leaves
off the trees, allowing us to see the full scale of them.  We bouldered
around for awhile, then headed northwest out of town towards Bartlett, NH.
On the way, we saw a middle age couple broken down alongside the road and
stopped to offer assistance.  Unfortunately, they had a FI engine which I
had absolutely *no* clue about, so we gave them a ride back to the nearest
town and wished them luck.  We continued on into Crawford Notch and started
searching for good campsites.  After a bit of driving around, we came upon a
state campground that was closed for the season, but left open for use.  It
was completely empty except for a WildCountry mountain tent and no vehicles
to be seen.  We chose a site way back along the campground road, on a nice
raised platform, and set up camp.  There was a stream nearby with ice-hooded
rocks and crystalline ice sculptures everywhere -- very picturesque.  We
slept very comfortably and had plenty of room except for having to step over
the dog!
  In the morning, I adjusted the carbs again, since we were only getting
about 13.7 mpg (with 2 passengers, 1 dog, and gear), and we headed back the
way we had come, stopping to climb at Jockey's Cap Cliff in Fryeburg, ME.  I
dropped off Misti at her home, and Seth at his van, and continued on my way.
In Augusta, I checked my mileage again -- 13.8 mpg (no passengers) -- not
good.  So this time, I decided to remove the shim from the solenoid and
readjust the carbs *again*.  The remaining 72 miles home, I got between 17.9
and 18.5 mpg which was certainly a big improvement.  We had a great time,
and I was able to get the mileage up during the trip, so it was definitely a
success.  I look forward to many more places to go next summer with Molly!
Putt..putt..putt..putt..putt!
