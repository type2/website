Subject: 205x70x14 tires on a Splittie?

I have four very nice 205x70x14 tires, like new with lots of tread
(10/32), M+S, an off-brand (Arizona). I took them off the DOA '87 Syncro
when I parted it out. 

I need to replace the totally rotten tires on my '64 Standard. Are these
205s I have too wide for the stock rims?  I'm not thinking of these as
long term tires, just something to put on as part of a program to
resurrect the bus and get it back on the streets. 

No Cal look jokes, please, this bus is definitely not sano ;-).

Thanks

Tom F.
