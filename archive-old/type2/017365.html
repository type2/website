&gt; 
&gt; Duncan, my 72 has been really good, and I owned a string of 71's (and a few
&gt; earlier splitties) along the way . . . other than the aggravation of
&gt; workin' on it (no access thru upper deck - been thinking about getting
&gt; handy with a circular saw) what are the unique problems with the 72 ??

First year for the Type IV engine, no over-engine access hatch (good
