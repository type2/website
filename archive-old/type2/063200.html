Subject: Still more tranny woes

Volks,

This is almost starting to sound like a broken record.  Here's what
transpired today:

I took the old transmission into the shop in the morning for the &quot;free
diagnosis&quot;.  I guess I talked to someone different yesterday because now
they tell me they would road test the car for free, not look at it out of
the car.  So, I leave.

Next, I take an early lunch and take the &quot;new&quot; tranny with the stripped out
bolt holes back to the dismantler where I got it.  The guy has another
transmission there, waiting for me for exchange.  I was suprised that he
found one, but I didn't argue.  I asked what year it was out of, and he
wouldn't tell me, or didn't know, or something.  I look at this other
tranny - holes in question are filled with crud but he helps me clean them
out and I finally agree that they are acceptable (i.e. not stripped).

Next I start moving the shift rod and notice that it is real loose.  Has
about 1/2&quot; of in and out free play where the other two trannies (my old one
and the one I had originally bought) had less than 1/4&quot;.  I try to shift it
into various gears, and two of them don't seem to work - the input shaft is
locked up while in those gears.  Two gears on the other side work fine.

Finally, the numbers on the tranny were different.  The other two trannies
had numbers starting with 002, and this one had numbers starting with 091.
None of my manuals explain these numbers, and I was afraid this tranny was
from an older bus than mine.

At that point, I asked for my money back, and the guy grudgingly obliged.
I called Rancho Performance Transaxles (800-304-8726) who were very helpful
and told me that the 091 meant 76-79 case with heavy duty ribbing and
bigger bearings - supposedly highly sought after for dune buggies and stuff
because they are so strong.  002 is pre-76 tranny.  Rebuilt 091 from them
is $450 + $175 core.  Said they would give me $100 for the earlier tranny
as a core, which brings the price up to $525, plus shipping.  Argh.  No
time to ship unless I pay through the nose for air shipping.  Probably
another $100.  Forget it.

I made a few more calls to junkyards hoping to get lucky, and about the
third place I called said, &quot;yeah, we got a few of them hippie busses,
tranny is $100, you pull&quot;.  I asked him if he was sure they were not
Vanagons or splits, and he was sure.  Because I am running out of time, I
decided to take the afternoon off and go look at the busses.  I drive 15
miles home, change, drive 35 miles to the junkyard with my tools, walk
through this HUGE yard, and there are ZERO breadloaves.  A couple of
Vanagons, and a bunch of bugs, but no loaves.  I thank the proprietor for
wasting my time (I seem to be doing that a lot lately) and leave.

I remembered there was a VW repair place nearby that had been closed on the
weekend, so I drive over.  Guy there is real nice, but doesn't do any type
IV stuff.  He makes a couple of calls for me and finds a guy down the
street that has a &quot;rebuilt '76 bus transmission minus bellhousing&quot; for
$300.  I drive down.  The transmission has been sitting on the floor for 11
years, as best I can tell.  It looks rebuilt, but has dust and crud, THICK
all over it.  He blows all the dirt off with compressed air, and I see
light rust on the exposed ring gear.  The tranny has 4/85 stamped into the
top, which is my guess as to when it was rebuilt.  He sprays WD-40 on the
ring gear and scrubs it with a brillo pad.  I complain about the rust, but
finally agree that it isn't serious (no pitting).
Unfortunately he won't budge on the price.  Knows what it is worth, etc.
I'm starting to feel better about the transmission - the shifter is firm,
seals are making squeaky-rubber-sealing noises, gears don't rattle,
bearings tight.  I bite the bullet and give him the $300.  He throws in a
new input shaft seal for free.

On the way home, I pick up a gallon of 80-90 gear oil in preparation for
the bellhousing swap.  Decide to try and get the tranny put back on the
engine tonight so I can put it all back in the bus Saturday morning.
Decide to count the teeth on the ring and pinion just for fun.  Pinion
should have 7, it does.  Ring should have 32... but it has 38!  I count
again to make sure, and it's still 38.  A quick divide yields a final drive
ratio of... 5.43...

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!&amp;(^(*&amp;^%$*%$^)&amp;#%_at_^%

God must be paying me back for all of the good luck I've had with parts
before I moved to Dallas.  I'm upset because the old tranny had a final
drive of 5.375.  All 76-79 transmissions (except for those rebuilt by
psychos) should have a 4.57 final drive.  So what was once a stump-puller
bus will be even more of a stump-puller if I install this transmission.
The only consolation is that 4th in this tranny is .88 vs. .89 in the old
tranny, so 4th gear comes out about the same.  Back home again I call
Rancho again and they tell me this ring and pinion set was only installed
in late model 1600 loafs over in Europe.  No US busses got this ring and
pinion.  My guess is that someone built it for a dune buggy or other
large-tired vehicle.  Or maybe they were just psycho.

I thought about taking this transmission back for a refund, and have
tenatively decided against it.  I am very tired of this whole ordeal and
getting really, really short on time.  I think I will just install this
tranny for the trip, because it's in the best shape of any I've looked at
and I won't have to deal with wasting more time and driving hundreds of
miles to find another one.  It's also clean and shiny (hee hee, I'm
starting to go crazy), and looks impressive next to my old greasy one.
When I get it installed maybe I'll rent a trailer and tow my Mustang around
for a while, just cause I can.  Maybe I'll put 31&quot; tires on the back of the
bus.

One lesson I've learned from all this is to know all about what you are
working on BEFORE you buy anything, and check anything you buy VERY
CAREFULLY to make sure it is just what you want.  I never had to worry
about this before, but then, I was in San Diego, the land of many many VWs
&quot;before&quot;.  Things are different out here - parts are scarce, and what's
available is mostly garbage.
Can't just walk into a junkyard any given day and find what you need plus a
brand new window seal and a bus clock.  I think next summer if I make the
Baja trip I'm gonna set aside an extra week to hit every major city in
California and fill my bus up with parts from the junkyards.  Okay, I'm
getting giddy from the cold medication I'm on - time to call it a night.
Thanks for listening...
