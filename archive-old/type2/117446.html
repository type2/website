&gt; Uh, the Honda has a &quot;sandwich&quot; motor/generator but I don't think the Prius does - I think it is a more conventional setup as it is a much larger motor (44hp).  I could not find any information on the web to confirm this though.
&gt; &gt;Oddly enough, the conventional VW TDI diesel gets nearly the same mileage
&gt; &gt;with a lot less complexity.
&gt; &gt;A full hybrid design puts motors in the wheel hubs, eliminating the
&gt; &gt;entire mechanical drive train and braking system.

not necissarily, two companies are building true hybrid buses, 

&gt; I'm still praying that someday the technological challenges of this method will be overcome and we will get vehicles like this.  A 60hp electric motor at each wheel would be very interesting!  But in the meantime, who will be the first to put a Prius drivetrain in a bus?  Sounds like a good project for a highschool physics class.  :)

New York City has just placed orders for 230+ Orion VII hybrid buses,
these buses have a small diesel engine driving an alterantor and charging
a bank of batteries, there is a single electric motor driving the rear
axles thru a fairly standard drive train, which will drive the motor as a
generator when braking.

NJ transit also has some MCI hybrids which are the big over the road
coaches (Greyhound type) that have a really large battery pack but
operates similar to the NYC buses.

(Mandatory bus content) I have played with a similar concept for an older
bus I had with a blown engine,  was going to put electric engine onto the
rear of the standard tranny,  small generator above it in the engine
compartment, electronics on the side where the batterys are now and a
battery tray in the center with a raised floor.   $$$$ kept me from
bringing this to fruition but it was mostly designed...would still love to
actually build it...
