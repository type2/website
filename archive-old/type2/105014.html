Subject: Re: [T2] FUSES

George,

I wanted to go into business at some ofths shows doing the gold plating 
thing....think about it.  You could have one of those machines that does
it on the fuse holder itself.

New ones that are gold plated sitting there ready to go....

A plating unit like the &quot;detailers/dealerships&quot; use to make &quot;gold&quot;
emblems and trim on your car.

We would all be finished with bad contacts on the fuse box after that!

Any enterprising souls out there that want to go into business for 
themselves?

What would you pay for a fuse box where all of it(except the plastic of 
course) was gold plated????

Cheers, dave

&gt; The fuses may be made of different materials, or they may just have
&gt; different plating on them.  I would love to find some that are gold plated
&gt; so that they wouldn't corrode.  Perhaps at the Mercedes dealer... :)
&gt; 
&gt; There are at least two different varieties of ceramic bodies.  The smooth
&gt; body with the indents for the fuse elements are late, while the round
&gt; bodies with circular ridges are the old style.  I'm sure the vintage guys
&gt; are hoarding those!
