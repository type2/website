Subject: Oil pressure sensor

Ok, it's getting really really close now.  I only have two wires left to
connect in my engine before I'm done.  But...
I didn't notice until just now that the rebuilt AVP T4 that I got had a
different oil pressure sensor than the engine I took out.  The old one had a
remote pressure sensor with two screw type connectors, that the two
remaining wires I have attached to.  The new engine has the pressure sensor
screwed directly into the case and has a single spade-type male end.  What
do I do?  Should I remove the new pressure sensor and re-install the old
one?  Will the old one fit into the same hole? (it looks like it might be
too small)  Is there something I can do to attach my two wires in a
meaningful way to the single connection new pressure sensor?

TIA,
Niall
