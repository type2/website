Jim.

Are you absolutely sure that the Vanagon heat exchangers you bought for your 
1979 VW Type 2 engine, were actually stainless steel rather than aluminised 
or Zinc galvanised mild-steel?

If they were indeed stainless steel, I would be interested to learn who the 
manufacturer was and which pattern of heat exchangers they are - a VW part 
number would be useful. In Great Britain, our 1972-83 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2s, 
were all equipped with twin solex carburettors, two heat exchangers and an 
exhaust silencer (i.e. muffler), but no EGR or catalytic converter.
