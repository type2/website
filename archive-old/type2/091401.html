Hello Type2 List Adminstrator!

I have lurked your list for a number of years, and have used the
searchable archives many, many times to help locate answers to questions.

I come to you now with a request.  I have seen you post messages to your
list on behalf of volks who are not members, and I hope that you will do
the same for me.  Please see below:


*****************************************************
Howdy Volks!

A friend of mine recently acquired a really cool but rusty 1968 Bay
Window Double Door Panel Bus.  This is a Panel Van with a sliding door
on BOTH sides of the vehicle.  The left hand (LH) lower rocker panel is
eaten away pretty bad with rust, to the extent that the track that
supports the bottom sliding door roller is gone.  He needs a repair
panel to fix it, and is having a hard time coming up with it.

He has ordered and acquired the follwoing part:

211 801 672 D  Runner for Sliding Door, Right Lower

NONE of my parts catalogs show the equivalent part for the LH side of
the vehicle.  I'm guessing that the number is something very close to
that for the RH side part; something like this:

211 801 673 D, or
211 801 671 D.

I tried to verify both of these possibilities by searching the online
parts database at busdepot_dot_com, but I got nothing for either of these
numbers.

Now, I know that Busses in the UK, where Volks drive on the wrong side
of the road [;-)] , have sliding doors on the LH side of the vehicle.  I
bet that you Brits have access to these repair panels.

Can anyone supply me with the part number I need?  How about a supplier?

Since I am not a member of the Type2 list, please send your responses to
the email address below, or give me a call.

Many Thanks!!
