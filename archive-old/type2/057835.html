Hello anyone,

Please help me get my BN4 Heater to make heat.
I need the relay switch that activates the fuel pump and has the safety switch on it.  Does anybody have a late model BN4 heater I could buy for parts that has the relay on it? Also does any body know where I might be able to find a manual on this heater?  I just bought this heater and it took me a little while to figure out how the various switching devices work. But I haven't figured them all out I am not sure how the switch works that shuts the unit off if there is too much gas or no spark.  When I got my unit the wires were unhooked or cut out.  I drew up a wiring diagram, minus the heat control (which I don't have either) so If any wants to investigate it I would be happy to  fax this to them. I am not sure If you need the heat control, I think you could just go with out it and run it at full boar all the time. Please help!!! E-mail me and we could talk heaters.
