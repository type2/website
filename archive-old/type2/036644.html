Subject: Blowouts!

A handfull of quick blowouts that might be of interest:

1)  Left side outer front-door window scrapers w/chrome molding - GENUINE
VW.  VW has been making these in Brazil for years, but due to VW's
distribution agreements between their divisions in various countries we
couldn't get them here in the U.S..  These made it here sideways and nobody
else has them.  The fit is better than the aftermarket Brazilian ones
currently sold by WCM, RMMW, and everyone else, and they're cheaper.  Price
is $21.95 (plus shipping), which is $15 off my price for aftermarket ones
(which is already lower than anyone else's).  Some have one or two _very
small_ dings in the chrome, but nothing that isn't likely to happen after a
couple of months on the bus anyway (or can't be straightened with a flathead
screwdriver in a few minutes).  Part # 211 853 321B  By the way I will have
more &quot;banned&quot; Brazilian genuine VW body rubber coming within the next couple
of months (including corresponding right sides, probably for about $10
more).  These parts will have traveled around the world and back in order to
find their way to you, but it will be worth it considering that thru
&quot;official&quot; channels you would never see them in the US.  (Anybody hear of
the term &quot;gray market?&quot;)

2)  Rear brake shoes, original German Pagid, $24.95/pair, for '73-79 bus.
Again, not available anywhere else. These are not the &quot;white-box&quot; resurfaced
ones usually sold in the U.S. I will have them again but at a higher price.
Stock up.  Part #  211 609 537N

3) Still have some Boge (Mexico) front (211 413 031P) AND rear (211 513
031R) shock absorbers left for $16.95 each. These are about 1/2 off the
original price.  These are original-equipment for your bus, built to the
same specs to the ones that VW used when your bus was new. You will not find
a shock of this quality again for this low a price.

4)  Right-side '68-71 (only) heat exchangers, original German Volkswagen
N.O.S., $79.95.  Once these are gone that's it; I bought all they had.  See
the archives for listmember comments on how much better these are than the
Danish ones made now.  Part # 043 255 108H

Most of these prices reflect Listmember discounts NOT listed on the website.
If you order via the website, you MUST specify that you are a listmember in
the &quot;comments&quot; section of the order form in order to get these prices. We
will manually reduce your price accordingly upon shipment.  (Otherwise you
can email or call.)  Prices good for one week or until supplies run out,
whichever comes first.  Allow about a week for shipping depending on how
many orders I get.  (The scrapers in particular require a lot of time to
pack since UPS likes to bend them in half whenever possible. :-)
