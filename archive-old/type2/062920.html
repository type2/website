Subject: Re: Deluxe Micro Middle Seat

Sorry to jump into this late (been enjoying the hospitality of the Kansas 
City Kombis NEATO chapter this weekend), but my early '64 Deluxe has the 
full width middle seat and the right third does fold forward.  I also had 
a '69 that was the same way (both were the original stock seats).  All 
the '65 - '67s that I have seen were either 2/3 seats or missing 
entirely.  Some help this was ...
