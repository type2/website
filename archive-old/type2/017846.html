Subject: HELP wrong torsion bars??  HELP
Message-ID: &lt;372CA075.7A1F_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

Hey all,
I have been re- doing the rear end (bearings, brakes, shocks) &amp;
suspension including re-setting the torsion bars

I have a 76 Westy Deluxe -
I'm the 3rd owner - 2nd owner had her for &lt;2yrs
There were no markings on the wheel housing / spring plate / or where
the spring plate and torsion bar mesh.
This leads me to believe that the torsion bars have never been tampered
with (add to it the difficulty getting it all apart and the lack of any
scratches anywhere in the vicinity of the bars)

Big Problem - when I pulled the torsion bars out, they were RED!!!
They are supposed to be GREEN
And they measured the diameter at 26.9 mm instead of the 28.9 (Bentley
manual is in the garage so thease may be slightly off, but they are the
smaller of the 2 listed bar diameters

Has anyone else had this similar problem - did VW change something???
I know that the Bently procedure for the wheel bearings are not quite
right for my 76 (no outer circlip)  &amp; the brake set up in bently is not
the same as I have (no pins through the backing plate &amp; the shoes)

What gives??

This is an original westy thru and thru

Almost want to contact VW (hmmm 23 yr old bus...)

Any advice???

I have adjusted both sides 4 notches for an increase of 2degrees &amp;20min
I'm hoping to get ~1-2 inches raise at the bumper (calculations ignoring
the front suspension and putting the pivot point at the torsion bar gave
me ~2.4 inches increase at the rear bumper)

 
But the RED smaller diameter bars have me concerned

Help!
