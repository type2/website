the biggest problem with the progressive kits is inadequate manifold heat.
Most of the manifolds are GARBAGE WRT this necessary item, and the carb is
very difficult to tune because of it. Get a properly heated intake, and your
job is a lot easier!

The progressives are a bit of work to jet, but once you are there they are a
fantastic combination of power, drivability, and mileage.
