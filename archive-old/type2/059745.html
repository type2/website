Hi,

I'm still looking for a VW crew cab truck.  Any year is fine.  Must be fairly
rust free (no major repairs needed to body or bed) I'm located in Florida but
would be willing to look elsewhere.  
Does anyone have any leads on Canadian Transporter (Vanagon p-ups) that aren't
outrageously priced?

Thanks for your help!

Dave
