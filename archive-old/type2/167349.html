Subject: Re: Help needed: Headlight wiring on 1975 bus

&gt; I just need to know where the white wire goes to in the fuse box. The  
&gt; wiring diagram suggests the top of fuse #6, but that doesn't seem to  
&gt; work. I suppose It's also possible that we might have multiple issues  
&gt; here....
 

Another thing to note,, I *think* the bentley shows the fuse panels view'd 
from the &quot;front&quot;  FIF ... when your looking at the fuses ,, your looking at 
the back of the fuse panel.. and that changes the way you number the fuses. 

please check.. your panel cover should have the numbers on it.
the fuses for the headlights are .. most likely,, 2 over from the right 
side.. the next 4 are for the headlights. 

maybe someone can confirm this... my fuse panel is burried under the parcel 
trays.. too hard to take a picture for you..
