Automatics do not have the same stresses on the end bearings, (no clutch
pushing and releasing)

thus they do not wear in as much end play.

as for the end play, I would probably leave it, but you pays your money
you takes your choice.  other opinions on the end play invited, I just
haven't rebuilt enough engines
