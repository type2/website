Subject: Re: oil light wierdness follow-up

just talked to  my friend Louis about oil lights... the bad news is that he
views oillight flicker at idle to be a sign of a completely worn engine.
Bad oil pump, pounded bearings, etc. Good news is that he says hey if it
still seems to run well otherwise, start saving for another one and just
run the current case until it gasps its last. One *could* split the case,
align-bore, etc; for the same price, you more than likely can find another
engine used somewhere. Maybe its bottom end will have more life in it! I'm
going to see if any one on the list has any other options, probably replace
my oil pump, and try not to worry about it until its time (peace of mind
courtesy of my Sears &quot;400 miles of free towing&quot; policy!)
