Subject: Update: gas tank/fuel sender clues

Folks,

Did I mention this one still has a/c?  :-(

Got the engine and gas tank pulled today.  It took about 2 hours longer
than I figured, but I wasn't in a hurry.

Did I mention that this one still has an a/c compressor?  :-(

Wait till you see what was in the gas tank!
Also, there was one(just one) fairly good size(&lt;1/4&quot;) ball bearing
&quot;laying&quot;in the bell housing...what's up with that?  wait till you see
where it was &quot;laying&quot;!

The gas level sender is absolutely toast...

Pictures by tomorrow.

The only problem was the 2 sheetmetal screws that held the bottom of the
fuel tank bulkhead....nobody mentioned those...and they are
&quot;hidden&quot;..  The other was that you absolutely *must* have a *deep* 13 mm
to get the tank strap nuts off.

Transmission out tomorrow to replace the cv grease and boots, and replace
*all* of the shift rod bushings and seals.

Did I mention that this engine still had a/c?&lt;grin&gt;


Cheers, dave
