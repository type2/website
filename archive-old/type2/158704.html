&gt; The only thought I'd have is in regards to getting it to fit properly
&gt; after you've modified it.  You could just replace the plywood with
&gt; fresh wood, but it sounds like you have a larger scope in mind.
&gt;
&gt;
   Try calling around to the local lumber yards for &quot;marine grade&quot;
plywood...Sealed with a couple coats of epoxy-based sealer (West
Marine is one, but what you want is a penetrating sealant, not a
top coat) especially on ends and cuts...
