There are a *lot* of US-made standard RV parts on the Westies, too.  The
cabinet frames may be German, but the sinks, pumps, iceboxes, stoves, and
pretty nearly everything else (except the damned cabinet handles!!!) are
standard RV.  The RV phenomenon started in the US and many of the parts
were, and still are, exported.

I am of mixed emotions on the &quot;value&quot; of one versus the other, the are
worth what you can get for them, whatever the conversion.  I do like the
Riviera pop-top, certainly better than the 68-73 pop-top, tho tied with
the 74-&gt; design.  I am also a big fan of the (much rarer in the US) 
Dormobile design.  The one *big* plus to the late (74-&gt;) Westy design is
that it is the only bed that supports my 100+ kg body with no complaints,
but a Dormobile top over a late Westy bed would be fine :-)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
