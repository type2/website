&gt; Another ? - according to the VIN, my bus is a Kombi, but everything

&gt; &quot;cabinet&quot;.  It also has louvered windows.  Is this a Kombi or did
&gt; someone in the past try to make it a &quot;pseudo- camper&quot;
 
I have a 1971 which according to it's vin is a stationwagen with the 
same setup minus the cabinet. It appears to be original but I could be 
wrong, can anyone clarify matters?
