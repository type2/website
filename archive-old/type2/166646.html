Subject: Re: [T2] dent in pushrod tube opions requested

as long as it isnt leaking and isnt affecting the push rod then you will be ok till you get it changed but i would change it as soon as you can if the dent is really bad...
   mine have some dents but nothing major and nothing affecting anything... longs there is no rubbing or leaking...IMO

  Hi,



I have a dent in a push rod tube at the drivers side, closest tube to the
bumper.



I was doing a repair to the motor to get rid of a leak, perhaps would be the
reason for the leak?



It runs along the push rod tube, about &lt; inch and about 1/16 to 1/8 deep.



No damage to the push rod at all.



Alan
