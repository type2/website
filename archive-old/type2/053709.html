Subject: Rims powder coated + new tyres/tires

Hi all,
I got my two used rims powder coated in a cream colour.  Picked them up
today and had tyres put on them.  They will look great once I get some new
hub caps.
I got the Michelin Agilis 61 tyres (these are what Jan recommended about a
week ago but with a slightly lower load rating).  They look very chunky and
hard wearing - I think I will be replacing them due to old age long before
the tread wears out.
Cost was 55UKP for the blasting &amp; powder coating, and 55UKP each for the
tyres.  Not cheap but hopefully worth it.  Next month - the other two.
