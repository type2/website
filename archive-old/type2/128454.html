Subject: Re: [T2] turning engine over w/o alternater

Yes, it just won't charge. On the Beetle engine you could drive it without a fan belt 'til it overheated. 

I have run Beetle engines on the ground. The Type IV would too if it wasn't for the complicated fuel injection laying all over the place. 

FWIW I have driven many miles without a functioning alternator/generator. Turn everything off to save the battery and as long as the battery isn't powering anything but the ignition you can go many miles as long as you don't turn it off - the starter pulls alot of juice. The fuel injection busses don't go as far because the battery must power the fuel pump, injectors, ignition, computer, etc.
