&gt; &gt; Ok I need to buy a gauge to check the endplay of my crankshaft. I am

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is it called? I am going to a FLAPS and I could go to Sears. Anything
&gt; &gt; special I need to know?

They are called &quot;dial indicators.&quot;  You will also want a &quot;magnetic base&quot; to 
hold it.
Sets of reasonable quality can be found at www_dot_use-enco_dot_com for around $25.

I doubt Sears has them in the store, and I really doubt you'll find one at 
a FLAPS.
Look in the yellow pages for stores catering to machine shops, if you must 
find one
locally.
