&gt;don't have a manual but if you decide to get rid of the auto tranny give
&gt;me a hollar

There you go, just what you need to stay on track with an easier swap, 
someone with an auto chassis that needs an auto tranny. Convert that auto 
into cash and buy a manual tranny. An auto and manual in similar condition 
have similar value.
