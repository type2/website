&gt; &gt; While the curtains are off the door I am considering putting an interior
&gt; &gt; hatch release and fitting a handle to pull it shut with. If anyone has done
&gt; &gt; this before please let me know what has worked for you.
&gt;
&gt; 78 and it was crude, cut about a 1x1 inch hole in the panel just to the
&gt; right of the latch and just about an inch or so above the metal,  ran a
&gt; heavy duty wire tie around an already provided release lever,  like I
&gt; said crude but it works

I pulled the panel in my '73, then made up a guide from coat hanger wire
that stuck out 1/4 &quot;  put the panel back and gave it a bop with my hand.
This made enough of a mark on the back of the panel to be a guide. I
drilled and made a longer pull with a loop on the end and it looks
factory!
