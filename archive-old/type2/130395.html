&gt; not gonna move much more, right? :)

Hello Guys   wasn't that what they said about the leaning tower of Pizza  ??  
  Do not set the end play too tight, drill a hole in the bottom of the 
bellhousing so that when it does start to leak oil it will have a place to drain and 
get a can of brake cleen to spray in the hole to clean the clutch disc when 
it gets oil on it, It should make it if he keeps oil in it , also be easy on 
the take offs as that will be when the crank will move the most  . He could try 
to peen the main in place with a center punch   later and have fun  Mark
