Subject: Re: [T2] engine oil additive problems coming? ?

The Australian company Penrite manufactures oils for older as well as
modern vehicles. Their take on zinc and phosphorous in oil is described
in the following article:

http://www.penrite_dot_com.au/files/9R5QGO28DX/85_ZINC_%20DIESEL_OILS_AND_AP
I.pdf

Interestingly though if you check the product information for the
recommended oil for bay windows (HPR 30) it has over 10% zinc in Oz but
not in the UK or USA!
