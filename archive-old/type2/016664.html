&gt; Question #1: Is this possible? Does anyone else know of this type of
&gt; setup?
A lot of different positions are possible; my advice would be (if the
thing was running when you started to work on it)to replace the wires on
the new cap in the same position as they were previously, and it should
run again. One caveat, however,is that some VW distribs retard #3
cylinder in relation to the others, so when #1 cylinder is firing, the
rotor should be pointing to the mark on the top edge of the distributor.
To get this to happen you should get a Bentley manual and check the
position of the dist. drive. If you need to change the position of the
dist. drive it's really nice to have a removal tool. I don't have one
and have successfully used several rigged up methods to remove it, the
nicest being a snap-ring pliers that expands while squeezing. 
&gt; Question #2:  I replaced the rotor and cap, with Bosch (I believe the
&gt; distrib to be Bosch), I noticed that there is a bit of &quot;play&quot; in the
&gt; metal part that the rotor slides down on to.  The play is that when I
&gt; slide the rotor down, and if I twist it gives a bit, so that my points
&gt; open or close slightly.  Is this normal? 
YES!! That is your centrifugal advance. During normal operation small
bob-weights drive the upper part of the shaft several degrees ahead
through the use of a cam against the spring tension you are feeling,i.e.
if you can turn it a few degrees (10-16 or so) against spring pressure
then your centrifugal advance is probably okay.
