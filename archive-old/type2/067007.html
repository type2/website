Subject: VW's in Documentaries

Excuse this post if it has been mentioned in the past.  I haven't seem it
mentioned but it is hard for me to believe it hasn't been.
I watched the documentary &quot;TieDied&quot; last weekend.  It is about Greadful Dead
fans.  It is loaded with VW buses.  Many many pictures and talk about them.
It is also a pretty good documentary even without the busses, but the busses
made it worth watching again.
You can probably rent it at your local vidio store, that is where mine came
from I believe.
