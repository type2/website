Subject: Re: [T2] scary situation

A german car mechanic said the same thing.  He took one look at it  and said he thought I had the wrong sender.  I guess I'll take  back the $7.50 1-1/16 deep socket as well.  I've got to find one  of those pressure guages too.   Thanks...KR

Well that's interesting.  I just went out to the garage and the size of 
my deep socket is 24mm.  I went and tried it on my parts engine sender 
and it didn't fit.  Then I went to my other engine and it fit perfectly. 
  Looks like there are two different sized senders.  The one on my other 
engine is also 24mm.

I'm thinking you want the sender that fits the 24mm because that socket 
will have no problems fitting through the sheet metal (it just clears it 
perfectly).

If you have to take the distributor out, just unscrew the bolt that 
holds the adjustment plate so you don't have to readjust your timing.
