the best bet is to get one German and
one Danish heat exchanger, as you did, which will still produce more heat
than a pair of Danish ones.
I changed Changed both my exchangers a few years back on my 72 bus. My bus is 
a daily driver (with no garage).  Snow, salt air etc... you know. 
The Danish right sides did not last.  I had one purchased NOS German and one 
Danish.  The Danish side was shot.  I thought they were both shot so I bought 
2 new one as listed above.  The German side was just rusty. 
Oh course, since I had no garage, I had prepared the curb side change with 2 
new exchangers (I kept the German side when removed).
One note, during my previous install I had painted the exchangers with some 
high temp paint.  It didn't last too long (peeled off).  I used some Wurth High 
Temerature paint (silver colored).  Anyways, I was not satisfied.  I called 
the wurth distributor prior to painting my new ones.  He suggested I sand blast 
the new exchangers prior to painting (get the primer off).  I did.  And then 
baking them. I did.  Both are a new as ever. Satisfied with both.
FYI, I used an old stove that was going to be thrown out. Took it to the 
basement (used the dryer plug). Stunk up the whole basement.
