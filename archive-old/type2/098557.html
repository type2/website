Subject: ADMIN:Re: [T2] Ebay: the polls are in!

&gt; I agree with Maui Haui, I think that if we say no adverting, we need to have
&gt; it no advertising.

The idea that the list has a &quot;no advertising&quot; rule seems to have taken
root.  Let me clarify this:

THERE IS _NO_ &quot;NO ADVERTISING&quot; RULE!!

Sorry for shouting, but I'm a teacher and I yell because I care.

If you read the charter (that means you actually read all the words and
understand what they mean) you will see that the _only_ prohibition on
advertising is the advertising of _auctions_.

Vendors can advertise items for sale directly to the list as long as they
are bus-related and kept to a reasonable level.

Anyone can advertise items for sale directly to the list as long as they
are bus-related and kept to a reasonable level.

I hope this clarifies the issue.

George Lyle, List Admin  &lt;---who has had 140 students through his lab
today and really doesn't need any more &quot;creative mininterpretation&quot; of
rules.
