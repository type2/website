Subject: idle cutoff valve/ replacement

first of all, i have to give a big thanks to Brad for
coming out to take a look at my bus.  It's amazing
what another set of eyes will do.  So for anybody out
there that doesn't know what question to ask... a
friendly VW neighbor might be able to help.

What he did notice that i did not, was that I am
missing the idleing cutoff valve.  I am actually
missing them on both sides, bowever on the left carb
there is a plug.  The right carb, is a hole.  I took
the plug from the left carb off and noticed that it is
too small for the hole in the right carb.  Reading the
muir book, I noticed that he says it is okay to
replace the elecromagnetic cutoff valves with the plug
as long as you are aware that your engine may keep
running.  However the plug isn't something that I have
seen at my FLAPS or hardware store, In the book he
said that VW sold them, but I don't know where. If
anybody could give me some insight into this it would
be appriciated.  For now, i'm not driving it, as there
is a fine mist of gas constantly coming from the hole.


Thanks
