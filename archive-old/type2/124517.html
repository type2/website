Anybody on this list from around the northern ND/Minnesota area?  I'm from
Grand Forks, North Dakota and it is a VW wasteland up here.  And get this,
there's a guy in town that owns a place that specializes in old VW's and he's
got a ton of bugs and ghias that he's working on.  I went in to see if he had
a part that I need and he had the guts yesterday to question why in the world
I would own a bus.  I no longer am associating myself with such a place.
Anyhow, I'm looking for some support out here where it is actually snowing
today.  The bus is staying warm in my garage.
