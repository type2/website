&gt; I have a book called &quot;Automuseum Wolfsburg&quot; that is a guide to the VW factory 
&gt; museum.  In it there is a late bay bus 4WD prototype.  It says that it was a 
&gt; forerunner of the Synchros.  Neat to look at. 
&gt; Now, is there anyway that anyone can think of that a VW transaxle, either bug 
&gt; or bus, can be tapped to provide an output for a driveshaft to go to the 
&gt; front of the vehicle to provide an auxiliary drive for the front wheels?  It 
&gt; was done for the Schwimmwagen, but I've never seen one of those close up to 
&gt; see how it was done.

Subaru is the modern manufacturer of this sort of layout.

&gt; I want to build an amphibious vehicle (not out of my Westy or Doublecab!) and 
&gt; with my sincere VW leanings I would love to use VW parts for it. The only 
&gt; drawback that I can see to using VW parts is the lack of front wheel (4 
&gt; wheel) drive to pull it out of the pond, lake, or whatever after a swim.
&gt; VW did it, so I assume that it is at least possible to get an auxiliary 
&gt; output from the transaxle.  I don't think that it will be easy.
&gt; If anyone could shed some light on this, or has tried it, or would like to 
&gt; discuss it, or whatever, please drop me an email.  (Can a Subaru ring and 
&gt; pinion be flipped so that a VW  motor could adapted to it and be rear mounted 
&gt; with the Subaru 4WD system used??)

I've asked this question before (with dreams of installing an entire SVX
drivetrain, including 5-speed transmission, in a bus or Vanagon).
Unfortunately, the answer was no.  There isn't enough space for the ring
gear on the other side of the case.  Too bad, really, since the vehicle
weight would have made a good match in the gearing.

&gt; If anyone has a Schwimmer (or Amphicar) anywhere near Wheeling, WV and would 
&gt; be willing to let me take a peek at it, please email me as well.
&gt; Lastly, and bus content, there was a white doublecab 'boat' pictured on the 
&gt; last page of VW Trends magazine sometime in the last year or so that had been 
&gt; converted to a boat.  Does anyone know anything more about that?
&gt; Sorry for the long ramblings, but there is a very diverse and helpful group 
&gt; on this list, and it's quite a resource to be able to pick your brains.

There is a amphib currently in production in England called the Dutton
Commander.  It might provide some ideas a bit more modern than the
schwimmer.
