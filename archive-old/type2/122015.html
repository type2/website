Subject: Re: [T2] Seat swap on a 72 bay

&gt; WW gets the padding from the original vendor in Europe and they order

Since I'm here in LA for the holidays, I drove out to WW on the 24th 
and picked up a set of the seat stuffing for my '76.  The quality is 
what I would call outstanding.  The fiber is held together with what 
appears to be silicone.  I'm not sure what was used 30 years ago, but I 
expect to get a lot of mileage out of these.  I'm going to put down a 
piece of canvas between the springs and the pads as an extra protective 
layer.

If anyone wants to see photos of these pads showing details, just let 
me know; I'd be happy to snap a few and put them up on my web server.

At $18/pad (2 bottoms and 2 backs required to re-stuff both front 
seats), I'd say it's quite a deal.  I'm looking forward to having comfy 
seats again, and getting rid of the ugly seat covers that currently 
blight my interior.
