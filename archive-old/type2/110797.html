Subject: junk yard report

well folks, i made my weekly junk yard run this
morning but didn't have a whole lot of time as i
needed to get home to take care of the baby.  my loss
is your luck.  they have an a/c unit complete except
the compressor in a bus.  i took half of it out before
i looked under the bus and found it would take way too
long to get the rest of the way out.  it is one of the
ones that mount above the seats and is in very nice
condition.  they also have several bumpers both 68-72
and 73-79 that are worth looking at.  they have a
safare hi roof in there and it still has the sink in
it and a late pop top but i didn't see the luggage
rack for it not that it wasn't there but i didn't slow
down enough to look for it.  i saw a few heater fans
for those who are missing them.  anyway, they are at
ecology auto recycler in willmington, ca.
