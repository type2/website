Subject: Re: [T2] 80 vanagon adventures


Steve:
I have the entire 82 at my disposal, so changing more parts is not that much of a
problem.
Regarding the metal cooling air intakes- I, too, now believe that feature extended
at least part way into 1981. The car I got the fried GEX engine from was an 81,
several other features including the serial number, but had the metal air intakes
as well.
Thanks,

&gt;
&gt; OK, as I heard it....  the air intakes at the upper rear corners of the
&gt; bus were a metal grill in 1980 only.  In 1981 and later years, that was a
&gt; rectangular cutout with a plastic insert.  I am certain given VW's &quot;mid
&gt; year change&quot; policy that there is at least one 1981 out there with metal
&gt; vents.
