Subject: Wiring Harness for '70

I'm restoring a 70 standard and have run into some problems regarding
wiring.  That is - the guy who owned it before me thought of himself as some
sort of electricity guru and replaced all of the original wiring with his
own black and red wire (at least he did use 2 colors).  So I've decided to
just rewire the whole thing.  The fusebox is still intact and in good shape,
I have the requisite switches etc. but I can't seem to find the actual
wiring loom from anyone.  Pre-68 sure - a complete harness is available, but
not for a 70.  I can find a main loom easily but I would rather spend the
extra money and rewire all of it.

any help would be appreciated...


Robert
