&gt;A question for you all: The alternator light on the dash of my 76' bus is
&gt;flickering for the first 5 minutes or so after I start driving. new belt
&gt;with good tension, new regulator (bought at FLAPS, so possibly not the
&gt;right one?) which seems to have been working fine, so I am just wondering
&gt;if there is a way to test the alternator?

There is a good procedure in the library at type2_dot_com.  Check the archives
for a part number for the correct aftermarket regulator.
