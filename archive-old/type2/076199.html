Subject: Bus parts for sale

Hey list-

In an effort to humor the spousal unit, I am in the process of 
thinning the herd a bit.  I have a couple of busses that I am going 
to finish parting out, and then they are off to the professionals. 
Anyway, I have a 73 passenger bus, and a 75 sunroof bus (hit hard in 
the front).  Let me know if there are any parts that you need, and I 
will see if I have them.  The engines are out of both of them, but 
both are in good shape.  The 1.7 has a single webber set up.  The 75 
bus had a just rebuilt 2.0 FI engine.  I will sell one of them, and 
use the other for my 73 panel bus.
