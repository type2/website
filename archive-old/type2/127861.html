Subject: Hi-temp paint for heat exchanger.

Hello list, I recently purchased a new heat exchanger from bus depot. I would like to paint it to inhibit rust from forming. I found this: http://www.jcwhitney_dot_com/autoparts/ProductDisplay/s-10101/storeId-10101/p-35/c-10101/catalogId-10101
 
At the bottom of the description it says, &quot;Not recommended for European vehicles.&quot; Why is that? Has anyone used this stuff? Does anyone have a better solution? Also, I was wondering if using exhaust wrap on the curved metal tubes directly below the heads would improve the performance of the engine. It seems I read somewhere that if the exhaust system is insulated, the gases are released quicker, making the engine run better. Does this apply to my 1973 bus? How would I go about doing that if exhaust wrap isn't the answer? Thanks in advance.                      -Paul Deatherage
