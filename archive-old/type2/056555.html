Subject: Re: List Server Info Needed

&gt; Would anyone happen to know the command needed to acquire the list of
&gt; subscribers from the request server.

&gt;&gt;If all is working as I hope it is, there is no way to get the list of
&gt;&gt;addressee's from the list server.  Neither is it available by asking.

Furthermore with the cooperation of findmail_dot_com, the web interface does
not display email addresses of posters unless you *really* dig for each one
and thanks to Stephen Gutknecht, it is not possible to search the archive
in such a way as to produce a list of addresses.

It's still possible to cut &amp; paste addresses out of list email messages,
though. Newbies, please note that it is NOT APPROPRIATE to harvest
addresses and send bulk unsolicited email, no matter what the content of
the bulk mail is. If you do it everybody will hate you, you won't sell any
wares, and several of us will make it our personal mission to make your
life sheer hell.
