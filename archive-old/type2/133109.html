Subject: Re: [T2] How Hot is too Hot for Oil Temperature

Doug,

If this is your 71 westy, it is waaaay too hot for a T1 engine.

about 220 might be a maximum....t4's can generally run a little hotter, 
but not really recomended.

Did you calibrate your sensor before you installed it??...as in boiling 
water so that you know *exactlly* where 212 is (give or take a few 
degrees)?

Synth oil is reputed to break down less at those temps than dino oil.
Lots of articles pro and con out there....some of the mags have done 
&quot;tests&quot;.


Cheers, dave

&gt; I was out driving my 1971 Westy after installing a new VDO gauge and managed
&gt; to achieve what felt to me like some pretty high temperatures.  Turning
&gt; about 4,000 rmp it got up to about 255 at one point.  Is this where bad
&gt; things start to happen?  When does oil break down?  What temperature is too
&gt; high for cylinder heads?  I read through the library and found oil
&gt; temperatures of 250 and cylinder head temperatures of 350f.  Is this
&gt; sustainable?

&gt; Thank you,
