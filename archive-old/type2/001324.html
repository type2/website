Hi all,

      I have a 82 aircooled Federal emissions westy.  I have a small nagging
problem.  I have no power coming to the full throttle switch.  I have pulled
the harness off of the ECU &amp; checked continuity from the plug to the switch.
Everything is fine there.  I looked in the Bentley but it does not really
show inside the ECU.  I am wondering does this mean that portion of the ECU
is bad?  I understand the ECU gets it's power from the double relay.  That
all checks out fine.  Any ideas?  What does this mean for my day to day
running of this bus?  Thanks.
