Subject: Dizzy Spring has Sprung!

Yikes! I need help!

While trying to get the timing right on my '74 1.8l with 050 Dizzy, my father
and I took the dizzy out to check it out thoroughly. After stabing the dizzy
in half-a-dozen times to get the orientation right, we finally got it close
enough to get the bus running. After eating lunch, Dad pulled the dizzy one
last time to reorient it one tooth over so the vacuum advance wasn't turned
all the way around. And here's the kicker:

When he attempted to seat the spring in the dizzy shaft, it somehow sprung
into the hole in the side of the dizzy port (don't know the exact words).
Where the hell did the spring go? Do we need to drop the engine and tear it
down? Or did it go someplace where it'll just rest in a nice oil bath until
the next rebuild?

We really didn't want to spend Christmas tearing apart the bus engine...

Pmail, email, or if possible, call (352)341-0210!

-Eric
