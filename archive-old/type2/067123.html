Before you kick yourself, despite the description, this is a MAJOR 
restoration project (NO FRONT NOSE SKIN!).

&gt;Found this on the bboards- Go get 'er!
&gt;
&gt;Excerpts from netnews.rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled: 28-Oct-96 1959
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Free to Good Home, 1959 Double Cargo Door Bus. Have most of the parts 
&gt;&gt; including the original engine. The bus is in need of restoration but is very 
&gt;&gt; solid. All glass is in good shape, and body rust is minimal. I hate to part 
&gt;&gt; with this but I have just purchased a new Impala SS and need my garage. The 
&gt;&gt; bus is located in Augusta, GA.
