Subject: Re: [T2] Turbo Bus

Welcome back Dave! I'm sure a lot of folks will be interested to see how
that comes out.
I'll look forward to seeing you at EveryBus in a year or two!
:)

&gt; I've been away from the list for a while, and my bus has been parked for
&gt; months.  My two little girls (1 and 3) have required pretty much all of
&gt; my free time for a while but in my head, while doing the chores, etc.
&gt; I've been plotting a grand reawakening for my poor, neglected bus.  Last
&gt; Thursday the biggest piece of the puzzle fell into place - I towed home
&gt; an 84 Passat turbodiesel.  The car is a basket case but the motor is
&gt; good and will bolt right up with the Vanagon diesel parts I've been
&gt; collecting.  It will take me a while to complete this project.  Months
&gt; probably, maybe even a year but it WILL be done.  If anyone needs parts
&gt; from an '84 Passat, please let me know.  I will also have a complete
&gt; well-worn 2-liter engine for sale plus a rebuildable 2-liter short block.
