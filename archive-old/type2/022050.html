Russell,

Your replacement is probably a sort of generic aftermarket unit that the 
manufacturer sells as a replacement for as many engine applications as 
possible to maximize sales and profit.  If you compared the stats on the 
contact closing threshold of the replacement unit and the correct, stock 
sender unit, the numbers are probably not the same.   

I personally wouldn't set the idle incorrectly just to cover up the behavior 
of an incorrect sender unit.  Two &quot;wrongs&quot; do NOT make a &quot;right&quot;!
