Hello all,
  I am needing to clean out my garage and have a few things for sale. 
34ICT Webers good used fit type 4. Come with manifolds and all hex bar linkage.
These were on a 73 Bus and would work great to replace the stock PDSITs or
progressive Weber. $200 OBO

Type 4/Vanagon 2.0L crank and rods. Good used set, can still see the polish on
the journals. Core value alone is $300, will sell for $125.

68-72 and 73 Cots(upper) from Westy. one has good canvas, other does not. $30
for all.

Now for the WANTED, I need a Diesel Rabbit(or other Diesel VW) in the Western
Washington area.(Tacoma-ish) Condition not important, must be cheap, running is
good but not required. Will trade for the above. 
My 85 Westy gets 16MPG and I can not afford to use it to commute, over $20
every 2 days, OUCH!
If you have one or know of one, please call or write me.
PS I also have a nice 72 Super for sale
