Subject: Re: [T2] Differences from vw pancake to Porsche 914 pancake

Hi Casey,

If you're looking to get more power for your Bus, consider checking out 
Raby's Aircooled Technology at www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com.  Jake Raby 
specializes in hi-performance T4 engines, and I'm running one of his engines 
in my Bus -- it's a stock displacement but a higher CR, and it makes great 
power for hill climbing and Interstate driving.  He does good work and is 
very knowledgeable and willing to work with the customer to asses and meet 
their needs.  He can probably build you an engine that will develop as much 
power as a 914 engine and still be designed to fit in your Bus.  I've found 
that 914 engines can cost more because they're from the Porsche side of 
things, and they're more rare since the market for them isn't as big as the 
Bus market is.

As always, YMMV.  Good luck!
