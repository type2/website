Subject: Update '71 Westy Weekender  [long]
Message-ID: &lt;39FDBDA6_at_operamail_dot_com&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0

Greetings listfolk,

Friday. &lt;G&gt;

I feel I owe this great resource a progress report on my '71 gutted Westy 
Weekender formerly known as Colonel Rustard. Oh, it's no less rusty than 
before but I'm now calling the bus &quot;Buttercup.&quot; It better reflects my growing 
kinship. Forgive me if I waffle a bit on the name and sex please.

Please also understand that I am not trying to restore this bus to factory 
original, but rather plug the leaks to keep it afloat.

I now have about 700 miles on a Fisher Buggies (Tampa) rebuilt 1600 DP Type II 
power plant. While it was being installed, I had them add new heads, the 
alternator conversion, and a solid-state ignition. We also got new engine 
rubber, engine compartment seals, and a new clutch and throw-out bearing. I 
later added two new brake light switches which seem to have solved the 
stuck-on brake light problem. I did none of the work myself except the brake 
light switches and the engine ordeal was an expensive proposition to the tune 
of ~$2300 for everything.

Well, almost everything. To keep the year-long P&amp;L warranty in effect, I had 
to return to Fisher at 500 miles to have the heads torqued and valves 
adjusted. While it was there, I told them to change the oil. The bill for all 
of that was ~$120.

I love the explosive starts of the new SS ignition, and the more solid, macho 
output of the alternator at idle. All that, and my bus no longer looks like a 
mosquito-control fogger. Color me happy.

I say I have done these things not to admit stupidity or imply I'm rich, but 
perhaps to help those reading along to feel even better about applying their 
own garage skills. I've said before that compromised physical health keeps me 
from beneath the bus for all but the silly stuff like looking for loose 
change. I've done my own valves on previous buses and look forward to being 
able to do that (and oil changes) at the very least now that I'm dealing with 
a 1600 that hasn't been bastardized and coated with crusty grime.

The esteemed Nikki was kind enough to share several needed parts, among them, 
a replacement for the inside sliding door handle, and some heater knobs to 
serve as cosmetic upgrades for my no-workie heater (heat exchangers missing).

I have replaced the cargo hatch rubber. Yoiks! More big bucks. I got impatient 
and shelled out ~$112 locally for it but it feels like German rubber and 
installed like a breeze without goop--popped right in. I had no baby powder 
for it, so used cornstarch instead. The PO had mucked up the hatch door using 
that worthless sticky weatherstripping in all the wrong places. After fighting 
the residue for several hours, I just gobbed on the cornstarch to tame the 
residual &quot;tack.&quot; This hatch was a *big* leak source and needed attention 
straightaway. The leak has been arrested.

I couldn't imagine a better-sounding, smoother-running 1600 than what's 
pushing me now. I am very happy with what's been done so far and have no 
regrets.

Next Friday, I'll report what's being done (or not done) to the interior and 
it's not at all what you may expect. &lt;G&gt; I have surrendered my apartment, and 
a small sign reading &quot;Home is where the bus is&quot; hangs above the cargo hatch 
door. Although my grown daughter has made a bedroom available, I have lived in 
and slept in the bus this past week working out some kinks in the routine 
using her driveway as a sort of dry-dock.

I plan to be at the Florida Bug Jam in Dade City, FL on November 12th and hope 
to meet one or two of you there. http://www.floridabugjam_dot_com for info. 
[Caution: this looks like a *mega* commercial show and not your typical 
loosely-organized knee-slapping tire-kicking wine-tasting fun-fest. The list 
of *not allowed* is nearly as long as the list of awards and features. See the 
website and judge for yourself.] &lt;sigh&gt;

An &quot;Engine Blow Contest&quot; at 3:45? The flier asks &quot;How long will it run 
full-throttle without oil?&quot; Win Prizes! Egad. What are we teaching our kids 
today! Never mind--rhetorical question. Many kids already know the answer to 
the Engine Blow question and what's really needed is a &quot;Find The Dipstick&quot; 
contest! &lt;BG&gt;

Oh, they'll love me for that bit of editorializing.  Maybe I should show up in 
a Truly Nolan Isuzu and pretend like I was expecting a different sort of 
bug-fest. &lt;G&gt;

Cheers!
