Subject: Bus exemption proof

Please please please can someone assist me..... I have a lovely Vdub bus 
- Westafalia - registered in UK August 1973, however, I do know that she 
was manufacutured in 1972 - Hence I should be exempt from road tax.  
Apparently I need proof  (a 'dealers letter' is not adequate). 

If you can help it would be much appreciated
I'll let you know chassis number etc, at mo I dont have it to hand
Thanks

Rachel
