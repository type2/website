Subject: '66 experiences, travel, etc.

Hi all,

I haven't had time to do much more than scan the Type-2 and Vanagon
lists lately, I like to take my time posting so it had to wait until
I was relaxed and had a little spare time.  (I *have* been reading,
with some jealousy :-), all the trip reports that have been posted
lately, particularly the Inuvik information.)

Weekend before last I drove my '66 to Phoenix to pick up a 6-foot
roof-rack that Joe Nodzak at All-Bug built for me.  I had won a
half-price coupon for this rack at the Flagstaff Arizona Bus Club
outing and had ordered the rack a couple weeks earlier but hadn't
figured out a good time to pick it up.  Well, finally, we needed
to go to Phoenix for Janice's mother's 70 birthday surprise party
anyway so I used the occasion to drive the bus up.  I had Janice
follow me up in the Jetta just in case (I'd never driven the bus
more than a few miles since I've owned it and it has my recently
built new engine in there).

We drove up in the morning on Saturday, picked up the roof rack
from Joe, spent the rest of the day and following night at Janice's
mom's and drove back the next morning *early*.  Both days we left
when it was still dark, prolly around 5 AM to avoid the heat of the
day.  (this also avoids a lot of traffic at least at first.)  I ran
with all the windows open, sides, vent wings and all 6 popouts, sort
of breezy/noisey but nice.  We drove at approx. 55 MPH the whole
way and the engine ran like a charm.  At that speed on I-10 I feel
like I'm in a time-warp driving along taking my time in the 1960s
while the 1990s roar by me at 80+ MPH.  Not a bad feeling!

Inspired by that trip, I'm planning on going photographing/camping
this Labor Day weekend with Janice and J.C. the beagle, I'll try
to report here on that trip also.

Another trip we took recently was to Yosemite and the Oregon coast
but we didn't take the bus, 3400 miles in the '87 Jetta.  However,
there were a couple VW points of interest.  

1. We camped a few days at Tuolumne Meadows campground and I saw three
   different split-window busses running around up there, proof that old
   busses can survive at 9000 feet above sea-level. (and make it up
   there!)

2. I had a recently installed alternater fail (diodes) up north of
   Cresent City, California and had it swapped out in Coos Bay, Oregon.
   There aren't any VW dealers in the smaller towns, even towns
   big enough to have Volvo dealers and all the Japanese car dealers
   often failed to have VW dealers.  (Very small towns have US-car
   dealers!).  So I had the work done by Marty Slechta at &quot;Second
   Street Foreign Car Service&quot; there in Coos Bay.  When he heard that
   I was traveling, he postponed some other work he was doing so that
   he could fix my car right away.  I watched him do the work and it
   was very careful yet quick.  I was so happy, I told him I'd mention
   his shop on the Internet!  (here it is)  Marty showed me an early
   60's crew cab out behind the shop that he said he was getting ready
   to restore so I figure his shop would be good for both air-cooled
   and water-cooled V-Dubs.

3. I drove through Tehachapi Ca. on the way home.  This is where the
   long block I'm running in the '66 was built at Mark Stephen's shop.
   Its a nice area in the mountains just before you drop into the
   Mojave going east on California 58.  I didn't have time to stop.

About Inuvik.  Sounds like it was a great trip!  Also sounds like an
exercise in sleep deprivation for a lot of the people involved!  When
I travel, I almost always get 8 hours sleep per night and I like to
get an early start (leave around 7 AM).  I don't think I would have
seen much of the other members of the group on that trip!  I very
much hope that I get a chance to test this theory however.

I'm hoping Bob's Baja trip happens.  I've been wanting to spend some
time exploring the Pinicate area of Sonora along the Camino del Diablo
near the US-Mexico border and need some Mexico experience with someone
familier with traveling down there.  (Also, the starting point isn't
far from Tucson!)

Lemme see, that's about all for now.  The next thing for the '66
is to replace the window and door rubber along with the head-liner.
Any suggestions about these things would be appreciated.  I'm
planning to get the rubber from West Coast Metric and the headliner
from TMI.

Cheers,

 -Dyer
