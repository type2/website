Subject: More 72 backfiring...(Progressive help needed...)

Well...a quick update on the 72's backfiring:

Timing dead on 28 degrees (total....), dwell at 48, compression is
125-120-115-125, so I guess all i've got left is the carb....Now if only
I can find a damn kit for it....*sigh*

Guess i'll do a seat-of-the-pants rebuild, with custom gaskets, and the
ol' knobfidlin tuning......:)

Anybody got a rebuild kit for this Weber carb?  The number across the
bottom read:    32/36DFAV	23A 3M/22

And you know what...I went to verify these numbers again, and could'nt
find the word &quot;Weber&quot; on it after all.  Odd.  I woulda SWORE...maybe it
was the main jet that had Weber written on it....

Anyhow.  Any and all help appreciated, as well as suggestions of WHY it
backfires....(to recap:  runs, if you hold it at 2500 or so RPM, but will
shoot a 4 inch flame out the exhaust every now and then...AND,
occasionally thwut up the carb throat....Cant find any vac leaks, either.
Disconnected the brake boosted and pluged the line (close...:) to be sure
there, too....)

later....david
