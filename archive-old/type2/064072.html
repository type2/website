Subject: red spray paint.....  and an unrelated comment front tire mounts

Before I head to rustland, Im trying to cover all the small open spots of
metal on my bus (not to mention the large open spots from where they pulled
the front end out after the little incident with a cadilac.) any suggestions
on a spray paint for a 1970 Red west.I got some that was supposed to be close
but it wasy to hot. I plan on using on the nose (which will be replaced
asap.)

When I hit the cadilac, the spare tire took the force of the blow, it was
torn mount and all from the front of the VW and shot 40 yards away, landed
rolling and went another hundred yards. The bulge in the nose for the head
light was less then 1&quot; from my foot after the accident. Remarkably the bus
was drivable, and no one was hurt. Ive been fairly ambivilant about front
tire mounts in the past (this car came with it) but Im a convert now.
