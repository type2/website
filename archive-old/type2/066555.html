Subject: Re: VW CD - Defeat?

&gt;        Might not be a bad idea to mention college kids. The aircooled VW
&gt;has always been a very popular vehicle for the college crowd-and guess
&gt;what? They've all got cd-rom access in the school lab.

Okay but now it's getting funny. Here's how it goes when Hooper does it:

Be fixing bus. Have diagnosis problem. Too many variables. Become
frustrated. Climb out. Flip through manual. Smoke. Drink beer. Pace. Think
about asking list. Flip. Smoke. Drink. Curse. Ask list. Expect response
within thirty seconds. Don't get it. Curse. Smoke. Think.

(Add: hike across campus. Load CD. Try to find relevant bits. Get black
grease all over keyboard. Hear lab assistants whispering about you. Wish
you could smoke. Notice security person whispering with lab assistants.
Click madly through trying to find your particular problem which is never,
ever in there. Periodically wipe keyboard with elbow. Print something out
to prove you are not an insane homeless person.)

Figure it out from your own head. Check mail. Four replies. Note that three
replies are incorrect but well-intentioned, one is right but you already
know that. Go back and fix bus.
