It's such a slight difference that it should be within the range of
adjustability.

&gt;Also I noticed there is a difference in rear brake shoes during the 73 model
&gt;year (my bus year) at chassis number 213 210 2497.  My bus is 233 210 0455.  I
&gt;have read several accounts of VW going back and forth around the chassis
&gt;number switch to get rid of parts so..... Does any one know how to tell the
&gt;difference in the two different shoes?

I would like to know the answer to this too.  I seem to remember that at
one point in time, the rear brake shoes and drums became wider.  Was it the
1980 model year?  Can you swap wider shoes and drums from a Vanagon to a
loaf?
