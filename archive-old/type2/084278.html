Subject: Re: [T2] windshield wiper fluid question?

Hi, all, and happy bussing to all! As to an electric solution to the
windshield spritzer, go to the parts yard and find an Audi 4k, 5k or VW
quantum. the washer tank and motor are a great choice, easy to figure
out wiring and can be had for 5-10 bux, maybe even free if you talk a
good game or know someone! 
The switch: I haven't tried this, but you may be able to mount a
micro-switch in the column, in place of the original hose
arrangement???? Try it.

My .02 1/2.

Chris.
