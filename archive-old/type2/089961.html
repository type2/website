&gt; &gt;Apparently the #1 exhaust valve
&gt; &gt;guide failed and entered the cylinder
&gt;=20
&gt; Where did the VALVE ( spring, keepers, etc.) GO ?
&gt; You have left out a critical piece of information.

The valve stayed put, looks like some of the guide got
mashed between the valve and the seat.  I'll try to
get some pics up this evening.

&gt;=20
&gt; &gt;As for the head, the valve area of the head looks
&gt; &gt;OK, the pounded valve guide material was beaten into the
&gt; &gt;lower surface, not apparently into the valves.  Think this
&gt; &gt;could be fixed?  Is my piston salvagable?
&gt;=20
&gt; Oversize valve guides are available.
&gt; Take both heads to a vw machinist.
&gt; Destroyed pistons make good ashtrays.

Can you buy just 1 piston?  I'm half tempted to take
a chisel and/or grinder to this one and see what's left after removing
the flattened guide material. =20

&gt;=20
&gt; &gt;Does this mean that the entire engine (78 2.0 FI) needs to=20
&gt; be rebuilt?
&gt;=20
&gt; No. But you previously stated you had found metal
&gt; and a lot of sludge in the strainer, and that will require
&gt; case disassembly and inspection of bearings. So, Yes.

Well, the sludge was caked inside the strainer cap,=20
not in the strainer itself.

&gt;=20
&gt; &gt;Another option is, I have a complete 1700 w/single Weber
&gt; &gt;with a purported broken crank, and another 1700 used longblock
&gt; &gt;(worked when last ran, no rings.)  I think I could take these
&gt; &gt;2 engines and make 1 pretty cheaply, maybe that will last me
&gt; &gt;until I can afford the AVP.
&gt;=20
&gt; Disassemble both cores and inventory good components.
&gt; Then price additional parts and survey your capabilities.
&gt; Do you really want to know how to build an engine ?

I'd love to build one, but right now I'm trying to get this
bus on the road as cheaply as possible until I have saved enough
for a proper rebuild.  I'd prefer to learn to rebuild on my type I
so if I get something wrong, I'm not thrashing expensive type IV
parts. Problem is I can't get started on the type I until I get
this bus running.  Before I start splitting the 1700 cases, I'm tempted
to try to get one going by going through the top end.  I'm a former
small engine mech, so I believe I'm capable, and have most of the
needed tools, just short on time and $$.

Thanks,

Rob
