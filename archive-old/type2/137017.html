Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with possible engine purchase

 &gt;&gt;I've seen a few positive comments in this forum on Megasquirt. I
 &gt;&gt;visited the
 &gt;&gt;megasquirt website, but found it rather intimidating. Has anyone
 &gt;&gt;worked this
 &gt;&gt;out for our VW bus application?

The megasquirt rules.  If you're a bus purist, then keep your L-Jet.  If 
you want to actually be able to tune your bus, go with the MS.  It is 
definately a project, but you'll learn a hell of a lot about fuel 
injection theory and it's really cool to have the best running bus around!

 &gt;&gt; Does anyone sell a complete solution?

not really.  There are people that will build the ecu for you, but you 
still need to make the cables and stuff like that.  That is probably the 
most difficult part.  Then you also need to find places for sensors and 
things like that.

However, once you get all the wires run, if you've got an L-Jet system 
it's pretty simple to make the mod.  I just used all the existing 
injectors and stuff and cut up an old l-jet harness and plug everything in.
