Subject: Re: [T2] painting an engine

Mike,
I rebuilt my type IV and powdercoated the tin and extras. I left the case
alone but you could easily paint this with myriad colors available for
engines. Works and looks great .

Subject: [T2] painting an engine


&gt; So, now that I've got my engine out (fixing a bad piston), I want to
&gt; repaint the tin, intake runners, cooling ducts, manifold and anything
&gt; else that needs painting (not case, heads, or cylinders).
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to have a nice hard finish that is going to resist flaking and
&gt; also be able to handle the temps in the engine compartment.  What would
&gt; be my best bet (paint type, brands, etc) to finish these parts?  I'm
&gt; going to degrease them and sandblast them first to get them clean and
&gt; smooth..
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
