Subject: 74 Bus --Carburetor problems?

I have a 74 bus with a carburetor conversion kit added
to it.....

i just bought the bus and for the last year it didnt
really run that much

noticed a strong gas smell and gas dripping from the
carburetor....

anyone know the cause? doesnt seem to be coming from
the fuel lines but the carburetor itself...

any help would be very much appreciated

thanks
chris miller
