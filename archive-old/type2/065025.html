&gt;Then bail. Fold. Get out while you still can. Seriously, you do not do a
&gt;full resto on a car with limited collector appeal and expect to break even
&gt;or even close to even. You can get an excellent bus that somebody *else*
&gt;took a bath on for a third of what you're going to dump into that money pit
&gt;of yours.

My brotherinlaw who is into antique cars says to buy a restored car, because
you can buy them restored for far less than it costs to restore them. 

Interestingly enough, I've discovered a place near here that is an exclusive 
VW only restoration shop. They had a Ghia there that they had put $8000.00
worth of work into. Although it wasn't perfect, it was close. From underneath, 
it looked like it had just rolled off the boat! The fellow said that it would
take a few more thousand to get every detail right for it to be perfect, but 
the owner did not want to spend those last few thousand. 
He mentioned that had just finished a convertible bug restoration which they had
put $18,000.00 work of work into. He said the owner got it for $2000.00, or
so, and when they were done, it was worth $25,000.00.
He also mentioned the reason the place is hard to find, is if it was easy
to find, they would have too much work, and he already had 60hr/wk worth of work
for all teh employees.
