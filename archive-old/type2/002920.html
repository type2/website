EGR is 'exhaust gas recirculation'. In order to lower the 3rd pollutant, NoX
[oxides of nitrogen], inert exhaust gas in introduced into the combustion
chamber to lower combustion temps. Oxides of nitrogen form above 2500 F
degrees.
Next to your left heater box is a egr filter that bolts to the U pipe on the
end of the transverse pipe. This filter has a habit of rusting away and
causing an exhaust leak. It is a square metal can with a 1/2'' tube on each
end. The lower pipe goes to the flange and the upper goes to the upper
cylinder tin where it meets another tube [usually grey]. This tube then goes
to the EGR valve mounted to the left front corner of the plenum.

this....... I know.... it is a stupid questiion. but I need to know...
&gt; Thanks,
