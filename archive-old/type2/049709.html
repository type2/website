Subject: re: [T2] Where are cheap + cool campsites

In addition to the overnight camping fee, some states
also charge a park admission fee to enter and use a
state park. This fee can be much more for out of state
users than for vehicles licensed in the state that the
park is in.
I'm not sure if this is true in all states, but it is
something to consider when looking for low-buck camp
sites.
