Subject: Penetrol info

Hello to all you Type2 folks far and wide,
    to the Limbo List where ever you may be
       and to Bus Alliance members who are near by,

    With all the recent talk, on the type2 list, of the virtues of Penetrol
for our fiberglass pop tops I just thought I'd give you a heads up.  While
at my local Home Depot this morning I noticed that they sold Penetol in a
quart can for $6.97 plus tax.  I guess I'll give the stuff a try as soon as
I get a chance.
