Hi Volks!

&gt; So I need the list's expertise. How much weight could I pull with a '73 VW
&gt; Bus? I'm thinking of one of the hitch types that replaces the bumper

Legally in Germany, 1,200 kg's fine (i.e., legal limit for
Type 1 engines, and possible with any legal hitch), and 
1,800 kg is possible (with a Type 4 engine and the hitch to
match).

HTH,
