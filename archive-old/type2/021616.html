Hi -

Does anyone know if a Brosol fuel pump (part #113 127 025BCD) 
will work on a '71 bus?  I got it at my local VW parts store along with 
a bunch of other stuff yesterday and didn't check it before I left, and 
the store won't be open till Tuesday.  It looks like the fuel pump for 
'63-70 buses (#113 127 025B), not like the one currently on my bus, 
which you see as the standard replacement (113 127 025D).  So 
my question is, does the &quot;BCD&quot; at the end Brosol pump number 
signify (correctly) that it can be used on the earlier and later buses? 
 
Thanks - Dan
