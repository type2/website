...Yes. Quite often, you are given the COMPRESSOR hp WITH the MOTOR hp - in
other words, your motor is 2hp, but the compressor itself is 1 hp; forget
whether this is supposed to be how much power it would produce if it was an
engine, and not a compressor, or some function related to the actual
compression of air.
My air/hydraulic guy calls my Sears 60 gallon 6 hp a 'fake 6' because it is
really a 5, at best. It DOES do what I ask of it, but when sandblasting, i
need to let it catch up every five minutes. It has hours in the low
'teen-thousands' on it and has never given me a lick of trouble.
I would like a bigger tank, but otherwise, this is the minimum size
compressor even a hobbyist should get.

AND NEVER GET AN OILLESS! As you've found out.
