Subject: Distributor without Muir's Notch
Message-ID: &lt;3736ea82Distributor without Muir's Notch*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Ok, yesterday I went to adjust the valves on my 1600 dp engine and I had 
trouble
&gt;finding finding the firing position on the
&gt;distributor for the first cylinder.  
&gt;As the subject says the distributor doesnt have the wonderful notch as is 
shown in the idiots
&gt;guide. 

It's unusual that there would be no notch. It's more common for the notch to 
be nowhere near where you think it should be. You
don't need the notch to find top dead center for #1 (see Muir), once your 
there, clean the rim of the distributor with solvent until
you find the notch, then swing it around until it lines up with the rotor 
notch.
