Subject: Re: Hand Cranking a Bus

 Forgive my ignorance, but huh?
Are you hand cranking an early (earlier than I  heard of) bus 
that has this as an original equipment set up, or using an 
aftermarket widget that you added on?  The 1600 cc thingy 
makes me think the latter is more probable.  If so, I want 
one!

&gt;Today I was changine the oil on the bus, and sez what the
&gt;hey, I'll put the hand crank stuff on, its only been laying
&gt;around for 9 months or so...
&gt;
&gt;So, I installed the nut and tin, put everything back
&gt;together, and gave it a whirl.  It worked!  
&gt;
&gt;This engine is a 1600 single port, with 25,000 miles on it.
&gt;
&gt;The only &quot;kick back&quot; I got was some resistance when I prolly
&gt;got close to tdc on compression.
&gt;
&gt;It only takes one turn of the crank to start the motor,
&gt;heres's how I do it:
&gt;
&gt;turn key on and set the brake. make sure its out of gear!
&gt;
&gt;prop open the engine lid
&gt;
&gt;kneeling facing the passenger side, insert the crank thru
&gt;the slot and engage the nut.  
&gt;
&gt;using both hands on top of the crank, thumbs outside, start
&gt;cranking.  The trick is to sense the compression and give a
&gt;little extra oomph right at that point.
&gt;
&gt;If you get her to start, the crank will automatically stop
&gt;moving, and you can very carefully extract it.  If not, try
&gt;again.
&gt;
&gt;It really helps to have a well-tuned engine!
