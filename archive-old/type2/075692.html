Subject: Re: [T2] Welding your VW-braizing?

&gt; Brazing a panel hole shut? I'd be worried about trapping flux in an
&gt; inaccessible part of the panel (flux is corrosive if you don't get it off).
&gt; If you can get all of the flux off the panel, brazing should work well.

or use a non corrosive flux.
