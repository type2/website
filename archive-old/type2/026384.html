Subject: Brake Servo Questions -'73 Bus
Date: Mon, 26 Oct 1998 10:58:23 -0500

All,

I've recently replaced my brake booster servo with a rebuilt one (H&amp;R
Boosters in Dallas).  Now when I press the brake pedal I get an INCREASE in
engine RPM.  Also, I don't really sense greatly improved stopping power (as
opposed to before the rebuilt servo when my old one was full of brake
fluid/torn diaphram) Should this be happening?  I have searched the archives
and found several instances where people press on the pedal and get an RPM
DECREASE - from what I read this is indicative of a leaky diaphram in the
servo - but no real discussion of an RPM Increase.  I don't think I've got a
leaky diaphram because I'm not experiencing the dreaded &quot;phantom brake
fluid&quot; problem - at least not yet :)

I haven't checked the one-way valve or the flexible hose that connects the
servo to the manifold yet.  Could this be a problem?

Also, how many seals are there between the servo and the master cylinder?
When I look at mine I count 1 - there is one built into the mounting flange
of the master cylinder.  I look at my Haynes manual at the picture on page
127 and there also appears to be only 1.  If I am missing an additional seal
could this be the source of the RPM increase?

For the record, I've replaced/rebuilt:

Brake Booster Servo
Master Cylinder
All Flexible Brake Lines
Front Calipers
Rear Wheel Cylinders

Any advise/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
