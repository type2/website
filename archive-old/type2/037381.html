Peter -

I would agree with the second dealership - that seal is critical to keeping
and engine at the correct operating temperature - winter or summer.

Where the oil came from may or not be related to the seal problem.

In either case, the first dealership screwed up, and whoever told you that
is was okay to drive the bus w/o that seal should pay for everything -
towing included.

Good luck -

&gt; Thank you all for your responses. Sorry but this one is a bit longer.
&gt;
&gt; I have a 1979 FI 2000cc engine.
&gt; The whole story is that I had the engine rebuilt by a VW dealer but the
&gt; engine compartment seal was not put in for some reason. I had to have the
&gt; van shipped to me as I didn't have the time to go get it and I had moved
&gt; provinces while it was being worked on. When I got the van I noticed the
&gt; seal was missing and contacted the dealer. They said it didn't matter for
&gt; now but it should be replaced before the summer. Anyways I was taking my
van
&gt; on a trip and noticed a slight lack of power and I needed to add some oil
&gt; but there was no visible oil leak. Then I lost about 50% power so I pulled
&gt; off and found that oil was splattered all on the engine centered around
from
&gt; the fan. I had it towed to another VW dealership where they did a
&gt; compression test and the results were 13, 40, 55, 60 psi for all the
&gt; cylinders. The engine itself has a 1 year/20000 km warranty on it and I've
&gt; driven maybe 3000km since the rebuilt was put in. So now the problem is
that
&gt; the second dealership refuses to do the warranty work on the engine
because
&gt; they claim the missing engine seal caused the engine to overheat. But I
&gt; would have to tow the van 600 miles to take it back to the original VW
&gt; dealer to have the work done (and the thought of them doing it is not too
&gt; reassuring).
&gt; Basically what I am trying to find out is, did the missing engine
&gt; compartment seal solely cause the engine to overheat. Or given the above
&gt; scenario could it have been something that failed mechanically?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you to those who took the time to read this post, and I would
&gt; appreciate any help.
