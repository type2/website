*** Hope this only posts once, my mail server was acting strange ***

Fishbowl,
I agree with most of Clara's post, and I'm sure she's done more of these
than I (but I've done a hell uv a lot uv 'em).

My first comment is to use lots of WD40, CRC, or some such penetrating
lube. Tapping on the stars like Clara suggests should break them loose,
but don't destroy the tines on the stars. With WD and ChannelLock
pliers, I've usually been able to loosen the stars from the backing
plate. If this doesn't work, I've considered threading in a longer bolt
to force the star out (assuming you can get the slotted, adjusting bolt
out). I've never had to do this, so I'm not sure how it will work.

When you get the adjusting bolts out, clean the threads with a small
wire brush. One of those little gun-barrel cleaning brushes is good for
the inside threads.

I differ in opinion with Clara on the use of grease. I use paste wax,
preferably Johnson's, but Turtle Wax will work. Put it everywhere Clara
recommends grease; it will dry on and not collect dirt and brake dust
like grease will. It will still lube and protect from rust. Every time
the wheel is off, disassemble the adjuster assy, clean, and re-lube (I
recommend this whether using wax or grease).

Grease is great, but wax or graphite are often better in places that are
not protected by a dust seal. Although, Clara's apparent excitement over
grease _does_ pique my curiosity! :)

My two cents worth-

&gt; Adjusting stars are stuck stuck stuck on my

-SNIP-
&gt; So I'm off monday to buy new cylinders of course,
&gt; do they come with the adjusters?  Or any ideas how
&gt; to take the adjusters off?  ('69 model)

&gt; take the old stars off the bus.   use a hammer and a battered screwdriver- tap
&gt; the screwdriver on the edge of the star to get them of the bit on the backing
&gt; plate.  Take a propane torch to them then dunk them in a bucket of water.  It
&gt; should sizzle.   DO this a couple times, then put a thick screwdriver in the
&gt; bit where the brake shoes go, and a vise grip on the star bit and unscrew it.
&gt; If it doesn't move, torch it again.  Vise grips are good for holding it while
&gt; you torch it actually.    When they move, completely unscrewthem, and grease
&gt; the threads before putting them back together.  grease the bit the stars go
&gt; in.  Heck, I even grease the bit the shoe goes in.
&gt; 
&gt; This should be done whenever you do brake work on your bus.
&gt; 
&gt; GREASE is your buses FRIEND   : ) :)   grease good.  I love grease.   :) :o)
&gt; grease grease :)
