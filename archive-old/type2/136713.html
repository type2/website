Subject: Heater Controls

I've had my bus for a few years, most of that time
sitting in my yard with a bad fuel pump or something
else that leads to procrastination.  Since I got it I
had a problem with gasoline odors in the cabin.  I
looked around for solutions like sealing the engine
compartment, sealing spaces around the cabin (in the
back mostly), etc, but again procrastinated and just
lived with it.

My bus has none of the original heater stuff except
the levers and maybe the ducts.  Fans, heat
exchangers, etc, are gone.  When I got it, the heater
control levers were in the up position.  I just
assumed they were supposed to stay there so I never
even bothered to play with them.  I know I'll sound
like an idiot, but one day I was driving along,
smelled gas, pulled the levers down, and WALLA!!, no
gas smell.  I felt really stupid, but now my bus
smells good.  

The left one is the heater control, the middle one is
the heat distribution lever, the right one is fresh
air.  Gotta love those Germans...KR
