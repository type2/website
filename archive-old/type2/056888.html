I have been trying to correct the lack of power and jerking problem on my 75
fuel injected bus without success.  I am attempting to check the intake air
sensor.  The manual says 200 to 400 ohms at pins #6 and #9.  I have borrowed
an ohm meter but don't know what ohm setting to use RX1, RX10 OR RX1K.  As you
can tell I have little elect. knowledge.  If this is not the problem, I don't
know what else to try.
