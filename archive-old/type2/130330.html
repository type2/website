&gt;Where to makers of aftermarket parts (for example; fuel pumps, sensors, wheel 
&gt;cylinders) get their specifications?  Do they reverse engineer OE parts? Do 
&gt;they obtain specifications from the OEM?  Do they merely re-label parts from 
&gt;other makers?  Also, I kinda remember something about the OEMs being legally 
&gt;required to provide specifications to aftermarket makers?  Anyone know about how
&gt;this works?

I'm sure &quot;all of the above&quot; applies.
