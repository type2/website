Sorry to hear your woes, I can't say I agree with the attitude displayed on
the list, Friday or not.
I think we were all kicking our selves, 2 months ago, when a list member met
more than he could handle &amp; ended his own life.

As I remember the general feeling was &quot;I only we had known&quot; or &quot;I wish he
had shared with us&quot;. Now that is a reality, we complain about the time spent
connected to our ISP! I have to pay for ALL my calls local or not &amp; don't se
the problem. You may not have included R.B.C
but what the hell, no one deserves to be flamed for dealing with a personal
problem. That's all.

&lt;Soap box mode = OFF&gt;
