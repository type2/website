Subject: Coating for rubber parts

Yesterday I applied a coating of liquid &quot;Plasti-Dip&quot;, in black, to my window 
gaskets and rubber. This stuff is designed to create plastic handles on 
tools, cover rope ends, etc., etc., etc. I used a small artists paintbrush, 
and just painted it on my rubber. I brushed the rubber off first with a stiff 
brush, and blew the dust off. Any that gets on the paint just easily rubs off 
with a finger after it's dry, or you can rub it with a rag when still wet. I 
have also tried &quot;Liquid Electrical Tape&quot; for this, and it works also. It 
fills those cracks and crevices, and I even ran it over onto the glass on my 
fixed windows, to help seal. The sun here in St. Pete is murder on 
everything, and I have to replace my wipers four or five times a year because 
of uv degradation. I can just imagine what a complete set of gaskets for all 
my glass would run every year or so. No Thank You.  Both of these products 
are available at Home Depot or Lowes or wherever.  I would advise, if you try 
it, a cool day [yeah, right] in the shade, and keep a little bit of mineral 
spirits or laquer thinner on hand to thin with if it gets thick on you. It 
skins over in the can real quick on a hot day, so ya gotta stir it a lot. It 
goes on a little goopy if it's real hot out,[like here yesterday-95*] but 
lays out after it cures. From more than a couple of feet away, my rubber 
looks almost new. Up close and personal, you can see that something has been 
done. Costs about 5 to 6 bucks a can. It's a rubber based product, either 
genuine or synthetic, and doesn't seem to have hurt my rubber any, but then 
most of my rubber is 24 years old, so whats the diff? 
Usual disclaimers, and don't blame me if yer all thumbs.... but it might 
help, and it'll save ya a few bucks.  Haven't tried it on fuel lines, and 
won't. Rain and sun  is one thing, gas is another thing altogether.  
Although, I did use &quot;Tuff Coat&quot; on my pickup truck to seal a hose/tank joint 
that was leaking, and it worked. Also available in the Paint dept. of just 
about anybody.
