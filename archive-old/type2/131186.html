Subject: Electric fuel pump location?

Hello,

My mechanical fuel pump, on my 72 van (1700), has just died and I have 
decided to go with an electric one. Where is a good location for it?

My only concern is drilling some anchor holes in the frame for the electric 
pump. I would like to avoid this. Any good locations?


thanks in advance, Phil.
