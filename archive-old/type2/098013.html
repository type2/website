Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Valve Covers:

&gt;&gt;Think about it.  The reason that it feels cooler to the touch is that
it
&gt;&gt;isn't transmitting as much heat through the metal to you. 

Depends on design, if you had a finned heat sink on hot device 3' long,
chances are the heat would be dissapated by the time it ever got to the
end of the fins.  I believe that fins have been used in certain
applcations to lower the temperature of the surface that can actually be
touched.

Make no dougt about it, aluminum is more thermally (and electically)
conductive than steel.


&gt;They transmit heat well, they flex a bit to conform to the gasket
surface, and they were
&gt; heap to make.

True, but mainly cheap to make,   All the 4 cylinders cars that I have
aluminum valve covers, er except the Vanagon. Heck, the 2002 V6 Odyssey
probably has them as well, but I don't really open that hood very much!

Anyone out there want to weld some fins to the steel covers (except those
darn bails get in the way) and see if the head temps go down?

Happy bussing,
John R
