&lt;&lt; On the lower mount, however.... this is a stud that is pressed into the
lower arm.  Guard that stud with your life!  If you shear it, you are off
to a machinist with the lower trailing arm in hand, after having torn
major bits of the front apart.  it is, fortunately, right out in the open.
This is rust, and all is fair in rust, even thing you would not do in love
nor war.  Hit it with penetratng oil, hit it with heat, even grind major
bits of the nut away, but save that stud!
 &gt;&gt;

Another tip: After soaking in P B Blaster (my preference, YMMV),
try putting a socket and breaker bar on the nut and giving it a
goodly rap clock-wise before attempting to loosen it.

You're chucking the shock anyway; cut the ring surrounding the
rubber on the shock to remove the shock from the stud. This 
gives you clearance around the nut for a nut-buster if it comes
to that.
