Well it would seem that the thermostat doesn't have enough travel to let my
flaps go through their complete motion, even though the thermostat bellows
is using all the room it can in the mounting bracket. Accordingly I have
made sure the flaps open fully when the bellows are expanded, and they are
partially (about 1/2) closed when the bellows is fully contracted. Am I
missing something? It would seem I should have more travel, but there is no
way, so I erred on the side of open. I'd appreciate any input on this.
Everything is the correct parts, I haven't changed anything from
dis-assembly.
Thanks,
Courtney
