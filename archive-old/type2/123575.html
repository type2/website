Subject: Re: [T2] How to store a bay wind shield

i have a 75 nose cut off on the property. perfect fit. duct tape
criss-crossed and i'm hoping to install it in the 69er when i get it
running this week. how trashy is that? needing two fellers with a strong
back and a weak mind to help haul that around the side.   -steve
