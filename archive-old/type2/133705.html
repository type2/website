Subject: Re: [T2] Disabled bus-driver

Thanks for the links on the euro-controls.  They look pretty crazy, but 
neat.  I've got a set of regular, automatic trans. handcontrols on  my '03 
Ford van and a set of portables for rent-a-wrecks, so it's just the manual 
trans. controls that have peeked my interest.

Thanks again,

Chris
