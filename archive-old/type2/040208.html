Subject: Calid-fornia Show &amp; Swap!!!!!

Sacramento Bug-O-Rama Next Sunday May 28th _at_ Sacramento Raceway!  

Swap, Show, Drag Racing (dressing up in women's clothes and driving real
fast has never appealed to me)

All proceeds go to benefit the Bob Hole Fund for Disadvantaged Cal Look
Kiddies and New Beetle Wannabes!

I'll be there with both buses!
