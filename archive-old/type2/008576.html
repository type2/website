Hi,

The interior of the bus is stripped clean and everything is disasembled and
stashed in the basement. I am trying to figure out something and hope
someone with a 69 to 71 or so Westy can take a measuremt for me. I need to
know the amount of space between the end of the bed ( in sleeping
configuration) and the edge of the jumpseat. 

Many Thanks,0
Chris
