I agree with Dr. Tim.

Anything's possible, but the most likely cause of the brushes wearing so
rapidly is a rough commutator.

You can pull the generator and tidy up the commutator yourself, or have a
local auto electric shop do the job with their lathe and undercutting tool.
This will only work if the commutator isn't too badly worn and hasn't
started tossing solder.  If the commutator is worn out and/or any
re-soldering has to be done the only realistic option is to go with a
replacement Bosch reman. generator.

I expect your interest in switching to an alternator has to do with all the
radio gear you're running in your bus.  The added expense and complexity of
an alternator retrofit at this juncture are issues only you can decide.

Keep us posted.....
