Ok. this is it.

i'm headed for arizona on friday, with the intention of buying a westy and
driving it home. A friend is going to be in Durango, CO and i was thinking
of driving by to see her on the way out. this alters my original plan,
which was to skirt south of colorado, and stick to I-40 most of the way to
the east coast.

In any case, I'm wondering if anyone here has ever driven Rt 160 through
southern Colorado, which runs right through the southern rockies. I've
never been to that part of the country, so i have no idea what to expect.
Are these pretty slow-going routes? Once i'm on the other side of the
rockies, it's a very straight, flat ride through the midwest. but i'm
wondering if what looks a pretty short distance on the map is actually a
lot slower 'cause of the mountains. [and the westy].

thanks,
-perry
