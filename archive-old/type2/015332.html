&gt;You said that the DM will reduce your cost per mile.  Part of the DM as
&gt;stated by you previously is replacing parts at regular intervals,
&gt;presumably whether they need to be replaced or not.  That is not cost
&gt;effective IMO.

Well, that's not what I intended to say, certainly. If memory serves, I gave
that as an example of BOOK maintenance, which my method attempts to enhance
and IMPROVE. In the 80's and prior, Volvo said to fully disassemble the
brakes, clean them, and reassemble them every 4 years or 40,000 miles.
I think that is superciliously safety overkill. But, how many deaths per
million miles do they have in Sweden????

The idea is to replace
the parts when by inspection they show they are creaping up on the wear curve
to the point where they might fail before the next inspection. Read some of
my latter posts. Keeping the fluids clean at all times will stretch that
wear cure WAAAAAAAAAAY out.

 and replace
&gt;them at your convience BEFORE they fail.

&gt;So we agree on that.

&gt;If you agree with my above statements, Yes.

&gt;Cost per mile in my mind includes
&gt;the lost day from work, the tow charge, the failed brakes that resulted in
&gt;two totaled vehicles, three dead and one maimed for life and on permanent
&gt;dissablilty with the associated attorneys fees and court costs. Far far more
&gt;expensive that flushing the brake fluid every year or two for the life of
&gt;a centarian.

&gt;What I heard you to say is that you wait for the brakes to start leaking
&gt;before you think about servicing them. Please clarify if that is not the
&gt;case.

&gt;I'm sure you will agree that that's an extreme case, and I certainly don't
&gt;condone ignoring one's brakes.  I was talking about tune up parts. 

Yes, death is extreme, and it happens every day on the road. Next to drunks,
I would venture to guess that lack of inspections causes the next most number
of deaths and injurys on the road. Half the cars in America could not be
certified
by required inspection to operate in Germany.

I address &quot;tune ups&quot;, which I don't do, in another post. Please go back to
this evenings commentary. Can't find the words in most European factory
manuals.

&gt; As for
&gt;tow, lost time from work, none of that happens if you bring spare parts.
&gt;We were comparing the DM vs. carrying spares and waiting till they break.

That's the two extremes, reality lies somewhere in the middle for most of
us which leaves a large margin for improvement. The lowest cost per mile
is not in the middle. It is at the conservative end.

Which spare parts?? Do you carry every part that can strand you&gt; Or just the
ones you haven't inspected since Moses???????? Just the ones that typically
fail from lack of inspection????? Or just the ones that cannot be easily
inspected????? I say inspect them ALL, periodically, keep notes, NEVER
break down. Replace them only when they show they have lived a good and
dutiful life. Or, if that's too much for you and you never want to break
down, use the generic rule of thumb intervals provided by the book schedules.

&gt;The rate I recommend is the rate of optimum efficientcy (VALUE).

&gt;Okay.  All I'm saying is that I think you are a little north of the point
&gt;of optimum efficiency.

Opinions vary. I service some 200 vehicles a year. If you service more or
less,
your opinion can differ. No strain here that I can see.

&gt;Those who
are not after that have the left mouse button in their control. Use it and
send this trash to the dump if that is what you think it is. I just hope
they don't run into me because they ignored the sticking throttle cable
&gt;cause it hadn't broke yet.

&gt;I never advocated ignoring parts that are obviously not working as they
&gt;should.  That is unfair.

I am advocated not waiting for parts to become obviously near death. I say
monitor those parts so you can effectively anticipate their loss of
efficientcy. Monitoring your gas usage is a part of it. If you see that
your milage has dropped 3 miles per gallon, it's empirative evidence of
reduced combustion efficientcy. Check your plugs. Worn more than 0.2mm?
Replace them, get your gas milage back. You can't do that unless you
note your milage and fill up stats. Is it wasteful to throw away good
parts?? Yes. Is it wasteful to pollute the atmosphere with 10% more
co than a clean combustion will give??? Yes. Where is the line of optimum
efficientcy?? I don't know fer shur but I got a pretty good idea of the
general vicinity, and I try to error on the side of safety.

You have every right to your opinion, as do I. This is America and we do
the freedom thing to the nth degree. Free to be irresponsible and get
away with it if we can. This is what I say adds heavily to the death
statistics. That's just one man's opinion from one unique set of 
experiences. Experiences vary, therefore, opinions will vary. 

I am not much
interested in my attorney's opinion on auto maintenance. I doubt if he
is much interested in my opinon of the law. But I don't second guess
his opinion on the law. I listen when that is the subject. Likewise, he
doesn't second guess my opinion on auto maintenance. When that is the 
subject, he shuts his mouth and opens his ears. We have differing opinions
on both but we both recognize our own personal limitations.

By far the best questions so far on this string, David.

Thank you for the feedback.
