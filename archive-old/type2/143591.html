Subject: VW Bus For Sale, Boston, MA

I have a 1973 VW Sufari Style Camper Bus for Sale:

1800cc Engine
4 Speed Manual Transmission
Camper with Refrigerator, Stove, Sink set up
Fold out bed
Radio/Tape Deck sound system
Heat still works (for whatever worth that is!)
Dual Battery with Inverter set yup
Original side mounted Canvass for camping
Red with a white top

Body in very good shape, some rust underneath, minimal rot

Will need a new engine soon, piston #3 is in rough shape, still driveable.

Asking $1500 or best offer.
