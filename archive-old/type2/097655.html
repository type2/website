Subject: Re: [T2] Using Kads in place of stock Solexes

Yes the scat kit doesn't mention that you have to take the ball swivel off
the carb. I just ground them off and used the supplied pieces that came with
mine. It really wasn't that difficult. Ronnie, someone told me the Kads bolt
right up to the old solex dual factory manifolds? Is this possible??

&gt;
&gt;   I just completed a Kadron carb to 2 litre type 4 engine conversion. I
had
&gt; to modify the linkage center pivot mount (SCATS) and make my own linkage
arm
&gt; pieces for on the carbs. Once I got it all set up and synced, it runs
&gt; awesome. Cost way to much money to do using new parts, but if you have all
&gt; used stuff the biggest expense will be on the intake manifolds and the
&gt; linkage, approx. 125.00 to 150.00 dolars.
&gt;
&gt;   EMPI is still working on a type4 kit and hopefully will be available
soon.
