Subject: 74 westy interior question

I have a 74 westy w/ blue and green plaid interior.  Full width rear zbed.  It does not appear to have ever been equipped with a propane tank under the vehicle.  It also appears to be a plain icebox, not a frig.  Also, there is a compartment above the icebox and some literature I've seen shows some sort of stove there.  Am I supposed to have something else?
