Subject: 210mm vs 215mm clutch

Can a 215mm clutch fit on a flywheel that it setup for a 210mm clutch?

A friend told me it works, but I'm highly skeptical. I know there are 
different part numbers for
each flywheel. Does anyone have any experience doing (or trying) this?

I have clutches and flywheels of all sizes that ever came in a bus. I 
pulled a 210mm clutch
off the 2.0L engine I'm working on. It would be nice to just bolt on a 
215mm clutch and would
save me having to get a 215mm flywheel resurfaced.

This engine is a 2.0L. I have no driving experience with a 210mm on a 
2.0. Seems kinda wimpy
for a 2.0. Would it be worth it to go to the 215mm clutch? I'd love to 
go to 228mm but I don't have any
starters or bellhousings bellhousing around (everyone keeps taking them 
from me :P ). I remember switching
the flywheel and clutch from 210mm to 215mm on my 1.7 and it was a 
pleasant upgrade.


thanks
