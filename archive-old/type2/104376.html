Subject: Fuel Sender For 72 Bus

I recently had to replace the fuel sender in my 72 bus.  Unfortunately,
I wasn't able to find a column sender.  So after weeks of looking, a
local distributor helped me out with an alternative.  And it works.  So
I thought I would pass it along.  I used a standard beetle fuel sender,
part # 113919049D.  Just wanted to share the news.  I also used POR-15
to clean my tank out and it works great.
