&gt; &lt;&lt; Another option, I'm thinking of having supports welded from the frame to

&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts on this? &gt;&gt;

&gt; Darrin,
&gt;
&gt; Be VERY careful about using a universal bug/ghia towbar that has been
&gt; &quot;adapted&quot; in any way to tow a bus.
&gt;
&gt; The beetle/ghia towbar was designed to tow an 1800 lb car with some built in
&gt; &quot;safety&quot; margin.
&gt;
&gt; Be certain you have somehow determined that your 3300 lb westfalia is within
&gt; that &quot;safety&quot; margin before you pull it anywhere!!

Darrin, Mark:
I've toward cars from the east coast to Iowa, Memphis to Iowa, from Iowa to
California, and countless times locally. It's surprising how LOW the loads are on
tow bars and their fastenings. Steering loads (laterals) are usually in the
nature of less than 100 lbs. The fore and aft loads are a little higher but still
not that high. A panic stop would generate the highest numbers, and careful
design that loaded the members purely in compression would make the most sense
here.
In addition, by most state laws, both vehicles have to be tied together with a
safety chain. The 3/8 chain I use is rated at something like 20,000 lbs breaking
strength.
(I could be off by 50% here, but it's a huge number compared to the forces
involved.)
Last year, I rescued my 56 pickup in a hurry, and rigged a homemade towbar from
only 1-1/4&quot; EMT (thin wall electrical conduit) and my safety chain and a few
bolts.
(ran the chain through one piece of EMT about 4', looped around the hitch ball
and through the second 4' piece of EMT, bolted the ends of the chain around the
lower beam out near the frame rails, put a 3&quot; bolt through the chain loop and
cinched it tight.)
This was not an unqualified success, as my attachment points had quite a bit of
slack in them and the towed vehicle was back there hunting around about a foot
back and forth. This was no big deal, cause I only had 6 or 7 miles to go, so I
never went over about 30 mph or so and just lived with it. (I was towing with the
diesel Vanagon, so 50 mph would have been tops anyway!) I feel this is definitely
a workable solution and I'd just need to use smaller chain or maybe some
fabricated connectors to get the attachments tight.
The car we towed home from the east coast was a TD Quantum (parts car, but
beautiful engine), maybe 2300 lbs, clearly not as much as a late bus or Vanagon.
We used a universal tow bar  for that. It uses only two 7/16&quot; bolts to fasten to
the bumper face bar. I would use a similar bar to tow a 68-72 bus and simply take
off the front bumper and bolt this bar to the bumper brackets. A 73 and newer bus
or Vanagon might take a little more engineering because the bumper face bar is
only held on with 4 M6 bolts and both bolts on each side  wouldn't fit directly
on the tow bar base. One M6 bolt on each side is clearly NOT enough.
YMMV
