Subject: Re: [T2] Top Ten Things I LOVE about drivng my VW

The horror I put my first-time passengers through when
I stop REALLY close to the car in front of me at a
stop light when the passenger is used to having an
engine in the front. heh heh

The feeling of being at home when the wind whistles
through the screens in my louvered windows. 

The authentic VW scent. 

Moving my entire dorm room in one trip.

Envious stares from the owners of those American POS's

&gt; &gt; 9. Jealous stares from people trapped in their
&gt; SUV's
&gt; &gt; at stoplights
&gt; &gt; 8. The purr of a finely tuned air-cooled engine
&gt; &gt; 7. AIRS
&gt; &gt; 6. Waves from other VW owner's on the road
&gt; &gt; 5. Not having to pay for a motel room
&gt; &gt; 4. Ability to do my own repairs - even if it is on
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; side of the road in the rain
&gt; &gt; 3. Sitting high over the road
&gt; &gt; 2. Going slow - It is ok to slow don now and then
