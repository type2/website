Hi Jack,

We just take carb cleaner and spray out the wire windings on the
armature. Have to be careful with this as it's highly flammable and
you want to be sure it is dried out before reassembly and powering up
the starter.

This practice is especially useful where a leaking main seal has
sprayed motor oil into the starter.
