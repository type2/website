Subject: re: turbo your heater

--This would work but ABS doesnt transefer (i.e.)
lose heat as quickly which is one advantage....
----------
1. I think probably the best material for the new
heater tube section 
is probably aluminum HVAC duct.  
----
Excellent idea!
--------------------------
2. For the fan mount, the rubber couplers designed for
connecting two 
pieces of iron drain pipe found in the plumbing
section of your local 
hardware / home improvement store.  If you make the
tolerances tight 
enough, you shouldn't have to expose very much (or
any) of the rubber 
to the hot air.  The rubber couplers are nice because
they're easy to 
work with, and can serve to dampen vibration.

As I have been &quot;skooled&quot; on this recently. ;-)
No, not all campers have a belly pan as I thought..
just the ones with the gas heaters.. the belly pan is
not very large.. I cant say as I dont have one in
front of me.. but if you dont have a gas heater than I
guess your camper doesnt have one.... I ASSumed!;-)

3. I don't think all campers have belly pans (do you
mean &quot;the length 
of the Bus&quot;?).
