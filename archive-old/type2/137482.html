But when I got over there, the porsche FI system did not have the same

I believe the '72 Porshe 914 came with a the Bosch D-Jet fuel injection 
which was also used in the VW Type 3.  This is a different animal than 
the L-Jet injection in that it uses a manifold vacuum signal to compute 
fuel flow rate.

It might work in the bus, but you would have to get all of the 
components and may be a bit more challenging to maintain since parts 
(i.e. manifold vacuum sensor) might be harder to obtain than L-jet.
