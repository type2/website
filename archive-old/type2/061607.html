&gt;This area (WV) is gaining in popularity, but is not yet so commercialized.
&gt;Access is good from four lane highways in all directions.  Guess I'm
&gt;prejudiced since I grew up in the area.   Since I still have relatives in
&gt;the area, I can try to find more information if there is an interest.

Oh BS, we are already overrun with 4-Runner, Pathfinder, driving mountain
bike riding yuppy scum from the metro DC region.  Big generalities there and
anyone driving arcane VW vans is not included.  It's what we get when
Republican AND Democrat leadership for 20 years feels, tourism (again
defined as the willfull prostitution or rape of your natural resources)
should be a states largest &quot;industry.&quot;

However, indeed we have beautiful country.  As it's been two years since the
Seneca, Dolly Sods expedition, I'm up for WV again as I'm already here and
will gladly help coordinate anywhere in the state.  I've romped all over the
eastern side pretty heavily my entire adult life.  Cass scenic railroad and
Greenbank also neat to see, and there are National Forest and WV State Park
campgrounds all over, most quite reasonable and clean.

I'm actually inclined for a couple rougher days on Dolly Sods in tents out
of the vans as a group, though I miss the time not 10 years ago when you
could go up there into a &quot;wilderness&quot; area and maybe only see another soul
every other day.

Anyway since I've missed all the East Coast stuff this year by defaults of
timing, no time like the present to plan next spring.  I'd say southern VA
on the upper Blue Ridge isn't to be ruled out either though?
