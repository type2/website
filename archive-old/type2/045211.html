Subject: [T2]  Backup lights

Hallo all!
I have a problem withmy '71 bus; the back-up lights do not work. I have
checked all the obvioud solutions---fuse, ground, etc. and can't figure it
out. Does someone have a good wiring diagraham?   Also, on the 3 '71s  I
have looked at, there is a wire  near the left taillight that ends suddenly
eithout going anwhere. What is this wire?\
