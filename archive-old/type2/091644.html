&gt; We might be talking about two different things.  I think you're
referring 
to roller rocker arms.  Those are part of it, but I also want hydraulic 
roller lifters, i.e. like regular hydraulics but with a little wheel on
the 
end that rolls over the cam lobe.  With these, you can run cams with
much 
steeper ramp rates and higher lift and not worry about wear.  To run
roller 
lifters though, you have to have a mechanism to prevent the lifters from

rotating in the bore.
