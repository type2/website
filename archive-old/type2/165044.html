Subject: Re: [T2] re:tell us about YOUR heat

&lt;&lt;My new '69 has the heater boxes disconnected from the heat ducts that
run to the front. The bellows are missing that connect the heater box to
the tube that runs front to back. I was wondering if I could just use
some paper tubing to connect these.anyone know if this would work, or
why it wouldn't work? I don't understand what those bellows are supposed
to do.&gt;&gt;

Real simple Kevin,
The bellows connect the heat exchanger's to the heater tube.

I'd give the paper tubing a shot.

Keep an eye on the back end of your Bus in the rear view mirror.

When you see smoke billowing out the back end on the fly--you'll know
why the heavy rubber bellows were used instead of paper tubing.
This'll asnwer your question pretty quick.

Carry a fire extinguisher to put the fire out under your Bus.-  ~ 8 )-
