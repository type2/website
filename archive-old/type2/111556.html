Subject: Bad Day now left in question.,..

Well just last week i adjusted the valves and also changed push rod seals....
when doing so i noticed that the drivers side head was much blacker inside than the passenger side and also the retainer wire was broken.. maybe someof you remember the post?

well she was running really really good past coup,e of days got the oil to stop leaking and also had her adjusted out just right..

we decided to go and see some friends in charleston which is like 3 and half hours from here...

well we made it 73 miles from home which was about a little over a hour or right at that..

the bus bucked a couple of times and then lost power and came back but not strong and then died as i pulled to the side of the road...
looking back in the mirror there was a thin cloud of smoke behind me..

when stopping i jumped out and seen first if there was a fire...always worried about the fire..

i seen nothing..
i smelt a kinda metal wire burnt burning smell...

wasnt strong but was there in the engine compartment...
so i thought hmmm...
pulled the valve covers and checked the pushrods and condition of rocker arms and such...

well all rods wer ok and then i started to check the gaps on the valves.,..
# three rocker arm was stuck and there was ringed smoke like out the end of a shot gun comeing from the front push rod tube on #3 .//./
wasnt a good sign...at all and then the fear started to settle in that we werent driving home no matter if i had almost every part known to man in the bus with me to fix almost anything i knew at that momment i wasnt fixing anything...
i called snoopy from the airs list and he told me to try to run it on three cylinders   very wise on his part and so i tried and had to call him back with the bad news that Grace would be piggy backing back home..

well thing is now...

i have to do a top end rebuild now..
what parts am i going to need or can that even be answered.,..?

lets say if i get someone to rebuild it top end for me what should i need to buy so that they can get the job done?

rings?pistons?etc.//.etc...?

what does it really sounds like happened to my baby bus  ?

thanks alot 
peace
