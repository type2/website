Subject: Alternator/voltage regulator problems, Need help!
Date: Fri, 01 Jun 2001 10:08:17 -0500
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Can't access the Type 2 website (It's not me) today so can't check out
the library.  Can you help me?  I have a 73 Bus that has a charging
problem.  I didn't think that with alternators that there were
separate voltage regulators, I thought they were all built together. 
After looking at the Busboy website I see that there are separate
voltage regulators.  Does a 73 have a separate regulator and if so
where would it be located at?  My problem is that my dash (GEN) light
has been on dimly for the past several days.  If the engine is just
idling it doesn't come on but when I go down the road the light comes
on.  Also if I'm driving and I stop the light will go out until I
start going again.  Does this sound like an alternator problem or
what?  Today when I stopped at a stop light the engine died and I
could not start it again until I jump started it.  Then it ran okay
for the short distance I drove it. I shut it off and then tried to
restart it and it started right up.  The dash (GEN) light is still
coming on of course.

Thanks for any advice.  I'd like to get this fixed today if at all
possible but don't want to start buying the wrong parts.

Kevin
