&gt;In this picture, does anyone know what the white cuffs at the end of the
&gt;heat exchanger control boxes are called?  They looks like asbestos or
&gt;something.  I'd like to replace them.

That is because they are, dealt with many times, get the red or black
silicone rubber grommets from a junkyard Vanagon.  The vanagon has
one straight and one bent one, you need two straight ones so find two
vanagons.  Last forever and seal a whole pile better than the asbestos
did to boot.  Of course maybe you should pay someone $1000 to come
remove that highly friable asbestos for you so you don't go and die....

&gt;
&gt;In this one, I'm trying to clean the front of the case.  Is this magnesium
&gt;because it's not responding to Aluminum polish?  What will clean this up?

Cooling housings on most T4's are indeed magnesium/aluminum similar
to T1 cases, tranny cases, etc.  Some are aluminum (914?)  To clean em
up, glass bead blast is what I normally do, cleans em to a nice matte finish
that will just corrode again of course.  So then I usually paint em with PPG
DP40/90 whateve color I got at hand.  They no longer look stock but they
sure don't corrode.  It is a real fine idea to take em apart and pressure wash
the inside BTW as it will be full of years of leaked oil mixed with dust that
will be limiting cooling air flow.  But it is a PITA to get em apart,
especially
as the steel hardware corrodes terribly into the alloy casting just like it
does
on T1 blocks and trannies.  Judicious use of engine degreaser or better yet
&quot;no fume&quot; easy off oven cleaner (APPLIED FOR SHORT PERIODS ONLY
AND NOT ALLOWED TO DRY) then spraying with the carwash pressure
washer will get a lot out without taking it apart.  The &quot;no fume blue lid&quot;
oven
cleaner is also great to scrub down the outside, but will discolor aluminum
and aluminum/magnesium if left on to long or allowed to dry.  Got to have
all the grease off to sandblast though.  I'd also bet a commerical pressure
wash cabinet like most places use for aluminum heads, tranny cases, etc
now days since cold dipping is NLA would probably make one sparkly clean,
my local place charges $20 for a set of T4 heads or for a T4 case so I bet
they would do the fan shroud for $10 or $15.  Would still need to paint it if
you don't want it corroding again.  Sometimes it pays to pay, I bet I blow
2 hours cleaning one of those things where handing a guy $15 would be a
lot smarter.
