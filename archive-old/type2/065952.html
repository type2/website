I keep tellin y'all!
Without going into my typical multi-paragragh diatribe let me simply note
that the '67 Westy Resto from Hell spent 21 months and $5,100.00 at &quot;Camp
Dietzler.&quot; As I check around, I got off rather &quot;modestly&quot; compared to some
other projects. The pace of the laborer was horrendously slow as well as
being a psychological piece of work, but he did do a very nice job.

BTW: &lt;price includes inside, outside, and underside of the completely
stripped shell, bumpers, six wheels (in case one or more ended up bent at
mounting time)
and reworking of the poptop.&gt; Some rust repair and minor pulling of the
front end from a previous (hidden) front impact. I am finally getting over
the &quot;bitter&quot; stage &lt;re: the financials&gt; as the bus comes together! The bus
is turning out really nicely! =)
