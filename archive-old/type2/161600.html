Subject: Kooleraire

Since I've had so many e-mails regarding the issue, I found these customer 
comments on a competitors' website of Kooleraire:

http://www.swampy_dot_net/kooleraire.html

Looks like the airflow is too restriced in a cooler-top style fan system, 
where it seems like that's not a problem with the mounted fan/copper tubing.

I still like the copper tubing around the fan and aquarium pump best. We had 
a system somewhat like that last summer in our 90 year-old apartment when 
the heat was over 110 inside. Wet washcloths, with sandwich-bags of ice, 
behind the fan. It knocked about 15 to 20 degrees off (along with 
sunblockers up in the windows, blocking the direct afternoon sun).

Either way - I'll choose to camp near a lake or river, or someplace where we 
can hook a sprinkler up to run through. If the drive is that hot on the way 
there, I should be driving the bus at night.

HTH -
Stephanie
