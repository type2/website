&gt; To make a very long story short... I like to run my old vehicles every few
&gt; months, get the motors warm, move them a little so they're not sitting on
&gt; the same spot on the tires and to remind the mice that these are not put
&gt; here for them to use as mobile homes.  So I went out back to my storage shed
&gt; to start the bus (it's below 30F today - I know, not that cold) - it turned
&gt; over with ease and started right up - &quot;Happy Dance&quot;.  So, it turns out that
&gt; the old battery was the main problem.

You need to disconnect the battery when it's not in use for that long. I
would keep the battery inside the garage and put a charger on it the night
before you want to put it back in your bus.
