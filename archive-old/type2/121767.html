&gt; You could probably use a relay other than the one specified (I think a

My '76 appears to have one of these Ford parts (I posted about it 
recently, asking for help identifying the part :-)  A few people 
suggested that I replace the Ford part with the Bosch relay, as the 
Ford part draws about as much current as the VW's starter solenoid does 
(i.e. &quot;err, so, what's the point?&quot;).

The Bosch relay kit is only like $8, or so, and includes the wiring 
harness and fuse.
