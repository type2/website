Subject: Re: [T2] bug battery~apology

FWIW it was designed that way, and getting an off-list copy has 
historically been considered a feature (on this list and its antecedent, 
not on every list, especially not on lists and ngs devoted to geekish 
pursuits, where off-list replies are generally considered to be deeply 
evil).

The reason is because of the traffic; v_at_l (the antecedent) could spawn 
three 100K digests a day sometimes. This list can generate over 90 
messages on a active day and there is a good chance of you missing a 
reply if it's only posted to the list. With a mainly non-technical 
audience, if it comes to your inbox as well as the list you're more 
likely to catch it.

This has no bus content...

&gt; seems to send a duplicate e-mail to the list AND the sender (any time
&gt; people reply to me, i get two copies of it), but mine only goes to the
&gt; sender.
