Subject: Re: [T2] Westy/Camper flooring questions

After seeing a EV MV Weekender, I'll be doing some seaing rearrangment on our '78 Westy. Out comes the stove/sink combo (stored in the barn) and in goes a psuedo Weekender setup. 

Still plenty of space for cargo between the seats, can carry the family and then some and we can still camp (sleep/eat). 

Don't need the sink, don't want the stove inside the bus. 

We'll go with carpet as the wood floor is pretty slippery and subject to scratching by anything put on it. 

Chris
