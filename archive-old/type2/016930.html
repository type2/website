Gotta jump in on this one guys...been there, done that.....I drove the
rockies in 85 when I moved to Vancouver for a short time from Ontario....71
bus had a rebuilt 1600 engine, mild cam, deep sump &amp; single quiet....ran
like a top thanks very much...did the speed limit &amp; then some all the
way...&amp; the bus had everything I owned in it including a spare engine in a
crate &amp; my dog.....was a great trip til I went to park in Burnaby, and the
steering knuckle sheered off the front axle....

OK, I had to go to third a few times, but I passed a bunch of trucks in the
process &amp; waved a lot...sometimes employed the famous Trudeau salute on
occasion &lt;GRIN&gt;.

Lay back &amp; enjoy the trip...just be sure the brakes are in good shape...and
the tires too.

Den.

&gt; I didn't like the decaf either... so i saved everyone a bit of tactless
&gt; grief and went back to *real* coffee.
&gt;
&gt;  You cannot possibly expect a bus to take the Canadian Rockies at a
&gt; minimum of 50-60.
&gt;
&gt; ...unless you plan on spending a lot of money and time to get it in that
&gt; shape. You want unerring reliability, power, etc... right? The easier
&gt; option is to go with an engine swap to something a little more
&gt; bulletproof, like a watercooled setup... pushrod Subaru, TDI, et.al.. A
&gt; net-search for Kennedy Engineered Products will yield some info on how
&gt; to get in touch with them. Get a catalog and peruse it for the best swap
&gt; for your bus. Keep in mind that you will probably have to beef up the
&gt; tranny to handle the increased power of the engine... Search the
&gt; Archives for juicy bits on what to do/not to do.
&gt;
&gt;  Either learn to deal with the consternation of your fellow travelers
&gt;  in a serene way, or get something stronger, because as things sit a bus
&gt; is not for you.
&gt;
&gt; Pshaw... keep the bus, accept it for what it can do... give in to it.
&gt; Let it gently subjugate you and assuage your innermost insecurities.
&gt; Drive it hard and fix whatever breaks. Admire the curves of your bus by
&gt; moonlight &lt;shiver&gt;... See it's reflection (and yours) in shop-windows as
&gt; you drive around &lt;careful...&gt;.
&gt; Besides... in the nicest possible way, (and I *do* have a soft spot for
&gt; Fords) I don't think you'd like the Ford List(s?) as much :)
&gt;
&gt; oh, geez. Look at the time... the drawback to sticking with real coffee.
&gt; It keeps me awake too long.
