Subject: Re: [T2] Great North American Extreme Bus Race

Yeah, but think of how much fun it would be.  Priceless!  The Craigslist people wouldn't have a clue.   Seriously, I got a call from a writer for HotVW today wanting to do a story on it.  I hated to tell him that it was a joke.   But if we could find the right sponsorship to make it worthwhile, VWOA, BusDepot, BustedBus (no, you guys aren't off the hook, either), German Supply, Koni, KYB, etc. etc., we might could find $20,000 or so to make it worth it.  It would certainly attract a lot of media attention.  But I think I'll just hold down the fort here at Command Central in Chattanooga.  I'm too old for that kind of stuff.  And I don't see the sponsors lining up yet.  But I'm open.  Send those checks....KR

Now all I need is an air cooled bus... lets see... Key West to 
Fairbanks, Alaska.
Rand McNally TripMaker 1997 edition says that's 91 hrs &amp; 32 min of 
driving, 5279 miles.

5300 miles / 20mpg = 265 gallons of gas _at_ $3ea = $795 gas money, $500 
entry fee. Plus chips &amp; coffee money.

Let's take a look and see what craigslist has in my area for ac buses .
