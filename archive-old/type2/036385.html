&gt; Anyone tried the new Black Cat heaters from Coleman?

Hi Steven,

After our first camping trip in the winter, we saw one of these at Wal-Mart
and bought one. We have used it many times now, and it does a very good job.
For ventilation, we open the door vents, which I figure is good for about 24
square inches. At first we also opened the side window about an inch, but we
quit because the door thing seemed to be OK. We do not have a CO monitor in
the Vanagon, but we do have one at home, so maybe next time we camp at a
place with elect we will check it out.

As far as actual heating goes, it will maintain about a 20 degree temp
differential with the top down. It does seem to do better with the top up,
bed unfolded, and mattress pulled forward to seal off the top.

The gas bottles can be expensive if you buy them individually. We get them
at Sams for about $11.00 for a case of six. Much better than $3.00 they get
at Wal-Mart. A bottle lasts overnight, or about 8 hours.

Happy Camping,
