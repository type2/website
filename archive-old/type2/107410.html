Subject: rebuilt distributors???

Do you guys have any sources for rebuilt distributors other than Bus
Depot? 

My daily driver's distributor is literally eating itself alive
apparently, and im afraid I wont even make it to the salvage yard and
back to see if they even have a bus in my year, with a motor, with a
distributor, that still works. 

Called bus depot, but they are out as is their usual supplier. 

VW part number 231-168-005

&quot;distributor with vacuum canister '76-'78 non-California model&quot; 

or, if anyone has a spare they are willing to sell me, let me know, I
can paypal you the funds instantly, or whatever other method you may
have for accepting payments.

ps - this all started with installing an electronic ignition. The
optical trigger has this plastic disk that goes over the dist shaft, and
you have to really push on the bugger to get it on there. Well, I
apparently pushed way too hard and now you can't hardly turn the thing
by hand when out of the bus. I can get it to fire up still with the
electronic ignition installed, but im missing out on a lot of
horsepower, for I have no idea what reason. 

Even thought I know the dist is shot, I thought I would try to switch
back to points and see if my horsepower came back, but it wont fire up
with points in it anymore. Probably because of all those little metal
flakes floating around in the cap now. 

*sigh*
