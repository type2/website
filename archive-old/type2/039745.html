Subject: Compression Test Data.

Hello Volks,
I did a compression test on my 83' Vanagon and found that three of the
cylinders are firing at 140-145psi and the #3 cylinder is firing at 120.
When the motor was running you could here a popping noise in the exhaust
when it fired #3 and when I was doing the compression test with all the
plugs out, I could hear a popping noise from #3.  I'm getting ready to pull
the motor to go through it and fix it up.  Any suggestions as to what to
look for that is causing the loss of compression in #3?
Thanks all.
Eggz
