Subject: Re:[T2] Anyone have a BN4 installed?

&quot;I am thinking about doing it before winter...........any one did it
and have pics??&quot;

Do you want to install it in the stock location - in the engine
compartment - or an alternative location?

I have '76 Westy that i installed a BN4 into.  I put it in the Z-Bed cabinet,
but it required cutting into the wall for the exhaust and the fuel line.  I
mounted the fuel pump under the bus.  The hot air blows out of the open
cabinet door and keeps the bus toasty in the winter.

I also have a '69 Westy with a BN4 mounted in the stock location,
but it seems difficult to try to mount it there without the duct work,
holes in the firewall, etc.

No digital camera, but maybe I could borrow one if you want pics
of either.
