The type 4 engine is a well designed beast, however it was originally
designed for a 411&amp; 914, both of which are hard to kill in stock foem, and
both of which have problems ever getting the oil hot enough to rid
contaminants..

Face it, you have a 5,000 pound bus, most cars of that weight are V8
powered..

And yes, I'm one of those guys who believes in external coolers, and also
one who shuts engines down at 235 oil temp.....Thats OK, my bus averages
185, most of the time, but it does take 7 qts to fill it up.. just wait till
it gets the dry sump, and CIS with a turbo this winter!!

Actually my Powerstroke engine ran 220 oil temp all the time without the
extrenal cooler, I added it for pulling all the weight of my trailer and
engine parts bins, and even engines..especially when climbing grades..

BTW almost every thermostat I see is not functioning correctly, and the oil
cooler is only getting 1/2 of what it should be with proper adjustment..

&gt; &gt;&gt;oil pressure above 37psi, the stock oil cooler is by-passed, and that VW
&gt; &gt;&gt;itself says that at the high end of operating temps, acceptable oil
pressure
&gt; &gt;&gt;at rpms above 2000 is only 12.5psi.
&gt;
&gt; I hope you mean &quot;below 2000 rpm&quot;.

&gt; &gt;Indeed, the Neandereers who designed the lubrication and cooling systems

&gt;
&gt; Hardly.  The stock OIL cooling system on a type 4 is marginal at best.
The
&gt; 5% grade, 100 degree air temp scenario you mention with heavy throttle for
&gt; longer than a few minutes will cause oil temps to skyrocket to unsafe
&gt; levels even in a meticulously maintaned Stock engine.  Been there, done
&gt; that.  Have to be extra stingy with the throttle under those conditions to
&gt; protect the motor, or become another statistic, broken down on the side of
&gt; the road.
&gt;
&gt; These are not Porsches or Mercedes, folks, they are VWs.  By design they
&gt; were built cheap with lots of corners cut.  Some cannot accept this, but
&gt; it's the truth!  Is the heating system overengineered?  How about
&gt; insulation?  Lots of that?  Crash protection?  Stock seats comfy?  How
&gt; about those ultra-reliable stock dual Solex carbs?  The cardboard glove
&gt; box?  The starter/ignition wiring?  Heck, how about the lack of
horsepower?
&gt; Is it really safe to pull that 5% highway grade in 2nd gear at 25mph?
&gt; Would an overengineered vehicle have these weaknesses?
&gt;
&gt; Don't get me wrong, I love my bus... but don't try and tell me that it is
&gt; the ultimate engineering marvel because it is WAY short of that.  Or maybe
&gt; I'm just missing your point.
