Subject: Fw:  Hybrid bus, Topher waring

I don't think Waring would mind this being forwarded (a little cut out) to
the list.  It arrived the same day first of the 'electric bus' posting
arrived, one of those coincidences.

I'd sent him a note asking if he'd ever considered adding some sort of hybid
power to the electric bus he rebuilds each year with his middle school
science students.  He replied...

Subject: Hybrid bus, Topher waring
...&gt;there is a school in Maine, actually on an island off the coast of
Maine, which has done a wonderful job of converting a VW bus to electric
drive. A newer bus to be sure, but you should see their work ! They have
been to the Tour de Sol twice now, so you could find them and their web site
that way.
&gt;
        I still have the orginal &quot; Helios the Heron&quot; bus, and we have put
&gt;new batteries into it. However as a high school project we are working on
&gt;making it a hybrid. How ? just as you were saying, we have built a trailer
&gt;hitch and have a trailer with a diesel generator bolted onto it which we
&gt;intend to run on biodiesel fuel. Why a trailer, so we can hitch it up to go
&gt;long distances and then disconnect it for all the local runs. More
&gt;flexibility. Also and probably more important is that the bus is going to
&gt;be used as an educational vehicle for the local primary schools, so having
&gt;all the components spread out and visible helps students see and understand
&gt;the functions better. Finally of course even good high school students have
&gt;their limit in terms how compact they can work.
