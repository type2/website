Subject: engine swap ?

&gt; Will a 1600 drop into a later (72 or 73) bus?

Yes, and I think it is a good swap.  All international busses, non US, had the
good old 1600 DP all the way through '79.  You can still buy a brand new bay
window bus in Brazil, and it will have a 1600 DP.

I took pictures of my '73 bus engine conversion and posted them here:

I hope this helps.
