&gt;I thought I would torque the lower four head bolts (nuts) since I had

&gt;(3,000 miles or so) that the #1 exhaust valve was tight, but nothing 
&gt;serious - I could still get the feeler blade in there.  All the toques 
&gt;were a *little* low, so just about every nut below the rocker arms (on 
&gt;both sides) got about a half turn.  The left sided valve cover was 
&gt;fine.

Why do you want to torque only half the head? I would agree that loose nuts are no good but otherwise, why?

If you look at the area where the the nuts go, VW used a thick washer and spot faced the contact area to ensure that the heads torque just right. On top of that, there is the recommended torque pattern.

&gt;#1 - 135
&gt;#2 - 130
&gt;#3 - 130
&gt;#4 - 125

Pretty good.

&gt;I made a trip to Sears to get a new battery.  Do I HAVE to get a group 
&gt;42?

Group 41 (large) and 42 (smaller) are just the stock sizes with the terminals reversed and are supposed fit the battery clamp.

Turn the battery around or use another size and well, you know, ymmv.
