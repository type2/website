Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Powdercoating Rims

Ask the powdercoater if the powder material
is urethane or tgic ( t-g-i-c ).
The gloss black ( bar stool ) may not be weatherable.
If you use PPG urethane liquid paint, you will not be
powdercoating those wheels.
The automated process you mention may not be
to your advantage, as wheels have thicker metal
than the other product in the production run.
That means the wheels will likely be underbaked.

&gt; here my powdercoater is a shop that make bar stool and other metal chair,
and
&gt; they powdercoat their product .
&gt;
&gt; When i bring my stuff they put it with their stuff... usually gloss black,
if
&gt; i want white (for bumpers) i must wait a few weeks because they have a
special
&gt; product for outdoor white that resist to UV, and white is less in demand.
Now
&gt; its kind of a big oven and the processs is automated.  I could ask for
&gt; specific color but then theyll do it with a small gun ...
&gt;
&gt; Maybe for the rim i think ill give a try to PPG urethane stuff as stated
&gt; before... first ill ask a few question to the technical guy responsible
for
&gt; powdercoating to try to avoid any small crevice!
