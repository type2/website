Subject: Re: [T2] gas theft

You must have taken Mike Benthin's course.  Cheers...KR
  



I am a reformed gas thief though.  Yes, it was wrong, but in High  
school a friend and I used to take gas from whatever car was parked  
next to us in the school parking lot.  The funny thing is that we  
were taking gas from all sorts of cars and putting it into a Bus!
