I'll gladly pop up for the airsucking vanagons. &lt;step up on soapbox&gt;

As far as the best year, I don't think just 1 stands out. I've had a 72 
bus, 73 westy and now  I have a 81 vanagon (Converted to camper). My 
favorite engine of all ....74 1800 cc carb.
 My 81 vanagon now has a 1800 cc type 4 engine (ala 74) w/ no smog stuff- 
Best year for heads (round port) big exhaust valves(sodium)- best year for 
exhaust. Big production year-exhaust from 72-74 fits. 1 piece muffler- no 
crossover pipes. Good for used parts such as heat exchangers (NO triangle 
ports here)&amp;(cost)- alternator w/ external voltage regulator. Also 
mechanical fuel pump and carb setup (mine is now a webber progressive)- 
cuts down on high pressure fuel fires and I get to giggle at fuel injection 
troubleshooting messages. Also, solid lifters ! (gotta love that sound) You 
can even use an .009 dizzy.

&lt;turn on hose to avoid potential flames&gt;

My favorite body style, vanagon westy setup.
 Add all the above to the aero- design of the wedge. Mine was a sunroof- 
now with a ragtop- but has full deluxe west interior- stove, fridge, plenty 
of storage -cabinet layout is great. Got a set of GL seats w/ swivels. 
Vanagon has a fan for cool air circulation- Good suspension system- ala-I 
don't have &quot;butt sag&quot;. Brake parts swap w/ earlier 73-79 type 2's.  It's 
still aircooled, big windows, lots o visibility, steering is better than 
&quot;loaf&quot;, hydraulic clutch, I like gear ratio's of tranny. Deck lid is lower, 
van is roomier. Spare tire tucked up under the van- saves space. Got westy 
springs w/out poptop weight. Retract seatbelts. Engine hatch !!- Hinge 
front tranny mount- The easiest to remove an engine from on side of the 
road.(2 jacks not 3). Fuel tank is not gravity fed like early type 2's- 
easier to extingush. It even fits in my garage ! Sits level too !!

As far as the affection goes, I was born in 1970. I grew up with punk rock 
and new wave, swatch watches, buttonfly jeans, the walkman, atari home 
computers , and the list goes on. My first bus was assembled when I was 2. 
I didn't love is less, but I love my wedge. The aircooled wedge is like a 
middle child in the family, not alot of attention. Doesn't get the 
&quot;affection&quot; that a splittie or bay gets because they are older. Or seems 
outdated by having &quot;real heat&quot; and creature comforts such as power butt 
massager or whatever. It also doesn't have the stereotype associated with 
the bus. No beads on the windows, rainbow paintjobs or dead 8 tracks in the 
glovebox.

 &quot;I do yearn to have the street cred of a type2&quot;

Only 3 years of airsucking wedge- a limited breed. There are more &quot;loaf&quot; 
type 2's than vanagon's in my city. I also do not have my wife asking me 
about the fear of death, as in my bay, when semi's would blow by as the 
wheel would turn side to side. I might as well have put a rudder on the 
back of that bus.

IMHO, the best bus to get is the cheapest, with the most spare parts in the 
back !! :]  How many of you have a &quot;bus allowance&quot; ? Your spare parts 
corner in the garage ? Repair manuals on the back of the toilet seat ? Can 
you stop at just 1 ?

Nobody can say that one year is better that the other, but mine is my 
favorite !!

&lt;step down from soapbox&gt;
can someone loan me $.02 ?
