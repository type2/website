Subject: 10mm Or is it?

Hello.... I'm still working on Folly's motor.  I have everything off 
including the rocker arm assembly and the bolts that keep the heads 
on... but I need to remove the &quot;fan&quot; on her type IV 1700 motor.  There 
are three &quot;allen&quot; key screws.  Muir says they're ten mm with 12 splines.  
I can't find a tool like that anywhere in Sudbury.  I can find an 8mm 
but no ten.  The last chAnce place was closed for the weekend today,  
Question is... are those nuts really 10mm?  I have a set of metric 
regular allen keys and the 10 mm size sure is a hell of a lot larger!

Also... I want to replace the heater controls cause Follys are so badly 
bent the little red and blue thingies won't stay on.  I stripped a set 
from the parting bus and discovered that the top end of the controls are 
kept in place by what looks to be a plastic rivit.  Is there and easy 
way to take them out so I can use them again?
