&gt; also if i need
&gt; to change the fuel lines i would like to find out some of your opinions on
&gt; where to find the best.   i want all of them from the pickup tube all the
&gt; way to the injectors.   thank you guys in advance.

We have a kit, it includes all the fuel hose in pre-cut lengths and all the
proper hose clips for the job. This has been the best selling product of
anything in our catalogue in the past year or so and I have just finished
test-installing the 1975, 1976 and 1977 kits, all of which are unique and
different from the kit for 78-79. Next month I will be making a kit for
air-cooled Vanagon and test installing it on a customer's '80.
