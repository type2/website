Jeff,
I have the info on your shipment.  My normal salesperson at RMMW's wholesale
division was on vacation, and the fill-in guy managed to make a mess of your
name and address, turning Jeff Marek into &quot;Feff Mark,&quot; and reversing some of
the digits in the zip code to boot!  Not surprisingly, UPS couldn't find
Feff Mark, and returned the package to RMMW.  RMMW apparantly did not even
know that the package had been returned to them until I told them.  In any
event, I am having them re-ship the package via expedited shipping, with
RMMW picking up the tab for the additional shipping cost.  My apologies for
the error.  My usual contact at RMMW is very reliable and would not have
gotten the address so messed up.

&gt; I didn't learn until now that the muffler had not arrived...
&gt;
&gt; In any event, I immediately put a call into RMMW to find out what
&gt; happened, and left a message on their voice mail.  Usually they
&gt; are very prompt and ship the same day.  I'm sure they'll get back
&gt; to me tomorrow and I can let you know what happened.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I've been waiting 3 weeks for my muffler....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm figuring this is one of those things that gets drop shipped from
&gt; &gt; RMMW- does it always take this long?
