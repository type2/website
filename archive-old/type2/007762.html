Subject: Westy tent poles for sale and My new top
Date: Wed, 18 Nov 1998 02:49:43 PST

Hey Y'all
  I just got a Westy pop top for my 70 Sunroof Bus. It came with a set 
of tent poles (2 poles). I don't have a tent for the bus so I don't need 
the poles. I will sell them if anyone wants them. Just make me an offer. 
I can also get a table that swings up. These are both off a 70 
Campmobile(westy).  The rest of the bus is in bad shape so no other 
parts are useable. Let me know if you want the poles or the table. Some 
of the cabinet doors are ok also.
