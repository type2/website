&gt; Hello list members. I posted a couple of weeks ago about my
&gt; lowered bus rubbing up front when I had it loaded.  My only two
&gt; option were to raise it or change wheel and tire package. I dont
&gt;  have the time or all the parts needed to raise it so I opted for the tire
&gt; swap.
&gt; So I have for sale Aset of 5 spoke polished empi`s and Goodyear Eagle Gps
&gt; 195/60r15 radials, with all hardware. The tires have 3,000 miles on them.
&gt;  They are like brand new. I want 450.00 for them or will trade for a nice
&gt; full length roof rack.
&gt; I am located in Delaware.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dave Parsons
