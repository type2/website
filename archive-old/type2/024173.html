Subject: She'll start, but she don't want to!!! :-)

First off, thanks to everyone who gave me such good advice about Air Flow
Meters...  My bus is back on the road, thanks to fellow list member Karl von
Salzen, who sold me a used AFM for a very good deal.

Now, that I have this installed, I have noticed that she is tough to start.
She just cranks and cranks, never lighting up.  Then all of a sudden, boom,
she's started!! (there is no literal BOOM...) 

How could changing the AFM cause this to happen?

It's like the engine isn't getting any gas...

any ideas?

Marcus
(Thanks again, Karl!!!).
