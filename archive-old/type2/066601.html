Subject: Ball Joint Thread Continued

I have at least one ball joint boot on my '77 westy which is torn.  I
read at least one post in the past the said the boots can't be replaced
and that the whole joint must be replaced.
Is this true?
If the whole joint needs to be replaced anyway then I suppose I might as
well drive the torn ones until they really need replacing (now the are fine)
Is there a technique to prolong the life of a ball joint with a torn boot?
Just trying to keep my bus going as long as it can,
Brett
