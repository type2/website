&lt;&lt; &gt; Jeez, if I had a flat tire I would be screwed. Or maybe the shop was made

been there done that, pouring rain at night, finally had to &quot;borrow&quot; a
piece of a farmers fence to use as a breaker bar...not fun
 &gt;&gt;

BTDT 2:
             Same weather plus NYC...Limped into a gas station to let them
play with the lug nuts. A while later the guy comes into the office to 
tell me the lug nuts are, &quot;Screwed up,&quot; and won't come off...Ace tried
to use the wrong socket and rounded off the nuts with the airgun. I
offered to trade him his life for plugging the tire on the rim on the bus
so I could at least get home and get the wheel off with my &quot;salvage&quot;
socket and a 1/2 in. breaker bar...
