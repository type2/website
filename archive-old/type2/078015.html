Subject: Re: [T2] How to take out the plastic bolt from heater control nob???

  I think I read somewhere on this list to try a small socket. I pulled the 
radio out and used a 1/4&quot; nut driver  (maybe it was 3/16&quot; ?)  and they popped 
out relatively easy without breaking. Sure was easier than the last time I 
tried it using the pliers method.....but I'm still not putting them back in!
