X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Is there a misconception that buses are not as reliable as other cars?  I
see this post all the time.  while I was trying to sell my 76 westy on ebay
I would get all these emails &quot;will it make it to ____&quot;.  My buses have never
left me stuck.  I have never had one towed.  OTOH when my 96 Grand Am's
alternator went bad I had to have it towed as all the electronic marvels
including the computer would not work.  I believe proper maintenance &amp;
knowing your vehicle will keep you out of trouble.  A little common sense
would not hurt either.  If this is a Friday topic then sorry.

&gt; &gt; Hello, this is my very first question to the list.  I am planning a trip
in
&gt; &gt; August from Cleveland Ohio to southern New York.  Will my 70 Westy make
it
&gt; &gt; without any trouble with adjustments?  It's a rebuilt motor now, I did
it two
&gt; &gt; months ago.  It sounds great,  I have never taken it out of state before
so I
&gt; &gt; was just wondering.
&gt;
&gt; I once drove my 65 Westy from Colo to MD without turning the engine off,
&gt; nonstop...I routinely drive my current 78 from MD to New England and back,
&gt; usually in winter (I ski)
