Subject: [Q] Dead Engine; Need Options

Group-

My '71 Camper's engine *died*.  A piston rod cracked in half and was driven
into the case!  So, I'm considering my options (in no particular order):

1- rebuild an engine myself
2- pay to have an engine rebuilt
3- buy a turn-key engine

(I haven't considered who, including myself, should do the installation.)

I have committed to keeping the Camper, even though it needs much work.  I
need to pick the engine I can live with for a while.  I like the idea of a
1600, but hate the performance.  I like the idea of a high-performance
engine, but hate the cost.

Perhaps a 1600 dynamically balanced and blueprinted?
Perhaps a FI longblock (aircooled), maybe dynamically balanced and
blueprinted?
Perhaps a suggestion from someone who's got a clue?

Reliability is priority #1, with performance #2.
