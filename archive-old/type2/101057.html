Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Rear Wheel Bearings?  HELP!

Jason,

Haven't done the ones on my 78 yet, but did do my 79 convertible.

Just buy new bearings and count on a day of it.
If they wiggle that much, then you are going to need to replace them 
anyway.  Cheap insurance for another 100,000+ miles.



Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been noticing a ~CLUNK~ type noise coming from the right-rear of my 
&gt; 1979 Westy when I go over bumps, and checked it out yesterday.  I pulled off 
&gt; the wheel and unbolted the brake drum, and was able to move the stub axle 
&gt; in-and-out about 1/8&quot; by hand.  That would explain the ~CLUNK~ noise!
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously, it's something to do with the bearings, but what?  Do they just 
&gt; need repacking with grease and readjusting?  Or, do I need to remove the 
&gt; entire assembly and replace the seals and bearings?  It has been doing this 
&gt; for about 3,000 miles.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe one can't adjust rear bearings the same way one can adjust the 
&gt; front.  In addition, I helped a friend with his sag correction and rear 
&gt; bearing replacement on his '71, and agree with the general consensus that 
&gt; Bentley is a pretty poor resource for this job.  Does anybody know of a 
&gt; better resource?  My friend will be helping me, but I'm sure that '71 is 
&gt; different from '79.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help or suggestions.
