&gt; Previously I had reported that the VDO-150-752 Oil pressure sender extension

&gt; http://www2.cip1_dot_com/SearchResults.asp?Search=vdo-150-752&lt;http://www2.cip1.co
&gt; m/SearchResults.asp?Search=vdo-150-752&gt;. :~)

The VDO kit I bought with the non-metric ends was this item from CIP1_dot_com.

&gt; When I receive the kit I'll Let you know if it is the VDO kit or some other
&gt; junk.

It's out of stock. Either you got the last one or you won't.
