Subject: VWoA and the bus trademark

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C212B6.9F290A50

&gt;First off, I can guarantee that VWOA's trademark creeps are going to sta=
rt
actively pursuing anyone who uses &quot;bus&quot; in their domain name, especially =
if
it is a VW oriented site. Watch out BusDepot, BustedBus, etc...  They did
the same thing when the &quot;new&quot; Beetle came out, and I fully expect them to
try to repossess the rights to anything and everything bus-related.&lt;

This slightly interests me.  A &quot;bus&quot;  does not just pertain to VW.  In fa=
ct, that word was out many years before the VW was even around.  And furt=
hermore, being a fan of all vintage busses, and not just VWs, I have seen=
 many pictures of late 40s busses that the original microbus looks just l=
ike.  In that respect, it looks like VW could have been copying these pas=
senger busses in a smaller scale.  Therefore becoming the &quot;micro&quot; bus.  A=
 big bus in small scale.  I would love to see a company like Flexible Fly=
er, come out and sue VWoA for some kind of infringement on the original b=
us shape.  Would that not be something?  VW does not, and never will own =
the &quot;bus&quot; name.  Beetle?  that is a whole different animal.  Never was a =
beetle before the beetle.  Thank God for busses before busses!Get more fr=
