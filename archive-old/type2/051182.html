Subject: [T2] Parts and pieces I need.

Don't know if I'm allowed to ask for parts on the list or not so I'll risk a
beating. :-)
I'm looking for the black pushbutton handles for my 79 Westy, a screen for
the jalousie window on the sliding door, and a few other bits and pieces.
Could people contact me off list at chook_at_nisa_dot_net if they have any
reasonably priced used stuff.
Many thanks,
Courtney
