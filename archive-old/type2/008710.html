BEGIN------------cut here-------------

This is the charter of the type2 list. Welcome to the list! You MUST READ
this document at least through the Priority One section if you want to
stay on the list.

This list is only about aircooled Volkswagen Transporters, Vanagons and
Caravelles, model years 1968 through 1983. If you have an earlier bus, or
a watercooled bus, you are on the wrong list.

To maintain this resource we use (at the time of this writing) four
different list administrators plus a server admin, a webmaster and several
other crucial volunteers. The list admins rotate with each of them working
about seven days per month. You can always get hold of the administrator
on duty by sending mail to &lt;type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com&gt;.

To post a message to the list, send it to &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;.

type2_dot_com is funded entirely by donations from list members. We do not run
advertisements or endorse vendors. You will not be charged (or expected to
hand over an obligatory donation) for any resource we provide, not ever.

This list has about a thousand people on it (yes!), and because of that we
have to have some rules. This is how we maintain the value of the list as
an information source.


_______________________________________________________________________________
PRIORITY ONE RULES -- If you screw up here you'll be kicked off the list
and quite possibly banned forever (we really mean it):


--Do not EVER post UNSUBSCRIBE messages to the list. Clear instructions
for getting off the list are printed in every single message the list
server sends out. Every single one. If for some reason you are having
trouble getting off the list, send mail to the administrator on duty at
&lt;type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com&gt;.

--Do not EVER post &quot;TEST&quot; messages to the list. Don't even think about
doing this. If you are having trouble posting, send mail to the list
administrator on duty &lt;type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com&gt; and he will help you.

--Do not EVER post virus warnings, or messages about important issues that
you think should concern everybody in the world. Do not post messages
unless they have legitimate bus content. If you think the message you're
sending is so important that the &quot;bus content&quot; rule does not apply to you,
that means that you should ==NOT== post it.

--Do not ever continue a thread that an administrator has &quot;killed&quot;. This
is fairly rare, but if an admin says &quot;please kill this thread,&quot; then kill
it. This is how they keep marginal discussions from growing out of
control.

--Do not harvest addresses. It is not appropriate to collect the personal
email addresses of list members and send them bulk email about your event
or &quot;special offer&quot;. This is called &quot;spamming&quot; and if you do it you will be
denounced throughout usenet and all the VW mailing lists, banned from our
list forever, and we will be talking to your ISP about having your service
terminated.

--Do not use an auto-responder without unsubscribing from the list first.
If your &quot;out of the office&quot; program starts trying to post messages to the
list you will be removed.


_______________________________________________________________________________
PRIORITY TWO RULES -- If you screw up here you will be quietly
&quot;moderated&quot;, which means a list administrator will intercept and examine
every message you try to post to the list. This can slow your messages by
up to 48 hours:

--Don't post chatty messages. If it does not have legitimate bus content,
do not post it to the list. There should be a good reason that 1000 people
will download your message. We do enforce the &quot;no chat&quot; rule consistently
and it is the number one reason people get moderated.

--Don't post Friday subjects except on Friday. Historically, the content
guidelines are looser on Friday, and that is the only day when it is
appropriate to post messages on certain (marginal) subjects. The Friday
subjects are:

	-- Sightings (you noticed a bus in a movie/TV show/commercial/your
	neighborhood)
	
	--Toys (VW models and toys and paraphinalia of all descriptions,
	loved by collectors but somewhat dull for everybody else)
	
	--Surveys (what is your personal opinion of thus &amp; such bus
issue?)
	Replies to surveys should always go to the author, never to the
list.
	

_______________________________________________________________________________
ETIQUETTE AND LIST CULTURE -- For some of these issues we use &quot;filters&quot; --
software which might intercept your message. For the rest we rely upon
your judgement:

--We only accept messages in 7-bit ASCII text. In many mail programs this
is called &quot;plain text&quot;. You may have to tweak your mail program to get it
to send plain text. If you try to send mail in rich text or HTML, your
message will be intercepted and returned to you. We do this because it is
the only way to assure that everybody on the list can read your mail.

--There is a mail size limit of 20,000 characters and we don't allow
attachments. Do not try to post pictures, they won't get through.

--Please quote only for context. Do not quote other people's entire
messages when replying. The list server can identify messages that are
more than 75% quoted text and return them.

--Search the archives and consult the extensive resources available to you
at www.type2_dot_com before asking on the list. You will get more information
faster that way. If you ask frequently asked questions (FAQs) or
frequently annoying recurring threads (FARTS), people will be inclined to
ignore you or become caustic.

--Vendors are welcome and encouraged to participate in the list--we've had
several vendors who have been valued list members. Specific answers to
specific queries about products and pricing are fine, but please avoid
repeatedly posting advertisements. What we're looking for here is high
information value for the listees. If we think you are merely spamming we
will moderate you very quickly.

--Occasionally, a list member will have a problem with the performance of
a vendor or with a private transaction gone bad. If you are having trouble
with a vendor, do everything you reasonably can to resolve it WITH THE
VENDOR before you bring it to the list. Do not ambush people. If you can't
resolve it yourself, it is a valid topic for discussion on the list, but
please stick to the facts of the vendor's product or performance. Flames
are not appropriate EVEN IF you can prove you've been shafted.

--Do not try to advertise your eBay auctions or other auctions on the
list. We filter heavily for this. If we want to know what is for sale on
eBay we will go there and look.

--Try to write using conventional capitalization, syntax and spelling. It
indicates respect for the reader, and intentionally ignoring these
conventions indicates contempt.


_______________________________________________________________________________
PRIVACY POLICY

We detest spammers. We will not sell or share our subscriber lists no
matter what the inducement. Our list server will not reveal the addresses
of subscribers through automated commands. Our web site does not employ
cookies. We utilize a web &quot;reflector&quot; so people can read list mail without
being subscribed to the list; the reflector obliterates your email address
before posting your mail where the world can see it.

We do log all web transactions and all mail transactions; this is done
strictly for the sake of security. We do not keep track of your browsing
habits. By subscribing to this list you have not consented to receive
&quot;promotional email&quot; or any other such rubbish. In short, we will not spy
on you, and if you have trusted us with your email address we will do our
best to see that your trust is not betrayed.


_______________________________________________________________________________
LEGAL STUFF 

1. This is not a moderated list. The administrator doesn't see the
messages until you do, maybe later than you do, and because of the nature
of this medium the administrator has no way of retracting messages from
public view. Propogation is automatic; once you send a message, it's gonna
go, and there's no way of stopping it.

2. Since that is true, the administrator cannot control what is posted to
this list, and therefore disclaims any responsibility for the messages the
list server propogates. If you post a message, you alone are responsible
for it. If you don't like that, then don't post messages.

3. This list is distributed from a server located in the USA. By United
States copyright law (and by treaty with many other countries), messages
posted to this list are copyrighted with all rights reserved by their
respective authors. The administrator of this list makes no claim to
ownership of your messages and will not republish or sell them, and
neither should anybody else.

However, cross-posting is common on the Net whether it is authorized or
not, and if you post a message to this list it will automatically be
entered into at least two publicly accessible online archives, where it
will remain permanently. If you don't like the possibility of your words
being cross-posted or archived, then don't post messages.

Erik,

On the quoting article, with four of us taking turns, the message is still
there, but I thought someone else was taking care of it.  I will forward
it around and see who is doing what.  I read it and it looks like a good
idea, tho my natural cynicism takes over at that point and i winder if
those who are most at fault will bother to read it. One thing I thought
when I started here was that since this was an e-mail list, that those who
used it would be able to read.  Experience has proved me wrong on that
again and again :-)

On sorting the list, the one constant I know of is the line:

Return-Path: &lt;type2-request_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

in the header.  That is what I sort on.  Everything else can change
depending on where the incoming came from.  Most people post to
type2_at_type2_dot_com, but some post to type2-digest_at_type2_dot_com.  they are
supposed to come out the same, but don't always.  Also, some people choose
to reply to someone and bcc: the list.  Makes it confusing :-) 

                        Administrator, type2 list
