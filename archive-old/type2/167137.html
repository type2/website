Subject: RE: [T2] is the SVDA still the best?

That's what I'm running.  I went out and bought an new distributor, (SVDA
vaccum advance) pertronix coil, pextronix electronic ignition and new wires.
I'm running a similar Weber 32/36 progressive carb.  Apparently Petronix does
not manufacture an appropriate distributor for a bus running this
system.Although, I haven't installed these components as I need to address an
'over-heating' running condition possibly caused by a timing issue using my
current distributor and points.  I'm not going to change anything until I
correct this problem.

I'll let you know how these new components run as I make progress ...
&gt; Is the general consensus still that the SVDA&gt; distributor that aircooled_dot_net
sells is the best&gt; solution in its price range for a type4 bus running a&gt;
Weber 32/36 progressive?
