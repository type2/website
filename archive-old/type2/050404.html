Roland Finston sends:

&gt; But you shouldn't wait that long. In fact many Van owners aren't aware that
&gt; preventive maintenance calls for the cv's to be examined for need of
&gt; lubrication every 30-60,000 miles. This is true even when the boots are
&gt; patent because the grease leaks out of the flange very slowly, almost
&gt; imperceptibly, and appears as a uniform scum on the outside of the
&gt; flange/joint.

*Examined* for lubrication every 30-60,000 miles? Hell with that!

Your annual service ritual (the one where you change the hypoid oil,
readjust the clutch cable 'cause you know it needs it, tighten the parking
brake cables and so on) should include pulling the CV halfshafts, tearing
down and relubing the CVs, and reinstalling the halfshafts.

This does three things for you--it makes sure you have nice clean grease in
them on a regular basis (there is a special CV grease, but Valvoline
SynPower is also good), it lets you inspect the balls--any marking on the
balls and that CV needs to go away), and it lets you get up close and
personal with the boots.

Okay, okay, it also keeps the bolts from rusting in. Important, but not the
only thing.
