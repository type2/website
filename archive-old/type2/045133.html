Subject: Re: [T2] odd bus sighting, AIRS question

Patrick,
ive seen a couple pictures of buses with the bug on
the roof posted to the internet, so if i run across
one ill email it to you.   to see a quick shot of a
really nice one, if you can find the movie Tie-Dyed,
the documentary about deadheads on tour, there is a
sweet baywindow with bug on top, complete with a sweet
flame job coming off the front and murals all around. 
 its pretty cool.   actually there are quite a few
buses throughout the film.

&gt; Being Friday and all, I though I'd ask about a bus
&gt; my father saw on
&gt; the NYS thruway a few weeks ago and told me about. 
&gt; It is a bay window
&gt; with a the top 1/2 of a bug body welded to the roof,
&gt; facing backwards.
&gt; This is the best  I can get from my father so
&gt; details could be wrong.
&gt; It was south of Albany but north of NYC, I'd  guess
&gt; closer to Albany.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody confirm that my father isn't crazy, and know
&gt; whose bus this
&gt; is? I'd love to see a picture.
&gt; 
&gt; On an different note, I wonder if there is a way to
&gt; link up the
&gt; westfalia_dot_org roll call that others have mentioned
&gt; that list folks who
&gt; are willing to provide travelers with various
&gt; services, with AIRS.
&gt; They offer similar services and folks should be
&gt; aware of both.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope y'all have a trouble free trip to and from
&gt; BBTA. Should be huge
&gt; this year.  Bring your electric fans if you have
&gt; electric hookup.
&gt; Last year there was electric hookup, and it will be
&gt; a hot weekend!
