Subject: Re: [T2] What's the deal with all the cheap busses FS recently?

Traditionally in New England cheap vehicles usually go up for sale at 2 times
during the year. At the end of the camping season, before the snow hits, and
starting when the weather starts to turn. The http://www.thewantad_dot_com is
pretty thin in the used car sections, but there is alot of snowmobiles for sale
:D 

Here's a couple of examples from MA. (my comments in parentheses):

78 VW Vanagon (yep, that's what the ad says). Std. GD Int. glass and trans. New
clutch. Alot of chrome. (champagne edition??) Have Title. $250 takes it away.
Call after 3pm. Brockton 508-857-2945

Sounds like a decent parts bus, but because of the price it's probably a rust
bucket with a blown engine. 

Here another one that is more in tune with what I'd buy:

76 VW CAMPER. From TX. Westfalia pop-up. Auto. No rust. New paint and top. Bed,
stove, table, etc. (so it's a deluxe - chrome yellow??) Starts and runs good.
$2950; Call Eric. Medway cell 617-212-9929

Sounds like a decent deal to me unless the new paint is a non stock color
and/or hiding some prior body damage.

You make your choices, and take your chances.
