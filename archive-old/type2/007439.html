Hey Now!
Just got back from driving my 79 Riviera from Portland OR down to the tip
of Mexico's Baja California and back (4700 miles) and it's good to be
dialed back onto the list.  I missed having such a valuable resource at
arm's length the whole way down, and felt somewhat vulnerable without the
input of everybody.  However, the very few glitches I experienced were
quickly dealt with using my memory of everyone's list wisdom.  So, thank
you!  Just wanted to add that if there's any bussers out there who are
thinking of such a trip and want any related information (or a trip
report), just ask.  If you're contemplating something of this sort, I can
assure you of one thing:  Do It!  This is some of the most beautiful and
unusual country you can imagine, and it's even better in a bus.  Picture
being parked on a beach 10 feet from the Sea of Cortez next to a palapa
drinking a Pacifico...  Cheers!  (p.s. You wouldn't believe how many busses
there are down there.)
