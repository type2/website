&gt; So 3 busers walk into a VWFLAPS; a barndoor owner, a splittie owner, and
&gt; a 'loafer.  They walk up to the counter and the loafer says:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;I want to get a price on the complete exhaust system for a 79 bus&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; The parts man falls to the floor laughing, incidentally hitting his head
&gt; hard on the counter.  The fellow employee dials 911, but it was too late.

And the other parts guy turns to the bussers and sez, &quot;You know, this
is the lamest joke I've ever been in.&quot;
