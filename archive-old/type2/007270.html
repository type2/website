I have a 1979 type 2 camper bus that I've owned for 3 months.  It's previous owner told me he put a new engine in late December 1990.  It's number is AS182290X.  I've been getting around to doing various maintainence on the bus and was going to check the valve clearences.  John Muir's book tells me that '78 on, buses have non-adjustable hydraulic valves.  How can I tell if this is the case with my engine?  If they are hydraulic valves, does that mean I leave them alone compleatly, or is there any maintainence at all?  Keep posting guys and gals, this listing is a bus saver!
