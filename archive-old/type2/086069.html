Subject: RE: [T2] Crooked Sump Tube in New case

  Thats just the way the new Brazil-Brazil cases come, I have one of those
in my 60 bus built to an 1800 and haven't had any problems. The Brazil-
Mexico case does not have this problem (or is it). The only thing, is you
can not put a deep sump on it. One of the good points of the BB case is it
still has the groove for the old style cam plug.

Germany)

Subject: [T2] Crooked Sump Tube in New case


Just got a new Brazilian universal case and noticed that the sump tube is
not quite verticle.  Has anyone experienced a problem with this such
as getting the oil screen on or anything else that might pop up later.  I 
thought of replacing it with my old tube but it's a bugger to get out.
Thanks,
Greg
