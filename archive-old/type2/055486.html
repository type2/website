Subject: Cold Start Valve Malfunction Question...
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hey list-

I came across a really bizarre problem, with an even wierder cause, and wonder
if anyone has had this happen...

I was experiencing shakes and shimmies, the likes of which made me think my
AFM was on the fritz.  Replaced it, problem vanashed for a month and came
back.  Like someone was flipping a switch or something... (77 westy)

Readjusted the board in the new AFM, but problem remained.  Tried new fuel
filter, still the violent bam bam of before...

Then it hit me on my way home this morning.   My fuel economy dropped to about
13 MPG.  Car ran hot, and smelled raw fuel when the &quot;bam bam&quot; happened thru
the heater (Another problem on my list). What's causing the flooding?? This
seems wierd.

I remember having a problem about 6 months ago where the #3 cyl head temp
sensor wire came loose, and triggered the ColdStart Valve to operate, flooding
and shutting the motor down.  (replaced sensor).  I unplugged the CSV, and
Viola, no more problem. (Other than the shaking loosening up my fan and sheet
metal - if this happens to you, check all your bolts!!) So the problem is
solved, but I have no CSV now.

My question- What would cause the CSV to operate at the wrong time,
sporadically, other than the #3 temp. sensor?  Is this a sign my black box is
going?  Can they be rebuilt, or do they have to be replaced?  Is there a
checkout procedure for the black box to see if mine's OK or shot?  

TIA, Tom
