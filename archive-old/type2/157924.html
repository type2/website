Subject: [T2] Re: Sound deadening...

Matthew Brooke sez [...many useful things about acoustic insulation...]:

&gt; Same thing applies to the engine bay -
&gt; add *absorptive* material (e.g. fiberglass)
&gt; inside the engine bay, to soak up the
&gt; sound at source, and add *mass* to the
&gt; metal between the engine and interior,
&gt; to stop noise getting through.

I wonder if there's a difference in insulating for reflected noise (like in a concert hall) and insulating for transmitted noise (like in a vehicle).

In a marine diesel installation (insanely loud diesel with no damper) they commonly use pink construction foam encased on both sides with sheets of lead. The lead can be very thin but it needs to be there. I don't know if this is the most effective thing but I'm told it is the most bang for the buck. Hey I made a pun, did you see what I did there?
