Subject: Re: [T2] Need source for charcoal filter hoses

Hi Bill -

There are two short hoses in the compartment for the breather utilized on
68-71 Type 2s:

N 020 357 1  7mm ID x 82.5mm long (3.25&quot;) - Hose connects from Fuel Tank to
Metal Breather Tube. (You could substitute 1/4&quot; ID Fuel Hose for this).

N 020 359 1  9mm ID x 127mm long (5&quot;) - Hose connects from 1 section of
breather tube to another section. (You could substitute 5/16&quot; ID Fuel Hose
for this).

And that's it.

The tall vent tubing setup is in 72-later Type 2s

&gt;  Thanks Jim,
&gt;
&gt; I'm also going to have the fuel tank compartment open and want to replace
&gt; the hoses in there. I don't have the tall vent tubing in the side air
&gt; intakes. As I recall, there is just some plumbing inside the fuel tank
&gt; compartment that makes its way out to the canister. Do you know what the
&gt; size or part number is for the hoses inside the fuel tank compartment?
&gt;

&gt; The correct hose to use is 12mm ID Breather Hose, fuel and oil resistant.
&gt; VW Part Number N 020 374 1, many vendors on the list carry it.  In a quick
&gt; fix, 1/2&quot; PCV Hose is acceptable to use as it's oil and fuel resistant and
&gt; can be found at any FLAPS.

&gt; &gt; Listee's,
&gt; &gt; It's time to replace the charcoal filter hoses on my 71. The charcoal
&gt; &gt; filter has one hose going to the right side of the fan shroud, one to the
&gt; &gt; oil bath air filter and one coming thru the firewall from the gas tank.
&gt; &gt; (there is also another hose from the oil filler to the air filter). It looks
&gt; &gt; like they are all the same size. The tube on the side of the fan shroud that
&gt; &gt; the hose slips over measures .508 in. or about 13mm. What is a source for a
&gt; &gt; good quality hose for this application? - especially the hose from the gas
&gt; &gt; tank which has to tolerate raw gas fumes.
&gt; &gt; Sincere Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Bill Moon
