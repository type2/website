&gt;I just recieved an order I placed with SIR...

Confirming, Hoover is right about the rods. They're to the thousandth and
they're flat in the bore (&quot;rebuilt&quot; rods from my FLAPS make for
wedge-shaped Plastigauge).

But, what is the correct phone number? I have it as 800-331-4775 but
somebody else said that's not right.
