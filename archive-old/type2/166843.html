Subject: oil temp readings

Hey all
Happy Friday!!!
I was looking around for some data on Oil temp readings, I recently
rebuilt a 80 westy 2.0 air-cooled and put in the VDO sump plate temp
sensor and 300 degree gauge
What is Normal operating temp, what is the high end shut down now temp.
any body have a link to some of this kind of data?

Thanks
