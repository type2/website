&gt; I have confidence that I can build an engine and get it running
&gt; smoothly. But without measuring the case, having it align bored if
&gt; needed, and having the rotating mass balanced, I know that it will
&gt; probably be a 40,000 mile engine. Maybe as much as 60,000. Maybe as
&gt; little as 20,000.

I'm not sure I entirely agree here.

The TypeIV cases are now old enough in general that having the case checked
and align bored if needed makes a lot of sense if one wants an engine with a
long life.

Having the rotating mass balanced will certainly contribute to engine
smoothness and longevity, but I don't see why *not* having this done would
condem you to only getting 40,000 miles from the engine.  After all, VW
certainly didn't do a dynamic balance of these engines when they were
building them back in the '70's and 80's, but folks routinely got lots more
miles than that on their new vehicles.

It's the heads that tend to be the weak spot on these engines and failures
here are what typically result in a &quot;short milage&quot; failure.
