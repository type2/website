Subject: MAX out your Propane Capacity / Do propane tanks HAVE to be Cylindrical?

I am toying with the idea of a dual fuel setup (there is a 
guy in the UK that has kits for air cooled vans). But to 
make this worthwhile at all I need more propane capacity, 
well beyond just adding a second standard sized westy tank 
under the sliding door (No I dont want to put the tank 
inside the van, nor do I want a larger or second gas tank).

Must a propane tank be cylindrical to hold the gas safely? 
What kind of PSI do they hold? My scuba tanks are rated for 
3000 PSI and I assume they too are cylindrical for 
engineering reasons.

In an ideal world, laws of physics aside (OK maybe the sides 
could be rounded), I would love to get a tank that was only 
about 4 to 6&quot; tall x 12&quot; wide x 36&quot; long. This would fit 
neatly under each sliding door.

What about the possibility of putting two 6&quot; tanks side by 
side between the fame rails for a total of 4 tanks? How 
would you link them all together? How would you do a fill?

Just dreaming...
Chris
