Subject: Re: warming up the engine ...

Michael:  The guy who wrote the vw for complete idiots book (which i
had years ago, when I had a '68 bus) said, simply enough, that most
engine wear occurs while engine parts are cold, viz., just after
starting.  So idling for a minute or two, to warmitup!, as author put
it, supposed to reduce wear.  Cheers, Art
