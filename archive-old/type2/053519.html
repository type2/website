&gt; I plan to drive my newly acquired '73 Bus from its current home in So Cal to

&gt; Assuming the vehicle is in reasonable running condition is there anything I

&gt; water-cooled car?

.  Take California highway #1
.  roll down the window
.  enjoy the scenery
.  take a cell phone, but leave it turned off

have a great trip
