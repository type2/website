Subject: Thermostat adjustment

I finally got around to hooking up my thermostat on my '77 bus.  I believe
I hooked it up correctely and that everything is in place.  Now, I commute
to work (about 20 minutes) and after that 20 minutes the flaps are not 
opening completely.  They are certainly open more than when the engine is cold
but not all of the way open.  The outside temperature in between 40 and 50 F.
The thermostat is brand new.  
How long should it take to open up all of the way?
Should it be opening all of the way?
How to fix the problem (if there is one)?

The engine seems nice and cool as usual but due to my limited experiance that
is just my judgement call (I have never felt another air cooled VW for engine
warmth!!!).
