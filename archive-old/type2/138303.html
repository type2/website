Subject: Re: [T2] 1973 1.7 fuel injected ???

Hi Phil,

Exactly correct, I have owned 1.7L and 1.8L engines with these PITA 
ports in the heads. When a plug pops out the engine makes a hell of a 
racket.

I'd just like to add that there were 1.7L FI engines in VW 411's, 412's 
and porsche 914's, we (My dad, brothers and I) are currently working 
with a 411 engine for my Dad's project westy &quot;Franklin&quot;. These engines 
used Bosch &quot;D-Jet&quot; fuel injection, the precursor to the L-Jet FI that 
our buses use. Those heads are identified by a 12mm breather fitting 
that is plumbed to the case breather with thick vacuum line.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Nope, standard issue 1.7 L heads, the 10mm stud that
&gt; you are talking about is a exhast port used on the
&gt; smog control, exhaust gas ported back to the intake,
&gt; most likley welded shut.
