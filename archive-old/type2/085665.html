Subject: Is there an artist in the House?

Hey List -

I'm looking for a logo for my upcoming website, &quot;Save the Bays&quot;.

I would like something simple, like the Jerry Garcia Splitty sheading a tear 
(you know, the pencil art one of the front-end of a splitty). Except the 
front-end of a Baywindow, no spare tire, and with the low turn signals.

I think 400-pixels * 400-pixels is a good size.

Any talented folks out there?

Thanks -

Mike &amp; Itch
&quot;Save the Bays!&quot;
