Eckie:
Good point. They usually are professionals and somewhat attuned to the
inherent dangers of mixing welding and gasoline.
Another point: Bus owners (and bug owners too) DO hav a special problem
unlike any other modern automobiles in that they have a gravity fed fuel
pump. In other words, cut your fuel line and all the gas runs out. I
think most American cars haven't been that way for many years. Buses
burn with alarming regularity becaus of this and a few other
complications. I've purchased 3 locally, 2 that I restored and one that
I junked out.
My ranting about this may be a bit tiresome, but if we never had to hear
about another list member being in the hospital with burns or dead like
that guy in the UK it will be worth it.
PLEASE CONSIDER WHAT CAN GO WRONG BEFORE WORKING WITH GASOLINE OR FIRE!!
