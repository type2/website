Eric, If it is a simple valve job and the bux are too high, do it yourself.
You can, its easier than sending email. Borrow Muir, dissasemble according
to instructions, I recommend new valves, not too expensive, put in, lap and
reassemble again.Seek advice. Archives at type2_dot_com, Tech pages there too.
Get inspired. Not a huge job and VERY gratifying. Get a friend to help, it
should cost, with gaskets, very little indeed. At the very least disassemble
yrself and take heads to the shop. Try it, you will like it.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Ok, well I'm new to this list, and have been waiting for somebody to post
&gt; about valve jobs the past couple weeks, but it hasn't happened.
&gt; Well heres
&gt; the deal. Theres a pretty nice &quot;Poo Brown&quot; 78 Camper 2 blocks
&gt; from my house
&gt; that is just asking me to restore it. The interior is inact and
&gt; it doesn't
&gt; need much body work, but it does need a full valve job. The owners from
&gt; Washington and she has offered me a fair price, but I know nothing about
&gt; working valve jobs.
&gt;
&gt;     I've learned that it has a new 1800cc engine, and has had
&gt; alot of other
&gt; mechanical work done to it in the past 2 years. I have asked a friend who
&gt; owns a bus, and he thinks it'll cost me around a grand, and thats way too
&gt; pricy for me right now if I want to maintain it. Owning a
&gt; Bay-Camper has been
&gt; a dream of mine for years, and I'm sure alot of you remeber my
&gt; screename from
&gt; contacting you over the past couple years about you buses for
&gt; sale, well I
&gt; remeber all yours at least. I'm just wondering if this bus is
&gt; &quot;The One&quot;. Any
&gt; information would be appreciated, I am willing to do any work on
&gt; my own, but
&gt; I have 0 expirence w/ working on Vw's or any car for that matter. You can
&gt; e-mail me privatelly or post to the list.
&gt;
&gt;     Thanks in Advance,
&gt;
&gt;       Eric Farnan
&gt;       Chicago, IL
&gt;  Possible New Owner of a 78 Westy
