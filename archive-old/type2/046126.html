&gt; OK, here's a design project for a mechanical expert. 
&gt; How do you design and add a nose to a bus so as to
&gt; improve crashability?  I have a brick (1980 Westy),
&gt; and even it could use extra crush space.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm always impressed by those college design projects
&gt; that try to keep eggs from breaking when they fall
&gt; from a certain height (a la Humpty Dumpty).  What
&gt; doesn't work is trying to protect the eggs with soft
&gt; cushy material.  The designs that keep the eggs from
&gt; breaking, of course,  are those that add a crush space
&gt; to absorb the energy of the fall.
&gt; 
&gt; A great design for a bus would probably involve a
&gt; light weight nose with just the right amount of
&gt; stiffness to improve crashability.  Maybe the nose
&gt; could be dual purpose, and provide extra storage for
&gt; light weight items like lawn chairs.  Oh by the way,
&gt; it would also be great if this nose was
&gt; aerodynamically shaped so it improved the bus' gas
&gt; mileage.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone want to form a team to explore this mechanical
&gt; engineering challenge and improve bus safety?  Hey,
&gt; maybe it's as simple as a cleverly designed tire
&gt; carrier/4X4 like protector for the front.

It's all a matter of distance.  If you increase the distance through which
you move from the point of impact to the point where you stop, you will
reduce the forces imposed on your body, and therefore the injuries will
be lessened

Actually engineering this is the trick.  You have to make the &quot;nose&quot; stiff
enough to absorb the energy of the crash, but not so stiff as to prevent
the nose from collapsing.

In any case, this will add at least 2m to the length of the bus to provide
a good crush zone.  It would certainly look odd!
