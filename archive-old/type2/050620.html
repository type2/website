Subject: Re: [T2] piston O rings vs. new pistons and rebuilt heads ?

David Kelly sends:

&gt; This is my first time writing to the list. I have a question. I own a 1973 vw
&gt; transporter that has a 1972 engine with stock automatic tranny in it. I would
&gt; like to rebuild the engine but should I buy a kit that has new pistons or the
&gt; kit that just comes with new piston O rings? My other question is, should I
&gt; buy new heads or refurbished ones?

When you buy a set of VW &quot;p&amp;c's&quot; you get an extraordinarily heavy box
containing four cylinders, four pistons with wrist pins and keepers, and
four sets of rings. Use everything in there.

Heads? Up to you. A company called AVP makes a nice rebuilt head; there are
also new ones but they're $450 per. If you have the $900, go for new.
