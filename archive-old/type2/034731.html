Stephen -

I wanted to get the 4.57 R&amp;P in my '69 (which had a stock 5.375 tranny at
the time). I went to a local tranny builder, and he showed me why the 4.57
R&amp;P from the 091 wouldn't fit in the 002. The opposite, I'm sure, is true -
the 5.375 gears will NOT fit in the 091.

I have a Weddle Eng Catalog around somewhere. I'll take a look to see what
custom R&amp;P's they have for the 091. It's only money, right?

&gt; &gt;Is it possible to install
&gt; &gt;the ring and pinion gearset out of a 1600 bus into this transaxle
