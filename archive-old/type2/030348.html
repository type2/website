Volks,

Another copy of the happy99 virus has gotten thru :-(  I am at this point
very angry at myself and the universe in general, which means that I
should probably be taking a deep breath and not composing a post, but I
feel I have to.  If anyone out there knows procmail and wants to take a
hack at writing a recipe to eliminate it, I would love to hear from you.

*YOU* are responsible for the mail you send.  If a copy of that virusor
any other virus reaches the list from you, you will be removed from the
list and banned.  In addition, over the weekend, the conversation seems to
have drifted rather far afield.  Any future posts on the following
subjects will get you removed from and banned from the type2 list:

Posting a virus;

Internet Access Fees or other &quot;current&quot; affairs in *any* country;

*Any* post mentioning bugs, Type3's, 411's, 412's, 1950-1967 buses, or
watercooled buses;

Mac, IBM, Unix, Linux, etc. computers.

I don't know what has gotten into the air recently, but....

THE TOPIC IS BUSES!!  AIR-COOLED BUSES BUILT AFTER 1967!!!!

One subject that has a problem is current production Mexican, Brazilian,
and South African buses.  I *know* that they exist, and I know that they
are importable into many countries around the world, BUT THEY ARE NOT
IMPORTABLE INTO THE UNITED STATES!!! While, by the charter, they are
theoreticaly covered by this list, in actuality, every time the subject
comes up, we get a couple of really useless posts on &quot;Can I get one&quot; from
US list members.  As result, I would dearly appreciate it if we could keep
list traffic in these buses to a minimum.

                           Administrator, Type2 list
