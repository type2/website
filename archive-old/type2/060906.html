Subject: Tires

Hey Y'all, 
  I know this is a sore subject with some, so I'm not here to ask for 
opinoins. I want to tell you all what I found and not start another 
thread about tires.
   I was at my local Les Schabs ( a NW tire dealer) and got tires for my 
wifes car. I asked about Bus tires while I was there. Here is what I 
learned. They have a 8 ply tire for the Bus made by Jupiter ( a privite 
label Kelly) four tires $301.00. Then a 6 ply made by Kuhmo for 275.00. 
Both of these tires are a hyway tread and he said they last about 30-40k 
mikes. The other option was the Toyo Z800 ultra. This is a T rated tire 
and has a 80k mile warranty. He said that the tire is a heavy load tire 
that can be inflated to 44 psi. and they would stand behind it on this 
application. Before you throw tones and say they are young and stupid, 
the man I talked to was the owner of the store, in his late 50's and in 
the tire bussiness for almost thirty years. This store also has an 
outstanding reputation so I trust him. Best part is that the tires are 
only $307.00 for the four and are good for 80k. If you want to know more 
you can talk to me privately. ( I don't want to start something bad) I 
will get some of these as soon as I can get $300 and will give you a 
report on them. If anyone has them on there Bus I would love to haer 
from you.
