Maybe something old and dirty got sucked into your
fan, that would explain the rumbling noise and the
dust blowing out of the vents.  Although it really
doesn't explain why the bus cut out, unless it was
something big enough to catch and stop the fan from
turning thus stopping the generator from turn thus
stopping the crank pulley???
