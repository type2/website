there are two basic series of automatic tranny's in buses, the early ones
with vacuum shifting,  (up to 75) and the later tranny which has a govenor
shifter (76-81)  both are basically a rabbit (Golf) transmission with
different final drives.

there are some parts that are harder to come by, but then again all buses
have some parts that are hard to find.  (torque conertors seem to be the
hardest to find)  

they are not as tough as the manual but they are not that fragile either,
they are pretty reliable though, however remember the bus is notoriously
underpowered, especially before the 2liter engine, the automatic makes
this especially apparent.  you will never be the first up the hill, but it
will downshift and keep going.  If you live in the big city and do a lot
of stop and go, it might be a more efficient or reliable unit.
