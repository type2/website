Sucess!!!!  We have them both back in place with some help form a little tape.  Thanks to everyone who replied to me with sugestions and advice.  The directions in the type2 library were excellent!  (up until that last little bit)  This list is a wonderful idea, and has helped me out of many messes before I got myself into them.  
I purchased my new arms from a mechanic here on the list &quot;orangevw&quot;  aka Bob  (orangevw_at_email.msn_dot_com).  Listen guys .... he is the best person to do business with, reasonable and honest.  If I didn't live on the other side os the US, he would be the only person that I would take my bus to.  Customer service is #1, and that is VERY hard to find.  So again thanks to everyone who lended a hand in this and Kudos to &quot;Bob&quot; making this experience even more enjoyable!  
Peace,
Jaime Walker

I recently purchased a set of torion arms to replace my upper and lower ball joints on my 68 westy.  I followed the directions that are listed in the type2 library, and things went great.  Everything came off with out a problem, ..... then it came time to put the new ones back on.  They will not go back on.  The arms slide on and goes about 1.5&quot; away from where they need to be and then stop.  According to the directions you just need to hammer them on and they should go pretty easy. We hammered for 2hrs and they wont go.  We did get the passenger side on with only a little trouble, but the driver side is just being a real PITA!!!  I know that when the arm is lined up correctly it kind-of catches and you can feel that is where it needs to be.  This is how we got the passenger side on, but we are not feeling that on the drivers side.  In the directions, it says that you can't put them on one at a tiem, and that they not have to be somewhat in place before you drive them in.  Do !
you have to drive them in at the same time?  Really volks, I am out of ideas and dont' know what to do.  I have to have this thing back on the road ASAP.  My other car is going into the shop and I had planned on using this one.  The one thing that troubles me is that the one that we are having problems with was shipped seporately from the rest.  I have looked down the arm with a flashlight to see the design that it has, and they appear to be the same.  I hope that there are no problems with the arm itself, and that we are just missing the &quot;trick&quot; on how to get these things back in.  We did try to put the old one back on just to see if there was something wrong with the new arm, and we had the same problems with the old one as well. Any help on the matter would greatly be appriciated!!!  Hope everyone has a good Monday!

Peace
