Subject: RE: [T2] VW's take on tires - Owner's manual and Bently specify
    these  tires.

&gt; I think this is why some of us like to play ball with these vehicles.
&gt; If you have a background/interest in the sciences/engineering fields,
&gt; then the engineering levels achieved by VW in an entry level vehicle
&gt; are inherently appealing to anyone interested in maintaining a good
&gt; cost-per-mile average.
&gt;
&gt; I trust in, and enjoy duplicating the specifications long ago
&gt; determined by those who knew best.
&gt;
&gt; Why people on these lists attempt to constantly re-engineer the
&gt; vehicles with toolboxes full of rationalizations is a mystery.

is it re-engineer or apply advancements in auto technology to our clasic
vehicles.  everything from advances in tire design to synthetic lubricants
these have all come to fruition in recent years, when I first put radials
on my bus there was only one dealer in the area that even carried em, and
you could buy Michelins and that was that.

the 78 I have now is the only one I have owned that even had a spec for
radials.   LT tires especially have come a long long way.
