Exactly so, Chris :-)

&gt; I can start the bus in neutral, and she starts right up. .....However, if I
&gt; try to change gears while it is running, it jumps and cuts off, as if I was
&gt; switching gears without pushing in the clutch. If I try to start it up in
&gt; gear, with the clutch down, it jumps like the clutch wasn't held down. I have
&gt; good freeplay, and the tranny should be pretty good.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions, conclusions?

Chris,

You have one of two possible problems.  Either the cable is breaking or
the arm on your throwout arm is breaking.  Since the former costs ~$10 to
fix and the latter requires engine removal, I'd pull and replace the
clutch cable first, then the engine if that didn't work.  A lot of times,
the cable will break strand by strand and stretch as it does.  In this
case the pedal will feel normal when the engine is off, but the cable is
still stretched and will not operate the clutch.  I would go with this
first (and keep my fingers crossed :-)
