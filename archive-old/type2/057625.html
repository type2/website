Subject: Engine Pull Questions

Greetings List:

I'm getting ready to pull the engine on my 79 so I can install rebuilt AVP
heads, and I've got a question after reading the engine pull procedures.
The way I understand the process, the engine mounts and rear transmission
mounts are removed then the engine/transmission are dropped down until the
engine is clear of the rear body area of the van.  The engine is then
separated from the transmission.  Right!?  My question is whether the front
transmission mounts and transmission shift linkage must be disconnected in
order to prevent damage/bending.  Any ideas or suggestions are welcomed.
I'm on digest so please respond via pmail (and list also) so I get the info
sooner.

Thanx
