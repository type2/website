Subject: Re: [T2] The ramifications of high crankcase pressure

hello Greg    Glad to see guys made it home OK  It was fun at Dixiebus  My 
old panel did real well except it developed an oil leak that I think is coming 
from the push tubes for some reason still too tired from driving that damn West 
Va turnpike .  On your bus check the breather on top of the motor and make 
sure it is clear, where do you have the breather hose running to . you might 
want to run it to an old oil bottle and take it out of the suction  you should be 
able to nurse it thur this season regardless .   Again it was good to see you 
guys and will see you at John Browns   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
