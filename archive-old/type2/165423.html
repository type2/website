Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Door Seals....

I agree completely, that's why I think it's ridiculous. Of course, to put things into perspective. I start the car up maybe once a month and I've driven it less than 4 times in the past 2 years.

I started trimming the gaskets slightly in hopes that would fix the problem, but it didn't seem to do anything. 

I may just end up getting a whole new set. Someone else responded saying that there is a set that doesn't have this issue. Maybe it has to do with Brazilian busses VS US busses?

&gt; New cars don't have this issue? Maybe the seals are a tad too thick. I can't imagine having to SLAM my doors for 2 years and being told that it is a natural thing to do! Even if rather than &quot;slamming&quot; you can &quot;firmly&quot; close the doors, it still seems like the wrong thing to do.
