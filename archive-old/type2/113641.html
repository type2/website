Subject: Re: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

Wow! Bus folks must be WAY more passionate about their sparkplugs than they 
are their tires....

Enjoying the thread all the same folks...

Me? What do I use?

Well, after bad experiences with Champion and Autolite I don't use them. 
Engines would not tune with them and I don't know why. The Autolites were 
used on a Mazda Rotary engine and that engine requires two different plugs. 
Autolite's catalog specified 1 plug style. Engine went from running good to 
bad with new Autolites and then back to good with a set of Bosch or NGK 
plugs (I don't know which). Champion has been bad for me in several engines.

Now I just use cheap NGK and cheap Bosch plugs with good results. Probably 
change them more often than necessary. (10K).
