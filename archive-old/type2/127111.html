Subject: Re: [T2] 1972 Bus alternator HELP...

&gt;If you have a black wire,,,  

My documentation with my alternator said some had
ground wires.  I think it specifically said that
some motorola's were on some VW's.  Makes sense
'cause black is ground in 'mericun wiring. 
(Brown is ground in euro wiring.)  Right?
