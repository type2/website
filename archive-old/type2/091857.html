Subject: Re: [T2] Another 6 to 12V question

In a 65 conversion forgot the flasher -- fried it.  I a 52-53?? ford 
missed two relays.  one fried and we found it by smell.  recommend 
changing them.  BTW Didnt notice if you had carbs.  The chokes will need 
to be replaced or a resistor mounted.

&gt; When doing
&gt; a 6V to 12V conversion, do you have to replace all the 6V relays with 
&gt; 12V?
