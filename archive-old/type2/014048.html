Subject: Re: 100%


&lt;snip&gt;
...I'm eager to drive it...chipped paint and all...My 
question is...would it be out of line to drive it or should
I wait until I have it fixed 100% to drive it?
&lt;/snip&gt;

If I waited till everything wuz 100% on das bus..... well I
would walking alot.
  Seriously. The brake system should be as close to 100% as
you can get it.... everything else should be working. The
only 100% buses you will see are pulled to VW shows on
trailers. Yea yea I know, some listies would be awfull
close to 100% with thier daily drivers.

  The buses in Mexico are water cooled... the only air
cooled bus I have seen down there had Canadian plates on
it.
doesnt mean there arent any but all the ones I saw were H20.
