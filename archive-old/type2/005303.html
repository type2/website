&gt; This weekend, I took my 1971 bubbletop camping up to Northern California.
While I was happily cruising _at_ 55-60 MPH, when, all of a sudden, the bus
started accelerating by itself, and there was nothing I could do!!!
&gt; I could not get it out of gear, and braking the bus was out of the
question!! (Overheated brakes from trying to stop the bus my brakes)

I don't understand.  If the engine races on a manual transmission vehicle,
the solution is very simple.  Push the clutch in and hold it in.  The engine
can race all it wants but cannot drive the vehicle.  If you don't want the
engine to race like that, very simply turn the key off (then turn it back on
so you can still steer).  A broken spring on the carb would not have
prevented you from doing either of those things.
