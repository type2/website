Yeah, Get the compression tester!!!  Seriously.  Go to the local FLAPS and 
fork over the $30 for it.  Then spend the half hour performing the test 
yourself.  Until you verify that you have good compression, you are wasting 
100% of your time investigating other potential problems.  I never assume 
anything with my bus, especially that parts that someone else has rebuilt 
will work.  You shouldn't either.

Let us know the results of the compression test -  then we can do some 
serious troubleshooting/diagnosis.
