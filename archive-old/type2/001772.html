Subject: Berg shifter list discount--not going to happen!

Talked with Mrs. Berg today, and the only discount they would give would be
in quantity of 15 or more, and that would only be 10%.  For the basic
non-locking model, the discounted price not including freight would have
been around $163.

Since the replies I received are requests for various models, the numbers
are not there.
