As the goddess of the vw list surveys I just want to say that your survey idea is great! The trick is to find someone who is just as big a vw nut as yourself and then the collection and fun will only double.If you have to choose I would personally keep my vw.Alright,so I'm not married, but if they can't love my vw then they can't love me!
