Subject: Re: Ethanol fuel

VW do Brasil had vehicles that ran on pure ethanol.  Big jets are needed,
fuel economy is much less, and cold-starting is harder.  You might
experience corrosion if the fuel system components aren't compatible.

&gt; Anyone had experience with running a VW (or other air-cooled) motor on straight
