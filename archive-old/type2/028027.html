Harry and others,

I'm not really sure if there's a need for a multi-pass external cooler for a Type 4...I'm not very experienced with these at all. I suppose it depends on your application and driving habits. In all honesty, I'm going to put my money into gauges and sending units so I can monitor temperature, pressure, vacuum, and alternator output (amperage). More experienced hobbiests (and actual mechanics) may disagree, but I think the most important upgrade for me is to the information systems of the bus. I'll use the upgraded IS department to monitor performance and adjust my driving habits...and/or prescribe repairs.

Thanks! Joe
