&lt;&lt; My neighbor got one of those 250 ft/lb ones for the rear axle nut 
application. &gt;&gt;
    I recently had to remove the rear axle nut off my '74 Bug, got a 36 mm 
socket and put it on my Craftsman 1/2 inch drive, and using a 3' pipe as a 
breaker bar proceeded to break the Craftsman drive. Took the socket and half 
inch drive to the basement and welded the socket ( I realize not everyone has 
a MIG welder laying around) to the drive, and I now have a specific use axle 
nut tool! Hey, it worked.      Jeff
