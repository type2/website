Shawn,
head over to costco, they sell a combo 3ton hyd jack and two 3ton stands.
Look to be pretty good quality. I've found crappy tires stuff to be
overpriced.

Subject: [T2] What kind of Jacks/Stands to Buy


&gt;
&gt; Greetings,
&gt;
&gt; I want to buy some jack and stands for my bus.  I currently own no jacks
or
&gt; stands.
&gt;
&gt; What I need is Jacks that will allow me to do all repair and maintenance
on
&gt; my bus, including any engine or brake work.  Obviously, safety is a
factor,
&gt; so I want jacks &amp; jack stands that will let me work under the bus without
&gt; fear of the house falling down.
&gt;
&gt; Can someone please advise what I require in terms of jacks / stands.  Also
&gt; appreciated would be a description of minimum and maximum requirements.
&gt; For example, perhaps a suggested starter kit to get me off and going, then
&gt; the 'good-to-have' additions that can follow later, if req'd.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for the continued support.
&gt;
&gt; Regards.
&gt; Shawn Luft

&gt; '73 Bus imported from Louisiana to Quebec - upcoming inspection asap.
