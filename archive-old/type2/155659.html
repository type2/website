Subject: Re: [T2] Reminder: Push starting FI with dead battery = waste
  of time

&gt; hey Don  Then all you would have is two dead batteries  LOL    Get one of
&gt; those jumper boxes, real handy and easy to carry from car to car to house to
&gt; wherever  later  mark Dearing
&gt;

Not if I wire it correctly so it only draws from the starting battery, never
feeding to it. Then if I need to use it to start I can run jumper cables in
the engine compartment. Or I could wire a switch with some heavy cabling.
But that seems more work than necessary.
