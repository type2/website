Subject: Merry Busmas! Ho ho ho!

Happy holidays everyone!

I've got some gifts in my closet that Santa (otherwise known as my loving
wife) suggested I offer to the list. :) So, if you've been nice (no naughty
need apply) please respond via p-mail, and I'll get them in the mail to you
right *after* Christmas (sorry, won't make it under your tree in time!).
First come, first served. Tell me in your email which part you need.

one 75-78 heat exchanger, passenger side, used, clean, and in very nice
shape
one spare tire hanger for the front of your bus
one FI brain, 022 906 021S. I think it's good, but no guarantees
one new foam engine seal for a type IV bus

I had these for a project I no longer have.

Merry Christmas to all,

Jeff
