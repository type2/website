&lt;&lt; I have a few videos that show snippets only. A whole bunch of factory VW 
and Porsche photos can be found in &quot;Excellence Was Expected&quot;, the 
definitive history of Herr Dok. Ing. Ferdinand Porsche and his sons. 
Original editions in good condition go for $100 or more. The current 3 
volume updated version is way spendy. My brother has many VW books showing 
inside factory pics, so start cruising the local book stores, or search at 
Powells_dot_com. Super service and huge inventory used and new books. Full 
downtown block, 3 stories, and several mall stores in the area of Portland, 
Oregon.

If you're a serious (or even comedic) reader
&lt;&lt;  www.addall_dot_com &gt;&gt;
is a superb way to search through the shelves
of many book sellers without leaving home.
Great for pre-read books too... ;-)
