Subject: engine door seal

Hey, Guys.  I just got a new seal for my engine compartment  door.  Haven't had one on it since I got the bus.  Question  is: which way does it go?  I tried it with the thicker part toward  the engine and it doesn't seem to fit.  Does the thinner side go  to the back and the thicker side fits around the outside of the  door?  Also, what would be the best glue to use on it?  I'm  thinking this will keep the engine compartment cooler.  Thanks...KR
