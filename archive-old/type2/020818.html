Subject: Universal H-case?

I had the day off today so I decided to swap motors in my 71 as its 
current engine is failing and I just picked up a rebuilt engine a bit 
ago.  To do the swap I needed to change flywheels and install the rear 
engine hanger adapter on the new motor as I didn't think it was a 
universal case, maybe it isn't.  I went to install it and noticed that 
the bosses are on this engine, but its a H-case engine.  None of the 
bosses are tapped, but the right and lower bosses have holes drilled in 
them, and the left boss has nothing done to it.  Is this a universal 
case that just hasn't been tapped?  Can I drill and tap it with no 
worries?  What size tap/drill bit do I use?

Check out a picture of what I'm talking about at

Sure this is a late model bus, but the engine is a type1 engine and some 
of you vintagebus guys may be able to shed some light on it, hence the 
cross post.

Thanks!
