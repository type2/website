Subject: Re: [T2] Chassis black

&gt;Totally restoring my front axle and have sand blasted it and was going
&gt;to have it powder coated but then remembered a product I heard about
&gt;called Chassis Black from Eastwood and was wondering if anybody has used
&gt;this product and how pleased were they with the results?

The Eastwood chassis black is not any more durable than say Rustoleum, just 
a bit more expensive. It's bragging right is that is just the &quot;perfect&quot; 
balance of shiny and flat - a semi-gloss - to match the factory black 
chassis paints. I've got a really picky Corvette friend that tells me 
Rustoleum barbeque black is very close to what he describes as the perfect 
black too. Dunno - try it and see what you think.

I agree with Terry K. - bedliner paints are incredibly strong. I have a 
friend in the business. I plan to do the bottom 4&quot; of the interior of my 
bus (in the cargo area) and the bottom of my Beetle. My friend in the 
business told me a story of a fellow that would come in from time to time 
to get some boots sprayed. No it's not flexible but on the sole it wore a 
long time. Don't quite see the advantage to it but that fellow was happy...
