Subject: Everybus

Hello everybody,
On the everybus website it says April 15-18
And then right below it as part of the logo that looks like the Krispy Kream 
logo it says the 16-18
So which one is it?
Also, can you bring dogs?
Also, does anyone need any parts? No engine or tranny parts, but lots of 
other stuff.
from a 78 and a 7? (early poptop and camping interior w/jumpseat and clothes 
cabinet on passenger side, but type IV engine). If anyone is interested in 
these parts I'll try and find out what year they are. I'm not really trying 
to make a ton of money on the parts (but enough to pay for the towing of the 
buses) Plus I'm more than happy to trade.  Other than that I'm just trying 
to help people out, so even if you think you can't afford it let me know 
what you need and I'll see if I've got it.
Hope I can help.
Thanks,
Kyle
