&lt;&lt;  Safelite owes him a new seal and properly installed glass.
 Sending a guy out with another can of silicone is the sign of a low class
 shop employing high school drop outs managed by a shifty lowlife scum &gt;&gt;
The last time I had a windshield replaced ( Safelite, Springfield, VA.) was 
on a 
GMC van. It leaked so bad I kept a roll of paper towels on the dash. First 
time I
called Safelite back, the guy said he could'nt get anybody out that day, he 
had three installers, two did'nt show for work, the other was in jail! Class 
operation. After three trys by Safelite to fix the leak, including a very 
sloppy application of black goo, I finally got the windshield to stop 
dripping water on me.... I sold the van.  Jeff S

BTW, my insurance company, Geico, sent me to Safelite!
