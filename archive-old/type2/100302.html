The 6% CO (higher than normal) indicates that the lambda control loop is not 
working since the loop should  hold CO to ~ 0.8%.  Key components of this 
loop are the ECU and the exhaust gas oxygen sensor (located  ahead of the 
cat converter).


It is not clear if the lambda system has a failed component or if it is 
being overwhelmed indirectly by some other failed or out of adjustment 
component. Rough ide may mean the lambda system is &quot;hunting&quot; but can't quite 
lock on.

Some things to consider:

1. 6% CO means that the engine is running  rich. ( But engine should idle OK 
at 6% CO if ALL injectors are working properly).
a. Temp sensors I and II. (Both should measure around 300 ohms  with warm 
engine).
b. CO adjustment on intake air sensor. (interacts with idle adjust on 
throttle  control)
c. Leaky cold start valve.
d  Leaky fuel injector(s).
c. High fuel pressure. (Vac not connecter to pressure regulator or failed 
regulator).

2. A properly operating  lambda system would try to correct this to the 
lower figure to  ~ 0.8%. (The lambda system can't work until the engine is 
warmed up so it operates open loop. )
a. Substitute known good intake air sensor.
c. Substitute known good intake ECU.
b.  Replace  oxygen sensor.

3. An air leak LOWERS the CO%, so you are running high CO in spite of any 
leaks.

4. Your mechanic may be good at finding air leaks but find some one who 
understands the fuel injection system on YOUR bus and is equipped to work on 
it (CO tester, substitute components, shop manual) . This guy does not  know 
where to go next.  This could be a long learning experience for him and an 
expensive (shop time)  one for you.  He may have knocked off a wire or vac 
hose during his hunt for a leak.



&gt;find a replacement plenum, since most are from models with an EGR (my Cal
&gt;bus has no EGR), which are quite different.

If you must pull the plenum, try to seal any leaks and reinstall it. 90 % of 
the work is in the pulling unless it is totally rusted out.
