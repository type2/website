Jack, I did a google search,
http://www.google_dot_ca/search?q=leak+down+tester&amp;hl=en&amp;meta=

This found some pages that describe making, and some that sell this device,, 
Of course Snap on has one,, and so does Sears too,, 

Check it out and see what is best for you :-)

&gt; &gt;The differential compression gauge is also a Leak down tester,,
&gt; &gt;it has 2 gauges that are compared to see the difference from the input pressure
&gt; &gt;to the retained pressure in the cylinder
&gt; &gt;Are you familiar with that?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; Jamie:  I&quot;m not. I have a nice compression gauge.   I've tried to use a
&gt; Mityvac gadget as a leak down tester, but this failed miserably.
&gt; Do you know of a source on the web that might have photos of the tester
&gt; that you mention?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Jack
