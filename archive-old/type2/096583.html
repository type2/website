Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy exhaust pipes??

Ralph,

Those are hot air &quot;dumps&quot; because with the heater flaps closed,
they dump hot air circulating thru the heater boxes to the outside.

I *think* the vw ones will fit, but didn't find out until I actually
took one off to take it to the flaps and hand fit some new tubing.

I decided to try it one more time and by carefully twisting and pushing, 
got it to go on ok. 

Once I was sure it would wotk, the other one was easier.

If that fails, take it to the flaps and go thru their selection(also in 
metric sizes).

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; 
&gt;         I have a '78 camper that has what looks like dual exhaust
&gt; pipes.The pipes are located 1 on either side of the motor and are mounted
&gt; to the frame. They are about 2 feet long and attach to a piece of cooling
&gt; tin on the motor via a fresh air/heater hose. The pipes are 2 inch
&gt; outside diameter and I can not find a hose to fit. Beetle hose are almost
&gt; 2 inches but not quite. Anyone know what these are for and where can I
&gt; find a 2 inch hose? TIA
