Subject: Re: [T2] Air-cooled Federal EGR filter and SMOG

&gt; not sure if I want to open up the AFM.  Since I'm only guessing at this 
&gt; point I'll just settle for turning out the CO screw.

that adjustment is for idle only.  I will have very little effect at 
throttle.

Regardless, you're going to have to adjust your mixture somehow, and the 
AFM is the way to do it.  You might want to find a shop that does smog 
tests and have them run it on their dyno (as I did before my test) and 
made sure it was going to pass.  It might cost you 30 bux, but may end 
up saving you more grief in the end.  Then you can leave the box open 
while you tweak it and be happy that your bus is in proper tune and will 
save you a few mpg.

The worst thing that can happen is that it will pass.  Then, if you 
want, reset it back to where it was before.  It's not the horrible black 
box that people think it is.  It's an indexed wheel on a spring.  Turn 
it a couple clicks tighter and voila, you've leaned out your mixture. 
When you're done, turn it back.  It's not a one-way adjustment...

Also, I'd make sure you do a FULL tune up.. plugs, oil, timing, valves, 
check for vacuum leaks.. everything under the sun that you haven't 
already done.

Or drop a megasquirt in there and it'll pass ;)
