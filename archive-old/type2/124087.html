Subject: Intake Manifold Sealing (was erratic idle)

In trying to find the cause of my 'hunting' idle I decided to remove the carb and manifold.  By spraying carb cleaner I found a number of leaks, some at the carb-manifold junction and where the manifold bolts to the block.  As well there are four rubber sections secured by hose clamps where the manifold pipes reach the carb base section of the manifold and I found some leaks here.  Now to my questions:

1) What sort of a sealing compound should I use on the gasket for the carb-manifold junction? I'll avoid RTV if I can.
2) Same as question 1 but where the manifold bolts to the head.
3) This was a 914 FI engine.  On cylinder #3 near the furthest-forward manifold bolt there is something screwed into the block.  It looks a bit like a pipe that has been pinched shut.  Is this a boss for a Temperature sender?

Really I'm just looking for a 'been-there-before' guide to attaching my aftermarket Holley Carb to the engine without leaks.  The final assembly of this engine was obviously done in a hurry.  I pulled different bolts off the studs, some with and some without washers, etc.   I need to make sure that the Holley is sitting tight before I can try to figure it out properly.

Thanks,
Andre
