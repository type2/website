Subject: ball joint boot

Hi Guys,

OK, the boot on one of the ball joints is oozing.  I looked through the
library and the archives - some folks say that replacing the boot alone is
no big deal.  Others say it is just as much work as doing the complete ball
joint job.  And most say to just patch it up with inner tube patching, or a
shopping bag and tape.

Opinion?

Thanks-

Lori
