Hi Ted,

It might be a pain, but I try to change one thing at a time.  The easiest may be
to put the original rockers back on and set up the new carbs again. Try it out.
If all is a go, then it may be associated with the new rockers.

Are you running a stock cam?  The factory cams have slow enough ramp angles to
handle the 1.25 ratio rocker.  A performance cam may not.

Have you checked to see if you are getting into a valve spring bind, or if the
valve spring retainer is contacting the guide?  Are 1.25 rockers causing too
much side thrust, due to the increasesd arc of the rocker, to shift the rockers
sideways, and cause the push rods to contact the tubes?  Are the pushrod tubes
aligned to allow maximum clearence around the pushrods?

Just brain storming here.  Lots of posibilities to explore.

My soap box:   I like to stay mostly stock.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt; Engine runs great- up to 3000 rpm where the power falls off and it starts
&gt; popping.

&gt; Any ideas where to look or what to look for?
