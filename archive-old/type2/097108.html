Subject: fuel pump caution

Hiya Folks,
    Two weekends (Oct. 19th) ago my wife was driving our '71 bus in CT
and broke down.  She had it towed to a friends house, and there it sat
until this past weekend when I could go up to work on it. Based on the
symptoms she told me I was pretty sure the fuel pump had given up.  So
during the intervening week I bought a new pump.  The next day I went
back to my FLAPS and bought a new pump pushrod &quot;just in case&quot;.  Well
it turned out to be a good thing I did.  The new pump was slightly
different from the old one and the pushrod that was in the engine
would have been too short for the pump I bought.  It wasn't short
because it had worn that much, but because it was made that way.  That
new pushrod may have been the best dollar I ever spent.
    So I guess the moral of the story is to make sure you have the
proper pushrod for the pump you are going to install.
