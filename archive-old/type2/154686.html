Subject: RE: [T2] 68-71 Heater Tube Refurbish - RON, can you chime in
  here?

Mike,

I just got the parts from Airhead on Monday so I am pretty sure they are
still carrying them unless they just ran out. I hope not! I am sure Ron has
them.

Hey Jon,
I have some extra tubes and the bubble wrap already so I figure I'll do 
this project.  airheadparts doesn't carry the parts any more, but I 
think bus depot has them.  Are these the correct parts:

http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=113255292P
http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=111819945

I'm not sure about the second one.  Hopefully Ron will be able to 
confirm that the second item is in-fact the part that replaces the 
asbestos collars as described on your site.
