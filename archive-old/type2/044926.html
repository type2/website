Max.....3,000 miles is a _long_ way, anywhere in the world. My wife and 
daughter and I did a trip very similar to the one you plan (Holland-etc.) 
All powered by an air cooled engine. Took about two months. Camped all the way.

We started in Holland and did the reverse of what you describe. We went 
thru France and into Switzerland and then beyond Zermatt by rail staying 
near the Matterhorn for a few days, where we experienced a touch of 
altitude sickness (so watch the altimeter :~)

After Switzerland and most of Italy, we went to Venice and then north 
over/thru the Brenner Pass to Innsbruck, then across to Salzburg, Linz, 
Vienna and Hungary. We caution you about unexpected ice storms and patches 
of icy road in the Swiss Alps and the Dolomites.  And, once some mountain 
sheep kicked down some boulders that bounced off the roadway and smashed a 
headlight. Travel in the Alps provided some magnificent scenery and 
involved considerable risk. We suggest you consider the season in planning 
to being there.

Otherwise, it was a great adventure. We camped outside Salzburg for two 
weeks, studying German culture and language at the Universitat Salzburg. 
Tried talking to campground people in German and they thought I spoke it 
with a French accent. (Can't speak French at all. Oh well.)

I greatly enjoyed your Wales trip report. We only spent a few weeks in 
England and Scotland. Did some sailing in the Firth of Clyde.   Tell us all 
about the next one.

My girlfriend and I have just returned from an eventful trip to
Pembrokeshire, West Wales, .....snip............................
Next trip is going to be a bit longer, ferry to Holland then through
Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and back via Italy and France. Should
be around 3000 miles including going over the Alps, seems like a long trek
to me but I imagine in the states that's not too far. Better get the source
of the fumes by then or I won't get my favorite side of the vans bed back!

I love this list.
