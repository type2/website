Subject: Re: [T2] thermostat question

Hello Chris,

I hate to tell you this but I believe that your
thermostat is bad. From your picture, it appears to be
expanded all the way. At regular outdoor temperatures,
the thermostat should be contracted to about half that
size. a new one will have a threaded &quot;stud&quot; on the end
which the cable threads on to. These thermostats are
sold at busdepot_dot_com. That is where I got mine. Most
used ones that you find in junkyards are bad too so it
is best to buy a new one. I hope that helped. Have a
great day!

&gt; Hola,
&gt; 
&gt; So I have a new thermostat cable, but I cant figure
&gt; out how it actually 
&gt; connects to the thermostat.
&gt; 
&gt; Could you take a look and see if I am missing
&gt; something? Or maybe the 
&gt; thermostat itself is broken?
