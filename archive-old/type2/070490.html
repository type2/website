Subject: More '67 Westy minutia items sought

OK hang in there everyone, its getting close! Soon I will stop groveling for
minutia for the '67 RFH. I'm down to the parts that if any of y'all who are
parting out '67 campers wanna chip in with (sell) these items then cool.
Otherwise I will, for the most part, sleep at night with out them. 

1. 
This time I am seeking the little do-dad that locates in the center of the
main deck floor. Specifically, this is the female recepticle for the main
deck table leg. This recepticle mounts permanently in the center of the
floor and has a coarse thread which matches the bottom end of the hinged
main deck table leg. We have the table and the leg but are missing this base
item. The 1967 Wesfalia parts catalog identifies it as Main Group section
&quot;D&quot; Item 17, Washer/(Gerwindesheibe) part number 231 067 805. Good luck on
finding the part number. The outside diameter should be similar size in as
the O.D. of the mounting part for the table leg. I only have the cheesy
little drawing in the parts catalog for a reference. I can't tell if it is a
flat plate only or includes the female thread thing as well...

2.
Also associated with the main deck table is the Bottom Fastener Item 15,
part number 231 067 211. It is the brass zoobee which mates to the brass
latch (item 8, Top Fastener, part 231-067-259) that mounts on the main deck
table. 

3.
The last item is the aluminum ring that mounts between the interior cargo
door wood paneling and the actual off-white handle on the L-shaped what not
cabinet door. (The rear most of the two cargo doors.) I have the handle and
everything else. I am only seeking the alum. trim ring for now. Sorry no
part number.

Nerd Alert! 
Kind of laughing at myself here ;-)
An update to the question regarding the wall paneling along the drivers side
of the main deck (below the windows). &quot;One or two pieces?&quot;
Answer:
Confirmed as ONE piece according to the fancy dancy official Parts Catalog,
VW Campmobile - 1967 page A-15, illustration 3+A3 item A30, Panel, from
No.8731 (Verkleidung) part 231 067 057A.
So if anybody asks you the answer is &quot;Yes, my Verkleidung should be one
piece!&quot; In reality... do your own thing and be happy. Mine is in two pieces
and I'm proud of it. =)

God Bless and take care...
