Subject: Re: [T2] Repairing a sunroof?

     &quot;Just bought a 78 transporter with a sunroof that has
been sealed up&quot;

    If it's latex bathroom caulk, I highly recommend DAP's product called 
'Caulk-b-gone', you can get it at you local hardware store.  It doesn't work 
on silicone.  It doesn't remove it entirely, but it softens it up allot and 
helps you slide a sharp object through it.  Let it set on the caulk 
overnight.  I took and old flat head screw driver and sharpened one end on 
the grinder.  I stuck the screw driver through the softened caulk and then 
tapped the back (unsharpened side) firmly but carefully with a hammer all 
the way around the sunroof.  I had bad luck with razor blade knives and 
pocket knives, but this method worked well for me.
    Sunroofs are a PITA, but they are worth it.  Parts are expensive, they 
are hard to get right, but once everything is working BOY are they nice!
