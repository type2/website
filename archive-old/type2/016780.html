Subject: Re: Alternate Aux. Battery Locations

&gt;&gt; Joe Wrote:
&gt;&gt; I have a 12-volt fridge/cooker for it and a BN-4 gas heater. And that leads to a problem. The
&gt;&gt;  only place to mount the gas heater is in the engine compartment, which will force the 
&gt;&gt; sacrifice of a good spot for my auxiliary battery (required for my fridge).

&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if I can install the battery somewhere inside the cab and vent it to the outside
&gt;&gt;  of the bus (or into the engine
&gt;&gt; compartment) to release gases when charging. Maybe that's even overkill. I just don't know much 
&gt;&gt; of anything about the gases
&gt;&gt; released by batteries and the dangers thereof. Any insight would be appreciated.


Joe (And List),

I didn't like my aux battery back in the engine compartement either, but
for a different
reason: I have to tip it almost sideways to get it in/out (Acid
spillage). Since I only drive
my bus in the warm half of the year, this operation is done twice a
year. I moved it to the 
interior under the bench seat. I'm sure that it is theroretically a
problem to be venting all 
the hydrogen gas inside the bus, but if you recall, all bugs have the
battery under the back 
seat. This was good enough for me, and I haven't really worried about
additional venting.

The stock aux westy battery only powers the DC fridge. I'm not thrilled
with this, so as an 
additional up-grade while I was re-wiring the aux battery, I also make
the *entire*
vehicle (except the starter) run from the aux battery. This required an
addition of a heavy duty 
relay and some significant wiring. While camping, I no longer worry
about draining my main 
starter battery. Should I every drain my aux completely (it is needed to
power the starter
solenoid) a quick jumper wire will allow me to start the vehicle. If
anyone is interested in 
this modification, I will gladly provide details.
