Subject: Re: cleaning heat risers

&gt;  how is everybody
&gt; cleaning out their heat risers.

this sounds familiar....

high powered lasers, 13 mirrors, and a bottle of mom's spit.





or...




you could take an old clutch cable (or small aircraft cable) and cut it.
Then stick it into your drill....shove the other end in the heat riser, and
pull that trigger!  then when thats done, take a torch to it and burn the
rest of that crap out.  then take the drill to it again.  but sometimes when
this is plugged...it rusts, and then will rust the intake tube above it and
put exhaust into your intake and make your bus run like hell...if it runs at
all.  Ask me how I know ;-)  thanks Jack!

hope I helped....
