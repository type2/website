Subject: Tire Carriers and 'Bull' bars

Back home down under (where women roar and men chunder) it is reasonably
common  to fit a light 'bull' bar to your bus.  This is a device made from
2&quot; steel pipe (about 1/4&quot; wall thickness).  Imagine a piece of pipe which
attaches to the longtiudinal chassis rail, runs out just past the bumper,
bends upwards at 90 degrees (vertical to ground) has another 90 degree bend
(horizontal to ground) runs across the front of the bus, and then back down
to connect to the other longitudinal rail.  Then has another two horizontal
pieces which extend past these verticals to protect the headlights, which
are also gently bent back to floow the contour of the nose.....

Hmmm..so much for ascii art but I hope you get the idea....

Spare wheels are commonly attached to the bull bar, rather than to the
panels on the front of the bus....also very handy for protecting that
precious nose from  hits....they are actually not as butt ugly as you might
think (based on certain ascii art renditions anyway) when properly finished
with curves etc.....and of course, they unbolt reasonably quickly...

Never seen anything like this here in the States.....would there be a
market for this type of thing or are you all reeling in horror at the very
thought?  Or (maybe) there could be legislation which prohibits them?
(hazard to pedestrians or similar?). If anyone is interested I could try
and find a pic of a bus thus equipped........
