Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Drop an engine, giving away a bus

I believe you are right. From '72 on the rear apron was welded in place
rather than bolted. I'm glad mine is a '71 - it makes it easier to work
inside the engine compartment with the engine in place too.

&gt;I thought you could only remove the bumper and slide 
&gt;the engine out on the older busses???
