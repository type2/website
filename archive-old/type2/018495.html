&gt;I've ordered stuff from Europe with no problems before. [..snip..]
&gt;It's no different than buying mailorder in the US. Actually, buying
&gt;&gt;from net dealers is quite a bit safer than buying from regular mail
&gt;order places [...]


Harmon:

I wasn't concerned so much about the safety/security of buying from net
dealers - it was the potential for U.S. Customs hassles that had me
wondering.

Someone did finally respond to me on a newsgroup:

&quot;I bought many parts from the UK - if they ship UPS or regular Post,
it's almost automatic.  The box just shows up at your door, no problem. 
Dunno if there's a limit on value for this type of shipment, but I've
gotten $300+ boxes no problem.  You can't ship assembled engines though,
due to EPA regs.&quot;

It was looking at the Riechert Tuning, site and some of the goodies that
they offer, which got me to thinking about this (again).

I still don't know how import duties (if any) are handled.  Visiting the
U.S. Customs Service web site only leads one off into the fog.
