Subject: Friend needs full flap/thermo/cable assembly T4 motor.

List,
A buddy of mine needs a full assembly of the cooling system in a type 4 
motor. The flaps, the hinge-rod, the thermostat, and cable, for an extra 
engine that he has. If anyone has one, or part of one, that they wouldn't 
mind getting rid of, send me a p-mail.
