Subject: Our friend the Weber carburetor
References: &lt;200012290311.TAA86958_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Well I've scoured the archives and my (rather useless) Weber book and am 
still in the search of some conclusive evidence. Yes, it's the big 
question on everyone's mind: &quot;How do you get that Weber carburetor working?&quot;

First some statistics: It's a 32/34 DFAV on a '78 Bus with an electric 
fuel pump. I took the whole darn thing apart because it wasn't working 
right and needed a thorough cleaning. After pulling it apart, replacing 
diaphragms and just about everything that could be replaced (except the 
float) I cleaned the sucker with the big bucked 'o carb cleaner and putt 
it back together. I popped it on the engine with the idle adjustment 
screw set at the default 2 turns and it started well enough, and then 
died. So, encouraged, I started it again... same story. I gets a real 
nice start, runs happily for about 2-5 seconds and dies. I proceeded to 
adjust the idle mixture screw every which way imaginable with only 
variable degrees of success.

Still the problem remains, the car will not idle for more than 10 
seconds. And if I get it going, pushing on the accelerator just kills it 
completely. The automatic choke is allright, and the float level is set 
as per the instructions, so I'm thinking that something else is going 
on. My hypothesis is that it's getting gas just fine for a few happy 
seconds and then the float bowl runs out. Is this correct, or should I 
look at other things?

I apologize if this is a repeated question, it's just hard to get 
straight answers for it.

Thank you,
Bj Warminski
