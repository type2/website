Subject: type1 oil filters

Looking through an old CB Performance catalog last night I noticed they had
several different filter options for the type1 engine.  I'm getting ready to
rebuild an engine for my '68 crewcab and had bought a Berg relief oil pump
cover, planning on tapping the case, but these CB products don't require
case tapping.

The first one replaces the oil strainer cover with a larger filter type
element.  Granted, it hangs down a little further, but supposedly it filters
in place of the strainer screen.  Advantages would seem to be instant
filtering on an existing engine and no possible hose problems like with an
external filter.  Disadvantages anyone?

The second item was a replacement oil pump with and inlet and outlet already
tapped and installed.  Seems like you just run hoses to/from2 your external
filter and your done.  Again, keeps you from a case tapping adventure.

Anyone ever use these?  Danger or success stories appreciated.

Thanks,
Dean
