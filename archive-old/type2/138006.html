&gt;&gt;Shouldn't have this kind of difficulty. We were discussing my 73
&gt;&gt;recently which still has the stock carbs. The one thing I like about
&gt;&gt;this westy is that it starts first time every time, no fuss, no muss.

	I agree.  In our 63 DC, push the gas pedal to the floor briefly and
let up.  Turn key and were running.  Honestly it starts quicker than any of
our other vehicles, whether it's a Saturn or a VW.
	Glad to hear you got it up and running though.

Good luck
