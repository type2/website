&gt; How does one remove the key from the slot in the crank. My attempts with
&gt; vice-grips and screwdrivers have thus far failed to separate it from the
&gt; crankshaft as is desired. I haven't tried too hard as yet as I don't want to
&gt; break this part if I can help it. Dealers around these parts stock NOTHING
&gt; for aircooled VW's, you have a minimum 2-day wait until the parts are
&gt; shipped out from the warehouse.

Easy. You need a mechanic's awl and a hammer. Find the space, minuscule as
it may be, between the key and the crankshaft, insert the end of the awl in
this space, and gently tap on the awl with the hammer. The key will come
right out.
