Subject: 70 Microbus for sale in Maryland

As I have previously metioned I bought a 72 camper.  As a
result I need to unload my other bus. Well this is what I have

70 microbus, born June 16, 1970

The body
Original green paint. some surface rust.  Very little body rust.
Structurally the bus is great. Everything works with a few
exceptions.  You need a rear wheel cylinder, and front wheel
cylinder.

Drive Train
It currently has no engine   I have what came out of it in pieces.
A 77 2L.  This is how I bought it.  It has a late model tranny,
rebuilt with 10K miles on it. As a result of the wrong engine the
compartment has been modified to hold it.  Only slight changes,
I think, I never comapared it with a stock compartment.

With an engine and $200 it could be driven daily.  Untill just
before graduation it was my daily driver.  It would also make
a great resotoration project.  This was what I was planning on
doing till I got the camper.

I'm asking $1000 obo.  If you going to put the stock drive train
in it I'll pull the tranny and knock off a couple hundred dollars.

The bus us currently located in Annapolis Maryland.  Please
respond to me not the list.

Brent
