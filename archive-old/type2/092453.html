Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Fill

I havent tried this on a westy or an bus .. but in the past on several 
vehicles i have removed the old fill hole and the short metal piece and 
replaced them from other vehicles.  May seem strange but i just grabbed 
whatever was handy and would fit. and the cap would fit.  The danger 
part is that you may have to remove the tank to safely fasten the new 
filler to the vehicle if it needs to be tack welded and i dont recommend 
using drills that close to an open tank hole.

&gt; Greetings All!
&gt;
&gt; I just need some advise on what to do with the gas fill on my '72 
&gt; Westy.  Not
&gt; the tube itself, there's been enough already written about that, but 
&gt; the top
&gt; where the cap seals it.  Mine, in the years before I bought it, had been
&gt; banged up and deformed so much that the cap no longer seals and I have 
&gt; gas
&gt; come out when I turn left.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt;
