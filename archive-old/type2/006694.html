Hi Roland,

    Did you look to make sure you don't have a condenser at the distributor?
It sounds like you have a radio suppressor on the coil (which is most likely
burnt up if its is as old as you say).
    I think I would start over, replace the points and condenser, in their
stock location, and discard the radio suppressor.
