&gt; Should I be worried about the following.....
&gt;         I was cruising along doing 55mph when I started to climb a long hill.
&gt;         As the car slowed, I applied more pressure to the accelerator, but power
&gt; just seemed to fall away. I geared down into 3rd to pick it up again, but it
&gt; just kept dropping away even though I had my foot flat out on the pedal.
&gt;         I pulled off, kept her running, and went back to listen to the engine...all
&gt; sounded fine. I limped back onto the motorway, thinking of all the possible
&gt; problems, when....as suddenly as it had happened, it went away, and I
&gt; climbed back up to the 50's.....now I can't stop worrying about it.
&gt;         Is it a clutch thing, or was I just putting to much on the gas ??
&gt; ...any thoughts/help would be appreciated.

In addition to all the other things folks have said, it could be the
coil dying.  I have had similar symptoms from a coil that was dying.  It
did the &quot;once in awhile&quot; thing for a while, then quite completely.  I
was sure it was fuel for a long time and it took a total failure to find
it.

HTH... YMMV  :&lt;)
