Good Morning,

And a good morning it is.  I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who 
aided me in fixing my stalling problem on my '79 Bus.  Apparently my dual 
relay is fine.  It turns out the reason my bus was stalling out on me was 
that I had the incorrect coil to go with my electronic ignition.  I put on 
the correct coil and have had no trouble since.  Well, aside from a little 
difficult starting on really cold mornings, the old girl is running 
superbly!!  God it feels good to not be afraid that I am going to die 
somewhere.  Well, at least not for awhile.  Thanks listees!  You have been a 
great help to me and my Isobel.

Respectfully,

Meredith &amp; Isobel '79 Bus
