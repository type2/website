Subject: RE: [T2] Rusty Front Brakes?

&gt;&gt;I noticed that my brake rotors now have a fairly thick coat of
rust from their 6-month hiatus.  My immediate thought was, &quot;what do I do
about that?&quot;, so I thought I would ask The List.&lt;&lt;

Jason,

i would think that if the rotors aren't pitted with rust, you might be ok
with letting the pads do the cleaning for you.  if you are replacing the
rubber hoses take the time to do some extra inspection while you're in
there.

good luck,
