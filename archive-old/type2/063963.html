Subject: Further adventures with oil leak

hey now,

i think i got the oil temp sender leak fixed. i put a washer that has a
hard rubber interior on the back of the sump plate. this should hold up to
temperatures of 400 degrees F or more. i also put a new copper washer on the
outside. is this okay to do? two washers? let me know.

unfortunately, i didn't get the sump plate seal quite right and it *looks*
like it might be seeping a bit. not much. just a little. i'll see how it looks
tommorrow before i drain the oil *again*.is there any way to do this without
draining the oil. i don't think so. just thought i'd ask.
