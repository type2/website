&gt;I've read about this, and it may become reality.  However, I wouldn't
&gt;expect a reincarnation of the the Type 2.

The 1998 South American Type 2 1600 FI Air cooled looks good - available in
the UK from 9995 plus tax.

&gt;The rumor I heard was back torear engine, rear drive.
&gt;The engine will likely not be air-cooled because of emissions issues.
&gt;I also would not expect the front seats to be mounted above the wheels
because of safety issues.

Yes, where would that crumple zone go?

&gt;I would, however, expect to see a new version of the splitty nose.  THAT, I
&gt;think, would help to sell a bunch.

Here we can buy a fiberglass front for the Bay window that turns into a
Split screen.

I would have thought VW unlikly to reincarnate the type 2 as it would be
difficult to adapt a current floorpan to give that rear engine layout.
