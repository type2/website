Subject: [T2] One more on the 68-73 Westies

		I have seen in a picture or two that the wood paneling is
different. I have seen some that looks like a nice stained Mahogany and
others that look like it is a whitewash (Yellowish). 
		Was the stained(like the pre 67) original? What year did it
change? Was it 68-69 only ? Or 68 only? You can see the stained look in this
picture:
