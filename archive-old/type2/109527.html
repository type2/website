Subject: 72 bus

I just bought a 72 today.  On the front of the van, just above the left
headlight there was a rubber plug/gasket covering a hole with what looked to
be three screw holes surrounding it.  Anyone know any reason why that would be
there or was someone just trying to install something after they bought it.

I have a feeling you guys will be getting a lot of questions from me in the
future.  Thanks.
