&quot;I have never even seen a bus with less than 100K let alone 48K.&quot;


Well, when I bought my 71 three years ago it had a real 53K on it, so it
does happen.  My PO had great records all the way back to new, and he'd had
it (second owner) for 27 years.  Maybe an exception, but they ain't all
daily drivers.
