Howdy all!
Just wanted to see who was going to the Central Ohio Vinatge Volkswagen
Club's Volkfest show this Saturday Aug 11 in Columbus Ohio, and also wanted
to see if there is a place where the bus folks will be camping near-by.  I
live pretty close and would love to hook up with some fellow bussers for a
little campground throw down.

headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
