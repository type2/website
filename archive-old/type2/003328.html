There is a product for sale at my flaps that is made for exactly what you
need.  It is like a gallon of fuel but only works in a hot engine.  So if you
run out of gas just pour it in and go.  Not really sure what it is made of or
if it is safe for a bus.  Any one else seen this product.  Had any experience
with it?  If I am the only one that has seen it I will go back and get the
name of it.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
