&gt; Hi all...being new to the &quot;dual carb crowd&quot; I would like opinions on the
&gt; &quot;best&quot; type of carb synchronization tool.  I've found 2 types on CIP1 at
&gt; ....  http://www2.cip1_dot_com/SearchResults.asp?Cat=1809   and would like
&gt; to know if anyone has a preference for either type.

ACC-C10-7115 - aka unisyn is a piece of junk (at least the chinese copies
are junk).

ACC-C10-7125 - aka Synchrometer is the way to go. However, the type of carb
you have will determine what style you need. CIP has the SK style pictured
and you have to determine if it will seal with the throat design of your
carb (on it's own or via rubber adapters), or if you need the BK style.

What carbs do you have?
