Subject: Re: [T2] Trendy Bus Advertisement

This whole thing is just a sick societal trend that is just about
making money instead of providing honest services. VW bucked this
trend, and we are the remnants of those trying to preserve that way of
life.

 &lt;&lt; Who ever invented model years? they're too confusing. &gt;&gt;
 
 FWIW, try getting a copy of Vance Packard's &quot;The Waste
 Makers&quot; for an interesting study of the growth of &quot;model
 years&quot; particularly by American cars in the fifties and
 sixties...There really was no reasonable excuse for mak-
 ing new models every year for a car that had no substantial
 engineering changes. It was a marketing strategy to make
 last year's car look so, well, last  year... ;-(
