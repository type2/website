&gt; Okay listees, this is a Friday survey:
&gt; 
&gt; What is, in your opinion, the most useful, indespensible, 'changed your
&gt; life after you started using it' tool, for working on VW Campers? It
&gt; doesn't have to be big, expensive, complicated or hard-to-find. Just the
&gt; tool that is 'brilliant'.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll start the ball rolling with:      thin-nosed pliers.

Flourescent (sic?) trouble light!  I can prop it up and let it fall
on me with out cooking myself!

Needle nose pliers are nice too, but the light gets my vote.

Mark
