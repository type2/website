Subject: Re: pistons arrived...a question

[...]

&gt; hey volks,
&gt; just a quick question.   my pistons arrived from bus
&gt; depot today.   i was taking a look at them and have a
&gt; question.   the tops of the pistons (they are the
&gt; brazilian replacements) have an aarow on them pointing
&gt; a specific direction.   now which way do these aarows
&gt; have to point on my engine, right side up facing each
&gt; other _-&gt;&lt;-_  not facing each other right side up
&gt; _&lt;--&gt;_, or upside down facing each other, upside down
&gt; not facing each other.   just curious so i can begin
&gt; reassembly tonight!
&gt; thanks

Shelby,

They should all point towards the flywheel...
