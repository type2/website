Subject: Re: [T2] Polishing Aluminum

Chris,

I tried various things on my fan housing(t4) and just could not
come up with anything  that worked for me....so I sent it to the powder
coaters.  

The black is what happens to aluminum when you try to polish it with 
rouge.  

I tried wire brushes, nylock brushes, all kinds of polishes, buffing wheel
with &quot;chrome&quot; rouge sort of worked, but was gonna take about 5.2 years to 
finish.  Lots of black on my polish wheel also....some sort of bead 
blasting might work, but sand blasting just made it clean and &quot;rougher&quot;.

Skip the heartache....unless you have 5.2 years instead of about $75.00.
You've seen my engine pictures....

Cheers, dave

&gt; I'm polishing some aluminum and got some questions. The assembly in 
&gt; question is a Porsche 911 replica cooling fan for my Beetle. My Beetle 
&gt; 
&gt; I cleaned it with Lye. Unfortunately I had to rush off to class (toured the 
&gt; local TRW airbag factory) and did not get the Lye off before it made a mess 
&gt; of the aluminum. All of the mess wet sanded off and now I have a 
&gt; wonderfully clean but dull assembly.
&gt; 
&gt; My polisher is an old electric motor with a polishing wheel (white cotton?) 
&gt; on the end. My polish is some clay stick like polish for aluminum in 
&gt; various grades of coarse, medium, and fine.
&gt; 
&gt; My polishing wheel is at this point black. I have tried cleaning it with a 
&gt; screwdriver and a handsaw blade. These came up with very well polished 
&gt; edges and the wheel marginally cleaner. Should I reverse the wheel rotation 
&gt; (flip it around)? Am I pushing too hard or not hard enough? Sometimes the 
&gt; clay like polish (rouge is it called?) leaves a build up on the aluminum 
&gt; that requires a liquid polish/cleaner to remove. The aluminum is smooth at 
&gt; this point but what will it take to get past the black? I used to think 
&gt; that I wanted to polish my Porsche wheels for this car but now I'm thinking 
&gt; it might be worth painting them instead! &lt;grin&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; The fan should be done tonight but the fan surround I dunno. Help!
