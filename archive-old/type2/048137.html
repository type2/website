&gt; 1)How long do 1800 cc engines usually last before they
&gt; need a rebuild? And how much would a rebuild be?

Should have left the factory with a 2 litre fuel injected motor so I would
have to wonder about what happened to the original motor. If you post the
motor's serial # the list we can tell you what it came out of. A well
maintained and loved pancake can last as long as 200,000 in the best of
cases. I would say 150,000 is a good life.

&gt; 2)Does anyone know of a good mechanic in San Francisco
&gt; where I could get an inspection done?

Not a clue but I understand California is a bit strict about emissions and
having the smog gear installed on the vehicle as it came originally
equipped.

&gt; 3)How much would fixing the parking brake cost and
&gt; could I do it myself?

Do it yourself or carry some bricks.

&gt; It really is a beautiful bus and I have been dying to
&gt; own a bus my entire life.  Any suggestions would be
&gt; greatly appreciated, even reading material.  I've
&gt; skimmed the John Muir Volkswagon's for Idiots book but
&gt; would love to hear any other recommendations.

Don't believe everything you read ESPECIALLY the part about timing your bus.
That info is totally dependent on having original distributor and cards(FI)
installed and working properly. Most buses no longer have that origianl
gear. Get a Bentley Manual as well.

You gotta start somewhere :)
