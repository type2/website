Subject: Re: VW Bus Safety

Thanks to Greg, Sean and al. for their insight and good remarks,
As a lot of listees pointed out, the Transporter seems to be a
fairly safe vehicle; this has to do with its own physical
characteristics but most importantly the attitude of the guy behind the
wheel. I like to think that Transporter drivers are safer and better
drivers than the average car/truck/suv driver. Our individual and
collective wisdom and experience as bus owners is essential, but what I
would actually like to review are actual data of crash tests, etc. done
by Transport Canada or the equivalent US/Euro authorities. Those tests
were already performed even in the 60s, so there must be some hard data
out there, especially since the 68-79 buses are more or less
structurally similar. I searched the internet but from up here accessing
the web is not only painfully costly but slower than a loaded bus
climbing the Rockies.
