Or you can use a hair dryer to heat up the end of the hose.

I'm just now getting caught up on some emails.. I know of a good trick =
for
getting REALLY stubborn hoses on. :0)
Of course, assembly lube or glycerin works well for some jobs.. but =
hoses
can be really stubborn.
I don't know if it will help in this situation, but it might.
First, you've got to get the hose heated up with hot water. That softens =
it
up so that you can slide it on to the tube or fitting.
