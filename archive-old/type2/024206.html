Hi:  

I got your e-mail from a VW mechanic/hobbyist in Encinitas, Calif.  He 
suggested I write.
I'm looking for help in selling my 76 bus.  The engine has been rebuilt and 
has less than 200 miles on it, the tranny was rebuilt about 15,000 miles 
back, BUT after 3 attempts I can't get it smogged and I'm tired of fooling 
with it.   I've decided it may just be best to part it out.  Any suggestions? 
 It's an aftermarket camper, but by now has only the bed.  Body has one small 
crease near the right rear tailight, otherwise is great.

Philip Matzigkeit
