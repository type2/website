&gt; I have what appears to be heater controls on the dash, but no heat seems to be
&gt; forthcoming.  Is this the norm or am i doing something wrong.  Both of the red
&gt; levers are at opposite ends.

It works like this:

- the engine has to warm up first, then throw the lever
- the heater tubes and seals to the fan shroud have to be close to leak free
- the cable to the flapper boxes have to be taught and open the flaps
- the booster fan in the engine compartment has to be running (check the
fuse, see it turn, they can seize after lack of use)
