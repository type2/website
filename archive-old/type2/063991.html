Bill,
Since you don't have the left and right rear air ducts (GET 'EM, cooling for 2 &amp;
4 will suffer if you don't, also offers protection for the pushrod tubes from
road debris) you should have plain view of the thermostat. It can be easily
removed with no further interference.

I agree with you on the Bently description of the proceedure to adjust the
thermostat cable. Doesn't even say whether the engine should be at operating
temps or dead cold! Glaring error, IMHO. Or, maybe it's so obvious to the tech
writers that they didn't even notice.
Haynes does a little better in this one proceedure. &quot;When the thermostat is
refitted and back to room temp. check the flap setting. Loosen the screw that
holds the cooling air control cable on to the control flap shaft. Hold the flaps
in the fully closed position (*my note... fully closed is AGAINST the spring.
The default position of the flaps is OPEN*) and tighten the screw to hold the
cable in that position.&quot;
Proceedure for checking the thermostat is really bad in both books. They only
tell how big it gets when it's hot, not how small it gets when cold. I put mine
from a pot of boiling water into the freezer and observed no change in the
length; However, it measures up when hot, so I stuck 'er back in. At least until
winter  ;-)  When the engine reaches op temp, I always double check that the
flaps are open (*with* the spring) for peace of mind.

Bien Fortunado, Amigo
