&gt;Hey All,
&gt;
&gt;I've grown tired of the lack of power my aging 1600 sp is delivering
&gt;and would like to re-jet my 30/31 Solex. I live at relatively high
&gt;altitude (5,500 ft) that, combined with the less restricted flow of my
&gt;S&amp;S exhaust lead me to believe jumping up a notch or two might help.

You want to go down, not up.  I don't think your exhaust will make a
significant difference, but at that altitude I'd probably go down 2 sizes.
I don't know what the stock size is, but if it were 132.5, I'd go down to
127.5.  You're probably running way rich and that's why you don't have any
power.  Well, that and the elevation of course.

&gt;The problem is that I can't seem to locate any jets! Seems they aren't
&gt;available.

Vee parts in San Diego sells them... I finally forgot the phone number but
it should be in the archive, oh, I don't know, maybe 25 times (hint hint).

&gt;Someone on the list mentioned using Mikuni jets? What size would I
&gt;need and are there different styles of Mikuni jets, or are they all
&gt;the same?

There are different styles.  Best to take your old jet into a Yamaha or
similar type of motorcycle dealer and let them match it up.
