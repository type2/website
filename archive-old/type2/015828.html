Obviously your left bank is not firing.  Are you checking the exhaust temp
at idle?  If so, run the bus at 3500 RPM for a minute or so and then see
what the exhaust temp is.  The idle circuit might be bad on the left carb
which would cause the temperature differential at idle but both would be
hot at higher RPM since the main fuel circuit would kick in then.  This
would also explain the minimal loss in power.  My guess is a plugged idle
jet on the left carb.
