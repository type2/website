&gt; &gt; &gt; Im a valet driver and we have NEVER gotten a bus,

&gt; &gt;&gt;yeah, since my bus has hand controls in it, I just smile nicely at &gt;&gt;the
&gt; &gt;&gt;Valet and ask them if they have been certified to drive with hand
&gt; controls??
&gt; 
&gt; While I have not been 'certified' in any way, I have driven cars with hand
&gt; controls before.

there is no such certification that I'm aware of, trick question

&gt; Bring me your Bus and I'll take care of it.

however all hand controls don't work the same way, unlike cars with gas on
right, brake in the middle and clutch on the left, and all pushed
down.  there are several varients of hand controls...ask the poor valet at
the DC Shereton who took out the canopy, 3 cars and a limo, not to mention
sending two to the hospital when he mistook the gas for the brake :8*_at_

and while the Bug is very easy to put hand controls in, the bus is very
hard (manitory bus content)
