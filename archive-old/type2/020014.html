&gt; Btw, does any one *Nikki* have one of the rear Decklid Script &quot;Volkswagen&quot;
&gt; pieces for a 71 bus?  Please let me know, I have a buyer for two of them, as
&gt; well.

Hah! :-) I'll put them on my ever-larger list of things to look out for.
That 70 that benefited us so greatly was about the SECOND early bay I've
seen at the yards. It had that script on the back hatch, but I didn't
grab it because it was screwed on in about four places and I didn't
think it was worth snagging.

I haven't been junkyarding in over a month -- I'm going through severe
withdrawals! So you'll just have to settle for current inventory:
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~shrike3/parts/nixyard.html. Sowwy.

This is the big weekend for getting the engine (thanks, Don!) and trans
(thanks, Justin!) in the 69. The temporary registration runs out at the
end of the month. Yipes!

Can anyone tell me how the engine compartment seal(s) go in a 69? The
old ones were pretty much gone, and looked like three separate short
pieces at the back and sides. I just got new ones from Bus Depot and
they're two long bendy pieces (the &quot;firewall seal&quot; was backordered). I
have nothing to compare to.
