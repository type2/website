Dear Erik.

Noting your love affair with 1968-79 VW Type 2s in or from the Netherlands, 
I wonder whether you might have seen any fitted with one or more Zanetti 
twin-lens cab-door mirrors.

Back in 1988, I saw in Redhill, England, a left-hand drive 1973-79 VW Type 
2, fitted with these mirrors. I believe the van was imported into England, 
from either the Netherlands or West Germany.

I have recently been told that this type of mirror, was also commonly fitted 
to right-hand drive, Swiss post office vans.

The mirror which was patented by Zanetti GmbH, in Bern, Switzerland, has two 
convex mirror lenses, arranged at a pre-set relative angle, in a single 
housing. One lens gives the normal view to the rear, whilst the other 
enables one to view the rear-quarter blindspot.

The mirrors come complete with a stem and screw-fitting, to screw directly, 
into the pre-threaded holes, in the cab doors; completely replacing the 
standard, factory fitted mirrors.

I nwould like to obtain a pair of left-hand and right-hand Zanetti twin-lens 
mirrors, for my 1973 VW 1600 Type 2.

Regards.

                Nigel A. Skeet
