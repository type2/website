Subject: Re: [T2] removing campmobile equipment

&gt;I do know that certain parts must be removed before others can...
&gt;so... is there a link somewhere to the procedure?  Or does
&gt;someone perhaps have one off the top of their head - tips, etc?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;

Justin,
I just stripped the interior of a later bus. You need to remove the 
outside accessories like the propance connection going through the floor 
and the drain trap going through the floor. I would also take off all 
the outside utilities covers. Then remove the rear folding seat first. 
Then take out the Linen closet over the rear seat.
The bolts for these two are pretty obvious. Then remove the rear side 
cabinet with the pigeon holes and mirror. Be carefull of a wire that 
runs behind that cabinet towards the fridge. It goes to the power panel. 
Then take out the water tank,pull the wooden cover in compartment to the 
left of the fridge and remove those wires.
Every wire has a connector on it so no cutting is needed. Then the 
remove the fridge cabinet followed by the stove cabinet. You will have 
to remove the wooden
cover inside the bigger storage space under the sink to get to some of 
the screws. There is also a couple bolts behind the drivers side seat. 
Once all that stuff comes out remove the metal edging strips around the 
carpet and the carpet will come out. Be carefull of the insulation 
behind the cabinets. If a mouse got in there it will stink
and the stuff tends to break down a bit also. If you get stuck or can't 
find a bolt let me know.
