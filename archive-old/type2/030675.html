&gt; Greetings..
&gt; 
&gt; Quick question..
&gt; 
&gt; Should the vacuum hose that connects to the front of the vacuum advance on
&gt; the dizzy be connected to the vacuum port on the intake manifold (left) or
&gt; the vacuum port on the front of the carb (34pict 3).  The bus is a 71, 1600
&gt; dp.

Dual vacuum distributor, right?

The small outlet on the dist connects to the port on the SIDE of the carb,
drivers side.

The larger one connects to an equivilent sized port on the REAR (FIF!) of
the carb.

The ports are made to allow the correct vacuum conditions, when they are
needed...The intake port just gives full available vacuum at all times.

Good luck.
