&gt;much better but I don't know if he has an underdash or a overhead (not

I don't know how much better it really does.  The air coming out of the vents will typically max out at 35-40 degrees cooler than the outside air.  I have the overhead unit and one nice thing about it (other than the fact that it doesn't block access to under the dash, which is major) is that it blows the air directly down onto your head, where it will do the most good.  The drawbacks are that you have to duck more when you go from the front of the bus to the rear or vice versa, and the (significant) weight of the evaporater being so high up is not good for handling.  Still I would choose the overhead unit every time if I had the choice.

&gt;Both will probably reduce engine life
&gt;unless you turn em off going up hills under heavy load on a hot day (gee
&gt;aren't you glad you got it?) 

Or, you could just slow down a few mph and keep the air on.  Either way saves you the same couple of  horsepower.  I decided I would rather go 60 and be cool than 65 and sweat.  

The main reason that people recommend turning off the A/C when pulling hills is that in the typical water-cooled car, the A/C condensor is directly in front of the radiator, and all the heat that is shed from the A/C system goes right into the radiator, which can significantly reduce it's ability to cool the engine.  There is no such problem in a bus installation and the only issue remaining is the slight hp drain on the engine, which is easily compensated for by a slight modification of your driving style (i.e. slowing down a bit).
