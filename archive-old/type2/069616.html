&gt;Hi all
&gt;I took off my air cleaner to see exactly what carb I have on my '74 bus. It is
&gt;a Holly 
&gt;2bbl. So I wrote down the numbers on the little metal tag and called my local
&gt;parts 
&gt;store. They said it is a Holly number but they do not have a listing for it.
&gt;So I called 
&gt;3 other stores with the same response. So if any one can help here are the
&gt;numbers:
&gt;        R9677
&gt;        1482

This is likely a Holly bug spray?  Same carb is used on a Pinto I think.
