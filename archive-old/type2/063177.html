Subject: Lyin' Woman!!(was brake caliper rebuild)

OK
So I go down to the local O'Reily's to order my $28 caliper. 
When I get there and they write up the order it says $56 plus
a $10 core. I said polietly &quot;When I called a couple of days
ago the lady on the phone said it was $28 w/o a core charge...&quot;
        Kathy says &quot;Well that was me and I kinda remember the
conversation. Let me look......Oopps, looks like I was wrong.
Sorry, it will be $56 plus the $10 core..&quot;
        So I thanked her for time and left. I am not impressed
with a parts store that doesn't keep logs of what they tell people,
let alone one who won't cover their own admitted mistake. So 
I apologize to all the good people of this list that had their
hopes up (much like myself) of finding a sorce of inexpensive
calipers. 
I did get a reply from a fellow who got on for about $35. Whoever
you are I lost the address you gave me and I would appreciate it
if you could send it again. Thanks..........
