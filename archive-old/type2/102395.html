&gt; 1) Dropped valve seats on 3&amp;4 head

now this is interesting. That both the 3 &amp; 4 cyls went south, but you
made no mention of the 1 &amp; 2. This could be because of many things.
Such as it just happened to be a better head, or simply this head had
not built up enough heat heat to drop the valve seat. Either way be
sure you have the other head looked at (&amp; probably replaced if it took
that much of a punishment)

&gt; 2) They said that one of the air intake boots had slipped off and I was
&gt; getting unmeasured air into the system, causing the bus to run lean and hot.

very possible scenerio. A vacuum leak would do this.

&gt; 3) Didn't I notice that it was running hot or rough? Err, well it ran about
&gt; 220F on the freeway, and the only hint that things were rough was the
&gt; startup backfire and the stutter before it died.
&gt; 
&gt; So, was 220F too hot (oil temp measured with a sump sender)? Did this heat
&gt; cause the dropped valve seat or did I have a low quality head on there from
&gt; the rebuild?

I have run my bus for extended periods of time at much higher oil
temps than that. But then again my engine is very worn out (+230k
miles) &amp; to be honest I kinda wanted it to die, so I could justify the
cost of a rebuild (you guys w/ wifes understand this logic). It didn't
sound like you were on the road very long though. Remember the oil
temp is simply an indicator of the engine temp. But does react slowly
&amp; I use it simply for a general feel of the engine. Plus like someone
else mentioned, the oil temp should reflect some of what temp the
heads might be at, but it's not a direct measurement of that. Good
luck &amp; keep us informed. Was it a GEX?
