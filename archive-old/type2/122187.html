Subject: '72 NLA Elbow-Manifold Balance right side

I'm brilliant ! ! !

I need the '72 Elbow-Manifold Balance RIGHTside - NLA.  Anybody remember ? ? 
?

But why??

Because the RIGHT side elbow has a rubber protrusion where a tiny metal tube 
fits into, and the tiny metal tube connects with a 3.5mm vacuum line (for 
some obscure reason...)


OK, I don't really need the NLA elbow, what I really need is a connection 
for the tiny metal tube into the system, so it could be connected to the 
3.5mm vacuum line , which connects to something else, somewhere else.  
[Really, I don't know.  I am just dying to get this system back together.]


How about this, friends and family:  I drill a small hole in the right side 
of the balance pipe,fit in the tiny metal tube (etc) and solder it in , 
permanently.


Then I can use the Yes Currently Available (YCA) LEFT elbow on both sides of 
the balance pipe, and connect the 3.5mm vacuum to the balance pipe ! ! !


[Darn you, Dolan, why didn't you take that extra balance pipe from the 
'74!!!  You know better than to listen to me.  Although, you got to admit . 
. .  I'm   B R I L L I A N T  ! ! ! !]
