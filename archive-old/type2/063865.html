Subject: Salutations and a doublecab

A Hardy Hello to All,
I subscribed to this group last week, and then promptly left for a short
vacation. Was I ever floored to come  back to over 400 waiting
messages. Holy Smokes, what a workout, but I've made it through all of
'em. 

Well, as luck would have it, I have a fun volks related story to relate
from my vacation.  Nope, I didn't drive mine ('66 Sundial) but instead
got to ride around in a 99.999% original '67 doublecab with a whopping
total of 16,200  miles on it.  Nearly everything on it is as it was when
driven off the dealer's lot in late '66. I say 99.999% original because
the brake pads were replaced this spring for the first time.  The truck
and its owners (my friend's parents) live on an extremely small island in
NE Washington where the roads are all dirt, narrow and curvy. Consequently the
volks never sees speeds of more than then about 15mph - I'd guess that 3rd
gear has not been visited since the pickup was brought over from the
mainland.

At the same time, this is not a showroom vehicle mothballed for years by
some clarvoiant volks aficionado.  Rather, it is driven a few times a
week by the islanders to pack groceries and other supplies from the dock
up to the cabins on the island.  And while technically it is owned by my
friend's parents, its usage is truly communal.  The keys are always in it
as an open invitation for any of the residents to drive it when they need
to.  As I'm sure you all will agree, it would have been unconscionable for me
as a dyed in the wool VW lover to not ask about a sale.  But, I was not
particularly disappointed when I just got a grin for a response. If
there's ever a place  that seemed to mesh with what I believe is the
spirit of volkswagon ownership, this was it.  All the same, I could not
help but be a little envious of my friend's good fortune, who while
currently enduring the toxic surroundings of Houston and the buffeting of
the 9 to 5, could look forward to someday retiring to this place, complete
with a wooden boat to ply the waters and a double cab to roam the land.  

Happy driving
Damian
