&gt;In the center of the tank there is a small rubber 90 degree elbow which
&gt;connects to a vent line.  No one, not even the VW dealer seems to carry
&gt;this.
&gt;
&gt;Can I make one from regular fuel line just cut a little longer so it
&gt;does not kink?

There is a gadget that allows rubber hose to take a tight bend without
collapsing. It's just a coiled spring of the appropriate diameter (just
large enough for the hose to fit inside.) You can get them anywhere.
