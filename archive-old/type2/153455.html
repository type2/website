Subject: Re: [T2] VW bus inspired Chopper Bike for trade

    I'm sorry to say I don't have any $350.00 running engines laying around,
or $1000.00 plus camper interiors for trade.
    I do on the other hand have a well used 20 inch, banana seat bike, a
couple hub caps and nose emblem I can let you have for,        say $10.00
plus shipping. You may want to build up an inventory of these &quot;cool
looking&quot;, custom built, chopper inspired, VW bus/bug bikes in anticipation
of the crushing rush.
    Oh, by the way, what'll you take for the brick I see in one of the
pictures? I'm a sucker for odd collectibles.

Subject: [T2] VW bus inspired Chopper Bike for trade
&gt; (but there is definitely mandatory bus content).
&gt; Anyway, I am looking to trade this VW bus\bug inspired
&gt; custom built chopper bicycle for a running 1500 or
&gt; 1600 engine OR split bus camper interior.
&gt; It is cool and it is in Ohio,
