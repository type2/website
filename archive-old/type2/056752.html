$2000.00 firm. [1]


It's not a pretty bus, but it has a perfect poptop
canvas, a new (installed it myself in June) brazil/mex
engine, new 34 Solex Carb and fuel pump, new 875CCA 
DieHard, new exhaust, new 009.  Also comes with the
old (still good) singleport longblock, the intakes,
TWO 30 solex carbs, and anything else that's in my
garage.  Let's see, there's good front doors with 
glass, a VDO CHT gauge I never installed, and probably
a lot of little things I can't think of right now.
The sink has been yanked out years ago by a PO, which
suits me fine; I have enjoyed the space.  The table 
and the Zbed are there, as is the seat/toobox behind 
the driver.  blindspot closet and underbed cabinet are
there.  Radioshack AM/FM/Autoreverse Cassette
included, with speakers.  This bus is by no means rust free. 
It spent too long in Florida for that.  The rust is in the 
rockers, on the floors, on the smushed nose, around the
windshield.  Typical rust in the usual places.

Road tested (in JULY) on a trip from Texas to Arizona.

Does not run too hot even on 105 degree days, which
we have had for the past MONTH.  (I did feel
like I was pushing it on the 112 degree day).

I drive this bus to wrok and back every DAY, which is about
a 32 mile commute each way. 

The price is firm, because I have spent about $1900 on
mechanical stuff since May 98.  In 97 I had the balljoints
and tie rods installed (GERMAN parts installed by a GERMAN
mechanic!)  I put in a new canvas and cot, and 4 new tires.
Drove it to Oregon and back, and drove it daily for a year.
If the deal goes through, I'm getting a '94 15 passenger Dodge
Ram van, and frankly I am excited.  If I didn't live in a
cramped space with limited parking, I would keep the bus (and
the squareback, and the hyundai excel), but I can't get the
new van if I do.  I'm starting to have this &quot;thing&quot; for 
air conditioning and horsepower.

This vehicle is located in Garland Texas, on the far Eastern
side of Dallas, when at home, and located in Farmers Branch 
Texas, on the far Western side of Dallas when at wrok.
