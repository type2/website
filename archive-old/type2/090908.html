&gt; &gt; Well I've got to say that yes the buses have &quot;fragile&quot; handling at

&gt; I wonder how much of the 911 rear suspension could be adapted for the bus?

I really doubt that the Porsche suspension parts are stronger than the bus
parts.  When was the last time that someone loaded a ton of bricks in a
911?

911 transmission parts might be stronger, but not the suspension bits.

Porschebuses are certainly quick, but the prices and fragility of the
engine and trans scare me.  Of course, There are few alternatives if you
want a stronger 5spd transmission in a bus.  I researched the possibility
of flopping the ring gear on a subaru transmission, but it's no-go.  The case
on those things is asymmetrical, unlike the VW design they are based upon.
