&gt; To run either l-jet or d-jet (sorry, I don't know anything about j-jet)

The letters in front of the &quot;Jetronic&quot; (Bosch's electronic fuel injection
tradename) aren't sequential--there's no d-jet, e-jet, f-jet and so on. The
letter before Jetronic is a German word describing the FI system...

D-Jetronic: has Manifold Pressure Control. D stands for Druck, or Pressure.
It's controlled by vacuum and is completely analog.

K-Jetronic: K means Kontinu, or Continuous...the FI system squirts fuel into
the airstream all the time. It's regulated by an airflow meter. It is a
mechanically-controlled FI system. There's a little digital in here, but
analog too.

KE-Jetronic: same system as K-Jetronic, but with the addition of closed loop
electronic control.

L-Jetronic: L is for Luftmengenmessung, or Air Flow Management. Also an
AFM-regulated system, but the fuel is metered in pulses. This one's
electronically-controlled.

LH-Jetronic: the H is for Heiss, or hot; this is L-Jetronic with hot-
platinum-wire mass air sensor.

Motronic: This system is LH-Jetronic with integrated spark advance control.

Digifant: The page I saw about Digifant says it's VW's version of L-
Jetronic; he then gave a description of it and from that it sounds like a
version of Motronic.
