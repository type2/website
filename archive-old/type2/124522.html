Subject: two questions

You would be dealing with very toxic chlorine fumes. I once got a whiff when 
I entered a pump house and the boss had to get the ambulance up to me. It 
might not be a bad idea if you had safety properly cared for, but don't know 
how much it would help. You would better spend your time removing all the 
components and hand wiping them with bleach.

&gt; boil a pot of bleach with the car sealed up. The idea is for the resultant
fumes to eradicate the mildew. Would this be a very bad idea?  Seems
like it might be, but on the other hand, the stink is ungodly. Got any
other mildew cures that don't involve spending significant time inside
the car?
