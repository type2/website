The Type II bus sold in Mexico, which, most recently, had a water-cooled =
engine and a radiator on the front, cost about US $21,000 when I looked =
at one four years ago. It was manufactured in Brazil. VW de Mexico, =
unfortunately, no longer offers the Brazilian Type II bus, either in the =
water-cooled or air-cooled version. They now sell only the Eurovan, =
which comes from Germany, I think.

I imagine that there would be a healthy demand for gray market =
air-cooled Type II buses in Mexico now, as the Kombi is so popular down =
there as a collective taxi, delivery vehicle, etc. I don't know if =
they're available through the gray market there, though.

Any used vehicle in Mexico is expensive. The Mexicans drive them, patch =
em up and generally just drive them into the ground. If you were able to =
find a 25+ year old VW bus down there, it would probably be very =
expensive or completely worn out.

You can go there and buy a bus to drive there and sell. I did this in =
Italy=20
when I lived there. You can't bring it across the border and sell it =
here=20
if it is less than 25 years old.

They will make you sign some paperwork and possibly pay a deposit to =
bring=20
it across the border.

If you don't get it south of the border before a certain date you lose =
your=20
money and they come looking for you.

As I understand it - anything 25 years+ old can come across the border =
now.

&gt;Howdy folks.
&gt;My girlfriend and i are talking about driving around mexico someday in =
a=20
&gt;bus, but instead of bringing mine all the way down (not as far as for=20
&gt;some, we're in New Orleans) we were wondering if it were feasable to =
buy=20
&gt;one there, drive it around, then sell it there. Any idea what busses go =

&gt;for down there? Comparative prices to here? Cheaper? More expensive? If =
a=20
&gt;new Brazilian is $8000 then maybe a 30 year old used in Mexico might be =

&gt;cheap? Any legal issues involved?

Ciao!
