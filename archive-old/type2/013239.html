Minor tidbit of Riviera trivia,

Named after the Volks dealer in Hillsboro, OR that
commisioned ASI of Vancouver to do the work.  ASI is
still in business doing other things now.  They are
built on a standard bus chassis which I have been told
is not the case with Westy.  

Appearently the Westy is done of of a sturdier
platform (anyone out there who knows more about this,
please shed some light).

Follow this link, if your bus looks like this odds on
its an ASI Riviera.

&gt; hey  a westy is a camper that has been converted by

&gt; If your camper pops straight up it could be a
&gt; Riviera conversion. You say it
&gt; still has all the seats. You mean like a passenger
&gt; bus? If you have
&gt; passenger seats AND a pop top you have bought
&gt; something somebody has
&gt; converted one way or the other.
&gt; Type 4 describes the engine you have in your bus
&gt; stock, also known as the
&gt; pancake engine.Go to my website to see lots of
&gt; different Baywindow
&gt; (68-79)campers www.72camper_dot_com  and interiors. Also
&gt; its probably a good
&gt; idea to just plunge into the type2_dot_com website and
&gt; look up westfalia and
&gt; riviera to see the differences.
&gt; In addition a weekender is commonly known as a bus
&gt; that doesn't have a pop
&gt; top, but does have a camper interior. Unless Riviera
&gt; called their bus the
&gt; weekender and I don't know about it.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know I will get a lot of flack for this but I
&gt; need to know what the
&gt; &gt; definition of &quot;westy&quot; is?  I have a 78'
&gt; &quot;Weekender&quot;, that is the straight
&gt; up
&gt; &gt; camper top, not the slanted, and has all the seats
&gt; still.  Is that
&gt; &gt; considered a &quot;westy&quot;.  You see I am new to the bus
&gt; thing.  I have owned
&gt; bug
&gt; &gt; all my life and am really good with a type 1 motor
&gt; but not so good with a
&gt; &gt; type 2.  Also what is considered a type 4?
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the help,
&gt; &gt; Larry Morris
