Would anyone have any secret tips on pulling the &amp;!*_at_&amp; gas peddle
cable  through the pipe.  It seems to hang up at the slight curve in the
front  of the tranny.  &lt;FIF&gt;  This is in ref to a 72 westy.  Thanks all!

I did mine on my 71, which might be slightly different that than 72, but the
concept is the same... I basicallt took a long piece of heavy duty string
and tied it to the end the cable in the back of the bus... I then pulled the
old cable out from the front, with the heavy duty string following it... once
I had the old one out and the string threaded through, I attached the string
to the new cable, and had a friend start pulling the string through with
the new cabel from the back, while I was in the front greasing the cable
as it went through... It got stuck a couple of times, but if you play with it
long enough it'll slide through...
