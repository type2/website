Subject: Horn Re-Wiring

Hello All,
I am going to take you up on the fact that there are no silly questions.  I
am attempting to get the horn to work.  I have Bentley, I see where the
wires are supposed to be, I know the colors, and I have traced my current
wiring.  Here is what I have found..under the horn cap (on wheel) the brown
wire was broken and not connected to anything.  I see the little hole
connecter on the plastic horn insert, so I attempted to splice a wire and
connect.  Nothing.  I traced the wire from the horn, and appears PO has run
an entire new (old) wire.  I removed the belly pan (I think this is what
it's called) and traced the wire up to behind the kick panel.  Removed
panel, and the wire stops, corroded and broke.  Now you would think that a
remaining piece would be hanging form the fuse area...no.  So now I am
gently yanking wires..Not good.  So Now I am asking..
To rewire from scratch, where would or how would one connect the wire to the
third fuse from the right?  It didn't appear, and is certainly daunting to
me, to mess with extracting the fuse panel.  I need to know how to or where
to connect.  And as far as the ground, how does it connect at the wheel?
Bentley says the brown connects to the wheel plastic insert and then there
is a ground that runs from there.
Thanx for you patience.
