Joel, please change the stats!

I just picked up another Westy.  This time, a '59.

This bus is wonderful.  Been garaged much of its life (I know the last two 
owners), so there's far less rust than you'd expect.  Side panels are fine, 
for example - only problem areas are near the doors.  She needs some work 
of course, but this is one dignified lady.  Ready for resto (gawd, I hope I 
can afford it).

I should have some pix up soon on my website,

Good thing about this purchase is, the guy almost sold it to a recycler.  I 
don't know if it would have been parted out or not, but too scary to 
contemplate.  Another piece of 'Precious Metal' saved!!!

Doing my part to 'keep 'em running',

Ken
