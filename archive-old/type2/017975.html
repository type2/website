Subject: Honeymoon tips? (1st bus, what do I do now?)

After 20 years of pent-up desire I made an offer on a '74 Westfalia in
mostly pretty good condition. Now I'm afraid. It's such a strange beast.
I don't know what to do with it when I get it home. I'm shy, timid and
afraid.

Do any of you have a checklist or routine that you generally follow with
a new bus?

My immediate concerns are:

1. Fuel rubber (looked good on first inspection.)

2. Brakes are stiff &amp; not terribly &quot;stoppy&quot;

3. Steering is a little loose and wandery

How do the rest of you go about breaking in a new bus?
