Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic clutch

&gt;
&gt;Has anyone installed a hydraulic clutch in their Baywindow?
&gt;


Hi Chris(and list)

I've been wanting to do the same thing, but the only hydraulic setups I have 
seen that are adaptable to the VW transmission(easily anyway) are sandrail 
setups.  I too would like to know of anyone who has tackled this one.

	Eron
