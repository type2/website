Subject: help... baaadd exhaust smell
Message-Id: &lt;199904302315.QAA13233_at_coopext_dot_cahe.wsu_dot_edu&gt;

Hey!
Need help!  I am getting gas and exhaust smell inside my 70 westy bus.  I
recently adjusted ... or tried to, the automatic (?) choke on the right
side of the carb.  Can anyone give me advice as to where the choke is
supposed to be positioned, and how to adjust the card?
Thanks!
