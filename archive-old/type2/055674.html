Subject: '59 panel, a few more questions...

First, many thanks to those who helped me by answering some
of my questions last week!

This evening, I've been driving the '59 around a bit more
since I finally got the title transferred and the insurance
on it.  And more questions keep coming to mind.

First, I notice that I can shift into reverse without pushing
down on the shift knob.  In my '66, I can't shift into reverse
unless I press down while shifting.  Is this a difference with
the older model or is something broken?  If it is broken, how
is it fixed?  There also seems to be a bit longer throw to the
shifts on the older bus.  I just attribute this to worn out
linkage but perhaps the linkage is a bit different on the older
busses?

Second, my headlights don't seem very bright.  I've always heard
stories about how 6 Volt vehicles have dim headlights but now
that I'm experienceing it for myself, I'm wondering if this is
a bug or a feature, that is, is this the way it was when the 
vehicle was new or is there something wrong that I can fix?  I
suspect that cleaning all the electrical connections might help
as might running a couple new wires from the battery to the
front of the bus.  Any wisdom from 6 Volt bus owners out there?

Many more thanks,

 -Dyer
