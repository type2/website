Subject: Re: [T2] Argggh!..what did I miss?

&gt; I must have missed something in the discussion about this
switchover from 78 to 72-74, cause I got down to test fitting
my new powder coated heat exchangers and my 78 control box
and tubes....WUPS! 
 The 72-74 heater boxes holes are *round* and the control box
tubes that are supposed to fit on them are *oval*. 
 I don't remember anyone saying before that they didn't fit...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You missed that part in the long lists of pieces needed I always send when this 
switch comes up :-)

The 72-74 and 79 tubes are round. You will need a pair. 

(I have them.......)
