Subject: Looking for Mitchell Flat rate manual for VW

Volks,
Hopefully there is an old shop owner on the list that either has one, and=
 or knows where to get one.........

My friend/local vw shop owner has a manual printed in 1978 by Mitchell Ma=
nuals Inc called the Glenn Mitchell Flat Rate Manual........what it does =
is tells you the amount of labor to charge for certain jobs........engine=
 pull, brakes, etc.......It also has a parts breakdown!  He lucked into i=
t about 15 years ago and lives by it for billing.  =20

Please pmail with any sources.
