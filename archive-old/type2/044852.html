This is so sad, and this young woman had her whole life in front of her. I
hope they catch the bastards and punish them severely..

Keep the faith.

Me too.
I use to sleep at this rest stop on occasion.
My God, I wish I had known this girl.
I would have suggested a very close by place that is so much safer than

I feel sick to my stomach.
