Subject: Re: [T2] re:oil cooler

Actually I was wrong, the temp was 235-240 max. with cruising speeds on the
flats around 220. Sorry about that. this is with a sensor mounted in the
drain plug. And yes, this is much better than the 245-255 I was getting on
hot days with out the  cooler!!

&gt; &gt;I bought the largest cooler from bus boys and have had great success with
it.
&gt; &gt;I mounted it underneath my 79 and temps have not gone over 245-250 even
on
&gt; &gt;90 degree plus days!!!

&gt; Well, I guess that is what I am wanting in the way of feedback,
&gt; So, let me ask .. Is your temp of 245-250 acceptable ?
&gt;
&gt; My temp., if the Berg dipstick therm is calibrated, would have been right
&gt; around the 230 degree mark yesterday.
