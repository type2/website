Subject: bad news

Well, I found my problem.  Evidently, one of the heads blew a stud out underneath on the passenger side.  I can see fire there.  Guess that means an engine drop and a trip to the machine shop.  I'm not sure I can do it by myself.  And my VW shop is out of business.  Plus, I'm covered up with school, tax jobs, etc.  Couldn't have happened at a worse time.  Doesn't look like I'll make EB this year either.  Bummer.  I'm going to look at it again and see if there's anyway I could re-tap it and replace the stud.  But I'm not optimistic.  WAAAAH!  I'm really sick over it.  Does anybody know where to get one of those VW transmission brackets as shown in Bentley?  That'd be a lot easier than having a separate jack under the tranny.  Cheers...KR
