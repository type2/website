Subject: Re: [T2] AVP problems

&gt; &gt; I am going to
&gt; &gt; loosten the pully from the fan and see if I may have gotten it off to 
&gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; side by 1 or 2 hundreths when I put it back on the fan.
&gt; &gt; Have you ever heard of this problem?
&gt;
&gt; No. I've heard of it but when I pressed the person to tell me how he
&gt; resolved it he never replied. I'll ask again.
&gt;
I pulled the hub and found dimples on the crank shaft on both sides of the 
key that positions the hub. Looks like someone used a punch to remove the 
key from the crank and missed twice. there is raised metal about 1/100 of an 
inch but I'll bet that's enough to pue the outside edge of the fan off 
kilter enough to scrape the housing. tried to scrape the metal off with a 
knife blade but I hardly got a sliver off. Getting too cold outside so I'll 
try again later. Maybe some emery cloth after I pack the seal with paper 
towel or something. Any Ideas on how to remove the pimple of steel?

&gt; Be very carefully with the bolts that hold the fan to the pulley. The 
&gt; heads
&gt; strip easily and there is no part number for them because the whole 
&gt; assembly
&gt; was sold as one unit.

This one uses regular bolts to hold the fan on the hub. I know the earlier 
ones used some kind of allen head bolt. I think my 75 uses the allen head 
bolts. May have been weaker.
&gt;
&gt; There is also no torque listed for those bolts so you can strip the 
&gt; threads
&gt; as well. I would go no higher than 11 ft. lbs. Then recheck it after a few
&gt; hundred miles.
&gt;
The Bentley for the 80 Vanagon says to torque them to 14 ft. lbs.
