Subject: intake valve stuck closed? (was rough idle, shaking whole bus)

did some tinkering.  pulled off the rocker arms of # 1 and everything looked
fine.  pulled intake pushrod to see if maybe it was what was causing the
1/4&quot; play.  looked fine.  had my son turn the starter while i watched the #
1 valves and rockers.  when the turning stopped i checked the intake vavle
again.  it was closed and tight.  did whole thing again.  stopped the turns
when intake was opened.  1/4&quot; play again.  so it would seem the intake valve
is stuck closed.  meaning it will not open.  good.  one more puzzle piece.
ever put a puzzle together and not have the box lid?  oh, yeah,  put the
compression tester on # 1 again while running starter.  still no compression
and no sound of air escaping from the cylinder or valves.
anyway, thanks for listening, everyone.
