Subject: [T2] More parts for sale

I actually went out to my garage the other night and took an inventory
of the stuff I've been rescuing from the junkyards this year. Holy
Guacamole! How'd I get so much stuff?! So, here it is:

The lenses are bundled with the bulbholders, and priced accordingly. We
can talk about breaking up the sets and repricing.

Art Lynch already has dibs on the bay rear center tin.

Help me afford an engine! :-) And keep your li'l tootsies warm this
winter, and pass safety inspections, and all that.

I'll be adding pictures and a Freebies section RSN (real soon now -- nod
to Ric).

(still scratching my head at how much STUFF there is!)
