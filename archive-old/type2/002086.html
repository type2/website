Volks,
  Here is what I have '79 2.0L FI with CALIF Emissions.

  I have a two part question: First does the Dizzy have a gasket/seal to the
case? (I think I am leaking oil around the shaft of the dizzy).

Second:
  If a seal/gasket does happen to be there, what is the sure fire way to
remove a dizzy. I have never pulled a dizzy so please make the procedure a
simple as possible.  I read the bently manuall and I think I can do it. Any
information will be greatly appreciated.

TIA
