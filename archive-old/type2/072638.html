Hope this hasn't been beaten to death, but here goes:

It concerns the oil deflector plate which fits under the generator support.
My reading of Bentley says the following:

1.  the vanes go down into the block.

2.  standing at the rear of the engine on the left hand side near cylinders
#3 &amp; 4, one can see through the openings of the vanes.  Then, standing at
the rear on the right hand side:  one cannot.

Does this jibe with everyones' understanding?
