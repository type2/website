Someone wrote to ask who rebuilt my engine in Dallas.  I have lost the letter
so I am sending it to the list for everyone's information.  Contact: Knight's
Machine Shop at 972-271-3643.

For the person that wrote about air conditioning, contact: Cooler Air,
972-771-3791.  I haven't had mine done yet, but I understand he has a unit
that only draws 1/2 hp.
