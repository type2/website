Subject: Re: &lt;FMBC&gt; Buses By The Falls 2002 Pictures

Greg,

Those are really fantastic pictures. It looks like Jamie and rest of 
you fellows put on a wonderful event!!!!! I was struck by the fact 
that there were not any crappy looking buses. Seriously I have never 
been to an event where at least 3 out 7 buses (usually including mine 
:) should be at least brush painted before they are allow to leave 
the house.

Thanks for the great pics!
