&gt; So, essentially, you're paying twice as much, or more than 3 times as

or take that money and invest it in a CDI unit like like the Mallory 
Hyfire VI. I use a pertronix unit to trigger this cdi and it's pretty 
nice. I have been messing with my carbs so my mileage isn't the most 
consistent, however I saw approx 1mpg increase on the install and 
greater sparkplug gap. Not a lot given the expense of the unit........

HOWEVER! I have never had a VW that idled as well as my bus does 
currently. It has made cold starts easier and the idle (when my carbs 
are set correctly and I'm not messing with them) rock solid.

One thing that many of the crane supporters have to say is that they 
were let down by some of the Pertronix and Compufire point replacement 
modules, but had no problem with the Crane. Sometimes it's better to pay 
more for a solid device. I will say that I have a pertronix in 3 vw's 
and I have not had a single problem from them.
