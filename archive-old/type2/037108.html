Dear Jim O'Reilly in Chichester UK,

Sorry to say this, but........

Some years ago, I helped a younger guy with an autobody shop startup.
We worked on a number of homebrew paint jobs, until we had enough good
business to turn them away.  In every case, it was necessary to remove
all the old crap, so we could paint over a sound surface...... meaning
it cost the owners far more than if they had just left their cars
alone.

My best advice for you is:  Brush some grease over the areas that are
in danger of rusting through..... and save your money for a
professional job ASAP.  You will thank yourself in the long run, and
if you sell the vehicle, the payback will be evident.  No
knowledgeable buyer wants to buy a halfass paint job....  IMHO+FWIW.
