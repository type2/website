What it was (for me) was the plug for the double relay that powers the FI 
stuff (on the front firewall left on the top) was worn, and wiggled... 
apparently, when it got warm, it loosened *just* enough to make and break 
contact.  Didn't find it until one day when it wouldn't run at all, and spent 
a day looking until I found this ittle surprise.  Tied it up and in place 
with, believe it or not, string around the relays and plugs... and no more 
problems.  I have wondered why since then that VW positioned the double relay 
plug down - maybe they thought the plugs would never fail or something!
