but be sure to remove the linkage bracket on an automatic before doing
this.

   on an automatic you don't need the clearance that a manual needs (no
long tranny shaft to clear the clutch plate) so I always recommend on an
auto to leave the tranny alone and just drop the engine

&gt; &gt; Tom,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What Karl suggests is SOP on the Vanagon engine removal.  I have not tried
&gt; &gt; it on a bay, but I see no reason it would not work.  One thing on the bay,
&gt; &gt; though... do remove the shift rod from the nose of the trans before you
&gt; &gt; swing the trans down!  If you don't, it will really bind on you! You also
&gt; &gt; need to support the bell housing lest it fall on the floor.  A couple 2x4s
&gt; &gt; should do it.
