 But I was just
&gt; curious though what
&gt; the top speed of my 1973 Bus supposedly is. I don't
&gt; want to know because
&gt; I want to go that fast, but I'd really like to know
&gt; what the fastest
&gt; speed I can SAFELY, and RELIABLY go. I mean, what
&gt; would be the fastest
&gt; speed I can cruise at while not overheating my Bus,
&gt; and keeping the RPMs
&gt; within a safe speed?  Lets assume of course, that I
&gt; have a completely new
&gt; suspension, and perfect tires (which I don't, but I
&gt; will soon).

I think that VW usually said that cruising speed=top
speed or close to it, in the owner's manuals.
You should be able to cruise all day at 70mph if the
bus was in all-around good shape, with a top end near
80, if I remember okay.  My 75 with a 79 FI engine
does fine at 70+, keeping up with the flow of traffic
on the local interstate hiway. And 70 is fast enough
for me, although she will go faster if I ask.

Jim, in Menomonie, WI, 
(thinking about bodywork and paint for the 75, who
looks kind of shabby sitting next to the 65 double
cab, all shiny and white.)
