Subject: Re: [T2] push start

Hi Volks,

The AFM flap also triggers the fuel pump.

As soon as the clutch comes out and the engine turns over the afm is 
going to be pulled open and that will start the fuel pump. It might 
take an extra revolution or two to get pressure, but that's not really 
all that long, is it? And then....Vroom!! Away you go.

Unless your bus has an automatic transmission. In that case you'll want 
to be sure to carry a set of jumper cables.

Happy trails,

&gt; I've push-started my FI bus all the time, on dead batteries, too. 
&gt; Unless you have a leaky injector, the system will still maintain 
&gt; pressure for at least a half-hour, if not more
