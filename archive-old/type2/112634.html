&gt; &gt;The third weekend in May there are a couple things happening down in the
&gt; &gt;Oxnard/Ventura area that might make interesting side trips on a camping
&gt; &gt;trip. There are at least 3 state parks nearby (on the ocean) to choose
&gt; &gt;from and that weekend - May 16-18 - there is the Strawberry Festival and
&gt; &gt;the Karmann Ghia Treffen, depending on your tastes. Can I have a show of
&gt; &gt;hands of any that would be interested in making the trip?
&gt;
&gt; Ventura, CA or Ventura, GA or Ventura, MA?

&gt; Inquiring minds want to know! &lt;grin&gt;

Go figure?! Are the ones in the East on the coast? One of these days I'm
going to make a cross country trip and visit those places but for now the
Ventura in this instance is between L.A. and Santa Barbara looking out on the
Channel Islands.
