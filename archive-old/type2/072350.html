Subject: Wheels and tires

I searched the archives, but could not find an answer to this question:

I have a '76 Westy with thick spoke steel wheels.

I went to buy new tires this morning and the salesman at Discount 
would not work on my wheels. He said they are &quot;Jackman&quot; wheels and 
are flat not dished at the hub contact. The dish acts as as a spring 
when tightening the lug nuts and helps keep the wheel from falling 
off.

Is he:

1. Telling the truth?

2. Full of it?

3. Just trying to sell me new wheels/rims?

Thanks.
