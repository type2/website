Subject: Re: [T2] belly pans.... (bolted or welded?)

Hi Chris,

&gt; FWIW, my 73 model 235 (no heater) has no holes (28?
&gt; wow) or welds for a pan.  Never had a pan though I 
&gt; guess it was supposed to.   
&gt; hhhhmmmm.....

Well, the fiche isn't 100% free of errors I must admit
;-)

Type 235 is a Kombi with slidingroof, right?
So you had the outside pans but not the one in the
middle?

Interesting. So either in 1972 or 1973 they cancelled
the middle underfloor pan for slidingroof
buses...anyone else who can prove this to be wrong or
can tell me something about the 1972 slidingroof
buses?
