&gt;1) I'm a little concerned that what is potentially the

&gt;#3 gets the hottest (hence is the site for the FI CHT
&gt;sensor) - so why did #2 fail and not #3 or #1?

#3 because of it's placement is sightly hotter than the other 3 cylinders. When there is a mechanical, ignition, FI etc failure any of the cylinders can go.

&gt;Serendipity, or shoudl I suspect something more
&gt;sinister?

You need to find out what fried your head so you don't fry another one.

&gt;2) I don't have a CHT sensor gauge, but do have a VDO
&gt;oil-temp gauge fitted. Now I know these are nowhere
&gt;near as good as CHT gauges, but a CHT gauge just isn't
&gt;going to happen before we go on vacation, so can
&gt;anyone tell me roughly at what oil temperature I
&gt;should be worrying/slowing down, to avooid this
&gt;happening again? The sensor is currently in the sump
&gt;drain plug hole.

It really doesn't matter. You can have perfect oil temps and be frying the head while you drive.
