&gt;   After a year and a half of reading posts, I've yet to hear this one.
&gt; The other day, as I was about to pull out into the street, I heard the
&gt; loud *bang*.  Not knowing what it was, I cut the engine, pushed her back
&gt; out of the road, and crawled underneath.  Well, what happened?  Four of
&gt; the bolts holding my CV joint in had worked their merry way out and the
&gt; remaining two were sheered off.  I'm off to replace the bolts tomorrow
&gt; and hope no further damage was done.

Same thing happened to me a couple months ago. they gave me a little more
warning than you got. Two of my bolts had busted off in the hub and I had to
re-thread the holes and file the flange down a bit (all that banging around
dented it up a bit). Since then I check the torque on the bolts at every oil
change/tune up. This was the first bad thing to happen to my van and the
inspiration for it's name :)
