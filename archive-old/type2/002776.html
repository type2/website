Hey all,
I'm putting together a web page for my EveryBus pics and I want to link to
other photo albums out there.  Dave Jersey, I've already got the link to
your photo album.  Anybody else who's got pics up, give me a URL and I will
link to my page.

Likewise, trip reports.  I know some good ones already got posted to the
list and for some reason I have already deleted them.  Whoops.  Those who
have posted trip reports, if you'd like them to be displayed on my site,
please e-mail them to me (scour that Sent folder) and those who haven't
posted yet, you may get an e-mail from me after you post requesting
permission to put your trip report on my site, with all due credit of
course.

Thanks!
