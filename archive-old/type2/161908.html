&gt; Not to hijack a thread, but is anyone out there willing to sell a
&gt; functioning thermostat for a 78 2.0?  I have about 400 miles on a complete
&gt; rebuild but had to leave my flaps open as well since I could not find a
&gt; thermostat.  With the weather we're seeing in the Denver area, I'm lucky to
&gt; see much of anything register on my oil temp gauge whenever I drive her.

We have NOS thermostats in stock. These are type 1 thermostats, but they are
the late ones for FI Beetles, so the temp range is almost a perfect match
for the type 4 stat.

We only have a few of these left and may not be able to get any more once
they are sold. They are NOS Walhler in the blue and red box. There is a tech
article linked in the product listing on how to install this in a type 4
vehicle, very simple to do.
