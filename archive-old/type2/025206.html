&gt;Looking for any and all info on swapping to a Type I engine on my 74 bus.
&gt;A website or something like that would be great. Any info on what needs
&gt;to be done, fabricating tin, engine mounting, clutch, tranny etc....

a type I engine was an option in Europe for late model buses.  occasionally
a set tin and flywheel from one of these of comes up for sale.  I have seen
sets for under $300 a couple of times.

I am curious as to why you would want to do a conversion backwards?  The
type IV engine is better in almost every way.  It is a little more complex
to work on and the parts are more expensive, but in my opinion the power,
reliability and better engineering is worth it.  The 74 engine isn't the
best type IV.  if you were to do a conversion put a 78 engine in.  The 78
engine is fuel injected and hydraulic.  I did this on my 72 double slider
because I was tired of working on it.  Since the conversion I haven't done
anything but change the oil and plugs, that was over 20K ago.  Anyway, that
is enough from me...
