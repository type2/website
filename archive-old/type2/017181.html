&gt; I'm a bit of an electronic numbskull so I thought I'd approach the brain

&gt; fuel pump that feeds dual PDSIT carbs.
&gt;
&gt; How do I rig a home made double relay so that the fuel pump only gets
&gt; current when the starter motor is running or when the engine is running?

Once suggestion is to use a fuel pump relay from a Rabitt or Jetta with CIS fuel
injection.  That relay has a terminal that connects to the wire that goes from
the points to the coil and as long as your points are closing once per second,
the relay will stay on.  The relay has the timing circuit built inside of the
package.  You can pick up one of the relays out of a junk yard for a couple of
dollars and experiment with it before you take the plunge and hook it up to the
bus.
