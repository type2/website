Subject: RE: Temp Gauge

Good point!  Another thing to consider is just what happens in modern water
cooled engine.  The cooling system has a pressure control cap somewhere
along the way, often on top of the radiator.  In the past, these vented at
14 psi, but I think that may be higher now.  Operating at pressures above
atmospheric allows for a higher boiling temperature, and thus a higher (then
212 deg F) engine operating temperature, which is desirable in terms of
efficiency and fuel economy, and allows for smaller cooling system
components.  With that in mind, I have to believe that modern oils, dyno or
synth, have kept pace with engine temperature requirements.  So my thinking
is to use good quality oil, change it often, and then not worry about it too
much.

Way too low to burn off the water vapors in the oil!  Gotta get over 212
for that.
