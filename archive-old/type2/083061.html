&gt; Hey Karl,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the reply.  I originally wrote this for my
&gt; subaru forum, hence the dodging of the real isuue.
&gt; Which is the impending head job, lack of power,
&gt; obsolete motor, propensity for overheating, dropped
&gt; valves, etc.
&gt;
&gt; I have had to repair solder joints in the ECU already
&gt; too. and my air sensor is gonna go any day.
&gt;
&gt; I know e-81's; they are bulletproof, easy to work on,
&gt; strong, and all around a good motor.  And, I have
&gt; plenty as I have been an older subaru freak for
&gt; several years.
&gt;
&gt; Oh Yeah, they also use ea-81's in experimental
&gt; aircraft, you won't see our beloved type 4 in those.

Actually, you will.  See:

&gt; The Kennedy adpator is about $500, and radiator
&gt; routing hoses will put me back another $150.  A custom
&gt; radiator (to fit in a fake spare tire looking thing)
&gt; would set me back about $500 too.  I am sure there are
&gt; several other incidentals, but worth it in my opinion.

The Subaru seems to be the most compatible of conversions, but if I were
going to all that trouble I'd want a later, more powerful version.  Of
course, those aren't so easy to adapt to a baywindow.

I've seen a couple of conversions where the radiator is located in the
left engine bay, drawing air from the left air intake and exhausting it
through the gaps around the engine (no more engine bay seal)  I've also
seen a conversion done with the radiator replacing the engine bay door,
but that one had cooling problems, probably due to lack of shrouding
around the radiator to prevent recirculation.

The ideal seems to be to get a waterboxer vanagon, as it is already set
up for water and can often be bought for a song with a blown engine.
