Subject: Dave Eccles at Venlo, and the oldest van ?

Dave
we must have slipped by each other a number of times. Sarah and Damon
mentioned your name a few times, but I don't think we spoke. I had the
mango green, sea gull grey van on the upper lot across from the ambulance,
next to Sarah.
Sorry but I can't make it next summer. We'll be back in Bolivia the rest of
the year.

&gt;So...where in the world is the oldest surviving still functioning privately
&gt;owned Bus..anyone wanna nominate something for starters?
&gt;Alternatively..where is the oldest bus even if its a wreck!!

Dave
A couple of weeks ago I went to pick up some parts from Tony Larsen. In his
shop he had his 1953 221 recieving a new front beam, and next to it his
1950 type II transporter, vin number 01880,  under way. This vechile is in
the most amazing shape, yet nevertheless Tony is doing it all and doing it
right. By the way this is loaded with parts numbers beinging with 29 xxx
