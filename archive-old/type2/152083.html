&gt; &gt; with my 78 the seats were beyond bad, so when a nice set of Vanagon seats
&gt; &gt; became avaliable at a great price I grabbed em, haven't regretted it,
&gt;
&gt; Which year vanagon seats fit my 78?  I see some with armrests that look
&gt; like they would get in the way of the fresh air distribution system on
&gt; the door.

not sure what years are interchangeable....something like 75-83 or so
armrests had to be removed, just a single bolt.
