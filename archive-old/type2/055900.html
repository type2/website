&lt;&lt; Not knowing the functions of  the key, lock cylinder,  and the
 electrical switch , I purchased all three.  You should buy only the
 electrical switch and not the lock cylinder.  It is hard for me to imagine
 a malfunction that would necessitate replacing the cylinder. &gt;&gt;

To All,

The conditions which wear out the cylinder (and the key!) typically involve
hanging objects from your key-ring.  Normal motion of the vehicle is
sufficient to cause the mass of the key-ring, acting thru the lever of the
key, to destroy the cylinder rather quickly.

My own case was a bit extreme in that, along with several vehicle's-worth of
keys, my key-ring also included a brass snap-swivel, a small Cresent wrench,
multi-purpose screwdriver and a pen-knife.  My key-rings now consist of one or
two keys and a ring :-)

PS -- For all you non-sailors out there, the snap-swivel is used to attach
your keys to your belt. -- rsh
