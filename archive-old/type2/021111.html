&gt; Volks,
&gt; Haven't gotten it to fire yet, but that is because the battery is weak...
&gt; this bus has been sitting for a looong time.... it didn't run well for quite
&gt; a while, and I pulled the original engine before Christmas.... so the battery
&gt; is on a charger at the moment.
&gt;
&gt; .... also, with full float chambers, it should catch and spin up the
&gt; Alternator quick enough that the low voltage won't be a problem.  At least
&gt; that is the hope.

Dave:
I think you may have missed something here. You can't put ANYTHING on the #1
(connection except a tach trigger maybe), excep the wire from the condenser.
Certainly not a load. You'll have no spark.
The reason VW uses a DOUBLE relay on the FI is to supply power under 2
conditions: 1.Crank and 2.Run
You'll have to get some way to run the pump while cranking.
Old time Stewart -Warner  electric fuel pumps came with a diagram to trigger the
run condition from an oil pressure switch. This always seemed like a good idea to
me.
Also, you should run an inline fuse before the relay. 30A would be okay.
