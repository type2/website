Does anybody out there in the entire world have a bus with a Weber 32/36
that really does run *CORRECTLY*?

Thanks again list,

   John,

 I must admit that I had the same problems as you are having now. I run the
Weber 32/36 and a Bosh 009 on my 1776 type1 engine. Are you using heat
risers for the manifold tubes? If not, this is what happens:
The manifold vacuum has the effect of cooling the gas/air mixture down even
below freezing temperature. This can happen even on a hot day. The phenomen
can sometimes be seen as water drops or even ice formations on the
manifold. When the gas/air mixture is getting too cold and the speed of the
mixture in the manifold tubes is low the gasoline is separating from the
air and form drops on the walls of the tubes. For a while the cylinders are
only getting air with some big gasoline drops, not a good gas/air mixture.
That´s when the engine seems to gasp for air or fuel. The longer and bigger
the manifold tubes are the bigger the problem gets. 

The cure is a heated manifold.VW has allways used heat from the exhaust
sytem. A thin tube from the #2 cylinder exhaust port is routed along the
manifold tube(s) and then into the muffler. 

Here´s a few different solutions:

1, If you have heat risers already they can be blocked with carbon. If so,
just try to clean them with a piece of wire.

2, My solution was an electric heater system made of heating wire from an
electric seat heater.

3, Try to heat the air before the carb. I don´t know about the type4 engine
but the type1 has a heater tube from behind the 1 and 2 cylinders to the
air filter.
