Subject: bus mufflers - type 1

Hey all,
When I got Opie ('68 crew cab) a little over a year ago, I replaced the
muffler with a JCW special.  Not knowing any different, it was a Kadron
sedan muffler, i.e. from Brazil.  I know now that the bus used a different
muffler on the 'loafs, having a single output exiting to the left rear
corner of the bumper.

The cheap muffler has not lasted.  Not even a year.  It is driven over 70
miles a day, and garaged at night.  I noticed it starting to get louder a
couple months ago, but didn't think much of it.  When I finally got under
it, the inside baffle had broken loose and actually worn through the bottom
of the muffler.  I welded that up, and then holes just started appearing on
the top, and bottom of the muffler.  Junk.

So, now I'm going to buy a new muffler.  This time not the cheap special.

Here's the question.  What differences in noise and performance are there
between the sedan mufflers and bus mufflers.  I'm thinking the performance
would be about the same, but the bus might sound different, not as &quot;chirpy&quot;.
I think the dual pea shooters make that noise, but the single bus output
pipe doesn't since it doesn't have the same type baffling/packing.

Any thoughts or recommendations?

Dean

P.S. - my email address has changed - see above.  I have a forward on the
old address but don't know for how long.  Thanks.
