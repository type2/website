Subject: 70 Bus stuff

Hey Y'all,
  As many of you know I just got a pair of new Busses. I went to get the 
70(thought it was a 69) and it was a good trip home using a tow bar 
until the tow bar broke! The Bus was only connected by half of the bar 
and it was about to break. But God loves me and must love my Bus too, It 
happened just as I was turning into the driveway at my parents house! No 
damage to anything. I almost freaked when I saw it let go, I was just 
doing over 45mph on a four lane road at rush hour. I also discovered 
something on it, it has a Zee Bed convertion in it. This is not a camper 
but the back seat folds into a very nice bed. If you lay down with your 
head in the middle of the Bus and open the sun roof on a summer night 
you can see the stars while drifting off to sleep. Does it get any 
better then this? It also came with a tach mounted in the blank hole. 
Its not a VW tach but it looks good anyway. It is exactly the right size 
and mounted from behind.
  Now I have a question or two. What is the difference in the Exhaust 
system from a bug to the Bus(68-71) I have heard talk of the restricted 
Bug exhaust on a Bus, but I don't know the difference. The one I have on 
the 70 looks like a Bug muffler, how do I tell if it is or not?
  The Bus came factory with a Generator, but the guy put it in another 
one he had and gave me an Alternator. Its complete but I am not sure 
about hooking it up. Is there a web page that covers this? I looked on 
the type II library and archives but I didn't find anything. Its the 
same as doing the convertion on a bug right?
  Does anyone have some used bumpers for a 68-72 Bus. I don't care if 
they are not perfect, I don't have any right now. I also need the 
brackets. Does anyone sell reproductions of these at a reasonable price?
   Well thanks for any info anyone can give me.
