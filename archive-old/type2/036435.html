Subject: Re: 009 dist in a 1700

I have a stock 1800 with dual weber 40's.  I purchased it with an .009 
installed.  I installed a rebuilt engine and brought it to a local VW shop 
with a good reputation for the engine's final carb setup and correct jetting. 
 

They didn't want to do anything until they had a stock distributor to work 
with.  I said &quot;but the carbs don't have a port for a vacuum signal to the 
stock dist.&quot;  They said no problem, they can tap the carb and install a port 
in the correct place.

I produced a stock, correct for the engine and model year, dual vacuum, dual 
advance distributor.  They tapped the left carb, hooked up the advance side 
of the vacuum can to it and everything seems fine.

** question to anyone reading this**
Should I cap the now unused port on the retard side the dist's vacuum can to 
prevent moisture and dust from entering, or leave it open to ensure its 
proper function???

If you cannot find a stock dist., the sense I get from people with knowledge 
and experience is to install the .050 centrifugal advance dist. on the type 
IV engines.  This dist. is designed for engines of this connecting rod length 
(including porsche 356/912).
