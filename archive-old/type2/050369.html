Subject: [T2] Starter question

I have had long term problems with my starter.  Ever since my ignition
broke and i went with switches i have been wearing out starters
regularly.  I even went with a direct line off the battery so i could
start the engine from back there.  I don't know what is killing the
starters but that was all for naught when my van got rammed in the rear
as it wa parked on the side of the road a couple weeks ago.  The guy left
without leaving a note.  It looked as though he was trying to turn to
miss and his front right corner nailed my van centered right on the rear
crankshaft pulley knocking the van 6 feet forward.  After i got all sheet
metal off i was hopeful that the engine was not actually damaged.  It
turns fine but i was still dealing with my starter problem.  I got a
replacement solenoid for my starter from Bus Depot.  i put it in and
hooked it up and WHIRRR.  It did not engage with the flywheel.  Just to
check i pulled a starter from my other van that i know works and it did
the same thing.  Is there some reason my starter which works in one van
does not in the other?  The engines are not the same but i have lost
track of which is which, i am pretty sure the engine is one i salvaged
from the side of the road and used an adapter kit to put it in the van. 
It was definitely from bug or other type.  Do i need a different type
starter or is the damage done?  One more point,  I do have reason to
think the engine will run.  I got a little kick when i was turning the
engine by hand and the ignition was on.

thanks for reading,
scott
