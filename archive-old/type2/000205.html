I was looking through the archives to see if putting the lead additive in
the gasoline helps prevent engine damage.  I seem to remember that older
cars needed the lead for the valves (or something like that).  I remember
when lead gas was replaced with unleaded but I was only a kid.

Any wisdom would be appreciated.
Thanks,
