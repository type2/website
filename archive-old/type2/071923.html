When ckecking over the engine of my 82 2L last night I discovered that
there is a
 1/2in brass pipe on the right hand carb. that has nothing connected to it
and it's drawing in air. Could someone please give me some guidance as to
where it should be connected to. Haynes gives a good description of the 1.6
system but not the 2L.

P.S.This list makes comming to work worthwhile.
Thanks
Martin
