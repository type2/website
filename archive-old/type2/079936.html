&lt;&lt; I just read the fine print on the Condon and Skelly insurance. It said 
annual mileage limited to 2,500 and no driving to work, school or shopping.  
I can live with the 2500 but I'd hate to have an accident in a shopping 
center and find myself without any liability coverage.

Anybody know of any insurance policies that aren't so conservative yet offer 
a low rate for antique cars? &gt;&gt;

In a word, probably not. Also, be careful with &quot;antique&quot; insurance...If you 
should
be stopped by a knowledgable officer, you'd best have a parade or show flyer
to back up your being on the road.
