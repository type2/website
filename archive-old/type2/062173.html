Dear Fellow VW Bussers!

At this point I don't care if you give a damn about my brakes :-)

I fixed &quot;We Made It!&quot; (69 westy) tonight after a month-and-a-half long
movie about brakes.  May I recap the experience here?

Well, it began during the test drive with Mike the PO.  He was spilling
his guts about the bus's problems, what he had fixed, what he had not
fixed, the PPO story, everything.  I really appreciated his honesty and
that did more for me buying the bus than anything. ($800 cash + trade of
a pretty piece of Tiger Eye I found in Arkansas on the way to Rainbow
and blessed there.)

Well, the main problem he told me about was the brake master cylinder
had a leak, and needed to be replaced.  He made me promise to fix it and
&quot;not keep putting brake fluid in it...&quot;

My only previous experience with brakes had been changing shoes, disks,
and rotors which I've done on all my many vehicles.  I had never
actually dealt with fluid before.  I have plenty tools, and a little
experience turnin' bolts, and I know how frustrating it can be.  So I
started by calling the first VW mechanic I could find, and asking point
blank, for a ballpark estimate on replacing the MC.  $400.00.  I know I
could have had it done for half that, but I decided right then to do it
myself.  I had already read much of St. Muir, and Chilton.

Thanks to the person who told me how to get the clevis pin out of the
pedal linkage!  (Use a C-Clamp and a 13mm socket.  Use the power of the
screw to push the pin out into the socket.  Brilliant.)

Getting the MC off was simple enough after that, although I messed up
the front driver brake line.  I was being careful, but the threaded
piece was stuck on the line, and the line twisted as soon as I started
to turn it.  I dropped everything, and got advice from type2_at_primenet
once again.  I made a brake line ($5.50), I acquired a new MC ($60.00)
no trade-in required.  I wish the MC had come with a new pushrod, boot,
and reservoir.  Anybody know where to get the reservor, filler tube, and
the reservoir for the dash?  When I reinstalled the filler tube, there
was a bad leak around the nozzle, and I fixed it by taking a 2&quot; piece of
Heater Hose, pressing the filler tube 1&quot; into the hose, and putting the
other end of the hose into the reservoir nozzle.  I attached it with a
hose clamp.  No leak.  I hope brake fluid doesn't eat through heater
hose!  (Does it?)

Next step.  Installation of the new brake line and the new MC was very
straightforward, although I did buy another brake line and re-did it
because I was not 100% happy with the bends I made.

Then, the very first day I had a person with an extra foot, I set out
optomistically to bleed the brakes.  The first wheel went great.  Then I
discovered that the bleeder valve was broken off completely, on the rear
driver wheel.  I tried everything suggested on type2_at_primenet (thanks
again list members!).  But there was no way to get the broken valve out.
I did not try tapping the threads because that would have put pieces of
metal in the cylinder, or could have.

I spent much time trying to locate a 46mm socket, and finally took
advice to go to the Vdub shop and get the &quot;hammer wrench&quot;.  Good advice.
That was $8.95, the brake shoes were $26.95, the wheel cylinders (both)
were $10.95 each.

Man were those nuts hard to get off.  And on.  I hope that I put them on
tight enough.  I just used the hammer wrench and pounded the truck out
of them, until they were tight and were at the right place for a cotter
pin.  Yes I used new cotter pins.

I adjusted the brakes by opening the rear star wheel until the shoe
stopped the drum, then backed off five clicks, then did the forward star
wheel.  Hope that's right.

All reassembled, I went to bleed the brakes again.  No luck.  There was
always an unlimited supply of air to the front brakes.

The solution was any or all of the following:

I put a bead of silicone around where the reservoir plugs into the MC.
I tightened down all the fittings to both forward brake lines -very-
much tighter than I thought I should have.  I bled the problem brake
first the next day, by myself, with a tube on the bleeder, a wrench in
one hand, and pulling on the brake pedal linkage with the other :-)  I
got a -lot- less air and decided it was fixed, and did the one-man bleed
by myself, with a long tube, and the rear view mirrors.  I didn't expect
to succeed 100%, but by God I expected to get some pressure under the
pedal.

It worked.  The pedal actually has pressure under it!  It stops the bus,
at least as much as I dared to test it (started it, put it in 1st with
the brake pedal on and with it off :-)  I will not actually drive it
until I bleed the brakes again with a helper.  But at least now it will
be do-able.

I think I should plan to change the front brake shoes soon.  To be
honest, I haven't even taken the hubcaps off the front yet.  Will
someone please tell me what to expect?  Is it the same difficult 46mm
nut?  I've seen the inside of the rear brake, and according to Muir it's
the same but upside down, and no parking brake.

Oh well, if you got this far, thank you for reading.  I hope my
experience will help someone who's about to do their first brake job.

Peace!
