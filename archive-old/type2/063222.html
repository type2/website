Subject: HELP WITH YEAR!

Hello Volks!

My brother Danny and I have been working (90% restoed) on a '71 Westphalia 
Campmobile. 

Or so we thought. Now we're not so sure it's a 71.

If the metal sticker near the driver's side says 10/70 (production/manufacture 
date?), that means it was really a '71, right?

Thing is, we just noticed a Westphalia sticker on a cabinet (previuously covered 
by old carpeting) that says Campmobile 70.

I'd appreciate any help in deciphering. We're going with '71 for now.

THANKS!

Marcos and Danny Moure
Miami, FL
71 (maybe) Westy
