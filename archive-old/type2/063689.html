So Thom Fitzpatrick says:

&gt; Its been a couple years since I've seen a split-window at a pick-n-pull.  I
&gt; pulled every last piece off that baby I could, too!
&gt; 
&gt; I heard Paul Rubens gets all his parts at &quot;You Pull It&quot;
&gt; (Paul Rubens is PeeWee Herman's other name...)

Hmmm... I thought it was 'Jerk and Save'....  ;)

VW content.....   I think you won't find splits in any yards because
people that own them know that they are scarce and have firmed up 
or raised their selling prices....  Not to mention others that horde
them... :(
