Subject: Anybody for a cheap 68 Westy in N. Alabama?

I have stumbled across a 68 Westfalia on a local &quot;US cars only&quot;
junkyard.
Seems a deadhead broke down and gave up on it. Its got all the required
deadhead stickers and a particulary funny one on the inside:
&quot;Thank you for pot smoking&quot;. Hadn't seen that one yet.
The storage under the seat is completely filled with food cans (I still
have to check the expiration dates).
The car still has Oregon plates on it and is quite rustfree, except for
the cab floor. The underside looks like new. Oregon must be good on
cars.
It has a couple of dents and is not quite complete. The paint (green)
looks original.

As the junkyard is going to part it out I feel obligated to buy it and
pass it on to someone who will put it on the road again.

If anybody is interested please p-mail me. Your looking at ~$650
(including cans).

This car would be good for the guy who was at the Georgia Campout last
weekend in that incredibly rusty red Westy. He needed a replacement
part: one complete body.

BTW the car has an &quot;Old Volks Home&quot; license plate frame. This definitely
provided some nationwide advertising.

The car is in Huntsville, Alabama.
