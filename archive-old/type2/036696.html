Subject: Re: [Cylinder shim question (long techie question)]

Dave,
Everyone suggests using one shim per cylinder to prevent oil leaks.

My CR adjustment called for a .070&quot; shim under the cylinder.  No one sells
them in this size (at reasonable cost), so ordered a set of .090&quot; shims and am
having them ground to .070&quot;.  Interesting find:  the shims i bought were as
much as .018&quot; out with respect to each other, so having them ground (both
sides) trued them up, which will reassure me that all of my torque specs will
be true when i tourque the heads down.

I wonder how many engines just get slapped together with shims that are all
out of whack and what sort of 'mystery problems' are a result of poorly
machined shims?

something to think about?

&gt; Hey y'all
&gt; My ISP keeps dropping the mail server so I've been off'n on the list
&gt; (admins PLEASE LET ME KNOW so I have ammo to go back to them with).
&gt; 
&gt; My lovely wife measured the deck heights and re-cc'd the heads (hint -
&gt; use a Sharpie or other indelible marker instead of pencil if you're
&gt; writing measurements on the head).  Anyways, using Ron and Dale's most
&gt; excellent nifty Excell cr calculator we arrived at the following
&gt; figures:
&gt; Cylinder   #1 #2 #3 #4
&gt; 
&gt; Bore (mm) 90.5
&gt; Stroke (mm) 69
&gt; Area of Base (mm)  6429
&gt; Deck Height  (mm) Calculated 2.92 2.84 2.97 2.92
&gt; Deck Volume (cc's) Calculated 18.77 18.28 19.09 18.77
&gt; Swept Volume (cc's) Calculated 443.62 443.62 443.62 443.62
&gt; Chamber Volume (cc's) Measured 57.93 58.05 57.55 57.50
&gt; Total Volume  (cc's) Calculated 520.32 519.95 520.27 519.89
&gt; 
&gt; Original Deck Height (Inches) Measured 0.033 0.03 0.047 0.045
&gt; Shim Height (Inches)                            0.082 0.082 0.07 0.07
&gt; Total Deck Height (Inches) Calculated    0.115 0.112 0.117 0.115
&gt; Cylinder  Volume                  #1    #2    #3     #4
&gt; Average Value                      57.93 58.05 57.55 57.50
&gt; Shim Height (Inches)             0.082 0.082 0.07 0.07
&gt; Compression Ratio Calculated 6.78 6.81 6.79 6.82
&gt; 
&gt; Our question is this:  Is it permissible to use 2 shims at the base to
&gt; get the required deck height?  We want to keep the cr low yet still have
&gt; to go to pull the mountains (and stumps if need be).
&gt; 
&gt; Please guide us, o wise and venereable gurus!
