Subject: Bus Names page update.

Greets All -

I hope this is enough bus content to keep me from getting booted...

The Bus Names page grew from 50 original names to almost 140. As new names
are tapering off, I am now ready to start taking URL's.

I'm not putting model years or variations of Type2 on the BusNames page, as
I think it would cloud the page somewhat. That info can be specified on your
baby's web page.

Let the URL's begin! At the bottom of the page will be &quot;mailto:&quot; reference.
Please use that one if you can - it's my home email address, whereas I
subscribe to Type2 via my work. Give me the bus name and URL, and we'll
build this baby together.

Thanks -
