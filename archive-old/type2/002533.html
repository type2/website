Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch to flywheel bolts on a 75

[...]


&gt; On inspection of the bolts that hold the pressure plate to the flywheel
&gt; I found one that has a stripped head. These are 12 point socket heads. 7
&gt; mm I think. Took one to the local bolt and nut shop, they said what the
&gt; H--- is that. Don't stock it, can't order it!

7mm??
All the type4 clutch bolts I ever put in are 8mm x 1.25 and around 20-25 mm
long. They have a 13mm hex head on them.
