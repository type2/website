I agree with Rick.  A lightened flywheel will not gain you any horsepower at all.  Plus a counterweighted crank (which is much heavier than stock) will cancel out much of the weight saved in the flywheel.

IMO the bus needs a heavier flywheel, not lighter.

&gt;&gt;say if a person with a type I- powered bus lived in a very hilly area like
&gt;&gt;the ozarks or cascades and did most of their driving there...wouldn't it be
&gt;&gt;a benefit to use a 12.5# flywheel with a counterweighted crank?  i realize
&gt;&gt;the stock flywheel would be better for long flat hauls....where i live,
&gt;&gt;there is like five 30 degree hills every mile....
