Subject: Re: removing alternator on 1600 engine?

&gt; Maybe we were doing it wrong, but it always worked, and I've done it on
&gt; my own bus.  You just have to get  up in the engine compartment with your
&gt; engine.

I have also worked in a VW shop and they would always replace the alternator
or dynamo with the engine in. Use a cheater/breaker bar or a length of tube
on the end of your ratchet, and you can use this jammed against the roof of
the engine compartment so that you can now use the front of the alternator
to tighten up the rear nut. Job done.
