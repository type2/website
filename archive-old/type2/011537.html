Subject: rebuilding steering box

You know,  this steering box discusion got me remembering that shortly
after I bought my bus I went to one of the local VW FLAPS.  He convinced
me that the steering box would probably need rebuilding and that he just
happen to have the parts that are normally worn and get replaced.

He sold me a new peg shaft and new peg and rollers.  I hope this wasn't
wasted money.  I mainly bought them because he said the new units were
NLA and rebuilt ones were 200.00 to 300.00 dollars.  

he's been pretty good to work with over the months and the Bentley
DOES show disassembly and adjustment..... My question is ' Are these
items the only things replaced in a rebuilt steering box?  
Looks easy to do but I've never read about anybody on the list doing it.

Opinions solicited.

BTW I'd like to thank David Schwarze for the Mopar Rust Penetrant tip.
The stuff is fantastic.  Lossened some rusted/stubborn license plate 
bolts that Liquid Wrench failed to budge.  I did a test with LW on one
bolt and MRP in the other.  Guess which won?  ;)
