Subject: FI Parts Questions

I have both a CA equipped '80 westi and a non-CA '80 Westi.
I have been reviewing Skip's archives to determine the differences in 
the FI system.  Most of the components are the same, but where there 
are differences, the Bosch name for a component is not the same as 
the Bently or Haynes name.  Could someone provide a description and 
location of the following parts?

ECU - Exchange    non-CA only
(not a clue what or where this is)
The Brain. Above, in front of battery on right side. Behind the big connector
It can be sepcific to the Air Flow Sensor, and Throttle Switch

Resistor Unit         non-CA only
(is this mounted on the LF firewall consisting of lots of white wires 
attached to white cylindrical objects surrounded by aluminum)

&gt;YES

Combi-Relay          different model numbers CA vs non-CA
(is this the fuel pump relay mounted on the LF firewall with a square 
connector from the FI wiring harness and another square connector 
from the main wiring harness?)

&gt;YES

Vacuum Limiter      different model numbers CA vs non-CA
(is this the big vacuum biscuit mounted above the engine or the 
deceleration valve mounted on the vertical engine tin or something 
else altogether)

&gt;????

AIr Flow Meter      different model numbers CA vs non-CA
(I assume that this is the Air Flow valve that is the throttle cable 
attaches to?)
&gt;NO. The air flow valve with the throttle cable is the 'throttle body'. The
&gt;Air flow sensor is between this and the air cleaner. It is a 3&quot;x2&quot;x5&quot;
&gt;cast aluminum box that the air flows through. It will be specific to model
&gt;year, and the ECU. 

BTW what/where are the following parts. They are the same, but I want 
to be educated on my FI system.


Temperature Sensor Coolant
&gt;??

Thermo-Time Switch (NOT the Cold Start Valve)
&gt;On a 76 this is under teh air distibutor which is the black can in the middle
&gt;that the cold start valve mounts on. The thermo time switch contols the cold 
&gt;start valve. If the engine is cold, it turns the cold start valve on for about 
&gt;10 seconds. If hot, it doesn't turn it on. warm may be between 0-10 seconds?

I am trying to move all the CA equipment from CA bus to the non-CA 
bus &amp; I want to get all the right equipment, but don't want to 
exchange parts unecessarily.

&gt;For More info try: this site : 
&gt;gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:70/00/Miscellaneous/Vanagon/Files/Bosch-Fuel-Injec
&gt;tion-Info-Bus-1974-1979
&gt;which lists bosch part numbers by year for various cars..
