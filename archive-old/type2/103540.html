Subject: Re: [T2] Buses on very bad roads: fine or foolhardy?

&gt; ridiculous places -- trailheads in the Cascades, particularly -- at the

&gt; inches of flowing water like a meadow trail in springtime, you name it.
&gt; Places where the only other vehicles on the road are the sort that

&gt; The Bus obviously has more clearance.  It also seems to have better
&gt; traction than the front-wheel-drive Subaru.  It also appears to care
&gt;  
&gt; Can a carefully driven Bus negotiate such terrain, or am I foolish to
&gt; even have such thoughts?  Are there frame/suspension parts that, given
&gt; proper maintenance and absent rust, still can't handle a rough road?

over the many many years (over 25) that I have driven buses I have taken
em to some pretty foolhardy places, and so far they have all brought me
back out.  but it was close a few times.

&gt; How far do you have to tip a Bus before it decides to roll over?  How
&gt; easy is it to get a Bus hopelessly stuck?

don't know never tried to check that, but I can assure you that at least
my old 60 23 window splitty would float and keep going enough to get me
out of a ponded road that was a LOT deeper than it looked.


just remember to take spare parts
let other people know your itinerary
and drive easy
