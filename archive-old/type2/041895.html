Brad-

If you check out http://www.scottandmaggie_dot_com/gearcalc.asp, there's an
Excel spreadsheet (if I remember correctly) that gives the conversions
between RPM and MPH for each gear.  You can use that to make a rough
estimate of what your tach should be reading based on your speed (assuming
the speedo is about right).  At 3200 RPM, I think your bus should be doing
about 40 MPH in third gear or 62 MPH in fourth.

Cheers,
Alistair

&gt;  Volks,
&gt;     I have a '79 2.0L FI with Calif emissions. I just installed a
&gt; tachometer
&gt; and I was wondering in this tach is working properly. It seems to
&gt; be maxing
&gt; out about 3200 RPM. I looked in bently's book and found nothing. I would
&gt; appreciate info about the RPM if there is one and if I modifiy it
&gt; or what? I
&gt; need some info.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
