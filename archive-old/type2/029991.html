&gt; Must ask the august list (remember, bus depot is a 2 hr trip, gotta
&gt; finish this by Mon)- my '78 crank endplay is 10 thou and I want to get
&gt; it to 3 or 4- so figger I need to increase shims by 6  o 7 thou- current
&gt; stack is about 35 thou (why is combo of measured individuals shims
&gt; greater than sum of parts- ie, 37 thou)?????

It's because the shims are not _quite_ flat.  That is normal with use.
I'd recommend new shims to get the measurements correct.

&gt; Unfortunately my shims and
&gt; ones on a junker run between 10 up to 12.5 and no combo of 3 or even 4
&gt; would work- so gotta ask 2 things
&gt; 1.  Is running 4 shims any problem physically speaking (George Lyle, you
&gt; there?)- I could use 4 and also the following:

No physical problem running any number of shims, but you have to ask why
the play has opened up so much that you need to add a 4th shim.  Is the
wear on the aft side of the thrust surface or the forward side?  If it is
on the forward side, you will be forcing the crankshaft to run further aft
than it was designed to do, perhaps causing misalignment to the other
bearings.

Another possibility is that the thrust bearing is loose in the case, so
you are measuring the play between the bearing and the case, not
the clearance between the shim pack and the bearing.  If you put in enough
shim thickness to fix this, you'll find your crank locked up as the thrust
bearing will be trapped between the shims and the crank.

The shims come in .24, .30, .32, .34, and .36mm, which gives a
shim pack range of .72mm to 1.08mm.  If your no-shim play is greater than
that, I'd want to open the case for a look-see.  If I wasn't able to do
that, I'd just put the original shims back into place and run it that way
until I had the money to fix it right.  

&gt; 2. Any reason paper made shims can't be inserted between any 2 metal
&gt; ones to increase stack thickness?  (I remember, in the 71 I had, a paper
&gt; shim is used to bring out the flywheel, but it's fixed and doesn't
&gt; spin)-since crushed lazer paper is about 2 thou I could also bring out
&gt; the flywheel a hair and use the 4 lowest shims?)

These shims aren't held in the crushed position, but are free to float
relative to each other, so the paper shim will get tossed out pretty
quickly.  It would probably get stuck in the seal recess, but 

&gt; 3. Is the 71 crank the same diameter, if I root hard enough, I may find
&gt; some of them??

I don't think it is different in this area.
