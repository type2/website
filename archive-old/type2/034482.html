    On the other hand, I was in my Bus in a parking space, when an
elderly
woman back-
ing into the space behind me, clipped my left rear corner. I got out to
look
at it and in-
form her of what she had done. She politely looked at the damage (slight
to
be sure),
and said, with a smile, &quot;Oh, that's okay, it's just an old car
anyway...&quot;

I wonder if this &quot;Lady&quot;? if she ever ran into an old PERSON,  would just
say &quot;oh, that's okay, it's just an old PERSON anyway&quot;?  TWWM, uj
