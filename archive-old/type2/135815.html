Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Servo

I drove my 73 for months without the booster being connected. I just
recently replaced all the lines to have my booster back online.

While it's very possible to drive without it (one leg is much more
muscular than the other now..), I don't recommend it. The 73's with
front disk brakes stop beautifully when it's all working correctly!
Without the boost I had to give myself even more room to stop than
normal. Like a mile. And in panic stops it was impossible to properly
measure the pressure I was applying to the brakes and I locked them up
frequently, to my consternation and embarrassment and my passenger's
need for new underwear...
