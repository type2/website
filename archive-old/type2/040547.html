Subject: Fuel Filter Change Intervals:  So Soon?

Hello All --
I can't remember the exact month when I last changed my fuel filter, but it
seems like it wasn't that long ago (i.e. I'm thinking 6-8 months).  With
that in mind, here's the deal: this morning I took off and felt a slight
hesitation just after shifting into 2nd.  Didn't think much of it.  10
miles or so later after just shifting into 3rd, I accelerated and for a few
moments got just about nothing -- my head almost hit the windshield -- and
then I was going forward again.  For the next 6 or 7 miles until I got her
home, it was hesitating bad at high RPMs (especially when just about to
shift, while on hills, and/or with at least 5 other cars behind me) --
didn't think I would make it home.  Also, it idles just fine.  Now, I know
these are all classic &quot;change fuel filter&quot; signals -- it's doing pretty
much the same thing it was doing before the last time I changed it, which
solved the problem completely.  I plan to do it again, today.  I guess my
question is this: does this amount of time (approx. 6-8 mos.) between
filter changes seem unusually short?  Can a filter get clogged up again
that quickly?  It just seems like I just did it; I can almost still smell
the gas on the sweatshirt I was wearing at the time.  Thanks for your
input, and happy Friday...
