Subject: vanagon engine swap questions

hi,
I am looking into buying a extra engine that I can
rebuild in my spare time and I came across a 81 Vanagon
engine for sale. My bus is a 77' with a 79 engine in it,
not sure of transmission year any way of telling?
In Tom Wilsons book &quot;rebuilding your VW engine&quot; it says
the that 80-83 vanagon engines have a unique case and heads.
So I am wondering if anyone could tell me how compatible
a 79' engine is with this 81 vanagon engine.

I want to be able to swap out parts preferably, between
the 79' and 81'.
So here is what I'am hoping some one could help me with
answering;

will the 81 engine fit in the 77bus with a 77-79 trans?
What does Tom Wilson mean by unique case and heads?
Any one out there done this?

thanks to anyone that helps me out, as I dont
always remember to send out thank you msg's

Alex Wisniewski,
77 Riviera ...79' engine - &quot;fred&quot; possible name
