Subject: Re: Interim Bus Nose Fix

Was this the result of a front mounted spare?  I've often thought about taking
mine off, but it looks so good up there.

Also, I've been looking at a bus exactly like yours, but it scares me.  Isn't the
top bunk a bit like a coffin?  Or is this something that wasn't stock on the bus,
and someone threw a piece of wood up there and called it a bed?

Thanks,
