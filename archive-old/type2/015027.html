X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I'll just say that from what the detective told me, I think there are
inaccuracies in this article. Having worked for a newspaper before, I'm not
surprised.

Although I know she didn't have a perfect-running bus, I suspect it was
functional when she got to the rest stop. When she left here, I was
confident it would get her to California. A mechanic in the Appalacias had
reattached a flywheel that flew off and she was taking it easy (slow) as
she traveled.

I guess what I'm saying is that it's not fair to draw the assumption that
she was broke down. She would have been tired. It would have been better if
I'd asked her to stay here...I can't go back in time.

None of us should beat ourselves up over this. Bad shit happens to good
people sometimes...but in the grand scheme of things, this life is little
more than a whisper. It's better lived than not. Some of us live it
quietly; some loudly...some don't live it at all. I've been making choices
all my life.._dot_usually I choose the right way; sometimes I don't.

I'm gonna quit posting about this now, since there's not a bit of bus
content here. I hope this won't turn into an all-day thread about something
we all regret but can't change.

Thanks! Joe
