&gt;Trans-Canada, brilliant
&gt;but I would most like to do the section through the outports of Newfoundland
&gt;in our old 73 Safari Camper.
&gt;
&gt;After landing at Port aux Basques I would head north through Stevenville and
&gt;Cornerbrook up to Gros Morne National park. After a day or two of walking
&gt;the dog I would head up the great northern peninsula to Cooks Harbour and
&gt;have fish and fat with a real bayman.

hey,

If you did the trans-canada travel, don't forget to visit Quebec 
province. Don't go to fast thru our Country.

It's probably the best place for you do be (depaysed). The best to see 
different people. Imagine. Everybody is speaking french. There is more 
than half the population that don't speak english at all. For you it's 
like a trip thru Europe. Every thing is different!

Don't forget Quebec province!!!
