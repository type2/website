I blew my started Friday morning, on my way to a solitude camping weekend.

I had to go to a junk yard in Northern Virginia for a starter for my '78 
Westy.

Looking for only at the '75-79 Baywindows and a occasional '80 Vanagon, I 
ignored all the other buses and campers there.  Except one caught my eye.

Chris C. mentioned that the '73 rear light assembly (I think he meant the 
side marker assembly, but I was not sure) was not easy to  find.  This '72 
still had its side lens on, and I pulled one cover off.  It has a great 
looking base, even a decent gasket.

. . .  and this '72 cream colored two tone bus had a chrome strip along the 
separation between the top and bottom colors.

All in all, this bus was choice, and I may take a drive back just to look 
for soem cherrys.

Any body interested in the chrome belt line, e-mail me.  I plan to go down 
there after I come back from church and change clothes...
