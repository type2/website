Subject: Re: [T2] Modern day CD player into our Bay windows??

Wrong ... If your dahsboard has not been cut yet, it has a small rectangular
center opening and two round holes for the volume and tuning knob. The only
units that will fit w/o cutting are pre-1990s (80s?) era stereos that were
meant to be mounted by the stems of the volume pot and tunining capacitor.
Any modern (DIN-sized) unit requires cutting - and that includes ALL
CD-players.

It will fit without cutting ...
