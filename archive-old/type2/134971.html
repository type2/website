Subject: Re: [T2] Pulling a Vintage RV with a Bus

&gt; 1500 lbs is fine in Kansas. 1500 lbs in Colorado might be different.
&gt; Our bus does fine stopping 1500 lbs on dry pavement in TN. Colorado might 
&gt; be different...

I'd be pulling in Indiana/Ohio/Michigan area...pretty similar terrain.

&gt; I'd hitch up to your ideal trailer and try it for a mile or two. Can you 
&gt; turn or stop? Can you keep up with traffic?

This could be tricky...I'm largely limited to shopping via internet for a 
vintage 1970s Airstream

&gt; Does that help?

Yep

&gt; Personally I think towing a bus is better than a bus towing..

True, but it's either tow with the Bus or my wife's Newer Chrysler Van 
(Makes me shiver) and I'm definately pulled to the thought that it would be 
fun to pull a '70s RV with a '70 Bus.

Has anyone out there experience with towing a small RV with a Bay Window 
Bus?
