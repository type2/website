&gt;&quot;Page 90: Models after November, 1975 no longer have an oil pressure
control
&gt;valve so don't look too long for it.&quot;
&gt;


Jeff notes this and actually last night I noted the same in the Bus Bentley
in figure 9.1 in the Engine and Clutch section showing the breakdown of the
T4 case.  As to what this means again for someone wanting to retrofit
hydraulic lifters into an early case, I don't know.  Again I mention
Automotion sells longer (to increase the spring pressure) oil relief pistons
for both pistons for use in the 914/912E (and de facto any T4) case.

Another interesting thing someone noted is that 411 cases apparently come
with the Bus style oil fill hole blocked (same for 914 cases?) in the
casting and feature a drilling down the breather for the fill oil.  In short
to use a 411 or I surmise but don't know 914 case would require the
annoyance of keeping the existing filler (not bad in a Vanagon, cramped in a
Bus) or carving out the bus fill hole and drilling and tapping for the
mounting stud and bolt or whatever.

I want to set it again straight for the record, there is NO PROBLEM
WHATSOEVER using a Vanagon case in a Bus, the Wilson quip otherwise is
rubbish, simply use the Vanagon clip on breather, or if you don't have it on
hand slip the breather tube directly over the steel pressed in flange
(though this is tough) and there is no change.  The only problem one will
run into regards the bearer mounting holes and for that one must simply be
prepared with 10mm bolts and drilling out your bus mount pads or I imagine
running a $0.25 helicoil down each hole.  But I'm not sure of that last, it
would work if the Vanagon case is threaded M10x1.25 (fine) for which you
would then use the 4 M8x1.25 bolts you have, if instead it was M10 coarse,
then you need to find M10 bolts.  I don't recall what the tread is, FWIW it
is the same as the rear late bay bumper mounting bolts, which we proceeded
to cut down, about the only damn scavengeable M10 bolts on a Bus on a Sunday
night.  Again though we also experienced something weird on the flywheel end
but perhaps that was just due to manufacturing tolerances.
