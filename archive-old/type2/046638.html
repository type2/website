Greetings all,
Upon my return from Alaska (many of you may recall my departure in May) the
bus has been running a bit differently.  After discussing it's irregular
idle with my mechanic and trouble shooting the seemingly obvious, I tried to
clean the air/fuel mixture regulator ( the little needle and electrical
plate looking thing under the cover on top of my engine.)  I was told to be
VERY careful as these parts are very easily broken.  After doing this the
bus ran great for two days.  now it doesn't want to idle at all.  It dies
immediately after starting.  After consulting  bentley and muir I am
stumped.  Any ideas on what to do next?  Much thanks.
Dave
'77 Westy
(p.s.  The bus made it all the way through the stix to AK and provided me
and my sinificant other a great summer home.  Time for me to treat it with
some lovin...)
