Subject: Battery Tray 68-71, 72-79 what's the difference.

I just received a battery tray that I ordered for my 71 bus. It was
advertised as 68-78 but when I received it it is labeled as 72-79. I looked
in the RMMW catalog and the have two separate parts listed.

Can I used the 72-79 battery tray on my 71?
What are the differences?
