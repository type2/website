I remember a while back at a previous Vanfest in the UK (I think 3 years ago) that
there was a board with an announcement saying VAG-UK now deem it okay to remove
these bulkheads.

BUT I'd not do it, partly because its a good rule to follow that if you remove
strength you should add it back (and that would be a PITA here) and also because
you don't need to, unless you're installing a shower into a camper (if you don't
understand that anyone, pmail me and I'll explain!!) Or do you wish to install
swivelling cab seats, like wot are so popular in Vanagons?

RE:	Seat Pedestals (Bulkheads?)

[...]
Can the pedestals (bulkheads?) behind the front seats of a '74 bus be removed to
facilitate installation of alternative seating? Will this impair the structural
integrity of the vehicle?
