Subject: fuel leak



hey everyone,


   I have recently noticed a fuel leak under my bus :(  It is coming from a 
short hose that is connected to the fuel pump.  The end that is leaking is 
not connected to anything.  It doesn't appear to ever have been connected to 
anything.  It leaks at about 1 drip every second or two.  It is a 74 Bus.  
Please help... should i just plug the hose?

Jason
