Subject: Re: [T2] Click &amp; Clack...two guys, one brain

Those guys about 4 years ago listed the 10 worst cars of all time. Here is 
the list...
10. VW bus
 9. Renault Dauphine 
 8. Cadillac Cimarron
 7. Dodge Aspen (Plymouth Volare)
 6. Renault LeCar
 5. Chevy Chevette
 4. AMC Gremlin
 3. Ford Pinto
 2 Chevy Vega
And the worst car ever made is......#1...Yugo....
I rarely wsee any of the other cars on the road and that makes sense. They 
are all in the 
junkyard by now. But that doesn't fit the bus. I see them everyday. How can 
they be 
an alltime worst car and still be everywhere doing work for people. It 
doesn't compute. 
Those guys are losing there credibility.
