Subject: Re: [T2] running engine with no seal.   Part2


&gt; reason i ask is because i am thinking of buying a type
&gt; IV 1979 engine. it has been recently rebuilt but
&gt; apparently the dude has been running it with the
&gt; engine seal.  thanks again!

Matty,
You need to look close at that 79 engine. Look at the exhaust ports/exhaust
pipes on the heads. If it has 79 heads, it will have square ports. 72 to 78 has
oval ports. Two totally different styles, not interchangeable.
