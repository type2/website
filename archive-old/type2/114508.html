Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Thought's of Air Shocks

Longer bolt goes on top, Terry. And 100k miles later, I've had not problem 
one with my air-shock upgrades. As folks on the list who know me, or who have 
met me at the last Everybus get together will attest to, I'm 'prolly running the 
only Baja bus on the East Coast, and I beat the pure shit out of my 
suspension every weekend trying in vain to keep up with the sand rails that Sean at 
TransporterWerks has built. Those upper shock mounts are VERY stout. Remember, 
coil-overs were a stock option on the Bays.
