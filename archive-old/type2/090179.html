&gt; First I wanted to say that getting the ends out proved to be agony.  I
&gt; attribute this to the crummy tie-rod puller that I rented from Autozone

&gt; It was missing the shoulder of the puller in the Bentley picture and it kept
&gt; slipping off.  I had to ratchet the puller a click at a time in order to
&gt; apply direct pressure to the tie-rod end while keeping it aligned and
&gt; eventually it popped out.  Getting the rusted cotter pins out wasn't a
&gt; picnic either.  Oh well, watch out for cheap pullers like the one I used.

Richard,

I am afraid the only pullers I trust are expensive because, alas, they are
snap-on.  I do not by and large recommend them becaues they are hideously
overpriced, but in this case, they must have a patent because they are the
only maker.  Search e-bay for &quot;snap on gear puller&quot; and look for the CJ
series.  Right now there is a CJ2002 set which will probably go for
~$250-300 and a CJ85 which will go for ~75-100.  That CJ85 is what you
need tho.  It will do any front-end pull and pop the early steering wheels
off w/o breaking them up.

&gt; What can I use to align the wheels myself?  It's only $59 to get a front
&gt; wheel alignment which I'm overdue for but I'd like to know anyway.  The
&gt; tools in the Bentley aren't commonly found are they?

Alas, another job it's just too cheap to pay someone else to do.  I do
find that I have to stand over them, tho as the shops have not done a bus
in the working lifetime of any of their employees.
