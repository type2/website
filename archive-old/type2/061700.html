Subject: Re: Just ordered an engine - MSHP - Stage II

      Whoops, I mispoke! Just looked again at the Kennedy Engineering
site (http://www.kennedyeng_dot_com/sub_van.htm)  and they're saying 9.0:1
for the '86-'90 Vanagon and 9.5:1 for the '90-'94 Subaru run okay on 87
octane.
       Thanks for posting that url, George -- I think my next Vanagon is
going to have to get Subaru-ized.
