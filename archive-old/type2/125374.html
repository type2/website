Subject: Re: [T2] A little advice

Eric,

There have been quite a few posts lately on whether to give up or keep
going. I say the buses are either in your soul or not. If you like your bus,
don't worry about what others say. I have never had personal experience with
Shaffner Motors, however there was a time a few years ago when I was on Ebay
all the time and I noticed a seller who had some very negative feedback.
They eventually had to change their name and start a new account...it was
Shaffner Motors. I am not going to continue to harp on them, but I would
ignore what they say for now.

Here is my advice: if you are unsure and you have never pulled an engine
before I wouldn't do it. You can change the fuel lines, plug wires, learn to
set your timing and other things to get the bus running optimally without
the risk of diminishing the value of the bus. Once you do a few things to it
you might find yourself with a renewed joy of the bus from accomplishing
something.

Once you get to that point you will know whether you want to continue on
buses in general. Sell it or...start looking at the junk yards around your
area. If your bus has that much rust and it's not feasible to keep it on the
road in the long run I would look for a good, non-rusty, bus without an
engine. Search for something to build on, pull your engine and start really
working on it and then put it back in the new bus. By this point your
excitement will grow with a bus you really feel has a future. Now you can
concentrate on restoring it or getting some of your money back by selling
it. If you get to this point you will want to research what to look for in a
bus that will last. Any bus can be restored with enough money, but for a
newbie this is too much to tackle.

Hope this helps,

Rob Henley
