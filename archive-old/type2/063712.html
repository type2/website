&gt;&gt;and front walk would be just the ticket.  We removed the middle seat from
&gt;&gt;our VW bus and headed to the site.  We spent a couple of hours neatly
&gt;&gt;stacking bricks in the bus until we had a cube about 5x5 feet x 3 feet
&gt;&gt;high.  I have no idea what it weighed, but the bus wouldn't even move.  It
&gt;&gt;just groaned and stalled.  So we spent another hour unloading two-thirds of
&gt;&gt;the pile. Just because it fits, doesn't mean it's a good idea...

&gt;I carried a ton of manure in bags in my '59 w/36hp once. Slow to get going
&gt;but it was a smooth ride.

So when someone says you're full of.... never mind!

I towed my X-girlfriend's BMW 530i with my '56 one time.  And when I was
moving into this house, I packed the '56 to the gills, room only for me,
barely, axles splayed and everything.  With a 40hp on its last legs.  I
could not get going fast enuf to get out of 2nd gear.  Took 45 minutes to
travel 4 miles!

When I picked up the parts stash from the guy down the street, I filled the
buss up halfway past the windows with milk crates full of parts, such as
cranks, flywheels, cams, P/C's, etc.  Felt like driving a semi (articulated
lorry)
