Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Seating Question

i have to agree with with greg, because that's what i have. in my 75
westfalia i removed the sink cabinetry. i found its storage space cramped
my life given the volume of that space, no factory spare tire to put in
there, and the sink is just a plain stupit horse piss stream with a basin
large enough to wash a mug at a time. i installed a rear facing seat in its
place which has nice storage and allows me to carry five other people. it
has a seatbelt i installed, and if anyone wants detals on how i did that,
ask, i have photos. with three children that's a bonus. it'll hold a
mother-in-law too, but that's a different nida bonus. this set up outweighs
the problems of any one-year only stuff, for me.
one improvement i can think of to increase storage would be to add the
shelf over the engine which attaches to the rear closet. i've lived without
one, but am now considering the need. so if you can do without the sink,
think about the options; a rear facing seat is a good one.

on my 69 sunroof i have a full length pull out too. behind the cab seats i
am going with two rear facing seats for a while. hopefully i can get a
spare tire into the construction of one of those seats. that's gonna take a
shoehorn.
