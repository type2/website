&gt; I believe that the primary
&gt;  function of the catalytic converter is to lower unburned HC emissions, as
&gt;  the cat takes unburned fuel in the exhaust and burns it in the converter,
&gt;  for lack of a better term.  This has the effect of lowering HC 
(hydrocarbon)
&gt;  emissions and probably also has a similar effect on CO emissions since CO
&gt;  (carbon monoxide) is the product of incomplete combustion.

Sean,

This is exactly what the brochure says that Oregon DEQ passes out when you 
fail the test.  Vehicles manufactured prior to 1981 don't have to take the 
dynamometer based NO test, just HC, CO, CO + CO2.
