&gt;I found a LARGE pair of snap ring pliers at Sears.  About the size of tin
&gt;snips.  They have a flat spot on both blades.  Makes the removal and
&gt;installation very easy.  I think they were about $10.

I too found those big snap ring pliers (for external rings only) at Sears (appx. 2 yrs ago) and snapped them up b/c I knew they'd be perfect for the CV circlip on my bus.  They look like a pair of pliers, only they open when you squeeze the handles.  I just checked the Sears web site (Sears_dot_com) and couldn't find them listed in the section on Craftsman tools.  So, I don't know if Sears still stocks them, but you might check in person.
