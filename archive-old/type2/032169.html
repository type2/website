&gt; means i have a lean mix? i am in CA and have all this cool smog crap on my

--&gt;  First thing to check is your exhaust system.  If it has any leaks
(ANY leaks) the van will pop and sputter when you coast downhill or lift
your foot off the gas at speed.  These are both rich-running conditions,
and the unburned gas going out your exhaust ignites when it finds fresh
oxygen from all those exhaust leaks.  This is assuming these are backfires
out the exhaust, of course.  Backfires out the carbs are a different
matter.
