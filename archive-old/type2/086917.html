&gt; On second thought, I went to the trademark office
&gt; 
&gt; http://tess_dot_uspto_dot_gov/bin/gate.exe?f=tess&amp;state=m5tfv.1.1

wandered through myself.

type II  is a company that make simulated mortar explosions for the movie
industry??!!!

and type 2 is mostly a lot of folks concerned about diabetes

interesting.

&gt; 
&gt; and had a look for myself.  1580 trademarks which include the word 
&gt; bug...some live and some dead.  It is interesting that some I thought 
&gt; belonged to certian people, in fact, do not.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember the Holley &quot;bugspray&quot;...hmmm nope, not to holley, but to  
&gt; Sailwest Computing.  If vw thinks they can get the trademark for bug, then 
&gt; I suspect that a lot of these people are gonna have a fit.
&gt; 
&gt; Even the &quot;bug out&quot; folks.....try to guess...it doesn't belong to the 
&gt; people who put it on every year.  It belongs to  BUG-OUT OUTDOORWEAR, INC. 
&gt; CORPORATION NEBRASKA.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, so how about &quot;bus&quot;.   How about &quot;BUS PARTS WAREHOUSE&quot;....nope wrong 
&gt; again...they supply school bus parts.  Only 686 trademarks with the word 
&gt; bus...I guess this one would be easier.
&gt; 
&gt; The point being,  VW does not, nor has it ever, in my knowledge presented 
&gt; a trademark with the word bug or bus in it.  Wups, forgot about the 
&gt; &quot;sunbug&quot;....naaaa...it belongs to these people...Finch, Jason Cory 
&gt; INDIVIDUAL.  So, does that mean that he can sue vw cause they made a 
&gt; &quot;sunbug&quot;????
&gt; 
&gt; Now, if you look up the word &quot;volkswagen&quot;, that's a different story.
&gt; 
&gt; What about vw then?  Only 55 records and a lot are marked dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting note that &quot;vw trends&quot; trademark is marked &quot;dead&quot; and 
&gt; &quot;abandonded&quot;...wonder if they know that?  
&gt; Abandonment Date  February 25, 1992
&gt; 
&gt; Lot's of interesting stuff in there...&quot;Meyers Manx&quot; is still a valid 
&gt; &quot;live&quot; trademark!  
&gt;                     (APPLICANT) Meyers Manx CORPORATION CALIFORNIA PO BOX 
&gt; 1491 Valley Center CALIFORNIA 92082
&gt; 
&gt; I personally have a hard time believing that vwoa/vwag can go after anyone 
&gt; with the word bus or bug in their name.  Maybe after busbarn cause they 
&gt; displayed vw someplace they should not have.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
