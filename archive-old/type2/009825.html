&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; 	I've got a type IV, 1974 Bus that I will soon use for a month long
&gt; trip to Alaska.  Originally I was planning on rebuilding the engine
with
&gt; my father, but recently we have wondered if it would be better to
simply
&gt; purchase a rebuilt engine from GEX and install it ourselves.  I have
heard
&gt; few negative remarks about the company on this list already, and I was
&gt; wondering what the lists opinion on this engine rebuilder is.

I'm not a type 4 expert but, judging from my experience with GEX, if
they were the last rebuilder on the planet I'd install a Subaru.

You can do a lot better work yourself!
