Subject: Total Immersion (flood damage and buses)

Volks,

Over the past couple of weeks I have been dealing with the after-effects
of a flood as I posted back then.  I have learned a lot from the
experience and wanted to share.  Unless you are the victim of such a
disaster, this is very peripheral, but if you are, it is vital!

First, you should know that unlike modern cars, flooding is *not* a total
disaster for a bus.  If you have a carbureted bus, it is about a 4-6 hour
task to return the mechanicals to normal operating order, amazingly. With
an FI engine, you have a tougher row to hoe, but with the basic PC
components of the L-et suystem, I think you have a better than 50/50
changfe of getting it running again w/o replaceing everything.

Second the sooner you get to it, the better... BUT you must get to at
least the &quot;running engine&quot; stage in one go.  If you are not ready to
devote that much time, then it is, amazingly, better to leave the bus
submerged or at least not to futz with it until you are ready to have a go
all at once.  Water does *not* cause rust.  Oxygen causes rust, water only
promotes it.  A car submenrged in water will rust very slowly, a damp
engine exposed to air will rust in less than a day.

I intend to do a page on rehabbing a flood-damged engine eventually, but
for starters, let me show you what I am currently dealing with.  My
brother-in-law is a mechanic and owns a basement full of tools, all of
which were totally submenrged for some hours.  He has half, I have half
and we are racing to restoration.  &quot;Win conditions&quot; are number handled
with points for number restored to functionality :-)  Over time the number
that *remain* functional will add feathers to the cap of the victor :-)

What we are dealing with can be best exemplified by this circular saw:

I am 3/4 of the way thru this tonight (it was my &quot;before&quot; pic) and believe
it will run again.  All the bearings are semi-sealed, the coils on stator
and rotor are fine.  Clean it, oil it, replace the bearings (all standard
sizes) and you are good to go.

As I handle these tools from the 50s thru the 90s, I have to advise that
if your choices in buying tools are (a) anything from the 50s/60s, (b)
anything from the 80s/90s except very high end (Milwaukee, Snap-On, etc.),
or (c) very high end stuff...  I would go with (a), (c), then I would gnaw
my arm off before buying anything made lately for less than $100.  Sears,
Makita, B&amp;D, no matter what, it's *ALL* garbage!
