Dear Brian,

To give you an idea I have the following questions:
What size engine?
how many miles?
Have you done a compression test?
Will you need now heat exchagners and exhaust?
Is the batterytry still intact?
Has the front axle any wholes in it?
How much of the cluch is left?
etc.
How much play has the steering got?
To me the rust sound quite serious since usually a lot more will have 
gone that you have not found yet, so have a really good look.
Take a screw driver and poke all around the wheel arches etc.

I paid 800 Pounds for my 1979 2L bus with realatively little rust.
Still had to get two wheel arches and the sliding door welded.
Needed new clutch and brakes, shox etc. I can email you the excel 
file of part I had to buy.

I think 1500 sound s lot if you have to ready the camping conversion anyway.
Bargain hard since you will probably spend the same again to do it up properly!


Best of luck!
Email me if you have questions.

&gt;I am currently looking at a 1975 devon coversion camper but being new to
&gt;this i'm not quite sure what its worth.
&gt;     Mechanically its sound, the camping interior would have to be redone,
&gt;there are two small rusty holes either side of the front indicators, the
&gt;doorsteps in both front doors are bubbling with rust coming through, the
&gt;drivers side rear corner is quite bad but would probably to with patching
&gt;and not a whole new rear corner, the drivers side sill has been redone,
&gt;underneath it is fine, the paintwork is rough with a few other small ares
&gt;needing a rub done, the whole van would need a respray.
&gt;     The asking price is £1500 ( thats irish punts ) but i think this is to
&gt;much, i would appreciate any advice particularly from any one in Ireland or
&gt;England.
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Brian M
