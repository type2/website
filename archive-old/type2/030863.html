Good Grief, didn't have any idea the locks were a problem, within 24 hours
I got over 2 dozen requests for the rekeying info..... so here it is

-------

the below FAQ is based on the &quot;unlocking the mystery of VW locks by Dave
Hall.  then it is modified and based on my experience with my 78
type 2 so it's application to other years may or may not work, it should
but I have no evidence that it does apply to other years 

 Use the info at your own risk, 
-----------------------------------

   Exploded lock barrel All the Type 3 and Type 4 (and many Beetle/Bus
   too) door lock barrels are similar, but their overall size differs, as
   does the profile of the key (the grooves along its length).  This
   changed from time to time, to increase the possible number of key
   combinations.  For key profiles read the August 1997 Wolfsburg Wired
   from Wolfsburg West.


* removing the lock from the vehicle will not be covered here as it is
covered in many of the type 2 service manuals

   The barrel contains 8 pieces of brass with slots, called tumblers (9
   in the ignition switch barrel) and 8 (or 9) tiny springs to push them
   out.

(I have found that number of tumblers varies widely among vans
also the code is frequently missing or unreadable)
   
   Each tumbler has 0, 1, 2 or 3 notches on its end, which is a code
   telling you how long the cut out slot is (matching 1,2,3 and 4 in the
   picture).  The right key pulls in all the tumblers flush with the
   barrel, but the wrong key leaves some or all sticking out a bit, which
   prevents the barrel turning.  Check the diagram (from official
   manuals, thanks VW!) carefully, to see how the key shape matches the
   tumbler slots.
   
   This is the key (sorry!) to changing the tumblers to match your other
   locks.  Door locks are easy, and you can pull apart old barrels to get
   the right tumblers. 

grab a couple old locks from a similar bus to use for &quot;Spare parts&quot; so
that you have a supply of tumblers, if you are lucky you may just be able
to rearrange the ones you have.  also the tumblers are reversable so a 0
can be reversed to be a 4 etc

 According to VW, ignition and tail-gate barrels
   cannot be standardised. The latter are pinned in place and could be
   damaged by removal

I have found that the tailgate barrel of the van is fairly easy, it is the
sliding cargo door that is &quot;interesting&quot;.  I have never tried an ignition
key and don't reccomend it.

   If you need a key cut, your (long-established) VW dealer may have the
   code books to tell him what shape your key is from the number on the
   lock (stamped on the handle mechanism). after you change the tumblers
   this number will no longer be valid, so paint it out or something


this is a good article to start with, clean the parts up before proceeding

  Door-lock Overhaul 
  
                     from an article by Austin Blackburn, written in 1988
                                                                         
   Having been locked out, and finding how easily I could get into my
   locked Fastback using my neighbour's VW key, I decided to overhaul my
   locks.  The sequence of operations are:-
   
    1. Remove the door handle (one screw on mine, behind the door sealing
       rubber)
    2. Put the key in the lock to stop the tumblers falling out
    3. Remove the countersunk screw from the lock operating lever, and
       pull it off
    4. Remove the lock cylinder from the handle; take care of the plastic
       sealing ring
       
   Next inspect the machined hole the cylinder rotates in. Each side
   there should be a groove that the tumblers locate in when the key is
   removed. (On my handles there were deep grooves, indicating that the
   tumblers had been forced round in the vehicle's previous life). As
   there is no way to repair this damage, I was fortunate enough to find
   two new handles at VW Action, but good second-hand ones would suffice.
   
   The next problem I tackled was the lock cylinders themselves. Before
   removing the key, I cleaned up the exterior of the cylinder and made a
   note of the order of the tumblers. There are four different types,
   marked blank (no markings), I, II or III. Now having this information,
   I removed the key to allow the tumblers to fall out - they didn't,
   much to my surprise. The hang-up turned out to be simply the amount of
   grease and dirt on them. I removed each tumbler and spring, and washed
   them in methylated spirits, along with the barrel itself.
   
   Upon re-assembly, I stretched all the springs slightly, to make them a
   tighter fit in the handle. No oil or grease was used in the assembly
   as locks operate best without them. A dry lubricant such as graphite
   or molybdenum disulphide should be used.
   
   With this carried out the vehicle is now as secure as when it was new,
   at a minimal cost. Mind you, I am being very careful not to get locked
   out again.

------

ok now that the parts are clean lets proceed

before removing all of the tumblers insert the &quot;destination key&quot; (the one
you want it to work with after you are finished) into the lock, if it
won't go in, the key slots are different and this prochedure will not
work.  if it goes in note which tumblers are sticking out of the lock
barrel (either side) and which are totally retracted. 

the tumblers that are fully retracted do not have to be touched, leave
those alone.  now it becomes basically trial and error to find a tumbler
pin in your spare pile or other tumbler in the key barrel to replace the
ones that stick out of the barrel, do this until all of the tumblers
retract completely into the barrel when the destination key is inserted.

(NOTE don't work over a shag carpet, it is amazing how far those little
springs can fly!)

you have now rekeyed the lock. clean it good, lube it lightly and
reassemble back into your type 2.


The sliding cargo door is a bit tricky to get to the key barrel, to get to
it you need to.

.  remove the door handle assembly 
.  take the screw out from the back that holds the barrel in place
.  the barrel is swegged(sp) inside of the crome tube, fortunately this is
fairly soft metal and with some care the front crimp can be rolled back
enough to get the barrel out, be carefull there is a small plastic seal to
keep the water out under the top. 
.  once the barrel is removed it is rekeyed in the same manner as above
.  when satisfied reinsert the barrel into the chrome tube and VERY
CAREFULLY recrimp the top shut.
(practice on the donor lock)

reinstall back onto the van.

level of difficulty

.  ignition switch,  don't reccomend trying at all
.  passenger doors,  fairly easy
.  tailgate,  harder to get out, but once out fairly easy to rekey
.  sidedoor, fairly difficult to get to key barrel, but not impossible if
you are carefull and take your time (a spare chrome tube would be handy)


it took me about 6 hours to rekey all my doors the first time I did it,
now I can rekey a van in about 2.5 hours.  this is an all day job, or do
one lock at a time.  (it is better to work at a desk with a good light
too)


Hope this helps
good luck, secure those buses, westys and vans
