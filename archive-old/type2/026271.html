I used various combinations of penetrating oil, heat, grinder, vise
grips and air chisel to get them off (don't even bother trying to use a
spanner, leave it in the tool box).  Didn't have a nut splitter, this
would probably be a good idea if you can get it over the nuts.

&gt; Would it, for example, be  worth splitting the exhaust nuts off the
&gt; studs rather than even trying to undo them, since this would protect
&gt; the studs and I'm probably going to replace them anyway?
