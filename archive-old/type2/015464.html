&gt;I bought this thing over the internet a few months ago,  The van has sat
for the past 10 years with 
&gt;little use.

Any vehicle that sits unused for that period will require:

1. Pull the fuel tank screen and replace it. It could be restricting fuel
flow, and it will give you a chance to assess how much particulate is in
the tank. Verify the pressure and volume of the pump. The diaphrams in them
get hard from sitting and can crack and the valves can become contaminated
causing pressure/volume drop. Your running/idling problem could be buildup
of varnish or crud in one of the carb jets as well. Try a strong carb
cleaner and a 90lbs air blast to every teeny tiny hole you can find. Take a
strand of copper wire and poke through the holes in the throat. Blast again
with air. Then make sure the float weight and all adjustments are spec.
Sometimes, even this will not get the crud causing a problem.

2. Flush out and bleed all the brake fluid with fresh DOT 4. Prepare for
the possability of the new fluid acting as a solvent and loosening the
varnish and crud around the seals and leaks developing. With ten years
sitting through wet winters it is likely that the whole brake system will
need rebuilding, the master cylinder, calipers and wheel cylinders and
hoses within a short period of reuse. Watch for a problem with the calipers
not fully releasing. This can be caused either by gunk in the calipers or
swollen flex hoses. To be safe, service and adjust then monitor the brake
system closely for problems or leaks. Do this for sure. After flushing the
fluid, with the motor running to provide vacuum to booter, step on the
pedal as hard as you can. If a seal is going to blow, you want it to happen
in the driveway and not when the deer/dog/kid runs out in front of you.
Then find a very flat parking lot. Travel at 20MPH. With hands off the
steering wheel, apply light to moderate braking. The vehicle should come to
a stop without veering left or right and with no noises. This assumes the
tires are evenly inflated, matched size, wear and brand, balanced and the
bearings properly adjusted.
