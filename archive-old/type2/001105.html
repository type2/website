Subject: [T2] FI Has no power

I recently installed a 2.0L AVP w/ FI (factory tested and adjusted).  After
many weeks of painful troubleshooting, I was finally able to take the
vehicle for a test drive.

When I did, it had horrible power and could not handle any load.  All of the
books I have tell me to look for an air leak or a defective air flow meter.
Is this the right direction?

Any thoughts?

Thanks - Mike
