David,
In my 72 with 1800 P&amp;C's my head temp is about 220-290 F on the flat and level
_at_ 50 F outside.  It seems to fluctuate by about 25 degrees depending on if the
heater is on.  CHT goes up with heat on and down with heat off.  My oil temp
stays about 140 - 160 under the same conditions.
I've come to the conclusion that if my CHT stays below 350, I'm fine, and that
my oil isn't even working hard until it reaches 190.
I'm no temperature expert, but these are the temps I look for.

&gt;    I finally figured out how to hook up my temperature gauge and was
&gt; wondering what normal operating temperatures should be.  my temp on
&gt; semi flat terrain to stabilize _at_ about 225-230 F with about 30 degree out
&gt; side temperatures.
&gt;   Is this hot, cold or  normal.

&gt;   Thankyou,
