Subject: Re: [T2] More starter problems

Try the screwdriver across the two big terminals.  This should spin the
starter motor without engaging the solenoid; You might have hurt the
starter, but I kind of doubt it.  My bus got home the same way after the
pilot bearing went out in May, but I haven't put it all back together yet. I
can't say for sure that my starter still works, but I sure hope so :)
