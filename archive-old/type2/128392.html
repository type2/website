Subject: Stuck Drivers window

Hi Volks,

I've now got a stuck drivers side window (main window
not wing window). It's stuck half way down. The gears
feel worn off. How to I get at this part?  It seems so
inside the door that I'm not sure how to get at it.
Can this gear be relplaced? Is there a quick fix to at
least get the window rolled up shut?  Rainy season is
starting in Seattle! 

Bus is a 72

Please help.

Rae
