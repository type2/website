Yep, but it tastes terrible so use a cheap hand pump.

&gt;I really don't want to try to drain the oil again.  It is sitting on a 
&gt;dolly, and I would have to 'lift' the engine another 8 inches to get below 
&gt;it.

 Do you have any clearance to work with? You only need to loosen the screw, let it drain with your hand nearby and pop it back in. It's messy but one you start the bolt the oil will stop coming out.
