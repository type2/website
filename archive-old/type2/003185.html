&gt; I am looking for front and rear SIDE running lights/reflectors for our
&gt; two '71 buses.
&gt; They are pretty rare around the junkyards hereabouts.  Does anyone have
&gt; a source for new, used or whatever?


I stock the front and rear lenses for $9.95 each, and the rear assemblies
(lense not included) for $19.95 each. (These fit '70-79; I don't carry the
round reflectors used in '68-69.)  If you bought a pair of front lenses, a
pair of rear lenses, and a pair of rear housings, you'd have everything but
the plastic backing plates that the front reflectors attach.  These are not
a common failure item and I don't carry them, although if you couldnt use
your old ones or find a junkyard pair, you could use another pair of the
rear housings for the front.  They'd have bulb holders built in which you
wouldn't need (hence the $19.95 price) but would work.
