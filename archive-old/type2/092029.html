Subject: sliding door, and real cheap golf

Hey... It's getting to be time to have my sliding door fixed.  It's at 
the point where i have to hold it into the upper track and line up the 
front latch, then push the back latch closed to shut it.  It needs a 
lower track (and probably the metal that holds the track on) very badly. 
 So, I'm not a welder.  Should i just take this to any body shop to have 
it done, or do you think i should look for a vw place?  I'm in Buffalo, 
NY.  Only place I could think of is John's Bug Shop, but I don't know if 
they do that kind of work...
What do you think?

Also, my friend's dad bought a 1990 VW Golf last year, and it had a lot 
of problems, i put a head gasket on it, and other things.  In all, 
there's $1500 of new parts on the thing, and it still runs bad and 
stalls and things.  He wants to get rid of it.  Cheap.  P-mail me for 
more info....  tgtsfkncld_at_att_dot_net

thanks....
