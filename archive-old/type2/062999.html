Subject: Re: What year is my bus?

I think the person who told you you where wrong is wrong;&gt;) My 61 is not 
drilled on the pass side for a visor, and the cardboard is correct.

&gt; &gt; Ok, one more thing. I have a cardboard (very heavy) sun visor on ONLY
&gt; &gt; the driver side. It's bright blue with a large white VW emblem on the
&gt; &gt; inside side in the center. There are no holes drilled or anything for
&gt; &gt; the passenger side, and someone in the know today told me I am mistaken
&gt; &gt; about it being a '61.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He says that they only did that in '60, and that i have a '60. How do I
&gt; &gt; know? AM I wrong? Is he nuts? Are we all?? What other defining feature
&gt; &gt; or number code will resolve this? The title says '61, but it's been
&gt; &gt; quite an owned vehicle. The motor (laying on the ground behind things)
&gt; &gt; was from a '65 Bug, according to the numbers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I just looked at the guy, nodded like I knew what he was
&gt; &gt; talking about, and muttered &quot;Hmmmm&quot; and &quot;No kidding...&quot; a lot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks, again

&gt; The only way to be sure is to check the chasis numbers. VW changed
&gt; things in mid-year. Also, I'm not sure what year, the feds changed the
&gt; laws. VWs were sometimes titled at the time of sale, (at least in some
&gt; states). I remember reading a newspaper article about this when I was a
&gt; kid.
