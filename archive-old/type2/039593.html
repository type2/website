&gt;I've got two questions to ask::
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to add a full flow oil filter system to the bus' engine.
&gt;How is this possible, with the 68-70 engine mounting brace in place?
&gt;(I'm guessing it will obstruct the oil feed from the pump).

I must suggest that the 2.5 qt. capacity of the T-I motor takes so little
time to change, it is not even a one pint of Guiness job. Keep a 5 gallon
bucket handy for used oil reclaim, change the oil frequently and take the
money saved on jury riggin' the heart of your motor with an add on filter
and buy a round or 3 or 5 of Guiness for all your friends at the pub with
the savings in time/money.

Just don't Californicate your motor, particularly if you might use this
idea as an excuse to lengthen your oil change interval. That is a very
false economy. 

One parameter to consider. If you add 40% to oil capacity over stock, how
much longer will it take for your motor oil to reach optimum operation
temperature? 40% every time you start the motor cold for the now shortened
life of your motor. 

Another parameter to consider. If you add on a remote filter, how much oil
line lenght will be added? What is the friction loss and pressure drop from
stock? Was your oil pump designed for this extra load? No. What effect will
that have on pressure and volume at the bearings and every other item in
the motor that expects and needs more lubricant than is now provided? It's
not stock pressure and volume anymore, it is less than that, meaning less
engine life and sometimes a lot less.

Contact Gene Berg and see what they advise for add on filtration for a
street motor. If he has engineered a kit, it will be truly engineered to
account for everything most other kits don't even consider, but it will be
designed for extreme conditions of use, not street use in a stock motor,
and it will cost 3 times your FLAPS wizbang wannabe slap it on there and
see what happens kit. I don't even think they put an oil filter on their
300 hp racing variants of this motor. They just change the oil after every
run.

&gt;
&gt;And secondly. Is there some form of stolen car register I can check against
&gt;in California?
&gt;(I'm always a little paranoid about new purchases! I'm sure there's no need
&gt;though).

No, your not sure, or you would't ask the question. To be sure you must
verify.

Did you receive what appears to be a valid title? Yes, contact the DMV
(Dept. of Motor Vehicles) who issued it. No title, just a bill of sale?
There are factors here who can research your vehicle with the VIN stamped
on the chassis. Hemmings Motor News will list a dozen or more. But if the
evidence you have is sufficient to the licensing agency of your
jurisdiction, I would feel quite comfortable.

Keep an eye on the inevitable replys to this post who will attempt to
justify the wisdom of their add on wizbang and demand that I change my
opinion to validate theirs. They will have testamonials made of sand, not
data. Choose which ever opinion makes you feel warm and fuzzy.
