Subject: 68-72 Front Bumpers

Looking for a part with no luck, hopefully someone has a part number or
a vendor source, I have tried all of the usual places.

When you separate the front bumper between the middle blade, the left
step bumper blade and the right step bumper blade you will find a rubber
gasket or separator for the two ends of the middle blade. When I took my
bumper apart for painting my rubber separators crumbled.

I feel that these are needed to keep the bumper sections from rattling,
has any one ever put a bumper back together without them?

Also I'm finding not many of these bumpers had the bumper guards,
obviously this must have been an option because very few busses I see
have them, any thoughts?
Thanks
Meredith
