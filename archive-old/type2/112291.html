&lt;&lt; doesn't seem like too crazy of a proposition though to have a piece of
glass cut to fit the opening and then just shorten and glue back together
the side right rear seal to the right length and install as normal.

A tip from another list...If it's just flat automotive glass that you need to
have cut, find a glass shop that carries &quot;school bus&quot; glass. It's flat safety
glass that can be custom cut to your dimensions...reportedly fairly cheap,
too...YMMV, as always... ;-(
