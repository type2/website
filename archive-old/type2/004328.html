Importance: Normal

In my ongoing effort to see if I can get my 71 Westy to run cooler, last
night I removed and inspected the oil pressure relief valves.

This is a basically stock 1600DP, doghouse, dual relief case engine, with
about 40 to 50K miles since the last rebuild.  I recently installed a Berg
dipstick temperature switch, and found that the thing goes off whenever I
exceed 55 to 60 MPH. As soon as I drop below that speed, the light promptly
goes out.  There doesn't seem to be much relationship to ambient air
temperature.  I've got new manifold boots, new spark plug air seals, the
carb (Brosol 34 PICT 3) has about 30K miles since new, engine to body seal
is good, and all other cooling related items I can think of and easily
inspect are normal.

Both relief valve springs and plungers were whistle clean, and dropped out
easily when I removed the threaded plugs.

The oil cooler bypass relief valve (the one toward the pulley end of the
engine) did appear to hang up sometimes when I pushed it up into the bore
with my finger, but it otherwise moved freely in the bore.  It seemed
somewhat loose and wobbly in the bore, in fact.  I could feel some corrosion
in the lower part of the bore, but this was in the area occupied by the
spring and threaded plug.  The plunger had some vertical score marks on the
sides.

The oil pressure relief valve (the one toward the flywheel end of the
engine) moved freely in the bore.  I could feel some corrosion in the lower
part of the bore, similar to the bypass relief valve, but no tendency to
hang up and no score marks on the plunger.

So my questions are -

1. If the oil cooler bypass relief valve were to be open at an inappropriate
time, would the bypass of oil around the oil cooler cause overheating?

2. Should I replace the relief valve plungers and springs and do any other
maintenance on these items?  Where to get the required parts?

Your help is, as always, much appreciated.
