Thanks to all of you for the response in wiring from
hell. I test all the things that Don told me and
everything seem to be working normal. The same thing
happen with my old Batt. Once I charged works ok for
few weeks then quits. I can't fix what's not broken!
Gen and Regulator test OK. Any suggestions?
Thanks
PS. Sorry for the late response, I was out of town.
