Subject: headliner conversion

have any of you NON-westy bus owners (deluxes, hard-top campers, etc) 
ever replaced your ratty vinyl headliners with some westy-style wood 
(or masonite) paneling? i see there is a sort of ledge a few inches 
above the windowline, but it doesn't look like there is a slot or 
anything to hold the edge of a panel.
  still... could it really be as easy as putting a strip of glue on 
the ceiling and popping a panel in place, or am i missing something?
