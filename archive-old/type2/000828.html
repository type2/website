Hi bus-drivers,

Yesterday I wrote about a 'stutter' in my '77. I got several responses
(thank you). To condense all these responses in one sentence:

- Check/adjust/replace virtually all parts of the ignition system, might as
well rebuilt the carb and don't forget to check/adjust the valves.

So I have my work cut out for me. Since I've never done any of this I have
two options:

1 - Bring it into a shop and let them have a go at it.
2 - Spend all winter trying to do it myself (I don't drive it in winter
anyway).

Since I fear that when I bring it into a shop they WILL actually replace all
these parts (and charge me for lots of work), after which I find the problem
is still there, I am tempted to try option number 2 and gain some experience
along the way. I still have option number one open if I fail.

The first thing I am going to do is check for obvious loose wires, gap the
points and replace the condenser.
Some people wrote that condensers hardly ever fail. However from my
electronics background I know that old condensers have a tendency to 'arc'
inside. The dielectricum (sort of insulation) will momentarily short circuit
after which it recovers again. Since condensers are cheap I might as well
put a new one in.

But I'll begin by repairing the exhaust which came loose. I'll try to weld
up the old one and leave the new one on the shelves as the old one does not
seem to be in too bad a condition. It's just that one of the inlet pipes
came loose (caused by the 'after-burning' in the exhaust?). Well, we'll see
when I have it off.
