They are not, i wanted two tailpipes on my '73 1600, i removed the 
stock pressed on outlet on the muffler, cut a hole where the other 
pipe would be on a Bug, and welded on two 2&quot; thick wall pipes on it, 
when i started that engine it sounded as if it had a loose head 
or a piece of cylinder blown out, the sound disappeared when 
i pressed a rag against the right tail pipe, it seems that the 
gasses are routed differently in the different mufflers, i ended up 
grinding the right pipe back off and welding a plate over the hole :]
