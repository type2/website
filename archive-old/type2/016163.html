If you cut the gasket away the window should fall off right into your hands.
If your not careful it will fall off right onto the ground.  I cut mine on
the top and sides first to keep this from happening.  Don't force, pull, or
pry it or you may crack it.  Just make certain you have cut all the gasket
away and it pops right out.  Good Luck.

Subject: [T2] Window removal 


Does anybody have a how-to to remove the windshield WITHOUT breaking the 
window? I plan to put it back in after the restoration. I'm not worried 
about the gasket as it's going to be replaced anyway. I was cutting into the

gasket down the middle of it where the edge of the glass stops inside. Looks

like it should just pop out after that. Am I doing it right or is there a 
better/easier way?
