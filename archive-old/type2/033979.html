Subject: RE: [Re: Anyone have an accelerator cable for a '77 automatic bus?] 

&gt; &gt; again, altogether, with feeling:
&gt; &gt; http://www.busdepot_dot_com/ASP/SearchProdId.cfm?ProdId=211+723+555+

&gt; that part number  211-723-555 is correct for the AUTOMATIC only 76+
&gt; the manual transmission accel part number is 211-723-555AA, the manual
&gt; tranny cable is 3458mm long, while the auto tranny cable is 2870mm long.


There seems to be some confusion whether the original inquiry was about an
auto or manual trans. Either way I've got you covered. The 211 723 555 is
for an automatic, and it runs $12.95. I normally try to keep one in stock (I
sell maybe one every six months; not exactly a hot mover), but don't have
one at the moment.  However my distributor does, so you're looking at maybe
a week for me to get it depending on when you place the order.  (Call me if
possible; my order from that distributor goes in tomorrow.)  If this is an
absolute emergency I might be able to get them to dropship one faster than
that, epecially if there is more than the one item on the order; asking them
to dropship a $10 part would be calling in a real favor, which I don't like
to do too often or they'll get sick of me. :-)  The correct part number for
the manual cable is a 211 721 555AA, not a 723, and I sell those all day
long for $3.95.
