Subject: Re: oiling systems, inverted running.

Nice post Bill!

BAS in Germany supplies beautifull dry sump systems/kits,
they use an aluminum tank which can be opened and has a 
removable sort of bucket for easy cleaning, The tank fits 
very nicely behind a Bug's rear seat, and it even looks 
nice, it's maybe about 10 liters they have a very nice 
double oil pump, same principle as the auto stick shift
pump, but a lot bigger, it's the biggest VW oil pump i've 
ever seen, i even wonder if it would fit behind a stock 
or stock dimensioned aluminum pulley, i'm pretty sure it
interferes with the pulley tin. one front half of the pump 
acts as the main oilpump, supplying oil to the bearings,
the rear pump is the scavenge pump, i don't recall having 
seen a ready made sumpplate with drain to connect to the 
scavenge pump, but i'm sure it's either available or 
easily made. 

I can see using the pump would se more Hp to turn the bigger
and double amount of gears, there's also the added weight,
warm up time is longer too, there's a little Hp gained 
cause the cam gear doesn't sling that much oil around any 
more and the crank does not have to wrestle through the
oil bath. 

This leaves a coule of questions, how does the cam gear get
lubricated? Will one need to file slots in the sides of
the rods to increase oil spray towards the cylinderwalls/
pistons? What i also miss is the oil that flows in and out 
of the heads, all oil that flows into the heads and back
into the sump will help cool the heads, it'll transport
heat. What about the distributor drive?

Brian.
