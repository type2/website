&gt; Coupla stiff 8-ply light truck tires on the front wheels make a world of

Michael:
At risk of starting another FART, I'd basically second that, but say
that you should have the same type tires on all 4 wheels. A friend from
Germany tells me that there it is ILLEGAL to have two different BRANDS
of tires on a car, let alone types of tire.
The first type 2 I owned was a 76 that had had an engine fire; I tried
to test drive it after repairing the damage, and was HORRIFIED at the
handling. A slight application of logic suggested that this thing would
never have got off the dealers' lots when new, so I got out the owner's
manual and looked up tires. It says there specifically: REINFORCED
(1976)! Local tire stores were totally in the dark, the midwest not
being exactly type 2 heaven. So I mail ordered a set of Kleber
reinforced from some warehouse on the east coast. The difference was
truly amazing- at least as much difference as between 40 lbs inflation
and 18lbs!
I think my favorite tires have been Avon VAN  (load range d), but my
supplier doesn't have them anymore.
I drove my old 78 with the big bores and big heads at 85 indicated
cruising for HOURS and I'd had the speedo needle at nearly where 100
should be for glorious bursts, and NEVER slowed down for crosswinds.
I'll be the first to agree that loafs are twitchier than Vanagons, but
with the right tires, inflation and good shocks, they're not scary.
