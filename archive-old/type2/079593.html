Subject: oil leak

HI Folks,
	I have an oil leak coming down at the cylinder-head interface on
the number 4 cylinder.  It is a steady drip, clean unburned oil.  I pulled
the push rod tubes on that side and checked their seals and tube
integrity-all good.  The oil is coming from above the tubes. I pulled the
bottom and between cylinder tin and I can see oil on the sides of the fins
above. The engine isn't smoking, makes good power.  California emissions
cat exhaust, stock engine in 1983 vanagon.  Before the leak it used &lt;1qt
in 1000miles. jon
