Chuck stated.....

&lt;&lt;    I've got a 69 bus in need of a tranny.  I have called around 
to local dealers and they want anywhere from $595 to $495 
rebuilt with a $200 core.  To $275 used $150 core.  This seems 
a little high does anyone have any advice on this?  &gt;&gt;

How much do you think it should cost?  First off you have the new 
parts from bearings to synchros to gaskets to take into account.  
And then you have the time required to properly do the job.  I'm not 
talking about slamming it out the door here but inspecting each 
and every used part of the gearbox.  On any rebuild, especially on 
one that the transaxle is now 30 years old, there will be parts that 
are too worn to be reused.  If you do not install new components 
then, obviously, you're going to install a good quality used part.  
Now, ask yourself, where did that used part come from?  Did the 
rebuilder buy it from a supplier or did they spend the 2+ hours or 
so to fish one out of a core unit?  And how much did that core
trans cost the rebuilder?  I'll bet that with talking to the customer,
unpacking the old unit, tearing it down for cleaning and inspection, 
reassembling with new (and good used) parts, boxing and shipping, 
and so on, I'll have anywhere from 10-14 hours tied up with an early 
002 job.  I'll have from $225-$275 in new parts/gaskets/seals in 
each 002 so I gross right around $300+/- on each one.   (I sell my 
002s for $600 exch.) So, for 14 hours and $300 gross that works 
out to about $21.43 per hour for this job.  Out of that gross I pay 
taxes and the rest of the goodies for being self-employed.  After
Uncle Sam takes more than his fair share I see around $12-$14 
an hour profit. 

To answer the question-No, I don't think that $600 is to much to
ask for a quality rebuild on a 002 trans.   

&lt;&lt; What should I look for it I take the used one?  I don't wanna 
buy it and get screwed because it has seized or doesn't work.&gt;&gt;

On a 30 year old gearbox?  Does it engage all gears easily and are
there chunks on the drain plug magnet?  Thats about it from an
external viewpoint.  You can't tell if the sliders are too worn to keep
it from popping out of gear, or if the ring and pinion is worn to the 
point that it'll be noisy, or anything else internal.  Your used trans
for $275 are the units that I'll pay $50 for to use as a core.
