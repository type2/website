Subject: Re: [T2] Those darn lights

Melissa,

Here are some hints on tracking the power thru the brake and rear turn
signal circuits:

First, brake lights...  Go to

http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-77-78-key-right.jpg

for the wiring diagram and indices.  Look for brake lights in the indices,
and you will see it near the top of the key-right page.  The index tells
you that the diagram for the brake light switch is in current tracks
57-60, so go to the diagram and look at current tracks 57-60.  These
diagrams read from top to bottom.

1) Starting at fuse 11, you have 3 black wires and a black/yellow wire.
   the black/yellow wire is for the horn, so we can ignore that one (tho
   if your horn works, it says that the fuse is good :)

2) one black wire runs over to the dual circuit warning light (the &quot;B&quot;
   light near your speedometer), the other two run down to the brake light
   switches on the master cylinder.  Let's ignore the dual circuit warning
   light for now and jump to...

3) the brake light switches. power runs into the switch on the black wire
   and out on a black/red wire.  That black/red wire runs back into the
   bus, to a 8-point multiconnector under the dash.

4) from the multiconnector, a black/red wire runs in the main harness to
   the rear of the bus and the rear corner light housings.

The places to check for power are:

1) fuse 11, tho if you have a horn, that fuse is good. (12v, when ignition
   is on)
2) the black wire at the brake switch plugs (12V when ignition is on)
3) the multiconnector (12V when ignition is on and pedal is pressed)
4) the bulb housings and sockets.

For the turn signals, go back to the index and look for turn signals.  The
rear left is on track 47, the rear right is on 51.  Go to the diagram and
look at tracks 47 and 51. Note that you are looking for a black/white and
black/green wire.  Since your front signals are working, everything above
the connector marked &quot;T3a&quot; is fine.  Find that connector! It is under the
dash and the wires running into it come from the turn signal switch, the
front turn signal housings and the big bundle of wires that goes to the
rear of the bus.  Check for power there and at the rear lamp housings.

I am headed for Annapolis and Pat Flynn's place tonight, then off to EB,
so I will not be around 'til Monday, alas.

                           Steve Dolan
