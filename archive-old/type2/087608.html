Subject: deadhead etc bussi and fuses

&gt; they werent even the same KIND of fuses that vw used... they
&gt;were the cylindrical glass ones with the metal inside...

these are actually better. vw used the other kind because they were cheaper.

gbc 8 and gbc16 buss fuses are far superior to the ceramic (or plastic!)
and copper foil crapola that comes in the bus. they have the proper pointy
ends, won't corrode at the tip and give you phantom electrical gremlins ,
and won't spit molten metal on your legs when they blow.
the problem is getting flaps to order them, but if you look around they are
available. maybe two bits pricier than the ceramic ones and worth it.
