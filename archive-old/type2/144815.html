&gt; &gt; For a household radiator, do yourself a favor, and have it powdercoated.
&gt; &gt; As long as it's freshly sandblasted this would be the best in the long

&gt; efficiency of the heat transfer...?-(

On a relatively low temperature steam radiator, not at all.  The big
problem would be in making sure all the nooks and crannys get coated. If
you miss somewhere, rust streaks are inevitable.

Exactly what is the steam source in your bus?  :)
