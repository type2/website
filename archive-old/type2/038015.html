Hey y'all.
I received a lot of suggestions to try a 64-72 bus rear window seal
shortened to fit.  I had already tried it once and couldn't make it go.
I tried again today after thinking the installation through a couple
hundred times.  They do work, although not nearly as well as the correct
gasketing.

I received a couple leads from across the pond and am waiting for the
mail to make it over and back again.  I  also got several leads from
various folks suggesting various gasketing manufacturers and I'm
pursuing that as well.

I will continue the search and when I find the right stuff I'll post it.

Thank you all for your help!
Dave
