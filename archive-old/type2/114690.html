Subject: Fall Tour &amp; Friday Haiku

Hi volks,

The fall colours tour rolls out of Darlington Ontario Canada tomorrow 
at 9:30 AM. We're meeting up at the corner of Courtice Rd and the S. 
Service Rd, exit #425 on the 401, and just a short distance from the 
gates of Darlington Provincial Park. Please make sure you have a full 
tank of fuel.

The tour will follow 50MPH 2-lane roads all the way to Wolfe Island, at 
a distance of 160 miles. There is no cost for the tour because nothing 
is included. Camping fees at Wolfe Island will run you $25CDN, and the 
Canadian ferry crossings on the route are free.

Bus Volks from eastern Ontario and upstate N.Y. are welcome to join us 
at the campground, they can take the ferry from Cape Vincent. We  
expect to arrive at the campground sometime near 6PM. Sunday Morning we 
will be having Breakfast Burritos before hitting the road back towards 
Toronto at 10AM. Please bring a burrito ingredient if you are going to 
join in the meal.

More questions? Visit the tour website:

Still need a detail I missed? Call my cell: (416) 735-1236. Right now 
there are 6 buses confirmed.

See you there!

Here are some Haiku from &quot;The_Bug_Pack&quot;, a local bus list with members 
that are attending the tour:

&gt; Eager bus pilots
&gt; flaunt the precipitation
&gt; The route is worthwhile.

&gt; type two veedub's
&gt; run better in the dampness
&gt; wear raincoats, people.

&gt; load the van, kiss wife
&gt; &quot;see you on sunday&quot; he says
&gt; wrath upon return

&gt; Rain falls, hopes not lost
&gt; &quot;pack the van we're goin' anyways&quot;
&gt; Fun's not always where it seems.

&gt; Frosty start, warm day
&gt; Rolling tires mean smiling face
&gt; Hey Rivers, slow down!

&gt; Busses are red
&gt; and yellow too
&gt; If you miss the fall colors
&gt; you'll really be blue.
