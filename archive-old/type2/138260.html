&lt;&lt; You do have lots of options. FI was installed on the Type 3 cars, so
&gt; the manifolds and such are around. Same heads, right? Same intake
&gt; ports? Some mickey mousing will be required to get the Jetronic style
&gt; on there, but shouldn't be too bad. &gt;&gt;

Have two extra Bosch Fuel Injection Systems books...Covers
D-Jetronic, L-Jetronic, LH-Jetronic,
LH-Motronic, K-Jetronic, and KE-Jetronic...Brand new (no
fingerprints... ;-)
