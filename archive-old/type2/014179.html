Subject: Re: [T2] New to list.

I'd take a few extra days and make some local trips not too far from a
prominent 
Brisbane WV mechanic.
If everything checks out just pack some food, water, Fosters in the ice
box (tall cans) , extra liter or so of petrol and a few extra liters of
engine oil. Best to get 20/50 or straight 40 wt.
Check to be sure your spare is good, get a cheater arm for your lug
wrench or check that you can get the wheel lugs off.
When you get ready to pass another car be certain that you've made an
appointment to do so.
Thats it, don't be paranoid.
AIRS in in Australia too, I think.
As for the type of engine, ask the guy that sold it to you.

&gt; Hi all, I am new to the list and thought I should make myself known. 
&gt; My name is Paul Shurvell, and I live in Darwin in the Northern 
&gt; Territory, Australia. I am currently in the process of buying my 
&gt; first T2 bus, a 1974 camper. This will be my first aircooled VW (I 
&gt; have owned a '79 Golf GLD in the past), The bus is in Brisbane, and 
&gt; I fly out on Monday to go and pick it up. What I would like to know 
&gt; is what sort of spares should I carry for the trip (3500km, what is 
&gt; likely to go wrong, and what I should check before I leave? The 
&gt; engine has been rebuilt within the last 2 years byso it should be ok,
however, I can't say as 
&gt; much for the rest of it. Another thing I would like to know is how 
&gt; do I tell what capacity the engine is just by looking at it (is it 
&gt; stamped somewhere?). I know that this is prety basic stuff and has 
&gt; probably been covered on the list a hundred times, but as I am new 
&gt; to this I hope you will all induge me!
&gt; Regards to all, Paul Shurvell.
