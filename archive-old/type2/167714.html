&gt; &gt; officially they are no longer used, however some heads (including AVP)
&gt; &gt; require them to function properly,  my rule of thumb has been if they
&gt; &gt; had gaskets uuse gaskets and if they didn't have gaskets then don't
&gt; &gt; use any.
&gt;
&gt; Why is that?  I just got new AVP heads and saw no recommendation to use

Call AVP and ask them about it, I put heads on then called em and had
to take em off and put in gaskets.   gave em a piece of my mind for
not putting a notice in that you need gaskets, looks like they
haven't change their ways
