Subject: [T2] what else to check?

Hello all,

 I dropped the motor from my bus today, getting ready to replace the rear
main seal. I've ordered new seals for the oil cooler and while I have the
motor out, I'm going to check the torque on the new head that was installed
a couple of months ago.

 The questions I have is: what else should I check while the motor is
dropped?

 Being hyd lifter illiterate, are you suppose to hear lifters tapping like
on non hyd systems?

Thanks in advance!
