Subject: Compression test &amp; Valve adjustment

Hey all,

checked the compression on my 78 2l, hyd. engine.
Cyl:
1 - 55 psi
2 - 90 psi
3- 60 psi
4- 120 psi

Strange readings.  none of the plugs looked bad at all.
procedure: Warm engine, new oil change, pulled all 4 plugs, disconnected
the injectors, screwed guage into each cylinder one by one.  I had to
turn the ignition and then go back to the engine to check the readings
so i could'nt tell if the pressure &quot;built up&quot;  I let the engine turn
over about 4-5 times on each cylinder.
The one thing I did not do was hold the throttle wide open.

So question:
can adjusting the valves greatly affect the compression?  I am getting
ready to adjust them &amp; will then re-check the compression. Then I will
squirt 1 tblsp of oil into each cylinder &amp; check it again.

I am planning on buying an AVP longblock, I just want to insure that
this engine has met the end of it's 'useful' life.

A friend said that w/ 2 cylinders that low (55 &amp; 60) he doubted that the
bus would even start.  Well, it has the stock FI &amp; I checked the timing
- dead on- but I have been experiencing starting problems.  The engine
will spin w/ out starting sometimes.  Related?

Here I go to the garage.
