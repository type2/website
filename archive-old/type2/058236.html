One of two things.  The black wire with the fuse that hooks to your coil
is the power line for the reverse lights.  If there is a short-to-ground
after the reverse switch, it would ground this wire, thereby robbing all
the electricity to the coil...

On the other hand, if it is hooked to the OTHER side of the coil (id:
condensor side) then when that reverse light kicked in, it'd most lightly
steal enough juice you'd no longer fire....

one of those..:)
