Subject: Re: [T2] Weber ICT34 jets and fuel tank sender replacement

Hi Eric,

Were the manifolds for a single or dual port upright?  I was watching an 
auction for some ICT's recently, and the pic showed SP manifolds.  Wondering 
if it was the same auction!  If they are singles, I would be interested.  If 
anybody else out there has single port manifolds for a 1600, and you don't 
need them anymore, could you contact me?  Thanks all.

	Eron




Two unrelated questions:

First, I'm about to replace my good ol' Weber progressive with a pair of 
Weber
34 ICTs I picked up of the unnamed auction site. The 34s came off a 
dual-port
upright (I even have the manifolds if anyone is interested in them). Should 
I
expected to have to reject these puppies? If so, anybody have the jet sizes
handy?

Second, I saw a site a few months ago that detailed how to cut a port in the
bed area about the fuel tank to give access to the fuel guage sender without
removing the tank. Does anybody remember that site? I need to replace/repair
my sender but don't want to drop the engine if I can avoid it.

-Eric
