&gt; I love the aftermarket ones that are in my 68 bus.
&gt; They are made of a thick, flexable, black textured
&gt; plastic. You don't have to wory about
&gt; breaking/creasing them when you have to remove them.
&gt; Does anyone else have ones like these? I would
&gt; recomend them to anyone in the market.
