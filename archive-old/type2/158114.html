Subject: Turn Signal Switch 72 Bus

List-
The turn signal switch on my 72 bus has failed.  Bus Depot tells me  
that the switch is backordered and has been for a long time.  The 72  
bus has a switch that is 72 only.
I took the switch apart to glue the broken part but don't think I can  
get it back together.  Will another year switch work? Does anyone  
have a solution to this problem?
Thanks,
John Ingram
