&gt; We both brought our latest busses &amp; his first in Dec 97' both with a

better buy.

&gt;I drove his van- WOW,  Now I know! :-
&gt; 
&gt; No brakes, well pull the Em brake _ALL_ the way out &amp; they make a nice
&gt; grinding noise.
&gt; 
&gt; No steering! The wheel can turn 90 degrees before the wheels start
to turn.
&gt; 
&gt; No Mirrors, LHD with no mirrors, on a RHD 3 lane road = PANIC
&gt; 
&gt; Engine stalls EVERY time you stop or use the clutch, which only
bites in the
&gt; last 1/4&quot; of travel &amp; then is SO violent that I kept hitting my head
on the
&gt; unit behind.
&gt; 
&gt; Realy, this bus is TOTALLY UN-road worthy. I wanted to stop &amp; leave
it at
&gt; the side of the road, but the BA6 &amp; warm feet beckoned me on for the
&gt; journey, only 5 miles, but the most stressful ever. Amazingly this
bus has
&gt; been like this since it  was sold to him by a Popular VW dealer
(ARCHIES in
&gt; London - Hope your reading you SH!T) who has sold a death trap &amp;
probably
&gt; still does.

Amazing that this can happen where there is stringent vehicle
inspections, isn't it!  This example shows the folly of thinking that
mandatory inspections can yield increased levels of vehicle safety. 
There's always a crook out there who will pass any rolling pile of junk.

The final arbiter of safety in a bus is _the driver_.  While the
dealer involved in this sale is obviously derelict in their duties,
the real blame lies with the customer who drove away from that dealer
knowing full well the hazardous nature of the vehicle (it's kind of
hard to hide a bad steering box and brakes!)

Sounds like you're doing the right thing to fix this bus, but once
this is done why sell it?  Sounds like it will be a good ride once the
mechanicals are put right.
