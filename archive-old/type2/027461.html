just to follow up on my post yesterday.  I was having some idleing problems 
and turning up the idle wasn't working, all plugs checked, no vacuume leaks. 
  and I also had a small oil leak between the distributer and the case.

My idle problem was the clogged idle jet.  for those of you who don't know, 
its on the right side of the carb by the generator and all you have to do is 
blow out the gunk with an air gun.  Works great.

Also the distributer &quot;pinch bolt&quot; was stripped(this is the one that goes 
completly around the base of the distributer).  So that was also replaced 
which stopped the leak.

My mechanic retimed everything and adjusted the carb.

Obviously the clogged idle jet was not covered in the warrenty.  Ah well,

Cost me about 30 bucks and he told me my clutch was adjusted 5 turns to 
much...EEEK!  of course he slapped my hand and said never do that again!

Gosh, you'd think i'd be able to adjust the clutch by now :)

Thanks all.

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
