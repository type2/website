Subject: BN4 removal heating channel/system

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I starting to remove the BN4 in my 71 westy and have a couple of general =
questions.  I have found where T connector in the fuel line is and can =
easily reach but do not know what size straight connector tube I should =
replace it with?  Should these be clamped after I put in a straight =
connector?  Can the switch be done without draining the gas tank.=20
    Also I am going to pull the fan and give it good cleaning and was =
wondering if there is a way to clean the heating  channel/system?
Any advice is appreciated
Steve
