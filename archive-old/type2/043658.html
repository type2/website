&gt; Yes!  I believe Magnesium burns at about 1800 degrees.

In the aircraft biz they keep buckets of sand around to dump on magnesium
fires.

One impressive demo done by science teachers is to light magnesium powder
on fire, then seal it between two slabs of dry ice.  The fire will
continue as the magnesium is such an active metal that it will wrench the
oxygen from the CO2 molecules.  When the magnesium is consumed, you are
left with a lump of carbon.
