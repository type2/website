Subject: Fake chrome, anyone?

Hi All,
     In putting our '70 bus back on the road, I'm faced with a 
delimna... My wife and I both really love the chrome which goes around 
the beltline of our bus, but many pieces of it are missing, and of the 
remaining ones, most are too distorted to be useful.
    What I'm wondering is if anybody has ever used the fake chrome 
stripes like you see on new automobiles--you know, the ones made out of 
plastic and have a very strong adhesive backing on them.
    I'm thinking these will probably be every bit as good looking as the 
original, and far more durable, and (most importantly?!?), cheaper than 
obtaining good replacement chrome.
    What are your thoughts on this?
    Has anybody ever done this?
    Anybody know of a company who supplies fake chrome stripping in the 
sizes which would be appropriate for our early buses?

To give you an example of the type of chrome I'm talking about, have a 
look here:

Thanks for ya'lls time.
