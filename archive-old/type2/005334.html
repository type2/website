Subject: [T2] Weber carbs for a Type 4 engine


&gt;
&gt; I would like to ask the collective wisdom of the list about the difference
&gt; between the Weber Progressive and the IDF 40s.
&gt;
&gt; Mine is a 1973 Bus with an entirely stock Type 4 engine. It currently has
&gt; Solexs on it. It has been recommended my most everyone I talk to that
&gt; switching to Webers will improve the overall performance of the bus.
&gt;
&gt; I believe there are three options -- from Weber -- for me to consider; IDF
&gt; 36s, IDF 40s or a Progressive. I would like to know the pro and cons of
&gt; each.
&gt;
&gt; The bus is a daily driver. My daily commute involves climbing over the
Santa
&gt; Cruz mountains (Hwy 17 for those who know) to get into Silly Cone Valley
&gt; each day. I'm not looking to turn it into a high performance machine. But
I
&gt; wouldn't mind improving the performance when I can.
&gt;
&gt; I don't work on the engine myself. All the engine work is professionally
&gt; done. The shop I take the bus to likes the Progressives and the IDF 40s.
&gt;
&gt;
