Hey, Type2 sisters and brothers,

For a very different perspective, the December 1998 issue of VolksWorld 
has a comparison between the Devon Moonraker and their recently restored 
1973 Westfalia. Pages 26-29.

To get to the article, though, you have to get past the stretched and 
lowered Splittie on the cover.

&gt;From the top of the food chain,

Mark Hineline
