Could anyone on the list that is now, or has in the past, used a Mark 
Stephens Stage 1 eng. please send me your comments on the same. I'm going to 
put a new eng. in my ' 78 westy this spring and was thinking about going with 
the Stephens, but wanted to get some other opinions before jumping in. BTW, 
the eng. is now a stock 2.0L FI hydrolic, and I would like to stay with this 
displacement.
Thank you all in advance,
Stray
