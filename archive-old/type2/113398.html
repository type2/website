Subject: Odd vacuum problem

For the last 8 months my bus has run like a top but the other day it started to run rough in the morning. I put a new temp sensor II in the head back in February and it smoothed out the warmup but now it's running worse.

After ignition, the idle is about 950rpm thanks to the AAR but after it closes the idle drops to about 680rpm and the engine starts to run rough.

I put on my Steve Dolan cap and low rise jeans ;-) and hooked up a vacuum gauge and sure enough the vacuum had dropped to 15&quot; from the normal level of between 17&quot; and 18&quot;.

What's odd is that by the time I get to work the rpms are back up to 875 and the vacuum is back up to normal. I verified this yesterday but adjusting the idle rpm and it went to 1100 by the time I got to work. I set it back to normal after.

This morning I decided to do a little investigation and I noticed that the rpm increased when I plugged the plenum and the line going to the fuel pressure regulator: the vacuum went back up to 17&quot;.

It appears I have a leak but as the engine warms up the leak goes away. If I park for 30 minutes the engine runs fine next start but if I wait 4-6 hours it's back to running rough again at startup.

Any clues why this leak seems to be temperature related?
