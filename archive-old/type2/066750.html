Rodney is correct -

There are two fans (optional) that fit into the cold air conduits.

They go into the horizontal metal tubes that are below the dash at about fuse 
box level; there are even removable panels in the pipe for fitting them. 

I imagine that they would help considerably with fresh air in the back of bus's
with the extra ducting accross the door.
