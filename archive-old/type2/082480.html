Subject: ECU questions

greetings,

i have a question about ECUs. i have a 76 Westy, i
plan to replace the 76 engine with a 78 engine, i also
have a 79 engine just sitting,which i plan to use as a
core. is the ECU from either if these engines(76 or
79) usable with the 78 (i am buying a longblock so i
will need to put on everything else). also how can i
tell if an ECU is any good before i install it? is
there a way? thanks in advance!
