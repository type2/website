Subject: Re: [T2] oil psi

I would be very careful about overtorquing though, as this one would be a
bear to fix if the threads 
stripped or the sender snapped off.
--------------------------------------
I'm a pessimistic fellow. I've found that many oil sender ports (on 20+
year old vans)  have already been mutilated with 1/8&quot; NPT senders or
adapters. If it won't tighten just get an NPT adapter and put your sender
in it.
