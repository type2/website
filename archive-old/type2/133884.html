Subject: 1600 tuning

I am trying to tune my friends bus. Its a 71 with a new engine from CA. Short 
block, we put the original bits and pieces, but new 34 pict carb and a 009 
dizzy, what should the timing be set at and what is the best way to set the carb 
so that there is no black smoke, thanks Dylan
