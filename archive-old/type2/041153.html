Subject: Flea Foggers in buses

I have recently seen tiny little termite-like bugs in my bus. The last time
I saw anything like this was back in the '70s in a Corolla. In fact, I
thought these bugs only lived in T*yotas. ;-)

These dudes are really small. You can be looking at one and not really even
see it. If they hadn't been on my dash, I wouldn't have even noticed. I saw
only a few, but as memory serves, they live in large colonies. At any rate,
I figure the 10+ years my bus sat in a junkyard probably brought these
dudes about. Problem is, they're eating something or they wouldn't be
alive. I fear they're eating the foam padding or horsehair or wood or
something I'll need later on.

Anyone ever try a magical mystery fogger in their bus? I'm guessing I'd
need to remove all power (battery) to prevent explosion, but I'm a little
afeared about other dangers such as over-saturation and smelling like the
Orkin man for the next 3 months.

Good advice always appreciated. Please p-mail smart-*ss comments as it's no
longer Friday. I'll read them all though...and appreciate most of them. :)

Thanks! Joe
