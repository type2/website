&gt; And a personal thanks to Mr. Dolan, for that gem about the clutch cable.
&gt; Mine is 26 years old. I'm going to get a new one, put it in place as a
&gt; preventive measure, and carry the old one as a spare. That way, I don't
&gt; have to risk having the sun in my eyes at 6am......nice warm shop, lift,
&gt; etc.   And maybe the old cable will even acquire antique value among
&gt; collectors, as the years go by.

I subscribe to the other philosophy, that which says that any part that
has been serving for two decades is less likely to fail than an unknown
new part.  Having had new clutch cables fail in the first few days of
service, I don't change one that is working well!

Changing a clutch cable on the road isn't all that tough, as long as you
have the correct part!
