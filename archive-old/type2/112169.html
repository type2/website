Subject: what to do 69 bus w/tranny blues

Hello,
 
Ijust got a good engine installed in my 69 transporter and the transmision went. I'm on a tight budget. I either have to sell the bus or get a good deal on a transmission.I'm capable of doing the install but I'm also very busy so would consider paying to have it done if the cost is reasonable. Any info would be helpful. I'm in California in the Bay area.
