Subject: RE: [T2] Continental Vanco-8 tires

&gt;-----Original Message-----
&gt;From: Rob Henley
&gt;Also has anyone tried using the 205 (27&quot; diamater) tires?

That's what I have on my '78 now and they handle well, are quite, and were
great in the snow last winter.......

But as I'm almost finished &quot;westfakiaing&quot; my bus I'm looking at these weight
issues vary seriously!!!!!!!
