Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection System Cleaning

Michael,

It was made to go into an engine environment.

I have used everything from 409 to simple green, to parts cleaner
on mine.

*not* brake fluid or MEK or any of the stuff that melts paint!

Skip the water, just spray it on and use a wet cloth to wipe.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; has a lot of Guck around it and I want to know what others may have used to 
&gt; clean it. I don't want to corrode it, or melt the wire casings. Would this 
&gt; be a place for mild soap and warm water? Water a bad idea? Simple Green, 
&gt; Purple Power, Clorox? TIA.
