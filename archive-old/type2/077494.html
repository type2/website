Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

Yeah, the more feedback I get...  the more I think I'll just weld a new roof
into that hole.  It will be some work, but not as much as the sunroof it
seems.  :-)

&gt; &gt; ragtop measures out to just fit in, I still may just weld a new patch in
&gt; &gt; place of the hole.  Sounds like the water issue may be more trouble than
I
&gt; &gt; can stand.   Thanks again everyone for the help.
