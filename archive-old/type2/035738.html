Hell, if you were a REAL scrounger, you'd just measure and make some up
yourself.  Not much to it, and you can buy a straight-stitch Singer machine
to do it on for $25 or less (mine was a gift).  The material, from an
outlet, will cost you around $10.  You can sell the machine (after tuning it
up) when you're done for what you paid for it, or keep it (like I did) and
use it to make matching pillows and napkins for the interior and later (like
I also did) use it to sew new seat bottoms into the front seats.  (That
material cost $3)

I will also eventually use this machine to fix up the rear upholstery,
saving myself money in the process.

Some folks think that time is money.  I on the other hand will gladly work
for an hour to save a buck.
