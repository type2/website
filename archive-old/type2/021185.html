&gt; Hello folks - got a MacGyver question for you. I'm interested in using an
&gt; older LCD screen from a dead laptop computer as a TV monitor in my Westy
&gt; (or anywhere else I need a screen).
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know if this possible, and how?
&gt;
&gt; Trying to make do with what I have on hand without searching wrecked Warner
&gt; Bros. Edition minivans or buying $1500 computer monitors, or breaking into
&gt; one of the local university buildings. .

Not without a lot of work.  I was considering the same thing for my Double Cab.
In fact, last week I had someone at work come and ask me the same question.  He
was trying to get around the $$option cost of the in car video system.

There are a number of under $1K laptops that support DVD and have a 13&quot; - 14&quot;
screen.  There are also a number of laptop stands that could be used to mount the
laptop in a bus.  Most of these video screens in the systems that come with the
cars are about 6&quot; screens, the laptops provide much more viewing area, kinda the
big screen of the back seat.  With the laptop, you also get the ability to play
games, attach a GPS, connect to internet from the bus, etc.

If you wanted to build an LCD to Video interface chip (which is what you'd need
for an old laptop screen), it would take a whole lot of work for marginal
results.  You'd need  the schematics for the display you are using, need to know
what protocol was being used for your display and those are just a couple of
starters.

You would be surprised at the number uses of an actual computer properly installed
into a westy would reward you with.

Scott
