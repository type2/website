Subject: Seattle, roof rack FS

I've got a 3/4 length roof rack for sale.  It is not specifically built for
a type 2, as it has big rubber suction cup-type feet and is held to the drip
rails by fabric and metal straps.  However, it is vintage and quite cool
looking.  Wood slats and metal side rails.

Asking $40.00

Can email pics, or come by and see it.
