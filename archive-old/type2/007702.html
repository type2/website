Hey Volks! 
Don't have enough time to post the results of my vw names survey,so I'll have to do it next Friday.It's pretty long.I hope everyone gets to watch the tv show &quot;Dharma and Greg&quot; next wed. I so a commercial for it and saw a bay window type 2 in it.Not sure how much we'll actually see,but I'll be taping it anyways.Remember-Wed.the 18th on ABC &quot;Dharma and Greg&quot;.
