&gt; I searched long &amp; hard through the various Maryland/Baltimore

don't know if they are even on the net....the courts are shall we say
electronically deprived....
   I don't have it on the computer either only in hard copy, it is really
boring reading.... small claims court, charges &quot;non conforming goods&quot;,
default judgement....(Gex offered me my money back the day before court,
probably should have taken it, since getting a judgement and collecting it
are two different things)
