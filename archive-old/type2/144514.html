Subject: Re: [T2] acid garbageman removal/shifter

2 points for Tony.

Hopefully that's urban legend; regardless, it's the gnarliest post of the
day.

Blech!

Bus content: My bus has gotten really hard to shift into 1/2 and sometimes 3/4
also recently.
I have replaced the front bushing, the coupler at the tranny nose and some
bearing (by my mechanic) inside the nosecone recently, so I'm not fearing the
worst.  Will begin with standard shift lever adjustment procedure, maybe
tonight.  Wait, wife's birthday, maybe not.

&gt; A while back a NYC sanitation worker was killed when
&gt; someone threw a container of it away and the truck's compactor
&gt; broke the container, splashing the hydrofluoric acid into the sanit-
&gt; man's face and upper body... ;-(
