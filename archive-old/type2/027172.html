Hey everyone,

  This is a very sad day, cause I'm forced to sell my 2 campers.  The first 
one is a 1977 westy in beautiful brown primer(p.o.).  It runs very strong 
and the electrical system is in good shape.  I drive this van to work 
everyday, which is about 30 miles round trip.  The body has some bondo, 
seeing as how I live in the rust belt.  Its overall appearance is not bad 
once you get used to the primer.  With a cheap paint job, it would easily 
sell for $2000.  This was my plan, but now I really need the money.  The 
second van is a 74 westy that I bought for parts, you know how that is.  
This van has the complete interior which is in good shape, but needs a good 
scrubbing.  It has a spray can Blue paint job, with a matching silver top.  
It has what I believe to be an 1800cc engine with stock dual carbs and it 
runs very well.  I can't tell how it drives, cause it only goes backwards.  
My neighbors think I'm nuts cause when I first got I drove it up and down 
the street backwards a bunch of times(I was a little excited I guess).  I 
would like to get $1800 for the both of them.  These 2 vans could easily be 
made into 1 really great one or 2 almost good ones,the choice is yours.  I 
live in northeast Tn., Johnson City to be exact.  As I mentioned, I'm poor 
so I do not have a digital camera or a scanner.  I'm in the process of 
getting my friends camera to get some pics.  Believe me for the price you 
can't beat these vans.  You can p-mail me with questions, or call at (423) 
477-0506 any time before 9:30 pm, as I get up really early for work. My 
e-mail address is JCSANT_at_HOTMAIL.COM



Thank you
Justin
