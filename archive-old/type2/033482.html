Subject: Re: Husbands, Busses and Obsession

Hope this isn't suppose to be just a friday thing (I'm a little late on
reading the posts.)

Gosh, I love my bus &amp; bug!

Like Nikki wrote:
I was downtown last night and saw about five buses in a two-block
radius. I just want to hug every one of them I see. I'm not sure why.

I feel the same way, but have no clue why either. : )  I use to hug my bus
all the time last summer!  Now scooby 'the mystery machine' is stored for
the winter. : ( Just don't know how it's going to be when I get a
boyfriend!  I love my bus!

&gt;Is there a point where a wife/s.o. should start to worry
&gt;about their husbands/boyfriends love of VW busses becoming an obsession?

Worry- no life's too short to worry!

1) How much time is too much time to spend
working on a vehicle that has already had everything rebuilt, and runs well?

There's never too much time spent on a bus. : )

2) Is it manditory to &quot;tweak&quot; things on a regular basis?

Yes! Have to make sure it's running in perfect condition.

3) How many
accessorys does a Delux ' 78 Westphalia camper need, anyway?

Hmmm, the more the better!

And the Big One:
Is my husband the only one who looks at his westy and gets &quot;excited&quot;

Oh no! Whenever I see my bus, (or another bus for that matter) I get a huge
grin on my face.  Then I feel just wonderful!  I don't exactly know why. :
)  Guess I'm just a VW addict.

Happy bussing!
