&gt; Does anyone have a picture of one of these bolt on sump heaters? I'm new to
&gt; busses and am having trouble picturing what one looks like. Do you leave it
&gt; on the sump all the time? As in, drive with it installed?

It's just a replacement for the sump plate with a resistance coil built
into it.
