Subject: engine from a 411 in a 72 Westy???

I'm looking into options for my engine in my 72 Westy.  When I bought
the bus the engine had (and still has) a dropped valve, I have all the
parts, carbs, exhaust, and other things.

        I also have been talking to a guy in New Hampshire about a engine from
a 1971 type 4 VW (411). What would it take to put this engine in my 72
Westy, can I use the same ehaust and carbs, since this is a more
powerful engine??

        And should I go the route of getting a used engine and possible
rebuilding mine later or go for rebuilding mine now (with a high cost as
my heads are only good for paper weights). I only have about $500 - $600
dollars to spend at the moment.

        Also I need to rebuild the dual carbs and was wondering from the all
experienced list member, who has the best quality and economical carbs
rebuild kits?

Here is the ad from which I want the engine,

&gt; 1970 VW Westfalia camper in great condition, strong 1600cc
&gt; motor, almost no rust, interior in good condition, needs
&gt; very little work, $1250.

&gt; 1972 VW Westfalia camper in good condition, excellent
&gt; interior, some rust, no motor $600.

&gt; 1971 80hp Type 4 engine...This is one powerful puppy!
&gt; Your 411,412, or Type 2 bus/westy is begging for this motor!
&gt; Would fit nicely in either of the above mentioned vehicles,
&gt; only $500!

&gt; 1973 VW Bus in a sorry state of existence, but has many 
&gt; wonderful attributes. A bundle of excellent parts...glass,
&gt; seals, rims, tires, seats, hardware, etc. If this bus could
&gt; talk, the tales it would tell! Unfortunately it's rusted-
&gt; through floor has seen better days. An insulting price of
&gt; $250.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the deal everyone...I need cash so everything MUST
&gt; go. My little collection of heaven is valued at roughly
&gt; $3000 but the first individual with $2000 and a loving home 
&gt; for my little German children takes everything! Let's talk
&gt; turkey!! s_pageau_at_oz.plymouth_dot_edu or (603)444-6011 after 
&gt; 6P.M. EST Thanks 

His name is Steve and is located in New Hampshire.
Remember though the engine is mine!!
