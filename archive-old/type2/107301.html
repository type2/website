Subject: Re: [T2] Re Dye-ing headrests - had me worried there ;-)

&gt;Since ya gotta buy the whole kit-n-kabobble to make it work right -
&gt;any reason why you just don't buy the appropriate color covers you desire?
&gt;IIRC they are not exactly cheap, but how many times to you want to fiddle
&gt;around?  OTOH - do the later headrests have replaceable covers?  I'm only
&gt;familiar with the earlier ones - if the latter, please don't waste the
&gt;bandwidth chastizing me, m'kay?


No they do not have replaceable covers but I saw some very nice hand 
stitched covers done by a local upholstery guy for a friend on her '78.

So if you were talented enough, they can be covered very nicely with 
whatever upholstery you like.
