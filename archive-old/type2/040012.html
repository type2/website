Subject: Re: 5-day Oil Change

Could be the wrong filter, could be the wrong oil (right, Steve?), could
be a short. I'm becoming an Instant Expert[tm] on all three!
baaaaa-haaaaaa-haaaaaaa &lt;bangs head against nearest wall&gt;

Would that be the *same* mechanic who changed the oil? If so, I'd
suggest you get under there and change the oil and filter yourself
post-haste. I'm still too intimidated to tackle that strainer thang.
Gotta get a tiny torque wrench (that's how I think of it).

I just had a parts counter guy tell me today, &quot;The Fram oil filter is
just fine for VWs.&quot; Uh-huh, that's not what I heard....

&gt; My oil light comes on pretty often now.  I checked the oil level and there's
&gt; plenty in it.  I talked to a mechanic and he says it's probably just a short
&gt; in the wiring, but it seems to happen only when I rev the engine.  I just
&gt; bought my '75 adventure van about a month ago, so I don't know what filter
&gt; is on it.  Could the oil light blinking be a result of the wrong filter?
