The glass that covers my speedometer and idot lights is very loose, so I
removed my instrument panel to try to find the cause. Looks as though there
may have been rubber seals in here at one time and they have rotted out.  Can
anyone confirm this or explain the cause and correction.  If seals need
replaced where can I get them?
