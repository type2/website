Subject: Re-movement in  bearing vs its housing

The throwout bearing is really a full sealed bearing &quot;pressed&quot; inside a
surrounding plate with the clips and center rolled edge. The bearings
are fine (tight, not noisy) but in some there is a bit of movement if
you push the edges of the bearing relative to the housing- this seems to
be common- can you check some of yours?  The &quot;new&quot; bearing I have (looks
like the beetle style) moves a fair amount- but then consider how much
movement the clips on the sides allow- perhaps the bearing just centers
itself?

 Not sure what you mean by your last sentence. But if the bearing has
any side movement, consider it a
 paperweight :)
