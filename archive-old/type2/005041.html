Folks,

I know this was a topic a week, or so ago, but I have a question and =
please forgive me if it was already covered.

The slider on my '72 basic bus does not &quot;pop&quot; open when I turn the =
handle unless I give it a bit of assistance.  I just need to give a =
gentle pull on the hinge/arm that is exposed on the exterior rear of the =
door as I turn the handle and it pops right open.  So, what am I =
missing?  Is there supposed to be a spring?  A roller worn out?  Replace =
the entire mechanism?  I did notice where one of the catalogues I get is =
showing a replacement roller for the mechanism, but don't want to get it =
unless it will solve the problem.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Phil
