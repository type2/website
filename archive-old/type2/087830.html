Subject: Re: [T2] re-Conti CR21 tires

Well, I have two wrong tires on the front, Cooper non C rated tires that
were new on the van when I got it. I haven't got the heart to scrap em.
However, it is as good on the highway as they ever are, which is to say, it
blows around, especially with a high top!! Tom

&gt; &gt; I run two of these Conti Contact 185R14-Reinforced on my bus. The tire
shop
&gt; &gt; where I got them said they have road hazard warranty, but C and D rated
&gt; &gt; tires don't. Sounds like a factor worth considering. They are nice
tires.
&gt;
&gt; How does it handle on the highway with the crosswinds?
