&gt; hey everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; i heard there is a VW shop in eastern Maryland near the bay bridge. I think 
&gt; its a restoration shop with some busses for sale. anyone know of this or 
&gt; where its located?

yes it is near Wye Mills just off Rt 50 (can see it from 50 if I recall)
can't think of the name but it is fairly high priced but seems to be
decent quality and he had the parts I needed when I needed em.
