Subject: Tranny Weep

While checking the oil in my manual transmission I noticed that it was
leaking slightly on both sides behind the CV joints. Not much, not enough to
drip, just enough to put a sheen of oil on the case all the way to the
bottom. I assume there is a seal behind the CV mount. Is this a seal I can
replace myself, or is it a job for a professional? I'm quite handy but I
don't relish the thought of tearing into a transmission. Not without a spare
sitting close, anyway.

Thanks,
Dave
