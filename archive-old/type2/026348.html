	I can't (and won't, obviously) disagree with the principle behind
this, and I almost touched upon it briefly in my last post.  Yes, you are
correct about the (lack of a) free lunch.  The only place I disagree is in
its practice.  An alternator will only supply so much current, regardless of
electrical load placed on the system.  When the internal regulator senses a
drop in voltage, it rectifies(pun intended) the situation by supplying
current to the battery in order to charge it.  Obviously, if you place too
much load on the downside, the upside won't be able to compensate, which
will = dead battery.  One manufacturer out there makes a 75 amp alternator,
which I plan to run on my A/C encumbered bay.  I also have a spiral-cell
technology battery with a substantial reserve capacity.  Air conditioning
already taxes the stock alternator with the current supplied to the internal
and external fans, plus the coil in the compressor's clutch.  The added
voltage drop created by the aforementioned pump should be negligible in
relationship to the total drop.

how

&gt; them as &quot;starting at $16.98&quot;) and using that to run the water system?

&gt; This unfortunately defeats the purpose of the extra cooling by adding
extra
&gt; load to the engine, which =  added BTU.  An electric pump is the only way
I
&gt; can think of to bypass this problem.  If you were to use a full-sized
&gt; mechanical pump, Moroso makes an electrically driven one for drag-racing
&gt; V-8's.

To quote R.A Heinlein, TANSTAAFL. There ain't no such thing as a free
lunch. 

Running an electric pump is going to take a bit more hp than a
mechanical pump.  Why? Those electrons have to come from somewhere.
