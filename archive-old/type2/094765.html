Subject: Re: [T2] engine swap

I agree with Mike for the most part. It will be a lot of work. (Funny thing 
is the other way around is doable; ie. a 1600 into a later bus....)

The better option is trying to sell your 1700 and use the money to build a 
bug motor. The pancake engine is more expensive to work on, so you might 
find a buyer that wants a complete unit for about the same as you will spend 
to build a nice bug motor. I personally feel that the 1700 is not a very 
good motor anyway. The failure rate is pretty high from what I have seen. 
The type 4 2 liter is a completly different situation, with a much greater 
longevity.

Where I differ from Mikes opinion, is that a bug motor the size of a 1776 
built well can do wonders for a bus regardless of the year. Its no screamer 
(assuming you keep compression at 7.5 or so) but will give you that modern 
car pick up even with the older tranny. Its not too much for  it at all.
