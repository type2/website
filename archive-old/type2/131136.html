Subject: '71 rear brake woes

Thanks,
No, handbrake isn't on.
Re penitrating oil, I did apply Liquid Wrench at the lug studs to ease 
possible rust binding of drums to hubs. Also carefully applied to adjuster 
threads. No go yet, but fortunately time is on my side, this is not my only 
car.
Will continue to oil and bang.
Other suggestions????
Thanks
-----------------------------------
I wanted to have a look at my rear brakes, removed the 11mm bolts and
pounded on drums, drums would not move. Tried to back off adjusting stars,
but they are basically frozen.
----- How can I get the drums off??
----- Is the amount of lining I'm seeing thru the inspection holes fairly
representitve of the entire lining surface??
No real problems w brakes, pedal height is good, no apparent cylinder
leakage, and ~3/16&quot; of lining thru the inspection hole, but I've never had a
look in there (tho have had the rear bearings greased) and have put
120k(mostly road miles) on them since purchace from PO.
Any suggestions appreciated.
Thanks
