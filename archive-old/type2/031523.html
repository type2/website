Your mail to the type2 list has been intercepted and is being
returned to you because it appears to the list server to
contain an excessive amount of quoted material.

Brief quoting is fine, but please quote only for context.
Do not quote other messages in their entirety, or quote
message headers or signature files.

If you feel that you have edited your message adequately but
it was still returned to you, you can bypass this filter by
including this string of characters:

anywhere in your message at the beginning of a line.

&gt; &gt;  I would like to replace the plexi with something besides a pop-top. 
&gt; &gt; I've seen sliding rag tops on some buses and was wondering if I might

&gt; &gt; something like this?

I have seen a bus with a beetle body from the belt rail up welded over the
opening,  sort of like the old Railroad vista dome cars

&gt; I think you need a flying bridge, ala Further:

&gt; 
&gt; *I* think that would be way cooler than plexiglass, and, if you did it 
&gt; right
&gt; and made a platform whose weight rested on the gutters instead of the 
&gt; roof,
&gt; you could even make a locking trap-door and have some semblance of rain
&gt; protection.
