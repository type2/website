A goes to E
D goes to C

Fuel flows in this direction: Tank, Filter, Pump, A, E, Injector rails, D,
C, regulator, F, back to Tank

The regulator should also have a vacuum line on the small nipple. It uses
vacuum to control fuel pressure. The pump just runs full blast all the time,
and the regulator allows enough fuel to return to the tank to maintain 35
PSI in the fuel injector rails.
