Subject: Air Vent Covers?

Does anybody know of such a thing as some kind of cover that goes over the
outside air vents for the rear. Living here in Seattle, it's starting to get
wet outside. I get a little nervous knowing that the rain is probably pouring
into the engine compartment. Or is this a new idea that could make me rich?
Even washing the van would make these handy...If they do exist...Where can I
find a pair?
