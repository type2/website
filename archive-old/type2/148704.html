Subject: Fuel lines

Okay so while I was poking around the engine I gave it good inspection
for the first time since I bought the van a few weeks ago.  The fuel
lines are a mis-match of various repairs over time and will be replaced,
but I am not sure of a few things.

Coming out of the bottom of the tank is about 1 foot of line then a
clear filter the line rounds up to a metal &quot;something&quot; (about a 1 1/2
inches diameter and 3 or so inches long) inline mounted near the
transmission.  It comes out of that and on to the engine compartment.

What is the second metal inline device? Is it an original fuel filter?
