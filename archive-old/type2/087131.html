Subject: wups...brake servo help..


Venerable list,

I am in the midst of finally replacing practically all brake parts on my 
78.

The rear brakes, that have been &quot;sticky&quot; were practically brand new...the 
drivers side one had what appeared to be cosmoline on the linings and some 
still one the shoe itself.  I have new ones and new hoses and 
cylinders...no problem.

The rear drums appear to be almost new inside also...no lip on the brake 
surface edge at all...cool...sand blast and por15 the outside.


But, the springs are put through from the trans side!!  ok, so spread the 
shoes and get the bottom and the top springs off.  no problem.

Is this normal?? ..or a p.o. type of thing.

In the midst of replacing the master cylinder, I decide to take the 
booster off, sand blast it and then por15 it.  

Got it off ok, but the back side has some brake fluid in it...uh oh....

Can I wash it out with alchohol and let it dry?

Brake boosters are a new thing for me so I need some advice on this.

Brakes were working just &quot;ok&quot;.  Great stopping power, but they seemed 
kinda sticky.  
I haven't got to the front ones yet, but have brand new pads and calipers 
for that.


Remember this one had been sitting for 8 years.

Note to vendors:  Please include bleeder caps with calipers and 
                  cylinders!!!  I would have bought them if I thought
                  they didn't come with them!

Cheers ,dave
