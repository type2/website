Subject: steering arm removal - tranny compatibility

re there any household tricks to removing
the steering arm from the steering box splines?

i've tried every method of prying, punding, tapping, 
wedging i can think of...
there isn't enough penetrant in the world i think, 
not that it's especiallyrusty.

anymore pounding, and i think it'll bend, or i'll mess
up the steering box.

also, how much play, if any should there be in
the pilot shaft? side to side, not in and out.

fustrated after a day of not being able 
to get the steering arm off. either bus.
other than that, i'm ready to unbolt the front
beams from the frames and swap them..

there also seems to be a cylinder around the pilot
shaft in teh '71's tranny. the pressure plate
on that engine is one with many small spring loaded
points aiming towards the center [kennedy?], the '68 pressure
plate [new] is teh three spring points, with a doughnut
in the center.  is there going to be any problem with
clearances, and if there is a possiblity, how can i measure
to be sure?
