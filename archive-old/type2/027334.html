&gt;Searched the Library and archives, but could not find the answer for this 
&gt;one. the turn signals and emergency flashers on my 70 Westy all work fine, 
&gt;but the Turn signal indicator lights on my dash both *blink* when I use my 
&gt;turn signals.

I have this same problem, except my emergency flashers don't work, they just 
come on and stop. I'm suspecting the turn siganl relay but that's just an 
uneducated guess! If you figure it out, let me know. (I have a '71)

&gt;By the way, this being my first extended time in the bus, does it always 
&gt;feel a little weird at first to be ahead of the front tires?

I did alot of bus driving in the Army and in a 44 pack Bluebird the front 
wheels are about five feet behind you! Eventually you get used to it.

Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
