&gt;I'm going to ask what may be a very stupid question, but how does one
&gt;set the timing statically?  Are you talking about rotating the
&gt;distributor while listening for the best setting?
&gt;
There are no stupid questions!  Static timing refers to setting the ignition
timing with the engine stopped.  Usually you would attach a simple test
light in parallel with the points.  In other words, attach the wire from the
test light to terminal 1 on the coil, (the terminal that the small wire from
the distributor hooks to), and ground the tip of the test light.  Then
switch on the ignition, (don't start the engine).  The test light will then
light when the points are open and go out when they are closed.  Then rotate
the crankshaft clockwise.  The light should light up at whatever point you
want to set the timing.  Usually 7 1/2 degrees with a 009 distributor, or
most single advance vacuum distributors.  You will have to figure out what
the different marks on the pulley indicate.  The most common pulley has a
small knotch for top dead center (0 degrees) and two knotches close together
about 1/2 or 3/4 of an inch to the right.  These notches (notice the
spelling change, I get so tired of spelling things the same way all the
time) indicate either 5 and 7 1/2 degrees or 7 /12 and 10 degrees (I never
can remember).  Some later pulleys have a wider, smooth notch in the rear
lip of the pulley (rear means rear, toward the back of the car) to indicate
top dead center and notches on the front of the pulley for the advance (or
retard) settings.  If there is a notch to the left of the smooth mark,
that's 5 degrees retarded for the double diaphragm distributor, (with the
engine running at idle and all the vacuum lines hooked up).  Have I confused
you enough yet?  Make sure you set the timing on number one cylinder, some
distributors retard number three a little.
goforit!
