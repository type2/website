Joe, The only reason I can see for doing this is to preserve a balanced
set.  If you are having your crank and flywheel ballanced, then the
pressure plate (or clutch cover plate) ought to go along for the ride.
Thereafter, that plate and flywheel, and indeed the bolts holding the
pressure plate to the flywheel, ought to be indexed the way they were
ballanced.  Since yours is a replacement plate, I can think of no reason
to index it.

&gt; If this is a significant concern, would it be a better idea to just
&gt; put on a new clutch on my new longblock (and flywheel) and minimize
&gt; the likelyhood for future clutch problems?

Yes, but not for the reason you mentioned :-)  I tend toward installing a
new clutch disk and looking *very* hard at the pressure plate when I am
installing a longblock, just because I hate to go in there more often than
I have to and and I figure even the $100+ for a new pressure plate for a
T4 is cheap compared to an engine pull.  BTW, it would still be a good
idea to take your flyhweel and pressure plate down to a machine shop and
have them balanced before you install your new rebuild.
