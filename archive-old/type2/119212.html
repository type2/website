&gt;&gt; Hi Andy,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You might want to shop around for a place that can do the balancing
&gt;&gt; **on the vehicle**. Apparently this is a new thing
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to the list about going around in circles a bit on this thread...

Ugh. Brutal pun.

&gt;
&gt; Balancing on the vehicle is not new, it is totally old skule. The 
&gt; machine
&gt; that does it is made by &quot;Bear&quot;, you know the chassis machine company 
&gt; that
&gt; has the cool old logo of, yes, a bear.
