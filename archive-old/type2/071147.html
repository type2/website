I'm going to purchase an electric fuel pump since my mechanical one has since
decided to stop working (it was fun using gravity to get home, not really).
Do I need an engine specific one, (I have a 72 westy with a 1700 pancake with
twin webers) or can I just go down to NAPA and pick up a &quot;electric fuel pump
for carburetor engines&quot;.  Recommendations?

Thanks,
Tripps
