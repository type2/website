Hey Bob!

the reverse threads is because propane is considered a fuel, like Acetylene.  
That's why - so you don't get them mixed up with the &quot;air&quot; or &quot;oxygen&quot; 
regulators and stuff!

I even had a coleman lantern that hooked to the top of the little bottles and 
hung up (tho I always hung it on a piece of wire, just in case!)... a lot 
better than worrying about killing my battery, and it kept the bus warm if 
needed...

BTW, one other thing I did was to use the stove on low low low as an 
emergency heater... not recommended, but in a pinch it was better than 
freezing!  Left the poptop unzipped a few inches for ventillation.  I was 
trying to figure how to make a &quot;fueling station&quot; using a 5 gallon propane 
tank to fuel the buses little propane tank... I know it's safe, but I'm not 
about to tear it out to get it OK'd and then put it back in!  Or maybe just a 
way to hook a 5 gal. tank inline... (Any ideas??)

Hugs,
Susanne

yourself.  Abuse no one and nothing, for abuse turns the wise ones into fools
