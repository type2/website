The fan/generator belt broke, but before it went, it thrashed around and
made a lot of noise, so my wife pulled over and the '68 Westy was not
driven hot.  After I arrived on the scene and began to replace the belt
I noted - Horror - I could move the pulley (and the crankshaft?)  from
side to side.  No up and down movement, but a slight side to side.
The motor is a '68 1600 SP with a recent stock rebuild.  I had the
fl-vw-aps set the end play, they also put new bearings on the crank, and
this motor has been running strong and smooth for about 1200 miles.
I'm thinking that side to side play can't be a good thing, but hoping
maybe a re torque of the case nuts might help.  Any thoughts?
To the women bus owners, this Westy actually belongs to my wife.  It was
a Christmas present from me and part of the present was that I'd take
care of all the maintenance for her.  Sometimes she lets me drive it.
To the age curious, I am 39.
