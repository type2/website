Subject: Intro

Hi,
    I'm new to the list, and thought I might introduce myself.  My name
is Dennis Rumba, and I live in Thorndike, Maine.  I have had several VW's
including Crumbly, a early 68 (Aug 67) bay window parts van, Thumper a
semi-rusty 69 with a 78 camper interior, and China Cat, a beautiful 66
Beetleand many H2O VWs.  My current VW's include 1 1985 Golf GTI , 1983
Rabbit, and my pride and joy, Cleo, a 1976 bus, which I converted to a 1600
dual port upright engine with Jacobson Ignition, and a complete and perfect
70 Dormobile camper interior with electric fridge, gas stove, sink, and bed.
Looking forward to meeting you all and trying to help keep all our VW's on
the road!
    -Dennis Rumba
