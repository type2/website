Subject: Hot wheels drag bus

Hi everyone I have rejoined the list after months of being absent, since
before the list split.

I am currently looking for the elusive hot wheels drag bus, my bigest
obsticle is price of course. I was wondering if any very nice person out
there had any opended or packaged buses for sale at the great price of
$15.00 or so?  I am going to have them customized for premiums for the
buisness (see below link) I also have and offer of a $20.00 credit twards
the purchase (at cost of customization no markup) for list members, if your
interested and want to use an extra you have laying around =).  My sole
purpose of doing this is to produce some really cool premiums to go out with
my products, I will be selling no more than 1/2 the final number produced to
help with the cost and all others will only be obtainible by meating a
minimum purchase from PLF.  pre orders at cost will only help me make more
which my goal is to make as many as possibe

want to see it go to www.plfvw_dot_com/misc/plfdragbus1.gif

mail me with any info or questions

thankyou
