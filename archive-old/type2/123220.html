&gt; we're all about ready for a run to baja in the 75 westy. i've been getting

&gt; worry - that 12 mpg in town and 15-16 in the highway is what is to be
&gt; expected.

A good sanity check is to pull the plugs to see if you're running rich.  
If not, then you're probably ok.

Off the top of my head, I'd say 15-16 highway is &quot;ok&quot; and 12 in town is a 
little low.  But the first thing people are going to want to know is:

    are you fuel injected or are you running carbs?  If carbs, which?
