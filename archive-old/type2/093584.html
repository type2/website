Subject: VWofA hassle;  new aftermarket crankshaft pulley


While browsing VW magazines at the local market I found the following:

The current issue of VW Trends has an interesting editorial about the VWofA hassle.  Written by the same guy that did their interview with VWofA that was published a month or two back.

Same VW Trends has a brief article about a new aftermarket crankshaft pulley for Type 1 engines.  It's intended to speed up the cooling fan.  Does so by substantially increasing the size of the crank pulley as opposed to decreasing the size of the generator/alternator pulley.  Looks pretty good in the photos, and has degree markings &quot;for accurate timing setting&quot;.
