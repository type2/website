&lt;&lt; The wheel is mounted to the body on my bus.  I bought the mount and
 cover from Rocky Mountain Motor Works for $35.  It was easy to install. 
 There have been threads on better ways to mount the tire.  It works fine
 for me, but I have not had a flat yet.  I think there is an insert that can
be
 put in the hole so you don't tear your bus' nose off when you remove the
 tire from the mount.  Think Ron Salmon said something about that?
 
 Good Luck

As for front-mounted tire carriers - if you already have one, STOP anyone who
even remotely LOOKS like they're going to use the spare tire as a stepladder
to load the front luggage compartment!!  I didn't, and now my tire carrier is
ripped out of the body...  Can anyone tell me how to get to those bolts to
_remove_ the tire carrier?  I don't see any way to reach them from under the
bus, they seem to have lock nuts of some kind, and i would really like to
repair the damage before it starts to RUST!

TIA,
