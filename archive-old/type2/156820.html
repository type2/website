I want a bus made out of the same stuff as those Little Tykes cars are
made of.  That stuff is indestructable.  I could drive by Braille.  :)

At BBBX, there were a few guys with Bays that they had painted with pickup
bed liner material.  Looked pretty darned good and it was extremely
scratch resistant.  Nice bright colors, too.  You have to get into the
texture, though.
