Subject: spare parts / tools for ME-CA trip

 Hi all,
        I've been lurking for a short time and have to admit that this is
one of the best lists around.  I had a couple of questions, so its time for
me to break my silence.  :)   I'm planning a trip in a from Maine to
California (and back) via the hotter regions (ie. I-40 instead of I-80).  I
am planning on getting a '71 Westy for the trip, but have never had a bus,
though I have gained alot of experience from working on my other vehicles
over the years, so I feel able to handle most smaller problems, but I hear
alot about cross-country travellers (and daily drivers alike!) carrying
around lots of extra parts in case something dies.  Could some kind soul
please post a list of parts I should bring with me so the bus has a better
chance of getting home after this fiasco?   
        Also, I would like to get some real tools before the trip.  As
things have been for years, I have been using all sorts of disorganized
sockets and combo wrenches, and don't have a complete set, so I will be
getting a full metric set of both and a big driver for the sockets.  Aside
from that and the BFS ('screwdriver of unusually large size' -- saw that in
a post recently :), what other tools would you recommend to fix common
problems?  
        Thanks in advance for any help you can offer,                  ^^
