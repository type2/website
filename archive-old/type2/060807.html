Subject: Re: Parts Failure Survey -LOAFS

&gt; 
&gt; Volks... it's Friday and I'm finally able to ask a survey type
&gt; question.  Yea!!
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to identify the common failure items of VW vans.  Although I
&gt; own a '76 Westy, I am interested in all of the vans of the same body
&gt; style.  I won't call 'em breadloafs 'cause it tends to confuse the
&gt; newbies, of which I was one untill just recently.
&gt; 
&gt; Example of the items that I have in mind are:
&gt; 
&gt;         1.  Front axle beam -The rust on mind killed Ralphy my 76 Westy.
&gt;         2.  Mirrors support bracket - Mine fell off at 65 mph
&gt;         3.  The sliding door latch.
&gt;         4.  Dirsctional signal switch.  The internal levers broke off &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Obviously, ignition parts, clutch and accelerator cables are very useful
&gt; as would valve cover gaskets and seals for the push rod tubes.  But what
&gt; other parts have frequent failure on the VW bus? Does anybody have any
&gt; suggestions?
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Thanks for reading.

&gt; and a lot of dreams
Dave:
1. Nomenclature- loafs (or is it loaves) works for me, it creates a nice
mental picture, and it's distinctly non-German. ( Don't get me wrong,
some of my best friends are Germans[it's Friday] -not to mention my four
grandparents), but I think this obsession with preciseness and numbers
and complexity only illustrates my theory that &quot;Germans are legends in
their own minds&quot;. Germans call loafs T2a's 68-71 and T2b's 72-79,
although they are not sure to split between 71-72 or 72-73 (see! loafs
works for all)
2. Turn signal switch: I'm a little hazy about 76's, but I drove a 78 
about 80k miles and never had trouble with that. It did burn up 4 motors
before I figured out what was wrong. [Temp sensor II (?), the one in the 
AFM was defective, a good clue should have been excessive richness at
temps below 0F., it took me a long time to make the leap to realize that
the inverse (or is it converse) was happening at high ambients (too
lean) This is something all fi bus owners should pay attention to. 
Earlier loaf turn signal switches 68-72 always worked loose from their
moorings and eventually broke wires at the solder joint (not too hard to
fix if you know how to solder).
3. Clutch cables break suddenly and it's a good idea to check out the
recent post on fixing the lever, too. Accelerator cables will eventually
fray from wear, but it takes about 100k miles, so if you're there, just
fix it now and mark your calender to check it in 2010.
4. FI parts eventually fail. I went thru several fuel filters, a few 
injectors, one bellows-type hose that hooks the throttle body to the
AFM, the aforementioned AFM,and I changed the small fuel hoses that make
up the high pressure fuel ring. (Incidently, VW changed to steel lines
from the left side to the cold start injector and from the cold start
injector to the right side in about 77 or 78 so if anyone has an earlier
car that hasn't already incinerated itself this would be a really good
upgrade. I never had a fuel pump fail, but if you're traveling any
distance from civilization, I'd sure take along a known good spare. I've 
had used ones check out okay and after 2 years of rattling around in my
van not work when offered to a friend, so probably the best spare is a
new one in a box with proper plugs on the nipples, but I never had $180
extra for that!
5. While on the subject of fires, EVERY CAR NEEDS A FIRE EXTINGUISHER!
Because of my care in replacing hoses my cars never burned, by my wife
and I have each used our extinguisher to put out someone else's fires!
(I have to admit I was surprised at her level-headedness in this
incident!)
6. I changed the clutch disc and t-o bearing at 130k miles. It wasn't
slipping, but the shock springs in the disc were worn out. I think we're
really not very hard on clutches, but this is Iowa, not San Francisco,
so that helps.
7. Front axle beams: EVERYTHING got rusty on my 78 about the same time, 
1990, I guess, so the rusty axle beam wasn't the biggest problem.
However there are many loafs in western junkyards that have axle beams
that look like NEW. I got a perfect one for my 69 double cab for $120
freight included from somewhere in Aridzona .
8. CV joints: I replaced them all at about 90k miles because I had
access to a lift and got a good price on 4 kits. I've since then learned
better (or just have less spare time) and now just inspect the boots
when I change the oil. I'm of the opinion that these things last about
forever if the boots are intact and they are serviced around every
40-50k miles.
9. Exhaust, brake pads, shocks. Replace as needed. Climate is harder on
exhaust than use. Brakes and shocks are easy to determine where you're
at.
10. Pushrod tube seals did eventually fail. New viton seals (are they
white or green?) are much better than original equipment.

That's about all that failed on my 78, which except for the engine
getting roasted by the lean conditions, was really quite a low 
maintenance vehicle. But as many listees know, they are really quite
wonderful  vehicles! Quirky but they build a lot of loyalty in their
owners! I can't say the same about vanagons.
