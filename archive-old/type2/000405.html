	The idle cutoff solenoid was one of the first things I checked, actually, as I'd had trouble with an iffy connection to that little source of joy in the past. I also checked for vacumn leaks everywhere I could think of. It's a single port so there's no manifold boots. The manifold's on tight. The little whatsit on the condenser wire in the distributor base is snug (although if it weren't I magine my advance would be wiggy). The throat plug is peened in. No hoses missing or deteriorated. It's a stumper even if the problem does seem to be solved.
	The oil bath air cleaner and its mount were removed. I have a Bugpack paper filter on there. It does make it easier to crawl around in there and it seems to catch the chicken feathers just fine. The weather around here doesn't seem to get cold enough for the lack of a preheater to be a serious problem.

	Line wraps? Are these posts coming in as big long lines of text? I'll fiddle with this fine Microsoft product of an email client...

Sounds like the idle cut off solenoid to me!

&gt; I'd suspect vacuum leaks. Resetting the idle air bypass and mixture
&gt; might have compensated for anover lean condition. Maybe the manifold
&gt; sleeves? Also you mentioned air filter. Huh? Don't you have an oil bath
&gt; air cleaner? What do you do for preheating carb air when it's cold?
&gt; I know winter in Seattle is like a blustery October day here in Iowa,
&gt; but 40-45F is cold enough to need carb preheat, and would ruin your
&gt; idle.
&gt; Also why don't you teach your e-mail program to do line wraps. I'm no
&gt; computer whiz, but Netscape mail figured that one out for me. It would
&gt; make your post much easier to read.
&gt; Then again, maybe you got chicken feathers in the idle air bypass,
&gt; through that non-stock air filter.
