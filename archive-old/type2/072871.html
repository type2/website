Subject: bus gens and pulleys

while there have been a few statements made that you CAN'T run a
non-castiron pulley on the longer, superduper hiamp bus generator
(gr17xyz123 testingtesting),  i have been running the stamped steel ones
for some time.
note that i did not say that I  had no problems running the stamped ones,
or even that I LIKED running the stamped ones...
there are several types, most gold-colored, most sh*tty as hell; i run a
brazilian one that seems to be lasting longer than a year. i have had mex
and brazilian ones waller out their center holes and either a) the halves
start spinning independently of each other or b) the thing wobbles on the
gen shaft, eventually ruining it.

BUT i have had a cast pulley from germany waller out the hub, too. once.
after 20K.

if you can find a good cast one with little hub wear (CHECK IT), use it.
otherwise, make do w/ what is out there, as always picking out the
best-quality ones you can...
