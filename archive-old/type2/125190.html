Subject: Bob the parts guy

A while back I was looking for heat exchangers and muffler for my bus and a
gentleman by the name of Bob gave me pricing.
I have misplaced my way of getting ahold of him.
Can anyone or Bob himself help me by dropping me an email.
He also heals in West Coast Metric Parts.
Peace,
