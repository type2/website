&gt; Is there anything special about the type 4 flywheel bolts or are they
&gt; just M12x1.5x22mm bolts with the hex flange style head?

They are a higher than normal grade as well.  I believe they are grade 8.8
though they may be 10.9.  I don't have one handy to look.  They are still
available from the dealer and I would check there.

                             OOK!
