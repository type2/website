Hello Guys   This could be a oiling problem. Not getting oil thur the push 
rods or the rockers. take them off an blow thur the tubes and rockers making 
sure they are clear. Have seen new guides stick also. Might need to run at 
high idle for a couple of hours making sure they are getting oil/.  Later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
