Hey there Volks,

You can buy a lock from several online vendors (~ $80 w/ a key), get
one from a junkyard (usually w/o a key), or from a swapmeet. 

My 78 donor had one (now it's on the 79) and the doors/ignition key
didn't unlock it. I assumed it was a dealer installed option, and
that a PO had lost the engine hatch key. I had a key cut from the
code, for $20 at the local locksmith and added it to my key ring.

It is nice to be able to lock the engine up when you park somewhere
'unsafe', or just as a deterant to stop the local kids from putting
sand and rocks in your fan :(

HTH,
