Subject: vanagon sliding door handles

The door handle on my '82 sliding door has been sagging for a while, so I
decided to open up the door panel and check out why. I assumed I would just
have to tighten up a screw or two or bend a spring...

The handle is a cast piece of cheap pot metal, and the main barrel is cracked
most of the way through!  Since I found this out, I have noticed sagging
sliding door handles on lots of vanagons, along with one the other day which
had completely broken off!

The dealer wants ~$80 for a new one.  What I want to know is, have these things
gotten better over the years, or will the new one just break off, too?  The
junkyard wants to sell me the whole door, and won't part with just the handle.
Is there a new &amp; improved version out there for sale somewhere?
