Bob, I used the VDO rubber underdash mounting bracket as I also didn't want
to drill holes in the dash. Yes, the spokes of the steering wheel exactly
blocked reading them easily. The cure= when I had my front wheels aligned,I
had the steering wheel offset a little so I can view the gauges directly.
Took about a week to get used to it but it has worked great for the last 15k
miles. I don't even notice it now and can read my gauges at a glance. TBear
