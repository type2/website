Subject: Re: [T2] bridgestone dueller A/T tires

Thanks Bob,

This exactly why I wrote &quot;Load range C does not mean squat. What is the max load weight marked on the side?&quot;

If you guys want to bet your life on Load range C, go right ahead!

[I wish I had a picture of a set of 4 LT tires that were Load range D. Those may-pops had a max weight rating
of 1311 lbs.!!!! They were at the Bakersfield show in the spring]

What is the max load weight marked on the side?

I just looked at a 78 Westy that had brand new Kirkland load range C tires on it and the max weight rating was
LESS than Michelin passenger car tires!  Michelin 185R14 are 1450 lbs. Michelin 185R14 reinforced are 1540
lbs. which is the minimum weight rating for a Westy. The Kirkland's were 1435 lbs.!

And Bob replied:

 and from the other side of the barn my 205/70R14 Michelin bus tires have a
load range of C but are rated at 1993lbs (or thereabouts) and have 99S
rating....far more than enough and handle very well, (at about $500 for 4
they better, but)
