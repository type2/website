&gt; Thanks for your replies!  Unfortunately, it looks as though I should have
&gt; been clearer: it is only connected below the air intake distributor (appears
&gt; to be connected to the firewall - I can only feel around; can't see!) The
&gt; other end is the one I can see - flopping about - and it is this end that
&gt; has three prongs within a dust boot.

??????? the connector for the cold start valve or the temp sensor... both
in the same location between the distributor and the air box, slightly
under, they are pretty much side by side  they have a plug on them that
looks a bit like the plug on the injectors

if this doesn't help a little bit later I will go out and look at my 78
and see if I can find a similar wire...
