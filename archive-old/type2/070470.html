What I did not mention is that, in addition to my wonderful VW Bus,
I have a 1992 Hyundai Excel.  60,000 miles.  I'm starting to get a little
nervous, but there is nothing about the car I do not like.  Just not looking
forward to things like clutches and timing belts.
So I went to the Hyundai Dealer, to see about getting a new Excel.  Maybe
a 4-door this time... Guess what?  They don't make them!!!  What they
make now is so ugly, I couldn't keep from laughing (literally out loud) 
and I told the attack-salesman that I thought all the cars were ugly. 
They were.  

Today I will get the bus back on the road and forget all about &quot;new&quot; cars.

kennedy} I love German cars as used cars, but I can't imagine buying a new German

kennedy} need (multipurpose station wagon, nonhobby) I would look for a used
kennedy} Accord wagon.  Not fast with the four, but very respectable handling and
kennedy} a good highway cruiser.  All the Japanese cars I've owned over the past
kennedy} 12 years or so have needed I think ONE unscheduled maintenance trip *total*
kennedy} for the whole group -- maybe 300-400thousand miles aggregate.  I don't
kennedy} think even BMW or MB would do that, and certainly not at the price.
kennedy} With 120,000 miles on a VW bus, you carry $200 in spares and $400 in
kennedy} tools so that you can build a new VW bus in the Walmart parking lot when
kennedy} it dies.  With 120,000 on a Honda, they give you a third of the purchase
kennedy} price in trade on a new one, unless you want to keep on driving.

kennedy} Don't get me wrong, I love my Vanagon, but I would no more drive to Inuvik
kennedy} in it than I would attempt an Atlantic crossing with it.  And the flip side
kennedy} is I would sooner swap the Vanagon's engine than change the oil on one
kennedy} of the bulletproof Japanese appliance cars.  Two different animals.
