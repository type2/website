&gt; &gt;Can a T2 engine be expected to idle normally (900 RPM) with the points

&gt; &gt;Charles, I have never tried to run one that far out, but IMHO the answer
&gt; &gt;would be &quot;NO!!!&quot;  I would bet money it would not idle at all, much less
&gt; &gt;&quot;well&quot; and would put a gentlemen's bet on it not starting/running
&gt;
&gt; Don't bet the farm. The dwell TIME at 4000 RPM and 50 degree dwell is a
&gt; little over 4 milliseconds. The dwell TIME at 900 RPM and 15 degrees dwell
&gt; is 5.5 milliseconds.

Charles,

Why dwell at 15 degrees would not work... It occurred to me this morning.
It isn't that the coil would not have time to build a charge (tho I think
spark power would be way down), but rather that timing is set after dwell.
If you set dwell at 50 degrees, then set the timing at the correct spec
for your distributor (I will use 7.5BTDC for this example), then in 6
months or a year replace the points with a new set and they start at 15
degrees, the engine will hardly run if at all because the timing will
(I think, check me on this) be advanced by 1/2 the difference between 15
and 50 or 35/2 or 17.5 added to the existing (arguendo) 7.5 or an initial
timing setting of 25 rather than 7.5 BTDC.  If you retimed it at that
point to 7.5BTDC, well, maybe, but at 25BTDC I cannot believe it would
idle.
