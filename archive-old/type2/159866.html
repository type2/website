Subject: Re: [T2] loose cam bearing?

at first I thought this to be usual lifter noise, but it seems to keep 
going after the lifters have pumped up (within 30 seconds the lifters 
usually seem to be quiet.)

it sorta comes and goes when you first start up the motor, when idling. 
you know its there, but its hard to notice at higher rev's.

when the motor gets hot and is running a nice warm high-ish idle, it 
doesn't come up at all. usually just when it's cold and idling low.

I uploaded new files with the sounds my motor is making currently.

Note that this is *after* the lifters have pumped up and stopped making 
any noise. If you listen, not all the time, but sometimes you can hear 
the damn noise just clack clack clacking away.

same sounds, pick your preferred format.

one local guy seems to think it could be a loose cam bearing.
with less than 6k on this rebuild, im hoping for the worst almost, so I 
can take advantage of my warrenty and get whatever it is fixed, because 
that just can't be right.

any thoughts suggestions or general tomfoolery welcomes.

this is an 81 aircooled vanagon, manual trans, AVP rebuild, normal CHT 
(well, normal for the motor 425 at 65 mph on extended drives) normal oil 
pressure (35 at idle) and oil temp seems to be ok.

I have had to re-adjust the points and then the timing the past few 
weekends in a row. Not sure whats throwing them off, but this noise is 
seemingly getting worse.
