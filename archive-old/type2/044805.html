Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Vacuum vs Mechanical

Hi Dave,

Mechanical total advance is what you have under full load full throttle
conditions.  In this state, you will have 0 vacuum.  If you also have a vacuum
advance connected, at full load and full throttle with 0 vacuum, only the
mechanical advance is in play.  The vacuum advance adds in timing advance at
light load conditions resulting in increased fuel economy and a cleaner, more
complete burn.  That is why you can time a combination vac and mech unit to a
total advance of 38 - 40 degrees BTDC and a Mech only unit to 30 - 32 degrees
BTDC at full advance.  More:
The grade and quality of the fuel you use impacts the total advance you can
run.  Adjust your distributor by making full throttle 3rd gear test runs
listening for ping.  Advance timing slightly, make test run.  continue to
advance until ping appears, then back off a few degrees to be under the ping
point of your engine.  Disconnect and plug the vacuum hoses if equipped before
making this adjustment.  There are so many variables even from the factory,
(compression, mixture, plugs, etc.) that the factory specification is usually
just a starting point and it is up to us to find the optimum timing setting for
our own engines.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt;
&gt; Not true on the type IV.  With the dual advance distributor hooked up and
&gt; set to factory specs, there will be around 40 degrees of total advance -
&gt; why should it be different with a mechanical-only distributor?  There is a
&gt; lot of information on this in the archives - I don't feel like doing the
&gt; math again right now.  But know that if you only have 32 degrees total
&gt; advance, you are not running as much advance as VW intended.  That's &quot;one
&gt; of&quot; the problems with the 009 in the type IV - to get enough total advance
&gt; you would have to set it at around 20 degrees BTDC initial, which is of
&gt; course way too much.
