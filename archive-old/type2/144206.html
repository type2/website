Subject: quick jalousie window question

Volks,

I have got a pair of jalousie windows in my parts stash that are coated in
a black substance.  I had always believed that this was Krylon flat black
and just some DPO's &quot;better idea&quot; but I was cleaning up and had a better
look at them while I was moving them around.  The black substance appears
to be some sort of plastic coating and is *very* professionally applied.
As a result, let me ask...  does anyone else have black jalousies?  I
could imagine that VW/Westfalia did some up in black for a Wolfburg
edition or some such thing but this is the only pair I have ever seen.

Steve Dolan
