Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch to flywheel bolts on a 75

215mm flywheels, used on 74-75 models had these bolts..7mm....

They are hard to find sometimes, most Porsche dealers have them as they were
used on 914s..

&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; On inspection of the bolts that hold the pressure plate to the flywheel
&gt; &gt; I found one that has a stripped head. These are 12 point socket heads. 7
&gt; &gt; mm I think. Took one to the local bolt and nut shop, they said what the
&gt; &gt; H--- is that. Don't stock it, can't order it!
&gt;
&gt; 7mm??
&gt; All the type4 clutch bolts I ever put in are 8mm x 1.25 and around 20-25
mm
&gt; long. They have a 13mm hex head on them.
