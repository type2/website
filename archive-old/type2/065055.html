Subject: Re: Doghouse &quot;weatherstripping&quot;?, heat, theory &amp; practice

        On my engine we used plain grey self-adhesive weatherstripping
for an air-seal around the doghouse tin. Your FLVWD can still get
a surprising number of the 'neoprene novelties' Ron Van Ness listed.
        - Ron, I'm keeping that list for reference- thanks!

        I think it was Henry Pellow, the Porsche flat-four guy, who
did a study comparing polished and shiny engines to black and 
thermally emissive ones. Shiny looked good but ran hotter.
        (Late one cool night, a friend with a background in phyics
described herself as 'a lossy system'... see, this kind of knowlege
has applications all over.)

        After I drive the truck home last night, something smelled 
'hot' on the starboard (battery tray) side. Engine hatch was warm to
touch. %)(*$)%)$#% paper tube connecting the fan shroud and
heat exchanger had come loose. Oh heck, how long had that been 
the case??? Should have tried the dipstick test,  but I just
sighed, re-connected the tube, made a mental note to change the oil 
AGAIN. I should never have loosened it in the first place, alas.
