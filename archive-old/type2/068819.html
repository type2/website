&gt;&gt;anything worth while anyway.  Don't lock it, and leave the key in

&gt;Hell, I really can't go with this at all.  I figure that if you've got
&gt;something as beautiful as a vintage bus, then you want to keep it
&gt;beautiful; well, maybe that's just me...?

I have to take a third tack, having attended college in Philadelphia.
Beautiful vintage cars are stolen or vandalized, quickly.  Cars that
are heaped full of crap are broken into on an almost daily basis.
Parking your car on-street in West Philly means that AT LEAST one
person will peer through the windows TONIGHT and EVERY NIGHT, and
they'll take even the most insignificant things (a roll of paper
towels, a cassette, etc.)

I say, keep your ratty old car looking ratty, but keep the inside
totally obstruction-free, so's everyone can see there ain't a thing in
there!  Even $0.47 change lying in the console will be taken within
12 hours, especially if there's a quarter present.  BTDT.  And DON'T
leave your keys in the ignition, EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!  Or else move out
of Philly.

Color me paranoid,
Rodney
