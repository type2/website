I might add the two rubber blocks on the rear bearer bar are inboard, you
can check to see if worn quite easily, but to replace them you'd need to
take off the fan housing, which is quite a job (I don't know if you can do
it with the engine in the camper, any other listees know?)

Whilst mine are still there and do a good job of supporting the static weight,
they are both broken and my engine too &quot;shakes&quot;.

Broken mounts - there are *5* rubber mounting blocks that need
inspection/replacement.  Two at the rear of the engine on the bearer bar,
one at the front of the trans and two over the trans on the trans
hanger. (the two over the trans are present on 79-79 buses, but not on
earlier models)
