&gt; &gt; Yes, I have remembered that part of bus driving.  Hence my desire to move
&gt; &gt; the spare to the front of the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think VW had that add-on in mind when they did their crash testing
&gt; because the body will deform before the bumper can absorb the impact. The
&gt; Euro models had the extended bumper for the tire carrier for a reason: with
&gt; the tire mounted you increase your chance of nose damage if someone
&gt; accidentally backs into you.

yeah but you can't get a 4X8 sheet of plywood in the back with the tire
back there

the real reason my tire is on the front!

besides I &quot;Like&quot; it there kinda neat looking IMO, first option I did to my
bus when I got it.   (it didn't have the VW emblem either)
