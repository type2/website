Subject: Melling oil pump

I just received an order from RMMW of an oil pump for my 83 aircooled 
Vanagon project.  They sent me a Melling heavy duty style pump.  I 
don't think this is going to fit.  The engine carrier that fits over 
it doesn't appear to be able to fit over the extra ears that are on 
this pump.  Does any one have experience with this?

Thanks
