Subject: Belt-eating crank pulley

Still working on this 1500 SP. I noticed that the
inside surface of the crank pulley is pitted and rough
from sitting so long before I got it.  It tends to
shred belts! So, is putting on a new crank pulley as
easy as putting a flywheel lock on, removing the
pulley bolt and simply slapping another one on, or is
it more involved??  Anybody have any tips for this
job??  How many PSI is that sucker supposed to be
cranked to??


Peace, John Baker
