Subject: [T2] Re: Bus-boys ball joints

&gt;&gt;Ball joints were $120.00, labor was $180.00 w/
an additional $45.00 for realignment. 
Labor time charged was 4.0 hours for the job.&lt;&lt;

Jeff,

sounds like you got one heck of a deal to me. even
doing this job myself i still spent about $250+.

take care of that mechanic!

maybe when the bus i have now needs ball joints i will
make the trek across country to get it done. ;-)

happy friday,

Joel Wilson
