Subject: Re: Corvair engines and complete cars

There seems to be a general assumption floating around that Corvairs
and/or their parts are worth as much as equivilent VW cars or parts. My
personal experience has been much different. Several years ago I ended up
with a pair of Corvairs, a Rampside pickup and a Greenbrier van, on the
advice of a friend that these would be useful and valuable additions to my
stable of cars. The short of it is that I decided after much involvement
that I'd rather stick to VWs because I know them so well and have all the
tools and spare parts to keep them up. So I put them up for sale and was
very disapointed that on the open market (eBay) they were worth far less
than an equivalent VW. How much would you expect to pay for a complete
but non running '63 single cab (with extra parts) that needs 2 simple rust
repairs and some other minor body work? In the case of my Rampside, which
is Chevy's attempt to compete with VW for the market, I ended the auction
when it became apparent that it was going to sell for $100.

My experience with parts is similar. I bought original parts and repair
books for $10 each. I bought a complete air conditioning setup for $45.
Standard trim parts are dirt cheap. But, when you start wanting new parts
to do a restoration or rebuild an engine you will find that they are more
expensive than similar VW parts. I'll stick with VWs.

&gt;
&gt; I've got a shed full of Corvair parts (trim, hubcaps, instruments, turbos,
&gt; etc.) I won't use but plan to e-bay eventually. I expect to cover at least
&gt; 1/3 of the cost of the project if not 1/2...
