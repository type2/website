hey! stop using my phone number.

&gt;   hey tony is this why when you buy something at advance auto parts they
&gt; always ask for your tele number? etc etc.....
&gt;   i always thought that was ridiculous... and it never seems to stay in there pc....
&gt;   buy a fuel filter and give them name address telephone number, date of marriage,race,sex, etc etc...

some companies use the information to send catalogs etc. like Radio Shack
and Harbor Freight.   others I think just use the info to build a bigger
dossier.
