Subject: Red Cup Sale at EveryBus (T2 &amp; FMBC fund raiser)

Well, as if everyone else wasn't trying to get your money. Steph (my 
wife) and Leah (calivw78's wife) thought it would be very cool to print 
up some real fancy like cups. So available at Everybus will be real red 
cups.

Adam has very graciously allowed us to use his &quot;red star ale&quot; design and 
logo as the graphic on the side of 22oz. red stadium cups. No need to 
pre order, as we will have plenty. The main point of this whole ordeal 
is to give our kids something to do (and actually to raise some money 
for both fmbc &amp; t2 lists). All profit after we pay for the cups will go 
50/50 to both lists for the continued use of all the fantastic resources 
we have.

Prices will be 2 cups for $5 or a single cup for $3. If you see a group 
of rag-a-muffin kids peddling some red cups with fantastic artwork, 
please buy one (or more). Should you be fortunate to completely miss 
this gaggle of kids, stop by the tiger bus in my avatar at EB and ask to 
get yourself hooked up with the greatest beverage container known to man.

Jason
