Hi.   (not sure if this will post(first time))

I just purchased a '69 campermobile.    Me and my girl thought is was a
good deal.  What a joke. :)  but we have already grown to love it.  It
had so much rust, it's new color is primer, After a solid week of hard
work in the North carolina sun.  we had to section some of the floor and
bondo a lot of it.  (please just don't try to stick a magnet to it)  We
have contained almost all the rust.
This is our first VW.   We may have killed the engine when driving it
home from the washington dc area to the Raleigh .   we have felt
considerable power loss for pushing the engine too hard on that trip.
Any Ideas on what can be done to restore the power?

When i crawled under to look for the first time real good, i noticed the
cv boots were torn.  i assume they need replacing. There was lots of
oil/grease slung in a line on everything near the joints.  What actions
should be taken about that?  The bar that connects the trans. to the
wheel moves back and forth about 2-3 inches.  Is that normal/accetable?
    When I was reconnecting the heater tubing,  I noticed a small line
that was not attached to anything in sight( but it was attached).  It is
about 1/8&quot; diameter,  Hard plastic,  wrapped in some sort of braided
rope covering, and located on the drivers side near the flexible heater
piping.  It came to a T and split into two lines, which did not go
anywhere.  Any ideas on what this is or leads to.
Thanks,

Wayne
