Subject: RE: silver socket on dash

I guess I was lucky (sic) to have owned a '75, since the pump is the one thing I
still use from that Westy.  I learned to hate early fuel injection on The Clone
(it was an orange pop-top, just like jillions of other ones, hence it was dubbed
The Clone by my next-door-camper at the 1982 US Festival in San Bernadino, and
the name stuck).  I really despised that fuel injection when the darn thing
wouldn't start every morning, but when The Clone met its fiery death, that was
the end of my fleeting romance with fuel injection and Bay Windows.  I bought
Sushine, my spartan '64 Westy with a hatch (in 1983) and have had a blissful bus
life since.  I just went and looked at my pump, and the one end plate that is
still on has a VW emblem (the plastic flex hinge gave up the ghost on the other
end), but on further inspection, it is actually a Coleman, though I didn't
notice if it is American or German made, but the cheap construction leads me to
believe that it is American origin.  The Clone also had the full size spare on
the nose, so at the time I owned it the purpose of the pump escaped me, since it
doesn't move enough air for anything but bicycle tires, or topping up full size
tires (its most common use).  Since the plug fits both the silver socket and a
standard cigarette, I can use it on Sunshine and on the Detroit junk my wife is
cursed with ('86 Mustang).

Happy trails,
terry
