&gt; The one remaining question it leaves me with is: If the bus is a
&gt; Westy, does
&gt; the rear seat vent and control disappear? This is the one control
&gt; (and vent
&gt; for that matter) that I haven't been able to locate.

Since the seat is in a slightly different place, I think that the rear
heat vent is not installed, at least in the campers I've seen at the
wrecker.  Panel vans don't get them either, as I recall.  I don't know
about Kombis.
