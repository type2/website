Subject: 71 a-wagen parts for sale

List,
I'm trying to move a couple things that i thought i
had sold.  All of these are packed and ready to ship.

I have a full set of beltline aluminum trim from a 71
bus.  A fellow over in the UK wanted it, so i packed
it all in bubble wrap and...i never heard from him
again.
The set is complete. I think i may have lost 2 or
three clips to rust during removal. The others are
packed.  Its not the shiniest in the world, but its
not too bad. There is at least one ding on a piece and
some scratches on the piece that came off the driver
door.  There is one piece that has a little over spray
from some primer. It is all securely bubble wrapped
and packed tight in a heavy cardboard box. I have no
pics - sorry.. Please don't make me unpack it!
Make me an offer - be reasonable, now. 

I have the rear engine hatch from the same 71 bus.
Super condition, if a little dirty. It is that pale
yellow color that some adventurewagens and other
busses were painted in the early 70s.
Also packed and ready to ship.
Again - make me an offer i can't refuse.

I have the adventurewagen step that was in place on
these machines in the early 70s.  It is maybe a couple
feet wide and can be retracted up under the bus when
not in use.  I tried to sell it to a listmember, but
everything she sends me comes back to her for some
reason. Gail, if you're reading this and still want it
i'll sell to you before anyone else.  Maybe we can use
UPS?
I need $40 for this extremely cool adventurewagen-only
accessory.
The best way to contact me is by phone -
(606)780-4042
I don't get to check email much anymore...

I had a tranny failure recently and could use the
income to finance the rebuild. Help me get back on the
road for the FMBC dixie bus gathering!

My bus is currently serving as overflow post-party
housing out at the inlaws...i'm the only one who's
used it so far. Everyone wonders why i prefer it over
the house. Hard to explain...

Danke,
clark gordon
Morehead, ky
