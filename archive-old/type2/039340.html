Subject: Looking for Tour Box Mementos

Dear Folks,

At last we have a Venerable Keeper of the Tour Box Memorabilia! Actually
they are two persons, Dave and Diane Burden of Woodstock, GA, list members
and former Great Bus Tour participants.

Thank you Dave and Diane!!! Three Cheers!

So now that these kind folks have volunteered to keep and catalogue all the
memorabilia, we need those of you who were kind enough to clean out the Tour
Box from time to time so that there would be more room, to let me know who
you are so I can send you the money to ship the items to Dave and Diane!

Please contact me at pearlgrl_at_bellsouth_dot_net and we will make arrangement to
get the memorabilia to the Tour Box Treasure Room.

Thanks for your continued interest and help!

Chris and Gus in Atlanta
