Stephen:

&gt;i need to either buy a good right
&gt;and a good left backing plate, or
&gt;have someone tell me a good way to
&gt;seal those mangled holes up.

Good backing plates are hard to come by.  I've never seen anything but
salvaged ones offered for sale.  I rehabilitated mine by welding
appropriately sized washers over the original holes to restore the round
shape and provide a slightly beefier edge against which to operate a
brake adjusting implement.

You may want to just use a good durable tape to cover the holes.
