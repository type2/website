&gt;Told an old
&gt; time VW shop about it, and he said, synthetic oil will not pump up VW
&gt; hydraulic lifters, they will collapse. I took a chance and bought it with
a
&gt; lowball offer. Changed the oil to dino 20W50, what a change, purred like a
&gt; kitten. It had an ace motor. Watch out for synthetic oils in VW's in my
&gt; limited experience. Let me know if this helps. Tom

Sorry to shoot down your theory, but I have synthetic in my '79 (hydraulic
lifters) and they pump up just fine.

Not any faster or slower than with dino oil, just the same.  Mine have to
sit for a good long time before the lifters will bleed down though, and of
course it also doesn't help that I park on a fairly steep hill.  Let it sit
for a couple weeks and a lifter or two will bleed down and make a horrible
racket but by the time I get to work they are pumped up and good to go
again.
