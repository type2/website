I don't want to get into a pissing contest either!!!!!

You can run your business any way you wish.

I would just like some one to issue me the credit that Jerry promised 
me a month ago and that I have requested from your company in now 
eight email messages.

By the way I did return Dan's call but I am fairly busy right now and 
I do not feel it is my responsibility to pay for being placed on 
endless &quot;ignore&quot; when it is your mistake that caused this.


Jerry has been very gratious in answering his Email but evidently he 
has no authority to solve the situation.  No one else has bothered to 
respond to my emails until your diatribe.

Just issue me the credit that was promised a month ago and we can go 
on with our lives.

As a small independent businessman for now 40 years, I know your 
frustration, but I feel you need to get a handle on what is really 
causing you grief. I am not the enemy.  I am a customer that expects 
good customer service.  I don't feel I got it from you in this case. 
You can make your company thrive or you can make it fail.  It's up to 
you.
