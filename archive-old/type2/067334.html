Subject: RE: Golf Balls (no VW)

I'm told that the cuts and grazes on the original golf balls made the ball
rotate and therefore (due to aerodynamics that I don't understand) go further.

This is emmulated by the dimples on the golf balls. 

Best flight is achieved when the ball is rotating in the line of flight. A
rotation which is not in the line of flight will cause the ball to swing to the
side. 
Also the pattern of dimples should be symetrical on each side of a plane at 
right angles to the axis of the rotation of the ball

Traditional dimpled golf balls have only one plane of symetry. More modern 
designs have the dimples arranged in pentagonal patterns giving more lines of
symetry and making it easier to hit the ball further.

I don't play golf but I think the only the traditional design of dimples on
balls is allowed in professional tournaments to prevent the game becoming 'too
easy' for them.

PS Why do I know this 'useless' information? :-)
