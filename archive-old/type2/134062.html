Subject: funny horn story

recently, my horn began to beep, unbidden. not uncommon; but as i 
wrote the horn-wire replacement chapter in the library, it was a mite 
embarrassing!
started out as more of a twitch in the steering wheel - i felt the 
horn vibrate more than heard it. veeeeeeeeeeeery slowly got worse, 
and was sporadic. finally, it started beeping whenever i turned the 
wheel, either direction.

got home; examined. no problems at horn button. wire has soda straws 
all down the length of steering column, liquid latex on all exposed 
areas, rubber grommets every so often. hmmm.

look under bus - no obvious problems at steering box end.... except.

like many bussers, i have a sheet of tin laid on the floorboard to 
cover some swiss cheese; this tin had slowly crept forward until it 
began to &gt;just&lt; poke into the hole where the steering column passes. 
the nuts holding the coupler disk would then brush against it, 
grounding the horn system! sometimes getting in would push the tin 
farther into the hole, making it beepier; sometimes it would pull 
back, and the problem would mysteriously vanish. finally, it stuck in 
far enough to make a solid contact each time the nuts went by, 
leading to  my examination.

time for some screws  ;)
