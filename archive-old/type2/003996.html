Well, the conversion issue is a definite possibility. Particularly with the
Westy plate. The VIN is not on the dash, but is behind the *passenger's*
seat, not the driver's seat. The VIN plate looks original, i.e., does not
look like it has been moved at all. The Westy plate...not sure. As I
mentioned, the veneer color is too dark, so I can't be sure what is going
on. The only cabinetry left is the base of the bed (where the plate is
located), and a center console thing (cup holders and all) in the same
veneer as the bed base. The console fits directly between the two front
seats. Since I don't recall ever seeing a center console called for in a
'69, I don't think it's original, and since it matches the veneer on the bed
base exactly, I wonder about the lineage. As for the Westy plate, here's the
info:

SO 57
Fabrik no.: 019xx (can't read last two digits)
1969

So, at the minimum, the plate year for the bed base and the model year of
the bus match.

This may be rude or stupid, but are you positive the bus in question is
indeed a Westy original and not a bus converted, that would explain the
differences in the location of certain items.  Also I've seen people go as
far out as cutting the engine (attached metal) out and replacing other vins
to bypass a rebuilders title or legal battle.  I know this may not be the
case, but a lot of these items in question are explained by how I use to
ship
these things out of Germany, using the loophole system.  Any more questions
feel free.  And I don't know about other states, but a lot of the California
entry Westfalia Buses have a set of plates issued to them by the department
of housing, like an RV, to show it has been inspected and is original at
time
of entry.  Now I know mine is a California rust free bus, but when we
noticed
the plates missing and ran the numbers it came back as the port of entry
being Florida?  Go figure, But you've got to figure that for as many of
these
bad boys that remain on the road, many rules and ideas have been broken or
invented to keep the (GOOD FEELING) buses on the road.
Peace Out
