Subject: Diesal (sp?)

I saw a different van today - a pre-water cooled era diesal? Like 82 -
83?

$4500, has a rebuilt engine.


&gt;
&gt; 1986 Westfalia, champagne, $9,000. I guess it
&gt;  it has the newer engine.

This van was leaking oil from the fly wheel.

&gt;
&gt;  ...and a 1985 for $7,000, white, with the &quot;straight-up&quot; poptop?

This van had a full camper installation and had no rebuilds at 190,000.

Andree
