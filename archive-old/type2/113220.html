Subject: SOLVED - Re: [T2] zero endplay

using a washer on the engine stand that's a wee bit too big will cause
just a few problems ;)

I think what it was doing was holding the flywheel at an angle when I
bolted it on.  That's why I was getting the rubbing on the no. 1 bearing
just opposite the mount point.

well, that was thoroughly annoying! ;)

Welp, off to the machine shop to have them fix my stripped oil cover
threads...
