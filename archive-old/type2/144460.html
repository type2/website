Subject: rusting, ?abandoned bus on side of road in Maine

Located on Rt 218 in Whitefield, Maine,
just outside of Whitefield as you head
north on 218.

I know nothing about this; pictures sent
to me by a friend who suggested that surely
I could not let this thing sit there.

I'll leave the photos up a few days.  If
you wanna know more, I can maybe ask the 
guy who found it for somewhat more precise
location instructions, but he said it was
visible from the road which is how he found
it.  Mighty, mighty pretty part of the world
around there (Alna, Damariscotta Mills, and
Head Tide) if looking for an excuse for a
ramble.
