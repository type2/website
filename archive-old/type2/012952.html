X-Envelope-To: type2

Hello all, 
  I will hopefully,yet reluctantly, be departing from
the company of my bus this weekend. I am giving John
Erickson first dibs at buying the bus....but if he is
not interested it is up for grabs. I have an add
posted on the for sale board _at_type2_dot_com. 
  I just wanted to get the word out if anyone wanted
to take advantage of a great deal coming this weekend.
  Can't wait for the weekend :)  Safe travels all!!!
Jeff 73 transporter NC.
