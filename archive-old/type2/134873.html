Subject: Headlights?

Really basic question here:

I noted yesterday that one of my headlights went out.  I'm hoping that it's 
just the bulb, so I'm going to pick up a couple of replacements today on the 
way home after work today.  But it occurs to me, I've never replaced a 
headlight bulb before.  Are these standard sockets?  Can I just pick up any 
random bulb at an auto parts store?

thanks,

-mike
