&gt; &gt; I have a '76 FI westy and was wondering the best way to route

&gt; &gt; wise to &quot;T&quot; into the FI ring since it is pressurized at 
&gt; &gt; 30 or so psi so I &quot;T'd&quot; into the line coming out of the tank
&gt; &gt; before the FI fuel pump, but when I tried to run the heater 
&gt; &gt; it acted as though it wasn't recieving fuel.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this is ok, since I'll be doing the same thing when I finally
&gt; get around to installing mine.
&gt; 

that's how I did mine and it worked no problem
