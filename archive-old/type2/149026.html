Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor-coil conundrum

She's running again.  Thanks for the advice and ideas.  Let me say 
that, as with so many things in life, I'm not quite sure what happened. 
  I do know that I was getting a steady 12v at the *negative* side of 
the terminal; turning the engine crank didn't change that through 360 
degrees.  I decided to switch back to the 009 and see what happened, 
and when I did, the engine ran as expected, and the static light went 
on and off as usual.  The new SVDA came with points and a condenser, 
and I was going to be rational and hook up the SVDA stock before 
switching to the CompuFire, but given the problem I had at first, I 
decided to go for broke and install the CompuFire.  Then I put the SVDA 
back in the engine.  And it worked just fine.  I set the initial timing 
with the static light, as per the instructions that came with the 
distributor.  Then I started the engine, warmed it up, and fine-tuned 
the timing with the gun.

So that's the story.  I'm wondering if I might have not had the 
distributor seated all the way down (and thus the rotor wouldn't turn) 
or whether the points/condenser were bad.  I just don't know, and I'm 
not going to try to reproduce it.  The bus is running, and I'm happy.

What's especially nice about this list, I've found, is that one never 
feel alone, at least while working on the bus.  Thanks, folks.

See you on the road,
Jerry
