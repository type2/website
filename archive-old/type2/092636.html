Subject: Re: [T2] Starter problem

Get a Genuine Bosch reman. Get the SR17X. It costs more than the SR15X but 
is much huskier and you can expect up to 20 years of no more problems. 
There is just nothing like nipping this in the bud and putting this issue 
out of your life for certain.

Fix it right and be done with it.
