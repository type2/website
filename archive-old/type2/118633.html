Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS camping spot needed in South Dakota, Iowa

  Thanks for the e-mail, very important information.  Amanda had called last
night and she is very knowledgable about safety issues but the parent in me
went over the list.
  No rest areas, stay in highly populated areas for stops.  She's on her way,
connected with the Buskatiers but your advice is well received and should be
followed by all

        I'm not on the way... but. just want to issue a word of caution...
above all. tell her NOT to stop in a rest stop.. like the ones along the
highway/interstates.  They can be very dangerous..... -------
