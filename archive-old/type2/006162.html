Subject: Mexico Topes and Propane Tank Clearance

Hey Gang,

I've been planning a 3 month trip to Mexico and I'm worried about the stock
propane tank under my 79 Westy.  There is only about 8 inches of clearance
between the skid plate and terra firma and I'm afraid one of Mexico's
notorious topes (speed bumps) or a huge pot hole will sneak up me and cause
a catastrophy.

Does anyone have any first-hand experience involving close encounters
between stock propane tanks and bad roads?

I have considered replacing the under-vehicle tank with a 1 gallon
inside-vehicle tank.  If I decide to do this, I would vent the relief valve
out the bottom of the vehicle with a hose and seal the storage place so that
it's air-tight.  But it still makes me nervous and I don't want to do it
unless it's really necessary.

Any suggestions will be appreciated,
