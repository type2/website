Subject: Engine woes

Well, it has come down to the point that I need to replace my engine in my 74
westy.  The case busted where the long bolt that goes between both halves and
is the mount for the oil sump.  Well, it was previously broken and a piss poor
repair was done.  This engine I got from AVP and due to the above, I'm really
not keen on using them again.  I was wondering if there is any way to increase
the power on this bus while still maintaining the stock equipment or should I
just stick with the 1800.  This is an automatic westy, and thus, born slow.
Wouldn't mind getting a bit more power out of it.  Staying with a 1800, all
the parts more than likely can be reused since the rebuild was done less than
20k miles ago.  So, who would you guys recommend me to go to where I can work
with them on what I want/already have?  I have a starter case that I'm
assuming is useable, since it came out of the bus and was running when I put
the AVP in.

Sincerely,
Ed Woenker
