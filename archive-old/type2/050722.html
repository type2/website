Subject: [T2] Timing Marks

Hello

I have a '72 camper. The timing mark scale at some point became dislodged
from its position on the fan housing and is nowhere to be found. There are 6
tiny notches on the fan housing where the scale once was. I am wondering if
these  notches were created at the factory, and if so, whether anyone can
tell me what degrees for the purposes of timing these notches indicate. Does
anyone know from where I might obtain a replacement timing scale?

Thanks
