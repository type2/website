Subject: ?Flush the engine + camber/alignment adjustment?

Hi All,

&gt;Flush the engine once every 5 or 6 oil changes... to get the scum out.

How do you flush the engine?


My '73 takes me to work, 45 miles round trip, 5 days a week.  (Until
the light rail out to where I work is finished:)  I may be tempting
fate here, but I've had almost a problem free year with my bus!!  The
last thing to go wrong was last Thanksgiving I had to replace the
alternator.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but I am also doing what
I can to keep it up, oil changes, valve adjustments, tune-up stuff.  I
even repacked the CV joints.  Oh, I did have to reseat the left rear
taillight bulb two weeks ago.

It does pull to the right though.  I took it to midas for an alignment
(boy that was a nervous day, the first time in a year and a half
anyone beside Amelia or I did any work on the car).  He said the
camber was out (I think it was camber, not caster) and needed
adjusting but he didn't have the tool.  Anyone been there and have any
advice.  Should I find someone with the tool to do it.  Its my
impression that without the fancy alignment laser/computer stuff, you
can't really do a bang up job of alignment yourself.

take care,
        brandy
