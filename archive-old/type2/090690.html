Subject: Re: [T2] Painting question

Why not quit listening to the list and go to a NAPA store, I think a
$195.00 gravity feed spray gun is what you need. You do not need a high
dollar *airless system*.
Many times I just drive around to a few backyard body shops and ask what
they're using. 
Check out the cleaning procedures on whatever you buy, simple is better
when you only use the gun twice a year.

perfect for my needs.. happily also the state-of-the-art way 
&gt; of being environment friendly and doing a nice job, too. It looks 
&gt; like these systems go for around $600 to $800, and they are very 
&gt; compact. Can you make any other recommendations regarding the 
&gt; relative quality of different brands? Are systems now much better 
&gt; than older, used ones? Any other comments or tips? 
&gt; Thanks in advance! Jan B
