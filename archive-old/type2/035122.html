Subject: evap. bus water cooling

&lt;If you want your air cooled bus water assisted I suggest you move to
&lt;the Pacific North West. We ar supposed to have wet soggy weather for
&lt;the next decade or so!

or perhaps just go buy a rabbit/golf etc.

i thought part of the draw of air-cooled was its simplicity.  lets
make it more simple by adding a elec. fan/oil cooler.  no wait that is
not enough....now lets add a garden hose system of misting water to
cool the engine.  ok ok ...a little mockery don't get to upset.
