Subject: Broken valve spring Some answers
Message-ID: &lt;7lnm2j$hk87_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Some time ago I had some question on how
to replace a valve spring with the engine in
place.

I got several good answers, Thank You, that
saved me a lot of trouble.

Here is one of them, with my comments.
from: GENTERY Mc Cormick:
( hope you don't mind me quoting you )

&gt; they can be changed [one] in about
&gt; 15 minutes.
&gt; 1-go to sears tool section and a valve
&gt;    spring compressor, about $15.00
&gt;   it looks like a strange gear pulled
&gt;   its on the rack with the valve tools.
&gt;   if you pay more you are geting the
&gt;   wrong one.

No sears here, and the man at the auto
spare store only had the kind of spring 
compressor you use when the top is of.
So I made one from a piece of iron tube
D42mm d36mm l62mm and 3 4mm screws.
I put it over the spring
and pushed it down using a crowbar. One of
the ribs on my &quot;naked&quot; heat exchanger was
perfect to hold against.

&gt; 2- you need a compression tester
&gt;     that screws into the plug hole
&gt;     and has a fitting to connect to
&gt;     the compressed air supply.

Made an adapter from a plug and an old
tool for compressed air. The main problem
was to get the ceramics out from the plug.
Put together with plastic metal.

&gt; 3- bring the piston to top of strock
&gt; 4- connect tester into plug hole
&gt;      and put the cylinder pressure
&gt;      to hold the valve seated.
&gt; 5- install valve spring tool on the
&gt;      spring, turn screw to compress
&gt;     spring, remove the keepers and
&gt;     the broken spring,keeping the cyl
&gt;     under pressure so the valve will
&gt;     seated.
&gt; 6- coat the valve stem groves that hold
&gt;     the keepers with grease or vaseline
&gt;     if you dont have grease.
&gt; 7- put the retainer on the new spring
&gt;     and connect the spring compressor
&gt;     and install spring over valve.
&gt;     install keepers they will adhere to
&gt;     to the valve stem with the grease
&gt;     in the grooves.
&gt; 8- slowly release the tension on the spring
&gt;     remove tool and air hose and its done
&gt;     put the rockers on adjust valves and
&gt;     button up

Once again, thanks
