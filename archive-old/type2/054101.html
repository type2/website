TIG would be nice..but a small MIG should be plenty for Vdubb work. I got an 
inexpensive Clarke (Canadian/British/Ohio ?)last year, and it works like a 
champ. Uses the better style of tips..so you can find all the consumables 
you need locally. Also has a short, but good, how-to video.  If you have a 
chance,a community college course will really speed up the learning curve. 
Had a good time in mine too...ever hang around 6-8 rabid NASCAR fans before 
they've had their morning coffee? (This IS NC!!)

Good luck
