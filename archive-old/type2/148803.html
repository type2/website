Subject: RE: [T2] Friend broken down in Grand Junction, CO

We have Greg's 69 Westy at our place now so we can work on it a little
easier.  One of the quickest options we have to get him back on the road is
to possibly take a 1600 SP out of a Double Cab and stick that in his 69
Westy.  First question is, should this be pretty straight forward?  I have
only worked on type 4's and have not done much with type 1's.

We have come to a conclusion that the bottom end on his existing engine is
probably shot.  We tried to manually rotate the engine with a wrench and we
can get it to move about an eighth of an inch either way before in binds.
This same thing happens when we used the starter for a short crank.

We are planning on doing this tomorrow if we decide to go with it so any
input is appreciated.  Let me know if I need to give any more info.

Thanks,

Troy Wical

Any Type 2'ers who might be able to help out a friend of mine whose  
'69 Westy has broken down (possibly major engine trouble, although  
the jury is still out on that, IMO) in Grand Junction, CO?
