Hi Mark,

Word came back from the Buskatiers that it was last seen in Columbia,  
MO. We're still waiting to hear back from the guy who had it.

If there are any list-members near there, possibly headed to  
Everybus, perhaps we could send it home with Troy and get it out to  
the west-coast for a while.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
