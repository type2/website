&gt;Thanks to everybody that helped with my turn signal and starting problems, it
&gt;was great advice.  I have a question for everybody on this list, I'm just
&gt;curious.  I myself have been pulled over by the police 3 times in the last 6
&gt;months I have been driving my bus.  I haven't gotten any tickets though.  I
&gt;was just wondering if other people have this problem too, and I was curious
&gt;as to what states it is the worst in.  I live in central Illinois where the
&gt;cops have nothing better to do, so maybe thats why.  I always get stupid
&gt;excuses too when I get pulled over such as, &quot;umm...I couldn't see your
&gt;license plate..&quot;  Just curious..

I'd love to talk about it but I don't think this is an acceptable topic for
the list... except possibly for Friday.  How do I know?  Well, cause I
contributed last time this topic came up and promptly heard about it (hi
Steve! :-)).
