Subject: Help, Type IV Valve Seat Problem

In pulling the heads off of the type IV motor that is being used for
the  conversion into a Thing.  We found somthing on the valve seats that
I'm hoping that someone could shed some light on.

The valve seat has a grove of almost 3/16&quot; in diameter and the valve in
the area that was coming in contact with this part of the seat has
indentations.  It looks as if someone dropped a bolt down the intake
where it got wedged between the valve and the valve seat.  Continued
pounding by the valve would have then wore a grove into the seat.  There
are no scratches in the engine, the piston, cylinder and exhaust valve
look fine.  Its almost like someone found the bolt, removed it and then
bolted it up again until they decided to ship the entire bus to the
wrecking yard.

Remember, there is a big grove in the seat and corresponding
indentations (although smaller) in the valve, just like would happen if
a bolt was wedged in there.  (This was cyl #1)

Does this sound possible?

I have posted a photo at http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/engine3.JPG or 
the hole page (bunch of other photos to)

Any other ideas?

FYI, cyl #3 had its spark plug hole tapped out and the spark plug had a
reducing collar attached to it.  The hole was not tapped all the way
down and the plug stopped almost 1/2&quot; up in the head.  The head shows
signs of incomplete combustion as a result.

Looks like this engine was running on about 2.75 cylinders when it was
put to pasture.


Thanks
Scott
