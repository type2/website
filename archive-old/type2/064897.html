A carefully blueprinted engine WILL develope more power. Check out 
http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/ to see Bob Hoover's sermons. He covers 
most of the topics. I saw the reverse happen when our new van blew its 
engine at 45K. Before the rebuild (the only salvagable part was the 
block), the van would do 70, afterwards it wouldn't get over 65.
