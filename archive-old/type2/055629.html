Subject: RE: Mexican 1600dp longblock group purchase

At the Puyallup show vendors had both Mexican and Brazilian new Type 1 1600 DP 
longblock engines.  Same specs, etc., but built in different countries, and 
same price of around $1200.00.

EXCEPT, the Brazilian longblocks allegedly have a different, and better, alloy 
in their crankcase castings.

The one vendor I talked to that had the Brazilian engines said they'd changed 
to them from the Mexican engines because of the improved case alloy, and that 
they were quite pleased with the change.  They've done some custom 
modification on these engines and have found that the Brazilian cases machine 
much more cleanly than the Mexican cases and that the difference was obvious 
when you get inside the cases.

This is obviously heresay information.  Can anyone confirm these allegations, 
and provide details on the different case alloys?  Inquiring minds want to 
know.....
