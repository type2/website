     Could it be that not everyone in the US can actually afford to own and 
     drive one or more automobiles?  Of course not.  That would make us 
     like the rest of the world.  What was I thinking.  We're Americans.  
     It says right there in the Constitution or the Bill or Rights , or 
     somewhere like that, that every American has the right to own and 
     drive the car of their choice.
     
     The auto manufacturers would not be allowed to operate a 20 yr old 
     plant without updating it (or at least I would like to believe so), so 
     why should the consumers be allowed to operate the 20yr old cars 
     without the same requirements?  
     
     The time has come for the older cars to go the way of horses and burn 
     barrels.  How many cities will allow you to ride your horse down the 
     street leaving horse shit all over the place?  How many cities allow 
     you to burn trash and old tires in your yard?  Why should they allow 
     you to accomplish the same result with your old car?  And calling it a 
     hobby doesn't make it any cleaner or less dangerous.
     
     By the way, as far as I know, you still have a choice about living in 
     California.  Unless, of course,  you're in prison there.  Do the 
     provide cars for the inmates to drive?  If they don't, the inmates 
     should sue.  That would truly be cruel and unusual punishment.
