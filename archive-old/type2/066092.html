        Not many of the new street rods are 30's model cars.  Most are new
manufacture home builts.  If you ever pick up a copy of Kit Car you will see
that this emmision stuff is an ongoing concern for them too.

        For the first time a civilized 
        nation has full gun registration!
        Our streets will be safer,
        our police more efficient,
        and the world will follow
        our lead into the future!&quot;
