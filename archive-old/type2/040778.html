&gt;   Quick question. Do J-tubes take the place of heat exchangers? If so, what is the advantage/disadvantage? I'm assuming the decision will drasticly affect the heating and/or cooling system of the bus. 

J tubes do take the place of heat exchangers, they are not commercially
avaliable for all type 2 engines.  I have em and made my own.

the major advantage is the engine is lighter and there is more room to get
to &quot;Stuff&quot; disadvantage is there is no &quot;Stock&quot; heat.

I did it because I had no real heat system left, it was mostly rust and
fell apart when I touched it.  Also I had a gas fired aux heater so I set
it up as my sole heater.

however I also believe that the easiest and simplest way is to go stock if
you can.  I almost had no choice and had to imagineer, design, and build
a heating system from scratch. so if you want heat it is not for the faint
of heart
