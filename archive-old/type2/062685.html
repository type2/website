Subject: all kinds of 70 westy questions

Hello, all.
 
After an e-mailless summer, I am back in school with lots of questions 
about my 1970 Westy.  First of all, at the beginning of the summer, I 
thought I was going to sell her, but after nothing I liked better that I 
could afford any more easily than her came along, I decided (with much 
persuasion from my S.O.) to keep her and go along with the restoration 
project.

She now has a 74 bug engine that runs very well, newly repaired and 
multi-colored body, good transmission, and lots of other great things 
going for her, but the brakes are being done.  Since I have found during 
this project that I am not as mechanically inclined or motivated as I 
hoped I would be, I have friends doing most of the work.  I need a ball 
joint and have noticed some big price differences between Brazilian and 
Mexican parts.  I know sometimes you really get what you pay for and 
sometimes there really isn't a whole lot of difference.  What about with 
ball joints?  Is the less expensive part good enough?  

Also, I now need to think about painting.  Funds are extrememly limited 
at this point and right now the assorted colors of primer and Bondo look 
kinda funny, but not funny enough to be a huge priority.  Is there a way 
to postpone painting until spring maybe and still prevent further rust, 
etc?  My friend (who is just as inexperienced in this as I) suggested 
priming it for now until I can do a better paint job.  What does everyone 
think?  And about painting yourself, what would be the least expensive 
but still nice-looking route?  I'm not trying to do an original job at 
all, I just need transportation.  But I have also been wondering, what 
were the original colors for a 70 pop-top?  I have been thinking about 
what color to go with when I'm not busy thinking about more important 
things and I'm not sure.  The interior is gold and it has the standard 
gold and green plaid curtain.  What colors are better for concealing 
far-from-perfect body work?

And while I'm rambling, here's a complaint:  If J.C.Whitney says you will 
get your order in 5-6 (or whatever it is) working days, why don't you get 
your order in 5-6 working days?  Is that too much to ask?  Is it 
reasonable to have a part backordered for 2 months?  I don't think so.

O.K. I'm done now.  It's nice to be back.

Amy :)

And one more thing:  What's the best way to remove the front doors?  26 
years of grime and goo and rust is making the job EXTREMELY difficult.  
The impact driver hasn't even done much!
