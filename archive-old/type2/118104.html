Subject: Re: [T2] Changing from Drums to Disc Brakes

In a message dated 10/20/03 1:59:57 PM, Dean.Landi_at_noaa_dot_gov writes:

&lt;&lt; I drive a 72 Bus and was wondering if it would be possible to change the
rear drum brakes to disc?  At the moment I am going to have to put new
wheel cylinders on both sides.  Any help with both operations?

Dean &gt;&gt;

I've &quot;seen&quot; it done on a real flash Beetle, but not on a Bus...Unless there's
a kit of some form or other I'd tend to think it's gonna be really tough...
figuring out what will fit...It'd hafta be from something with rear discs al-
ready with some form of emergency brake since swapping out a front disc
would leave you without an emergency brake...Also you probably would need
some way to &quot;balance&quot; the front/rear pressure to keep one end of the Bus
from locking before the other...
