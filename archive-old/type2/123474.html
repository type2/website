Subject: Seat Stand/Pedestal  Mats

Greetings fellow bussers,

I have new replacement seat stand mats made by WCM I think. Problem is that 
they don't fit.  They are not the right shape. They are cut too low in the 
back (vertical surface) behind the seat stand above the large oval 
indentation. Furthermore, the overall design is different than original. The 
repo set is two peices of rubber whereas the original had three I think. 
Missing and somewhat combined in the two peices is the skinny peice that 
totally covers the rear of the top (horizontal surface).

They will work for the drivers side, but only because the cabinet and spare 
tire compartment will hide the missing rubber. But what to do about the 
passenger side? At first I thought it was just the Westy seat swivel base 
that had things being different but yesterday in my local junkyard I noticed 
that all the passenger busses had the exact same shape seat stand/pedestal 
as the westy.

Are the mats I have for an earier bus that take a dip in the back?I looked 
in WCM online and didn't see any other sets.  Anyone make mats that fit and 
don't leave 3&quot; to spare?  Any ideas other than searching for the rest of my 
life in junkyards accross the nation in hopes of finding decent non-torn 
originals?

Thanks,
Brandt
