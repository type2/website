Steve,

You've prompted a massive search (unsucessful) through many boxes which remain
unpacked since our May move from Puerto Rico to Milwaukee. Somewhere I have
templates/drawings of a hich which would suit your needs, and I will keep
looking. I just didn't want this thread to die out before I responded. 
I have only seen one type of hitch that fits the 69-72 without any
modifications. It goes like this:
Look onder the rear of the van at the &quot;frame&quot; where the bumper brackets bolt up.
They are attached to the bottom of the member. Now look at the side of the
member directly above the bumper brackets. There are three holes with nuts
welded inside the frame. In a '72 with type IV engine, they're directly behind
where the rear engine support bolts to the frame. These are the attachment
points for the hitch. Brackets are fashioned which basically replace the bumper
brackets (they have provisions on them for reattaching the bumper) and support a
box channel that fits inside the rear bumper. Welded in the center is a u-shaped
piece of steel bar that goes under the bumper and back up to a point about even
with the middle of the bumper and about 3-4&quot; behind it. The ball was is an
integral part of the U-shaped bar. This is a real neat setup, as it provides
additional protection in the event of a rear impact.
I have seen these for sale at swap areas in VW shows. I am a similar one made as
soon as I can find the *_at_!_at_$ box my templates are in, and I will be happy to
provide copies of the drawings to any who desire them.
