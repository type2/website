Subject: ecu schematic

 
Chuck, 

I have a book I believe is called &quot;bosch fuel injection systems&quot;, can't remember the author's name, which may be the best resource. I've looked thru it only lightly, as of yet, but being in elec. engineering trade, I would imagine a complete schematic would've stuck in my head.

Will take a look at lunchtime. (west coast time)

Billy
