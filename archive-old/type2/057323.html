Hello World - Please help! 

I am at  the end of all my wits and I if I don't solve this I will have to
find a mechanic!
Sorry it's a long story, but any suggestions appreciated.

I have a 1.8 dual carb engine (AP that's a European AW I think)

About a week ago, just after fixing the brakes, the tail pipe fell off - while
looking
for another the engine began to loose power around 30 - 40mph.

couldnt find a tail pipe - needed a new system - change it -OK
I alos refitted a bit of tin that runs up passed the fuel pump - (the PO
seemed to think the tin was not needed, that was the last bit missing.)

Over the last week the loss of power has got worse, until we just about made
it back from the supermarket on Thursday, since then I have - one at a time:

Replaced
the Contact breaker points (looked like they had exploded)
the condenser 
Plug leads
Coil
Distributer cap

checked (several times ) the static timing (as per Muir)
checked and rechecked the plugs
done a valve job - all OK.

Replaced the CB points again, because, I assumed the faulty condenser had
destroyed the second set (they were badly pitted - only a day old)

No unusual sounds.
It still runs, but has no power and seems to get worse the further I go, I
also think
its running hot, as in I drove it about a mile last night and the dipstick was
almost too hot to touch?

What next? - my VW specialist is in town about 4 miles away? - I am not sure
if it will get there.
 
Any suggestions gratefully recieved - Please PMail me as I am on digest

Thanks
