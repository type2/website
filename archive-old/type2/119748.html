Subject: Re: [T2] Is this a bled-down hydraulic lifter?

&gt; &quot;Eeek, do I have a loose rocker?  What the hell is that?&quot;, I think.

&gt; They said that it's totally possible for even a new lifter to bleed
&gt; down with that type if interval between trips (my trips tend to be
&gt; short right now, as well).
&gt;
&gt; A friend and I went out to record the noise:
&gt;
&gt; 	http://www.shagadelic_dot_org/VW/bus-knocking.wav
&gt;
&gt; Is this the sort of noise that bled-down lifters make?  I guess perhaps
&gt; I should just drive it around for a while and see if the lifter pumps
&gt; back up and the noise goes away.  Or should I first pull off the valve
&gt; covers and inspect the valvetrain?  Or am I just being too paranoid?

Yes, that ticking is exactly the sort of sound a bled-down lifter makes.
I am presuming that the high whine I hear is the clipping you refer to but
the ticking is 99% sure to be a lifter.  If the ticking has not
disappeared after 20 minutes or so of gentle driving then the other
possibility is that the lock nut on one of the adjusters has come loose
and the adjuster is backing itself out. If this is the case then the tick
will get worse during the 20 minutes and it may be joined by a random
banging as the lock nut comes off the adjuster screw.  This is obviously
cause to stop driving the bus :-) The second is very very unlikely
however.  Drive it and I assure you the noise will disappear.

                             OOK!
