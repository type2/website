Subject: cot and parts forsale

I have many parts for 68-73 westies and regular buses

I have a cot complete with good canvas ( I have found some one to make the
canvas replacements for the cot but not sure what a good price is?  could
some one let me know.


3/4 front bench seat
grey and white inside door panels and also rear panels
complete light sets front only
2 front wheel mounts
lots of interior stuff for the 68-73 model westies and also 74-76 interior
stuff
lots of other little things that are hard to find

if you are looking for something special  write me an email.


Thanks Paul
