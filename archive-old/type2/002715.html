To Chris and VWBus73T4_at_aol_dot_com,

You WILL NOT flame other listmembers and ESPECIALLY you will not flame other
list members publicly.  Doing so is cause for permanent removal from the
list.

If you want to have an argument with someone, you will keep it civil and you
will keep it off the list.

Before I hear about your right to free speech, consider that the list is
privately owned and privately operated.  Therefore, there is no right to
free speech.  He who pays the bills sets the rules.

One of the things I like most about this list is that 99% of the time all
the discussions and even disagreements are quite civil.  I will not have
this list turning into a flame pit like rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled.

Also as a point of etiquette, it is not good manners to forward someone's
private communication to you back to the list.  If someone wants his/her
communication forwarded to the list, that person can do it.  There is no
need for you to do it for him/her.

Have a nice day,

Sean Bartnik

&gt; Hey, idiot, just because you got burned is no reason to call me a
&gt; ripoff! I don't try to make my mortgage payment from 1 sale,  as I'm not
&gt; really in the business of selling used VW parts. Just because I can get
&gt; better deals than you means 1 of 2 things: I'm in a place that doesn't
&gt; have the obviously higher overhead your location, or that I'm a better
&gt; bargainer than you are! Not a ripoff, just have better person to person
&gt; skills. Folks around here don't put such a high value on 'old Volkswagen
&gt; parts', cause they're just that, old car parts. If you want to debate
&gt; why I can get them cheaper, I suggest you give me a call, as I will be
&gt; posting my newest finds real soon.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I do not know WHAT fantasy world you live in, BUT if you LOOK at what
&gt; &gt; shops
&gt; &gt; charge for cores you can see my price is in line and NOT price gouging
&gt; &gt; as you
&gt; &gt; charge.  And should I JUST give you the block, no better should I pay
&gt; &gt; you to
&gt; &gt; take it because is SO cheap???  I THINK NOT.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   The T4 engines ARE not being made and that drives the cost up, plus
&gt; &gt; it is
&gt; &gt; highly sought after especially for the T1 to T4 conversions.
&gt; &gt; SO do not ask me to sell it cheap JUST because YOU are TOO cheap to
&gt; &gt; pay a
&gt; &gt; fair price.
&gt; &gt; SO do you buy cheap and sell high??? As you continue to rip off the
&gt; &gt; unsuspecting...
&gt;
&gt; I don't want your parts, as I have 3 2.0L cases and assorted parts.
