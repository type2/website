Hi all...

I have been trying for the last month to get oil temp. and head temp. 
guages/senders from my VW FLAPS...finally I have the oil temp. unit, and the 
dipstick should be in on Monday.  However, he sez that the head temp setup will 
be on backorder for at least a month.  As we are going to be driving Edward ('81 
Westy) many hundreds of miles in about a month, and I am paranoid about head 
temperature, I beseech you all.....does anyone have a source?  The VDO part# 
is:310-913.  If there is anyone with knowledge of this kit...Busboys?...please 
let me know....

Thanks,
Gene
