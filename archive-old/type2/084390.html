&gt; Subject: Oil temperature measurement point
&gt;
&gt; Seems as though the best location for the sender is in the main oil
&gt; gallery or in the right rear quadrant of the sump where a dipstick sender
&gt; would live.  The sump plate does not seem to be such a good place for a
&gt; sender.

I think the Gene Berg write-up covered all that.  I believe that where you measure from isn't as critical as one, having an accurate thermometer; two, determining what temperature indicates critical temp at the point in the system where you are measuring; and three, ensuring that your measurement point is valid in all conditions (turns, uphill, downhill, RPM range, etc.).  Gene determined that the dipstick area
satisfied those requirements.

If you are building an new engine one alternative is to drill and tap a hole on the rear of the case opposite of where the hole is where a Type 3 engine dipstick would be.  A Berg Type 3 shorty thermometer can be screwed in there so you don't have to fool with the tangled wire problem that you have with the dipstick variety.
