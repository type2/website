Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line Snafu

It is broke. I explained in an earlier post that this hard plastic hose 
stops about 5&quot; from the front of the engine compartment. It appears the 
P.O. slipped some cloth covered rubber hose over the end then on to the 
high pressure side of the fuel ring. The joint between the plastic and 
rubber hose is leaking. Im trying to find out if this plastic hose is 
supposed to go through the engine tin and connect to the fuel ring, or 
is the joint to the rubber hose before the fuel ring normal.

Is this plastic hose available anywhere?
Should I replace it all the way to the fuel pump with F.I. rated rubber 
hose? If so what size?
Thanks
Tom
