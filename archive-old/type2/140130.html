Subject: Re: [T2] California testing

&gt;&gt; as manufactured. It must be equipped with California 
&gt;&gt;standards
&gt;&gt; equipment. It doesn't have to  VW brand, but the 
&gt;&gt;technology must be as
&gt;&gt; per stock. You will be tested to standards the same as 
&gt;&gt;that year and
&gt;&gt; model equipped with Calif smog equipment and licensed in 
&gt;&gt;California.

Unless I'm missing something, this is not true for 
out-of-state vehicles.  If the car was originally a 
federal model, it conforms to federal standards, not CA 
standards.

I forget where I heard this, though...
