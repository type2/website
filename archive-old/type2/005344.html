Subject: [VB] Parts -- Cape to Cairo


Hey Volks

Our Cape to Cairo by Kombi trip (the Zebra Safari) is coming on nicely, if a
bit slowly (see separate post).

I have completed my collection of spare parts for the trip and, since it's
been a recent topic of list discussion, I've listed it all below.

For those who don't know, the Zebra Safari will be a trans-Africa journey
from South Africa to London, including Cape to Cairo. There are four of us
on the trip, and we intend to take about six months to get to London,
leaving on July 15.

Although there will be places on our route where ACVW parts will be
available, I'm working on the assumption that we are spending six months in
the wilderness with zero support other than occasional roadside fuel
supplies and puncture repairs.

The Zebra Bus had all new brakes (shoes, rubber hoses, s/s cylinder inserts)
and wheel bearings a year ago, and has a newly rebuilt engine and
transmission for this trip, so there is really no reason why it should break
down even once on our epic adventure. But if something does fail, I think
the list below should see us through (not forgetting routine maintenance!)

Spare Parts:

Rebuilt cylinder heads x2
Distributor (complete, assembled) x1
Fuel pump x1
Clutch cables x2
Accelerator cables x2
RGB bearings x1 set
Front wheel bearings x1 set
Alternator bearings x1 set
Alternator brushes x1 set
Spark plugs x12
Points x3
Condensor x3
Distributor cap x1
Rotor x1
Fan belt x4
Sump gasket x5
Tappet cover gasket x10
Engine gasket set x2
Rear axle oil seal kits x2
Set HT cables x1
Exhaust mounting kit x3
Oil cooler x1
Pushrod tubes x4
Brake seals, front, rear master x1 set
Complete clutch incl release bearing x1
Puncture repair kit x1
Electrical cabling, fuses and connectors
Spare light bulbs x1 set
Fuel hose x1m
Headlight glass x2

I'm still looking for a marine-style fuel filter/water trap to replace the
regular inline filter I currently run. I'll carry lots of spare elements if
the system requires.

I am also considering adding to my parts stash a complete tie rod and maybe
even a spare half shaft and RGB gears/stub axle.

We will be carrying five 20l jerry cans on the roofrack, but these will only
be all filled when absolutely necessary, as they will tax the rack and make
the car very top heavy. We are getting four Goodyear 185R14 six-ply
commercial tyres for the bus, and two spares. We will also have an
additional two 185SR14 steelbelt spares just in case on the really bad
sections.

I will be carrying *all* my tools, but I carry them on all road trips
anyway, so that's nothing new. As well as the obvious
spanners/sockets/screwdrivers/pliers/ofallsizesandshapes, my tool kit
includes stuff like small trolley jack, saw, hatchet, folding shovel, tow
chain, wood blocks, breaker bar, tyre levers, hand pump, Hi-lift jack
(modified to fit VW jack point) etc.

All the tools and parts (except the two heads, hi-jack and wood blocks) fit
into four steel ammo boxes of varying sizes that take up surprisingly little
space under the bed inside the bus.

So what does everyone think? Have I left out anything obvious? Is this too
much?
