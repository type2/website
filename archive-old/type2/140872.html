Subject: 68 crew

John here...
just an up date on the 68 crewcab, parts have arrived for the brakes and my
son is hard at work cleaning the back plates up so they can be painted, we
decided that all of the lines should be replaced as well as the other
compontents. While the truck was on the rack we noticed that the front end
needed to be rebuilt as well so those parts are on the way. It seems that just
about everything on this vehicle is going to have to be taken apart cleaned
and/or painted/repaired or replaced.
