&gt;Hey Volks!
&gt;While I'm on a roll I would also like to replace the headliner
&gt;and side panels inside, which are made of a very thin wood panel. Anyplace
&gt;to get those or should I just make'em myself? 

Here's a novel concept- Use the correct materials!

I know, there's people who say that you can do it with that plywood
paneling from the H-D/Lowes-type places...  Don't give in!

To correctly replace your paneling with original materials, call up a
place that supplies specialty woods-  most places have at least one of
these dealers nearby-  and ask for... (drum roll...)

BALTIC BIRCH PLYWOOD!

What you're looking for is 4mm thickness (it comes in metric sheets) and
is great stuff, completely free of voids or checks.  I found it here
locally for around $15-18 per sheet.  And I live in Tennessee.

You will still have to pattern the new panels yourself.  Be careful
removing the old ones, and you're all set.  

Good luck.
