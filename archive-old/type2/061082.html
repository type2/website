Well, I suppose that we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.  My
figures came from actual measurements of tires in the sizes discussed
and your figures apparently came from your similar measurments.

The only thing I can add is that tire dimensions vary between
manufacturers and only have to fall into a range of dimensions to be
called a specific size.  It's possible that you are comparing a
195/75R14 that is on the large end of the range with an 185R14 on the
small end of the range.  OTOH, I could be doing the opposite :)
