Subject: Coil connection mixup

Hello.  On a '76 FI 2000 Calif model w/standard trans and w/air conditioning 
-

What would be the implications if the coil was connected back-a$$ward.  That 
is, the wires that should go to the + were connected to the -, and the wires 
that were connected to the - were connected to the +.

This conditioned only existed for a short while, like 5 minutes of 
unsuccessful cranking, and 5 minutes of idle.

The VW runs now, but verl sluggish, with a max speed on the level of 42 mph. 
  It has not run for the past 15 years, so I am kind of happy to get this 42 
mph (on the level ground).

Thanks
