&gt;You had me saving $300 up to this last sentence. If you can feel the

&gt;bearings and the bearing seats can feel the difference? 

Yes, it does, but then there are all of the people who have put over 100k
on their engines without counterweighted cranks - who knows, maybe those
engines would have gone 300k *with* the counterweighted crank?  Anyway I
really shouldn't be discussing this since I have not actually tried one and
have only second or third-hand experience to offer.  If there is anyone on
the list who has run a counterweighted crank in a type IV for any length of
time, could they please share their experience?

There is some information on counterweighted cranks in the book &quot;How to
HotRod your VW engine&quot; (HP Books, yellow, Wilson form-factor) which is a
very interesting and informative book despite the title.  It includes a
history of the development of the VW engine along with some very
interesting pictures.
