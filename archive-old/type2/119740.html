Subject: AHHHH I fried something-tell me what!

ARRRRRGGGGG! While trying to install an inline blower
for my heater tube in my 71 Westy, I fried something
electrical (insert long colorful line of profannities
here!!!)
Anyway I have no power when I turn the key, NOTHING. I
have no hazard lights, no dash lights, no starting
power.  I pulled out my volt meter and this is what I
discovered:
I DO have 12V where the red\white wire comes into the
fuse box from the starter\battery.  I DO have 12V to
the ignition switch where the red wire goes in from
the fuse block (tested where the wires go into the
back of the ignition switch).  However, when I turn
the key to the &quot;ON&quot; position I have no power on any of
the wires coming out of the ignition switch, I tested
them all. SO powere TO the ignition switch and NO
power coming FROM the ignition switch leads me to
believe that I fried the ignition switch. HOWEVER, I
also have NO hazard lights either, and these should
have power even when the ignition switch is OFF,
right??
So any ideas??? Will a fired ignition switch cause the
hazard lights not to work also??  I am planning on
going to Thanksgiving Misgivings campout next weekdend
and I must get this fixesd!!
