Subject: mirror gasket monkey business

happy frieday - once the grey gasket on the exterior mirrors completely
goes, is that it for these mirrors...or is there a replacement gasket on
the market...? going down high 5 at 70 mph i looked over and saw the glass
shaking. i pulled over, and with a soft poke it literally fell into my hand.
