Subject: RE: [T2] RE: 185/195 Size question

I think the key here is that you use Whatever works for you--I Do know that
when you go to a &quot;Tire Shoppe&quot; or where-ever you buy your tires.-  Always
ask &quot;What is the BEST Deal on a set of tires&quot;! and mention the size you
want--This always works for me.--As a lot of &quot;Tire Shoppes&quot; Do carry, one or
two, sets of 4 tires
that they may have just a few of! Ergo you can cut yourself a deal., TWWM,

&lt;&lt; The thinner contact seems to bite into the slippery surface better and

slush what that same footprint does on very wet roads.....it sort of
hydroplanes. &gt;&gt;

Growing up in MN and later living in NY and MT before moving to OR has
provided_numerous_weather related experiences that support this!!

Though maybe not &quot;cool&quot; narrow is certainly the way to go for traction in
the kind of wet/snowy/muddy conditions that my camper frequently seems to
find its way into. : )
