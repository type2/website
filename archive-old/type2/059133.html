Subject: Nightmare!!  was Oil Pressure Too High

Thanks to all that responded quickly on the relief valves &amp; springs.  My
neighbor took the springs &amp; valves to the parts house this morning and
compared them to the stock springs.  The front spring was almost
identical but the rear spring was almost an inch longer than the stock
one.  He got new ones and while he was at it thought that he would get a
new stock oil pump and replace the high pressure after market one that
was installed.  When I got back from my morning errands (abt noon), he
had replaced the springs and valves had the new oil pump on and was in
the process of putting the pulley and belt back on.

Here begins the nightmare.  As I was lending a hand to tighten the
pulley I noticed that there was not the characteristic give when
tightening it.  I took a wrench to the crank pulley and no movement.  I
quized him on what he had done, all seemed ok except the comment that
the pump just didn't seem to fit right.  Ok, we pulled it out and the
engine turned freely.  We then compared it with the old one and there
was a visible difference in protrusion into the cam area.  Next the old
pump went back in (for now) and we proceeded to fire it up.

NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING.   After double checking, spark, fuel we found
that cyls 3 &amp; 4 were flooded, double checking the carb on that side
found nothing much to be the problem.

Popped the valve cover and to our utter HORROR found that the valves did
not move!!!!  When he tightened the oil pump it snapped the cam right
behind the cam gear.

It turns out later that at the parts house that they asked him did he
need a pump for a dished or flat cam, he answered with &quot;I don't know
give me one for the dished cam&quot;  He later realized that he should have
been a bit more patient, come back home, checked the cam or brought back
the old oil pump for comparisons purpose  (hard to teach 18yr olds
patience, they have to learn it the hard way  (I remember being there)).

While he went back to the parts house to take the pump back, I started
taking off the parts and then we stripped it down and split the cases. 
There it was just as limp as can be, the broken cam.  Well we cleaned up
everything, keeping track of bearings, etc.  Put in a new set of lifters
and cam and cam bearings that he just happened to have.  As of tonight,
its back to the almost long block stage.

ALL THAT AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW IF THE OIL LEAK WILL BE FIXED WHEN
WE'RE DONE!!!

I'm tired, good night!
