&gt;I presume if I calibrate fuel mix with
&gt;EGR online and later take it offline the
&gt;mix will be a little richer than optimum

I don't think that's the case, Bob.  Unless you're messin' with
something other than the idle mixture adjustment, it shouldn't make any
difference, because the EGR valve is closed at idle.
