Subject: Re: [T2] Things I LOVE About Driving a Bus! 

&gt;   Going downhill at 70 when the rest of traffic is going 60,
&gt;   I love passing people.  They get a puzzled (and sometimes
&gt;   annoyed) look like: &quot;Is that VW Bus actually passing me?&quot;
&gt;   It's even better if they maintain their speed and don't
&gt;   speed up so I can't get back into the travel lane...

With the '63 my Dad owned, he'd somewhere come up
with a bumper sticker that said 

  You've just been passed with 39.5 horsepower
