&gt; &gt; Did you see that &quot;Who killed the electric car&quot; film?  There was a
&gt; &gt; supplement in it relating to research and they had an inventor of a

&gt;
&gt; That story rather smacks of the &quot;200MPG carburator&quot; tale that has been
&gt; going around for many decades.
&gt;
&gt; Look at it this way:  Batteries have been used in many devices for over
&gt; 100 years.  The makers of the devices (most of which have never used
&gt; gasoline at any point in their history) would love to have smaller,
&gt; cheaper, and/ or higher-capacity batteries.  Battery technology has
&gt; improved incrementally over time, but is still limited by the chemistries
&gt; available for batteries.  There are a limited number of elements and it is
&gt; unlikely that a new one with a markedly higher electronegativity will be
&gt; found.

no but one thing that is happening is that the materials they make the
batteries from are becoming thinner and stronger so that more battery can
be packed into the same size package as before. no I don't think there is
a magic battery but I do think the usability will become more practical as
time goes by, incremental will eventually be sufficient.

I drew up plans for putting short range battery power into my van. since
more than half my trips are probably less than 25miles I figured I would
be able to use plug in power for the short hauls.  also might help in
acceleration considering electric motors have almost unlimited torque at
zero rpm.  and torque falls off with speed you would maybe be able to get
started faster easier. which would certainly help MPG.
