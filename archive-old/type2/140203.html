Subject: Re: [T2] electric fuel pumps

You are making sure that the electric fuel pumps are for carbs, right? There 
are 2-4 or so psi pumps for carbs, and then there are 35 psi pumps for fuel 
injected engines.   Be sure you don't have one of those. The float needle on 
your carb can handle the lower pressure when in good shape, it may also be 
getting tired.
I don't like electric pumps, I don't trust them. They work for a while and 
then die, as you've seen. For sure I'd carry a spare as you did, good idea.

If your bus is a 1700, it may still have a mechanical pump down there. 
They're hard to change and expensive, but probably more reliable than the 
aftermarket electric cheapos. I do run stock mechanical on my bus.

Did my bus originally have a mechanical pump?  Should
I  go with that?  I don't care as long as the bus runs
as good as it has been.  I can't even talk myself into
changing the ignition system.  Of all the great things
I hear about Petronix and the others, why replace
something that works reliably?  The bopmobile purrs
like a Messerschmitt (sorry to whoever I plagiarized)!


Thanks...KR
