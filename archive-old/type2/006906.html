Subject: Made it home safe and sound - thanks everybody!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey folks, 

Just wanted to let you know that despite my continued transmission trouble, 
even after repairs on the road, my bus &quot;Buster&quot; (1973 VW Camper Bus - 
Hightop) got me home safe and sound on Saturday.

Thanks to all who wrote me and offered a place to stay or on road help if I 
needed it.  It was very much appreciated, and thankfully &quot;Buster&quot; pulled 
through with flying colors and I made it back OK.   He goes back into the 
shop on Monday to get the transmission repaired or replaced!

Thanks again!
