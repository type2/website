Subject: Re: [T2] Shims on generator/fan

It sounds like they are just stored that way. Extras. They're there if you
need them. Convenient.
It's done the same way on the pulley. Jan B

&gt; I would think that having that many shims on the nut
&gt; side doesnt effect the position of the fan in the fan
&gt; housing?
