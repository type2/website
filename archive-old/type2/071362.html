depending on what shade of grey, it can be either water condesation burning 
off or a little bit of oil that has escaped past the rings or valve seals
Water tends to be white/grey and oil tends to be blue/grey
one other thought is it could be running a little rich. Does it only happen 
in the morning when its damp? Run a finger in the tailpipe and see if its 
sooty(rich) or oily(burning a little oil) or is it a nice grey(just fine)
