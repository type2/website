&gt; Volks,
&gt;  
&gt;  I just got my JC Whitney catalog, and amongst the yummies, I spotted a 
&gt;  metrinch tool set. Searched the library and the archives with no real 
hits. 
&gt;  Anyone care to give me a &quot;road test impression&quot; on these?
&gt;  
&gt;  For the price, I expect that I could buy both metric and inch sets, but 
the 
&gt;  savings in weight and space (for the metrinch)is appealing.
&gt;  
&gt;  I would want them to be just as effective as real metric tools, as my 
&gt; teenage 
&gt;  son would pack these as the only set in the bus. Of course, every need 
isn't 
&gt; 
&gt;  covered, so I would make up the missing items for his toolkit.
&gt;  
&gt;  TIA and Cheers/Don Carron
&gt;  
Hi Don,

I cannot comment on the quality of Metrinch tools but I quickly realised when 
I bought my first van 9 years ago that imperial sockets and spanners were a 
waste of space in my toolkit. I removed them, and stashed them in a cupboard 
where they've gathered dust ever since.
 
I've yet to find a single (original) nut on the VW which is not metric, so an 
expensive set of dual purpose tools would end up being a waste of money when 
a cheeper metric only set will suffice.

Good luck
