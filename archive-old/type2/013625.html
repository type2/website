Subject: brake adjusting stars
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Howdy all.

Got a tricky adjusting star, and have tried everything
I can think of, PB Blaster, banging it one way, then
the other, heat, torquing in the adjusting screw to
try and force it out.  My buddy broke the retaining
clips off of his '78 so he could get on them with
vise-grips, but I'd like to avoid that.  Is there some
magical remedy that I'm missing?  BTW, I'm only
heating it with a propane pencil torch.

If anybody's got some great trick, I'd love to know.

Thanks
