Subject: bumpers and Weber 32/36 Progressive carb settup for sale at Everybus!!!

Hello list,

I do not have much to offer at Everybus this year but
I do have a nice set of bumpers that came off my 74
bus and a complete 32/36 Weber Progressive carb.
settup that was for a 2000cc type IV bus.
              THE BUMPERS
As far as the bumpers go, I will watter sand them, fix
any small flaws thatmight be present and respray them
white before I come.The back bumper comes with its
bumper brackets. They really are in good shape. I
don't need them because I am installing the 68-72
style bumpers in my bus. I am droping my asking price
and would like to get $20.00 a piece for them or both
for $35.00. Not a bad price considering a new ones
cost at least $79.00 a piece + shipping + bumper
brackets.Even then they still need to be painted. If
you want them, let me know and I will hold them for
you if you PROMISE to pick them up at Everybus. 
                  
                THE CARB.
I will also have a 32/36 2000cc Type IV Weber
Progressive carb settup at EB02. This settup was on my
1700cc bus when I bought it. The bus was running
alittle rich but strong  and my dad drove it about 25
miles home with no problem. I cleaned and completely
regasketed the carb. This carb will need to be jetted
and tuned to meet the needs of your air cooled VW.
This settup comes with the regasketed 32/36 Weber
carb, intake runners, plenum, and air cleaner and
filter. I am asking $50.00 for the entire settup. 

I also may have a few other items that I may bring.
Just look for the 98 black Madza king cab pick up, (
my bus is getting a make over). I am open to
reasonable offers or possible trade. Please feel free
to email me with any remarks, questions, offers, or
any thing that is on your mind. Thanks

David Kelly
