Subject: addendum to Josh's funeral report

Listees,

I knew I would forget something in my report.  The &quot;other westy&quot; in the
funeral procession was Bill Keating of Stillwater OK.  He was driving his
'82 Westy.  Sorry we didn't get to meet Bill.  Also listee &quot;wannabusser&quot;
David Pierce from Fort Worth TX was there, driving the only Beetle in the
funeral procession.

Hope that's all I missed.

Y'all take care.
