Subject: Re: trouble starting hot engine

&gt; &gt;If your engine runs hot, don't drive it, figure out
&gt; &gt;whats making it hot and fix it.
&gt;
&gt; How do you know if it's running hot if you don't have gauges?  Well, you
&gt; will know when it stops running due to a rod sticking through the case, I
&gt; guess.  :-)

Wellllll,

My dad got a paper towel sucked into his fan on an upright motor.
How WE noticed it was when the engine started missing because
the heads cracked between the valves.  Destroyed both heads,
scored the cylinders, etc, etc.  Oh, this happened about 60 miles
from nowhere in 110 deg F weather.

Total rebuild time. :(
