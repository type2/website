Subject: Re: [T2] TCWBC 2007 Trip Report

&gt;I now declare the Canadian Camping season open.

Greg thanks for the great trip report and pics.  Nice turnout of 
busses.  Looks like the Canadians really know how to put on a winter 
campout!!  At those temps, how long did it take to heat your oil for 
the turkey fry?  I'm kind of surprised those turkey fryers have that 
much BTU to heat at those temps.  Every time I see your trailer I'm 
more impressed than the last time I saw it, good job.
