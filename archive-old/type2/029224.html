&gt;As you know, these steering boxes have a &quot;tight spot&quot; engineered into them
&gt;at the centered position.  If the box isn't adjusted correctly the &quot;tight
&gt;spot&quot; will bind, or in some cases actually cause a &quot;dimple&quot; or low spot in
&gt;one of the gears.  When this happens, no amount of adjusting will solve
the
&gt;problem and the steering gear is basically scrap.
&gt;
&gt;Over the years I've found the majority of steering gear boxes on early bay
&gt;buses are not properly adjusted, and at least half have a dimple that
&gt;renders them beyond repair.

Speaking from experience I ruined my old steering box by taking someones
verbal advice too literally. He said just tighten it up when i complained
about play, and I did without reading the manual carefully. I tightened it
up and didn't back it off a half turn (I think that's the right amount) and
soon developed a loose steering box with big notch in the middle.

Moral of the story: As with many VW things, &quot;more is not always better&quot;.
More tight is not any better then torqing correctly and can often be BAD.
RTFM!!! before you pick up a wrench!!
