Subject: '72 Spindle

Q1 answer...79 spindle will bolt up to the 72 trailing arms...ball joints are
the same, so the holes are the same...difference is the rotor and
caliper...rotor has a different offset, and calliper has a different bolt-up
pattern to the spindle...I wouldn't change one side, but have had good results
changing both sides to the more readily available 73-79 units..

Q2 answer....both of these items (rotor and calliper are 71-72 only, they
changed in 73 onwards)

Best regards for the New Year....

Den.
