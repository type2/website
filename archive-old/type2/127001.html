&gt; My 72 van started loosing power the other night while driving

&gt; It ended up stalling at the stop lights and would not start.
&gt; When cranking it over there was a low backfiring sound.
&gt; I had it towed home, adjusted the valves and it started up.
&gt; Now it will not go over 40 mph and the engine is loud.
&gt; Can anyone help me out will the possible problems.

I'd definately take a look at your points. Look to see if your points
are closing. check the timing.
