Subject: Re: [T2] My day under my bus (long)

As I remember, the 1700 heads also have bigger valves than the 2L heads,
which can help build a &quot;stronger&quot; motor, I believe that the 2L that was
built for me was built along these lines, and it's got more &quot;go&quot; than most
Type IVs around here.

FWIW

&gt; Don,, Don't be surprized to find the 1700 heads on a 2 liter,,
&gt;
&gt; in fact .. Jake says it is a good thing.  I don't have any experience to
say it isn't.

&gt; &gt;  An older head such as a 1.7 &quot;Q&quot; head is a great core for a solid
&gt; &gt; bus engine. They have stronger chambers and resist cracks better than
any
&gt; &gt; other head I have seen. Their chambers work well with a dished 2.0
piston
&gt; &gt; and they simply need boring to the larger 2.0 register to bolt right on.
