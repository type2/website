Subject: Where did the gears go?

Ok...I bled the clutch (83 vanagon)...didn't work.  Slave cylinder was shot, 
replaced that, bled it again...yeah! I have clutch!  But wait! now none of 
the gears seem to be where I left them. Found reverse, 1st, 2nd and 3rd but 
neutral and 4th seem to have vanished. I have aquired a few new grumbles.  
Any suggestions?
