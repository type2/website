Subject: Re: Nose metal needed 68- 71

Rocky Mountain Motor Works stocks a &quot;lower nose panel&quot; that is listed
for 68-72 buses. It is not a complete nose, but is a good starting point
from which to fix the rest of the bus nose, being nice and straight. A
friend of mine ordered said body panel and had a body shop install it on
his '70 Westy. It goes up to about 3 or 4 inches above the front turn
signals, from the very bottom. His body piece was also a bit more curved
at the ends than an actual bus, but it apparently wasn't too big of a
problem to install, per the body shop people.
	They did a fine job with it, and the un-bondoed front end looks much
better now.
