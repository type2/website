Even a small leak could cause the symptoms that you describe. I had a very 
similar backfiring problem to yours on my 75 Kombi, and fixing the exhaust 
leak (by simply replacing a missing bolt in my case) fixed the problem. 

As this is my first post I guess I should do something of an introduction. 
I live in Canberra in Australia, and I have a 75 kombi with a SOPRU poptop, 
1800 engine (not fuel injected). I am in the long process of fitting it out as 
a camper (as the PO had completely gutted the interior - because he didn't 
like it), and dealing with the many other little problems that arise with it 
from time to time :-}. It is my only transport, and contrary to what many 
people think find it very reliable (well I have only had to have it towed 
once, in 3 years). I originally bought it to fix up and go on a round 
Australia trip, but it never happened :-( , so now it is my daily transport, 
as well as taking me to lots of weekend trips to the snow and the coast 
(depending on the season.)

And now to my squeak. This one is really puzzling me! It is a high pitched 
squeak that seems to be the worst in the mornings when I first start driving 
(it gets down to -6 degrees celsius where I live). It only appears when the 
car is moving, and it doesn't matter whether or not the engine is running. The 
thing that gets me is that it is not a regular squeak - it comes and goes. Oh 
and putting the brakes on lightly doesn't seem to affect the nature of the 
squeak at all.
I had thought it might be brakes so I have pulled the rear drums off, and 
cleaned all the dust out. There was plenty of pad left, and while the drums 
were a bit scored they looked OK to me. I also wondered if the handbrake line 
was freezing up and causing the problem, but I don't really know.

If any one has any ideas, or things I could check, I would be grateful.

Thanks
