Subject: Re: [T2] cam gear numbers - anyone?!

&gt;Does nobody know about cam gear numbers? I know many of you have put
&gt;new cams in your engines. 

Hi Mike,
When I had ordered a reground cam from Boston Bob he had me look over
my cam gear for the number but I was unable to locate it.  So he just
had me ship it to him (regrounds were on an exchange basis any ways)
and he'd locate a correct replacement. So a week goes and I get a call.
He had been unable locate the backlash number but used some tool or
something to figure out the backlash was. This was over 3 years ago so
the details are a little sketchy. So although the backlash is supposed
to be marked on the cam gear sometimes its not. I read somewhere in a
VW engine rebuild book that the number was marked in ink, maybe it just
wears out with age? I'd have figured it be stamped on..

Maybe webcam inspected your old cam and sent you one with a matching
number and just did not mention it to you. There is also some kind
of test you can do to check backlash. I think its in the Bentley and
i know for a fact it's in the Wilson VW Rebuild guide.
