&lt;&lt; I'd appreciate opinions on the best way to do this. I've heard that Waxoyl
is very good but then I've also heard that Agway or Husquarvarna bar oil
works well.  How about a US source for Waxoyl. The only one I've found on
the web is the Swiss headquarters and they don't list US distributors.
Thanks in advance,

Domestic wax/oil (not WaxOyl):

One lb. candle wax
1/2 gal. mineral spirits/turps
Mineral oil (from the drug store)

Cheese grate the wax into the mineral spirits, stirring, stirring.
Cover and keep in a warm (not hot - flammable mixture !) place.
Stir regularly until the wax is thoroughly dissolved into the min-
eral spirits.
Thin with Mineral oil to usable consistency (brush or garden sprayer)

Yes it &quot;does&quot; work as a rust &quot;preventative&quot;, but when summer returns
you will find the bus weeping the mixture if it gets really hot...

YMMV, of course...
