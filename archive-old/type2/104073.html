Subject: Re: [T2] My bus is tired

----- Original Message -----
 '78 Bus is just &quot;too old&quot; to be my daily driver.

Bull#$%*, don't listen to em, my daily driver is a '79 with 110K on the
original engine and it's just as reliable, if not more than some new cars.
Drive easy ( I NEVER go more than 60mph ) and regular tune-up/maintenance
and I don't have any problems. DON'T GIVE UP!!!
