In regards to the tank, you're best bet is probably to pick up a FI tank
somehow, unless you trust yourself to weld a return line.  I started
with a 78 bus, so yes, it was already FI.  All I had to do was cut an
old harness and hook it up to the MS relay board.

I haven't figured exactly how I'm going to deal with the coolant temp
issue.  I've been testing some various ideas, but I'm not particularly
content yet.  One person just used a gm sensor and put it in the cooling
air path and he says that works well.  Another person just adjusted the
resistance values on the board to bring his stock CHT within range...

 &gt;&gt; Hi Mike,
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;  I already thought of a stock FI-system, but our buses never came 
with FI in
 &gt;&gt; Germany (only dual solex). Naturally you can't get a catalytic
 &gt;&gt; converter-setup(spelled right?) for the bus. The only FI-system that 
bolts
