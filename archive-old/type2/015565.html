&gt;When I asked Boston Bob what kind of oil pressure he
&gt;would guarantee on a T4 rebuild, he sounded like a
&gt;politician.  Near as I could tell he couln't guarantee
&gt;anything.  How did Boston Bob get such a good rep?

A whole bunch of people, some with good skill and knowledge, have testified
on this forum and others to a quality product from good procedures. The
valve adjustment procedures for the Wasserboxers are being updated by
VW/Bentley based upon his research and testing. Are you aware how rare it
is for any major automotive manufacturer to revise a basic procedure of
nearly 20 years standing?? And a German manufacturer at that. They would
not have considered doing so unless he presented his data and information
in a PROFESSIONAL manor in the lingo of Neandereers (Engineers descendand
from Apes with BigBonedBrowRidges).

Boston Bob is recognized as expert in motor building because he gets good
results, day in and day out. He is one of a handful of VW builders that can
be trusted to give spec or better products reducing the chance of failure
to the lowest possible probability. 

In my opinion, you can be reassured that the oil pressure your engine comes
with will meet or beat VW specifications if Boston Bob or NW ConRod build
it. Read the warrenty to see what is covered.

If, however, you think you have need of a higher than spec oil pressure
guarantee then I suggest you check with Bergs. They do custom VW motor
design of the highest level and have more inhouse research than anyone
except the factory.
