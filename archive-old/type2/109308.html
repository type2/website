Subject: Re: [T2] 69 DC project

Hi Ben. Welcome! I havn't been here very long but have learned alot from
this list in that time.

When you say &quot;frame&quot; what exactly do you mean? The bus doesnt really have a
frame. It's basically a unibody construction with the frame rails and body
being one which the axles,tranny and so forth bolt on to.  There are support
beams that can be replaced by cutting and rewelding. The rockers and doglegs
and such can be replaced without to much pain by a knowledgable body person.
Most online vendors carry replacement pannels for not alot of money but be
aware that alot of the aftermarket stuff doesn't fit perfectly and may need
some tweaking. Body work is not cheap to do right. How far gone is this DC?

&gt;
&gt;     My question(s) for y'all is this:  Do any parts stores (Bus Boys, Bus
&gt; Depot etc.) sell a complete frame (in one piece), or is my only route to
buy
&gt; all the pieces? I have only seen individual pieces on on-line catalogues.
I
&gt; do not wish to gut a donor bus for a frame. OR, is it better for my own
&gt; sanity to say good-bye to the happless 69, walk away and look elsewhere
for
&gt; a project?
&gt;
&gt;     Ben
