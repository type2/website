Thanks for all the advice on getting the #2 plug out.  I ended up buying the 
magnet on a stick thing, and it wasn't much of a problem.  The best advice I 
got for putting the #2 plug in was to stick the plug in a piece of rubber 
hose about a foot long, I used fuel line, then you can the plug right into 
it's hole and give it a few turns to set it, then put your socket in.  Worked 
perfectly.  Thanks again for all the help.
