Subject: Bearings

I have torn the engine down in my 70 bus to find the case cut to 0.60
and the thrust
to 0.80. the crank is 0.20/0.20. There is a very slight catch on the
case when you run your fingernail across the bearing surface. My
question what is the longevity of  engines rebuilt with cases cut to
0.80 and 0.80 thrust? I have located bearings for  $46.00. Am I wasting
money on line boring to 0.80 and bearings? All responses from folks who
have been there and done this would be appreciated. I purchased this bus
not running and based upon its previous owner it was overheating and
knocking. the bearings were worn to indicate it was starting to beat out
the case.

Thanks,
Steve
