Subject: Extremely HIGH oil pressure

Volks- First of all, thanks to all who responded to my posting about my
draining battery I think I figured out what was the problem. As you can
see from the title of my post, I have a new problem- very high oil
pressure. I recently added a filter and external oil cooler to my bus,
taking the oil from the old filter screw-on point  (I have a '74 westy
with an 1800 engine).  I wrote to the list a week or so ago, complaining
about a leak from somewhere I couldn't see, on the driver's side of my
engine. It was a fairly constant drip drip drip drip.  I was worried
about my oil pressure, but it was fine, the idiot light went out right
after I started the bus. So today I installed an oil pressure gauge in
the dash and added the oil pressure sender from The Real Source (by the
way to those of you who want to add this pressure sender, you have to
make the hole bigger in the tin). I JUST started up the bus and the oil
pressure SHOT up past 80psi (the highest it reads) and buried itself  as
far as it could to the right. I checked my wiring and tried started the
bus again. Again, my oil pressure SHOT up like a rocket. I turned the
engine off and watched as the needle slowly moved back over to the left
and stopped at zero. It *seemed* like the gauge was reading the pressure
dropping properly, but I don't know.  Could the gauge be inaccurate? 
On top of this, I came out this morning to find a large puddle of oil
under my bus. It looks like it leaked from the same place the drip drip
drip drip came from, but I'm not sure.  I'm wondering if the high oil
pressure has caused something to leak, and if my external cooler, filter
and hoses are causing my high oil pressure. Could this be true?
Oh yeah, I'm going to check my pressure relief valve and pressure control
spring, but if these aren't the case, what could it be? 
Thanks for your help
