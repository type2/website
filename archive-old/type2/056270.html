&gt;im gonna be taking out my pancake motor for work soon. i think its
mostly original 
&gt;tin with heater boxes etc. down here in florida we dont need all this.
can i take it all 
&gt;off. if i tore all the exhaust stuff off what would i get to put back.
i know lots about type 

Ok, I'll bite...  Why do you want to get rid of original tin and heater
boxes?  

The tin is there to keep the cooling air flowing properly and the
heaterboxes aren't hurting anyone.  I mean, let's face it, an extra 30
lbs on a 3000 lb vehicle isn't really going to make any difference in
economy or power.

Pull the engine.  Do your rebuild.  Clean all the tin up real nice and
bolt it all back on where it goes.  Longer engine life, better resale
value, better karma.
