To further muddy the waters, Bentley claims that the &quot;Remote Control Lock&quot;
was the same for 1968 through 1970 models, then a new/different mechanism
was used &quot;1971 and later&quot;.  The handles illustrated also appear to be
different for each type of mechanism.  See Bentley, section 1, page 21.

&gt;&gt;  Mike's photo looks like the rear &quot;silent&quot; closing handle. Or is the
photo
flopped? But what's all that stuff sticking out the back of the door? I
seem to remember the 69 cross-bar mechanism I pulled for Brian's 71 had two
big ends on it. I need to check my bus and see if it's got shanks for two
handles.  &lt;&lt;
