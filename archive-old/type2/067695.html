Subject: Re: Chirping noise from distributor?

I had this problem with an old super beetle I had.  I fixed it by dropping
some oil down the center of the distributor shaft.  Remove the rotor and
look down the shaft.  There usually is a felt wick at the bottom.  If this
is kept oiled, the squeak should go away
