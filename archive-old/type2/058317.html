Subject: Coupling Disc Part num 68 thru 74

Hi All,

Found a part number, and vw still has them, 22.50
each (arghh), part number 211-415-417.

Earliar this week I wrote &quot;where the steering
column connects to the steering box, there is a
rubber ^Ócoupling disc^Ô there and you should be
able to get a few fingers on it, to push and prod
it for cracks.&quot;.  Bruce Maxson says you can get at
it from the inside to inspect by just removing two
screws at the base of your steering column (thanks
Bruce).

dave.  &quot;may your coupling disc always remain
intact&quot;.
