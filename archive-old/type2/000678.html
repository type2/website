Subject: Have I got a piece of missing tinware

Dear List,

this is quite a difficult one to describe.

I have a 2litre dual carb engine in my 79 bay camper, and I think I may have
a piece of missing tinware and cannot find a good illustration of typeIV
tinware in Haynes etc.

The piece in question is on the bottom of the engine on the left hand side
(cylinders 3+4, the side without the thermostat bellows).   I have the flat
piece that bolts between the bottom of the sump and the heatexchanger and I
have a piece that this screws to  with two screws that directs the cold air
&gt;from the top side of the engine past the exhaust from cylinder 3.  The
problem I have is that there appears  to be a gap between this top piece of
tinware and the rocker cover, through which air escapes.  The other side of
the engine has different tinware with no hole as the petrol pump is there.

Have I described this well?  Am I missing some tinware.  Does anyone know
where I can get a clear, full diagram of the underside tinware.

Any suggestion etc would be appreciated.
