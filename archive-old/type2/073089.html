&gt;hope this one is an easy one for you experts out there. When I got my 70
&gt;westy, all the roof paneling was painted white. Is this correct

It is not correct. The roof paneling is supposed to be covered with orange
shag carpeting, fastened with Liquid Nails adhesive and a staple gun.
Obviously your bus has been hacked. 8)

It's really supposed to be Baltic Birch ply. Any hardwood ply would do. If
you measure it you will find that in order to replace it you need the
European 5' x 5' size rather than the American 4' x 8', otherwise the book
matching runs the wrong way. If you have a &quot;Woodworker's Supply&quot; type
vendor in the nearest large city they can get it for you. There's lots
about this in the archives.
