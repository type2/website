&gt; labratory
&gt; section in the idiots book :) I hadn't thought to bring
&gt; in the extra
&gt; variable of non-detergent oils. The original question was
&gt; simply a
&gt; brand change &amp; a quick skim through Muir doesn't say
&gt; anything about
&gt; changing brand, just don't follow an engine that has been
&gt; running
&gt; non-detergent oil w/ detergent oil
won't even go into that....as you don't really need to brak
in with non D anymore these days apparently??

...but anyway, I'm hoping I don't offend anyone here BUT!!!


Muir was not  GOD!! He wrote a lot of wonderfull info on
volkswagons, ........the idiots guide was my first manual
twenty years ago, but....he didn't know everything
