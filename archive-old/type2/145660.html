Subject: [T2]steering box knock?

past two days now i been hearing a knock when i turn the wheel back and forth gently...
  so this morning i started to leave out to run to store real quick and heard it again when i just barely go to turn wheel i hear a knock and if i turn the wheel back to left i hear the knock again like its hitting something in one certain spot....?
   
  so this morning my daughter turned the wheel as i lay under the bus and it sounded like it was coming from right theree at the steering box...? she turned wheel back and forth till it caught and started to turn wheels and went back other way each time right before it actually turned the wheels is when you hear the knock coming form around the steeering box section...?
   
  does this mean that now after all this with the new ball joints my steering box is going out...
  are these the signs of a failing steering box...? or maybe something else&gt;?
   
   
  thanks
  chai
