&gt; just a nice preventative maintnance idea for the summer.. any input and past

Air scoops will do nothing for a properly maintained bus.  They _may_
lower temperatures in a bus with missing engine bay seals or other air
leaks into the engine bay.

Make sure your engine bay seals and tin are present and correct.  This
will yield much better results than a tack-on!
