&gt; Hi renoir here,
&gt;  
&gt;  I overtightened my belt and fried the bearing.
&gt;  I seem to remember reading about that here once before, boo hoo.
&gt;  
&gt;  Thinking, motor out.
&gt;  Can I pull that out straight through the back, without pulling off the
&gt;  doghouse?
&gt;  Change the bearing or put in another generator, and slide it back in.
&gt;  I thought I had read this somewhere.
&gt;  
get yr 36mm nut on the big nut on the front side of the gen- around the fan.  
hold the gen from turning with screwdriver as usal, and undo that 36mm nut.   
then undo the gen strap and fan belt.  carefull of the shims when you remove 
the gen.  There are shims between fan and gen as well as between nut and fan.

I have succesffully pulled of the gen with fan in an upright motor installed 
in the bus (no thermostat) but in a DH w/thermo it is trickier- the above 
technique helps.

But you could also pull the motor- 

there are many ways to get there.
