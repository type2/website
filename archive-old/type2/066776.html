Morning, everybody.

&lt;pours cup of coffee&gt; Long night last night, dancing to Brave Combo at
Lincoln Center. Finally got to know my upstairs neighbor who is moving
out next week. Sad how you only meet people sometimes right before they
disappear... Anyways, on to the VW content:

Me, my girfriend Deb, said upstairs neighbor, Terri, and a friend drove
into the city in our '71 Westy. Terri is looking for wheels when she
gets to Texas. And she loved our Westy. You have to be pretty into the
design to love it, 'cause it's rusty and ugly, so I think she's serious.
SO...

Anyone know of anything in the Austin area? She's shopping in the cheap
but not so cheap it's a wreck sector of the market. For her purposes, I
think a Kombi would be just great. I know there's a lot of gorgeous
buses down there (spent a summer there doing &quot;research&quot; on conjunto
music), and I'm sure there's one that would do the trick for her. She's
moving next week, so the sale could be made pretty quickly.

Well, back to my coffee. Have a good day, all.
