Subject: Re: [T2] Tires

Good info, but a minor correction:  The Michelin Agilis61 is not a highway
rib tire, but rather an all-season tire which is one reason why I selected
it over some of the other choices you mention.  Yes, it is super pricey :-)

I think there are some models of the Agilis that are more of a highway rib
design but the Agilis61 in 185R14 is not.  Those retail for right around
$100 each.

&gt; slightly taller.  Tires in 185R14 and 195R14 tend
&gt; to be commercial highway rib style with
&gt; appropriate (C or D load-rating).  Choices in
&gt; these tires include the super-pricey Michelin
&gt; Agilis, Yokohoma 356's (?), Cooper SRM (and twin
&gt; Mastercraft Courser RD), Bridgestone RD603, and
&gt; I think Kumho is still importing some.
