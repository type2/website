Subject: Re: [T2] having a nice looking extendable thermostat is not
  all, right ?

You need to think about how hot it is up there right now. You may not
get a strong pull on the cable until colder weather comes.

 Excuse my French John !  ;-)  I was not very explicit. My problem is that
 despite the fact the my thermostat looks very nice and expand very well
 when hot in boiling water. Once installed in the engine, It is not strong
 enough to pull the flaps shut while cooling , the flaps string (which
 maintain the flaps open) is too strong compare to the capacity of the
 thermostat to pull the flaps shut. So my question is : Do I need to
 change my thermostat ?
