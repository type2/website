&gt; I was thinking, my fuel pump was &quot;repaired&quot; not replaced, think this may have
&gt; attributed to my power loss on the hill, as well as some jumpy

&gt; or eletric, or whatever, any ideas?
Shawn:
A defective fuel pump might cause loss of power on hills, but it seems
like symptoms would show up during full throttle cruising as well. The
push rods on the 72-74 type 4 fuel pumps sometimes wear out causing
inadequate fuel delivery, too. I'd stick with a stock pump because it's
low tech and safe,(though rather expensive), but first replace your fuel
filter, and try to replicate the same symptoms when the gas tank is
completely full. If it does this with a full tank, I doubt it's a fuel
delivery problem.
