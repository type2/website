Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pressure reg test as separate component?

Mark

Locally we have a desiel fuel truck repair place that cleans and balances
injectors... and of course he is selling his service,, he told me that he rarely
sees a set of injectors that are balanced,, even if they are clean.

I have had  a few used injectors cleaned and balanced just so I know where I am
starting from.
But he recommends balancing new ones too....

I would search your area for a service that provides this,,,

Hope that helps
