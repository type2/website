    Greetings List!  First of all I would like to thank everyone on the lis 
for their help in the teardown of my t4.  Now that everything is in pieces, 
however, it appears more work needs to be done than I have the time or money 
for right now.  So I've begun to look at rebuilt engines for sale.  I have 
looked into GEX and AVP so far.  Does anyone have experience with these 
companies? I would also like to get in touch with Strictly Foreign and SIR.  
Does anyone know how I could contact them?  Does anyone know any other good 
places to try?  Any comments or suggestions would be great.  Thanks for 
everything, Pete.
