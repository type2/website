Hi all,

	I finally had some time to work on my 70 Westy last night. I had
received a rejection sticker from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and had
a few things left on my list to fix before I went in for another inspection.
The last thing was to fix my right hi-beam. I installed a new light: No high
beam. The fuse checked out OK. Must be a wiring problem thinks I. I start to
go through the wiring. The P.O. had left the fuse box dangling under the
dash, and I have not fixed this yet. I trace the wiring from the headlight
to the fuse box, no opens or shorts. Wait a minute, that does not look like
it goes to fuse # 8. Hey, guess what, the fuse *is* blown. The Bentley
manual lists the wrong fuses in the fuse list, but the wiring diagram looks
O.K. if you realize the picture in the diagram is looking at the back of the
fuse box. Anybody else find this problem with the Bentley? O.K. thinks I, I
can now get a good sticker, but while I am under there and have the tools
out, I decide to do a little more work. I clean up and get rid of a bunch of
wiring the P.O. had installed that goes no where now. I reconnect the wire
from my rear interior light switch to the fuse block and that works again,
and try putting the fuse box back into its holder. Hmmm....this thing is so
close to the front sheet metal, I decide to wait until I can disconnect the
battery before I short the whole thing out trying to put it back in the
holder. O.K., time to start her up and go blind other drivers with my
functional high beams, as it is getting dark. She turns over fine, but does
not start, not even a cough. This bus always starts (except for the time one
of the wires came off the starter solenoid, she wouldn't crank then, and I
had to remove one of the heater bellows to see the problem). I still have
the VOM out so I turn the key to the on position and check the voltage
across the coil, nutin, nilch, 0 volts. I go back to the wiring diagram and
check out the fuse block. It looks like the path goes form the battery to
the ignition switch to the fuse block and unfused (on the same fuse block
side as where the wire from the ignition switch comes) goes to the coil. NO
WIRE THERE GOING TO THE COIL. WHERE DID IT GO????? Start looking around but
it is really getting dark now and I give up for the night. The oil and gen
lights come on and the starter cranks so the key switch must be O.K., right?
Am I correct with my understanding of the path to the coil? Where should I
look for the missing wire? Where does it enter the under dash area from?
Drive your VW to work day is this Friday and I also plan on attending the
New Hampshire VW show this Sunday. Can I just run a wire from the battery to
the coil for now until I get this fixed? I know I have to disconnect this
when I shut the bus off or I can fry my coil and points. By the way, any
south of New Hampshire listees plan on carabussing to the show Sunday
morning?

	Any help or morale support you can provide is, as always, greatly
appreciated.

Jeff
