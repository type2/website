&gt;I just spent about a 2 weeks cleaning them
&gt;with oven cleaner. It was a dirty and tedious
&gt;job but was effective. My valves were in great
&gt;shape and even better as I removed all the
&gt;carbon between the valve and the seat.

They may have looked great but I don't believe their looks is an accurate
way to determine what condition they are in.  The books say to replace them
every time with good quality new valves.  After having one break on me and
ruin every major component of my engine, I will spend the money for new TRW
valves every time and recommend that others do the same.

&gt;As I understand the 1.8 l has bigger valves than
&gt;the 2.0
&gt;If I were you I'd rebuild a 2.0 with those 1.8
&gt;heads and
&gt;get better flow.

Don't assume that you will get better flow by simply having bigger valves.
The ports in the head are only 33mm.  Also the bigger vavles will increase
the amount of shrouding inside the combustion chamber which is a barrier to
flow.

I got a 7% increase in rear wheel horsepower on my bus by going from the
1.8 heads to the 1.7 heads (smaller valves).  Okay, I also bumped the
compression up a little (from 7.2 to 7.5) but still, I don't think anything
was lost by having the smaller valves.  As any experienced hotrodder will
tell you, it's all about having a well-matched system.
