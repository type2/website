Despite the metal I found in my oil strainer last week,
I decided to roll the dice and took my '79 Westy camping
last weekend. On Friday morning, my friends in their Ford
Explorer, Toyota 4-runner, and my wife in our Isuzu Trooper
headed for Anza-Borrego State Park in So Cal. I had to be
in Yuma, AZ for work on Saturday night, so we took two cars
so that she could camp an extra night before joining me in
Yuma.

We turned off the pavement and started up the Pinyon
Mountain 4-wd road. The first 5-6 miles are a gradual
ascent 1-2 Kft in loose sand, the kind you don't want to
stop in because you will spin your tires and sink in when
you try to get going again. The bus got increasingly warmer
as I headed up hill. As the temperature (oil sump plate)
topped 250, I decided to pull over and let it cool off. I
walked around the corner and saw a rocky stretch of
road with a big boulder to get over. With a little guidance
from my friends, I was able to climb the boulder and make
it through another rocky spot. Another mile of loose sand,
and deeeep ruts, and we found an excellent camping
spot. Everyone was impressed that the bus made it,
especially since they were all in 4wd. I did have to rock
the bus back and forth a few times, and required one
push to get going over one spot. I don't think I would
bring the bus up there again. It did fine in the sand, and
on the rutted road, but clearance over rocks and boulders
was an issue.

At night, it rained and looked bad the next day, so we
decided to get back down the road before it turned to
mud. It was harder for the bus to get down over the big
boulder than up it, mainly because the boulder had to
pass under the right wheels on the way down. I had to
line up twice before attempting to cross the boulder, and
the propane tank was a problem. I ended up using the
propane tank's metal plate as a skid plate over the boulder.

Because of the rain, my wife decided to go to Yuma with
me for a few days and stay in a hotel. We returned home
in the bus and concluded an 800 mile trip with no bus
problems. However, I am still very nervous about the
metal in my oil. This weekend, I will dump the oil again and
see if there are any more flakes.
