Subject: Sludge in gas tank

Just bought some now transportation so I can lay my buses up for winter
maintenance. I seems to run great when fed fuel from a gas can but can't get a
drop of fuel out of the tank! Pulled the hose off the spigot on the bottom of
the tank and it was dry. :~( Looking in the tank it looks as though the tank
was full when it was parked years ago and all the gas evaporated. Lots of
sludge. I sprayed some carb cleaner at the little area I could see and the
sludge loosened and moved revealing clean metal.

What is the best low cost solvent for dissolving this sludge? Carb cleaner
would be rather expensive to fill the tank with. The tank was filled with gas
about a week ago by the P.O. This didn't seem to loosen the sludge much.
Should I just fill it back up an be patient or is there something better than
gas for this?
