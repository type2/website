&gt; &gt; I would try some windshield washer Anti-freeze with de-icer.I feel
&gt; this would not tant the tank as much as regualar anti-freeze. Tell me
&gt; what you think though. Thanks Happy Hoildays

      Good Grief! Are you stone nuts?  If you really need an immediate, easy
to obtain, freeze-proofing for a drinking water tank, use vodka or gin.
Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances would you use anti-freeze (other
than the RV type made for such uses), de-icer, rubbing alchohol, or anything
else that you wouldn't normally drink.  Windsheild washer? Good way to get
some brain damage, i guess, if it didn't kill you.
