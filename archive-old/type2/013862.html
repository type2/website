Subject: more manifold problems

I got all pipes filed true, but have encountered a
stripped stud.  I seem to recall a mechanic telling me
about this a couple of years ago.  Said I have to
remove the engine to retap the hole.  It threads, but
slips at the end when I apply moderate torque.  Does
lock-tite work in a situation like this?  

Thanks for the help!
