&gt;I can see worrying about the bolts, but they screw into the flywheel (one of
&gt;the hardest pieces of metal in the whole car) so the female threads aren't
&gt;such a worry.

If you overtighten these bolts the usual result is the bolt head snaps off
flush with the plate. Then you have to remove the plate and get the broken
bolt out of the flywheel, and that usually means drilling.

Also, when tightening the presure plate, use the cross-hatch method; tighten
one,
then tighten the one opposite that one, then tighten the one to the left of the
first one, then the one opposite that one, then the one to the right of the
first
one, then the opposite. Snug them up this way, and also apply final torque this
way.
