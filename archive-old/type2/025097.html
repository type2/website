Subject: need help NOW, gas tank screen
Message-ID: &lt;9deeced4.243e0ada_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hey,

I've already inhaled and absorbed more gas into my skin than any animate 
object probably can, I have probably taken a good 10 years of my 
life.....ANYWAY, I drained the gas, took off the nut thing (i have a 1972 
Westy with 1700 pancake engine) off the gas tank outlet, but I can't get the 
damn thingy with the little tube sticking out, I'm assuming the screen is 
attached to this, removed, I yanked on it, WD-40ed it, tried some more, it 
won't come out, tried prying it....bla bla bla.........I can't get that 
stupid thing to come out, is there something I forgot to do, or is it just 
stuck.  Please respond as soon as you can I was supposed to be at school an 
hour ago.

Thanks!
Shawn
