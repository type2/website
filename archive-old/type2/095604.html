Subject: RE: [T2] Have I sinned?

&gt; I did something yesterday that I hope won't get me banned from
&gt; the Bus list...I bought a 2002 Beetle. New. Five Speed, with
&gt; manual windows!
&gt; My very first car was a 1968 White Beatle...a Semi-Automatic...


No, you won't get banned for buying a New Bug.
But we might kick you out for misspelling &quot;Beatle.&quot;  :-)

p.s.  My wife drives a '99 Beetle and loves it! 60k miles so far and it's
never needed anything but a battery and tires.
