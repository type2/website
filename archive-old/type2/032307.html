hi everyone

I drove my bus for the first time tonite, from my vw mechanic's shop
home... about 5 miles. I was excited and nervous at the same time to
finally be able to drive her. All went well. For a bus that sat for 4
years with no engine, she rode extreamly smooth. I guess this would be her
first trip report :)

I posted the otherday about my vw guy telling me that the engine was only
running on 2 cylinders. When I went to his shop this morning he showed me
what exactly he was talking about. He took some starting fluid and sprayed
it on different parts of the engine. When he sprayed it on the left side
intake runner it reved up really nice then died back to a slower idle a
few seconds later. When he sprayed it to where intake runners connect to
the central air induction unit it did the same. Spraying to the right side
intake runners did nothing. So, I guess this would mean there is a leak on
the left side #3 and #4. When he pulled the plug wires on those cylinders
there was no change in the idle. So sure enough shes only running on 2
cyls....

When I put the engine in i replaced the old intake runners with ones off a
porsche 914. the old ones were rusted pretty bad. My vw guy said that
sometimes they warp, letting air get it and do exactly this. I put on new
manifold to head gaskets on and new runner boots as well. He said it could
also be the injector seals. He gave me a new set to put on as well as a
new intake runner for that side. He woudl have done it, but I had just
paid $625 for an entire brake job so,being a bit short on $$ I'll have to
deal with this one on my own ;)

My questions: 
this is my intended plan of attack. I'm gonna clean up that new intake
runner, get it good and clean/smooth as well as the mating face on the
head. install the new intake runner (should I use any sealant? didn't
before and the job failed....) I also plan to clamp the boots on. I figure
it couldn't hurt any. 

A question:
when he did the brakes he said he couldn't get the brake pedal from
dropping with the speed of the engine. When you rev it faster, the pedal
falls with the engine speed. He said it was probably the same leak
problem. He tried 4 booster valves and the all did the same thing. He put
it on backwards to override the power assist for the time being. Just so I
could get it home :) 
Could it be related, or is that something else... like the servo?

Comment:
I can't beleive this thing is only running on 2 cyls.. I mean, i saw with
my own eyes that when he pulled the wires it had no effect, and this is
bad. BUT I GOT THE THING UP TO 40MPH ON THE WAY HOME THAT WAY!!! is that
possible? It was weak... but I would not expect a 4 cyl engine to run that
good on only 2 cyls. Maybe it just does. That would also be a good
explination as to why it smells so bad.

Could a false or incorrect vaccum line connection cause any of the above
symptoms? If anyone has any advise or corrections to what I have stated it
would be very much appreciated..

thank you all so very much for reading
