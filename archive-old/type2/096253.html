Subject: Re: [T2] Removing the side cover necessary to replace side window?

&gt; I'm outside looking at the rear drivers side window that some idiot smashed

&gt; it appears to be pretty much arc-welded on there, I got one screw out, need
&gt; to remove the other, then what???

don't think you need to remove it, but if you decide to it is removed
exactly the same as the side with the door.  (made it easier to build
right hand drives that way no new body panels)  just tap it up with a
board and rubber mallet working your way along the bottom edge
