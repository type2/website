&gt;CHT will shoot up initially though, so I always try to keep the revs up
&gt;immediately after I exit the freeway, to cool the heads down a little.  
&gt; &gt;One of the scarier things I've seen is driving with a hot engine on the 
&gt; &gt;freeway then immediately pulling over and stopping, say at a rest &gt;stop.  
&gt;If you suddently remove the cooling air,
&gt;the heat will build up quickly.  I can't see this being good for the 
&gt; &gt;engine.

I wish this whole thread ran a week ago.  I just put about 800 miles on my 
new-to-me '78 Transporter (2.0l FI) this past weekend... driving 5+ hours 
two days in a row in gorgeous summer heat on the highways of southern 
Ontario... with my two boys in the back we stopped at several small towns 
for fresh fruit, bathroom breaks, a visit to a train museum, etc. etc.  We 
ran 91 Octane premium gasoline in an engine rebuilt by Volkswagen Canada 
only 12,000 miles ago...

2 days after the trip we dropped the seat valve on cylinder #4.  Now I'll be 
spending this coming weekend replacing the cylinder head.  Well, not only me 
since I'm still a green newbie...

Why'd the valve seat drop?  Too much octane from the gas?  Frequent rest 
stops on a hot summer day?  Pushing the engine to 70 mph for the last hour 
of the trip cuz the kids were raising a ruckus in the rear seats and the 
traffic was quickening as we enterred the city?  I dunno.  Maybe all these 
reasons or maybe just bad luck.
