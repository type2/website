&gt; Here's a question that's been bugging me for quite some time.  I almost

&gt; 1) When changing plugs, I've alway been told it is best to do it on a
&gt;    COLD ENGINE to reduce the risk of stripping the head.

&gt; 2) When checking cylinder compression, I'm always been told to do it on
&gt; a WARM ENGINE.

&gt; And, *yes*, I do use anti-sieze religiously on the spark plug threads...


Well, Grasshopper....
Inherent in the question is its answer.

Or if you are Jewish:

Rabbi Yishmael says. &quot;Two passage that contradict each other - until a
third passage comes to reconcile them&quot;. (Intro to Sifra) 

Y'know, if anyone had ever told me I would be able to quote Talmud on this
list, I would have called them a liar! :-)

In short, If you don't use anti-sieze, you risk stripping your heads
performing a necessary diagnostic - and don't sue the mechanic if you are
the one who installed the plugs w/o anti-sieze
