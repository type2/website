Wha? Winter?  Well son you must have some kind of winter I ain't never heard of.
I took that sort of southerner advice back in the winter of '76.  
      It was in late November when I went out to start my trusty '65 Beetle (and
a sweet thing she was too).  We had a cold front come through that night and the
temp. was a balmy 10 degrees F .  Well old happy jack here gets in his vehicle 
like the fool he was (and is) and turns the ign. switch.   CLICK,  CLICK,  
CLICK.  Oh, the solenoid would fire and you could hear the hum of that 6v motor 
back there doing its damnest.  &quot;Gee&quot;, I thought to myself. I went around to the 
front of my treasure and opened the trunk.  I used to carry extra oil in old 1 
quart clear beer bottles.  This is when oil came in cans (for you youngins out 
there) and it made it a lot easier to pour.  Well I took that bottle and tipped 
it upside down and that oil just hung in there.  Hard as a rock.  I later 
purchased one of those heater element you can bolt underneath the oil sump 
plate.  I never used it 'cause I just switched to 5-30 in the winter and 10-40 
in the summer.  My baby never let me down again.  Those railroad tracks were my 
fault.

Carpy.
