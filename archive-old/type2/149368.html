&quot;With all this rain we've had, i got alot of h20 in the bus,&quot;

Tracy, try parking you bus facing UP a small incline.  The rain will run off 
the bus at the rear, and not at the front, right down your windshield seal 
and into the front of the VW

Of course, make sure the two drain holes at the rear, in your rain gutter 
are clear.....
