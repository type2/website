Subject: What's in the tank?

As quoted below,
Not to be gross, but........
When I bought my 72 Campmobile it was missing the filler cap for
the water
tank.  I don't know why, but I never gave a second thought as to
what might me
in the tank.  After my first camping trip, while I was draining
the remaining
water from the tank, I noticed the water drained very slowly.  No
big deal, I
just figured this was normal.
My girlfriend (wife now), brother, and I continued to take
camping trips for
the rest of the summer.  We had a great time sleeping in the bus,
using the
sink, drinking lots of water.
At the end of the summer I decided to pull the water tank out
because the slow
draining problem was getting worse.
The problem was easy to spot once the sink was out of the bus.
There was a dead mouse stuck to the bottom of the tank.
My brother and I just laughed about it as it obviously hadn't
hurt us, but
after 8 years and many bleachings and cleanings, my wife still
refuses to drink
water out of the bus.

Check those capless water tanks,

My heat ducts were packed with mouse nests and perhaps 5 mouse
remains.  At
least they were comfortable.

Not to be gross but that happened in my old 71 and I was told
from this list
that you have to worry about the urine or poop from the mice cuz
it could
cause some disease if humans breath it daily....but I guess you
would
breathe it unless the heat was all hooked up correctly.
