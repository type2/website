Hey Listers,

While it is true that our busses were made to camp, I believe a 
close-second purpose is to drive to hippie gatherings!  I loaded up 
my '71 riv with myself, my lovely wife, my lovely 16 month old 
daughter, another couple with their 16 month old daughter, and one 
other cool cat, and our various belongings. We cruized thru the Urban 
Wilderness of Denver CO, to catch the remnants of the Grateful Dead, 
known as the Further Festival.  About an 80 mile round trip.  1000 
lbs of smiles.  Not a problem, lots of waves and peace signs.  This 
was the post full -tune-up shakedown drive preparing for our epic 
journey to San Diego, by way of the Jerome festival in September.

I love driving the rolls royce of the Hippie subculture to a family gathering.
Makes you sit a bit taller in the seat....

By the way, I figured a really safe method of installing multiple car 
seats in the westie using cable, carabiners and turnbuckles.
