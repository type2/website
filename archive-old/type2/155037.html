Subject: RE: [T2] Original fuel Line Clamps

&gt; There were fuel injection screw clamps on top of
&gt;  the engine and some crimp clamps below.


We sell a Mercedes application that is similar to the original VW clamp, at
a reasonable price. As I recall it was Richard Atwell who originally came up
with this one.
