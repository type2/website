Subject: Re: [T2] Marvel Mystery Oil (was oil additive advise)

I am not sure what is in it but I was introduced to Marvel Mystery Oil in
1965. Since this product is still in business they gotta be doing something
correct.

My neighbor's 1982 Westy has a noisy lifter, hmmm! Another Christmas present
taken care of.

&gt; I have used Marvel Mystery Oil (SP?) with good results
&gt; (quieting noisy hydrolic lifters) but I would like to
&gt; know what it does specifically and why many on the
&gt; list generally thinks its the only additive worth
&gt; anything.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Rick

&gt; &gt; &gt; Pretty sure Dupont went to court to have their
&gt; &gt; name removed from at
&gt; &gt; &gt; least one of the snake oil ads
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The story I read said DuPont was asked by the snake
&gt; &gt; oil manufacturers to
&gt; &gt; sell them Teflon for use in the snake oil. DuPont
&gt; &gt; said no, Teflon doesn't
&gt; &gt; belong in motor oil, we don't want your product
&gt; &gt; damaging Teflon's good name,
&gt; &gt; no Teflon for you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The snake oil manufacturers took DuPont to court.
&gt; &gt; DuPont lost--once you sell
&gt; &gt; a product, you can't tell people what to do with it.
