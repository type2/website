&gt; As far as I can tell there are really only 2 other components to test:
&gt; The double relay and the wiring harness. Everything else seems to work
&gt; OK, or would not cause the current symptoms. I don't think the double
&gt; relay could cause this problem anyway.  We probably could have tested
&gt; my double-relay on Collie's bus too but he had a dinner to get to.


These are thoughts that sprang into my mind:

Check the ground attachments under the air distribution box and at the
double relay.

Check that the plug on the back of the fan on top of the engine
compartment is plugged in.

Do run the double relay check procedure from Bently although I doubt this
is the problem.

                             OOK!
