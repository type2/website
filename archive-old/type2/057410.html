That

Sealing the engine bay has a _lot_ to do with cooling!  The engine
draws its cooling air from the air vents, through the engine bay, and
exhausts the warmed air under the vehicle.

If you don't seal the engine bay to the engine, the warmed air beneath
the engine will be sucked back into the engine bay and back into the
cooling fan.  Which will keep the engine cooler, fresh cool air or
recirculated warm air?

This isn't a minor issue.  I've never happened upon an overheated bus
that had its engine tin and seals intact.  Invariably, some part of
the tin or seals is missing and that contributes to the overheating.
