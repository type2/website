Looks like we won't be able to keep this one, though it is eminently
keepable and restorable.  It is an almost completely original full pop
top, solid medium blue (probably &quot;Neptune Blue;&quot; I'll have to check).
The interior is hardly used.  The linoleum still has its blue-grey
speckled color and is unscratched.  The yellow vinyl folding-bed/seat
material is untorn and not sunburned.  The wood roof panels are unwarped
and unstained--only a little sanding and oiling needed.  (Sliding door
and rear door panels have gotten wet, however.)   Yellow canvas is dry
and intact but starting to disintegrate.  The cot is there and looks
like it hasn't been opened in thirty years. The middle stool is between
the seats.  Curtains are gone except for the one inside the closet.

The owner, who appears to be in her late seventies, could no longer
drive it, or she wouldn't have parted with it.  She bought it in 1970
with 12,000 miles on it.  It now has 179,000 miles.  (She said she
hadn't washed it in those 30 years, but neither did she bump it or
scrape it much.)  Once she was lightly rear-ended, so the rear apron has
been replaced, the engine door is slightly warped, and one can see light
Bondo and signs of an old repaint toward the rear. Battery tray is
rusted but inner and under panels look undamaged.  No other rust, except
small spots under the windshield--no visible holes.  Most of the rubber
is sunbaked.

The engine is all there and runs well.  She describes what sounds like a
top-end rebuild many years ago.  The transmission mainshaft bearing is
howling loudly for replacement, but the synchros work ok.  Could be
driven away some distance, but not too far. The bus is in Eagle Rock,
north of L.A. a few miles, between Glendale and Pasadena.  Will consider
shipping, including overseas. P-mail me for pictures and more details,
or leave a message at 323 883-1744 and I'll get back to you.
