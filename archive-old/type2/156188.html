Subject: [T2]Alignment

yes bus feels much much better... drives alot straighter and the steering wheel hasnt got over half as much play as it did before...TIGHT rrrrr Now~!~
   
  My thing is now knowing they did it wrong to begin with~!~ or it seems at least they did a lazy job cause once again another garage knows nothing about vw's or at least A Vw bus.... and i checked all over my area to keep from this haapening....
   
  course once again i blame myself for not knwoing enough about what was happeneing or i could have told him look you got to adjust the drag link...
   
  I am learning it just seems to all be the expensive and hard way....
   
  the bus still pulls to right though...... but nothing like it did....
  i still worry about it not being aligned....
  how can i know for sure that they did there job besides not doing the drag link....?
   
  what is the test to see if once again someone didnt do what they were paid to do?

  if the rest of the alignment is ok but the steering wheel is just not
centered then, yes they just need to adjust the drag link.

the drag link, and please dont be offended if you already know, looks like
a 3rd tie rod but it runs forward to back rather than side to side.
you adjust it just like a tie rod. pop one end off, center the steering
wheel, turn the rod (drag link) end so the length matches, pop it back in
and tighten it up.
