Subject: Re:towing weights? 

Hello Dave.......No, I didn't push the limit....but I did live to tell 
about it, and will. Perhaps more than you want to hear. Early apology for 
the bandwidth.

A general rule in trying to set up safe trailers is to set between ten and 
fifteen percent of the trailer weight on the tongue. This is to reduce the 
tendency to &quot;pitch-pole&quot; when the vehicle tops a sharp rise and flips the 
trailer ball up, at the same time driving the rear of the trailer down. 
Also, the rear wheel bearings are probably another limit on the amount of 
weight the bus manufacturer will allow at the hitch.

Working backwards from that 10% formula, and using 110 pounds as ten 
percent of the maximum trailer weight, we discover a trailer weighing 1,100 
pounds. If the 110 pounds be considered fifteen percent of the total 
trailer weight, that trailer could only weigh 733 pounds.

A 1,100 pound trailer without brakes would also fit the un-braked 
limitation mentioned in the original message.

I have towed a fold-down small trailer successfully behind my 1976 Westy in 
America, and it was closer to the 733 pound limit than the 1,100 one.

Another big consideration in deciding how to configure your trailer is the 
total frontal area of the trailer. When the vehicle gets up over 40 miles 
an hour, the wind resistance on that frontal area becomes increasingly 
significant. 16 square feet is far better than 36 square feet. The 16 would 
be about what a small folded down trailer would present. A taller stand-up 
hard side trailer six feet wide and six feet high would present 36 square 
feet of frontal area....twice the resistance at about 40 miles an hour. The 
faster the vehicle travels above that speed, the more the air becomes like 
a liquid. At 60 miles an hour, that 36 square feet would be like a 36 
square foot sail in a 60 mile an hour gale.......enough force to snap a 
mast on lots of sailboats.

If you ever sailed a small boat, you know that a 20 mile an hour wind makes 
for very lively sailing, and much over that creeps into the zone where 
things can break loose. 25 to 30 miles an hour is usually pretty exciting. 
Mark that lots of fun, until the mast snaps or the rigging lets go.

Think about it, and keep the towed weight low and light.

During my two years of knocking around Europe, I towed a small Swedish 
trailer over the Alps three times, using a new VW squareback sedan. 
Obviously, this was many years ago. Based on that experience, keep the 
speed lower than usual. 40 miles an hour gives you lots more response time 
and is much less demanding of your brakes and the other assets on your 
vehicle and yourself. Things you didn't ask about.............better clip 
it off here.

...snip........................
Trailer weight for my 78 is 2645lbs with trailer brakes!
without brakes is 1322 lbs.
but tongue weight of only about 110lbs....hmmmm
Anyone ever pushed this limit and lived to tell?&lt;grin&gt;
Cheers, dave
