Subject: Re: [T2] Getting cheaper every year

Michael,

Go buy a short piece of steel tubing.

Smash one end down to about the right size...slip it over
the driving flapper end and cut/bend correctly the other end(90 degree 
angle if I remember correctly).

Remove the two screws holding the other flapper in and reinsert...

Or buy a replacement from busted-bus like I did&lt;grin&gt;.

I am going to take measurements on mine before I install it so I can
get someone to make one out of metal when it breaks.

The other option is to get a solid rod that is larger in diameter
than the spade ends on the flapper.  Cut slots at the correct angle
in a short piece of it.  Then buy some steel tubing that will just fit 
over the outside....same reassembly as before.

Cheers, dave

&gt; How about the joining of the air flappers in the fresh air vents- the 78
&gt; I have uses a plastic dohicky shaped like a little cylinder with slots
&gt; to hold each flapper terminal-the lever pulls one flapper and it is
&gt; slaved to the next. this slave connector can (has) cracked)- I think
&gt; these were metal on earlier busses??

&gt; &gt; I swapped my 73 sun visors for some 71's this weekend.  The plastic had
