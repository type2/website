X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

My type2 is a 74 model with small pitch diameter wheels stud pattern.  As
for the offset inset issue, I'm sorry but I can't help here as they were
allready on the camper when I bought it.
  You could try emailing Big Boys Toys of Thurrock UK as they advertise them
for sale and should be able to tell you whether they will fit or not

Hope this helps.

&gt; Not too sure m8, mine had them fitted when I bought it.
&gt; They are shod with low profile tyres though.

&gt; &gt; Do you have to do something special to be able to put 5 spoke empi's on
a
&gt;
&gt; I assume the question ended with &quot;...Type 2?&quot;  For the first couple years,
&gt; the Bays had the wide 5 pattern just like the splitties.  My 68 is this
way
&gt; and I plan on putting Empi 5-spokes if someone can assure me there's no
&gt; difference between the Beetle and the Type2 offset/backspacing.  I asked a
&gt; couple weeks ago but got no response.  Didn't find anything in the
archive.
&gt; I've seen them on Splitties and it looks great.
