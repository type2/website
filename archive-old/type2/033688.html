Unca Joel (mailto:jwalker_at_URONRAMP.NET) strikes again.  Contact him, not
me.  I only re-post 'em.

haven't been watching the weather elsewhere: has anyone gotten any snow
yet?? :) well, if so, here's a blast from the past ... i don't know who
the
author was, and the only date i've got associated with it is 09/1995
(could
have been when it was written or just when i copied it from the list
email).
anyway, don't blame me for this one! ;)



           Send in the Plows
          (author unknown)
          sung to the &quot;Send in the Clowns)

  Isn't it white? Isn't it flat?
  The street is somewhere over there, beneath all of that ...
  Send in the plows.

  Don't we get weird, cooped up all day?
  Regress 'til we're Calvin and Hobbes! Go out and play!
  But where are the plows!
  Send in the plows.

  Just when I'd dug to the cars,
  Finally brushing them off to see which one was ours,
  Tried the ignition again, even got it to run,
  Another foot fell.
  Back to square one.

  I don't mean to bitch, or be unkind.
  But cross-country skiers on freeways are out of their minds!
  Call for the plows. How can they plow
  A street they can't find?

  Isn't it white? Isn't it bleak?
  Home on the modem today, one more net-geek.
  And where are the plows? There ought to be plows.
  Well ... maybe next week.
