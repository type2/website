Subject: Re: Source for SIR Rods?

&gt;Bob Hoover, who seems to still be MIA, recommends &quot;SIR&quot; as
&gt;a source of rods. I can't find a reference in the archives.
&gt;Anybody know what firm he is referring to, and an address or
&gt;phone number?

SIR is Southwest Import Rebuilders. Somewhere in CA.

800-331-4775
