Subject: Re: [T2] truckers, buses, PLF

Bob,

from what I can put together, the highroof was towing a SC w/ cargo box on it. 4-5 people in the lead vehicle, both loaded with stuff from octo/classic.

As David S. pointed out, how fast could they have been going? Perhaps 35?

If the trucker was doing 10 miles over the maximum (65max for trucks?) 
and the buses were going 15 under the minimum 
(yes there is one)
who's at fault?

This one might be a loser for the vdub folk.

Billy

&gt;did the trucker give any rationale???
