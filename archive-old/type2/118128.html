Subject: Re: foam under gas tank?

dan writ:

&gt; I was reading the manual on gas tank installation and it calls for
&gt;installation of foam under the tank?
&gt;
&gt;Anyone shed some light on this?

dan - the first thing that comes to my mind is the spongy foam, custom
shaped rectangle that lives between the opening for the gas line(s) and the
tank itself. its about 3&quot; by 5&quot;, maybe a half inch thick. otherwise, i've
seen gas tanks have one inch strips of padding from the factory that seem
to keep the tank from scraping metal-to-metal with the ledge upon which the
tank sits.  - steve
