Subject: Re: top speed

This is the kind of thread I usually stay out of, but I feel I have to
chime in.
I have had both type 1 and type 4 powered buses:
65 Sundial camper (no idea whether it was a 1300, 1500, or 1600)
79 European standard bus - 1600 dual port
74 Camper - stock 2 liter CJ dual carb (European spec)
79 Camper - stock 2 liter GE Cal spec FI
74 Camper - 2 liter dual carb built by Kummetat with approx. 100hp

The T1 was definitely weak and did not appreciate of speeds over 60 mph.
All the others easily do/did 70 mph (even the T2b 1600). With the type 4
engines I usually cruise around 75 mph with no problems whatsoever. With
the 100hp engine I just towed a car over a distance over 3500 miles
without problems. Though I needed shift into third a few times through
the Appalachians, even towing dolly with a car it would comfortably do
70-75 on level road and I do have a oil temp gauge.

If your bus does not do these speeds comfortably, you need to check your
engine. They were build to keep up with regular traffic and that means
going at least 70-75 mph in German traffic. Of course, you need to slow
down when it gets hot in summer, but with moderate outside temperatures
they can be driven and not babied.
