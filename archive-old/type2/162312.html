Subject: RE: 78 bus rotary compressor pics

Wayne,

The compressor and the mount came from Busdepot.  You can find the mount
under &quot;air control&quot; in the bus section.

The Sanden 508 came from BD also, but required a different &quot;head&quot;
to mount it as shown.  Glenn and Chris? may have more up-to-date
infor on the conversion as thre are others working on it as well.

Add in some mount &quot;fabrication&quot; and some changes in the hoses
and fittings as well as a belt and you have it.

It also depends on which system you currently have installed as well.
VPC or DPD as the compressor mounts are different.

Watch this space for pics of the differences&lt;rolling of eyes&gt;&lt;grin&gt;.
As you can see, it took me almost a year and a new camera to be 
able to get pics of the compressor.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Dave,
&gt; 
&gt; Nice pics - thanks.  I've been thinking about replacing my old piston
&gt; compressor (unknown condition - haven't found the right best as yet) with a
&gt; rotary... could you provide the parts list you came up with to install your
&gt; compressor (sourcing and pricing would be great if possible).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again,
