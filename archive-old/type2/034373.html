Subject: PROPANE FURNACE

Well, my furnace has NO electric hookups at all. thats why Im a little
puzzeld as how to get her going. After the coleman speculation I went out
and brought it inside(its raining out here) I cant see any manufacturer
tags. BUT there is a little metal flap that slides open. Im assuming I turn
the dial to let in the propane then stick a match in the hole to ignite.
then close and enjoy heat....OR blow myself up into &quot;693 pieces of
STEVE&quot;(coming to a theater near YOU!) Ill have more time to look at it wed.
We enjoyed a heat wave of 40 degrees over the weekend but it is now dropping
to the 20's again (weather is a fickle mistress) so Ive got my motivation.
Thanks all!!
steve
