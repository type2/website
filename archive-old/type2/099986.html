Subject: Re: [T2] Excellent tune up

&gt;As to a multi-meter, get a Fluke. Their $200 instruments sell all the time 
&gt;for $50 to $75 on the big auction web site by the Bay. You can drop it and 
&gt;it won't break in it's thick rubber holder, you can't hurt the micro amp 
&gt;ECU's with it, and you will have quality data for a lifetime of certainty. 
&gt;Far less costly in the long haul cause bad data is worse than no data.

Hi all,
I had no idea you could use a digital meter to set dwell.
How can this be done with a VOM? (Voltage Ohm Meter)
