For relatively inexpensive (still kinda pricey thought) find a local fire
firghter's supply shop, they'll probably have them.  I think that Gall's
(http://www.galls_dot_com)  might even have nomex hoods.  Or, go to your local
fire hq and ask if you can buy one from them.  I'm a volunteer, so I have
2 - for free!

&gt; I was an Army medic during the war and that film had to be edited to
&gt; eliminate some of the more gruesome sections...!
&gt;
&gt; as they say, been there did that, don't want it done to me!

His other favorite was the Air Force version. This one was of a fighter
pilot who was in an aircraft fire while he had his Nomex on.
(Off-this-topic: Does anyone here know where I can get a yard of Nomex
fabric? I'd love to have a hood on my welding helmet.) The Nomex kept his
hands from charring, but he still needed debridement because the top layer
of skin had been damaged from excess heat. To get the skin off, they made a
very shallow incision all the way around his wrist, then just peeled the
skin off like removing a glove.

The sick so-and-so (the safety NCO, not the pilot) checked the film out of
the Yongsan, Korea, Training and Audiovisual Support Center on a Friday
night and showed it at a company beer party. Don't do that.
