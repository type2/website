Subject: [T2] Re: Vanagon seats in a '78 Westy

Hey honey_bus, 

You have done something I have socsidered doing for years. So tell me:

I've heard that Vanagon seats sit about an inch higher than the 
originals. I thought this might make a tall person's head bump or maybe 
impair visibility. Is this a problem with yours?

I've heard the arm rests on the seats will hit of you rotate the 
passenger's seat to the rear. I've alsop heard that you either have to 
remove the arm rests on the door or the ones on the vanagon seats. What 
has been your experience?

I'm told the installation is really easy, but nothing about the bus is 
really easy. Any installation tips to share?
