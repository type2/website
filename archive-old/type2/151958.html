&gt; Oh my, I got the leak fixed a few days ago and everything was kosher.
&gt; Karl sent me the info below (thanks again) and it all seemed to go
&gt; perfectly... today, however, my van decided to get stuck in first gear
&gt; (this was over 100 miles after the repair). I drove about ten miles at
&gt; ten mph (yes, it took an hour!) on Route 66 in a terrential downpour
&gt; and dropped the rig back off at the mechanic who replaced the seals.
&gt;
heres' what the auto tranny book says about not shifting into 2nd or 3rd

. govenor dirty
. govenor drive defective
. govenor improperly assembled
. accumulator cover plate loose
. valve body dirty

the above can be repaired without removing the tranny

.  1-2 shift valve sticking
.  2nd gear brake band burnt or wornp

&gt; Does anyone know what the second gear brake piston does? And if you do
&gt; know, could it have been damaged or misplaced during the replacement of
&gt; the seals? Do I have an unrelated transmission problem? Will I someday

the second gear brake piston operates the 2nd gear brake band, it is very
possible that the piston did not fully engage and allowed the band to slip
and finally wore to the point of no longer engaging...


can you get into reverse??
does the tranny fluid smell burnt??

I hope that is not what happened because a worn or burned brake band is a
major drop the tranny open it up by someone who knows what thier doing and
lots of $$$$$

check the govenor it is cheap and easy to clean/fix

&gt; drive a domestic minivan?

I hope not

good luck
Bob
