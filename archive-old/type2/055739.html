I am trying to get a 71 bus inspectable. Nothing electrical was working on
it when I bought it. I've just got a couple of things left to fix (I've
surprised myself because I don't know much about what I am doing.)

The drivers side rear parking light is not working. It does work with the
turn signal though (I just got those working tonight.) Both filiments in
the bulb seem to be fine. I've tried a different bulb and got the same
results. I'm not sure what to test to trace the ploblem down (see I told
you I don't really know what I'm doing.) My Bentley hasn't arrived in the
mail yet, so I thought I'd ask here.

Happy Trails,
