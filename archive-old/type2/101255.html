&lt;&lt; There, you're done...

Enjoy, and remember to back off the cables, and get the wheels adjusted 
properly
with the star wheels (pumping and adjusting a couple of times to make sure
everything stays centered) THEN adjust the cables back up...you'll find the

works a lot better that way...

And remember to replace the rubber plugs to the adjusting holes...If you don't
got 'em; get 'em...A lot of the rust is the result of water (and whatever)
coming in the holes...
