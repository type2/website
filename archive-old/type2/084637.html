&gt;Asking prices for baywindow buses seem to have nearly doubled out here in

&gt;selling at the elevated prices, just my observation based on reading a lot 
&gt;of newspaper ads.
&gt;
&gt;Does this mean that baywindow buses have finally been &quot;discovered&quot;?


I think it's a matter of fewer chassis being available at a rate greater 
than a steady demand. The Yuppies are entering the market for a nostaligic 
hit, and have the money to hire/do a good restoration. Rarely do they do 
this to try to sell and make money. They aren't that stupid. If you bought 
a new T-II in 72 and sold it in 82, you may well see the logic of having 
another put right for half the cost of a new 2002 KIA. Now which one do you 
suppose will be worth more in 2022??? It can be a no-brainer if you 
consider long term value.
