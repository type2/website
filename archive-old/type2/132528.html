Subject: RE: [T2] proper way to tow type 2s

	Thanks, I have been reading for months and learning from you all a
lot. 

	I also marked the inner side and outer side.  I still don't know why
I had six mm cap screws in the CV's.  Must have been the PO.  The washer
plates (locking plates) were still there.

&gt;
&gt; 	Yup,  That is the assumption I made.  Car makers give limits on
&gt; speed and distance, however, why chance it?  I removed the CV joints so
that
&gt; the transaxle and automatic transmission would not spin at all.  This
choice
&gt; was easier because one CV had a torn boot and all the other boots are sad
&gt; looking and cracked.


DON'T FORGET to mark left and right, on an auto tranny the CV shafts are
different length
