Subject: why I drive a VW bus

Cha,

NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.  Right on.  Thanks for the reply.  I bet 
we would get along just fine.  You would be surprised how I can roll up in my 
patrol car to a &quot;hippie van&quot; and break down all barriers by talking about our 
VW's.  I've can't tell you how many times that happens.  The look on their 
faces at first when I pull up is one of, &quot;great, another pig harassing me.&quot;  But 
when we depart, it is almost always with a smile and pleasantries.  

If you couldn't tell by now, I'm pretty light hearted.  Why else would I 
dress up a hippie car like a Palestinian tank and drive it.  Thanks for the 
laughs...

John
