Subject: VW and righteous indignation...

&gt; Who exactly are you, anyway?  Or do you need to hide behind a gmail  
&gt; account?
&gt;
&gt; And your obsession with me is freaky, man.  You are one unhinged dude.
&gt;
&gt; I think it's time for you to stop this.  &quot;Pronto&quot; even.
&gt;


  Lmao... quite possibly the funniest response I have ever read on  
the internet.

For those of you who dont see irony in this topic...ummm... how is it  
so many of you are offended by unPC comments, when the history of the  
Company who's vehicle you own and love, has its roots in the worst  
form of unPCness in human history?

And if usage of a term like &quot;wetback&quot; sets your panties in a bunch,  
how do you justify owning anything VW in light of the companies  
blemished role in history?

Honestly, how do any of you sleep at night knowing the vehicle you  
has its legacy in one of humanities ugliest atrocities?

Where is your righteous indignation now?

Enjoy your rides tomorrow, hypocrites.


Scott
