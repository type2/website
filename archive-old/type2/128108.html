Subject: Re: [T2] Hanging an oil bath filter

I have one of these shelves that I cut out of my 71.
E-mail me and we'll arrange getting it to you if
you'll just pay for the shipping.

&gt;There is presently no hardware in the
&gt;engine compartment to sit the cleaner on -- the PO
cut off the shelf,
&gt;&gt;leaving only the vertical portion.
