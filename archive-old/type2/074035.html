Subject: Re: [T2] 81 Westy


I am an idiot at this time
&gt; trying to gather information to get more information.
------------
Avoid that extra battery until you know more about your Westy.
I've seen various configurations that use solenoids, relays and such but
I've also seen a bunch of burned up wire looms and blown voltage
regulators.
I'm sure you can live with one battery, 98% of us Van owners are.
