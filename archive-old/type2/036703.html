&gt;Hi list. I have a question about mounting gauges in my  ' 79 westy. I

&gt;it
&gt;now, I start to wonder if this placement won't be a bit difficult to

&gt;if it wouldn't be better to put them in a pod on top of the dash where 
&gt;they
&gt;fall directly in my line of sight while driving.

Never drill a hole that can be seen if you decide to remove what you 
mounted.
A hole is forever !
