Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket parts

To a bus owner, a part is a part. A bolt is a part. Unless the 
marketplace has been swept clean of them, there are still a lot of 
counterfeit bolts (I think they came from China) that shear when you 
look at them.

&gt; This is a counterfeit part, not an aftermarket part. While such items
&gt; exist, I have yet to find any in the present day Bus parts business. 
&gt; Old
&gt; bus parts are not exactly lucrative to counterfeiters.  If someone is
&gt; going to counterfeit a part, they will counterfit one that they can
&gt; unload quickly in volume before they are found out - not parts for an
&gt; old Bus!
