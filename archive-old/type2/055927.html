Subject: The wind doth blow!

Hi all,
I almost died on several occasions yesterday on the way home from the
Circle yer wagons trip.  The wind was absolutely unbearable on my 78
westy!  Aside from tires, what can I do to help keep from getting blown
off the road?  You name it...I'll buy it!
On another note, 
The Circle Yer Wagons weekend was a complete blast!  I have never had
more VW related fun in my life.  The folks couldn't be nicer, the rain
couldn't be wetter, and the beer any colder!  It was certainly a
humble-ing experience for my bus.  There were some nice rides there!
There is a show in Huntsville Alabama this weekend...info is at
www.tvvwa_dot_org...we are all camping at Monte Sano State park.  It is less
than 15 minutes from the show and has all the accommodations.  I just
found out that the artist formally known as Prince is playing on Friday
night in town, so be sure to cover your busses in purple velvet in his
honor :)
Is there a type 1 list?  I found a 61 beetle that looks interesting...

Later,

West E. Falia
