&gt; We (one female housemate, one male friend) turned her over for the first

&gt; this, just as I have with many problems before getting this far, but this
&gt; time I have run up against a wall.

take a peek here for some good things to get it going:

http://type2_dot_com/bartnik/carb.htm

If you have the timing set close enough, Use Muirs static test for
just a get it going thing. And the valves are adjusted properly, If
the carb is in good shape, this should get the motor to run. Some
other things that would cause a bad idle, are gunky carb, vacuum leak
,choke problems (which can go away when the engine is warmed up) or 
(like you are asking about) mis-adjusted carb. Good luck.
