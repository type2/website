Thanks to Bob Donalds at Boston Engine Exchange for sending me a copy of
the Technical Bulletin describing this process.  I converted the
bulletin to html and created new graphics for better visibility.  The
entire bulletin which covers, increasing piston/cylinder clearance,
replacing the head gaskets with cylinder base shims and finally the much
discussed modification to the connecting rods.  This modification allows
oil to splash onto the piston and cool the bottom of the piston.  Covers
motor cases GD, GE and CV.

The bulletin is at http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/techbull.html
