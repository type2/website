Subject: VW-early 1600 smog gizmo and air vents (somewhat off-charter)
Date: Mon, 19 Oct 98 13:40:17 PDT
From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

I have a question that ought to go to vw-aircooled but don't want to
bother subscribing only to listen to children message back and forth for
hours about how &quot;Chevy Rules!&quot; or the best way to lower a perfectly fine
vehicle to the point where it scrapes the ground.

Since my '71 Bus is out of whack, I have been borrowing a friend's nice
'67 Bug convertible.  I am the de facto engine mechanic on this ragtop so
an open-ended free lease is only proper and fitting.  I want to replace
his battered up oil-bath air filter (full of holes) with a cheaper
standard paper filter.  Funny thing is that besides the oil breather line
coming from the filler tube (which any aftermarket paper air filter thing
is equipped for), it also has a fitting that goes between the intake
manifold and the carb and ends up in a little pipe extending rearward.
The pipe is connected to a large tube about the size of a brake booster
line which goes to a small gizmo about the size of a small donut.  This
sits on a metal pipe that comes off the manifold preheater (the pipe that
runs from one rear exhaust outlet to the other and is intended to heat the
manifold and in turn the air-gas mix before it enters the heads).  In
turn, another hose goes to the banged up oil bath air filter.

What's this setup for?  The only thing I can think of is that the vacc
from the intake manifold opens a valve in the donut which in turn allows
hot air to flow into the air filter.  Seems unneeded to me, especially
here in Southern California.  Will the beast blow up if I remove the
manifold fitting from under the carb and take off the donut and plug up the
pipe coming out of the preheater?

On another note, he's been complaining of overheating in the hills.  I'll
check out everything else but I know he has a 1600 SP in there (was the
'67 bug designed for a 1600?).  He's also got the stock rain catcher
plates that channels rain falling into the rear hatch vents and then
down tubes to drain.  This might prevent water from getting on the dizzy
but the air holes that remain are just a little bit bigger than the hatch
hinges.  Seems to me we ought to get rid of the plates blocking the vents
and deal with rain in another way that doesn't restrict air flow.

What do y'all think or should I try aircooled.vw?


Thanks,

Nick
