Subject: Air Cooled Classics Porsche in Knoxville, TN

Hi All,

Has anyone ever dealt with &quot;Air Cooled Classics Porsche&quot; in Knoxville, TN?  
The guy seemed very curteous and knowledgable on the phone-- He said he could 
help me untangle in my mind how I want to build my 72 Westy's engine.  I'll 
be doing the work myself, but was wondering if I should listen to him-- his 
is the only shop I've found close by that can do machining on type 4 engines.

Thanks,
Jen
