Subject: Re: [T2] blaupunkt (70 westy)

&gt;i put my radio on my scanner and scanned the side and front of it. it
&gt;came out of my 70 westy and has letters on it that i dont understand. i
&gt;think it is R, L and M, but i may be wrong. i believe it does say
&gt;blaupunkt, though (been over a month since i looked at it, so i forget),
&gt;but the 2 knobs have VW emblems on them. is this an american radio or
&gt;perhaps have i lucked into ANOTHER european car? i can e-mail these
&gt;images to anyone who might be able to help me...

Some European radios had LW which is like AM I think, and then a couple of 
bands that would be in the shortwave range.
