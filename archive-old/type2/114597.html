&gt; i've heard straight 40W, but would like others advice
&gt; and the feedback on what they've run for years etc.

In Riverside, it's probably hot enough to run SAE40 pretty much all the 
time.  The Buslab guys over in Berkeley, however, only use Castrol GTX 
20W-50, and on their advice, that's what I put in my '76 at my last oil 
change.
