Last week my baby started acting up on a 2 hour drive home from the
beach.  About 20 miles from home she started to lose some muscle.  I had
the accelerator to the floor and she was dropping in speed.  When I
stopped at the end of the exit ramp, she stalled and I had to keep my
foot on the accelerator just to keep her running.  By the time I made it
home I couldn't keep her running and had to coast through stop signs and
pop the clutch to compression start her everytime she stalled (at least
20 times).
 
Anyway, does this problem sound familiar to anyone?  I'm kind of bummed
because I just got the damn thing a week before.
