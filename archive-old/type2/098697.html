No argument there.  I use the poppers for defrosting and defogging before
I drive the car, not for heat while camping.

I would not put one on the dash.  Too much heat on a cold windshield may
crack it!

In the bus, I put it in the walkthrough area between the seats.  In the
bug I put it on the floor behind the driver's seat with the driver's seat
folded forward.
