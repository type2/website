Subject: Re: [T2] general article on thermocouples

Sorry I forgot the ruthless imposition of ASCII thru our server.
The 'Option-shift 8' which shows me a nice 'degree' symbol is 
degraded to the symbol '0'.
I suppose we had better write 'deg'.   Or we could go real mahdrn and 
simply write ' C'.

&gt;	A main practical point, emphasized by several T2 TempSleuths,
&gt;is that the 'cold junction' should be at a steady temp.  If this cold
&gt;junction temp is not 0 0C
