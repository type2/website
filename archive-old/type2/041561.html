Subject: Tow Bar Question


&gt; I am thinking of making a tow-bar for a bus that will easily connect up
&gt; without having to disturb the brake booster as some tow bars do.
&gt; Thinking of making it so I can just remove the front bumper and bolt
&gt; the tow-bar on at the two center front bumper connection points.  That
&gt; would space the tow bar arms about 21 inches apart, and would have
&gt; the 4 front bumper bolts holding in in place.  Does anyone see a
&gt; problem with doing it this way??  Ideas and/or opinions are welcomed.
&gt;
  I just picked up a tow bar for a bus.  haven't used it yet, but, I think
it's made  to connect to the front bumper bolts some how.  It measures
26&amp;1/2&quot; across  where it connects to the bus.  I know it works because the
guy I got it from towed a bus back to the US, from, Baja Mexico with it.
