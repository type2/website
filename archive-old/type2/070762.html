&gt;o My question is.  How do we
&gt;get it started?  It has been sitting for so long that the pistons are
&gt;probably frozen.  How do we get it running without tearing the engine
&gt;apart?  We were told to put mystry oil down the plug holes for a week and
&gt;let it seep in and loosen the pistons.  Do you folks have any advice?


Check the oil. Make sure it's between the two notches, preferably closer to 
the top one. spray some wd-40 on the battery straps, remove battery and put 
on a couple of phone books and trickle charge it overnight. In the morning, 
put battery in, make sure the fan belt isn't super loose. start it up and let 
it run for a half hour. If the charge battery still doesn't turn it over, 
then remove the spark plugs and squirt a little bit of castrol oil into the 
spark plug holes there in from an old oil can that squirts -not too much- 
then be spinning the motor with a wrench on the generator nut until it 
loosens up. fire it up!
