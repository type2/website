Subject: Re: [T2] accelerator pedal

Paul,
Could be a few things.  First off...  Clean all the dirt out from under the
pedal.  And lubricate the hinge.

If that doesn't work... Are you running a Weber Progressive?  The reason I
ask is, I am and I have to use an extra spring in the engine compartment to
pull my pedal up all the way.

Hope this helps,

Snoopy
