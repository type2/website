&gt; I've got a 71 bus that apparently was modified by a company called

I've got a similar top on my bus, although it didn't come that way. I
scavanged it from another bus to make mine a camper. I believe that
there were more than one top style that Sportsmobile made for the
bays.

&gt; The problem I have is trying to find a replacement canvas tent for
&gt; it. I know I can get one custom made at a custom price.

My canvas was in good shape but you can get one from plf, look here
for more info: 
http://www.plfvw_dot_com/campmobiles/sportsmobile.htm

I cannot say how well/not well these are, just happen to know of it as
a supplier.

&gt; Also, am I missing something about keeping this fiberglas top up. It
&gt; seems to very top heavy and I could never trust it without some
&gt; additional supports than what it apparently has. 

It should stay up with no problems. The tension to hold the top is
held up by 2 VERY strong springs. These are similar to garage door
springs. I have some pictures of the top during work here for you to
look at if that helps:

When released from it's hold downs, it really likes to lift up. I sure
are not worried about it falling down, due to this.
