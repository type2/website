Subject: Re: Just a thought about holidays

I think you may be on to something there, John.  Sure, the insurance 
issues would have to be worked around but I like the idea.  If I could 
have a working Westy to wonder around the UK (or Australia, or the 
continent or..) for a few weeks I would gladly swap the same here (on 
the eastern slope of the Canadian Rockies).  A couple of years back I 
did a buy-it , then sell-it again when I was done deal in Holland but 
that was for 8 weeks in summer.  For shorter term holidays this could 
work nicely.

As to how to go about it - I guess the simplest way would be to have a 
publicly available list of potential participants with their location, 
vehicle , availability, etc. info
