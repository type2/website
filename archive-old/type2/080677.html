It was 73 when they moved the turn signals, changed the bumpers, etc.

Back when a bus was wrecked the only available nose was from the 73-79
model. Your bus was probably in a front end collision and repaired.

&gt; It looks to me that the front turn signals are in the wrong place.
&gt; They should be next to the bumper. In 1972 VW moved the turn signals
&gt; up next to the air intake.  However, I did once own a 1971 bus that
&gt; had the newer style front turn signals. That has always been a mystery
&gt; to me. Anybody know the story on that? The rear tail lights on that bus
&gt; were correct for 1971.
