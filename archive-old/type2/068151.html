&gt; For instance, how does one check for structural integrity, or the 
&gt; condition of the brakes, or the shape of the suspension,
&gt; or the transmission etc..? Common sense? 

Check for the obvious places for rust.  Also check for cut
wheel-wells, correct lights, correct interial bits.  

Peel back (or actually remove, if you can) the mats and check the
floors.  Check the battery tray, and all the underbelly.  Check
the nose for previous boo-boos.

Hook up a battery charger to it and see if the lights and stuff works.
This trick should let you know if you have decent electricals.
