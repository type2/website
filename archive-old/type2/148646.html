&gt; &lt;BTW a four-cylinder engine is capable of producing better MPG than a six 
&gt; or eight. This is due to the longer TIME for combustion allowed by fewer 
&gt; cylinders for better efficiency. The longer time for the burning process in a four 
&gt; is twice that of an eight. Thus an eight is inherently more wasteful of fuel 
&gt; in theory than a four or six. This simple fact is not well known. More 
&gt; cylinders shorten the time that combustion has to finish the total job of burning 
&gt; all the fuel.&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; From the acetone link...
&gt; 
&gt; I think I don't understand. I thought because a smaller 4 cylinder engine 
&gt; runs at higher RPMs to make power that it would have LESS time for 
&gt; combustion... My VW Cabrio runs at 3500 rpm, a big V-8 in the family runs at about 2200 
&gt; rpm for the same vehicle speed.

   You do...There are waay too many variables in this equation to make a 
blanket
statement about 4, 6, or 8 cylinder engines...Going by the acetone link, a 
single
cylinder hit'n'miss engine would get the best mileage of all, but you 
wouldn't
wanna drive one... ;-(
