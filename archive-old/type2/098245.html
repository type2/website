&gt; What do you want 30-50 Amps for??? That would be 360 - 600 Watts. Even
&gt; if you go with 100 Watt high beams, 20 Amps should be plenty. The higher

You usually want to fuse the circuit to 2 or three times the expected
current, so as to prevent inadvertant fuse problems due to inrush current
when the lights are first turned on.

This is really pushing the limit, as the Germans tend to design closer to
the edge than Americans.  Still, nothing succeeds like success.
