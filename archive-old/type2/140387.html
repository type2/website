Subject: temp sensor II question...like where is it:)

Hi,
I have been trying to figure out where the heck my cylinder head temp sender
is? Clementine is 1977 FI Westy.  I have a wire coming out of the #3 spark
plug hole that I figure is the CHT gauge wire. But okay don't laugh but how
and where is the temp sensor II? I don't see where it would be inside the
engine compartment. Is it accessed for under the bus? Good grief I feel dumb.
I looked in Bentley but I still don't understand. Ugh just need a little
help...
Meg
