Subject: CO Meter - any suggestions?

I am considering buying a CO meter/detector that I could use to adjust my 
Carbs with. It would also be nice to have one that I could use on a boat to 
check the air quality. 

What do you guys and gals know about this Grainger has a couple that attach 
to multi-meters, one for $200 (universial) and another for $199 (Fluke). I 
have a fluke meter, but the cost seems high for such a simple device and it 
does not look like the device would insert into the tail pipe.

I have also seen ones at the hardware store for aprox $50.00 that have a read 
out, but again I am not sure how the would do the tail pipe. 

Thanx,

Tom
