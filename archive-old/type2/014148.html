Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck valves and promises 

&gt; I would do the method that Karl described in his post to the list on
&gt; finding cylinder 1, tcd, and then put the shaft in place.  Then install
&gt; the distributor and see how it situates itself and what direction/plug
&gt; in the cap the rotor is pointing towards (hopefully towards the notch on
&gt; the distributor rim).  Then put the cap on, hook up spark plug 1 to the
&gt; terminal that the rotor's pointing at and then plug the rest of the
&gt; cables in the cap in the appropriate places. (1234 counter clockwise
&gt; from 1)
&gt; 
&gt; Make sure that you put the driveshaft in the correct way.  Be sure to
&gt; note that one side of the groove is fatter.  If you flip it, the
&gt; distributor will be off 180 degrees.

ayup, done.

&gt; That should work unless, like karl said, your cam shaft is not aligned
&gt; with the crank.  that would suck.

ok, here's where i'm confused:


a) install the dizzy drive shaft at #1 TDC
b) install the dizzy properly
c) put rotor on
d) setup plug wires so that the one the rotor is facing is #1
e) turn over car with timing light attached to #1:  

result:
the 180 degree mark comes up.

This just seems very wrong to me (esp. since the bus was yesterday).

I know i'm at TDC -- I've verified it with a screwdriver in the #1 plug hole.

If the rotor is theoretically pointing at #1 _at_ TDC -- as described above --
there should be NO WAY that the timing light flashes at the 180 degree mark...right?

Argh!
