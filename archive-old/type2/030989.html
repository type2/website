&gt; Well, I've been listening to my 79 bus get louder and louder out the back

&gt; muffler.  (As far as I know, that's all that I need but am not sure.)  With
&gt; any other vehicle, I'd probably think &quot;Midas&quot; first, but I know that I
&gt; can't think within that paradigm as a bus owner.  Basically, what is the

actually one of the &quot;better&quot; Midas shops could pull it off, they have
access to just about every muffler ever made, it might have to be a
special order item, and it for sure won't be 49.95 but they can do it.

&gt; but I do know that a muffler install featuring clamping rather than welding
&gt; (a la Midas) is the way to go.  So, in general, is this something that my
&gt; trusted (really) German shop should be able to acquire and take care of, or

sure the German Shop can do it.  heck this is one of those &quot;get your hands
dirty&quot; jobs that is perfect for first time mechanics.  talk to Ron at Bus
Depot or RMMW or any VW parts supplier.  they will be able to give you a
complete &quot;kit&quot; of all the parts you will need, and probably tell you what
tools you'll need.  

and certainly most everyone here on the list has probably changed a
muffler or two over the years.

&gt; am I gonna have to find the component(s) through mail order, junkyard or
&gt; other means and then get someone to put it on right?  I have a 79, so I'm

certainly all of these routes will work

&gt; kinda concerned about hard-to-find pieces.  Any advice, past experiences or
&gt; any other contributions are welcome and appreciated.

these particular parts are not hard to find items
