&gt; I have a really neat marine CB antenna, but still haven't figured
out where or 
&gt; how to mount it on our Campmobile.

&gt; A bumper mount is out for 2 reasons;  a lot of performance would be
lost by 
&gt; reducing the antenna's height above ground, and when folded down
it'd be in 
&gt; the way of the door(s) and vulnerable to damage.

Another reason you don't want to place it next to the body is that the
horizontal proximity to sheet metal will play havoc with the SWR match.

&gt; I don't want to punch any 
&gt; holes in the van, so bolting it to the front part of the roof isn't
an option.
&gt; 
&gt; I considered mounting it to the forward part of the poptop, but that
doesn't 
&gt; appeal to me because of the need to drill holes in the fiberglass. 
Besides, 
&gt; it sticks up so far I'm afraid the &quot;windage&quot; would tear it right out
of the 
&gt; poptop.
&gt; 
&gt; What's a body to do.....?

I'm not sure if you intend to use this antenna in motion.  It seems
quite large, so you'd probably run afoul of the 13' 6&quot; height limit. 
I have a colinear 2m antenna that is a couple of inches over and it
takes a good whack now and then.  It's made of thin stainless wire and
takes the hits quite well, but fiberglass wouldn't be as tough.
