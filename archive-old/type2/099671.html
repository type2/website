Subject: Re: [T2] Tank to body seal

Maybe they weren't sealed up for the same reason boats have bilge blowers - 
to keep explosive gases from collecting there.

And then again - maybe they realized it saved them $.05 on each vehicle and 
over the production of a million vehicles this is a grand sum of money.
