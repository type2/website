&gt; In the future can people just say straight up

OK. Use what the vehicle manufacturer specifies, nothing more or less. 
;) Besides it's springtime, and these sorts of threads come and go, 
don't let it get you down.


&gt; example ...' I prefer this plug X, there has been
&gt; some varied results with others'

I can say from expeience that I used a Bosch plug set my VWFLAPS gave me 
when the NGK set was out of stock. I saw an immediate change. It would 
not idle correctly, and the 2 days I drove it the gas mileage went down. 
I cannot explain it, but when I put the used NGK plugs back in all went 
back to normal. So in that case I saw a change right away. So that was 
my experience.

&gt; I'm not trying to save a buck, just wanting the
&gt; bus to run good. Which is why I asked. I didn't fall
&gt; into any trap of advertising. Just couldn't find a plug
&gt; in the city except those that would work with the
&gt; bus.

Sounds like your gut feeling is the bus still doesn't run up to snuff. I 
believe the best advice is to heed the list advice and purchase a set of 
plugs that should work better with your older style ignition system.
