&gt;  It is fairly rare to have engine case halves that are 100% leak free

That's a strong recommendation.

I now have:

A can of Gasgacinch that I know I'm not going to open or use
A can of Napa/Permatex aviation sealant
A strong recommendation for Kuril T that I feel guilty about not getting
A strong recommendation and testimonial for Loktite 574 (but shipping 
from German Supply takes well over a week)
A technique (floss) that I have to practice before I decide whether the 
use it
A single experience closing a different case without any sealer at all 
that I know worked, first hand, but might not work with this case

This is getting to be like the &quot;what's the best oil&quot; thread! If I had 
six buses, I'd run an experiment.
