Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] marking ignition wires

Bob:  I have a drawer full of heat shrink tubing, the largest of 
which has an ID of maybe 5mm. Is this what you use? If so, how do you 
find a piece that is large enough to slip over the plug or 
distributor ends pieces and still shrink to fit the wire?

Richard: It is difficult for me to understand what the markers are 
and how that special tool works. Can you explain?

Jack
