&lt;&lt; Has anyone had any experience repairing holes that have rusted under the
&gt; windshield of a bay window bus?
&gt; Is it a nightmare?  How is the best way to repair it?
 &gt;&gt;

Not windshield-specific, but has anyone tried the/any of the newer
panel bonding compounds for repairs? I've read of the stuff but only
in factory/perfect use or the usual hype from the manufacturers...
I'm assuming it does work, since some manufacturers are using the
stuff, but I'm curious as to real/backyard success/failure...
