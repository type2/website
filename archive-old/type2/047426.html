Subject: Fw: [T2] Honda motor into my 71?

&quot;A 1.6l Honda may not have a lot of power. They lack the torque to
pull a bus, but could not be any worce than a 1600cc VW motor.&quot;


Now, this is interesting to me, because I live in blissful ignorance of
'normal' acceleration.  I cheerfully hold up traffic in all my cars,
eventually cruising with everyone else (except in my beloved bus, of
course).  Now, I'll go see if my Honda manual lists the torque and see how
that compares to a DP 1600 in good condition (compression's fine in all
four).  If the Honda motor is on a par with my bus's, that's good enough for
me.  Anybody know what the torque figure is on this bus?

How big a deal is it to flip the ring and rig up motor mounts?  Anybody want
to take a shot at the whole cost for parts?  I like the idea of putting the
radiator up front where my front mounted spare goes.  I'm a better plumber
than a body guy by a long shot.  And let's not forget:  I've got the motor
and all the rest in my garage.

Anybody else got 2 cents worth?
