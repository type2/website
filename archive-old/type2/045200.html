Subject: Re: [T2] Bending brake lines yerself

Hi James,

Use a tube bending tool with a size matching the diameter of the brake line.
Take off one steel line off at a time. Lay the line on a flat surface. Bend
one section of the new line at a time and check that the lengths are very,
very close.  When done, both should look pretty much identical.  Practice on
a piece of straightened coathanger wire or welding rod to get the technique.
I still mess up a line now and then.  Watch for where the curve of your bend
starts and ends, and try to get a feel for it.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt; Anyone successfully bent his/her own brake line.  All the brake lines you
&gt; buy come straight.
