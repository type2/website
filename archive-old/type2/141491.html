From: &quot;The Bus Depot&quot; &lt;type2_at_busdepot_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Incidentally the Just Kampers one is the one we sell ...

Part of the description reads &quot;(Note: Not compatible with Deluxe busses,
that have 'armrest' style air ducts mounted on the front door panels.)&quot;

Didn't know I had a Deluxe '77 bus.  And here I was going to remove the
ducts when I redid the door panels.
