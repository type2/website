&gt; while most of you would probably rebuild yourself, i have no such luxury.
&gt; i am severely constricted by time and money and *must* put a new longblock

I've made that mistake and it cost me plenty.  rent a car, take the
transit bus, hitchike, but take the time to do it right

pick up a junkyard engine and put it in while you rebuild (also means you
will have a spare later

&gt; i've been on the look out for distributers of rebuilt/new longblocks and
&gt; was dissapointed to find only a few.

and most of those have spotty records

&gt; unfortunately this is really my fist experience *ordering* parts of any
&gt; kind from such manufacturers/distributors, let alone an entire longblock.
&gt; i am pleading for some input on quality of companies - basically: where do
&gt; i go to get a motor that is going to last me a  few months at least before
&gt; 
&gt; GEX - does not seem to have my motor that i know only as a 1600 dual port -

STAY AWAY FROM GEX, the only thing they have of quality is their
advertisements.

&gt; i suppose i can put in whatever if i'm getting a new longblock, so what
&gt; *should* i put in? a 1641? and what does &quot;rear mount&quot; specify?

what always works best it seems is what VW put in it originally.

&gt; please, please tell me what my best options are, i want reliability and can
&gt; possibly afford $900 or so... my suspension and lack of tires/rims will

Maybe a Beetlemex engine will work. they are brand new.
