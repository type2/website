 Has a Ford 2.3l engine installed... 

That abomination has been for sale for years...I
think by three different owners.  There must be
something terribly wrong with it, because each
new owner has it for sale again within months for
a lower price.  I think this one is even using
the same pics as the last.  It's been in Oregon
all along.
