Subject: Re: [T2] Overheating was Re:Mexico

I think that you are right.  I looked at one of those and they appeared to
have an in-line 4 cylinder water cooled engine, the black box in front was a
radiator.

I saw only one vintage bus, but A/C many bays, as well as new combi's, only
1 vanagon.

&gt; I don't think all of the busses are aircooled.  Even the ones that look like
&gt; late model bay windows have the black grille looking think on the front
&gt; clip.  This appears to be a radiator suggesting that these busses are
&gt; waterboxers.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I totally off base on this one?

&gt;&gt;&gt; We vacationed in Mexico recently.  We flew into Cancun, and went
&gt;&gt; immediately
&gt;&gt;&gt; to Isla Mujeres.  We then went to Cozumel.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; It appeared to me that about 30-50% of the autos in Mexico are air-cooled
&gt;&gt;&gt; bugs, busses, things, dune buggies, etc.  It was pretty cool.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Even in that high temp environment, tropical not temperate, must not be too
&gt;&gt; many spec (Mexican specs and tolerances and metalurgy even) air cooled
&gt;&gt; motors burning up from overheating. I would guess that the only ones
&gt;&gt; destroyed from excess heat are the ones with aftermarket cooler setups or
&gt;&gt; other out of spec running.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I expect they all run pretty cool when maintained spec. This means also
&gt;&gt; that you do periodic inspections and when you see oil progressing from
&gt;&gt; weepage to leakage, you fix it. Leaking is not  spec. When this is allowed
&gt;&gt; over many months and miles, the oil film will creap into the cooling air
&gt;&gt; stream slowly over time. This wets the oil cooler and cylinder fins which
&gt;&gt; combines with dust to clog the matrix and insulate the fins. Result,
&gt;&gt; diminished out of spec cooling system function. Eventually, the last grade
&gt;&gt; is met that warps the rings or burns a valve prematurely due to lack of
&gt;&gt; maintenance when you ignore the leaks. Check Bentley. Inspection for leaks
&gt;&gt; is at the head of every lubrication inspection. It may not go on to say,
&gt;&gt; &quot;Fix any leaks found.&quot;, but it is implied and certainly is essential for
&gt;&gt; proper function.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Doktor Porsche understood these potentials for reduced cooling which is why
&gt;&gt; you won't even have an overheating problem if you continue to ignore out of
&gt;&gt; spec conditions until cooling efficientcy has been reduced substantially,
&gt;&gt; like maybe 20% or more.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Every hole in the tin without a proper seal adds to loss of system
&gt;&gt; efficientcy. Spec is all seals in place, or at least a duct tape temp fix,
&gt;&gt; to prevent unnecessary heat flow to the cool side. Also, holes in the tin
&gt;&gt; mean a bit less air passing the cylinders.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Your mainenance inspections must be adjusted for the specific way you use
&gt;&gt; the vehicle. By inspection only can you KNOW what the proper maintenance
&gt;&gt; intervals are. Rule of thumb milage/time intervals are not applicable to
&gt;&gt; over 50% of the vehicles on the road if you have in mind maintaining the
&gt;&gt; value of the vehicle for extended ownership and use as troublefree
&gt;&gt; transporation continuiously.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If you must go non-spec because you have a non-spec criteria you want to
&gt;&gt; meet beyond what the factory design team contemplated, like I want more
&gt;&gt; horsepower than they gave me, then you have the task of engineering the new
&gt;&gt; application and being responsable for it's success or failure. If your
&gt;&gt; modification is engineered with the same safety margins as any good
&gt;&gt; engineer would allow, it can function properly and reliably. Bergs have
&gt;&gt; shown what can be done with enhanced engineering with the T-I motors.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If you are spec you will not overheat. If you overheat, you are not spec or
&gt;&gt; you are outside spec operating parameters by a big margin.
