Subject: RE: [T2] Actual shipping

IF you'll read the comment: &quot;What's next, a charge to take our money to the
bank.&quot;

I was referring to the guy who said he actually had to drive a product to
the shipping center.

Of course they charge to keep our money there, they have expenses too.

There's no end to this discussion..except that hopefully those out there who
charge for shipping will actually get it.
As customers we just want to know how much and when and what quality. If
it's too much or too inconvenient, we'll go elsewhere. That process will at
least take one seller or another out of the discussion, or it will cause a
seller to consider how to better serve customers and still make a living.

What bank do you bank at? They already charge us to keep money there.

What's next? A charge for taking our money to the bank.

Give me a break.
