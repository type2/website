Hello all!


As you may already know, I am in the process of
getting my '70 Westy restored.  The paint is all done
and all new seals are now going in.  I could not do
the rubber instalation myself as the bus must be ready
to drive when it leaves the shop, and I am spending
every waking moment at work so I can pay for this.

I was told that it took three men 3 hours to put the
right rear side window w/o the vent wing back in the
bus.  Now, do you guys think that they will charge me
three times three men working _at_ $35 an hour?  This
would add up to $400 to put in that one window. The
idea that they would charge me $400 to put in one
window seems very unreasonable to me.  Could they
instead charge me some standard fee for putting it
back together?

The end is in sight, but how much will it cost?
