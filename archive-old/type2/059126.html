Subject: Bosch Points #01 009 crazyness!

WTF is up with this stuff?:(

Bought two sets of these, from RMMW (which are correct for distributer 131
905 205 according to their charts and Jim's _at_ Old Volks Home..)...

When they got here, i noticed they were both two piece points.  but having
never dealt with anything this old before, figured they'd fit just like
they should.

Got the dizzy off today and took the old ones out.  Even went so far as to
seperate them from their base, to try to figure them out.
'
the old &quot;base&quot; has a brass (?) pole that sticks up from the end, and has a
little nipple that sticks down below, into the points plate.  the Spring
and hingish thing that consists of the rest of the points slips over this
pole.

My new points (both sets are identical) just have a large hole where this
pole is.  Even if i managed to remove the pole from the old points, the
base of it is to small to fit in this hole!!!



anybody have any suggestions?  Ideas as to why?  ANYTHING?:)


A few further notes:  I pulled one of the dozen sets of 01 011's off the
shelf, and checked them out.  The base on them is like the old points,
with the pole.  But they have the right angle spade on them which gets in
the way...Pulled them apart, and they new part from the 01 009 fits
perfectly.  This is what I shall use for the moment, i guess.

Still wanna know whats up with this though!!

And, another note....Got 2 sets of NOS(dunno how old, but they look old!) 
points in hard plastic cases..unopened, blah blah.   Label on top reads:
Schier-Kontakte  Made in Western-Germany

side readsL  Original Schier-Kontakte
	2172verwendbar f. Bosch-Zunder
		(ZVKT 4 sort 3)

These appear similar to these 01 009's i have, with the large hole and
all.  But they have no wire attatched at all!  It appears the spring would
attach to the base using a small bolt and nut, and the wire would attach
to that assembly....interesting.:)

Well...i'm gonna go put these 01 011/009's in now...*sigh*
