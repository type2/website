Subject: 79 2000 FI won't start - smells like gas 

Dear Type2,

My Van has been running well for months.  This week I have had to have it
towed home twice.

I put in a new fuel filter.  It has a new coil and all four spark plugs fire
well.   Compression is low but enough (I think) 90,90,75,90.  Pressure in
the fuel line is #40. Now it won't start and the engine compartment reeks of
gas.  When I pulled the spark plugs, they smelt of gas and had a black dry
coat.

I recently put a gasoline &quot;cleaner&quot; additive in my gas tank (Prolong) and I
wonder it this ruined the injectors somehow.  I suspect the injectors and or
cold start valve.

What is the best way to test the injectors?  What does the intense gas smell
indicate?

Thank you for your help, Chris Walker
