Subject: Electric fuel pump safety

I'm a bit of an electronic numbskull so I thought I'd approach the brain
trust for help on one.  I want my bus to be safe and my electric fuel pump
to run only when the bus is running.  I have a late 2.0 with an electric
fuel pump that feeds dual PDSIT carbs.

How do I rig a home made double relay so that the fuel pump only gets
current when the starter motor is running or when the engine is running?  I
get the starter motor running half of the equation but I'm not sure how to
do the other half of keeping the fuel pump energized when the engine is
running.  Should I run the second relay off the oil pressure sender?  Is
that even possible?  This seems like a weak solution since most of our oil
pressure lights will occasionally flicker at idle when the engine is hot.
Mine does anyway.  This would in turn cut off the fuel pump.

How have you guys solved this one?  I'm currently just hot wired in so my
fuel pump runs when the key is on.  I feel like a huge fireball just waiting
to happen!  Not good...

Thanks in advance,
Clark
