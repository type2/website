Tobin,

        Don't mean to be making anybody's momma crazy, which is the very 
reason I am asking for help in FINDING the source of the odor.  It is the 
strangest thing. The odor seems to be most prominent in the FRONT of the 
bus.  There is absolutely NO gas odor in the engine compartment.

        For those of you who suggest that it is simply a matter of 
dropping the engine and removing the tank, I must advise that I, like 
many bussers I have met, have neither the garage, tools, mechanical ability, or $$$ to do it the most 
obvious way.  

        I would like to attend one of the camping trips so that some of 
you who are so knowledgeable might give me some &quot;hands on&quot; direction.

        Thanks for all the advice.
