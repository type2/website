Subject: Exhaust Questions

Hi Folks,

When I got my new engine, I put on an EMPI free-flow muffler for increased 
performance.  The exhaust system in question looks like a T4-specific 
version of the dual quietpack -- coming from the heat exchangers, it has 2 
pipes that go to 2 mufflers that hang parallel to the rear bumper, with a 
chrome tip on each end.  It works well, and I've been pretty happy with the 
sound and performance.

I walked out to my Bus today and noticed that one of my mufflers was hanging 
at an unusual angle.  Upon closer inspection, I noticed that one of the 
welds holding the muffler to the pipe was broken, and the engine's 
vibrations had opened a crack in the inlet pipe to the muffler.  It appears 
that the mufflers just rusted too much for the weld to hold, and it let go.

So, it looks like I will have to get a new exhaust, and I was wondering if 
people had any preferences for free-flow exhaust choices.  While I have been 
happy with my EMPI unit, it does not appear to have been very well made, as 
it has rusted to the point of failure after only 2 years.  Are there 
better-quality units out there for reasonable prices?  Does it make a 
difference whether there's 1 muffler or 2?

Also, I've been looking for exhaust gaskets for the head-to-heat-exchanger 
connection.  Any suggestions for a parts source for a GD-code engine?

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.

Take care,
