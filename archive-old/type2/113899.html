&gt;However, this is not a new problem, but when i brake the bus turns to the left. The faster i'm going, the harder I brake, the more it turns. I have been told that this is a faulty brake hose.
&gt;
&gt;Which hose is it?

That would be the right hose.
But replace them both because if one failed, the other is likely to fail very soon.
They are around $10 from a VW flaps or internet vendor.

&gt; They are not filled with brake fluid correct?

Yes, they are filled with brake fluid.

&gt;  Why does it make the bus turn?

If one hose becomes plugged, it will reduce the effectiveness of the brakes on that wheel.  Also, when you release the brakes a plugged hose can cause residual line pressure which can cause the brake pads to drag.  If your bus pulls to the left under braking and your right brake pads are more worn than the left ones, it's very likely you have a faulty hose.  They seem to last about 25-30 years before they do this.
