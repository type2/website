Subject: Re: Found a really neat Die-Cast...

I was in Wal-Mart last night getting a last minute Birthday gift for a friends
child, and was in the toy area. My Husband Brad was looking at the die-cast
cars and came across this really neat Splittie. It's a customized VW drag bus
by hot wheels it's 1/18 scale, it was $20.00 we paid $15.00. We collect alot
of die-cast collectables but this is the coolest by far. It was the last one
on the shelf, lucky us.  :) It's through the 100% Hot Wheels and the ans is
called Customized VW Drag Bus (29227) is the number beside the list of other
ones available....
