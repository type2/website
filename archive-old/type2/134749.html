Right. I just had surgery Wednesday, so the doctor estimates it will be 
about 6 weeks before I can get in and break the drive train down for an 
&quot;autopsy&quot;, so I guess we are at an impasse for now. But you and Gerald have 
put me on the right track for tracking down this transmission mystery.
