Subject: Re: Shock fitment problems?

This has happened to me before, what happens is the sleeve from the old shock
gets rusted to the stud that sticks out for for the shock, when you remove your
old shock the sleeve stays put. I usually soak it for a while with WD-40 or the
likes then use the vise grips to turn it, screw it, hammer it off. By hammering
it off I mean hitting the vice grip handle, not the stud. I would remove the one
that's on the stud, not on the shock as I would think it might be glued or
attached some other way and would ruin your rubber when you try to remove it.
Good Luck

&gt;    Hi volks,
&gt;    Wondering if anyone in the bus world has ran into this?
&gt; Went to the local Autozone to get front shocks for my 69 bus. After helping
&gt; the kid look them up ( he had no clue what a type 2, or a transporter was) I
&gt; went home with a pair. When it came time to replace them, I got the old ones
&gt; off with no problem- but new ones would not bolt on.  Problem was this: Top
&gt; goes right on over hardware- but bottom doesn't. The lower shock mounting
&gt; &quot;stud&quot; is bigger in diameter than the steel &quot;sleeve&quot; in the end of the shock.
&gt;     I took the shocks back to the store, explaining my problem. The counter
&gt; guys tell me that I just have to remove the steel sleeve from the end of the
&gt; shock- exposing just the rubber bushing. Does this sound right to anyone?  If
&gt; it is right, any tips on removing the steel &quot;sleeve&quot; without killing the
&gt; rubber bushing?  It appears that the sleeve is glued to the rubber bushings.
&gt; Half the reason for replacing current shocks is because the rubber bushings
&gt; are worn out. Or maybe I have the wrong shocks?
&gt;     Thanx for any help.
