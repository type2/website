Subject: Idle problem

Hi Volks,
I have an idle problem that is driving me nuts (not really a drive-just a
short walk). My idle will return to about 1500 rpm's and after about 10/15
seconds go down to 800/900 rpm. No amount of adjusting the carb seems to
have any effect. If I adjust it down when it is at 1500 to 950 rpm, it will
just drop to 600 after a short time.
Here is what I have tried:
1. Valves adjusted to spec
2. New carb
3. New intake boots
4. New intake manifold gaskets
5. No evidence of vacuum leak.
6. New spark plugs, rotor, cap, and wires.
The engine is a 1600 DP with berg extractor, Jacobs ignition, compu-fire ,
and new rotor, cap, and wires.
Anybody have any suggestions, hints, tips, tricks, voodoo, magic, or any
other advice on what to try next? As always, TIA TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
