Jason,

About 18 years ago I had an extremely bad experience with a Midas shop is 
Santa Rosa Ca. and Bellevue Wa. The SR shop charged me for a brake job they 
didn't perform. I had trouble in Washington they took my warranty and handed 
me brake pads. When I removed the hubs I found the original German pads!  A 
couple of nasty letters later they agreed to inspect my work. I think they 
topped the fluid Reservoir.
Since then I do most of the work myself. My 2 cents.
