Subject: Panel surgery - where to buy?

Hi all,

I'm heading for another milestone in my relationship with Millie, the
'71 Westy - after working on the rust for a week or so, I've decided
that some panels just need to be replaced, and not patched... rockers on
both sides, and the piece in front of the rear wheels on both sides. 

So that's my question, I guess... who should I buy them from? Right now,
the only catalog I have with panels in it is JC Whitney... I know a lot
of people have bad stories about them, but I've never really had a
problem...

Thanks right up front for advice, info, and help - 

Anton
