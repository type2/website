Subject: Engine tin grommets

Since my engine is now out of my bus, I snagged all my engine tin from my
mechanic so I can paint it. I pulled some rubber bits off today when I
prepped the tin, and since I've got the pieces out of context I don't know
what these rubber bits are called or if they're available for replacement.
Help me! :-)

1) The spark plug wire holders are easy to identify and replace.

2) There's a fat grommet, 5/8&quot; ID, from the big piece of tin that covers
the fuel tank at the front (FIF) of the engine compartment. There are two
other holes in this piece of tin; should they have grommets, too?

3) I pried out a plastic (or very dried rubber) plug next to the #4 plug
hole. It has these numbers on it: A 396-46.

4) I've got an oval grommet about 3.5&quot; long by 2&quot; wide. Part number looks
like 021 119 2(?)37.

5) Big rectangular grommet about 5.5&quot; long by 3.5&quot; wide, with one corner
rounded off. Part number 021 119 329. (Bus Depot didn't list this PN.)

I lost the URL for the on-line parts fiche when my computer crashed the
other day. Anyone got the link handy?

Oh, and I forgot to tell y'all, in all the engine replacement fact-finding
frenzy: The reason the right side of my engine, particularly the #2
cylinder, didn't respond to the simple test of pulling each plug wire at
the distributor is because the #2 piston is oily. Compression was OK -- go
figure.
