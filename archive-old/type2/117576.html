did you remove engine and tranny together??  I usually just remove the
engine alone, fairly easy on an auto tranny bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Everything functions perfectly It drives fine, just
&gt; not ligned up.

it is one bear to adjust, not because it is hard but you have to be in
several places at once
&gt; 
&gt; How big of an issue is this ? and how would I adjust
&gt; it ?

in the .010 auto tranny (75-79) it is not that big a deal. but it does
help to get it adjusted right. 

follow the steps in the Bentley manual section 7 pg 44-45 job 13.2.  it is
very sensitive so you will probably have to really fiddle to get it right
on.
