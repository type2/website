Subject: 71 Westy for sale CHEAP Albany, NY

OK here it is one more time 71 Westy no motor but have most parts for it 
excluding block, jugs, pistons and a bit of tin. Tranny is fine, steering is 
strong, stops. All original interior, small tare in couch, have curtains, stool, 
screens, sink etc. Body is rusty but sliding door still works. 
    I have too many vehicles and not enough room and most of my interests are 
in motorcycles. I would certainly consider a trade for motocross motorcycle, 
roof rack w/attachments for my 86 Syncro...

The Price $275 firm. I do not want to part it. It is a possible restoration 
project, but better for parts or slap a motor in and get some more years out of 
it
