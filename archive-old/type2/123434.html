Subject: Engine Issues

Greetings,

'79 2.0L FI

So here's the deal. About 6 weeks ago I dropped the engine out of my '79 for 
my '78 project. Last night I finally got to the point of turning the key and 
firing the engine. It ran fine when I pulled it and had great compression. 
Now it is making a hell of a racket, is not very smooth, and is putting out 
a fair amount of white-ish smoke. I am a bit stumped. Last night I only ran 
it twice and only for a few minutes each time. All the FI stuff was moved 
over from the 79 as well, along with the dash, fusebox and about a million 
other things

Here is what I did to the engine while it was out:

Replaced cluch/pilot bearing/pressure plate/throwout bearing
Replaced pushrod tube seals
Replaced front main/crank oil seal
replaced injector seals
replaced the thick intake manifold gaskets and boots
new spark plugs
new exhaust gaskets
Cleaned everything as best I could
Cleaned and painted tin and fan housing
new fuel lines
new breather lines
new vacuum lines

I did not take the heads off. All valve stems were even when I had the 
rocker assemblies off and everything looked to be in good shape when I 
looked down the intake on the heads. My racket (noise) seems to be internal 
and not exhaust. I felt no exhaust leaks.

Could this be bled down lifters? Or do I just need to let it run longer? 
When I did the pushrod tube seals I put everything (like the pushrods) back 
in their same place. I did not (yet) readjust the valves. I also have not 
(yet) timed the engine but it shouldn't be that off since I took the dist. 
off with the bracket.

Still none of this explains the smoke.

Any ideas?????

Thanks,
Brandt
