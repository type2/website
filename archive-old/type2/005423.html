Hello All,
    I'm looking for a good used tranny (three rib) to put in my '70 Sportsmobile.  I've been able to locate one in Oshkosh, WI, but I'm in NE Ohio.  The cost of shipping something so heavy isn't too feasible for me.  I travel to most all the shows in the area, MI, PA, OH, etc.  Maybe if you have one we could hook up at a show?  All the local shops won't sell me a used one, just a rebuilt unit with a rebuilt price tag.  As far as junkyards...  Finding a bus in a junkyard around here is next to impossible and if you do find one, some Buggy guy already got to the tranny.  Let me know if you can help.

Thanks a lot,
Aaron Badertscher 
Orrville, Ohio

'65 Karmann Ghia
'70 Sportsmobile   &quot;The Flaming Turd&quot;
'74 Westfalia   &quot;Sweet Pickle&quot;
