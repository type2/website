&gt; I would need to see fact based reports on that...all I have heard about
&gt; those types of products is near urban legend status from doing numerous
&gt; internet searches...I am sure applying armor-all to your dash or vinyl top
&gt; on a weekly basis is liable to do more damage via UV rays then say applying
&gt; it once or twice a year. I think maybe we are talking a case of over
&gt; use/abuse of the product. If you are going to apply it that liberally and as
&gt; often it would be good to switch to something with UV protection like 303
&gt; Aerospace Protectant.

Actually, I think its the other way around. If you use it religiously it will
probably keep a good seal. But, when you stop using it and it starts to break down it
will eventually cause cracking. One of the reasons vinyl tops have lost their
popularity in recent years is probably because so many were destroyed by ignorant
owners and once they go bad they look horrible. There are probably some good products
on the market now but as long as people continue to misuse Armor All there will
always be urban legends so I always err on the side of caution. Soap and water and
talcum powder for vinyl and rubber.
