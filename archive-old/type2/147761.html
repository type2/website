Subject: Window-unit A/C install... Anyone got pics?

I'm in the process of designing a (removable) window-unit a/c mount
for my '79 Westy, for use while camping. My plan is to fabricate a
mounting system for the passenger-side front window, but I'm trying to
makee surre it goes in and out as easily as possible, and I don't want
to have to make any physical mods to the bus. It seems to me I've seen
a pic or two of this sort of thing over the years, have any of you
tried this? Has anyone posted a procedure or materials list anywhere?
I'm planning on documenting the &quot;build up&quot; and install, so at the very
least the info will be available in the future. Any help or advice
would be much appreciated. Thanks-

JJ
