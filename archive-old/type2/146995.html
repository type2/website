Subject: Qu re hot start fix in FI busses

: (forgot to cc list)
Daughter's 75 started the &quot;sticky solenoid when hot&quot; problem on our long
haul to Savannah from NJ.  Ran fine at 23 mpg, 65 mph all the way to
keep oil temp around 240, never over 250.  Zip start at a gas stop and
had to lie under her bus and run a wire from batt. terminal (30?) to the
upper solenoid spade to kick it.  Cleaned connections, (using a 12v
dremyl designed for chainsaw charpening but, but put in a tiny rotary
rasp that cleans right inside a spade) but it did it one more time, so
in Savannah we went to the WalMart and got a minitorch, solder, 6g
wire-8ft roll, connectors, and a starter push button switch.  I've put a
relay in our camper, but decided to put in an engine compartment sw to
be able to do compression checks and make it easy for her to check for
spark (has Pertronics) if she has a problem alone.  The 6g wire pushed
easily through the same grommet as the Batt. wire, and I used the
minitorch to tee it into the red/black wire from the ignition.  The far
side of the switch goes withing the screw terminal of the cam action
connection on the positive.  Starts like a charm, but she is a bit
scared to push the throttle way back there if needed.  Too noisy- guess
we need earplugs in her bus?!
   The qu relates to the fuel pump- If one puts the ign on, but don't go
to start, I assume using the bypass sw. does the same thing as the
&quot;start&quot; position on the ign sw - does this also turn on the fuel pump,
or is it the vacuum of the cylinders (deflecting the AFM) that turns on
the pump?  I notice a smaller wire is connected to the same upper spade-
is this for the fuel pump or does it flip the double relay to turn on
the pump?  (Karl said latter).  Also what is supposed to go on the lower 
spade of the
solenoid? There is nothing there.
