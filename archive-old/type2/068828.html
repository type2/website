Subject: Re: driving on snow/ice?

I live the Central Okanagan here in Canada. The Snow warning has been in
effect all week and we have had lots of buildup lately. Roads are in bad
shape and we have lots of hills.

1) I have a good set of all season radials which have a lot of tread.. They
track nicely and with the rear engine weight 

2) My bus seems to drive well in snow.. I don't have much problems in
controlling the bus.. stopping is another matter

3) Stopping... I never like to use the brakes much in snow...but prefer to
gradually come to halt.. the standard transmission works wonders... as it
can back the engine down and slow the bus down without having to use the
brakes. Don't brake in corners... brake before the corner.. and take the
corner in gear... I like 2nd. The rolling friction will help your bus stay put!


4) Slow &amp; Easy is a general motto... allow yourself lots of stopping
distance... When I park my bus for long periods of time I put cardboard over
the windshield to protect from snow...ice-buildup.. it is easy to just whip
the cardboard and shake the snow off.. I always carry a good snowbrush in my
closet as well...to dust off the sides...

5) Carry the right size chains... there may be times in deep snow that
regular tries just can't handle it... I always carry a pair of chains for
the uphill battles should I find myself unable to climb climb climb!!! I
like the cable type that easily attach on the wheel.. it is best to fit the
chains before the snow hits so you know how to put them on right and check
the fit...


6) Extra blankets... camp stove with fuel and campbell's soup rations are
always on board...should I find myself snowed in... That is a big plus to
the Westy... if you find yourself stuck in boony land...you can survive
until help arrives... or until the weather calms down... (Who wants to hike
in blizzard conditions? best to wait the storm out...especially at night.. !
:&gt;) (I keep an ice-mantle sleeping bag on board that has a space-blanket
material woven inside...it was made for heavy duty mountaineering and is
very warm even in arctic temperatures). To keep the face from
frostbite...always have a full wool mask..available. That's about all I can
say.. I have done extensive winter camping up in the mountains around
here... so I prep my van with mountain quality camp gear in case of
emergancies.. (The little linen shelf is packed full).
