Subject: 68 Baywindow Braking News

Howdy again folks,

  Once again, thank you for all the input.  You all are very kind to take
the time to help out.

  Yesterday I &quot;adjusted&quot; the brakes, bled them, and went for a test drive.
 I had to rebleed cause I took another &quot;actuator&quot; off for inspection. 
Anyhow, she started out pulling to the right rather hard.  I tried
braking hard a couple of times, aside from the pull, the general feeling
is mush.  Ho hum.

  The pull went away after a short time and it is stopping dead on.  I got
out several times to see if the wheels were heating up.  The one that
pulled was warmer than the others, but not hot.  Since I am getting
paranoid I'll pull it again today to see if anything is awry.

  Bad news is that some of the adjusting stars clips are screwed up.  I
suspect they are de-adjusting themselves.   Aarrrg.

  And hey!  The fuel guage stopped working...

Here we go again Jennifer
