&gt; Without a guage, if your pressure is bleeding off, the bus should have to crank

&gt; long start in the mornings, then immediate startup the rest of the day.  I'm going
&gt; to try a couple of ways to isolate and identify the offending part.

I'm not that familiar with the L-Jetronic stuff, but every other FI I
have worked on had a fuel pressure regulator.  It's basically a spring
loaded diaphram just down stream of the fuel pump which maintains fuel
pressure to the injectors with the fuel pump off.  One test for this
part is to turn the key to on and allow the fuel pump to build pressure
for a few seconds prior to engaging the starter.

good Luck.
