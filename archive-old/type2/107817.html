Subject: RE: Where do you keep your fire extinguisher?

I keep mine behind the passenger seat of my '71 type 2. It is very easy to
rotate the seat back forward to gain access compared to the drivers side which
needs to be slid forward on the tracks. I don't know how big a 5 lb unit is
but by putting the passenger seat in the most forward of the 2 positions may
allow it to fit.
