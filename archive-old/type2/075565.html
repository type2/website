Flame suit on!!!!!!!!!

First let me say the David Shcwarze is a lot smarter than I am. 
Having said that I am not so sure about the synthetic oil. Ric is not 
running a full flow system on his type 1 motor. I was under the urban 
myth impression that synthetic oil is not recommended for unfiltered 
oiling systems.

Secondly, among the interesting things Gene Berg had to say was that 
synthetic oil is not good for your type1 motor. The GB reasoning goes 
like this, synthetic oil does not absorb heat the way dino juice 
does. When oil flows back from the heads it has a cool reading 
because it did not absorb the heat from the head area. You end up 
with a favorable oil temp and corresponding pressure but your heads 
are running hot.

Retarding the timing a degree or two will help with head temps and 
thusly oil temps. That may increase your oil pressure a bit.
