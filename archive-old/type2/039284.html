&gt; Any guesses appreciated.  Trying to decide if I want to tackle this one.
well, my bus had most of that damage.  Fewer dents, but more rust in teh
rockers.

I have yet to fix any of it really, and have enjoyed the bus and driven it
a LOT.

so, what do you really want out of a bus... Bodywork if you dont do it
yourself is expensive.  If you enjoy that sort of thing a dented bus is a
challenge, and fun.  But if you dont like bodywork it will be a chore.

If you like the bus and if feels right, tackle it as time allows.  If you
just dont like it, wait and a better one will come along eventually
(patience grasshopper, hehe)

take care,
