still trying to figure out how to get a CO2 extinguisher in my bus but
they are getting pretty hard to find...would like to have a engine
compartment smother system but they are $$$$

nice thing about CO2 is they don't make much mess, the dry chem ones are a
real piece of work to clean up after..

dry chem mounted behind drivers seat where it can be reached from outside
