Hola,

I put in an order with Raby's aircooled technology because they had the =
new
bug me video's cheaper,
and offered them up to this list some time ago. I was told they would =
ship
in 3 weeks or so, and haven't heard back from them or received any =
replies
to email sent thus far.
I will attempt contact via telephone when I get the time...

did anyone else purchase this item from them? If so, did you get yours?

thanks!
