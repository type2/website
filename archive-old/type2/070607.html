Subject: Type III motor in a 76 bus?

Roy has gone and done it again. He rescued a 1976 westy from the 
Mountains of North Carolina today. The camper is almost all there. He 
even got the stove to work :) The bus came with a motor and as usual 
it was in the cargo bay instead of the engine room. Upon inspection 
the motor is a type III 1600 with a single carb with the funkiest oil 
bath air cleaner setup I have seen. The original plan was to part the 
bus out but there is now discussion of putting a new nose and rear 
corner on the beast and drive it as a beater for now.

An autopsy has yet to be performed on the motor bus assuming it runs 
has anyone ever put a type III in a late model bus? Performance wise 
it should hold its own against an upright but are there any other 
considerations regarding fabbing tin and a hanger bar?
