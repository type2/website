&lt;You ordered on the 1-800 order line.&gt;

Not to beat dead horse, but I placed my order in person at your counter. I
also sent an email last week and was told that my order could not be looked
up to see if had been shipped. That's why I called a day or two later.

I didn't mean to stir up a hornets nest here and I apologize if I caused any
harm to you or agitated anyone on the List. But from the replies that I
recieved, there are obviously quite a few others who felt the same way that
I did.

&gt; &gt; I am very displeased with the Bus Depot's slow service.  I placed an
order
&gt; &gt; a week and a half ago for a bunch of parts (mostly sheet metal) for my
'73
&gt; &gt; Westy. After not hearing anything for about a week, I called them and
was
&gt; &gt; told that I might see my stuff by the end of next week.
&gt;
&gt; To repeat what I state in EVERY part of my advertising - website, catalog,
&gt; etc. - please allow 7-10 working days for delivery. You cannot look up my
&gt; parts, prices, or order number anywhere that does not also specify that
&gt; timeframe.  If you get your order at the end of next week, it will have
been
&gt; almost exactly that timeframe.
&gt;
&gt; We do not always take the full 7-10. Usually we take less time. Sometimes
&gt; more. (Sometimes a lot more, if a part is backordered and there is only
one
&gt; supplier.  Unfortunately this is all too commonplace with old VW parts,
like
&gt; it or not.)
&gt;
&gt; Expedited service (even overnight) is almost always available.  If you
have
&gt; a deadline, you are best off taking advantage of that feature.  If you are
&gt; in an absolute rush and cannot afford to take any chances at all, go to
the
&gt; local VW dealer or FLAPS where you can walk out with the part in-hand;
that
&gt; way you won't even have to risk UPS delaying your part.
&gt;
&gt; You ordered on the 1-800 order line. This line is manned by an operator
who
&gt; is qualified to do absolutely nothing but take your order by part number.
&gt; She has no say as to when your order will ship. She indeed took your order
&gt; exactly as you placed it - via standard delivery. This means approximately
&gt; 7-10 working days.  If you needed it sooner, all you had to do was order
&gt; expedited delivery.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I dialed their toll-free number, and then had to call back on their
&gt; customer service # on my dime.
&gt;
&gt; That is correct.  The operators who answer my toll-free number can do
&gt; absolutely NOTHING but take orders by part number.  They cannot look up
&gt; existing orders, provide part numbers or info, or promise any delivery
&gt; timeframe other than what is in our catalog/website. This is a &quot;self
&gt; service&quot; order number was set up for the convenience of my customers who
do
&gt; the legwork themselves and know EXACTLY what they need. If you need
anything
&gt; beyond that whatsoever, you do indeed have to call the toll number.  This,
&gt; too, is explicitly stated in every single ad I run.  If you try to ask the
&gt; operator questions about your order, you will not get an experienced
answer.
&gt; It's like asking the receptionist at a doctor's office to diagnose your
&gt; illness.
&gt;
&gt; I've said this before on the list, and I'll say it again.  I am a price
&gt; oriented vendor. II give you the best possible prices on the best possible
&gt; quality. That is what I do well.  You don't get Bloomingdales service at
&gt; Sams Club.  Similarly, you will not get VW Dealer service from The Bus
&gt; Depot.  But you will get comparable quality for a much cheaper price.  In
&gt; fact, as a rule you will pay less than pretty much any vendor out there,
&gt; &quot;apples for apples.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I had a customer on the phone today who griped that he had to pay for the
&gt; toll call to find out where his order was.  (It arrived today, on the 9th
&gt; business day.)  I asked him how much he was paying for the call; he said a
&gt; few dollars.  I asked him how much he saved on the parts compared to the
&gt; next cheapest vendor he'd found.  He paused, admitted that he had saved
&gt; about thirty dollars, and stopped complaining about the couple of bucks
he'd
&gt; paid for the call.  Incidentally, he could have gotten the part via
&gt; overnight air, and even after paying for overnight shipping still saved
$15
&gt; compared to the next cheapest vendor.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; During the last 2 weeks, all h*ll has broken loose at The Bus Depot. We
&gt; installed new, expensive software which, after 6 months in development and
&gt; testing, spent the first week crashing our computers about once an hour
all
&gt; day long. It has been an absolute nightmare.  The result is that we are
very
&gt; definately at the top end of the 7-10 working day delivery range right
now.
&gt; I am doing my best to remedy this.  We are upgrading some orders to
&gt; 3-day-air and Priority Mail at no additional charge. We are reducing
&gt; shipping charges on some orders by way of compensation, and offering some
&gt; people partial shipping credits toward their next order. I even brought in
a
&gt; couple of temps to help out, at an hourly rate that makes me shudder.
&gt;
&gt; The good news is, it looks like the bugs are finally worked out. This
means
&gt; that once we catch up again (in about a week) we will have big
improvements.
&gt; We will be able to process orders much faster, which should decrease both
&gt; delivery times and the amount of time you spend on hold when you call.  We
&gt; will finally be able to partially charge an order, meaning that
backordered
&gt; items will not be charged until they ship (a change which is long overdue
&gt; but was not supported by our old software).  Website orders will directly
&gt; download to our shop rather than being processed offsite first, which will
&gt; increase response time and decrease error potential.  The website product
&gt; database will also update automatically, about once a week.  All in all,
it
&gt; will make for much better customer service from now on. But it did hurt us
&gt; during this two week transition period.
&gt;
&gt; If you have not received your order within the 7-10 working day timeframe,
&gt; please do email or call Customer Service and we'll do everything we can to
&gt; remedy the situation.
