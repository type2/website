Subject: That little &quot;D&quot; shaped shim on the alternator shaft...

First off, thanks for all the advice on my first brake job. Replaced my 
stripped drum and put on some new shoes and hardware -- goes and stops now, 
just the way she's supposed to.

Anyways, I've got a situtation now with my alternator pulley. No matter what 
I do, the pulley ends up riding against the alternator housing and has cut a 
nice deep circular gash into it. The little &quot;D&quot; shaped shim is still in the 
groove on the shaft, but it seems to have worn down a bit since I last 
looked. Anybody know where to find a replacement or have a home-grown fix 
for this? I've looked everywhere online and haven't found one yet.

Thanks...

Sean,
