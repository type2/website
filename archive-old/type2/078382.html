Subject: Missing Timing Numbers

Got a quick question about timing. By the way, my
engine is coming together wonderfully and I have all
of you to thank for much of it. So here is my
question.

 The '73 transporter that I've just rebuilt had almost
all the numbers completely rubbed off on the timing
gauge. I can sort of see a &quot;16&quot; on the right hand side
and the line that goes with it. I quess I could
measure from that mark if I knew how far apart each
one of the marks was but I don't. But if any part of
my measuring is off it would get consecutively worse
as I went down the line. Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Chris
