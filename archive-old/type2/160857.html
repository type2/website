Subject: Re: [T2] alignment/steering system hell

Hi,

That's a pretty good description though the first two steps are a bit
confusing. I think I'll let the alignment place off the hook on the
centering process - just have them set the camber and toe. Then I plan
to set the centering myself by the following process:

Find a nice flat spot of unused pavement.
Get the bus running perfectly straight.
Chalk or otherwise mark the steering wheel and column to get a mark on
the striaght-on position.(this way I don't have to eye-ball it as
Richard desribes)
Go home.
Set the steering wheel alignment mark to the straight-on position (set
the wheels perfectly straight)
Disconnect the front end of the drag link (I envision this to be the
most difficult part of the process)
Center the steering box (count the number of turn between all the way
right and all the way left, turn back exactly half-way)
Adjust drag link until it drops into the pitman arm.
Then, depending where it ends up, I'll pull the steering wheel off and
reposition to my liking (I like the spokes at about the 10, and 4
position allows me to read the speedo and oil pressure simultaneously,
the OP guage being just to the left of my steering column)


&gt; After the tie-rods are adjusted to set the proper toe at the wheels,
&gt; jack up the front wheels and turn the steering wheel all the way left,
&gt; then counting rotations, all the way right. Then go back half of what
&gt; you counted and this should center the road wheels.

This is confusing. Wouldn't this center the steering box but not
necessarily the road wheels?

&gt;
&gt; Disconnect the drag link from the steering box pitman arm and recenter
&gt; the steering wheel (all the way left, then halfway right just as
&gt; before).
&gt;
&gt; Now that the steering box is centered you can adjust the drag link at
&gt; the pitman arm to fit. All done.
&gt;
&gt; If the steering wheel isn't perfectly straight you can now (and only
&gt; now) pull it off the column and adjust it. You will see two lines
&gt; marked on the wheel and the column to show where the factory thought
&gt; the parts should have been aligned.

&gt; I think I described this incorrecly.
&gt;
&gt; To get the road wheels straight ahead you need to eyeball it and
&gt; remember what position to steering wheel likes to reside. Afterwards
&gt; you can disconnect the draglink and center the steering box with the
&gt; steering wheel.

I guess that does clarify things a bit. Still I'd rather get the
wheels straight by a verified method, not simply by eye-balling it.

peace
