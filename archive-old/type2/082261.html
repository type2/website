Subject: oil dripping in Vanagon...from where?

Like a mystery in the Twilight zone...
My vanagon has oil coming from somewhere but as of yet I haven't a clue! 
After cleaning the engine the only place I can see any type of oil is the 
spot where the plastic &quot;fake&quot; oil filler tower is (generator stand area on a 
type 1). Yet, the entire engine carrier is soaked. Any other ideas? Man, do I 
need a lift!!
