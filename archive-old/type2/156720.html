Subject: AridZona

Tell you what.  All I have been doing is relaying info about AridZona Bus
Stuff.  Many times I have been asked to check out the Bus as it is somewhere
in AridZona.  I do all of this for free! I have put many buyers and sellers
together. If this is such a burden the  two Bus lists, then no problem.
What happens in AridZona will now stay in AridZona.

&gt; Not to stir up the pot here, but doesn't this really fall into the 

&gt; category of the ebay ad thread from a week or two ago?  Don't most of 

&gt; us read TS already?  No offense to the Aridzona folks, but do we 

&gt; really need to see links to every bus that comes out of the state?  

&gt; And now links to polls on TS on where to end the VW cruise in
Scottsdale....

&gt; 

&gt; /me puts on his flame retardant garb...

 

The difference is that pointers to event announcements are not susceptable
to abuse like pointers to auctions.

 

As you know, some auction sellers

try to rustle up bids as much as they can by widely publicizing their
auction through posting repeated announcements.  It would be nice to have a
policy of moderation for this, but trying to explain moderation to some
auction sellers is impossible.  The solution was to simply ban all auction
pointers.
