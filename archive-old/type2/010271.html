Morgantown PA VW show.  Sunday, Oct 10, 1999.  I'm gonna try to sell some of 
my prize possession with a vendor's space.  Anybody else interested, being 
that Monday is a holiday, and this is very close to the Reading outlets, and 
it will be Autumn in Pennsylvania, and there is State Camping (with boating 
and fishing and hot showers) less than 10 miles away.  Anyway, I will 
bring::

Front Axle Beam, with torsion arms, with good ball joints already in.  A-1 
condition. A real find!!

Complete faux wood paneling (all -8- side pieces) from my '78 Westy, A-1 
condition  (I refinished some real wood, and replaced all)

Espar BN4 gas heater - More than complete, with pictures.

Waste Basket (blue plaid) from '74 Westy, with plastic pail and lid, A-1

'76 - 81 Auto Trans Bosch starter/solenoid, A-1 (A-1 = 'like new')
     ((I still need '76 - 81 Manual Trans starter/solenoid))

Ball joints (4) - NEW (not 'A-1', actually new)

Heater Control Boxes (2) - NEW

Lots of glass.  One slider with screen!!  Two sliders - plain.

Various fabric pieces and curtains and panels

Clocks (3) - Early Bay, Late bay, and Early Vanagon - Working

The above is all precious - I will also bring other junk / treasures

See you there??  Barry B sends.
