Elonrod,

A short block is an engine, either new or rebuilt, always with no cylinder
head(s) and sometimes without oil pump, water pump, oil pan, etc., as
applicable.

A long block is a complete engine with heads et al.

Good Luck.

&gt; For those who remember my disaster last week and the subsequent firestorm I

&gt; on which way to turn. The details of the problems with the other engine will
&gt; remain between the mechanic, the seller, and me, but here's the deal.
&gt; Option 1. Rebuild existing 1600 upright- estimate $1572.00
&gt; Option 2. Buy already rebuilt 1600 (I think he called it a short block, so
&gt; would someone explain why its called that?) for  $1760.00
&gt; Option 3. Install brand new (long block?) for $1650.00
&gt; My questions are:
