I've had this problem when I left mine standing for a while.

1. You need a LOT of battery power, you're gonna be cranking for a long time
2. I believe petrol goes 'flat' after a time, say 6 months or so? Perhaps you
should drain the tank and put in, say, a gallon of fresh fuel?
3. I dunno exactly the details, but I think you can set the timing to make
starting easier - this is from knowing that sometimes when you 'guesstimate'
the timing, you can achieve a situation where the thing runs well, but is
very hard to start!!! Other listees - maybe you know which way, retard or
advance?
4. If its at any slope at all, you may have oil in the bores. If I leave
mine a week, the first minute is very smoky from the exhaust. Maybe that
is another factor against you?
5. I find that a liberal spraying of WD-40 is necessary on the HT leads after
a while also.

Hope it helps!!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Ramona's been dormant for 6 months and counting now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;She will crank and crank, and sometimes even turn over for a teaser of a
second (I gave her a new battery too...), but then sputter and die again. She
has about a quarter tank of gas, and I'd think that should be enough. I even
tried pouring half a shot glass straight into the mouth of the carb; crank,
burp, and nothing again.
  I have spark! What's amiss?? Muir is telling me I am down to the fuel pump
and the carb. From sitting so long, is there something else that could need
attention?
