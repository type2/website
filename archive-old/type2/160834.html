Subject: Re: [T2] When vandals strike

All I can say is wow! Bus people are amazing. And I've said it before,
the people on this list ROCK!

I've already got three offers for glass from list members.

I'm trying to make arrangements with the first person who made an
offer, if that falls through I will try to take up another offer.

Mike I'd love to go to Westies in the Woods in NJ but I've already
made other camping plans up in Vermont this weekend. Wish I had know
about it ealier. Hopefully I'll get the new glass installed beofre
this weekend but hey you never know, plans change.

Time to go grab 'ol Bently and see what I'm in for.

peace
