Subject: Re: [T2] Best wire size

In a message dated 2/10/05 9:14:11 AM, tedebare_at_one_dot_net writes:

&lt;&lt; Hi Volks- I am running a separate circuit for my accessories and need to
know the best size and type of wire to run from the back of the bus forward.
The last wire I used turned out to be REALLY cheap wire, was very stiff, and
very hard to run to the front. Can anyone suggest a more flexible type of
wire and gauge? TIA Ted
 &gt;&gt;

If nothing else, make sure it's braided wire, not single strand no matter
what the gauge...Much more flexible... ;-)
