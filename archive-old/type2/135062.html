Subject: RE: [T2] fan shim, muffler q's and 1st engine drop 

&gt; everyone seems to say these rust out in 2 years 
&gt; regardless of which one you buy. Is that really true? Is a 
&gt; bugpack muffler going to rust to dust as quickly as an EMPI? 
&gt; Is either one better than the other or worth the extra price?


The OE setup will dramatically outlast any of the extractor systems and is
well worth the price difference.
