&gt; i've isolated the highbeam dimmer relay with help from Tommy at VW
&gt; Restorations USA. in my bus it's part number 321 941 583. however,
&gt; i'm being told by more than three sources now to use 111 941 583.
&gt;
&gt; the thing that has me a little confused/worried is that all of the
&gt; catalogs i've seen on the web list 111 941 583 as a '68-69 part, not
&gt; a 1971.

Up to vin # 219 300 000 [end of 69] the relay is 111 941 583
From vin # 211 2000 001 [start of 71] the relay is 411 941 583C
What did 70 use??
I have an extra 71 fuse box [B] and the right most relay is the high/low
relay. The middle one is turn signals. I have the relay in my hand and there
is no VW part number on it. Siemons did not feel like putting one on it? It
does have 12v max 2 x 150W and it is 5 pin.
