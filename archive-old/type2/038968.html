Subject: wacky cylinder in a 1600

Hey all, I just came in to a 1600 (actually 1650) motor and I have a
question.  There seems to be a dead cylinder (#2) but I'm not sure why.  It
has compression (125 lbs) and spark, but when I pull the plug wire off when
the engine is running nothing happens (i.e. it does not run worse, like it
should)  I adjusted the valves and the exaust was a little loose but nothing
spectacular.  The fact that I was able to adjust the valves properly
suggests there is nothing funny going on with the cam.  Maybe I am just
imagining things.  I haven't revved the engine while the plug wire is off so
maybe it is running worse and I just haven't been able to notice at idle.
Any suggestions or other ways to test a cylinder?  Thanks
