My 73 has its spare on the front on a plate that is sheet metal scewed =
through the front panel.  It is secure and easy to get at but when I =
took it all apart the spots where the tire cover was rubbing had chaffed =
the paint off right down to the metal.  When I put it back together I =
left the cover off so it wouldn't rub anywhere.  It seems fine =
considering it has been there for 24 years

Subject:        front wheel carrier 75 Westy

I am looking for a good way to store my spare tire, not that the under =
the
sink method isn't pure genius, but I saw the picture of the caravan at
ftp://ftp.ari_dot_net/users/dworkin and the picture of the 75 (pat*****)with =
the
tire on the front inspired me.  I also read the rookie mistake bit on =
the
list that touted front wheel carriers as a mistake.  Now... Is there a =
way to
attach the wheel carrier to the bumper, as it looks like has been done =
on the
pictured 75, or does one have to drill 6 holes in the front of the bus =
and
mount it like the guy at our local vw place told me to?  Just trying not =
to
bugger up the bus.  Oh.. if there is a bumper mount, where can I get =
one?  =20
Thanks for all who help, and those who read on...
