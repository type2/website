Subject: Re: [T2] Engine install assistance please

Not necessary to remove the shifter. On bays, it is designed to pivot. And the
axles hold the trans up along with the front rubber mount.

&gt; Tom,
&gt;
&gt; What Karl suggests is SOP on the Vanagon engine removal.  I have not tried
&gt; it on a bay, but I see no reason it would not work.  One thing on the bay,
&gt; though... do remove the shift rod from the nose of the trans before you
&gt; swing the trans down!  If you don't, it will really bind on you! You also
&gt; need to support the bell housing lest it fall on the floor.  A couple 2x4s
&gt; should do it.
