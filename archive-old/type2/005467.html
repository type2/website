Subject: [T2] Lower that bus?


&gt;Hypothetically, If I wanted to lower the front of my
&gt;68 singlecab , how would I go about that?
&gt;Ive been told by some to remove several of the leaves
&gt;from the tubes in the beam. Is this safe?

This is a current and reoccuring theme over at the
vintagebus list ( www.type2_dot_com ) come on over.
