Subject: Re: Eureka Springs Show

The Eureka Springs show was great,  I recommend it to all,  lots of fun
includes a &quot;parade&quot; of VW's through the streets of this Swiss village like
town in the Ozark Mtns with the steep, narrow streeets blocked off to all but
the parade by the local police... lots of waving, cheering folks along the
route...plenty of stuff to do for families,, steam train rides, cave tours,
music shows, craft shops, camping and hiking in the mtns  etc.
