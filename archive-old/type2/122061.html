Subject: RE: [T2] fresh rebuild

&quot;This is all &quot;best practice&quot; preventive measures. Remember, VW's have been
ressurected after sitting in a field for 15 years by doing nothing more
than changing oil, adding battery, and turning key.&quot;


- true enough.  My '78 sat next to the garage for 3+ years before I took the
time to replace the alternator, charge (not replace) the battery, change oil
and turn the key.


Amazingly resilient beasties...
