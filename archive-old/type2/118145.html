Subject: trip report

never thought i'd have a trip report but i do, along with some new found
confidence in my 75. just a quick report: my wife, three children, and i
went east from eugene to the coast on 126, then north on 101 to ozette
lake. then we went east to port townsend, took a ferry through whidbey
island onto bellingham and back to port townsend. from townsend we took the
hood river bridge and ferry to edmonds, through seattle and down hwy 5 to
eugene. we spent ten days doing this and i recommend almost all of it.
aside from the interstate, we averaged 50-55 miles and hour, oftentimes
less. didn't hafta pull over but aone or two times. what a simple,
carefree, and trouble free ride.

first stop was newport. for whatever reason i find myself near newport i
stop in the rogue brewery on the bay across from the state aquarium. they
have a lot of microbrews on tap, including award winning barleywine - a must
visit. next day, a few miles before the tillamook cheese factory i found a
garage along the side of 101 that had the owner identifying and wrapping
used door seals. what a place: hardly room for walking - each step in there
was a potential avalanche. in fact, he told me of the pile of thirty to
forty intake manifolds on the ground and how they were on the wall jee-ust
a few days ago but they crashed down. what an air-cooled scene. next stop
overnight was in nehalem, namesake of the river there which seemed like a
great place for a canoe trip. mellow river worth another long look via
water craft.
saw a few splitties on 101, the last being a doublecab with jalousie
windows in back near seaside. once over the seemingly endless astoria bridge
and we were in washington.

we camped out near westport which had the small but nicely shaped surfing
waves. many surfers and some vanagons but not much else. through aberdeen
into the olympic national park we saw many great looking beaches but i was
in a hurry to
secure a first come served camping site at ozette. got one. there are only
14. we loved it - great hiking to the beach, two routes each a little over
three miles. a longer trek is possible if you catch the tides right, and it
becomes a 9
mile loop. clean lake waters and hardly a mosquito. its off the beaten path
25 miles
but the road is excellent. three days later we left for port townsend.
interesting place - a victorian seaport with nice breezes all the time.
many of the buildings near the water were built in the 1880's. small scale
hippy paradise, way fine food co-op, and quite a few bay window buses and
vanagons. by that time i needed a vacuum elbow for my aux air regulator
which led me to meet a feller who puts together high falootin 230hp engines for
vanagons. eh, not too interesting. otherwise, no vw parts for miles and
miles. btw, the links to the port townsned area airs folks seem to be dead.

at that point i patched my vacuum boot best i could with duct tape and hit
up bow wow in lynnwood, but made it nearly home on hwy 5 with an average
speed of 70 until harrisburg, ore., just 15 miles from my exit. the dreaded
hesitation re-occured. the engine cooled just twenty minutes, and without
leaving the inside of the bus i replaced the old elbow and made it home
strong. seemed like a downhill ride - four and half hours. i thought it'd
be more like six.

very excited to have a running westy again. thanks much to all who made it
possible for me to take my family on this trip. loving your bus is better
the second time around
