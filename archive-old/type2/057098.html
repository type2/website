Subject: RE: Oil leaks, Electronic Ignition, Brake Lights ..........?

&gt; I know some sump plates have a center drain plug, but mune 
&gt;does'nt.  I have to completely remove the plate to change my oil.

The information I supplied in the previous post was relevant to type IV
motors only.  The upright motors don't have the secondary sump plate
like the type IV's do.  And the type IV's only have a single (12mm?)
special nut that holds the strainer screen on.  Sorry for any confusion
here.

&gt;I am also looking at electronic ignitions, 009 distributors,  blue
coils 
&gt;etc...  Does anyone have a setup that they recommend?  My engine 
&gt;is a stock 1600DP with 34 PICT Solex.  It's in a 71 Westy, with a 
&gt;ton of vacumn hoses running about.

If at all possible, stay with the original vacuum advance distributor.
It's a LOT better setup than the 009 - especially for a stock motor
(more power, better economy).  Anyone who says different most likely
didn't have their original set up correctly in the first place.

&gt;Finally, I just bought this bus and the brake lights don't work.  I 
&gt;checked the bulbs, and looked at the fuses (was'nt sure which one 
&gt;it is).  Does anyone have any recommendations?

Check your brake master cylinder switches.  My 73 has 2 switches - don't
know about your model - may only have 1.  Have a buddy stomp hard on the
brake pedal while you crawl underneath and check for continuity through
the switch(s) mounted to the MC.

&gt;I also need front and rear bumpers for this bus.  Does anyone still 
&gt;make these?

You can find repros (I think Rocky Mountain Motorworks carries them),
but you should be able to save yourself a ton of money if you can locate
some used ones from a junk yard.  If you don't know where to look, ask
around in your area and someone can probably point you in the right
direction.
