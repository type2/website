Subject: Re: [T2] Help! Need body panel + hatch

&gt; It seems BustedBus can't help - and I need a body panel to *finish* the body work on my '78 Bus before painting.
&gt; 
&gt; Specifics: a &quot;quarter panel&quot;, rear, passenger side, including the gas filler orifice, trapezodial in shape.  There aren't any wreck Buses to my knowledge in the Augusta, GA area - so if anyone has one rusting away in the back yard, or has a lead on someone who does, *please* contact me.

Bus Depot had some new ones
