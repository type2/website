  Much thanks to George, Bob and Andy for your input. I Will need a heater (pref. stock) because winters get to be pretty cold here (40 or below). The summers another story... Average summer day here: about 110! Go figure. 
  I probably will try to utilize the original heater boxes. I talked to a VW mechanic who can check them for me. Even if I don't use the originals, I'll keep 'em as a memento. Thanks again!

Peace &amp; Harmony
