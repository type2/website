Karl,

Damn, you are good!  


Ok, I read the next post from Mark as well and got the same response from 
Autozone last time I was there.  Walked(pretty much next door) and order 
some NGK's that were cross referenced.

OK, now for the real question...for some of the folks that dabble in 
cdi and aftermarket ignitions.

Why? Do most of them insist that you use resistor type wires(which I 
detest).  If I have an electrical charge going down a &quot;conductor&quot; why 
would I want to atenuate it by using resistor type wires?  If I have a n 
ignition wire, I want it to be a real &quot;wire&quot;.

Cheers, dave

&gt;  These  are resistor plugs...I've never used them but
&gt;  I know Karl recommends  against using them.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  OK For what reason?? 
&gt;  
&gt; ------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
 VW uses the same basic Kettering ignition system as
 pre-electronic Mercedes. Both use Bosch parts. Same
 Bosch coil, same style points cap rotor. Same solid
 wires with resistor ends. The resistance of the
 ignition system is added up by the rotor resistance
 and the resistor ends. That is all that is needed. On
 Mercedes, when resistor plugs are added to the
 equation, a miss under load always developes. Too much
 resistance for the Bosch coil to overcome. Install
 standard plugs and the car runs fine again.
 
&gt; This gets thrown out the window when non-stock parts
&gt; are used.....
