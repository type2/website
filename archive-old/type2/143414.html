Subject: Help with heat needed

I have a 78 Westy and get a little heat and defrost but not much I have read
that insulating the paper tube with 4&quot; Mylar and putting in a bilge blower
in line at the front end will do much to help.  I read the long article in
the archives about heat in a bus but it spoke of putting on the insulation
behind the front fresh air grill.  I cannot visualize how I could get it
down under to the paper tube.  Could those who have insulated the tube give
me a word on how to do it.  Just looking underneath I would think I would
take the plastic muffler off to gain access to the tube.  I don't think the
insulation would push very well, but what ever works please let me know.
Also how do I install the bilge blower (how to get access to a spot where it
can be installed, and how large should it be?  

 

All advice fully appreciated

 

Thanks to all
