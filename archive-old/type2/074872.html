Subject: Re: [T2] Wanted: Bus Towbar

I would think that as long as you had enough fluid in the tranny, no harm no
foul. I've pulled 'em a long way on both bar or dolly (last one from Fresno
to Victoria) and only took it slow on the 66 in respect for the RGB. I've
never had a transaxle problem on a VW.

&gt; Rick, Mike:
&gt; Huh? I guess from the thousands of miles that I flat-towed buses, Vanagons
&gt; and Porsches (356 and 911), I'd have known about this!
&gt; I SAY that there is nothing wrong with towing a MANUAL TRANSMISSION type 2
&gt; with the axles in. NOT an automatic!

&gt; &gt; Hi Mike,
&gt; &gt; its my guess that the rule of not towing a Bus with
&gt; &gt; the drive shafts connected would hold true for a bug
&gt; &gt; b/c we have the same principles working in the tranys.
