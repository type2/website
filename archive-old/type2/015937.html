Thanks for the &quot;generally&quot; answer Harmon, but I had asked about specifics.
Do you have anything specific?  In your earlier post you mentioned that a
mechanic had showed you examples of engine failures caused by not breaking
in the engine, or at least that is what I thought you meant.  So,
SPECIFICALLY what type of problems were attributed to this?
