Subject: Rough running and backfiring on 78 FI
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi Folks,
To bring you alll up to speed, I was having some rough running 
problems on my 78 FI bus.  I recieved many good tips, but none have 
worked out. OK so I'm back working on my bus, and not getting 
anywhere.  I checked the cht, it is fine, new points, rotor, dist 
cap, air cleaner.  Now the bus won't even start, just a big back fire 
and all the hoses go shooting off the air distributor.  Any ideas on 
air distributor?  I'm getting fuel, it is clean, and it was running 
fine before all this happened, it is just very sudden.

Any hints?  I'm supposed to have this running for tomorrow....doh!
