Subject: Re: [T2] Weber 34ICT dual VS single progressive

I use both. In Canada you will need electric manifold heaters with the
progressive. See if there are any 12v heater strips at omega_dot_com . I
also like its simplicity. You can be sure all four cylinders are
getting the same mixture. ICT tends to warm up quickly because of the
short distance from carb to head.

 Hey guys.... i have some customers on a budjet.. looking for carbs (1700
 &amp;1800cc type2 bus engine).

 I have my way with the single prog. Weber... but i need feedback or
 comment on other options (icing is a problem here in Canada), the dual
 34 ICT look like a good option... remember, money IS an issue...  i see
 that those carbs doesn't have any choke.... any comments would be
 appreciated... what about those new Solex on the market???
