&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;The tent is medium blue with yellow sections. It doesn't have a floor
&gt; &gt;but it does have the piece that connects it to the bus (with the rubber
&gt; &gt;trim piece and snaps. As far as I can tell from the manual everthing is
&gt; &gt;there except for the couple poles. The tent and poles look like new.
&gt;
&gt; Does this sound like a circa 65-67 tent? to you, I am actually looking for
&gt; a earlier stlye tent the &quot;awning style&quot; that attaches to the side of the
&gt; bus (and poles to front and rear bumper). Tents are usually red and white
&gt; or yellow and grey.
&gt;
&gt; So from what little info I have provided does anyone have any thoughts what
&gt; the tent might be worth?
&gt;
Sounds indeed like a late splittie tent. It's basically the same as the late
model tents, but without a floor. Unless you are striving for perfect matching
of the accessories, I would go for a later tent, as the floor is very nice to
have.
But, if you can ever find an early tent, they are pretty cool, as you can set
up just the awning, for hanging out and such, and then at night attacch the
walls to finish up the tent.
 I have seen examples of all three of those styles, and other than for reasons
of authenticity, I'd choose the late model tent over the late split one. Of
course, if you can find an early tent, go for it! (It also requires special
bumper brackets.)
