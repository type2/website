&gt; list, for my fuel line job I did the following:

&gt; changed all fuel lines

&gt; new filter

&gt; pulled all injectors, used one new smaller seal on #3 as I lost the original
&gt; (borg-warner)
&gt; 
&gt; pulled 3/4 intake runner (had to fix sheared stud)
&gt; 
&gt; disconnect main f.i. plug (gently to get to fuel ring)
&gt; 
&gt; disconnected airbox &amp; wiring (above)
&gt; 
&gt; everything is back in it's correct place. cranks but won't start.

Not sure how many times you've cranked it so far but after I change lines
and put everything back together, I poke a screwdriver in the airbox to get
the fuel pump to prime the system.  You can hear it working. It's a long way
from the tank to the pressure regulator.

Did you forgot a connector at the heater fan.  Is the connector to the air
box pushed all the way on?
