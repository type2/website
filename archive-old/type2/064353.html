Subject: starter questions....

hey now,

today i cleaned the starter connections and sanded them a bit to get rid of
some corrosion to see if the '77 would start. no go. but i noticed a prong for
a slide on wire connection that had no wire on it. as you lie under the bus
with feet towards the back, head towards the front...it was the prong closest
to the ground. what would this be? i figure it is for grounding but i'm not
sure.
