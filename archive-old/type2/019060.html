I've had the same problem periodically for years in my '71 and I just
put in a hard start relay as part of the fix. I have not had years of
experience as a VW mechanic but I have had years of experience in
electronics and here is my take on the problem. Although wire length
does contribute, most voltage drops will occur at a dirty or oxidized
electrical connection or a defective switch. In this case if the
cumulative voltage drop between the battery and the solenoid is great
enough, the solenoid (which is nothing but a relay, itself) will not
close. I'm guessing here, but I think that when the voltage going in to
the solenoid drops below 9 volts or so, it is getting marginal.
Assuming the wire from the battery to the ignition switch is ok (this
can be checked with a voltmeter), the wire in question is the red/black
wire from the ignition switch to the solenoid. The possible problem
areas are the ignition switch itself, the multi-pin spade connector
under the dash where the red/black wire passes, and the spade connector
on the solenoid itself where the red/black wire connects. The ignition
switch could be bad but I would hold off on that as a last resort
because (at least on the '71) it is a PITA to replace. Between the 2
connectors in the path, the one on the solenoid is the most likely to
get dirty/oxidized because it is exposed to road spray when driving on
wet/salted roads. That was the case on my '71 so whenever I had the hard
start problem, the fix was usually to remove the red/black wire from the
solenoid, clean both male and female contacts with a small wire brush,
and spray the contacts with Radio Shack contact cleaner for good
measure.
But the problem would, after a long time, return so I went ahead and put
in the relay. A bad contact will cause a greater voltage drop, the
higher the current is that passes through it (is that gramatically
correct?). I think the hard start relay theory is that, in addition to
lowering the overall wire length, since the relay uses less current than
the solenoid, it would be less susceptible to a voltage drop large
enough to prevent the relay from closing, thereby providing more of a
margin. However, the relay output still goes through the spade connector
on the solenoid and, it seems to me, that this connector is still
exposed to the elements and theoretically could get dirty enough to
cause problems, although certainly less often than without a hard start
relay. Mine has not been in for very long so I can't tell what the long
term result is going to be. Maybe some other people have had theirs in
longer and have some long term results.
When installing the relay in the '71 (I used the Bosch WR 1) I was able
to put the relay in the engine compartment and the blue and black relay
wires were long enough to pass through the firewall grommet under the
voltage regulator and reach the solenoid. I just let the relay lay on
the engine compartment floor next to the grommet as there is not enough
play to allow any significant movement.
Finally, I wouldn't replace any chassis wiring unless I knew for sure
that a wire was damaged (unlikely, but not impossible).
