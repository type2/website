Subject: RE: [T2] Popping out of 4th gear at times?

Its means your synchros are worn out and your tranny needs to be rebuilt.
Linkage probs don't cause it to pop out.

I found a semi-local builder to build mine for a reasonable price. They start
to pop out on 4th and reverse typically - for mine in my 71 it was reverse.

12:36:39 -0500&gt; Subject: [T2] Popping out of 4th gear at times? &gt; &gt; This
weekend on a trip to the hill country here in Texas, when shifting to 4th&gt;
gear at the start of a mild climb, it will pop out of 4th under the load
after&gt; about 5 to seconds from shifting.&gt; &gt; On a 500 mile this weekend it did
like 5 times.&gt; &gt; 71 Westy, Stock 1600 DP, Stock transmission, 125k miles on
transmission.&gt; &gt; My question:&gt; &gt; Is this symptom typical of a transmission
problem or possible linkage?&gt; &gt; Thanks,&gt; Trey&gt; Houston&gt; &gt;
