&gt; has anyone ever heard of taking the head off of a type 4 2.0L engine and

&gt; Would it work, anyone tried it??


short answer: sure it would. But be careful.

slightly longer answer: there are some serious cavets with this. One
is valve clearance if you move the valves closer to the piston by
machining the head you could make it so close that they actually hit &amp;
that will damage a valve/piston quicker than you can say free power.
Also by doing this you will increase the compression ratio. This is
where you get your power. but be very careful. More power will equal
more heat. which can quickly kill an engine. There is also the issue
of what octane fuel to run.

take a look through the archives and also the archives over at
http://shoptalkforums_dot_com/

You just need to decide who to listen to. the high CR is great guys,
the stock is great guys, or the lower CR is great guys. :)
