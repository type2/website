&gt; Greetings all, what are the consequeces of using an ECU from a bus with
&gt; standard transmission on a bus with automatic transmission?  Will an ECU
&gt; from a 76 FI bus work with the rest of FI components from a 78 FI bus?

Actually, there are 4! different 76 ECU's.
022 906 021N  Fed manual trans
022 906 021P  Fed auto trans
022 906 021Q  Cal manual trans
022 906 021R  Cal auto trans

I have a 77 Cal Westy. I test ECU's using my bus. Other than 79 Cal ECU's
and Cal Vanagon ECU's [because of the O2 sensor], they all work fine! I have
not 'seen' any difference in the way the engine performs.
I have no clue what the 'difference' other than part # is. About the only
thing I can think of would be duration time of when the injectors are open.
This would affect a Cal bus having a catalytic convertor, maybe too rich?
But the only difference between a manual and auto engine is the decel valve,
but it is mechanical...not electronic. Idle speed is not controlled by the
ECU.
