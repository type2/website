Subject: Re: [T2] which carb to use.

True, the Dells have no chokes but they don't need them - mine start easily in 20 degree weather and idle smoothly within a few seconds.  

True, the Weber will start because of the choke but it will bog down within seconds from icing.

&gt;Unless you want it to start in upstate NY winter.
&gt;Then use the Weber, it has a choke.
&gt;Unless you want it to run correctly as designed.
&gt;Then I don't know, ( maybe the original fool injection :)
