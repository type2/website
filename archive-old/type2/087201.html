Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 questions

Larry,

In my opinion, por-15 is worth every penny.

Go back to their site and read the FAQ.  You don't have to use all 4 
items...if you sandblast or clean otherwise, or some other gotcha's.

Their site lists everything you need to know.

Basically, por-15 like something other than shiny/greasy metal....it wants 
something with &quot;tooth&quot;.  por-15 is suseptible to uv light(sunlight) so you 
need to paint over it if it is in sunlight.

A quart seems to cover more than I ever thought it would.

*Read* the warnings!  Wear a respirator.


Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi all - I've been hearing and reading a lot about this stuff called POR-15, 
&gt; and would like to get the list members' opinions on it.  Any good or bad 
&gt; comments would be welcome, I just want honest ones.  A concern for me is the 
&gt; cost.  According to the POR-15 website, you should use four steps to prepare 
&gt; and finish the surface:  (1) Marine Clean, (2) Metal Ready, (3) POR-15, and 
&gt; (4) Chassiscoat Black.  The website lists prices for a gallon of each as:  
&gt; $28.75, $28.75, $95.00, and $140.00.  Is it worth the expense?  Do you HAVE 
&gt; to use all four chemicals?  How much coverage will you get with a 
&gt; pint/quart/gallon?  Reviews of POR-15 I've seen are positive, but that's a 
&gt; lot of money for me on top of the other parts and repairs I'm getting.  
&gt; Thanks for your advice!
&gt;
