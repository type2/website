Subject: Re: [T2] scary sounds

Maybe take a different angle on what it might be, does the sound come from 
the front?

If so sounds like the issue I have with my speedo, tap tap tap tap comes and 
goes and is in rhythm with the &amp;quot;heartbeat&amp;quot; of the speedo. Clutch pusing in 
quits it. Colder air seems to make it worse.

&amp;gt;If you have to push the pedal all the way down to silence the noise,
&amp;gt;it means that it is something rotating in the transmission making the
&amp;gt;noise, but you don't want to hear that yet.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
