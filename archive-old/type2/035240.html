&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;
&gt;Actually this is not quite correct.  You _can_ buy new heads from AMC Spain.
&gt;Their reputation is that they have the same tendancy to drop valve seats (or
&gt;worse, depending on who you ask; see the archives) as the original VW ones
&gt;did.  Which makes the AVP heads (which I sell) and Marc Stephens heads an
&gt;improvement over them (for less money), since they have a newer design that
&gt;minimizes this problem.

You can also buy brand-new OEMs from Riechert Tuning in Germany.  Ask
for Axel (I think that's how you spell his name!). . .
