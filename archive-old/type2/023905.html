Please remember no matter what VW unit you choose, you will not have a
road burner...your average Aerostar will suck the headlight out of your
72..I
drove a vanagon with a 3.5 liter Rover V-8 ( I have sick,*sick*, friends...)
and even at 185 HP it was just &quot;OK&quot;......

Hi all,

Just had to reply to this one.  Almost any &quot;small&quot; V8 will fit along with
most of the subaru motors and late model 4cyl motors.  I managed to stuff a
4.4 liter all Alloy V8 (Based on the 3.5 liter Rover motor) in the back of a
75, with 200hp this thing would wheel stand in 1st gear running through a
1600 transaxle.  No longer will your average anything suck anything outta
this bus (now has about 230hp after mods and custom ratios in an 091
transaxle to keep the wheels down along with the revs)

Check out this swap along with others at my site

Cheers
