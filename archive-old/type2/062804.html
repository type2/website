Subject: Rarest of the rare Breadloaf

Coming back from BBTA I found 5 of what I have to believe 
are some of the rarest buses I have seen.

1979 Bench seat double door passenger vans (all with gas 
heaters).  The sliding doors had ventlation slits similar 
to the ones in single cab cargo doors.

Lowest mileage was 9,000, highest was 24,000  ACTUAL MILES!
He supposedly already has a buyer coming from California.

Anyone know of similar buses?

Dave
