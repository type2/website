&gt; Hi Scott:
&gt; 
&gt; No I am having a local shop do the rods. Experienced with all sorts of
&gt; engines,
&gt; but very little VW work. The problem of living in the boonies.
&gt; 
There is nothing special about vw rods, really.
&gt; 
&gt; I had thought about sending mine to be done, but I don't want to exchange the
&gt; rods

Rimco might be able to recondition YOUR rods, instead of selling you a recon
set. You can only ask.
  
&gt; Look carefully at the top left one and you will see that they have a seam.

I just spoke to my machine shop and he said all the vw bushings he sees now
have seams, and the ones in my rods did as well, my mistake. The solid
bushes are not available or marginally available. He also noted that the
aluminum color of the babitted metal disappears as soon as the bushing is
honed, revealing the bronze below.
