A few years ago I let a VW shop put new tie rod ends on my daughter's '67
Bug and they told me to take it to an alignment shop because they didn't
have the tools.  Having heard of the yardstick method I decided to try to
save myself some money.  My first attempt resulted in 2 worn out tires and
when I put new tires on and tried it again I learned something.  With the
yardstick method you can get the tires parallel to each other and still not
have them pointing straight down the road.  So now my first step in the
process is to take a long straight pipe (or 2X4) and lay it between the
front and rear tires on one side(it has to be long enough to go from the
back of the back tire to the front of the front tire).  I lay a brick down
next to the rear tire so the board is high enough to have a front and rear
contact point on the tire.  Now I set the toe in on the front tire so the
back of the tire touches the board and the front of the tire almost touches.
Then I do the yardstick thing between the 2 front tires.  There should be a
slight difference in length between the front and rear measurement with the
front being about 1/4 to 1/2 inch shorter distance.  Then I do the long bar
measurement of the front and rear tires on the other side to verify that
I've got everything right.

One other thing that makes it easier to work on is to have the front end
jacked up enough to remove most of the weight from the wheels.

&gt; You set toe for both sides at the same time.  You measure it with two
&gt; yardsticks between the rims ahead of the spindle and behind the spindle.
&gt; the difference in the two readings is the toe-in.  To get it right, you
&gt; need to roll the bus to a stop without using the brakes, then chock the
&gt; rear wheels while you make your measurements.
