hello,

in mississippi once (i think??) i talked to a guard at a rest stop, and
asked him what no overnight camping meant.  I said i was confused as waht
good is it to have a rest stop if you cant pull over and nap when you have
become an unsafe driver.

He said it was their policy that if you were there 24 hours that was
overnight camping and you would be hassled...

So, now if i have to sleep in a rest stop, i just lock all my doors, shut
all my curtains, and keep a low profile.  My bus is dented and rusty
enough that no-one would ever think that i have anything worth taking.

peas,

Steve
