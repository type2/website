Subject: Re: [T2] Can't get engine out

Troy, you don't have to remove anything from the engine (well.. maybe 
the FI stuff).  all you do is remove the tranny carrier bolts and let 
the whole assembly come down.  Then pull the engine off the tranny and 
voila.

&gt; Also, if you are lowering the engine with a jack and the emergency brake is
&gt; engaged, you should be able to pivot the engine back and forth while pulling
