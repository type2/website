Subject: RE: oil filter location on '71 bus

Brian,

I mounted my filter under the l/h rear corner
(http://www.scottandmaggie_dot_com/cooler2.html) I bolted the mount
underneath with the filter mounted so the open part is at the top. That
way I don't spill much removing it. In the picture you can also see the
thermostat that is installed down stream to route the oil back when
cold.

-Scott



&gt; How have you folks mounted it?
