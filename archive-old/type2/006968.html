Subject: reaming valve guides
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I am building an engine for my bus and the heads that I have are 1700 heads 
from a type 3.  My question is:  I need to ream the valve guides that I just 
replaced, I forgot the paper that I wrote the size of the valve stems and 
would like to obtain the reamers this weekend.  I think the exhaust valve is 
a 9mm stem and the intake valve is an 8mm stem..._dot_can anyone confirm this and 
save me a trip to find the paper?
Jim
