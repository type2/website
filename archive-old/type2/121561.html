&gt;I see a lot of people are looking for these units and related hardware.
&gt;Does this company still exist? Has anyone ( Golde or aftermarket )
&gt;considered making reproduction units? Sure seems like somebody could
&gt;fill a hole in the market, literally and figuratively, and make some
&gt;money to boot!

2 of 3 will apply gobs of RTV to fix anything before they would consider 
the cost to fix these right. You can rob cables from any Euro. Find some 
from a 944 and fabricate from there. They may be shorter, but you can have 
3/4 opening as opposed to no function. If you need repro parts, I can make 
them for you. You buy them from me and you kill the big market for them 
that you have identified.
