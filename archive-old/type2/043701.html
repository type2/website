Subject: Installing Kadron's

Hi Volks!
I am about to untake installing dual Kadron carbs on my stock 1600 DP with
Berg extractor, Jacobs ignition, and 1.25 rocker arms. The engine runs good
but I am looking for a little more &quot;cruising&quot; power. As I am not a very good
mechanic, I would appreciate any and all hints, tips, or advice before I
screw things up too badly. Also, what is the best way to remove the stock
air cleaner bracket without destroying it? As always TIA for any help!
Believe me, without this list, my bus wouldn't survive. TBear
