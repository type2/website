Subject: RE: sunroof instead of a poptop

I am in the process and it is very simple.  Sunroofs at the vw shows rage
from $100 - $300 with the rails and everything.  Easy job though.

Is it plausible to put in a sunroof to cover the camper pop top hole.  Its 
the same design but what type of work would it take to replace it with a 
sunroof?  If this is ok than does anyone on the list know where i can find a

68-79 sun roof for lets say 60 dollars?
