Subject: Re: [T2] Check this out...

&gt; Crawl under it and see if the master cylinder has four metal lines leaving it or two...
&gt;
&gt; Was the bus an import or P.O. modified?

i dont recall what year this bus was...
but 3 lines for a dual circuit, right?
one each for the fronts and for the back it  splits with a tee  between
the rear axles.
