Subject: Re: [T2] windshield tips

&gt;1 - lube the FRAME, not the RUBBER!!  I used silicone that I use to 
&gt;blacken the tires.  A silicone wipe.   Wipe your lube on the frame where 
&gt;the rubber will meet the frame .

We use so much lube on everything it doesn't matter. We reapply as we go 
along sometimes! &lt;grin&gt; I lube both.

&gt;2 - DO NOT put it in at the bottom rail, but start pulling the string at 
&gt;the bottom of the windshield. (Of course, you have to wrap the string in 
&gt;the seal so that it meets at the bottom, and overlaps some)   Reason: the 
&gt;windshield is heavy and the bottom is the more difficult area.  So  start 
&gt;there first.  Heavy windshield pulls down towards the bottom.

Once a window is in the opening I squeeze my fingers in between the seal 
and the body to center the glass in the opening.

&gt;3 - pull slowly, and watch how the rubber pulls over the lip.  DO NOT push 
&gt;on the windshield, or you will make the string to difficult to 
&gt;pull.  Don't worry about getting a perfect seating of the windshield/seal 
&gt;in the frame.
&gt;It will seat easily enough after all is done.  Just worry about getting 
&gt;the rubber over the lip of the frame.

I push upward or downward or side to side on the glass (through the rubber) 
at the edge. HOWEVER I don't push inward!!! That will break the glass on a 
bad day. I can push upward from the bottom, downward from the top, side to 
side from the sides. The string pulls the glass inward like Barry says.

I'm not moving the glass but encouraging it to move as the string pulls the 
seal into the groove. Use you own judgement here b/c I know I'm playing 
with fire. I've never broken any glass first hand. I went to help a fellow 
do some Bug glass once and he broke it removing it from the car (it was 
sitting in the window opening sans rubber). I returned for round two and he 
broke it again... &lt;sigh&gt; I never heard from him again so I'd guess he went 
to a pro glass shop. Sometimes that's cheaper!  &lt;grin&gt;

&gt;4 - Most Important!!  The windshield MUST be perfectly centered.  I was 
&gt;outside, and I could reach my hands across the windshield, and I could 
&gt;touch the right and left edges of the rubber &lt;-&gt; frame and feel with my 
&gt;finger tips when I had as centered a windshield as possible.  This is why 
&gt;I was outside, and my daughter got the no-brainer inside.  This centering 
&gt;must be maintained from start until you get both sides of the string from 
&gt;the bottom, up to the top.  Pull each end of the string from the bottom, 
&gt;somewhat evenly.

If you lube the rubber and body enough the windshield can be slid leftward 
or rightward SLIGHTLY once seated. IF YOU LUBE ENOUGH. We had this problem 
and it was evident b/c the front glass was out a bit on the driver's side 
top corner. I placed my flat open hand on the inside of the glass and on 
the outside of the glass, pushed my hands together and pulled the glass 
towards the side it needed to move. I had to wiggle the whole van as hard 
as I could to get it to move much. Prob moved it 1/8&quot;. I'm surprised the 
glass didn't break though because it wasn't seated correctly initially.

&gt;5 - If you do pull the string and the rubber does not go over the frame 
&gt;lip, STOP ! !  If there is just a small 'holiday', like a 1/4 inch or so, 
&gt;you can feed the rubber over the frame with a flat blade screw 
&gt;driver.  You can use metal if you don't touch the glass.  One minute of 
&gt;work here will keep you from restarting the whole job.

We use a plastic picnic knife. I find I typically tear the rubber with a 
metal tool. YMMV. We use lots of lube on the knife. Go slow and watch the 
rubber move over the lip. If you go fast the string may pull the rubber but 
not over the lip. Slow = 1&quot;  in 4 or 5secs. Slow and steady. Use some 
judgement here of course. Also we wrap the string around the seal twice. 
First pass pulls the rubber seal over the lip. Second pass gets any rubber 
seal that didn't get completely over the lip because the glass wasn't 
seated properly yet. I LOVE to watch the rubber pull into the groove from 
the outside. Something about that is cool. Satisfaction of a job well done 
(no broken glass &lt;grin&gt;).

A suggestion: if it is your girlfriend or wife or daughter helping you: the 
string really tears up my wife's hands because they are smaller and not as 
tough as mine. I took a piece of broomstick or large diameter wood dowel. 
Cut into 4&quot; lengths. Drill hole through them (just like if you wanted to 
hang the broomstick on the wall) and then pass the cord through the hole 
and wrap it around the dowel. Don't tie. The wrap ought to keep the string 
from sliding out, the wood gives the inside person's hands something more 
comfortable to pull with, and the lack of tying allows them to slide the 
string through the handle as they pull more and more string out of the 
seal. Gloves - something like those thin garden gloves - can be good too.

&gt;My opinion:
&gt;
&gt;Bottom line, no pressure is needed from the outside of the 
&gt;windshield.  The outside guy is just there to keep the windshield from 
&gt;falling out, and centering the windshield, and seating the windshield / 
&gt;seal when needed.
&gt;AFter finished, you can put pressure from the outside directly on the 
&gt;rubber seal, not on the glass.  I used a small piece of wood / stick to 
&gt;push on the seal, and just pushed all around the whole seal.  Carefully, 
&gt;of course...


FWIW I agree.
