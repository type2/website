Subject: More info on Beard seats

 Hello all!
 I got lots of responses about my earlier post on Beard seats so I thought
 Id post again.
 First, they do have a web-site: www.beardseats_dot_com
 Also, I am only speculating that this will be a pretty strait forward
 installation, my bus is at the restoration shop and itll be quite some
 time before Im going to be able to acually fit them in.  I will go out
 and use the old 72 to see how exactly theyll fit, but from the looks
 of the mounting hardware it doesnt seem like much more then simply 
 drilling some holes and bolting them in.

 They have a wide variety of styles and a long list of extras you can pay
 more for when you get the catalog.  These options include fabric choice,
 adjustable headrest, extra wide and estra tall construction and so on.

 When you get to the web page, just E-mail them and they l send you a
 catalog and a price sheet.  Ill keep you posted and try to answer questions
