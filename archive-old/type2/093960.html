&gt; 2)  What is suppose to be attached on the wall between the back side and
&gt; side window?  Right up there above the left side of the table.

If you look carefully at the exterior in the corresponding place you may 
see where (this is usually unstamped on all but the rarest models) the 
cast aluminum arm attached; this enabled the Catamaran feature where two 
busses could be fastened together. This was not available in the US but 
a few were imported gray-market to Canada. Traveling &quot;Cat&quot; enabled the 
use of the optional wind-sail and snorkel, and made passing beers back 
and forth much easier between busses.

You must have a right-handed &quot;Cat&quot;; for some reason the left-handed ones 
are almost unheard of. I've never seen one personally.

Regards,

-Hoop
