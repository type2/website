Subject: Re: [T2] Nitrogen Filled Tires

&gt; I believe B1 bombers and possibly other military aircraft fill their tires

The main reasons the miltary uses nitrogen are:

1. Nitrogen is dry.  Moisture isn't normally a problem, but the military
never knows what the atmospheric conditions will be when they have to
fill a tire.

2. Aircraft tires take much higher pressures than car tires, so
conventional compressors won't fill them.  Bottled nitrogen has sufficient
pressure to fill the tires.

3. Nitrogen has been used for decades to pressurize the oleo struts
on most aircraft, so they already have the stuff on hand.


Here's another little problem with the &quot;nitrogen fill&quot; business.  A
&quot;deflated&quot; tire has 15PSI of atmospheric pressure in it already.  Filling
the tire to 30PSI triples the amount of air in the tire, but that still
means that 1/3 of the gas in the tire is the original air!  To get the
tire filled with pure nitrogen means that you have to install a second
valve on the opposite side of the tire, purge the tire with many volumes
of nitrogen by letting it flow through, then close the valve and inflate.

I think I'll stick with my &quot;78% performance blend&quot;!
