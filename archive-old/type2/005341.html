And then, of course, there's the Roadcow solution.

&gt;&gt;  The secret to engineering good radiator systems is pretty much
the same as keeping your aircooled engine happy.  It has to be
supplied with a ready supply of fresh air and you have to make sure
that the air passes through it only once.  This is prettty easy if you
stick the radiator on the front of the bus, as ram air will do the job
rather well.  However, if you want a more attractive installation with
the radiator hidden you have to use more thought.  &lt;&lt;
