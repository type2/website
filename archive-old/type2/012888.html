I absolutely agree with the &quot;Buy Bosch&quot;, but from one visit to the VW
parts counter and the next I have received both the resistor rotor with
the wide blade and the non-resistor rotor with the narrow blade. I made
the assumption that I was getting the right part or an improved version.
I have also been handed spark plug wire sets with all solid core copper
wires and the set with the resistor core coil wire and spark wires of
solid core.

I have seen text page sites with the part numbers listed but did not
bookmark or save these list.

In the future I will order by part number and take the mystery out of
whether I'm getting the right part.

I asked this question because, in every situation where I've purchased
used VW Vans or Autos the previous owners have installed &quot;Get By Parts&quot;
on the ignition and often on the braking system. They wind up selling
their VW out of frustration of trying to deal with exponential problems
arising out of a series of minor non-fatal problems. The most common in
Texas is trying to get the Co down to a level (Speaking only of the 1970
cc FI) to pass the state inspection, passing the inspection in effect
dooms your engine because of detonation problems.

The two other most common visual items are the full throttle switch wired
to always on sometimes it has a jumper, and injector ground wires off or
hanging on by a few strands where they mount to the engine block.

I've been offered a nice looking 83 Westfalia (much prettier than my
solid green with white pin striping) and I'd like to do a quick
evaluation on the van before I buy it. Like all used VW air-cooled vans
It's suffering from being worked on by someone who can't or won't read
the instructions. The owner is frustrated and motivated. I don't want to
fix it for him in his driveway, I just want to be able to compile my
parts list quickly and buy right.

My county does not require the in-the-tail-pipe emissions test so I set
my FI based upon the appearance of the spark plugs after 100-mile trip.
If I get 17-19 Mpg and no detonation and nice burn color I think I'm
running about as clean as I can before starting detonation.

I'm waiting on a Bentley Manual catalog and I'll order the manual when I
see what's available to me.

Your input is always appreciated and you're usually right on with your
answers.

Thanks Again
