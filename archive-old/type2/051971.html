Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Bus Poll

I would have to call my '74 poptop Campmobile (Tigger), a B/A/C mix (hey,
don't expect a Libran to make a straight choice, eh?).

The bodywork is all original &amp; unrusted, except for a patch in the nose
about 6&quot; wide that's bogged up (clean behind so I'd say a minor parking
ding), and a scratch in the lower driver's side panels where someone backed
a trailer into it. The Paintwork, while original, is faded &amp; could do with a
respray.

Mechanicals have nearly all been rebuilt/replaced within the last 6-7 years.

The camper interior is clean &amp; tidy, but it's a &quot;lived in&quot; look ( the knocks
&amp; scrapes that you get from going away every weekend &amp; holiday in the old
girl).

&gt; hey volks,
&gt; i thought id throw a friday bus poll at everyone.
&gt; something all of you can reply to, even those lurkers
&gt; out there :)  the poll question is:
&gt; What condition is your bus in?   I am just curious as
&gt; to how many out there are driving restored beauties
&gt; down to rusty drivers.  so what kind of bus do you
&gt; drive?
&gt;
&gt; A)Restored Example
&gt;
&gt; B)Very Nice (not quite restored but very clean or
&gt; original nice condition)
&gt;
&gt; C)Daily Driver (clean but has a door ding here and
&gt; there or just a touch of rust)
&gt;
&gt; D)Beater (its rusty, dented, combo of both, people
&gt; look at you funny when they see its not abandoned-well
&gt; maybe not quite that bad:)
&gt;
&gt; reply back to me and ill try and gather the results
&gt; and post back to the list.  so even those out there
&gt; who dont post often, reply back.  ill throw in the
&gt; first vote:
&gt; 1973 Riviera- D an excellent beater example:)
&gt; happy friday
