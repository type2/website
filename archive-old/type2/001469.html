Go buy the nice bus before you change your mind. If you want a really nice
one, you will always come out ahead to go buy a mint or restored one as
opposed to buying a &quot;deal&quot; of a fixer-upper and fixing it. Parts alone are
costly. If you are worth a dollar per hour, you will be money ahead to buy
the nice westy. Time ahead to boot. And of course, you could still get some
camping in this fall before you garage it this winter.
A word of caution: there are 2 types of resto's. One is where the seller
bought the bus within the last year and fixed it up to &quot;make a buck.&quot; He
bought the cheapest parts and materials he could find and installed
everything carelessly just to have a list of &quot;new parts.&quot; The other type is
the guy who has owned the bus for years and has truly loved it. He had
planned on keeping it forever and spared no expense every time his baby
needed something. Alas, his wife left him and he must sell his soul(and bus)
for a settlement. His wife is happy about the sale and says he'd not be in
this position in the first place if he had loved HER and not that DAMN VAN
so much. He comments that she still calls it a VAN when she KNOWS it's a BUS
and this is why he is leaving...I digress badly, but the point is that a
good resto is worth a lot. A cutrate once-over is worse than a beat up
original usually. The nice bus that the owner truly can't stand to sell is a
gem. You can sort thru the BS the other guy lays down. Go have fun, and take
out your wife often in the new bus! Tell her she's better, etc.
