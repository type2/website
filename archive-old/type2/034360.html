Ken,

I was unsubscribed at the time you asked about the tranny.

I have a '76 (091) in my '69, and had KRC (in the back of Hot VW's) build
the tranny &quot;correctly&quot; for use in the '69. No cutting, etc.. need be done,
and he can tell you exactly what needs to be done to the nosecone, bell
housing, or whatever. I did not need a new starter.

One thing worth mentioning: The &quot;guide cylinder&quot; (I don't know off-hand what
it's called - it's that tubular thing supported by three bolts they started
putting on, I believe, '71 and later tranny bell housings) must match the
clutch TO bearing opening. I don't know if you can simply pull the guide
thing off if you have an earlier clutch setup. I put a new KEP in mine when
swapping the tranny.

I hope this kinda made sense, since I haven't poked my nose inside the
Clutch/Tranny/Motor myself, I had the local VW guru do it.
