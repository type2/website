&gt; I've been trying a number of our repro sliding door handles on our own bus,
&gt; and during the process, discovered that the rearward latching mechanism
&gt; needed to be adjusted.  But, about 0.5&quot; of the end of the adjusting
&gt; nut/shaft thing on part #46 (MF #075-00) was broken off.
&gt; 
&gt; There were enough threads left to adjust the latch to where I could open the
&gt; door somewhat easily, but in the process I discovered why the original VW
&gt; OEM handle shattered into a dozen pieces.  Hmm... Rocky... guess that I
&gt; don't know my own strength...
&gt; 
&gt; Any opinions on which is a better solution?  Part #28 was already broken,

I was debating about your repro handle... I use the sliding door for all
entrys into and out of the van and it is my daily driver so the sliding
door gets a lot of abuse.  the plastic handles don't last very long...so
some years ago I made one out of Aluminum bar stock, not factory looking,
left it bare metal but it has held up for 8-9 years so far...
