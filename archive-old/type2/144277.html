Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] Loose ends - Re: [T2] Diagnostic Expertise Needed

&gt; You need to find out what fried your head 
&gt; so you don't fry another one.
&gt; When there is a mechanical, ignition, FI etc 
&gt; failure any of the cylinders can go.

That's what I was trying to ask, albeit
ineloquently... Why did #2 go? What, specifically,
should I look for (mechanical, ignition, FI etc)? 

1) I see no evidence of mechanical failure (other than
the seat coming adrift) - could it just be a bad
machine-shop job - seat not fitted properly? All the
tinware is there. Fan works OK. No thermostat flaps
stuck closed. 

2) could it have been anything to do with the exhaust
leaks I used to have at the head? (now fixed)

3) Ignition system all new-ish and in good condition.
Nice fat spark at #2. 

4)Injector seems to work OK - i guess if it's
partially blocked, mixture might be lean on that
cylinder, and temp would be higher - is this
possible?? 

Thanks for any pointers you can give me. I'm keen for
this not to happen again any time soon :-)
