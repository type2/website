As far as I can see there is absolutely no objection to running a stereo etc
off the second battery while running the car.

The only thing I can think off is when a very heavy load would be connected
to the second battery while it is recharging. That would draw many amps thru
the relay possibly overloading it. In normal camper use that would never
occur. A good safeguard would be to connect  a headlight lamp (45 W) in
series with the wire from the relay to the battery. That will limit the
loading current to the second  battery to about 4 amps (or use two in
parallel if you want more). That will also prevent very high currents when
the aux battery if completely discharged.
