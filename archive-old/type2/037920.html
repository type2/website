Subject: In-line blower

Hello all,
I recently saw an inline blower fan that is mounted between the body and
the heater tube.  I know the weather is getting better, but I was
thinking about next year.  Are these things work the $60-$100?  The
process seems simple enough, but I'm questioning the effectiveness of
the device.  Any insights would be appreciated.
