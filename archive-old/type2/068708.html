Subject: heating '66

I took some steps to improve the heating of my '66.

I'd like to share what I did, and perhaps hear if I did 
anything particularly unhealthy for the car.

First off, to get the car certified, I added a 3&quot; tube 
for the center section.  I used standard housing heat duct.
I think it galvenized.  It worked pretty well down to about
0oC (32oF).  

This weekend, I added an inline blower.  I used an Atwood
3&quot; Turbo bilge blower that I purchased locally at a marine 
shop.  Marine shops are pretty good friends to VW's, I discovered.

Anyway, this radically improved air flow, far above stock.  Be
prepared to have a lot of rust fly out the vents:-)  

My concern with the in-line blower is that I'm not recirculating
the air; the air is being sucked out of the supply supposedly
cooling the cylinders.  Is this bad?  Is this bad when its really cold
out?  I don't think I'm going to like the answer to this.  I haven't
noticed any change in the oil temperature, but would I?  Its the 
head and cylinder temp that would go up?!?!

The other thing that I did this weekend was insulate the middle
tube.  I did this by buying 3&quot; duct insulation which is insulation
in a vapour barrier tub-type bad.  Around this I installed a 4&quot; 
household heat duct or the galvenized variety.  So now I have 
two tubes sandwiching insulation.  

The above coupled with a cardboard/ducttape/plexiglass partition
drove my inside temp 20oC above ambient from 0oC in a 20minute 
drive.

Total cost in CDN $
 30     3&quot; blower
  5     3&quot; heat duct (4')
  5     4&quot; heat duct (4')
  5     10' of 3&quot; heat duct insulation

Let me know soon if I'm breaking my motor with this sucking of
cooling air.
