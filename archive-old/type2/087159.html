Subject: Re: [T2] more 79 cali distributor 

Jeff,

My 78 stock fed original does not have retard on the dist.

I'm pretty sure that it is timed at about 7.5 degrees and does *not* have 
an egr.

Jeff, I think my total advance is about 40+ degrees...

Hope that helps, dave

&gt; OK more opinions requested here. To recap, 78 2L rebuilt with about 15K on
&gt; it, stock FI, 140psi comp all around. I upgraded to a 79 Calif distributor
&gt; electronic ignition setup. The coil is still the Bosch Blue but will be
&gt; replaced with a electronic ignition coil (what years Rabbit and Audi are
&gt; correct?).
&gt; 
&gt; The question is timing. My mechanic had me connect the vac advance and cap
&gt; the retard. He then timed it to 8 BTDC at idle. It runs great.
&gt; 
&gt; He said I didn't need the retard. When I pressed him on it he pointed out
&gt; that I didn't have my EGR connected and I had a 78 engine, cam and FI
&gt; brain. I shouldn't connect the retard with a setup like that since things
&gt; were different on the 79 Calif FI brain. A recent thread said that this
&gt; timing is pretty close when your not using the retard, tho I think it's a
&gt; little retarded. The correct timing with the retard vac connected is 5
&gt; ATDC. I haven't checked what my total advance is at 3600RPM, the specs say
&gt; it should be 21-25 with this distributor.
&gt; 
&gt; Opinions? I don't have all the parts for the EGR which I really should get
&gt; hooked up since it cools the engine, but is the 78 Fed engine/FI different
&gt; enough from the 79 CA engine/FI that I should NOT connect the retard
&gt; vaccuum and reset the time to correct specs?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
