One more thing to add to this topic. 

Late model Type IV's versus early model Type IV's. Mouch will swap between
them. Early models had carbs and a place for a fuel pump to bolt to the
engine case near the flywheel. The late models don't have these mounting
points. 

Late model exhaust systems got very complex (read expensive!) and exposed
more tubing to the cold air. The replacment mufflers are few. However all
models up to '78 can run the heater boxes from '72-'74 and the matching
mufflers (RMMW sells a nice one for $110 - average quality, nice sound).
For '79 you have to retro fit the heads in order to retro fit the exhaust.
I don't know how much shrouding needs swapping (if any) but save all those
odd '79 parts - some poor '79 driver needs them. 

Of course if you live in an area that might require exhaust testing soon,
consider staying OEM or at least keeping the necessary parts to retro fit
them. 

We'll all be looking for those elusive EGR valves when that time comes. (I
work for a FLAPS - hey gotta pay for school somehow - and none of our
suppliers offer the EGR valve!)

Any question I might be able to answer, feel free to write or ICQ me (the
preferred method - I have a hard time keeping up with my mail!).
