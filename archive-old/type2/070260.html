Subject: Roof rack value?

I looked at a '71 bus last night as a potential purchase but had to 
pass.

It did have one part that might be worth an offer.  There was a
roof rack that extended from the back of the bus up to about 1/2 of 
the length of the bus.  It was claimed to be original.  It looked 
similar in design (but much larger and heavier duty) to the rack a 
friend has on his squareback.  It is rusty in spots and has some worn 
wood bolted on it to make a platform.  Not bent or anything.  What is 
this thing worth?  I can just see the gas cans and spare tires bolted 
to it now.  Thanks, Jim
