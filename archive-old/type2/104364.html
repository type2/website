Subject: Re: [T2] no heater boxes? safe?

&gt;talking about a type IV engine, how is the heater box part of the cooling
&gt;system, no air gets to the heater boxes until AFTER it is finished cooling
&gt;the engine. 
&gt;  just make sure the little piece of tin under the cyl but above the push
&gt;rod tubes stays on....been running mine without heater boxes for about 6
&gt;years and I have temp guages and it is the same as it was before, no
&gt;changes
&gt;
  I personally removed the heater boxes and blocked off the fan 
discharge ports - this forces the all the air over the top of the engine 
for maximum cooling.  I used some sheet stainless, aluminum rivets and 
high temp (500+ &quot;the red stuff&quot;) silicone to do the job.  I saw some pre 
made &quot;plugs&quot; for the heater box opening in the Rocky Mountain Motor 
works catalog.  I think it was them, but after you take the boxes off 
you will see the discharge ports and making your own covers is an easy task.

Best of luck,
