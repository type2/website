Subject: I found a van!
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I finally found a van. It is a 1970. Body has no rust, but also had no engine
either.
The interior has some brand new JC Whitney seats up front that I am going to
take out. I want some original seats and recover them. I also want to find the
rear bench also. Basically redo the entire interior.  The body just needs a
spray.  Ahhh, the dreams!!!!!Got to go. Want to go stare at it some more.

Regards,
BillM
