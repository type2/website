&gt; Interesting. What do you make of it, Richard?

&gt; Oops that was destined for my inbox.
&gt;
&gt; It was too good to be true that 2004 was ending and I hadn't spammed the list yet.

Actually, I found it quite interesting, both for what it did say an for
what it DIDN'T say.

The review of the various generations of ignition control systems/heads/
pistons and bottom ends from the 60's through their current generation is
fascinating, but what is far more fascinating is that you can search that
page from beginning to end and find not a single usage of the string
&quot;914&quot;... for some reason the Posche-people just don't seem to be
constitutionally capable of admitting the existence of a car with the
Porsche badge containting actual Volkswagen parts.

I wonder what the posts will be like in twenty years relating to the
&quot;Cayenne&quot; :-)  Will a similar amnesia affict them?  Does the fear of
parking their vintage 911 next to an SUV full of kids and a &quot;soccer mom&quot;
that bears the Porsche badge so threaten them that it, too, will &quot;slip
their mind&quot;?


OOK!
