&gt; oh yeah..in the world of pollution it's called NO&quot;x&quot;...as the number of
&gt; oxygens can be..well..anything..and changing all the time..
&gt; one of them is Nitrous Oxide....(laughing gas)

That mostly sounds like what I had understood except the last point. N2O=
laughing gas, it has TWO Nitrogen atoms, and only one oxygen.  N2O likes
to burn, maybe by reacting with atmospheric oxygen or more likely by
contributing oxygen to combustion - ie as an oxidizer. I think it may also
have good anti-knock properties, but I could be mistaken about that.  N2O
is also used as a propellant for whipping cream - does anyone know why?  
It has a sweet smell, which may be why.  It also occurs to me that it may
have preservative qualities, perhaps because it is preferentially oxidized
and/or because it arrests free radicals?  Any food scientists out there?  

NOx gasses include NO2 which is a toxic pollutant which reacts with
atmospheric H2O to make HNO3 aka nitric acid, thus contributing to acid
rain.  NO2 gas is a deadly poison at very low concentrations due to
respiratory system damage subsequent to the formation of HNO3 in the
lungs.  I do not think that NOx gasses are particularly flamable, but they
might supply oxygen to support combustion of other materials?  I believe
that other NOx gasses also may do other bad things both including and
above and beyond acidifying rain, but they should not make you laugh, or
at least not due to a simple physiological mechanism...

As for the function of the EGR filter, I am still waiting for someone to
post results of a dissection.  In the mean time I'll look at some of my
literature tonight.
