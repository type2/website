Subject: Hankook Bus Tires are Back

Just a quick note that the Hankook 185R14 tires are coming back in stock
next week. This is a surprise, as Hankook had previously told me it would be
another month before I'd see them again.

These are by far the best value in an all-season tire that is suitable for
safe use on a Bus. (Passenger car tires do not meet VW specs for Bus use,
and can be dangerous due to insufficient load and inflation capacity.) They
were ranked above the much pricier Michelins in an independent test. The
problem is getting them; Hankook just doesn't stock enough of them in the
U.S. to meet demand, so they often go on backorder for months at a time.
