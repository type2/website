Subject: engine swaps
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I was telling my dad about Subaru egine swap he sugested a Mazda Rotary
Engine these engines are incredibly small(overall) and extremely
efficiant, about 1.3L and  135hp('84-'85), for a little more get up and
go there were actually some turbocharged rotaries 165hp('87) and later
182hp('89) and 200hp('90)
And becuase thes engines are so small there would be enough room in the
engine bay to fit a radiator w/ electric fan
hey maybe it would work (anybody tried this before?)
rotarys are known to have a &quot;hmmmm&quot; sound IMHO it ruins the embiance of
owning a bus, beacuse that chirp is gone
