Subject: RE: [T2] Powder Coating shops in Los Angeles

None of the high-temp paints I've ever tried have lasted more than a couple
weeks. Next time around I'm doing powdercoat on all the tin.

Does anyone have any recommendations for powder coating facilities in LA.
Turns out that rustoleum paint isn't that tough. I shot a painted part with
break cleaner and it took the paint off instantly. I figure gasoline and oil
will ultimately have the same effect. Ugh.. that was definately a waste of
time to paint all those parts.
