Subject: Re: German Vs brazilian rubber items...

interesting, I just finisished putting on four new (used) boots on the ball 
joints of our 69 today.  man that innocent little top retainer ring is a bear 
to the unexperienced.... but, I noticed, the one brazilian boot was quite 
flimsy, i ended up using the only half-way good one i had left instead. two 
others were either mexican or brazil, couldn't really tell, i can't read 
spanish or portugese, just chinese and french  hehehe but in that group of 
four used boots there was one german one and that's the one that's here to 
stay. the rubber was a lot thicker, but still pliable, the upper rim where 
that hard to put on retainer ring groove is was solid and had its own 
strength to stand up to putting the ring on. i wish we had all german boots 
on our 69.
and on a similar note, i finished puttng on ball joint boots today. the last 
hurdle in getting back on the road.... see the next note...
