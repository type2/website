Subject: Re: [T2] Glove box Question

&gt; it. My problem is I cant figure out what is supposed to hold it on the
&gt; back side of the dash. Is there supposed to be some kind of clips or
&gt; something that fell off or was removed by the P.O.?

There should be a metal strap that hooks around the back side of the glove 
box, with a screw on one end. You can probably get one real cheap at a 
junk yard. You can probably get a really cheap glove box too if you can't 
fix the tear in yours. I have also seen plastic after market ones as well.
