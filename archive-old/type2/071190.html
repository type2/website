Last friday my bus died on the way home from work luckily close to home. Sure 
enough the points burned out. So i put new points and condensor in double 
checked the gap and timed it statically. She still wouldn't fire so i checked 
the coil and it was bad. After replacing the coil checking the fuel pump and 
everything that makes that little 1600 go i was baffled. I had to do the 
inevitible and get it towed. So today now monday i stopped by the shop to 
find my bus all set and ready to go. The mechanic told me the wire running 
from my points to the condensor was grounding out on the distributor. So i 
thought o.k. no big deal i just overlooked that and this obvious easy fix and 
it shouldn't cost me to much. Think again 85 bucks! including the 50 dollar 
diagnostic charge. Next time my bus is going to sit in the driveway until i 
figure it out myself. Thanks for letting me vent. I would like to hear some 
similar stories if anybody has any.
