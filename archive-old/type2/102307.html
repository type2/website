&gt;What is the red line for the GE engine? The original rev limiting rotor
&gt;(04016) is rated for 5400pm but many of the images I've seen of tachs in VW
&gt;busses have the redline set to around 4200rpm and this is the same maximum
&gt;engine speed I manage to attain under load (in gear). In neutral I can rev a
&gt;little higher in the mid-high 4000's so I'm wondering if the rev limiting
&gt;rotor really only protects overrevs at idle.

Are you serious?  I can easily go past 5k in any gear but 4th.  Even 4th with a big enough hill.  :)  In neutral, I have not found the limit but the engine seems willing to rev to the moon.  I have dual carbs - maybe the FI engines are limited some other way.
