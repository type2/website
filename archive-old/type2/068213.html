Subject: RE: New Bus/Busses in movies

Hello all,

        I have risen above tha wannabus stauts and hve become a new owner of a '78 Valkswagen Bus 
(#2272166682). There are so many questions I want to ask, I don't know where to begin. 

        It has a 2.0L engine and I am finding it a bitch to get started in the morning. I have to 
pump the gas like a bastard to get it going. Is this typical? 

        The function of the heater levers is a mystery. Can anyone tell me what the 2 red and one 
blue levers do? 

        It has a standard transmission with an after market shift lever. I think it is called 
&quot;Scat&quot; but I am not sure. I have to lean forward to reach 1st and 3rd because the lever is so 
short. I don't know if it is shorter than the stock lever. Would it be a mistake to put an 
automatic in instead? I've owned manual transmissions for 16 of the 18 years I have been driving. I 
wouldn't mind a break from the shifting but I don't want to screw up a perfectly good standard and 
replace it with an automatic and be even less satisfied with that. 

        Water gets in through the back door and soaks the cushion. Any remedies?

        Both seats in front are in need of replacement. Any suggestions for cheapest route?

        Do all of these busses have a hard time passing emissions? 

        Aside from the fairly minor repairs it needs, it was a fun to drive it and my kids love it. 
I don't know if I can bring myself to name it, but one never knows. 

Thanks in advance,
