Subject: Re: $4000 is not enough (was major engine problems)

I agree with Mark.  This discussion is not about how cheaply you can get a
good running bus for, it was about how much it costs to make the average bus
reliable.  Like as in being comfortable in knowing everything is good to go,
not as in everything goes but may break at anytime.  Which I'd say has to do
with keeping old cars respectably on the road, not with 'the VW experience'.
Some of us pride ourselves on being able to break down and pull the engine
on the side of the road - and that's okay, as long as your wife isn't
pregnant.
