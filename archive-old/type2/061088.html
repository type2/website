Happy Holiday
My brother-in-law wants to sell his Standing Tent and the Upstairs
Cot(keeps hitting his head) from his 70 Westy.  His bus is in near
perfect condition, so I have to believe that the tent and cot are also
in good shape.
I have no idea what the items are worth.
I only know that he has no need for them.
If anyone is interested in these items send me your offer and I will
forward your information  to him for consideration.

I'm still looking for the little plastic clip that holds the table to
the wall in my 73 Westy.

Thanks for your help
