Hi guys,

Just cleaning out my desk and found a note on an interesting book.  Last
year I had laid plans out to take my wife to Alaska on a 42 day tour in
our 1976 Campmobile.  The whole trip was to be a complete surprise, just
load her in and go right after work.  No warning no hints, no nothing.
Simply a complete surprise.  Part of my reasearch prior to the trip
turned up a book called &quot;Bell's Mile by Mile&quot; which  lists all the
services, etc. available along the highways of the Yukon and Alaska.  As
I know several of you are planning a trip to Alaska in the near future,
I thought you'd like to know about it.  Here's the link to the web page
of a supplier where you can order it:
