Subject: Old Paint (longish)

Hello List,
I think I have found a donor body for my rusty 79 Westfalia. The donor is a 
77 of the same color  (&quot;monkey puke green&quot;) It sounds nice and supposedly 
has no rust, no major dents and a nice interior. And it's cheap IMO.
The issue is the paint.  From talking to the owner on the phone (400+ miles 
away) the paint sounds like it's fairly oxidized.  I was wondering if it can 
be restored without repainting it?  And how will it hold up over time? I've 
used rubbing compound with good results but the shine doesn't seem to last 
for long. I've browsed the archives and library but didn't really find 
anything about bringing old paint back to life. Maybe its not truly 
possible.  Any links, advice, or procedures would be greatly appreciated. Or 
how much would a new paint job using the better quality paints of today 
(windows out) cost?  I intend to use the bus primarily for road trips not 
shows or anything.  I just want a nice bus that won't become another rust 
bucket. Or if anyone knows of a nice Westfalia body preferably '78 or '79 
sage green anywhere close to Utah let me know.

Thanks,
Brandt
'79 Westfalia

P.S. Also does anyone have or know where I can get a cooling flap assembly 
for a 2.0 L.  The one with the two flaps, spring, shaft and clamp that the 
themostat cable connects to? Thanks!  Could trade or buy.
