Subject: I'll trade a hitch for a bumper.

I need a decent rear bumper for an 80 - ? vanagon, I need the bumper,
rubber strip, end caps.
I'll trade a class two hitch that is a factory built hitch. It mounts
between the two heady bumper mounting points and requires a 1/2&quot; notch to
be cut on the bottom side of your bumper if you want to use the hitch
with your chrome bumper.
Hitch is currently on my 83, seldom used but worked good the two times I
needed it.
