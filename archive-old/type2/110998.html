&gt;And I don't mean the dipstick behind the wheel...
&gt;
&gt;I've had a steady leak from my dipstick on the 'front' side of the engine.
&gt;This oil seemed innocuous - just kept the fan and heads getting corroding as
&gt;it was sucked into the cooling fan. But I think my recent alternator failure
&gt;could be partially attributed to this leak. The alternator cooling duct was
&gt;dripping with oil when I changed it.
&gt;
&gt;Is there something I'm missing on my dipstick?
