Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Price ??? What do you think 

I sold my '71 Westy last year for considerably more than $3K. I think it was 
worth every penny, and so did the buyer. He shopped until he found the one 
he wanted, and I waited until I found the buyer who appreciated what I had. 
I showed him the detailed maintenance records. He knew what it would cost to 
get a lesser bus into the shape mine was in, and so he recognized what mine 
was worth. Not every buyer is like that.

If the bus is very well maintained in all areas, it's probably worth $3000. 
If the body's straight and rust-free and all mechanical systems are 
excellent, and the interior's in good shape or easily restorable (especially 
if it's a Westy), than it's worth more than that. An TRULY excellent '71 
Westy, in my opinion, is worth over $5,000. A truly excellent passenger bus 
is worth close to that. It depends on many factors, including where you 
live. If he's owned it for a while and can show you the maintenance records, 
and particularly if he drools a lot and seems obsessed when he talks about 
it, it's a $3K bus, easy.
