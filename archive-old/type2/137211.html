Awesome! Thanks for the tip Phil, and welcome to the list! 73 is a great

Subject: [T2] micrometer check

 

Hello,

 

New to the list with my newly acquired '73 Westy. One of the cheapest

accurate &quot;standards&quot; for checking the accuracy of a 0-1.00&quot; Micrometer is a

Hardened Dowel Pin. A Dowel Pin is held to within about .0005&quot; in Diameter

(Note: lengths are not tightly held) and should be available at most

hardware stores. Using a combination of Dowel Pins and Feeler Gauges allows

you to verify the accuracy of a micrometer over it's full measurement range.

 

Phil

Santa Cruz, CA
