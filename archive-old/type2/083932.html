&lt;&lt; On a perhaps more selfish and distasteful note...  I'd love to hear about

someone paying that for a bus.  Seems as though it would make mine that much

more valuable... (theft for parts, insurance costs, etc. - and of course the

philosophy creeps in about what VW is all about).

Priced a completely restored Model T lately...? Other economy cars are
pegged way beyond what the original manufacturer intended, too. The
2CV comes to mind as do the &quot;bubble cars&quot; of the fifties. Luckily, some
do not cross that economic line...There must be an all original lo-miles
Gremlin out there waiting to be snapped up...:-(
