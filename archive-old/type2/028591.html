Hello all,

I've been lurking here for some time gathering knowledge and I've finally bought myself a vehicle.
I bought a '72 bus in pretty nice shape.

I am hearing something that doesn't sound right to me though. When I accelerate, I hear a whining 
sound. Same sound as when I reverse in my other car. I don't remember that sound when I drove a 
bus a few years ago. Is this a sign of tranny trouble?

Also, the van seems to surge a bit when I'm driving at a steady speed. It kind of tries to jump 
forward even though I haven't moved my foot on the pedal. Any ideas where to start looking?

I'm new to this stuff, and just need a bit of help getting pointed in the right direction.

Thanks.
