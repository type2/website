Subject: '80 Vanagon Stalling

Hi,

My '80 Westfalia has a problem with stalling.  Idles good, but when going down 
the road wants to shut off:  Jerks and Lunges.  Then after a few seconds of this 
runs ok again.  Also tends to stall upon coming to a stop.  When it does stall, 
I smell gas; and it wont start back up until it has cooled for a few minutes.  
When it does start up - grey smoke, then ok.  I've tuned it, timed it, new 
plugs, new ign. points/condenser, etc.  During a trip a few weeks ago, I had a 
shop whose reputation was unknown to me fix my break lights - I wonder if 
something electrical has been screwed up by them? 

Fuel Pump?  EGR Valve?  FI problem?  Any suggestions?
Any recommendations for a shop to do repairs in the Washington, DC/N. Virginia 
area?

Thanks for any advice!

Greg S.
