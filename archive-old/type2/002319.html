Steve,

Don't get me wrong here - I'm a big fan of FI. I just think that for many
situations other options need to be explored. I've never posted a response
to anyone suggesting blatently that they trash the FI and go with a carb.
I've always tried to help someone diagnose an FI problem but I like to point
out that converting to a carb is an option that also works well and is
CHEAP. (I've pointed out multiple times that I purchased a Weber Progressive
kit for my '77 2 years ago and I couldn't be happier - $200 for the kit -
$25 for the fuel pump).

As a result of my posts regarding FI over the last year I've received
*three* off-list e-mails from people who feel that others on the list
degrade and insult whenever the option of changing to carbs is discussed.
You won't find these messages in the archive friends - these are from people
who now remain quiet on the subject because of certain FI enthusiasts who
will hear of no other options. Hence the term FI nazi. Please don't start a
thread regarding the polical-incorrectness of this term - I am by definition
politcally incorrect and have no plans to change.

&gt; How many carburators do you know that have not been overhauled several
times in more than &gt; 20 years?

I ran my 69 bus with only one carb over the 15 years that I had it. I
overhauled it once. I consider this typical. Maintenance is the key. Change
filters (air/fuel) often.

&gt;The Bosch FI system has nearly 100
&gt;connectors which could now be prone to rattle loose.

Indeed. 100 connections that are prone to fretting corrosion, galvanic
corrosion, and good old fashion oxidation. Not to mention heat, oil, wear,
and physical abuse. The fact that many buses still run with FI means that
this was a pretty reliable system. It also means that intermittent problems
start popping up, they will probably happen again - somewhere in those 100
connection points - because the components *never* fail (sarcasm).

&gt;Second, the Bosch FI system is not that tough to diagnose.

Any system with 100 connections in the wiring harness alone can be tough to
diagnose - particularly intermittent ones.


Once again I want to point out that I AM an FI advocate. I just realize that
an old and intermittent FI system may not be the most enjoyable route for
many folks.
