Recently sold one - just the tank - no fixtures - to a listmember 
for fifty bucks plus shipping.  Maybe i got ripped off, but it sounded 
reasonable to me... it was a good tank.  Sell yer stuff to listmembers for cheap!  Keeps Morale up!

&gt;I have one and I'm willing to sell it, but I'm not sure what a fair 
&gt;price would be.  I've been told they're worth everything from $150 to 
&gt;$500...
