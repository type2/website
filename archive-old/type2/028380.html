Sean et al,
	 I spotted this a year or 2 ago and tried without success to get an old
diesel Golf (Rabbit?) to run on a refinement of used veg. oil. A small
simple processor is needed, build it and you are out of the OPEC loop. I
emailed Kennedy Engineering to see if they had anything in diesel conversion
kits for the bus but sadly not. I have a good book. &quot;From the fryer to the
fuel tank&quot; Its on www.veggievan_dot_org lots of other inf. too.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Looking through Parade magazine (comes with many Sunday papers throughout
&gt; the country) I saw an article on young inventors, and the lead group had
&gt; taken an '82 Vanagon camper and put a VW Quantum turbo diesel engine in
&gt; which runs on cooking grease.  Since of course cooking grease is
&gt; pretty much
&gt; solid at room temperature they had to devised a fuel heating
&gt; system to allow
&gt; the fuel to flow freely.  They are now on a road trip around the country
&gt; fueling up with cooking grease donated by various eateries in the
&gt; towns they
&gt; visit.
&gt;
&gt; Their web page is at http://www.greasecar_dot_com
