  Volks,
I own a vanagon, type 2, and a beetle, and sold my rabbit cabriolet
recently.  It was an 86, and I found I still have the brand new boot that
goes over the top when it is folded down.  It is white in color.

I emailed this to the lists for a lot of you are vw nuts and might own one
of these thinngs and can use this boot.  First $50 gets it, and it is new!
