Subject: Help identifying der &quot;m-codes&quot; on '76 DC

Meine leiben affen,

I've got a '76 double cab that I need some help in identifying the =
m-codes on it. I've checked the mcodes on Thom Fitzpatrick's page, =
but I fear that those are for splitties and not loaves (loafs).

Plate on the left side behind the drivers seat:

Plate behind right front passenger seat:

|  Typ 26-16                                  |

A friend here at work says that it translates to roughly the =
following:
________________________________________________________
|                       VOLKSWAGENWERK AG              |
|                        West Germany                  |
|  Type 26-16                                          |
|  Heater Type 2/255 A          Check No. ~ mS45       |
|  Chassis No. 2662116441                              |
|  Allowed Toll Weight. kg 2300     Build date         |
|  Allowed front axel weight kg 1010 rear kg 1300      |
|______________________________________________________|

Can anyone verify this translation? The interesting thing to me is =
that it's missing an actual build date. I'll certainly go back and =
check it more thoroughly as I was doing this late last night with a =
flashlight in my mouth. But I don't think the build date was there.

Danka in advance,

Bren
