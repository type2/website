&gt; I have tried scrubbing one of the oil spills on my hands and knees with hot

I use kitty litter (not the clumping kind) and use a broom to brush it
into the spot, throw away and repeat.  doesn't remove all of the mark but
it does remove the slippery and it is dry so you can lay on it without
getting it on you

good luck
