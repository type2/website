Subject: '72 - '75 engine tin part needed

I'm replacing the passenger side heat exchanger and I need the little piece 
of tin that attaches to the heat exchanger and the fan housing.  It bolts to 
the top of the heater box right where it to connects to the fan housing.  
P-mail if you can help.  Pay cash or trade for parts.

I think mine fell off when the heater box let loose.

This is the last heater box I had from the secret asbestos recall a couple of 
years back.  The pipes on both sides failed where they are press fit into the 
cast fittings that bolt to the heads?  Otherwise the boxes are in excellent 
shape.

I tried having the drivers side welded, but the heat distorted the pipes and 
they wouldn't line up.  Anyone else have this same problem with their free 
heater boxes?
