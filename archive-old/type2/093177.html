Subject: Re:VW dealers: Dont get me started RANT 

I am about to reveal a closely protected secret known only to a few select 
auto dealers.

Try to understand, Jason, that the dealer doesn't DARE sell a car to anyone 
that is not a true believer.  They were testing you with that line, to see 
if you really had the faith and enthusiasm and commitment required to be 
one of their customers.

You didn't pass the screening. You didn't have the right stuff.

When they DO sell that car, their way, the buyer will behave like a robot 
and will do everything they say instantly and without question, always. 
They will be in complete control. They won't even let him DRIVE the car 
after he buys it. They will keep the car on the showroom floor and require 
him to come in three times a week and wipe off the dust and 
fingerprints.  Then he gets to sit in it, unmolested and unsupervised, for 
7 minutes. That is his reward. After all, there is only ONE such car in 
their dealership.

Using these sales practices, they reduce the cost of their floor plan 
(technical term: bank finance charges to maintain new car inventory until 
they can be sold.)   And the sales  people don't have to take care of the 
showroom stock. Everybody is happy, even the guy who now owns the car but 
still can't drive it.

After a year of ownership in this fashion, the carefully screened and 
selected robot buyer gets to drive the car out of the showroom (because it 
is a used car by now, legally), and they bring in next year's model and do 
it all over again.

You just have to be broad minded, Jason, and look at things from 
everybody's viewpoint. Realize that there are others in this world that 
look at things differently than you do.

That dealer is managing things so he can keep cars on his floor at minimal 
cost. It is a tough world out in New Car Land. Only the strong and 
determined and innovative survive.

I suggest that you consider acquiring that car from the robot buyer, after 
he owns it in the showroom for a year. By then, he is programmed to do 
anything anyone tells him, and he may even give you the car if you ask for it.

So I went with a friend who wanted to buy a new car:
.....snip..........He says, &quot;No you cannot ever test drive this car, nobody
is allowed to&quot;. I look at him like he's crazy, and say why not?
No test drives on this car only so many were made. WHAT? I cant test a car I
might buy!?!?!? Are they insane?
......snip.........................
OK Volkswagen. You win. You have insisted on copyrights to kill the
aftermarket, and now you wont even let someone testdrive your cars.
I will buy a Toyota. Thank you for helping me make the decision.
Jason
