Subject: Westy seat belts

Hi everybody!

I just got back from Circle Yer Wagens, but I wish I had stayed.  I thought I 
was going to have to travel this evening.  This show keeps getting bigger and 
bigger (and the weather keeps getting hotter and hotter)!  There was lots to 
see and do and buy there.

I bought some seat belts to replace the ones in the back of my Westy (see 
signature line).  What I had in there were out of a '73 (orange button that 
says &quot;press&quot;).  What I bought were a mixed bag from '67-'71.  I cleaned 'em 
up and mounted them, but alas, the buckle part (with the little white lever) 
hardly comes through the crack in the seat.  There must be a different style 
for the Westy.  Can someone pleasepleaseplease, point me in the right 
direction to get these (part number, boneyard search, etc.)?  My six-year-old 
daughter may not be eternally grateful, but I sure would.
