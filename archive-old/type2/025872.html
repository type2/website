Hi Volks,

In the quest to continue the improvement of &quot;Bob the Tomato&quot;, I took a few
minutes today to create a unique logo based on the &quot;WESTFALIA&quot; insignia on
the luggage rack of Jamie River's 74 Campmobile.

With some quick digital imaging and vector alignment in Adobe Illustrator I
was able to create an authentic looking &quot;WESTFAKIA&quot; logo in vector-based
.PDF format.  Check it out for yourself, I posted it online at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2/WESTFAKIA.PDF

I'll be getting at least one of these output at a local sign shop operated
by a friend of mine. If you want to order one for your own bus, I'll get
them made up for you and ship them, let me know if you're interested and
I'll get back to you with the price.

Wear this unique and hard-earned badge of vehicular personalization with
pride!

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
