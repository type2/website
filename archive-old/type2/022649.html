&gt;The other thing to remember is that you need the correct, metric-sized fuel
lines for &gt;your bus. There are American-standard sized lines that are close,
but they only &gt;work with tight clamps and that doesn't give me the fit I want
for *my* bus. I don't &gt;remember the right size, so I won't hazard a guess.
Anyone remember?&lt;

Hi ---its 5 mm ID - I've just fitted new fuel hose from the tank thro' to the
carb. and hope that will last some time !

Anyone have experience about the time I can expect the hose to last before it
gets brittle ??- I also did the bulk head fitting. I have used the  german
hose- it has rubber material inside with a sheith of reinforcement- fibre of
some kind, on the outside.
