Subject: Re: [T2] engine height in inches

  Hi Jeremiah,

Tonight myself and two helpers rolled a bus onto a pair of ramps. It  
took a few test rolls back and forth and then we were able to get up  
on top.

The engine was out about two hours later.


Happy trails,

&gt; checked bently and counldn't find it anywhere.  does anyone know  
&gt; the height
&gt; in inches of a 1800 75 ED engine w/ the FI removed.  i need to drop  
&gt; the
&gt; engine and am trying to find a way to get her high enough since i  
&gt; stupidly
&gt; did not drive her up on ramps before i took all the FI off and  
&gt; misc. other
&gt; parts.
