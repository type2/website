computer stuff is fun. ( new to me, it's exciting.) Forgot to mention
the motor I installed was a Brazilian case with Mexico heads. Couldn't
tell where it was assembled, but it was in a factory box. It had 3\4
inch NGK plugs in it and no distributor drive gear or shims. Came with
a new late oil cooler, no stand-off, though. If I remember it was an
AS 41 case. And yes, NO WARRANTY!!!! Personally, my own thought, my
own opinion&gt; If I wanted to put one in a type 2, I would wait awhile
until the miles get racked up and feedback starts coming in until I
spent the money. Like I said, my friend was kind enough to be a guniea
pig of sorts. I live in Nevada but I don't gamble. Thanks again. Jim

I find it interesting that they included an oil cooler.  They probably
don't want old coolers from just-grenaded engines being installed on
the new engines.

I like the idea of 3/4 reach plugs!  Much less likely to strip and
probably more meat in that area of the head which might make it more
crack-resistant.

I thought that the AS-41 case was the less desirable one.  Perhaps I
misremembered.  Both of our aircoolers have this case.

I wouldn't expect VW de Mexico or VW do Brasil to warranty engines
exported out of their countries by third parties.  As I recall, the
retailers selling the engines in VW T&amp;A were advertising a
12mo/12000mi warranty, undoubtedly their own.  Naturally, you pay for
the warrenty in the retail price of the engine.

Since 1600s were put into all Mexican and Brazilian buses until they
went to watercooling I'd venture to say that the engine will give good
service in a typ 2.  They are undoubtedly better than the &quot;crate&quot;
rebuilds from GEX, etc.  The price isn't really that much higher,
either, when you include the core charge that the crate rebuilders
nearly always end up keeping (&quot;Your case was cracked&quot;, etc.)

Does anyone know what engine number prefixes are used on these
engines? It'd sure be nice to identify these engines without having to
crawl under to peer up at the side of the sump!
