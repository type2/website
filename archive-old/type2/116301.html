Subject: Re: [VB] neighbors suck/65 project bus FOR SALE/trade eugene OR

Code violations are pretty lax here in Florida. When I first moved here,
they were pretty strict about things. 
I hope no one minds, but I relate the major change to Jeb Bush being in
office here. Since then, we no longer have inspections, emissions testing,
or the crappy &quot;IMPACT FEE&quot; that Florida used to charge you. It was a
$100-$200 dollar fee they would charge depending on the value of the car,
when you registered it for the first time in Florida.

On the down side though, people took advantage of the tax-break &quot;COLLECTOR
CAR&quot; plate, so they got rid of it. I think it would give you a registration
tax break on cars older than 20 years old. Often times though, you'd see a
25 year old, beat up Chevy work van, or Dodge Diplomat or something, that a
painter, or general contractor was using for the daily driver. Doesn't
exactly constitute a collector car.

I've had a couple issues with the local Police when I first moved here. They
left a WARNING on my 82 TransAm because the tag was expired. They did the
same for my 1985 Pontiac Fiero that I have, and also for my 1976 Camaro
LT-350 I used to have.

Right now, I have in my front yard, a 1984 Pontiac Fiero, a 1987 Pontiac
Fiero (Neither with up-to-date tags), and my GrandAm. I share a 1978
Cadillac Eldorado Biarrtiz Convertible (custom.. heh we chopped the roof
off) that I leave in the driveway sometimes. The 73 VW Bus, and the 1981
TransAm are in the garage. I put the BUS in the garage just because I don't
want it to get rained on.

Other than that, we have our regular cars, my 1997 GrandAm, my fiance's 2002
VW Jetta, and her cousin's 1997 Ford Ranger (he rents a room from us). 

DIRECTLY across the culdesac from us, there is a Florida Highway Patrol car
(owned by a pretty cool guy who bought 400 dollars worth of illegal
fireworks for us in the culdesac on the 4th of July), DIRECLTY across from
my house is a North Miami Beach Police patrol car (a woman), and adjacent to
us is a Plantation Police patrol car. By far, we have the most cars in the
neighborhood, and no one has complained. I keep the 84 Fiero usually parked
on the side of the house behind the fence. So on any given day, there are 4
cars in the driveway.

My GrandAm, the Ford Ranger, The VW Jetta, and my 1987 Pontiac Fiero. All
four cars fit on the driveway, and all cars are in pristine condition.. so
they don't look trashy.


I dunno about the condition of most of your cars.. but usually the police
make citations because someone else complains. You have to figure though,
the VW Bus is MASSIVE... if you've got 5 of them sitting in your driveway,
all with bad paint, flat tires.. whatever... it's going to make the
neighborhood look trashy. 99% of the people in this world are NOT car
people. While they may appreciate a perfectly restored car, it would never
enter into their mind to buy an old car. So while they see these beat up
monstrosities in the driveway, they think trash. 

The best advice I have is.. if you don't have the right kind of house to
store them in, then don't keep them.. or move somewhere else.

It kinda sucks... but it's like the neighbor that has the huge collection of
lawn ornaments... 99% of the people in the world think it's trashy.
