&gt; Well, I have spent the last week and a half listening to and
&gt; learning the sounds of my bus.  And I have realized two things.  The
&gt; first is that I have an exhaust leak on the drivers side.  The leak
&gt; is coming from the front area of the heater box, but I can't tell if
&gt; it is the heater box or where it connects, or what it connects to.
&gt; Is there anyway to tell where the leak is coming from without
&gt; replacing all the parts.  I tried to run my hand over the area to
&gt; see where it is coming from, but I just felt heat and couldn't tell.

To track down an exhaust leak on my 79 I hooked up a shop vac to the
exhaust tip &amp; turned it on blow. With a nice cool engine &amp; mucho air
moving from the vac into the engine backwards it was very easy to tell
where the leaks were comming from.

&gt; The second thing I realized is that I need to install a stereo.  I
&gt; have a stereo, but do not know where two of the wires connect.  One
&gt; needs to be connected to the power supply and one needs to be
&gt; connected to the memory B+.  I have a red wire coming out of the
&gt; fuse box right above the number 10 fuse.  Is this where I should
&gt; connect the power?  Also, underneath the dash there is a metal piece
&gt; that runs from the emergency brake to the front of the body.  This
&gt; piece bolts to the body.  And where it bolts there is an electrical
&gt; connector.  It is shaped like a c and slips around the bolt.  It has
&gt; a short length of black wire crimped on to it (the way you crimp
&gt; wire to a push on connector).  The wire is only an inch long and
&gt; must have been cut.  Does anyone know how to hook up a stereo,
&gt; and/or what these wires are for?  Does anyone have any diagrams of

On most stereo units you will have 3 main wires other than any
control/speaker wires. 2 power wires which take +12v and one ground. I
never can remember which wire (red or yellow) gets the always on
power, but one will. This is the one that the memory/etc uses. The
other should provide power when the engine is running. I highly advise
putting an extra in-line fuse in if there isn't one. Take a VOM or
test light &amp; see what terminals on your fuse block either stay on all
the time or only when the ignition is &quot;on&quot; &amp; hook the proper wires to
those. I wouldn't trust that ground wire. Create your own. I don't see
a problem using the same location just make sure you have a good
ground.

&gt; how to do this?   Also, anyone installed speakers in the rear of
&gt; there westy without taking up a lot of precious storage space?  Does
&gt; anyone have pictures of this?  Thanks, Peace, Kyle
