Subject: Re: [T2] Wing window latch removal

[...]

&gt; Is there any special trick or tool needed to remove the latch on the wing
&gt; window? I need to take the one off of my &quot;old&quot; bus, as the  driver's side
wing
&gt; window latch on my &quot;new &quot; bus is missing the black knob that you grip.
Bentley
&gt; offers no enlightenment on this particular subject.
&gt; Could I just take the knob off, or is that more of a PITA?

Easiest way is with a 1/16 pin punch. Drive out the roll pin at base of the
arm where it pivots at the window.
But this does not work if you have 68-only vent windows. They are riveted on
to the frame.
I have not found a way to swap just the spring loaded knobs yet.
