On 8/28/00 12:16 PM, mhogg_at_fastweb_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;Don't travle alone and personally, I would never
&gt;stop at a rest stop. There are State Parks all
&gt;over
&gt;the country where people are required to register
&gt;their names and vehicles. That is a much safer
&gt;place
&gt;to stay the night.

Don't forget walmarts and truck stops. Truck stops are esp. good, as 
hollering is likely to bring out some burly fellows with crowbars. You 
get used to diesel engines after a while.


Peace,
