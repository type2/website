I disagree on *mildly* packing the hub.  I've seen many unpacked hubs that
had enough rust in them to ruin the bearings.  Everything in that
environment needs to be at least coated with grease to prevent corrosion.  I
pack my hubs near full with Valv-Moly, which is not like gorilla snot and
have never had a problem.

What application have you experienced where too much grease has ruined a
bearing on a VW?  I'm gonna call ya on that one big boy.

If you packed the hub, then the heat build up from the bearings is expanding
the grease and forceing it out.  The only grease that should be in there is
the grease that is packed into the bearings, all other grease is useless and
a waste of money.

In some applications too much grease can create so much pressure it can ruin
the bearing.  As for the front wheels, it just gets pushed past the seals
and dust cap.  I hope you used high temperature grease made for disk brakes.
