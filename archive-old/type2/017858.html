After 3 and 1/2 years of waiting, my 78 Westy (elmer fudd) is alive and
running well.
This is the bus that was blowing oil out of the dipstick hole.  Turns
out that the previous rebuild went awry and that the cylinder walls were
badly scored, allowing the blow by to push the oil out the dipstick
hole.  After another rebuild, this one by the great folks at Johnson's
Enterprises,  Statesville, N.C. (who are GREAT with type IV engines) it
is running again.

    A few questions:
      What is the conventional wisdom regarding the fiberglass scoops
that can be added to enhance the airflow to the engine?

       Does anyone have the information about the rear shock with the
helper springs for the late 70's westy's to set the rear up without
having to go the the ordeal of resetting the torsion on the rear axle?

     Has anywone installed a front tire carrier on a 78 Westy?  How do
you get to the place to drill for the bolts that pass from the inside to
the outside?

      What makes grown people go so crazy over these things.  My wife
and I are like we've had our first grandchild?

Thanks for any replies.
