Subject: Re: [T2] Lots of engine questions


&gt;My engine came out pretty much complete (except air cleaner/AFM), but I
&gt;think it will have more clearance going back in without the distributor. I'm
&gt;going to cover the hole and make sure the engine doesn't rotate with the
&gt;dizzy out.


Don't worry about the engine rotating. The dist can only fit one way.

Insert dist, rotate the dist shaft with gentle pressure downward. IT will 
snap into place when the drive and shaft mate.

Love that feature about the VW's.


Ciao!
