Woohoo!!!

&gt;Now my question is what is it good for? The fridge in the 81 is propane or
&gt;shore powered so no need there. I can envision some interior, or even
&gt;exterior,  lighting but otherwise I'm drawing a blank. How do you folks who
&gt;have the batteries put them to use?

Let's see... how about a nice CD stereo that you can play when camped (not
loud enough to offend anyone else of course), and all of the things you
need to run off of the inverter.  You're going to get an inverter, right?

With the inverter you can plug in a laptop, recharge camcorder batteries,
plug in a coffee pot, electric razor, and most importantly, TOOLS!  Trouble
lights, drills, dremel, soldering iron, you name it.  It's very handy to
have A/C power wherever you go.

p.s. Don't forget the Christmas lights!
