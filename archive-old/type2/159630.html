&gt; Reassemble it the same as it came apart.  Mount the fan/pulley on the 
&gt; crank, set up a dial indicator, and &quot;nudge&quot; the pulley with a light 
&gt; plastic hammer until it's running true.  Then remove the fan/pulley from 

I think that would work well for centering it.  Kinda like how you true 
a bicycle wheel.

&gt; the crank and torque the 4 bolts down. Since I haven't changed anything, 
&gt; the balance should be unaffected.  (actually, it should be *better* 

doubt that.  Since you have moved the fan relative to the rest of the 
pully, it is probably out of balance.

Once you get it back together, bring it to a machine shop and have them 
balance it.  Should cost you a whole 15 bux or something around there.

&gt; Option #2.
&gt; Buy another fan/pulley from the friendly local VW guy, clean it up and 
&gt; call it good.

Wouldn't do that because you'd end up spending money for the part and 
then cost you money to have it balanced, which you should do regardless, 
including any other parts that spin real fast.

&gt; Option #3. Send the fan/pulley off to a race shop to be put back 
&gt; together and balanced all over again.

That would work as well ;)

&gt; 
&gt; No matter what, I made a mental note (burned in with a soldering iron), 
&gt; &quot;Do Not Disassemble The Cooling Fan/Pulley!&quot;

It's all good.  At least you learn from it...
