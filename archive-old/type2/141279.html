Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator question...which of these to buy?

&gt; Which to get? What is the difference? From Bus Depot.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternator
&gt; 55 Amp Bosch, Rebuilt
&gt; Part Reference Number*: AL79X
&gt; Dealer Retail Price*: $257.23
&gt; Brand: Bosch/Germany*
&gt; $71.53
&gt;  
&gt; Alternator
&gt; Bosch Rebuilt, standard output
&gt; Part Reference Number*: AL75X
&gt; Dealer Retail Price*: $216.00
&gt; Brand: Bosch/Germany*
&gt; $99.19


Meg,
The difference is that one fits a Bus and one does not.  The AL79X fits
Rabbits and other watercooled cars.  The AL75X fits most 72-up Busses.
(There is also a higher-output AL108X found on some later model Busses,
although this is less common.) If you choose your year/model from the
drop-down menu on busdepot_dot_com, then you can avoid inadvertantly viewing
parts that don't fit a Bus. Also, if you click on the part listing and
scroll down, there is a list of what vehicles the part fits.
