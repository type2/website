Subject: Re: Exhaust smell in my heat, Please help

&gt;     I don't understand how the exhaust smell is getting into the bus.  If
&gt;the heat exchangers are leaking, would that cause a noticeable engine
&gt;popping when decelerating under load (going down hill in gear)?  I don't
&gt;have any popping/backfiring noise.  I know that when the exhaust header got
&gt;loose (in the past), I got the popping.  I don't know what else to check.
&gt;     I think the bus is running rich, could that be causing an excess of
&gt;exhaust fumes?  If so, then how are they getting into the bus?

The fan might be sucking them in through a leak in your engine seal or
engine hatch seal.
