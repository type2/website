&gt;What about those of us that occasionally take extended trips.
&gt;Is there a way to temporarily drop from the list, and just
&gt;recive the digest when you return.

There's only subscribe and unsubscribe. You'd be surprised how many people
unsubscribe every Friday and pick it back up on Monday.

&gt;What is your best suggestion for alternate heat?

I expect the heater is adequate for your clime. The below-zero crowd
complains a lot, but if you warm it up for five minutes in the driveway
like you ought to do in the winter, you should be okay.

&gt;Hamburg, Germany.  they had been coming to America
&gt;every year for the past ten.  They would load there
&gt;bus on a freighter, (which also rents cabins, much to
&gt;my surprise) and come to America and tour it and it's
&gt;bordering countries.

Does anybody know if they have passage like this to Australia? It would be
very cool to put together a cross-world bus trek. We could maritime it over
there and then William Warburton and them could indulge our whims and take
us sightseeing. ;) Anybody up for a Bottom of the World Trek?
