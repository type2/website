Subject: Vanagon Motor Conversion

Hi People,

I have a 73 Westy, which was sold originally by a dealer in New Brunswick. It has
112,000 miles on it, and the motor was rebuilt about 20000 miles ago. It runs well.
Better, in fact, than my Dads 82 Vanagon Westy. It has about the same mileage, but
originated in California. We've gone on trips this summer with both vans, and have
found that the 73 consistently runs away from the 82 on a long hill.

Is this a symptom of the smog controls on the 82 model? His van has EFI, mine runs
dual carbs. Dad is really unhappy cresting long hills in third gear. What can be
done to that motor to regain the oomph that has gone astray?

Dad heard somewhere there was a conversion kit that fit a GM 2.8L V6 into the
vanagon engine compartment, bolting to the original tranny. No hard evidence of
this is available. Is this possible, or are we talking about a mechanical urban
legend?

Any suggestions/referrals would be welcome.
