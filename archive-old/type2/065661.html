Subject: Re; Revell Germany Vanagon Model, USA 'Deal's Wheel's' van, etc. 

        The Revell Germany Vanagon kit, UN or fire comany version
is basicly the same kit as the Magnum PI Vanagon kit. Same basic
mold, but not in root-beer-metal-flake. It is the only 1:24/1:25
Transporter scale model in production at the moment. Its for
the AIR COOLED '81 model, but comes with a decal for the radiator
grille to make later years!

        BEWARE!! The &quot;Deal's Wheel's&quot; split-window kit that's
just been reissued by Revell-Monogram USA is a CARACTURE, not
the old Revell panel-van kit. Fun if you like car caractures,
but not a VW bus scale model.

        OTOH, my loving wife bought me the Franklin Mint '62 splitie
for my birthday this year and its AWESOME. Cloth sunroof that works, 
optional gas heater, etc, etc. Made in China, but heck, one
item a year isn't going to make or break anything. What's the
L code for that salmon pink color? It's salmon-pink and off-white,
with grey interior, white shift and brake lever, I forget the
color of the steering wheel, white wheels with chrome hubcaps.
        It's 1:24

        Am I a lucky guy or what?? :)

        Happy motoring!
        Bill
