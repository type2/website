Subject: Re: [T2] Junkyard finds, rear s belts

+AD4-my main query is some seat belts that came from the Westy (72).  They are
labeled 1971 and feature the lever release.  The belts are pretty
+AD4-stiff.  Will they loosen up with use.

When you say stiff is this the belt itself or the retract mechanism?

My 63 Beetle passenger belt was very stiff, and then when I had water
splashing in through a small hole in the floor they got wet and very cheesy
smelling, so I took them off and washed them. They are now perfectly supple.
