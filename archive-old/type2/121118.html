Subject: Re: [T2] starter motor troubles -update

Looks like the problem is gone. I replaced the starter motor and 
solenoid with a spare and the bus starts up just fine. Most of the
suggestions were that it was probably a weak solenoid, which makes
perfect sense now. I did cleanup my electrical connections just a
few months prior so there was not much corrosion buildup to clean
off. I also went ahead and tested out the 'bad' solenoid with a
pair of jumper cables and it seems to work...  Also I did want to
mention that a dremel works great for cleaning up electrical
connections. I used the small wire brush attachment to clean up
the starter connections, etc. Sure works well and saves a lot of
 time.

Thanks for the help
Alex

&gt;
&gt;&gt;'m having a bit of trouble with the starter motor on my bus.  The
&gt;&gt;trouble started last week
&gt;&gt;when I heard an usual noise coming from the starter.  So this morning I
&gt;&gt;hop in and crank the
&gt;&gt;engine and all I'd get was a sound that sound like a machine gun...??
&gt;&gt;Sorry that's the best
&gt;&gt;way I can describe it.  The noise is very loud and the starter sounds to
&gt;&gt;be turning over quite
&gt;&gt;quick......
