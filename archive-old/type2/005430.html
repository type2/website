My 79 transporter was running well, started easy, but would backfire a bit
on decel, (which is explainable by the exhaust leak)
so I thought I would mess with it and see what I could do to &quot;improve&quot; it.

I took off the dist cap and rotor, checked them out, lightly sanded the
contact on top and the contact for the plug wires, lightly oiled the center
post  and put it back together.

When I re-started the engine it ran for a minute, began backfiring/misfiring
and eventually died. I could not get it to start again.

I replaced the cap and rotor. No change.

Any ideas where the failure is?

And how does a single person work on a BUS? I cannot crank the engine from
the front and watch the spark at the back.

And fitting a remote starter connection is really difficult. Any tips?

Gracias,
Chuck
