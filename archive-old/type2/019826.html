&gt; so...went to check the level before I left work and the oil level was much
&gt; higher..almost to the top line on the dip stick...Any ideas what is going on
&gt; here? Thanks for the help...Adam

Was the bus standing absolutely horizontal during the first AND the
second check?
Did you take out the dipstick, clean it and then check the level again?
I noticed that if you just take the dipstick out it often indicates the
wrong oil level.

Otherwise I haven't got a clue what is going on. You got any spare
oil-reservoirs in your engine?
