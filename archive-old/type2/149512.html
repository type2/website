Subject: Re: [T2] unclear symptoms

I ended up checking for corrosion which was minimal but there somewhat.
I had already done the new cables concerning the battery so that was easy :)
I went to NAPA auto parts and picked up a selenoid and some ends, used 10 
gauge
wire and installed the hot start relay. ($30 canadian total for parts)

It seems to turn over alot faster but it's hard to say since your mind can
play tricks on you at times. I'm going to go drive around and see if I can
recreate the 'nostart' condition just for the fun of it.
(no work today)

Thanks for the ideas and I will keep the list updated if anything develops.

The &quot;Hard Start Relay&quot; sounds like something that
could improve your starting problem.  It is cheap, and
could actually fix your problem.  This one is a clone
from California Import Auto, but it is still
available:
