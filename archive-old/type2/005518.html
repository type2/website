What you need is our Powerstroke Bus Special!!

The stock powerband is kept, but with a ton of added torque....My 74 Bus,
with 2K of payload climbs hills and even mountains and still accelerates.

     OK, here is the deal.  I am still very frustrated with the power output
of my stock 82 westy.  It just has such a lack of both acceleration &amp; top
end power.  I am not looking for a rocket ship.  I was very content with my
76 westy with the same engine.  Almost all hills in the PDX area are 3 gear
below 50MPH events.  The van will do 70MPH but it really does not like it.
65MPH is where it seems to want to drive.  I can live with that most of the
time.  With my 76, there was very few hills around here that I had to
downshift for.  65 was the norm.  What I am really looking for is some one
in the PDX area to come &amp; take my van for a drive &amp; compare it to their
air-cooled van.  Since this is the only Vanagon I have ever had, I have no
frame of reference.  Let me know what you all think.  Thanks.  BTW, except
for the power, I love the Vanagon.
