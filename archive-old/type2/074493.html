Subject: my stuff


Hello,

I was on this list previously and left because i didn't have time to deal 
with all the messages generated here.  Has there been any etalk about making 
even more division than there are not.  My years of '68 to '71 are 
represented here but much of the traffic is '72 and later,as late as '86 
water cooled unless i am mistaken.  My vans are doing well except for a 
stutter and cough once i get warmed up.  The gas filter never seems to have 
hardly any gas in it and i have had to almost close the choke to get it to 
run at all.  Starting off, the van has plenty of power, as it should since 
it is a newly rebuilt engine from a '73 super beetle.  I cannot say the same 
for the carb (I know someone is going to ask what carb it is but i will have 
to check and even then i don't know if i will be able to tell but i would 
guess there is something in the archives about that.)  I am curious but this 
may not matter as i have found another van and soon will be switching 
everything i need from one to the other.  But if i could find out what was 
wrong with the one i have now i might hold onto the engine.  I also have 
located a '73 bus which need an engine or work on a stuck engine.  Anyone 
interested.  the body is in very good shape and the guy wants to get rid of 
that and a couple more he has sitting around not in as good of shape.

So take what you will from this email.  my opinion stated, i am glad to be 
back on the list and look forward to reading those responses.  Formerly
