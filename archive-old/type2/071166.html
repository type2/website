Subject: Replacing Drag link?- 72 bus

--part1_c4.18a6ca16.28a72d11_boundary

Hi!

I got a new drag link for my bus. Now just take the nuts off and remove the 
old drag link and put the new drag link in?

Do I need to take the load off the front end? ex, jack stands?

One end of the drag link has a set screw(to prevent that end from turning) 
How is that end suppost to be set? The same as the old one of course. . . I 
don't want to do anything wrong though.

What are the chances of my swing lever(part the drag link attaches to) being 
worn? Where could I get a replacement? Wolfsburg West did not have a swing 
lever replacement. 

Ok thanks
Matt Davalor
