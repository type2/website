Subject: Re: [T2] vent window assembly


Dana, list:
Didn't VW eliminate these vent windows in 1978 and 1979? This would be a good
way to eliminate these problem, if you don't care about opening vents in the
back seat area. They used bypassing sliders in the center seat area.
I actually did not PREFER the later windows, nor the sliders on the Vanagons,
because they lead to buffeting noises that the early cars did not have.

&gt; Does anyone have or know of a complete vent window assembly for the driver
&gt; side rear window of a bay window? (mine is a 74 Westy). This is the only
&gt; piece that is holding back getting this project out of the shop and on the
&gt; road. The original piece I have is rusted beyond use and the parts busses I
&gt; have looked at have similar problems.
