Subject: RE: [T2] Engine to Tranny - 3 bolts?

I have an VW powered trike that I built. When I got the engine and
transmission for it, the engine was only being held on by 2 bolts. One on
each side, opposite corners. The started only had one of the bolts. It was
being driven around in a bug for who knows how long like this. Still works
good today with all bolts and not parts replaced.

THE

not
&gt; referenced by the Bentley manual - apparently the one that is not needed?


&gt; Since the books seem to contradict each other, which one is correct? Does
a
&gt; stock '71 only need 3 bolts? If so I'd like to leave the upper left off
due

I always had all four in my 71 IIRC and I have always felt like a VW
engine wasn't held in tight enough for my nervous self. (no never had one
fall out)  so I would be anal about putting in all four, but the right
size and yes they are a relatively minor PITA to get in and out.
