Subject: [T2] Exhaust sensor - do I need it for my CA fuel injection system


&gt; I have a 83 aircooled Vanagon california emissions.
&gt; there is a sensor that connects to my wiring harness
&gt; that is literally screwed into the exhaust system just
&gt; before the catalytic converter.  I am transfering my
&gt; emissions over to an earlier no CA model exhaust - do
&gt; I need the exhaust sensor to be connected to run
&gt; right? if so, i will have to drill in a hole in my
&gt; exhaust pipe.

It's not clear to me what you're doing here.  Are you transferring the
emission stuff - EGR, EGR filter and O2 sensor - over to an earlier non-Cal
VW or are you pulling the exhaust system out of a California model vehicle,
to be replaced with non-Cal exhaust components?

The O2 sensor sends a signal to the ECU which modifies the air/fuel ratio
according to that signal.  If you have a California wiring harness with a
connector for the O2 sensor and a California ECU which can act on that
signal, then you should weld in a bung for the O2 sensor.  If the wiring
harness has no O2 connector or the ECU is a non-Cal model not equipped to
accept an O2 sensor signal then don't worry about adding the O2 sensor to
the exhaust system.
