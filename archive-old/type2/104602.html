&gt; Has anyone ever had a 411/412 engine in a 72 westy and converted it to the

I had a 411 engine as my spare for the 78 for a number of years.
I used the Fuel injection

&gt; What is involved?

suprisingly not that much

&gt; I can see adding and checking the oil as a fun chore.

well my 78 has a hatch, you have my condolences, unless you get an engine
from a station wagen, it had the dipstick and fill in the rear
