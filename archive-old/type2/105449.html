Subject: Re: [T2] First Ride

&gt; &gt; Is the stick supposed to lay up against the side of your right leg?  Or
is
&gt; &gt; my bus just letting me know that he's fond of his new owner?
&gt;
&gt; No. Bentley has the correct orientation (Transmission and Rear Axle, page
&gt; 11).

Ah, well, that depends on how wide you spread your legs whilst &quot;reversing,&quot;
as the English say...  If you're a big guy, with a Texan splay to your legs,
I could see the shifter sort of cozying up to your right leg.  :o)
