Subject: Re: How do I get the #&amp;(*&amp;!$# distributor gear on the crank?


&gt;I first tried heating the gears in oil, the second time I tried boiling
&gt;water.  But in both cases I wasn't able to slip the gear on the crank;
&gt;they &quot;froze&quot; to the crank almost immediately after they touched the
&gt;crank and I had to get out my torch and heat them up to pull them off.

I would think the clue is in the last sentence. 8) Boiling water is 220 or
so, oil starts to burn around 300, right? Using a torch you can get the
gear a lot hotter than that. Chill the crank, work fast. Worked for me the
last one I did (I've only done two in my life so what do I know...).
