Subject: Re: How/why did you get your first bus?  

In 1971 a friend of mine bought a dark green 1966 camper from an older
fellow up in Mendocino California.  We both were 19.  He was driving a
mail truck for a living, from Santa Rosa, California, north on 101, across
to the coast on 128, up to Mendocino and back.  He drove me up to
Mendocino one morning, very early morning, and I drove the bus back to
Santa Rosa for him.  

On the way down the coast I picked up an &quot;older&quot; woman of 23 and we hit it
off beyond anything I'd ever managed with a woman.  As shy and socially
inept as I was, regardless of long hair and partying lifestyle, this was
truly amazing for me.  It was with great reluctance we parted, both
knowing our three hours together was but two paths crossing.  I haven't
thought of her in years and years.  My 44 year old heart melts for my
innocent youth.

At any rate, I graduated from college in 1973 and with savings from my
childhood I bought this bus from my friend for $600.  It served me well
for ten years before I let the seats rot to springs, the bed deteriorate
so it could no longer be used as seat or bed, the icebox door be ripped
off its hinges.  The engine blew up and rather than rebuild it for the
fourth time ( I got about 60,000 miles out of the 1300 in it.  I drove it
hard) I sold it for $75 to some dryland farmers living in the hills behind
Hayward.  

Once I get out of school and begin my third career (the first was
hippy/vagabond, the second estimator for pipeline construction company,
the third will be college teacher) I will find another bus to cherish and
maybe, just maybe, will be driving down the road and another love will be
found...
