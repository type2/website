Subject: sub-cultures

I know that we're all a bunch of bus-nuts who eat, drink, and sleep these 
things; but there seems to be a group of people out there who have never 
seen a camper bus, nevermind ride in one.

I just took five people to lunch in my bus, three of which are well old 
enough to remember when air-cooled VWs reigned supreme. Based on the sheer 
awe, and silly (to me) questions - you would think they were riding in a 
space ship. It was as if I had created this thing in the garage, and it was 
the only one of it's kind. The biggest suprise to them all was that I had a 
closet in my van.

They spent the entire ride (20 minutes each way) opening all the doors, 
playing with the sink, and asking where the bathroom is.

This is not the first time I've had this reaction to people seeing the 
camper. When I drove my bug, everyone stopped me with a &quot;I used to have one 
of these&quot; stories. With this, people just seem amazed. Is it my location, 30 
miles East of Atlanta, or are we just the lucky ones?
