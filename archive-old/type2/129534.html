Subject: Re: [T2] Powder coating parts at home??

Would work only if you have 2 circuits in the garage from each side of
the bus bar in the breaker box, which gets 110 to each side and a
neutral.  I'd never advise this but you &quot;could&quot; rewire the box with a
hot to the black, other side of the bus hot to the white, and keep the
ground wire to neutral............but then I doubt you'd have the 30 amp
wiring the stove needs (-*
