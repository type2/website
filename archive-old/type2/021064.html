&gt; Hi everyone.
&gt; I want to thank everyone for their help on my fuel pump woes.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; What was wrong with the fuel pump? I have no idea. Must have just had some
&gt; dried gas in it from sitting (???). But it works now ;) Sometimes you just
&gt; gotta sleep on these things ;)

Eddie:
What has worked for me sometimes is to temporarily reverse the polarity. Two
people helps this procedure. Just switch the wires, have someone up top give
it a jolt and then switch them back.
It's a DC motor and sometimes the pump locks up on something solid like
varnish or grit (I know, the filter should have caught it). So, reverssing the
polarity just makes the pump run backwards, unclogging it.
This has made a non-runner into a runner a couple of times and they both
worked a long while after, so I don't think it was just a last gasp sort of
thing.
