Hi all,

Well, we're getting a little further off topic, but
since some are lauding the virtues of alcohol as car fuel, 
I thought I'd better point out that we currently use a LOT of petroleum
to grow things like corn that we would make the alcohol from.

It's been a few years since I was a grad student in the Institute
for Environmental Studies at the Univ. of WI- Madison, but I remember
much discussion about the proposition of running Americas cars on
domestically produced ethyl alcohol. I forget the particulars, but the 
bottom line was if you also have to produce the alcohol to make the
fertilizers (and pesticides if you want to go that route) and the 
fuel for the agricultural equipment to grow the corn and make the alcohol,
it takes a LOT of land to make enough hootch to run our cars. Like,
it would take most of the ag land we have. Most of the land we currently 
grow FOOD on. And the US has more, better ag land per capita than any nation, 
pretty much, so it really doesn't look like a solution for many other nations. 
It didn't look like a real attractive option for us, and it would
require a LOT of land to be under pretty INTENSIVE agriculture, with all
the attendant environmental problems that causes (soil erosion, water quality
degradation, etc.).

Not to say that domestically produced alcohol for fuel is a completely
hopeless cause, but it's not a cure-all for the petroleum blues, and it
is not a completely clean and green technology.

Back in the '80's (even '70's?), I recall that Brazil embarked on an 
ambitious plan to log off a lot of rainforest and plant it all back to
Eucalyptus forests to compost into (methyl?) alcohol by some industrial
process. They planned to become completely petroleum self sufficient by
(some very short period of time). The whole thing flopped, pretty much,
for a number of reasons.

So SAVOR that beloved Volksie when you drive it. No guilt, just be mindful 
of the environmental impacts of cars. Me, I bike to work and save my Volksie 
for camping and fun. Drive less and enjoy it more. 

Respectfully,
Surfer Bob
