George quoth:

&gt;It's interesting to compare the insight and the bus in terms of economics.
&gt;You can get the insight for about $20K or a nice bus for about $5K  The
&gt;price premium is about $15K for the Insight.  At $2 a gallon, that 15K
&gt;will buy you about 7500 gallons of gas.  At 20MPG, that gas will carry you
&gt;about 150,000 miles.  You can also take along a (literal) ton of stuff or
&gt;six of your closest friends, as opposed to one friend and an overnight
&gt;bag in the Insight.

Well certainly not to jump on the Insight bandwagon but obviously
you aren't being fair George.  You'd have to compare the Insight to
the cost of a new EV (dad's was out the door highly discounted but
still $28,5) new car for new van with all the warranty, features, etc.
The VR6 actually does better than you might expect, turning in 25
on the highway cruising 70-80mph. But the Insight wins that comparison
before it even starts at the sticker.  Yeah the EV carries a lot more
and certainly wins the carpool comparison though.

I don't think gas or diesel hybrids are personally the way of the future
in any respect, but still fair is fair.  However your civic point is well
taken.  I had a '86 CRX Si that would regularly turn 40+, and of course
just straight diesels are good for 40 or a TDI even more driven
conservatively so the Insight is a hell of a premium for an ugly little
car (had to take that one.)  To get the hybrid concept down to zero
is of course going to take hydrogen fuel or just straight electric off
of fuel cells and those are off a good 25+ years either way.  Plus you
still got to make the hydrogen some way the only real zero emission
methods to make electric to make it being nuke or dams and we only
got so much water.

Now to get this back to some real Bus content, did Easterwood or
anyone else ever actually get one of those electric panel van bays
running?  That bus may not win cost comparisons but it is zero
emission.  Has anyone ever seen any of the rest of them that were
quickly and mysteriously snatched up?
