Subject: Hoisting Type 4 engine?

  Looking for some ideas

  I need to help a friend hoist up a Type 4 engine, never done it before.
  Not enough bodies available to just lift it, so what and where are the
  best places and ways to attach and hoist one of these.  It is fuel
  injected and has all parts attached.  I saw what looked like a large tab
  with a hole in it by the oil filler. Is that a strong enough point? Could
  we make a padded hook to go on lip of fan housing after removing the fan?

  Also a variation, I'm considering getting a T4 from a junkyard, this
  place just puts the cars out and you go pull the parts. They put the cars
  up on 2 ft high pedestals.  If I need to  drop a T4 engine out of a bus
  it is too high to put a jack under so would have to attach a hoist
  through the engine door to the top of engine to lower it. Since still
  attached I couldn't use one of the engine/tranny bolt hole so where else
  might be a good spot to attach a hoist on that end?

  Thanks,
  Jeff
