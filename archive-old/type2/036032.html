Subject: Bye! Going to the &quot;other list&quot;

Folks,

The time has come for me to unsubscribe.  I feel kind of odd about 
this, since I've been on the list since, oh, 1994, but I just can't 
justify the traffic into my in box since I don't have an air-cooled 
anymore.

It feels odd saying that: &quot;...don't have an air-cooled...&quot;

Christa and I bought a very nice 1982 diesel Vanagon westy in LA last 
week, and we're very happy with it.  But it ain't air-cooled, so I'm 
gonna have to leave this list.

HUGE thanks to Ken, Steve, Sean, and all the listmiesters and 
contributors to this list.  And to Gerry from way back, too.  This 
list has been a great resource, has helped me keep my buses on the 
road, and helped us bring cool people together to do cool stuff, like 
the Inuvik trip a few years ago.

I also would like to say this list has to be the best run, most 
useful, and most fun list on the 'net.  I know Hoop had a big role in 
setting the foundations to making it that way, but many others have 
helped and all of the list members have kept it happening through 
their contributions, openness, and civility.

I'll still be around, and hope to keep bumping in to list folk on the 
'net, at meets, and on the road.  I've got my Type2_at_type2_dot_com sticker 
on the back of my diesel, just to keep those vanagon list water 
pumpers on their toes!

Thanks everyone, drive safe, and happy camping!

T.
