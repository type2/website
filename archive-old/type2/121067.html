&gt;Even if you have a fire extinguisher when that baby catches on fire the idea

People have suggested before, and I know it's what i'll do if my bus 
ever lights up, that you spray the fire extinguisher down the air scoops 
on the side of the bus.  Works even better if you have two people, one 
to spray, and the other to cover the other scoop with a blanket so air 
can't get in that way.  You essentially suffocate the flame that way.  I 
also carry two extinguishers, so i can then open the engine compartment 
and use the second one if needed.
