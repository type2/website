 Hi,

&gt; ... It is a speedo from a later
&gt; van ... Question: was the gearing different in later years, I'm sure
&gt; that the speedo reads slightly lower ? 

 Nope, the speedo cable is a direct drive from the front wheel, and the
size was the same, at least for all the radial tyred busses. There
should be a number below the middle of the speedo hub that gives the 
number of revolutions per mile (825).
 I expect the lower reading is just measurement error: the speedo wasn't
a precision instrument even 25 years ago, when it was new.

&gt; ... so called the breakdown
&gt; people. ...

 Out of interest: which breakdown people? I'm wondering which company to
go with next (six choices in the UK) and this doesn't seem like much of
a recommendation!

&gt;   .... Last night I fitted a new BOSH belt - it didn't need any shims
&gt; in the pulley, are newer belts slightly longer ? Why is it &quot;toothed&quot;
&gt; instead of a true V ? Belt bought from a VW specialist (Autocavan).

 Hmm, curious: I would have hoped that a new belt would be short,
the toothing needn't be a problem as the belts are generic: there is
probably an application that uses the same size belt but needs the
teeth. Are you sure it's a Bosch 905mm belt?

&gt; All looked OK, I had stopped instantly so no overheat problems here.
&gt; How long can you travel without a fanbelt ?

 About the length of a piece of string. This particular string, however,
is longer in very cold weather, stretches when you stop a lot and is
very expensive when it breaks...
 In your situation the string might have been able to reach a layby where
it would be safe to work on the engine, if you let it cool down
frequently and for long periods.

&gt;  Finally put the bumper on. .... Both Irons are the same. Is
&gt; this correct ?

 Dunno, sorry.

&gt; Upshot is that Ashley now works OK &amp; I will NEVER take him to Sutton
&gt; Coldfield !!!  :-)

 Wouldn't be high on my list of destinations, anyway... :-)

Cheers,
	W.
