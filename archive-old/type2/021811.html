Subject: Re: [T2] hydraulic valve adjustment

There's a long article in the type2 archive that I just read that it
says it makes no difference to adjust them hot or cold.  You may want to
check it out...

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/000c01be5b5b$8a32f720$198166ce_at_default.html

or go to the type2 search and type &quot;hydraulic lifters&quot; and it's the
first article.

&gt; &gt; Should my next (and hopefully final) valve adjustment be on a cold or warm
&gt; &gt; engine?
&gt; 
&gt; cold engine
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Should I now use the 1/4 to 1/2 turn in after contact with valve setting or
&gt; &gt; should I use Bentley's 2 full turns in?
&gt; 
&gt; I use 1.5 turns figureing that when I pull the nut down tight it wil give
&gt; it up to an extra .5 or so turn, so when finished I have 1.5-2 turns in.
