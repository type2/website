&lt;&lt; Whoa, you cannot run your carb on that FI fuel pump. WAY tooo much 
pressure. You need to replace it with one that puts out about 2 1/2 psi. &gt;&gt;

Easiest solution is to use a stock mechanical one.  It won't require custom 
installation, no need for a pressure regulator, no need to route wiring or 
figure out how to get a relay into the circuit.

Its too bad you are you losing your fuel injection.  It is by far the most 
efficient way to get the best possible performance from your bus.  
Dual carbs are the next best thing; 
A single carb with no manifold pre-heat comes in a distant third.  Its 
basically the cheapest way to get a bus going when the throttle shafts on the 
stock carbs wear to the point that they need rebushing and rebuilding.
