Subject: More On Westy (sink) Water Pumps

Hello All!
   I found out today that the water pump on my sink has died too. Mine is a '76, pump that was there is a &quot;Handi-Pump #5000&quot; made by Rand-Tek Inc in N. Hollywood Ca. It screws into the bottom of the plastic water tank, has an in-line fuse holder on the side. Is this the original pump? Ron, is this the one (or equivalant) that you sell? I need one ASAP!  Thanks, Jeff
