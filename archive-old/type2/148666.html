Subject: RE: [T2] 1973 Bus - how to tell which carb is installed?

I've got a 32/36 Weber progressive on my '73 with 2L engine.  You can check
the Haynes Weber rebuild manual which has pictures to identify yours.  If
you can post a picture online I might be able to help you identify it.  

You DEFINITELY want to fix anything that might be leaking fuel.  That's NOT
normal. Check the clamps on the hoses of the fuel lines to the carb.  And if
you haven't replaced the fuel hoses in the past couple years, then that's
something you should do as well.
