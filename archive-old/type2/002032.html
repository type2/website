I do not know much about them but if you are in the PNW you owe it to your
self to check with Northwest Connecting Rod, their is not a finer engine
builder in the area in my and many others opinion.

Northwest Connecting Rod Service
1705 South 93rd Street, Seattle, WA 98108
(206) 763-2487

Good luck and I hope this helps.
Shawn

Hello all,

I am looking at having to replace a tired 1600dp engine in my '70 westy soon
and am exploring my options.  I hope to not spend more than about 1000 or
1200 for a long block.  I know / have heard enough to stay away from GEX!
Has anybody out there had experience with Strictly Foreign?  They are within
a days drive of me and are offering a 1641cc long block outright for 1300.
Is there anyone else out there, preferably in the NW who is reputable &amp;
offering a solid $1000 long block??

Thanks,

David
'70 Westy
