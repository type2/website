Subject: Siding Door is falling apart

I was shutting my sliding door this weekend when I heard what sounded 
like a quarter hit the ground. I looked down to find out what fell 
and saw a roller from the inside track. Does anyone know if I can get 
replacement rollers (I looked around but cant seem to figure which 
part it would be)? I havent opened it yet to check it out because I 
only found out this morn to get the cover off, so here might be more 
damage than I am aware of. Oh also the lock, the one that keeps the 
door open when opened all the way, isnt working too. I figured it was 
a cause of the roller missing, or the door off alignment?

thanks.
todd.
