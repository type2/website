Subject: Project westfalia

Hi again, Another question and some info for you.
First, check you local news stand there is a magazine called VW custom
and Classic, they are jsut staring up again after going out of business
one year ago.  They are now going to publish quaterly.  Their first
issue is out and it is packed with tech articles from their previous
publications.  I found it a pretty good read, so if you want check it
out.

Second, I've been trying to get a copy of Dune buggies and Hot VW's
series called project westfalia.  Is spans approximatel 8-10 issues and
covers the restoration of a westy, including engine mods, suspension
mods, and general restoration tips.  They published it around 1989, and
I've seen it referenced on a web page.  Does anyone know what I'm
talking about, are you willing to share or sell?

Thanks
Chad Granger
