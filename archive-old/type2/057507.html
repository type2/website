Subject: westy window seals

Dear List members.
                            About six months ago i asked the list if
anyone knew where i can sourse the inside rubber seals for the louvered
windows on my 73 westy.In October im coming over to Nothern California
for a holiday and would really like to be able to purchase these and
take them back to the uk.I seem to recall a reply stating that West
Coast Metric might be selling these items soon any more info?
              The seals im talking about can be seen in bodywork section
of the Bently manual.
                                    Thanks for any info in advance,
                                                Jim Stevens 1973 Westy.
