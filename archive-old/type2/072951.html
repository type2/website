OK Folks, I am in South Georgia and bored silly.  I am the only person in
this sleepy but serenly quiet little hometown of mine that drives a VW bus.
I don't like to talk about busses all the damn time but I enjoy chatting
with others who do.  Sort of a certain class of individual if ya know what
I mean.

point your MIRC or Ircle program to irc.type2_dot_com, # buslist and let's
shoot the bull a while.

Hell if ya get tired of it all ya gotta do is leave.  : )

You only live roughly 75 years, so have as much fun as you can even when
things are tough.  Enjoy life's expedition!
