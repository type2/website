Seattle isn't the third or fourth largest city in the US.  It can't be.
I'm sure of it.  More like 7th or 8th, at the highest.  Only a half of a

Anyone have a way to get the heater ducting on a '74 after the exhaust has
been put on?  I'm talking about the part that goes from the flexible
heater tube that leaves the fan and connects to the exhaust/heat
exchanger.  I put my exhaust on and figured I 'd mess with the heat later,
but it's now later and I'm getting cold...

PS I'd like to do this without taking the exhaust off, and I can't seem to
be able to.
