Subject: Electrical overhaul.

First, thanks to all who helped with suggestions for recovering my
window-repair fiasco.  It turned out not to be such a fiasco after all,
and both front and rear windows are now snugly fitted and appear
watertight.

Before I bought it, the bus had been standing for a couple of years
unused in a garden.  Mostly it runs OK.  Amongst other things I need to
get round to, there are a few electrical problems.

I'm not au fait with car electrics, and not entirely comfortable.  I
understand that the real solution is for me to get that knowledge by
reading and working on it, but any pointers I can get in nthe meantime
are most appreciated.

1) the sidelights sometimes work, sometimes don't
2) the dip beams sometimes work, sometimes don't
3) the reversing lights don't work at all (it's a '73 1700 auto, BTW)
4) the right taillight no longer works
5) the generator light sometimes glows faintly at low revs.

I've checked the very obvious -- the bulbs are all intact, the fuses are
present and correct, there aren't any loose wires flapping about.  Well,
actually, there's one under the tranny that I thought was the reverse
light but that was because I used to have a manual tranny Beetle.  In
cases where lights stop working, it's always because there's no current
to the bulb contacts.

Is it worth me doing a minor or major overhaul of the electrical
system?  I was thinking of starting at one end of the bus and just doing
stuff like cleaning connectors up with wire wool, checking for frayed
cable, dab of grease here and there.  Is it worth me doing the job
proper and replacing parts or all of the wiring loom, or should I just
play it by ear and start small?  I'm in no hurry to spend money on
rebuilding the alternator if half of these things can be put down to
resistances in cables and poor connections.

Any advice, places to start, things to check appreciated.

Cheers,

Chris.
