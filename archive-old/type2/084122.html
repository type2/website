Subject: No compression, weird valve

So, the valve closest to the front of the bus on cyl. 1 is quite 
strange.  I found that it could not be adjusted, because i could take 
the adjuster all the way out, and the valve was still pressed tight 
against the rocker.  I removed the rockers and that valve is out farther 
than the other one, by a 1/4 inch or so, at least.  So, i'm going to 
drop the engine to remove the head and see what's going on with that. 
 Has anyone else had this problem?  I'd hate to pull the engine if i 
don't have to.  
It's a 2000cc FI, solid lifters.  
Thanks,
