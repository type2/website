Subject: Mix at altitude- AFM sensor?

In response to post to Don re using scuba tank to inject &quot;oxygen&quot; :

Nah- scuba gear has air, not oxygen alone!  Now a tank from an 
oxy-acetylene torch is another story.....Advance your timing and/or lean 
the mix.......

now you FI experts -if
it is fuel injection, my Bentley (or VW service manual)showed an 
altitude compensator (sold in high
altitude towns?) found in the air flow meter that lets the brain see an
adjusted measurement of air flow- Now since the only thing the brain can
&quot;see&quot; is a resistance measurement from the AFM and all it can really 
control is the amount of fuel injected, and since the air at altitude
has less oxygen, I'd assume it must lean out the jetted pulses to
produce the right mix in the intake??  Thus I assume one could make 
their own &quot;in
line&quot; resistor- qu is, do you increase the resistance or decrease it?
I'm not sure- as more air flows through and the more the vane opens, 
does the resistance go up or down?  Don Tuleja wrote:


Crap! I just sold all my scuba gear!!!

 &gt;Since you are on the cost now it would be a great time to rent or buy a
scuba tank and take some Oxygen with you. Run a small diameter line into 
one of the vacuum lines and......
