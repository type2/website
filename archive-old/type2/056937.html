Hi Brayn,
[...]
As Mark said -- backfire sounds like classic muffler air leaks.  Can you
describe your muffler (bug, type2 stock, header?) and general
description (rusty, holes, not mounted well).

As for screaming 50 in tranny... do you have a tach?  Even your
tach/dwell meter?  What RPM are you doing at 50?  Are you sure it is the
tranny?  Pop the tranny in neutral at 50, does the noise stay?

My '71 bus does 65+ fine...

I just purchased a 71 Westy, and I have a few questions.  The engine
runs pretty good, except that I get a lot of sputtering and back-firing
upon decelleration.  When I let off the gas while slowing down, the
engine sputters and pops.  What can I do to correct this?

Another thing I've noticed is how high the final drive is.  When I hit
about 50 in 4th, the engine is just screaming.  It feels like it needs a
5th gear.  I have never had this problem with a type I/II engine before.
What is up?

Thanks for your help,

Bryan
