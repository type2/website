Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] BMW, Get a hint VWoA

Germany had a program going for many years to destroy old VWs prior to
the early.  When I was trying to get my 72 beetle inspected in Germany
the inspector told me that the stringent requirements made it almost
impossible to get a VW passed.  He also said that the inspectors were
encouraged to especially tough on old VWs in an attempt to get them off
the road.  Luckily, he said, the German government ahs realized that the
old VWs are a very intricate part of their heritage and should be
preserved rather than destroyed.

Mark my words: VW will start &quot;supporting&quot; the vintage market in 10
years, after most of the aftermarket is gone, and they finally
&quot;re-discover&quot; their heritage. This will be after they realize the damage
they've done to themselves, and it's too late.
