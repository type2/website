Subject: Re: [T2] Ball Joints

The only barrier to doing this one yourself, IMHO, is access to a press. 
If you don't want to go buy a press, do everything yourself short of 
pressing in the new joints, have a service garage press in the new 
joints for you, and then finish the job.

That being said, I won't lie and say this was the easiest thing I've 
ever done, just that I've done it myself successfully. I went out and 
bought a press, but I also will likely use it repeatedly.
