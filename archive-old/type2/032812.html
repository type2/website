Subject: Oil temp sender installation

Guten abend, y'all .. 

I'm preparing to add an oil temp gauge/sender to my bus.  The directions call
for a 9/16&quot; diameter hole to be drilled in the oil pan plate to accomodate the
sender.  I'm a wee bit leery of drilling holes in the oil reservoir - so far
the bus isn't a leaker and I'd like to keep her that way.  Is there a
non-invasive way/place to install the sender and still have it provide accurate
data?  Thanks again.
