Subject: Re: diagnostic plug - can one measure compression test?

Since batteries are all different, a voltage drop would not be as useful 
as the actual current draw by the starter system?  And what of when 
things are cold (hard to move engine internals) vs hot (easier to move 
internals?)  Ex VW mechanics should weigh in on this one.

  One feature I want to understand is how VW dealers used it to
  measure compression. Apparently this was done by measuring the
  electrical load whilst cranking the starter. Anyone have any ideas? I am
  working on the theory they compared the battery voltage with no load and
  then whilst cranking the starter. Perhaps they disabled the ignition? My
  guess is that a 'tight' engine would be more difficult to turn, meaning
  a bigger voltage drop when starting. At my next service I plan to
  measure the voltage drop which the spark plugs out (no compression, I
  hope), and then repeat with the plugs in to see if there is a
  difference. Then I'll try and calibrate with a compression tester.
