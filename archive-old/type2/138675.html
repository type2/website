Subject: Re: [T2] The full report (long)

I would never take my older VW to a VW Dealer for work. I tried this about 8 
years ago with my first AC VW '69 Squareback. They couldn't even diagnose 
the problem! This was in Charlotte, NC.

&gt;Well, try living in South Carolina.

&gt;Luckily, we have some Full Moon Bus people down here, otherwise we'd be
&gt;mostly on our own.

&gt;I called the local VW dealer to inquire about getting some minor work
&gt;done, and they pretty much said they won't work on our old bus.
