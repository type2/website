Subject: Re: woodruff key on crankshaft - 76ish type 4

All you have to do is find a key that fits the crank, and then put it
in a vise and carefully file down the top half to fit the fan hub. You
can even make the whole thing from scratch, if you have to -- the tang
end of a file is good material for that. 
   Or you could get a key that fits the crank and then take the hub to a
machine shop and have them cut the keyway to fit -- I'd suggest filing
that too, but it's harder to keep the shoulders 90 degrees.
   Or what the heck, braze that sucker on. 8-)
But make sure it's on right, or your timing will be off -- I know, I
just burnt the heads out of a new rebuild because the key sheared.
