Subject: Looking for a '76-'79 Westy Deluxe

Hey All,
It's been a while since I've been on the list cuz I ran out of time to
work on the bus :(

But now I'm back and I'm in search of another bus.  My original
intention was to fix up the bus that I have now (an orange '76 westy). 
Well.. I took all the interior, stove, and other goodies out.... and
it's all still out.. a year later.. being used as furniture in my apt..
(extremely low budget furniture)

And it's probably going to stay in there because the bench works quite
well as my kitchen table seat and the sink/stove combo is my speaker
stand in my bedroom.. and no, I don't have a girlfriend in case you were
wondering...

and not having a radio for a year sucks big time.  Yeah, you don't need
the interior for the tuner, but you do need door panels for speakers :)

SO!  I am now in search of a green Post February '76 Westy Deluxe.  I
really don't want to deal with the rust/paint problems on my current bus
so I'd like to buy another one in better condition.  Plus, I REALLY want
a GREEN one.  I had a green one before the orange one, and it rusted
away to bus heaven and having another green one would make me extremely
happy! (I'm sure I could deal with another color..)

If anyone's got one for sale or knows someone that's selling or a place
to find one that's being sold, please let me know!  I just went throught
he type2 listing and emailed a buncha people so I'll see if I get any
replies.

I've worked alot on '76s.  I don't think I'd like to drop down below
'76, but I may be willing to go up to '79.  If I'm correct, that was the
last year before the box style.. yes?  I'd like to stick with the
original bus style and have fuel injection.

I live in Long Beach, CA, but I'd be willing to travel a little to get a
bus in excellent condition.  I am looking for one with very minimal rust
and with the interior intact.  Hopefully I'm not asking for too much ;)

That's 'bout it.  If anyone's got any leads, send 'em my way.

Thanks!!
Mike Soultanian
