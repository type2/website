&gt; I contend that a FI bus should not start much less run with the AFM
&gt; unplugged and the two FI buses I've had would not start or run with the

well one more experience, with my 78 it will start with great difficulty,
run very rough, but cannot increase RPM for any reason, will immeadiately
stall out
