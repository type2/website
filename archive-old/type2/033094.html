Subject: Haynes manual

Hallo everybody,
  The other day i went to my local Pep Boy's, and got the Haynes manual.  I 
have a 79, 2 litre FI engine that is all stock. The cover says...  &quot;VW 
Transporter  1700/1800/2000   1972 thru 1979 All Models.&quot;  My only problem is 
that when i got home and opened it up, there was nothing about fuel 
injection. It's got  a lot of drawings, pictures, and information that i can 
still use for other areas, but my only concern is if i have a starting or 
stalling problem, i wont be able to refer to it.  Is there a haynes that 
covers my FI system, or should i keep this for what its worth and get a 
Bently?

Matt O.
