&lt;&lt; But it is 21cc liquid cooled!  How many mopeds are liquid cooled?  

Judging by the feedback, the seller buys things cheap and then sells them on
eBay, there were numerous comments about the seller not knowing what she is
selling.  (I say she as one of her comments were about just delivering a
baby, or maybe she's a stork) I doubt that she has even driven the bus much.
I've emailed to find out the story of the bus, but haven't received a reply.

Air or liquid cooled, 21 cc is only enough to turn the alternator...
The KEP (Kennedy Engineered Products) decal on the engine lid
is a tip off that the engine's been changed...Among the many 
problems in stuffing a water pumper into the VW van has been
placement of the radiator and plumbing it...A stock water pump
isn't gonna be able to move enough water laterally with the rad-
iator mounted up front. You're gonna hafta &quot;engineer&quot; something 
from scratch that'll keep the water moving without leaking or de-
veloping air locks...A front mounted engine close to the radiator
uses the thermosiphon effect with the water pump to boost its
effectiveness. The radiator fan is most useful at low speeds or
traffic to help the radiator to keep the engine from overheating...
