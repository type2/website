&gt; &gt; i was reinstalling my push rod tubes (72 westy, stock engine) and i
stripped
&gt; &gt; one of the bolts that holds the rocker arm to the head, Bently lists it
as
&gt; &gt; quality 6 G. Does this mean i cant go to a local hard ware store and buy
a
&gt; &gt; new bolt? Do i have to go to the dealer?
&gt;
&gt; Home Depot has grade-8 metric bolts, as do some FLAPS. If you've got a
&gt; Grainger in your area and they'll sell to you (they only sell to
&gt; businesses), they've got Grade 8 bolts too. Also try the local Caterpillar
&gt; dealer. There are six grades of bolts out there--grade 2 through grade 8,
&gt; though it's uncommon to see grades 4 or 7. If you're dealing with a headed
&gt; bolt and not a stud, look at the head for little radial marks. Grade 2
&gt; doesn't have any. Grade 3 has one, grade 4 has two, grade 5 three, you get
&gt; the idea.

Whoa, stop.....this is only true for SAE bolts. Metric bolts use a
completely different system. They are marked with numbers. The weakest being
8.8. They go up to 9.8 then 10.9, 12.9, and 14.9.
