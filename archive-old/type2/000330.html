&gt; p.s...who's got'dem westy cabinet handles


Repros are apparantly a couple of weeks away.  Will include the handle,
button, pushrod, and lever but not the latch section that mounts inside the
cabinet door.  First time available in quite a while. Projected price
roughly $7 each.  I should have a first-run sample within a week.  I'll keep
you all posted.
