I'm planning (hoping actually) that my engine will finally go in. (2.0
F.I. in Vanagon - hydraulic lifters) what is the recommended procedure
for the first start-up?
(please p-mail me since I'm in list mode)

Appreciate any advice - BTW thanks to this list for all the help I
received when firing out questions during the uncertain times when
re-building.  And congrats to Tom Young for doing two engines! Way to go
Tom!
