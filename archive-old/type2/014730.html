Skip the puller, hit the thing with a hammer. I have spent 10 years doing
brake jobs and never used a puller. Get a very large hammer and smack it
squarely. That will break the rust loose. The problem with pullers is, the
center of the drum is stamped steel, it is rusted to the hub, you can pull
hard enough with a puller to bent the center of the drum. It will be a paper
weight after that. When useing the hammer, you must hit it at the hub, knock
the studs out first if needed so you do not destroy them.

Subject: [T2] Brake Drum Puller...


I attempted to change the shoes on my bus for the first time this weekend, 
and could not get the drum off. Here's the situation:
1977 Transporter, with the drums that have two crews in the front, and two 
holes for moving the adjusting stars at around 6 o'clock, and one hole at 
around 1:30 for looking at the lining on the shoe. The bottom two holes for 
the stars were missing the rubber covers for I don't know how long. After 
much WD-40 and liquid-wrench, I was able to get the rear star to move and 
backed the shoe away from the drum as far as I could. However I could not 
get the other start to move at all, (and I have succeeded in bending that 
hole into a rather non-circular shape) and I can not get the drum off.

So I searched through the archives about this issue and came up with 
several references to hitting it with a hammer and using a brake
drum puller. I decided that a puller would probably help me get the darn 
drum off, so I called several FLAPS and got the same response from all: 
&quot;There is no such thing! You might be able to find a gear puller big 
enough, but we don't have one.&quot; What gives? Does such a device really 
exist, and if so where would I go to get one? Any other advice on how to 
get that star to move? Should I try to manufacture a puller, and if so 
where should I start?

Thanks for any help,
-Nick
