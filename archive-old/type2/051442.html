Subject: [T2] Rear wheel Noise.

What's up?I've got a question, I've got a 68 Westy and I hear a noise
almost like a slight scraping, when I'm coasting in nuetral going 5 mph
or so and the noise doesn't go away when I step on the brakes.I lifted
the back end and the grabbed the wheel and it has a little play when I
rock it top to bottom. Is that ok?
Thanks for any help.
Casey
