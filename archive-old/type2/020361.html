sorry to be ambiguous, for a 74 and up with the rack in the front the
seal should be a real seal i don't know about the earlier ones i have
forgotten the setup on my old 73
happy new year to come
jamie
&quot;I also just replaced the seal on my luggage
rack with the &quot;not so real&quot; seal. The original seal was not a seal
either.
Now for what is confusing me is that the rack is not supposed to be
sealed&quot;
