Subject: Re: [T2] another trouble first engine pull

Hi Ian,

Before putting the jack under the engine I like to check around the 
perimeter of the engine tin and make sure that everything that crosses 
from the body to the motor is ID'd and disconnected. If you do it this 
way you will also catch stuff that isn't in the manual, like wiring for 
CHT gauges and other aftermarked modifications.

There may be a few things you have missed that aren't mentioned in your 
message:

- Fuel line (one line on a carb'd bus, 2 on an FI bus.
- Brake Vacuum Hose (Drivers side front tin, 71-79 only)

As Bob said, removing the coil, the oil filler tube and the rear tin is 
also recommended.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Thanks for the great responses!

&gt; Since i'd started taking the engine out alone yesterday (w.out trans.) 
&gt; I decided to continue on that route today.  However, after receiving 
&gt; guidance from the list and getting all four (!) bolts out, I'm having 
&gt; trouble disconnecting the engine from the trans.  You know, the ol' 
&gt; jiggle and push.  Are there any tips or tricks out there?
&gt;
&gt; I'm just gonna eat some lunch and then try again.  Right now I figure 
&gt; I've been too gentle.  I've got two scissors jacks under a piece of 
&gt; wood under the engine jacked up a little bit to put slight pressure on 
&gt; the engine.  Then I pushed the van forward and moved the wheel blocks 
&gt; up.  I've wriggled and pulled with all my might, but it still won't 
&gt; come.
&gt;
&gt; So far I've disconnected the 4 bolts, electrical, the two hoses from 
&gt; the heat boxes, the accel. cable, and taken everything unnecessary off 
&gt; inside the engine bay.  Am I missing anything big?
&gt;
&gt; Whew.  Off to some soup.
