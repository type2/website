Subject: Re: [T2] distributor compatability

[...]
Compufire (in their own manuals) does not sell a  unit for the buses or 
vanagons series vac advance distr.  Had a salesman here also try to 
sell me one but i got suspicious about the wording and called a shop 
that looked it up and stated right out that it was pertronix only.  
picked  one up that weekend at the RMMW show and its been running great.
