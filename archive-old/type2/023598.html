Subject: 3 Speakers; 1 Ground Wire???
Message-ID: &lt;5f5357dc.252a60e2_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Re-Greetings*  (No, sir George Lyle, I do *not* know how the speakers go! :)

  After much ado, Ramona's new 8track stereo is mostly installed! I would 
rather wrestle ole Jesse Ventura than go at it with the fuse block again. 
That really sucked.
  However! I even managed to hook up the wire that allows the digital clock 
to keep time while the cars off! (It, of course, remains to be seen whether 
or not the battery's dead tomorrow morning...)
  Okay, so, I thought that hooking up the speakers would be the easy part. 
Why do I always do that? Yeah, so, it's not, at least according to me.
  There are wires coming from the harness to support 4 speakers; left front, 
right front, left rear, right rear, BUT! there is only the ONE ground wire! 
How do you use just one ground wire to travel to each speaker? I hooked just 
the one under dash speaker up to test the stereo sound (gotta brief 
smattering of &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me&quot;, and I smiled.), but I can't 
live with just that one! It's the original and doesn't give much.
  Plus, there are only 3 speakers (one front, two back)...does that matter?
  Anyhow, if someone could let me know how I go about using just the one 
ground wire for all the speakers, I'd be ever so obliged. I'd really like to 
have some tunes on the way to work tomorrow, and I wanna get this done before 
my Super Bowl-Bound Miami Dolphins (Go, Dan!!) whup up on some Buffalo Butt 
on Monday Night Football!
  Have we told you lately that we love you all? Well, we do, big, big, and 
surely appreciate any ideas you might have for us!
Thanks*

wiring!
