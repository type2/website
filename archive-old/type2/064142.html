Subject: Re: CB antennea location?

        CB antennae? Mine is mounted in the same place as the radio antenna, just on the opposite side (thanx to the PO).  Works pretty well, available at Wal-Mart.  My friend has a gutter-mount antenna that also works well.  It, however, doesn't warrant cutting holes in your Bus.  Probably the coolest type, though (IMHO) is the combination CB/AM/FM antenna.  Hide that CB/scanner!  Available from J.C. Whipme.  Usual Disclaimers.
