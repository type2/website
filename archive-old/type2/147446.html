Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pump gear length ?

on oil pump sizing, be careful.

a lot of bug shops sell oversized pumps. 
IMHO the pump gear size is not critical.
as long as the pump fits in the case
what IS critical is the drive dog length
there are short and long ones
corresponding to &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;dished&quot; cam gears
IIRC aftermarket cam gears are &quot;flat&quot;
not sure what you need for stock 71 cam
but before install compare new oil pump to what you have

another issue is that some &quot;filter-pumps&quot; may not clear your mustache bar
make sure you get one that fits

also, you need to match pump to the 4 studs that it mounts to.
there are small (early) and larger (late) studs. (6 vs 8 mm??)
also small (early) and larger (late) pump outlet hole

I have a Berg full flow pump cover (normal pump outlet is plugged)
with the special angled fitting to clear mustache bar.

good luck,
Will A.
