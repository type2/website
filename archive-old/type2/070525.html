Subject: '79 fuel pressure update - trip report - wheel bearings
Message-Id: &lt;&quot;991004191812Z.WT27088.  0*/PN=Brian.S.Hoare/OU=C367320/OU=SLLN/O=McDonnell Douglas/PRMD=MDC/ADMD=TELEMAIL/C=US/&quot;_at_MHS&gt;

Still have a complete loss of fuel pressure shortly after engine shutdown.
I decided to blow it off and go camping anyways for the first time since
last Thanksgiving (work killed any and all plans for the past year...pht!)
After a few test drives around the neighbor hood and a 90 mile commute to
work and back, I had enough confidence (and spare parts) to commit to a
camping trip. 

My front wheel bearing did sound kind of bad on Friday, its amazing what
you start to notice after a little sound proofing has been installed in
ones bus. I had a set of new bearings, so I decided to replace the outer
bearings on both front wheels. Has anyone come up with a way to remove
the inner races without going to a shop? An examination of the old
bearings revealed that the rollers did not turn freely by hand and the
right outermost bearing had a lot of pitting.

We put 500 miles on the bus driving from Dana Point, CA to McGrath State
Beach in Ventura for the night. Didn't see any busses in the campground.
We went to the Avocado festival in Carpenteria and bought a couple of
tie-dye shirts. There is a guy there every year that has the best looking
shirts that I have come across, nice and bright with excellent patterns.
We also went up to Santa Babara where I used to live, there is a really
great playground there which my 3 yr old loves. We stopped in at the
Cajun Kitchen for breakfast (my favorite place). Nothin like firey hot
links in your eggs to get you going in the morning. My three year old
slept in the child's hammock for the first time. Thanks to Charlie Ford
for selling the hammock to me, and to my sister-in-law who picked it
up in St. Louis and finally mailed it. I owed my sister-in-law $180 for
a family trip we took to Arkansas, and had to hold that check hostage
to get her down to the post office with my hammock. My 1 year old slept
behind the rear seat so he couldn't roll anywhere.

The bus ran pretty good for the trip. It did hesitate a bit as I
accelerated onto the freeway Sunday morning after only 5 minutes
driving, but I assume it was just clearing its throat. I got 22 mph
on 2 tanks of gas, so my fuel pressure problem doesn't seem to be
affecting my mileage. The bus ran about 220F when I kept it below
65 mph, but the temp creaped up to 240F when I tried to cruise at
70 mph. I also hit 250F going up the 101 freeway grade from Camarillo
to Thousand Oaks (3rd gear 40 mph). Not too bad for a tired old engine
with 180K miles and 90,110,90,110 compression. Limping along until
Xmas for a new engine and trans.
