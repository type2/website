Subject: Chugging engine at cold startup and then hard starts when
  engine is warm??

This new single port engine with a 31pict?? (whatever is stock on them) chugs like it's over choking first thing in the mornings. Takes a few good revs to help &quot;clear&quot; it. After it is fully warmed up and you come back to start it again (say you went to the mall and came back in 5 minutes to the parked car) It is hard to start, just cranks and cranks and then fires up on what seems like about 2-3 cylinders. Then if revved a couple of time it clears and idles ok. Any thoughts on this?? Compression is good right across the board. 1600 sp stock engine.

Thanks, Courtney
