Subject: air deflectors for 8mm studs

I''m stealing parts from an old 1600 DP engine to build a new one based on
a  universal case which has the 8mm head studs.

The air deflectors which fit underneath the cylinders were made to fit the
10 mm studs and are a loose fit on the 8mm studs.

Can I use my old deflectors with the smaller studs?   Do I just bend them
until they are a spring-fit against the new studs?

Jack
