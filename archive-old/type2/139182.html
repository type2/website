Subject: Re: [T2] 1978, window crank failed

  Well, i can understand the rant and agree that quality parts is better 
parts, whether new, used, or NOS. Personally I got sick of trying to 
find a non-stripped regulator in the local yards and kicked down (what 
I've now found was about twice what I prolly should have) for the new 
one to get the window up and the winter winds off what's left of my 
thinning hair. Time constraints came to bear on my decision more than 
anything else on this one. Suffice it to say, it pays to shop around 
and ask volks who know whenever possible. That said, sometimes ya gotta 
do what ya gotta do to get the job done. This too is one of the reasons 
some of us have veedubs, they're quite often amicable to the quick fix 
in a pinch.

&gt; I have had some bad feedback on new (from where) regulator quality. 
&gt; Allot of time the stuff that is available new is, well, just plan 
&gt; crap.
&gt; RANT TIME (if you cannot stand the heat stay out of the kitchen) 
&gt; you've been warned.
