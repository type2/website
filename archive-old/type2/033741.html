You do not want to sand those lines off if you want your rings to seal

I'm assuming that what Berg does is what anyone can do, With new p&amp;c's or 
reringing old p&amp;c's you need to do 2 things.
1 run a ball hone thru each cyl. This will leave a crosshatch pattern (those 
little lines you see) they should not be straight, but kinda a all over x 
pattern.
To do this you need a drill. right size ball hone and solvent.

2 When your all done those puppies need to be clean, really clean,
first with solvent to get the big chunks and then with detergent (like dish 
soap) this is why guys work late at night, so we can use the kitchen sink 
without getting caught!

3 dry them off, compressed air works best and if your not going to use them 
right away, spray them with wd40 and bag em
