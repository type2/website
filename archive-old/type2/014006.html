Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure extension hose

Its just a simple way to run dual senders.
My sender for the VDO doesn't have the idiot light so I kept the old
sender and put it on a T connection.
But I've been wrong all morning about the 1/8&quot; NTP threads and the wire
gauge for rear speakers, I plan on being adversarial all day about my
opinions. Remember KISS, *Keep it simple stupid*.

I don't understand the need for any extension.  On my Vanagon, I
installed 
 the  gauge/idiot light sender straight into the block.
