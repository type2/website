Subject: 140 k on bus engine?

&gt;140k on a Bus motor? You, sir, have impeccable car care skills.&lt;

I don't think this is all that unusual on original engines.  I rebuilt my
stock '79 calif. engine at 142k due to dropped valve seat.  All original
engine and heads.  I was the third owner and my bus spent the first 90k
doing mostly city driving in San Francisco.  I'm not sure how well it was
taken care of, but it was stock when I got it, which might be an indication
that it was maintained by someone who cared.

Buddy of mine is running his '78 with original engine/heads at around 145
k, but engine is probably going to be rebuilt soon due to oil leaks.  I
believe his bus was well cared for, as his parents bought it new.

Do I expect to get 142 k out of my rebuilt AVP?  Probably not.
Particularly not the heads. No slam on AVP here.   So far, everything is
fine after 10k, but something just makes me think that welded heads aren't
gonna hold up like new heads, and a volume rebuilder isn't going to have
the same quality control as the factory.  Particularly at the price I paid
for the rebuild.

Just my thoughts.
