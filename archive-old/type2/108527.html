Subject: Re: [T2] Carb Mixture

&gt; What is the correct mixture on the carb...,,,.?

&gt; i read the bently and it says 2 and a half but i am not exact;y
understanding how to get that from the point i am in now and dont want to go
turning anytihing until i know for sure,...
&gt;

    The true carburetor adjustment should be done with a CO% machine, at
14.7 parts air to 1 parts fuel at sea level, or the factory required % of
air/fuel. Same holds for any carb one, two, four barrel, single or multi
carb's. There is no &quot;book&quot; screw &quot;turns&quot; setting for the air/fuel mixture
setting, other than a base setting starting point.
    Ok I know everyone doesn't have a CO machine, so......with the engine in
good mechanical condition, at operating temperature, all electrical
consumers &quot;off&quot; (A/C, Headlamps, rear window defroster, etc, etc.), all
other base adjustments correct (timing, dwell, valves,
etc.)........automatic choke open, air filter in place.......hook a tach up,
set the idle to factory spec (925 rpm's ?).......with the air/fuel screw set
at the described &quot;TWO TURN'S OUT&quot; (THIS IS A BASE SETTING ONLY)........turn
the air/fuel mixture screw very slowly &quot;IN&quot; until the engine RPM'S just
begin fall off, and the engine runs slightly rough........at that point
begin to turn the screw &quot;OUT&quot; until the rpm's reach their highest point and
the engine is smooth........re-adjust the idle speed to book spec. (925
rpm's ?)...........Walla good to go!
    After you have done this a few times you will learn to &quot;hear&quot; the engine
fall off and idle rough and be able to set everything (except the actual
idle speed of course) without the tach.
    You have to remember no two engines have the exact same idle properties,
so any &quot;book&quot; air fuel adjustment spec (two turns out etc.) is a base
setting only.
    Anyway until you save those green stamps up and buy your four gas CO%
machine $4000.00 to $5000.00 for a good Sun machine, this should get you
idling good enough!
