Subject: Pushrod/Lifter (update)
Date: Tue, 15 May 2001 22:33:27 -0400 (EDT)

List-
In my last note I said the pushrod seemed to be gone. I removed the rockers
and reached into the tube with a grabber tool. The pushrod was there, in
far enough to be out of sight and was in perfect shape.
So, the valve and spring are fine, the rocker and adjustment screw are
fine, the push rod is fine. This leaves the lifter and the cam. Is it
possible that the lifter collapsed?  It is a &quot;solid&quot; lifter (not hydraulic)
but I think they are hollow. What could have happened to the cam? I will
try and pull the pushrod tube out tomorrow and the lifter if I can.
More later,
