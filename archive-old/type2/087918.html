Subject: Generator has rough spot - fix or replace?

I've noticed that my bus's generator doesn't spin freely: there's a
rough spot where something inside is rubbing gently and audibly against
something else.  This happens at the same point on each revolution of
the shaft.  Is this a simple matter of lubrication, or an indication
that I need a new generator?  I never noticed a problem before I took it
off the engine, but I can't imagine it would be healthy to put the thing
back in its current condition.
 
Any advice?
 
Thanks,
 
- Miles
