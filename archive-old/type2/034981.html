Subject: Re: In car head removal, '77?

the head can be removed while the engine is in the
bus.  i have done it when time and lack of adequate
facilities werent available, however you will bend the
hell out of the engine tin and your fingers etc.  it
is certainly not the correct or pretty way to do it. 
that said if you have the facilities to yank that
engine i would recommend it, otherwise get out the
diinfectant for those cuts:)
