&gt; im not sure about using &quot;the pink stuff&quot;....id be afraid of moisture getting 
&gt; in between the sheet metal and the insulation and rusting (the way carpet 
&gt; can do to floor pans)

I think when I redo my 68 interior I will insulate with regular R6 or so
but I plan on sealinf th einsulation in plastic bags. Ive seen it done
this way in studios it also helps keep the glass fibers from getting loose
on yyyou  (itch)
