    Now was that the &quot;rear main seal&quot; as listed in the catalogs and by VW, or
the fan pulley end crand seal? It definitely sounds like the latter is the
problem.


&gt; Viton seals, oil pressure switch replaced.
&gt;
&gt; I think it might be coming out of the Breather Tube because the top fitting
&gt; always seems to be soaked with oil... also the dipstick always seems to be
&gt; slipping out. Might this be piston blow-by getting into the crankcase and
&gt; causing the oil to squirt out of the dipstick tube and crankcase breather
&gt; tube?
&gt;

      Certainly must have blow-by if the dipstick is blowing out. You might
check to see if the breather is clogged -- hose kinked. Disconnect the
breather hose from the throttle housing end and blow *into* the crankcase to
make sure it's clear. If you just replaced the fan end crank seal, then what
is happening is the pressure in the crankcase is blowing it back out. One
other thing to check is the fan hub that goes into the seal -- it might have a
groove worn in it. But sounds like blowby.
      Sounds exactly like my '81 was doing. PITA!!!
