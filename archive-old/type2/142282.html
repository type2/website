Subject: RE: [T2] pop top hole in 73 bus

The reason I ask is because I have a ceiling mounted AC blower unit in
storage. I looked in my bus and it looked like it would not fit. I was looking
at units on The Samba and someone is selling a ceiling mounted unit that came
from a 78. I think mine was made for a 78 also, but I assumed it was for a
non-pop top. Maybe I can still use it? Anyone got any ideas? It would be much
nicer to use this one and not have to find a good under dash unit.
