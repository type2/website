Subject: Is Les Schwab still selling their Jupiter tire?

Just wondering if Les Schwab is still selling their Load Range D tire for our
Westies? I believe it was called a Jupiter? Also known as a Signet, WooSung,
and something else. I believe they were excellent value at the 55-65 dollar
range? I tried to look on their web page, but it is useless, and we don't have
Les up here in Canaduh. But we DO have a 1.07 dollar right now, which makes a
trip to the states look very very tasty. :-)
Thanks,
Courtney
