Hey,

I'm new to the VW Bus world and need to know a few things.  A friend of mine
just gave me a 71' VW Bus.  I want to know how to find the engine and
transmission &quot;type&quot;.  The only reason I'm unsure is the engine looks like
it's had a lot of work done (aftermarket).  Is there anywhere I can
cross-ref engine block numbers?  Also, does anyone know if an
auto-transmission will work in a 71' Bus (I hate commuter traffic!)?
Lastly, are there any good VW shops in the CA, Bay Area (I live in San
Jose)?

Thanks for indulging my newbie-izim!
