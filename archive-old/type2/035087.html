Subject: Low Rumble in 71 1600

I have a 71 camper with 1600.  This started with squeak from the generator 
and a blowout of the Generator and a belt wrapped around the pully. tow  to 
the mechanic to put in a new generator.  He replaced the pulley(cover that 
goes over the shims) put on a new belt and new generator.

Anyhow drives real nice.  Now when it starts up there is a low rumble that 
was not there before.  Idles alright it but the rumble quiets down after it 
warms up.  this makes me think it is not just something loose like a tin cuz 
that would vibrate regardless if the engine is warm or not.

but when you drive you feel that low rumble in your butt when your driving. 
It vibrates the whole bus so the sink and table and everything is just 
rattling from the vibration.   Could it be from the generator or new pulley, 
or is this the sound from loose heads.

Would a compression check tell me if my heads are loose??

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
