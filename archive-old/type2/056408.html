Greetings all...

I just hooked up my horn in my bus, after the previous owner had done some
wacky wiring that rendered it mute.  However, whenever I turn on the
ignition, the damn horn goes off.  I pulled the horn button and checked
the ground (good, clean connection) and the horn ring seems to be fine.
Is there a connection at the bottom of the steering column that I should
look at?  I am now driving around with the horn disconnected to avoid
sounding like a fire engine...

Also, I'm going to install my oil temp gauge this week and am running a
red and black wire (12 gauge) from the sender (dipstick) to the gauge.
However, I was wondering how I should wire the gauge light?  Any thoughts
on this?

Thanks.
