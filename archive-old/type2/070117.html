I believe that a Sawzall  ( sp? )  is the best.   It might be hard to use in 
tight spots, but with a metal blade, you can make nice even cuts, even 
curved  ones.   They aren't all that cheap though.   I think that Sawzall is 
a brand name, and though there  may be other brands  out there, this is also 
used as the generic term. ( like Xerox)
Anyone agree/disagree?

Hi folks,

I'm about to cut a hole in my bus &lt;shudder--cringe&gt; for some recirculating
air duct for my gas heater.  I have to make some curved and straight cuts
and I'd like to do this as neatly as possible.  What is the best 110v tool
(no air compressor) to cut sheetmetal cleanly?  Would a Dremmel tool work on
sheetmetal or is that used for thinner/softer metals?  I've seen air
nibblers that look like they can cut a nice curve, but haven't chanced into
any electric nibblers--do these exist?

I could just use the drill/metal hand saw/grinder method for this, but I see
metal cutting in my future.  When I look through the Harbor Freight and
other tool catalogs it's difficult to tell by looking at the pictures and
the short descriptions which electric tool would be the ideal buy for auto
sheetmetal cutting.

Thanks,
Ron
