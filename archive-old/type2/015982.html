Happy friday!!!

 I have been catching up on the list this morning and reading Doktor Tim's
rantning. Seems to me that whatever a person carries spare parts or not is
a personel choice.
I have three vehicles and the only one I keep spares for is my bus. Why
only the bus you ask? Because it is 25 years old, 175k miles, and an
unknown history for the engine. I have been pretty anal about regular
maintenance, don't drive it beyond its limits, and basically baby it. Even
with all of that, it has left me stranded twice...once because the coil
went out (a new one at that!!), and once when a plug vibrated loose. I had
the spare coil, still in use today, and I had the spark plug in my spares
box. 10 minutes down time on both break downs and I was on my way. 

 When I bought this bus, it was 210 miles from home. I inspected what I
thought was the nessary things and made it back with no problems other than
oil blowing everywhere. When I got it home, and started cleaning up the oil
mess, I thought about everything I would replace and keep as spares. As you
can see, I needed the spare part to keep the journey going...and that is
with constant maintenance!!!! 

 Moral of this story??  Because one makes a living working on vehicles
doesn't mean they should berate those that don't!!!!

 Stepping down from the soapbox!!!
