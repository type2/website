i like the idea of putting an aftermarket cd player/tuner in the glove box.  
there is no way i would remove my still working blaupunkt 8 track from the 
dash spot.  i get a huge grin everytime i'm digging on a little &quot;grateful 
dead&quot;  and look down and see a 8 track player.  but do not worry i'm not real 
far behind the times.... i do have one of those giant 8 track to cassette 
adaptors.
