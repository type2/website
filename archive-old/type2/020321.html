Subject: Plans for Camper Conversion

I posted this question before but only got recommendations for buying
something or how to put a shell on the top so here it is again: I have a
a 70 transporter and would like to build some cabinets, sink, fridge
etc. and maybe some other modifications to use it as a camper: I saw a
site a few months ago, (at first it looked like a parts place, but then
went into detail on how to build cabinets and etc.) but now I can't find
it. anyone heard of this site or any site where I could find plans?
Thank you guys so much

Dok
