Subject: Re: rumor mill

Same goes for a type 3 engine which I have on my dune buggy. But is should
be noted that you can only keep driving AS LONG AS YOUR BATTERY WILL HOLD
OUT. So if this does happen it's a good idea to stop cranking the stereo,
turn off lights and fans, etc.

&gt;Of course, if you get out and verify that your fan is still turning and the

&gt;belt has simply broken, then you can keep going.  Happened to me once and I

&gt;was very happy to have a type IV engine... that day.  :-)
