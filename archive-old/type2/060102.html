Subject: [F] Type2 Halloween costumes?

Hi gang,

Here's a seasonally scary thought we might want to bounce around on the list:

If you are going to a Halloween party, what possible &quot;Type2&quot; costume ideas
could we all come up with?  Gotta be Type2-relevant ideas, or else
Listmeister Steve will have my head (Bwahahaha!)

Some of my ideas so far:
------------------------
- A thrown rod (scary)
- A VW dealership mechanic (very scary)
- Happy stoner &quot;organic mechanic&quot; (not scary, usually)
- A water cooled radiat*r (dry ice under rad cap to &quot;boil over&quot;)
- A leaky oil cooler (same idea, but with goopy stuff &quot;leaking&quot;)
- A road: black clothes with yellow stripe, potential for signs such
  as &quot;soft shoulder&quot;, &quot;slow children&quot; (always a favourite of mine), or for
  the more risque, &quot;bump&quot;, &quot;slippery when wet&quot;, &quot;one way do not enter&quot;...
-Tie-died, long-hair, stinky dead-head patchouli boy (requires equally
 stinky dog)
-One big piece of hopelessly rusted metal (with VW symbol on front)

Other ideas?

Happy Halloween, and slow down for the kiddies!

Tobin
