I looked at a 78 Westy for sale the other day here in Denver, CO.  It is in
fair condition.  Heres a rundown on it if anyone is interested:

Interior:  Its all there, with a couple strips of trim missing.  Everything
supposedly works.  The sliding door panel is worn.  The cabinets look to be
in good shape.  The carpet can use replacing.  The fabric in the seats looks
pretty good, didn't notice any tears.  The passenger seat has been replaced
with a seat out of an american car - lind of wierd.

Exterior:  Pop top in good shape, might be one small tear but thats it.
Small areas of surface rust from road dings and some around the rear end of
the gutter.  A couple of dents but no major damage.

Underneath:  Looks very solid, minimal rust.  Great car to fix up.

Engine:  Recently had major work done on it and has not driven it since.  On
startup, it makes a lot of noise that sounds like lifters need to build up.
Owner claims the valves need to be adjusted, but that doesn't make sense
since it should be hydraulic lifters.  Crank seal also leaks.  There is some
rust in the battery trays - no surprise - but nothing major.

The owner is in a hurry to get rid of it.  He is asking $1500 OBO.  He is
getting desperate to move it, as is parked at his ex-wife's house and she is
about to move and he can't drive it because of the engine noise.  Right
about now, a low ball offer would probably get it.

If anyone is interested, I have a few pictures of it that I will pass on to
you.  I have no connection to the owner and have pretty much told you what I
know.  If you have other questions, feel free to ask.  I'd hate to see this
go to a junkyard because he can't find a buyer.
