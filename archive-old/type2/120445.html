Subject: RE: Parts from Brazil

My experience with Brazilian parts have been rather.. well mixed. The
quality certainly seems to be there, but it doesn't seem like particular
items fit all that well. I don't claim that's because of poor
craftsmanship, but I think it has to do with manufacturing changes (I
guess?). 

Take for example, the last item I bought from Brazil. It was a pair of
amber colored front turn signal lenses for the 72 and up I think? (not
the small ones for the years by the front bumper). Never the less, the
lenses did fit, and the screws did fit, but I pretty much had to put the
screws in at a slight angle in order to tighten the lenses down. I
normally would not have done this, but the plastic light bulb harness
behind it was pretty much worn out anyway, and I figured I would just
replace it one of these days.

Then, I got the Brazilian replacement tail-lamp assemblies, and they
didn't fit exactly like the originals did. With a little struggle, I got
them in. 

Another example, the door weather stripping... I'm not sure what is
different about the busses there, but the weather stripping I have
doesn't fit all that well, actually, the weatherstripping seems to be
thicker than the originals. :\
