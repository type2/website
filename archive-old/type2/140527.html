Subject: Speakers in front kick panels:??

Someone on the list told me they had mounted round 6&quot; speakers into their
front kick panels in their Bay westy, and I'd like to do the same, but damn me
if I can figure where you'd have the room. Does anyone have pics or a
suggestion where to put the speakers? I may have to go to surface mounts or
else cut the door panels.
Thanks,
Courtney
