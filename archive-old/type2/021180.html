I would think that there are some draw backs to storing and engine full of
oil....
it'll leak!  You'll neglect to check it.... you'll have to store it in a place
that probably is a hostile environment for part of the year, 

I guess it depends on your ability, but I would disassemble the engine down to
the case,,treat everything using a product Like LPs 3 rust inhibitor which
sprays on like WD40,, bag and tag all the part individually 
and store them in a closet inside somewhere. With the tags facing out! 
Warning,Time capsule! do not open unless in a T4 engine emergency,,, 

At least when you go to assemble it, you know what years of storage has done to
things,, you don't have to worry,, has corrosion developed on the cylinder
walls... is the cam dry and pitted, are the seals brittle and cracking,, 

Rather than filling an entire engine with oil and putting up with that mess...
 then finding out after neglecting to look at it for 5 years... that all the oil
has drained and the insides are like corn flakes 


If I had to grab an assembled engine off the shelf in 10 years,, I would
wonder,, then take it apart to find out for sure,, cause it wouldn't be worth
the time to install and run it to find out it had cylinder wall rust  ,,just on
the top side when the oil level had gone down

From experience,, rust and mice get in everywhere.  
YMMV
