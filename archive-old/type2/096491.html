Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cooler Cleaning?

I doubt that cleaning out the oil cooler will provide you with lower oil 
temps. Your temps are most likely rising due to engine wear. 

What's more oil coolers are particularly hard to get clean on the inside
due to all the nooks and cranys. These nooks and crannys also act as
something of a filter for larger metal particulates, which, as I said, are
hard to get out. This is why a good engine builder will use a new oil
cooler when they do a rebuild. No sense trashing a good engine with metal
flakes from the old one. They are just too hard to get clean. There is a
company that does it right somewhere in the archives, but it is pretty
pricey.

Have you checked compression lately on your engine? I would go over the 
mechanicals, and make sure all the tin is sealing properly before trying 
to clean out the oil cooler. If you are really convinced that the oil 
cooler is the problem then I would replace it with a new one instead of 
trying to clean it.
