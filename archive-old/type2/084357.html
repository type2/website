Subject: Tip for lining up bolts (re alternator frustration)

Sean, I read your tech article on alternator replacement.  Haven't had
to do it yet, but I do have a spare (and I'll check on getting a boot). 
Re your seeking a tip for the frustration of lining up a bolt, I usually
try to use a &quot;drift&quot; to line up the in between stuff and then use it to
guide the bolt, sliding out the drift as the bolt goes in.  If blind and
frustrating, I'd try drilling a small hole in the center of the bolt
end, and then make a drift with a small tip (like a bicycle spoke, which
is 14 or 15 gauge stiff steel with threads), and temporarily stick it in
there with superglue after the bolt is initially positioned.  I had a
similar frustration with getting the thermostat cable up through the tin
from below, and used suck a trick, first threading a brass wire through
from above, and soldering it to the end of the cable (you can tell I'm
also a bicycle mechanic).  Another handy tool is this thing shaped like
a pencil (about 1/4&quot; wide) with little grippers that come out and expand
when you push the end.  Good for little bolts.  Also have that screw
gripper that has a center that rotates under spring tension to hold a
screw or anything with a slot.  Cool tool that really holds, perfect for
starting a distributor screw.
