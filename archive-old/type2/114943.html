Subject: Re: [T2] replacing lifters

Hi,

As long as they continue to properly pump up after 20 minutes, I'd vote 
for &quot;Not&quot;.

My dad has hydraulics on both his Vanagons and they do the same thing 
if they sit for more than a week. After 20 minutes they're fine.

Happy trails,

&gt; Recently theres been discussion around lifter noise. I have pulled my 
&gt; engine
&gt; for a clutch issue, but also had lifter noise after allowing engine to 
&gt; sit for
&gt; two weeks. After 20 minutes it went away...the bleed down period seems 
&gt; to be
&gt; normal if engine hasn't run in awhile. Question is...now that my 
&gt; engine is
&gt; out...should I go thru the trouble of replacing lifters? Recommended 
&gt; or Not?
