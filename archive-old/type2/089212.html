Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

&gt; No key start up on my T2 (77) is not difficult. One clip on jumper wire
and
&gt; a screw driver to short between starter pins 30 and 50.
&gt;
&gt; I can't see how a hidden ignition switch would help.
&gt;
Not really a hidden ignition switch.. the ignition switch itself would
remain exactly in place. But this would be an auxilliary switch with a trick
thermistor that goes open, placed in series and hidden anywhere in the
circuit. For one thing, it would not be expected, and by the time the thief
realized that he had a problem, he would not know what it was or what to do
about it..He might try to restart it, but after a second time around, I
think he'd give up. It's a little different when you are in the middle of a
street somewhere with a stalled vehicle, trying to figure out what to do,
and wondering if a cop or some dudes with baseball bats would show up. At
that point, most thieves would walk away from the vehicle as fast as they
could. I wouldn't even mind getting a notice from the police impound yard to
pick up my vehicle if it kept it from getting stolen or possibly stripped.
In fact, knowing how it would behave, that's the first place I would look
for it.
Yes, I suppose that a thief could run a hot lead to the coil and so on.. But
there is nothing you can do to prevent a car from being stolen. All you can
do is slow them down, and usually that is enough. If they think that the car
will hot wire and drive normally, they will do their standard bit and drive
away with it. When it keeps dying on them, they have to deal with it in a
possibly incongenial environment, like the middle of a street near to where
they stole it.
