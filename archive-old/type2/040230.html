Subject: More on Mystery Noise

Sounds similar to a problem we had on a mega-road trip.  Our thought when the noise appeared was a bad right rear wheel bearing.  We spent a day in Redding, CA tearing the right rear apart.  Nothing wrong with the bearings--turned out all the noise was from the axle nut being loose!  This turned out to be a recurring problem on that trip.  What we have since come to believe was the cause:  cheap Brazilian brake rotors, poorly machined, slightly out of round causes slight vibration which loosens nut; others have reported similar problems with these rotors.
