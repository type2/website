Question and comment.

Comment, 1st:
I removed the black cardboard rectangles from above my 1600SP engine and
replaced them with cut to size sections of the aluminum backed felt (space
stuff) I got from JC Whitney.
I glued the space felt in with simple spray adhesive, aluminized side
facing the engine.
I then installed cut to size pieces of aluminum sheet stock against this
material, and bent the holding tabs to keep it in place.

Next, I cut a section of the space stuff to fit as a bed liner under my
sleeping area. I bordered the cuts with duct tape, and laid the material
in, shiny side up. (Just as done with house insulation for best vapor
barrier results) On top of this, I place an old cotton mesh weave blanket
as an additional sandwich material.

WOW !! What a difference in sound reduction................ Big Time !!

Question(s):
When applying this Kool Koat stuff on the interior surfaces of your bus
outer walls, are you addressing the possible need for condensation
weepage/drainage, and does the Kool Koat stink up the bus with any asphalt
type stench during the hot Summer months?
