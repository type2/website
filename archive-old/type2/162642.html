Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for an engine- AVP?

If you want to best engine, IMHO, get one from Boston Bob (aka Boston
Engine). They come very highly recommended. See them at:
http://www.bostonengine_dot_com/

As always, you get what you pay for.

I don't have any experience with AVP. And, you're right, stay away from
GEX!!!

Jon

&gt; Can anyone offer some thoughts on AVP?  Others I should consider?  I
&gt; am fully aware of GEX, so that should cut down on some of the email :-)
