Subject: Re: [T2] solenoid and starter check

Sounds like you are on the right track - be sure you don't get run over by 
the vehicle when you bridge the terminals on the starter.

Somebody posted an article where a bus owner did just that!!!

Helper, bus in neutral, foot on brake, foot on clutch.

&gt;So my 71 westy decided to not start yesterday, so I push started it and it 
&gt;drove home just fine, but this morning it just clicks when I turn it over 
&gt;so I thought I would check the solenoid and starter today but wanted to 
&gt;make sure I do it right. so.....
&gt;1. Check all wires and contacts
&gt;2. ignition off, bus in neutral screwdriver across the 2 large contacts on 
&gt;the solenoid?  It whirls then starter is ok? If not starter is problem?
&gt;3. Screwdriver between battery contact on solenoid and to terminal to 
&gt;ignition?  It whirls then solenoid is bad?
