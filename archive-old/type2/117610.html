  bustow a Geo   Metro?

Don't forget however....Roadcow may have claim to fame in the bigger 
engine, but...

how about the brakes?????
how about the handling???

Yep, I've got tires that will go well on the snow and ice....but they
still can't stop well on ice.

Btw, I have towed bugs a lot with my 67 split..no problem if they tracked 
well, but stoping was the important part.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Comparing the Roadcow towing a bus to a stock bus towing a bus (or Geo)
&gt; is like comparing The Rock (the muscular dude in the last Mummy movie)

&gt; Comparing calf to calf, the Roadcow has become a Bull!

&gt; &gt; Enough of the scare stories.  Britt Grannis (remember Britt?) has hauled

&gt; &gt; if I'd recognize Roadcow without another bus hooked to the ass end. It
&gt; &gt; can be done. Just keep your thinking cap on and realize that you're
&gt; &gt; going to wear your bus out faster.
