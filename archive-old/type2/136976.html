Subject: The first commandment of VW machinists

&quot;Thou shalt have no other machinists before me.&quot;

Getting engine work done by more than one VW machinist is not 
recommended. There's a tendency -- I am guilty of it, or was -- to 
think of someone who does serious machine shop work on VWs, like 
rebuilding rods and grinding cranks, as just the guy who owns the 
machines you can't afford. But that's a mistake. If a VW machine shop 
has a good reputation, you are buying their knowledge, expertise, and 
experience, not just time on their machines.

That's where the difficulty lies. Every good VW machinist has his own 
way of doing things. One says that all the gallery plugs should be 
replaced as a matter of good practice. Another looks at your gallery 
plugs, makes a judgment about which ones are iffy, and replaces only 
those. It's a mistake to take the advice of the first to the second. 
One uses brass plugs, another uses aluminum.

Pick one machinist based on reputation and whether he gives you answers 
to questions that you understand, and then trust his judgment.

Says I.

Mark
