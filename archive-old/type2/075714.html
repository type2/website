Subject: Re: [T2] CAD files in the archive idea

We are in the process of setting up CAD drawings for free for those that can
plot them for the birch panels. I have started a webpage for this and
Russell, me and a few others are working on it. It may take some time to get
it 100% done, but here is a rough start:
http://www.72camper_dot_com/panels.htm

There are no files to download as of yet, but the first 2 should be
available real soon. I am always up for adding any CAD files like the parcel
tray to this webpage for free and for anyone to use. I can plot them and
ship them out too. I do not intend to make any money from this ever. I added
info for shipping, but not sure on the cost. Probably only a few bucks to
send a tube through the mail. The files on the webpage can be .dwg files for
CAD people or .plt plot files for non-CAD people.

&gt; &gt; My concept is to just standardize on the fairly ubiquitous .pdf file for
&gt; &gt; uploads to the archive.  Anybody can download them and print them out,
they
&gt; &gt; can't be changed (makes us designer types sleep better), and it's a
&gt; &gt; reasonably efficient file format.
&gt;
&gt; I would suggest creating plot files as well. for things like panel
&gt; patterns the user can send the plot file to a plot house w/out any cad
&gt; experience and have prints made on large format paper.
