Subject: Re: [T2] Oil strainer (not filter) for 76 bus

Just to clarify, there are 2 different plates that come off the bottom
of a pancake engine. One near the oil filler (called the oil sump
cover) the other in the middle of the engine w/ a nut that holds it in
the middle. Make sure you are looking in the right place first. The
middle of the engine. If you remove the nut the plate should come off.
the screen looks kinda like a sifting device.
