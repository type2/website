Subject: charging problem

Hi--may not help but I had warning light come on a while back on a trip from 
Scotland and this was caused by fuse blown  ...i think number 11 for the 
generator warning light and indicators. Replaced fuse and way. OK for 400 
miles.... the next week, the same thing happened and OK when I replaced the 
fuse. Since this happened when I turned the signal indicator , I figured this 
might be connected, so I replaced the relay (behind the fuse box) and 2 years 
later, the problem has not reoccurred. Mine is a 75 with a type 1 motor so 
fuses are a bit different from yours... just a thought anyway. Otherwise, I 
agree it sounds like the regulator.
cheers
