Subject: 2l idle circuit

Hey ho,
	My 2l 1980 bus wasn't well after running out of fuel. Backfires and no idle. I took the carbs off and cleaned them, which cured the backfire, but when trying 
to get the baby to idle, I heard a lot of air wooshing out of the l.h carb. Traced it to a hole (meant to be there) (I put my finger over it - problem cured). Found a little cap 
lying on the tinware underneath. Put the cap in the hole - fits like a glove. Idles beautifully, until it pops out. I've got it held in with a U clamp at the moment. The manual 
makes no reference - How should it be held in?
