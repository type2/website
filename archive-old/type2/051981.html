Howdy, all.

The old Blitzkrieg (temporarily Sitzkrieg) would fall somewhere in between B and C.  &quot;71 Westy, with original everything in good shape incl. child's cot, curtains, mosquito nets, etc., but has a couple of rust spots in front of the rear wheels-getting fixed soon.  She's up on stands getting new brakes, shocks, windshield, and rebuilt engine-look out.  Once she rolls, off to the body/paint shop for transformation into a real A/B creature.

Until then,

Blake
'71 Westy
&quot;Blitzkrieg
temporarily 
&quot;Sitzkrieg&quot;
