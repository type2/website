Wade:

I know these nuts get re-used all the time.  I would guess the thinking 
here is: you don't want anything going wrong inside the case, especially 
something as simple and cheap as nuts.  Also, I believe that some earlier 
versions of the Type IV engine had you peen the nuts to the connecting 
rods to make sure they didn't come loose.  If you re-use these nuts the 
peened portion of the nut's going to cut into its seating surface of the 
connecting rod, possibly gouging off small metal flakes.

I got my new nuts from Bus Depot.

&gt; 	Quick and hopefully easy question here.  In the process of my

&gt; &quot;An important part of VW connecting rod service is replacing the rod nuts.
&gt; _Always use new rod nuts_ for maximum strength and accurate torque

&gt; 	The book we're using is &quot;How to Rebuild You VW Air-Cooled Engine&quot;,

&gt; 
&gt; 	We never would have replaced them, and are wondering if it is
&gt; really necessary.  And if it is necessary, does anyone know where we can
&gt; get the nuts for a 1974, Type 4, 1800cc engine?
