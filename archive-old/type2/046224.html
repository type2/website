Subject: [T2] Oil fill plug on steering box?
Content-Disposition: Inline

Hay everyone!

     My steering box on my 79' bus has a slow leak, so I want to fill
it, but can't find the oil filler spot. Nothing in the library, or
archives, and in my bentley it does not show one. So where is it? does
it have one? I really don't want to pull it out to fill it. Any info
welcomed!
Thanks, 
Shawn Reed
