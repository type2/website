  The window repair piece for the bay window from Scholfield is more then
likely made in Brazil or Europe (not by him). He did buy all the stock from
VANG when they went out of bussiness.

Thanks.

&gt;  The 3 piece windshield repair you were/are looking for can be made by any
&gt;metal fab shop for less money then Schofields.

What's a good price for this item? Schofield want $39US.  Can I really get
parts and labour for less than this?

&gt;  There are good and fair pieces made by many companies and I would suggest
&gt;talking to someone www.metwiz_dot_com that has pretty much tried EVERYONE'S
&gt;metal repair pieces and can tell you who has the best.

Metwiz sells a repair part but only for splits. I'll ask then what they have
to say. FYI...

http://www.metwiz_dot_com/parts/002_0220.jp

&gt;  There are also a lot of independents here in the U S that are also making
&gt;repair parts.

Can you recommend any?
