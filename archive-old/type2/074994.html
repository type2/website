Subject: Seat Swap

Happy New Year, All.
I am looking at some nice seats out of an 84 Vanagon for possible
installation into my 74 Riviera day camper. I know they won't fit on the
mounts, but will they fit otherwise? My 74 has a floor-to-ceiling closet
behind the driver and the partition behind the passenger. Will these
interfere with the 84 seats. They are high-backed and have armrests.
Thoughts?

Thanks
Dave
