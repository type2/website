Well, it would be a little like changing your oil and dumping the used
stuff in your toilet.  It *is* out of sight, but it has hardly
disappeared.  I ain't the most environmentally correct person, but I know
that pretty much whatever you do, engine drippings, dirty kerosene, old
grease, etc. are a mess from an environmental standpoint.  I would love to
hear what the best/worst cases for disposal are.  I have always been leery
even of using the spray-on, wash-off engine degreasers, as I live less
than a mile from a major tributary to the Chesapeake Bay, and I *know*
that is where the storm sewer goes.  At the same time, EC or not, there is
no way I can think of to collect it.  

I have a feeling that the best way to clean cases may be to take them to a
shop where you can hope the cleaners are reused to uselessness and
rerefined.  OTOH, the last time I did an engine pull, the thing was so
filthy I went to have it steam cleaned first.  Made the mistake of asking
about the process.  First they spray it wiht a TSP solution, let it sit a
while and then hit it with the steam jet.  Where does the run off go? 
Down the storm drain....  AAARRGGGHH!!!!
