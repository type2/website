Subject: Re: [T2] Highway Speed Oil Pressure

I'm not wanting to start a long comparison but what kind of miles are on
your engine? 


Bill M.
&gt; Dont know who posted that but it depends on the rpm of  the engine  at
the time.  At  hot idle i  have 11 to 15, at  about 3k about 25psi, and
at about  4k about 35 psi
