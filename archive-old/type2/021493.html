Craig:
I'd get a second opinion on the alignment. Also, are you running the correct
inflation difference?
I think the door jamb and owners' manual shows  40 rear and 34 front. It
definitely helps to have less air in the front than the rear.
Mine usually drive pretty nice and I've never replaced THAT many parts!

options seem

&gt; to be front torsion arm needle bearings (which supposedly NVER go bad if
&gt; kept greased) and the rubber bushings in the rear trailing arm mounts.
&gt;
&gt; suggestions appreciated.
