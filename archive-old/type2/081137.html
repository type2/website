Subject: Re: [T2] Lower L/H Ball Joint Removal (?) 

Sorry, I forgot you didn't already know what is was thinking...  I would
follow Bentley.  I wouldn't heat the trailing arm.  I would remove the arm
myself (did a couple weeks ago).  I would try to remove it myself
(unsuccessfully).  I would take it with the new joint to a place that knows
what their doing.

Good luck,
Bill

&gt; Bill,
&gt;
&gt; I'm curious - which part wouldn't you do? Heat the trailing arm? Do the
job yourself? Follow the Bentley procedure?
&gt;
&gt; I do agree with you on not cutting corners on suspension or brakes, but
I'm not sure what you're saying regarding the connection between any of the
above and the safety of your loved ones. Can you expound a bit?

&gt; (2)I wouldn't, that is where the majority of the vehicle weight rides.  I

&gt; loved ones make whatever money saved seem pretty insignificant should they
&gt; get hurt.
&gt; &gt; (2) If I need to replace, is it true that it's not necessary to follow
the
&gt; &gt; Bentley procedure?  Has anyone tried to heat it up (as mentioned in the
&gt; &gt; Library) and then whack it out?  Can I do this job for the first time by
&gt; &gt; myself?  Do I need the press as per book?
