&gt; After I posted the first message I went back out and tried it again. After
&gt; setting
&gt; the dwell (adjusting the gap, tightening the screw, then turning it over
&gt; again to see if it changed) I checked and I couldn't move the points by
&gt; pushing with a screw driver. Then I started the Bus and watched the dwell on
&gt; the meter. After a couple minutes I could watch the needle slowly move up
&gt; until it hit about 77 degrees then it quit. I popped the distributor cap
&gt; again and I still couldn't move anything. I don't know if it has anything to
&gt; do with it, but, when I tried to check the timing and it was bouncing all
&gt; over the place. Any Ideas?

Dwell is the amount of time the points are closed, and anything beyond 60
degrees is very iffy as far as getting enough spark to the plugs.

Sounds to me like you need to check out those points.  They sound like
they are stuck.
