Subject: Re: [T2] Front Speaker and cubby hole shelf mockup

&gt; My experience with a shelf in the same location is that it can be a
&gt; kneebanger if extended out as far as your mockup.  You want to keep it
&gt; forward (FIF) of the lower lip of the dash.

I am trying to keep it in the area of the optional shelf, it is 7&quot; tall and 
doesn't come out past the front of the dash, I am over 6' tall but have 
really short legs (can't find shirts that fit) and I have been driving it 
around with the cardboard speaker for 2 days and have yet to have made 
contact, and somehow it hasn't fallen off the dash, which is pretty weird, I 
am trying to live with it for a week before continuing.

&gt; There are quite a few places where you can hang the box.  I hung my shelf
&gt; from the lip of the dash and from existing screws on the air duct.
&gt;
I am going to put in blind 3/8-16 inserts and try to figure out mounts at 
each end and in the middle, the middle looks easy, I plan to come off the 
frame piece that is on each side of the E-brake.

It will probably weigh around 25 pounds before we pile junk in the cubby 
holes.

The design will require a groove in the back for the E-brake to fit in, I 
think this will add a lot of strength.

Thanks for the input.
