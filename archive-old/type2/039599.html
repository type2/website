Phil -

CB Performance sells an external oil pump that fits the rear (RiR) mount and
is thin enough to miss the motor mount. I think Bernie Bergman also sells an
entire kit for that.

You can also get an adapter that fits under the current upright oil cooler,
but that'll require an engine pull.

&gt; I'd like to add a full flow oil filter system to the bus' engine.
&gt; How is this possible, with the 68-70 engine mounting brace in place?
&gt; (I'm guessing it will obstruct the oil feed from the pump).
