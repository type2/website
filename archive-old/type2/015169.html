A couple of recent queries have gone out on the 581 CDI unit that 
Hoover swears by.  They are in the process of &quot;revamping&quot; their
line and have recently put up a website:

http://www.wic_dot_net/~univcorp

they can be e-mailed at:

&lt;univcorp_at_iti2_dot_net&gt;

The site has mostly pictures of the various products but you can e-mail
Eileen Iles for a brochure.  Real nice people.  They first made FAA-approved
aviation equipment (EGT probes) which is how Hoover got to know and like
them (my personal guess)?
