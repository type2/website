Subject: transmission whine

Dear Listees

I have a case of transmission whine.  
I looked at the archive and library - and there's plenty of stuff about
swapping a gearbox et al.
But what I really want to know is...  
How can I find out how serious this problem is (and whether I need a new
gearbox)
- or whether it's only of slight annoyance value.

I'll probably give it some new gear-oil this week-end anyway - so I'll have
a good opportunity to
try a few tests - pulling/pushing/twisting the rear wheels etc...
