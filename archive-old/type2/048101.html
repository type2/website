&gt; Hello all, I'm planning on putting a 77 autotranny into a 74 bus and I have a 
&gt; few questions.  The Bentley manual doesn't cover the late autotranny, does

&gt; before putting it into 74 bus, i.e., new seals, drain transmission oil, etc.? 
&gt;  Is there any thing I should look for to that would give me a hint that this 
&gt; autotransmission is bad.  The PO gave me the line &quot;it was running fine when I 
&gt; parked her there in 1986.&quot;  Will the 77 autotranny work correctly if I'm not 
&gt; running FI but carb?  Has anyone on the list done this switch and If so does 
&gt; anything need modified or retrofitted.  Thanks in advance

oh boy!?

it is easier to switch to an auto tranny than from one to manual, BUT it
still isn't just a drop switch, there are some major differences.  now I
have never owned a 74 but I will guess it is like my old 71 manual, I now
have a 78 auto tranny bus.  some major differences

. flywheel must be changed to flexplate, and I _think_ the crank bolt is
different, the flexplates are all 5bolt rather than one gland nut
(is a 74 a type I or type Iv engine??)
. need to convert clutch to torque convertor
. half shafts are different, you cannot use manual half shafts, AND auto
tranny half shafts are different lengths so there is a left and right side
. shift linkage is different
. accelerator linkage is different, auto tranny accelerator goes to tranny
with rod to engine (so there is kick down and other tranny actions)
. the front tranny mount is different
. the front shifter mount is different
. there is an idle speed &quot;Reducer&quot; on the engine so the engine shifts into
gear easier (frequently missing on many buses)

some parts of the shifter linkages are NLA so be sure to get the parts
from the old bus.

as for &quot;is the tranny any good&quot; well the PO says it has been sitting since
1986, almost 15 years?! auto trannies are more complex so there is more to
stick or fail when sitting for long periods, and there is no way to check
an auto  tranny short of expensive test stand or put into your van.  would
be quite a &quot;bite&quot; to go to all the work to put in the auto tranny then
find out it doesn't work.....is there someone with an auto tranny bus that
would let you put the tranny in thiers to test to see if it works (this
would be a &quot;good&quot; friend)

if you decide to go ahead good luck, what about the condition of the donor
bus could you fix it up rather than switch the trannies????
