Subject: Part needed - engine mounting brackets

I'm looking for a pair of the metal brackets that allow a type IV motor to
be
mounted in a 72-79 bus.  These are the metal brackets that bolt to the case
on
either side of the oil pump via 2 13mm bolts each.  I do not need the rubber
mounts themselves, only the metal brackets.  If you have a pair that you can
part with, please let me know.

Thanks!!
