Subject: Morning Drive

I know it's not Friday, but I just had to say I drove my bus on this 
brisk morning to work, and it felt great. Every minute of theose 2.5 
years of work felt fulfilled in one 12 mile commute under a red sunrise. 
Thank you everyone who helped me over these years, already I can barely 
wait for the next spring's campouts.
Best regards to all
Al
