Subject: Re: screen-as-fabric and magnets

&gt;i was thinking of throwing a screen over the top of my sunroof while
&gt;parked, camping. has anybody fashioned a screen with a magnetic perimeter
&gt;for a similar purpose? how to go about it?  something that can be rolled
&gt;up, folded... - steve

I made myself a complete set of camping screens for about $5. First I 
bought some &quot;no-seeum&quot; netting at the fabric store. It has a very fine mesh 
and won't let in any bugs. Second, cruise your neighborhood looking for 
dead refrigerators. Take a pocketknife and liberate the magnets inside the 
door gasket. Just make a cut at each corner and the magnet should slide out 
if you grab it with needlenose pliers. If you don't want to do that, you 
can buy the magnets at the fabric store sometimes, but each refrigerator 
has about $20 worth of magnets on it. It took two fridges for me to get 
enough magnets to do both front windows and the rear hatch, but I had a 
bunch left over. Figure one fridge for the sunroof. Another for the rear 
hatch if you want to do that.

To create them, just drape the material over the window or roof. Stick the 
magnet to the body. Fold the cloth over the magnet and trim so that you 
have about an inch hanging over. Tape temporarily or staple. I sewed mine 
up on the machine next, but you could glue them or whatever works. A quick 
bead of hot melt would stick to the magnet and cloth really well.

To store you should roll up the screens and store them in a tube. I have an 
old film can mine go in, but you could also cut the magnet into shorter 
pieces and make it easier to fold and stick under the seats or in a drawer.
