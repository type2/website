Subject: Forgive My Ignorance - I'm in VW Kindergarten
Message-ID: &lt;0.386d1e05.253e099d_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

    Well, I finally did it.  I threw caution to the wind and bought my first 
foreign car.  She's a real beauty, too...a light blue 1971 VW Bus...not a 
drop of rust on her.  Picked it up for a quick $250.  Needs interior 
work...and there's no engine or transaxle.  But other than that, it's a 
pretty solid ride.  But it's going to need some work, a lot of work.

    It's actually for my wife.  She's been obsessed with the Bus as long as 
she can remember.  She really wanted a split-window, but I know this one will 
make her just as happy.  I'm going to keep it a secret from her as long as I 
can.  

I've been reading every drop of literature I can get my hands on, and I've 
ordered over $150 in books already.  But there's a lot of things you can't 
find in books, though...one reason I'm glad I found this list... So, in 
preparation for many seemingly idiotic questions that may be coming from me 
in the next few months, I would like to apologize.  I'm starting at ground 
zero here.  I have absolutely no knowledge of VWs and air cooled engines.  
And I am going to try to limit my questions to things that I can't find by 
reading on my own...

Below is a list of questions that I am despirately seeking answers to.  
Please feel free to reply to me directly, so as not to bother the rest of the 
list with my novice questions.  Any help I can get is EXTREMELY appreciated.

1.  What size engine originally came in the 71 Type 2?  From what I can tell, 
I guess it was a 1500 or 1600cc.  Does anyone know what it's horsepower 
rating is?  Max speed, etc.

2.  If I wanted a more powerful engine, what would be the most logical 
choice?  Would all the bus parts still interchange with it?  (I know, I 
know...it's a bus, not a race car...but I'd still like it to have some punch 
to it.  Nothin wrong with that, is there?)

3.  The bus is missing just about every piece of interior trim...  It's naked 
inside.  Can anyone give me a brief description of what's supposed to be 
there?  Where can I get this stuff?  I guess a junkyard would be my best bet. 
 Just wondering if anyone knew of anyplace that specialized in interior 
pieces for the bus.  There must be SOMEONE.

4.  My wife has no clue how to drive a manual.  Of course, she'll learn.  I 
heard a rumor someplace that doesn't SEEM very likely to me, so maybe this 
would be the best place to ask it.  A very unreliable source told me that VW 
had also made automatic transaxles?  I'm not sure how true this rumor is, but 
I've personally never seen one in magazines or catalogs.  Can anyone shed 
some light on this for me?


That seems to be everything I can think of at the moment.  Once again, I'd 
appreciate it if you replied directly to me.  I'd hate to get the reputation 
of &quot;The guy that started that really long thread with the most idiotic of 
questions.&quot;  

Who knows, I may just keep it for myself and give my hot rod to my 
wife...hrmm...I'll have to think about that.
