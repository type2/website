Subject: Brake fluid reservoir tube question

Hi folks:

I discovered a puddle of brake fluid under the master cylinder of the '70
Westy I just bought.  Upon investidation, the leak was from the joint
between the tube coming from the brake fluid reservoir on the kick panel,
and the dual reservior attached to the master cylinder itself.  I tried
tightening the clamp, but no help.  I pulled the plastic tube off of the
reservoir on the master cylinder, and there was a deteriorated rubber seal
of some kind in the end of the plastic tube.

My questions:

Is that rubber thing supposed to be there, or did a previous 'mechanic' rig
it up?

If the rubber thing is correct, does anyone know the part number, and a
source for a new one?  RMMW shows a part which *might* be correct, 211 611
833C, called a 'grommet'.

If the rubber is not correct, how is this joint sealed?

THANKS!

Kabayo
