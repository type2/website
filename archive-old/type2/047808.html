Hi volks,

&gt; There is a difference between a commercial grade tire

 Hmm, clearly there is: I have been confused about this for 
a while but have yet to be able to find definitions of
what these terms actually mean :-(

&gt; I could be wrong here, but I thought the tire design and 
&gt; construction would
&gt; resist the crowning of the center portion up to the maximum 
&gt; inflation pressure.

 You may be right about this but my impression is that it is
not the case. In any event, even if the construction resists
crowning, the contact patch will be smaller since less tyre
area will be required to support the weight of the vehicle 
at the higher pressure.

&gt; Short of locked wheel skids, there should be little 
&gt; difference in braking
&gt; ability.  The maximum braking efficiency is found at the 
&gt; point of impending
&gt; skid. 

 I believe that the point at which the wheel locks will be
earlier with the higher pressure. My reasoning is that the
smaller contact patch will result in there being less rubber
and less tread on the road. It will be at higher pressure
and be more highly stressed. The net result is that the
tyre will lose grip sooner and skid for longer.
 Look at the big tyres and low pressures used on sports or
racing cars: more rubber on the road means more work can
be done by it.

&gt;   In a water on the 
&gt; roadway condition, a
&gt; higher tire pressure will raise the speed at which 
&gt; hydroplaneing will begin. 

 I'll have to take your word for this. I have no reason to
think it is wrong.

 Do you have any information on wet-road performance prior
to aquaplaning- as you point out below this is more important
than dry road grip, except perhaps for braking. I think that
there would be much better grip from a 30psi front tyre than
a 50psi front tyre in wet weather but I havn't experimented,
nor can I cite references or reasoning.

&gt; In
&gt; a turn, which would be the most critical factor in front tire 
&gt; grip, you would
&gt; hear a tire squealing before you reach the limits of adhesion 
&gt; of your tires. 

 That's true, but it may be too late to do anything about it.

&gt; My
&gt; 2.0L Westy does not go fast enough to reach this point.  If 
&gt; it did, I would be
&gt; driving way to fast for the conditions on the roadway.  I 
&gt; have been unabe to
&gt; maintain a 4 wheel drift on a clover leaf freeway ramp with 
&gt; my Westy, no matter
&gt; what the tire pressure.

 In my experience the bus will understeer if pushed hard enough,
though rarely on dry tarmac. 
 I confidently predict that it would be impossible to get a bus
to let go at the rear (on dry tarmac) without vastly more power
than stock. The weight distribution is closer to a 911 than to
a front engined car and you can't get one of those to hang its
tail out without serious abuse or a lot of extra power.
 In a rear engined car the combination of rear mass and weight
shift under acceleration creates a phenomenal amount of traction
at the driven wheels- its easier to get a 911 (or a bus) to spin
by reducing power at the limit than increasing it.

 Anyway- that's getting off topic. I'm sure we all agree that
underinflation is more dangerous than overinflation and I hope
that we are reaching a concensus that pressures close to the VW
recommendations are safest.

&gt; It is, however, a valid concern as to overall tire pressure 
&gt; and vehicle handling
&gt; characteristics.  If you want to try it out, increase the 
&gt; pressure in 5 pound
&gt; increments and see how it feels.

 I would reiterate that, IMHO, increasing tyre pressures will
actually improve &quot;handling&quot; (cornering stability, crosswinds) but
will reduce ultimate grip (emergency braking, unexpectedly tight
corners).

Cheers,
	 W.
