Subject: [T2] need part # for double cab

i need the part number for the gaskets on the rear cab windows. each side,
one being the 3rd door, has a vent window adjacent to a stationary window.
two gaskets are used: one on the vent, another on the stationary glass. i
need part numbers for both, and all four if they are lefts and rights.
there has been mention that the vent rubber is different from the bus
middle window wing vent. numbers would tell all. i'd greatly appreciate
help from those with old part number books or fiche. thank you in advance.
