Tim-

By &quot;Coast&quot; I mean allowing gravity to pull the vehicle down the hill, with 
the gears engaged, and the motor running over at highway speed.

At 60 mph, coasting, the cooling fan is blowing through the heads/cylinders 
at about 3900 rpm. Meanwhile, the injectors are injecting only enough fuel 
for idle speed, and this is burned (or partially burned) in a low oxygen 
environment (throttle closed, rapid intake leave vacuum in cylinder, etc.). 
This abundant volume of cooling air will chill the motor rapidly, with or 
without the thermostat. Do a little reading on the origins of air-cooled 
motors for autos and you'll find this was one of the grand engineering 
difficulties to overcome. During mountain climbing in winter temperatures, 
the motor would cycle from its highest operating temps (450+), to its 
lowest (&lt;100) in short time, then climb again.

You assert: &quot;VW busses overheat.&quot; and &quot;...I'm driving a car that tends to 
overheat...&quot; I'd disagree entirely. Overheating and failure in air-cooled 
cars ONLY occurs at the hands of owners/drivers who maltreat their vehicle. 
It is not a complicated relationship. Bad driving causes VW failure, 
nothing else. Keep a stock VW motor properly tuned, keep it spinning over 
and don't overwork it, and it won't fail you.

My family has owned more than 20 air-cooled VWs since 1958 (our family car 
was a Karmann Ghia convertible; our 1st bus was in 1961, seven busses 
total). I can only guess that (collectively) we've driven those cars &gt;3 
million miles. Not once in those miles have any of our VWs &quot;overheated&quot; or 
sucked a valve. None of these cars had a head temperature gauge (two 914s 
had oil temp gauges).

If having a gauge makes you happy, no big deal. If you drive easy, you 
won't need it.
