Subject: Re: [T2] Listie Locations,

&gt;A list has already been created for the type2_dot_com list.  It's called AIRS
&gt;list : Air-cooled Interstate Rescue Squad.  The list includes names,
&gt;location and phone numbers of all interested VW owners from around the
&gt;world.

I guess you could use the AIRS List for such, but the intention for the AIRS 
List is to provide a local resource for helping get someones broken bus back 
on the road.  To change it into anything else would destroy its intended 
purpose.   The list is a group of good hearted volunteers who put thier 
information out there for the benefit of others.......Having them grouped by 
geographical area is necessitated by how they could be of help.

Mike
