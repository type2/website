Subject: Re: [T2] isolators and regulator info - Thanks Guys!

I hear what your saying and no fear I wasn't going to use 14 gauge
wire. I am going to use 10 gauge.  I like the idea of a switch to
be able to boost yourself.  But you can do that easy enough, just
run a different line of 4 or 5 gauge wire to a switch separate of
the relay.  Wouldn't take any extra time.

J

&gt;I used 4-gauge cable to wire my relay.  Same size as the heavy starter 
&gt;cables.  The nice thing is that you can have a simple switch to energize 
&gt;the relay manually in case you ever need to jump-start your starting 
&gt;battery from the aux battery.  Can't do this with an isolator, and can't do 
&gt;it if you use 14-gauge wire for your relay (aaaaaaahhh!  Please don't use 
&gt;14 gauge wire!).
