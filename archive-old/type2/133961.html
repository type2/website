Subject: water pump electric -&gt; manual

Has anyone retrofitted a manual water pump onto a later Westy that has an
electric switched faucet? 

I looked at a few pictures, and the manual pump appears to have a circular
body, and IIRC, is larger, and the switched faucet on my 74 is a small,
rectangular body. I imagine some slicing and dicing would need to be
performed. 

It all works fine AFAIK (still re-installing the sink from the PO), I just
prefer the sound and feel (and reliability) of a manual pump. 

On an electrical note, I appear to be missing the inline fuse holder from
my electric water pump. I assume the fuse is placed to protect the pump -
what amp fuse do I need here? 

Thanks, 
Dan
