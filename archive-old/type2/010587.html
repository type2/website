Just a final reminder:

A few VW bus and van folks are getting together at the Pennsburg Diner on Rt. 
663 (about 5 miles from the Quakertown I-476 exit) this Saturday starting 
around 9:30AM.  We'll just shoot the breeze, put some faces with e-mail 
addresses, talk VW, etc.  

Eventually, I hope we can get a local contingent to get together occasionally 
for technical sessions, maybe make the breakfasts a semi-regular thing, cruise 
nights, whatever people are into.  

I'll bring the final leftover BBTT shirts; I have 4 XL and 4 L shirts left _at_ 
$10 each.  If I'm stuck with them, they'll be prizes at BBTT 2000.  :-)

I have about 8 people or so who said they either will or might be there, 
including Ron Salmon from the Bus Depot.  

Drop me a line if you think you might come so I can get the appropriate size 
table.
