Hello All,

Trying to make sense of this array of hoses, wires (some cut),
and pipes related to smog equipment.  Any info would be greatly
appreciated!

1.Smog Pump-there is a metal canister in the same bracket next
to the smog pump, linked to the smog pump by a large hose.  A
smaller hose (vacuum line size) goes to a T and finally to the
charcoal canister in the engine compartment.  What is this critter,
and what does it do?

2.Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR Valve) Pretty sure that is what it
is, it has two pipe connectors in back (about half-inch od), it also
has a vacuum line going to the carb, and it has a two pin electrical
connector on the face.  I can't find the connector wire in the engine
compartment to go to the EGR - checked bently, haynes wiring diagram
doesnt show it.

3.  Appreciate your patience!  Finally on the drivers side of the
engine compartment a harness with two black wires extends from the
fire wall (cut), this is the only wires on this side of the engine  
compartment, any 74's out there able to identify these wires?

PS.  The good news is I have break lights, tail lights and turn signals.

PPS If anyone has a pair of dual solexes for a 74 (34 PDSIT 2/3) (No I am  
not on drugs just a dreamer!) I would give a fair price.

Thanks much!!!
