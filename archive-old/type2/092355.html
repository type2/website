Subject: Re: Help with distributor installation, seal question

Maybe I am mistaken after all and this is not a problem. It seems that I had
the Bentley's open to the California page. No extra O-ring seal exists on the
Federal model.

I guess this is ignorance and a non problem. Sorry for the bother and thanks
for all the replies. Now I can put this back in and get on the road.

Regards,

&gt; the o-ring is more of a flat o-rng than the traditional round one. It
&gt; goes on the distributor shaft, about 1&quot; or so down from the top (so a
&gt; ways up the shaft!). It goes in a groove. Be sure to put a tad of oil on
&gt; the ring when you slide it on the shaft and then the shaft into the
&gt; block.  The groove is about 3/16&quot; wide and not to deep.
