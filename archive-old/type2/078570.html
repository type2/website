Subject: On the subject of paint

I've got my '70 here and it has plenty of rust to work out, some patches I
have to put in and such.  It's also sporting some nice pitted rust spots
here and there on the roof, door edges... probably the usual severe places
(Surprisingly not much at all on the underside).  I daily drive this bus, so
it can't be down for too long with any one repair.  But that is exactly what
I want to do...   repair.  So, here's my question.  I want to rid of the
rust, and prep the metal in a preferable manner.  I'm also seeing a lot of
wincing at rattle can primers.  I'm totally open to suggestion I just don't
want to be pissed when I pay someone to lay the paint on it and, well you
know.  I also don't see being able to media blast the whole thing down to
the sparkling skin and just prime right over it with the patching and work
that I need to do.  Aside of taking it off of the road, how do the
experienced group members recommend I proceed?  I'm armed with my 4&quot;
grinder, my electric sander, but not a lot more.  I can get what I need to,
but have no garage to work in.  So I've tied one of my hands and both of my
feet behind my back and want to refinish my bus in the driveway.  :-)

Thanks in advance!
