&gt; My lights don't flick from high to low beam and I want to fix them.  I have
&gt; been trying to interpret the Bentley wiring diagrams and my wiring Bundle
&gt; under the Steering Wheel, and I located a brown wire that is dis-connected
&gt; and just hanging.  I believe this to be the culprit.

brown wires are usually ground wires

Bob

&gt; 
&gt; How do I know where to plug the wire from reading the Bentley book?  To
&gt; which fuse and which place?   It is on track 22 for the 1973 Bus wiring
&gt; diagram, but I can't figure out where to connect it from the book.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone please advise how to read this out of the Bentley manual.  It
&gt; should stop snowing here and be warm this weekend so I hope to get to work
&gt; on the bus Sat &amp; Sun!
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,
