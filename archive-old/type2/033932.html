Subject: Re: Dawn &amp; PLFVW &amp; &quot;Doing Business&quot;

Whenever I've been around or in crisis the response from others has always
been &quot;don't worry about it, get your life in order&quot;.

It sounds to me that Dawn's reputation lies in the quality of product she
provides to VW owners and so far all I've read is that he product in excellent
as are her past order filling abilities.

I'm going to suggest to everybody that's so inclined to email or better yet
send a Christmas card to Dawn and tell her &quot;Don't worry about it, get your
life in order.'

I'm going to.
