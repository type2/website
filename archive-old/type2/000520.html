Hi all, renoir here.

Too many projects.
I have a 1970 van that is in remarkably good shape. It does need a short
block, there
is a hole in the engine case ( i did not put it there). There is no rust
other than just a
smidgen under the winshield. It has an ice box, storage box, pop sunroof,
and foldout
rear bed seat. Tires are good including spare front mounted one. Glass is
good and clear, original carpet good, upholstry very good. All engine tin,
hose, etc. is there.
California registration good till end of April.

I am located in San Diego, but will be out of town this weekend. I will
repost later.
I have not listed this van anywhere else yet.
