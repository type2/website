&gt; I've been searching the archives for a wiring schematic for the supplementary

&gt; pre-1974 units. I even checked with Eberspacher USA, and they know nothing. I 
&gt; got my meater to work last night, I replaced the fuel lines first, thats all 
&gt; I replaced, What it looks like is the fuel metering pump is Not getting a 
&gt; pulsing signal that it's supposed to.  I gave the pump a seperate power 
&gt; supply and fed a pulsing power to it manually and the heater worked great. 
&gt; Only now I'd like to try and find out how to make it work on it's own ie; is 
&gt; there a controller or some sort of switch, or even an inline fuse that I 
&gt; couldn't find. I'm going back to work on it tonight, Fire extinguisher by my 
&gt; side, naturally.


the trigger is a set of points under the cap of the heater blower motor
(the one on the heater itself for combustion)  check to see if it closes
every so many revolutions, off the top of my head I think it is 7 but that
can't really go out of adjustment anyway.
