In the US, Westfalia pop tops hinged in the front from 68 to 73 with the
luggage section in the rear.
74 to 79 hinged in the rear with the luggage section in the front.
You never know if someone put a late top on an early bus or vice versa.


&gt; What year did the pop-top campers start poping from the front?  I found
one that looks like a late model body.. (mine is a 78 and the body looks the
same) but, where mine pops from the front, this one pops from the back....
luggage rack in the back.
