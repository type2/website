Subject: EuroCampers at HCBF

I will be leaving St. Louis Thursday evening heading for HCBF.  
I'm not going to be bringing much stuff, but if anyone was interested in a 
tent or Fiamma '68-'79 bus bike rack I should have room since I'm going to be 
by myself.  

The '74 Westy will be staying at home so I can get a chance to campout in my 
EuroVan Weekender.

Hope to see you there.
