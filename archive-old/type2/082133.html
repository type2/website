I think it would be an interesting test to compare engine drop and install
times for splitting the engine and transmission and dropping them both
together.

With the 911 - unless you have a fancy jack mount, I wouldn't try
separating them because aligning the engine with the trans when the engine
weighs as much as that puppy does, is a royal pain. You also end up with an
elaborate sequence of raising the car and then the engine and then lowering
the car and raising the engine more. It's not difficult, it just takes a
few steps. Because of the ground clearance of the bus, you don't have to
lift it as high ( see
http://scrounge.bradway_dot_net/pictures/porsche/clutch/pb2_11.jpg ).

The bus engine is MUCH easier to deal with because of the lower weight and
higher clearance.

&gt; installed their type4 engine with the tranny in place and fan housing
&gt; attached.  I've NEVER been able to do that.  Back before I started

We did have the carb and manifold installed - but not the air filter. We
also had the oil fill tube removed - and the back-side tin.

&gt; Tyler, I really doubt that the transaxle's input shaft is coming out -
&gt; you just need more clearance, clarence.  :)

It's all about clearance - and if you let the transmission 'sag', you can
get the entire engine below the bumper (or the bumper over the engine) and
slide out even if the input shaft is five feet long ;) With the Porsche we
had to keep alternating between raising the car and lowering the engine. I
won't do that again with just one floor jack - it would have gone twice as
fast with two jacks - but as I said - the bus doesn't have the same problem.
