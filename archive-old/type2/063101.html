Subject: Gas Heater Info?

Hey all, I am on the search for a complete, working gas heater for my 
'71 bus.  I have it in the back of my mind that the BN-4 is one of the
best to get.  I am sure I gleaned that info from a collection of posts
over the last 2.5 years.  I would like to know more about heaters 
before I buy one.  Ideally I would know something about the different 
models, what years they were offered, etc.

I have a question or two about their operation as well.  My bus has no
heater boxes.  I have come to enjoy working around an engine that 
doesn't.  Can a heater 'replace' the need for the heater boxes or is 
it too much for basic defrosting in those cool but not cold 
circumstances?  Mostly, my bus gets driven to the store once a week 
and then big trips on the weekends.  Heat is not really an issue for 
the short trip.  If possible I would like to do without heater boxes 
and just wire the gas heater into the existing heat duct.  I really 
only have the money for one or the other right now and I don't think 
heater boxes alone will keep me from freezing on long drives this 
winter.  I commute about 700 miles round trip twice a month.  Ouch, I 
don't like reading that even.

So, if you could offer suggestions or point me to web resources I 
would appreciate it.  I know there are tent, tire, rust, tool FAQS.
If one exists for heaters I have missed it.  Thanks, Jim
