Subject: Timing My 71 Campmobile

Hello Everyone...Getting ready to time my 71 and I am a little unclear 
whether I time to 5 deg (After Top Dead Center)....I was watching the Bug Me 
Video..and he says time the engine 7.5 deg (Before Top Dead Center)...If 
someone could clear this up for me..that would be great..Thanks alot..Adam
