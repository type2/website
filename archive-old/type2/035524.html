&gt;
&gt; What I have checked: (note all checks were static or while cranking)
&gt; Dwell = 50 
&gt; Timing ~8 BTDC
&gt; spark visually verified
&gt; Gas pressure = 30+psi at the tap between 3&amp;4


Was the gas pressure checked while cranking or while static?
If the gas pressure fluctuates heavily it would indicate
either a bad pressure regulator or an injector sticking open.

Have you put an ohmmeter on the two temp sensors to see 
if they are still in range? Test from the FI harness plug to make sure
that nothing is broken along the way.

OK, here is the worst suggestion:
Have you pulled a valve cover and verified
that the valves are actuating? If you can pull the starter
from the rear you can test the same thing with your palm
over the tailpipe while cranking.

Pull the electrical harness off of the fuel pump and try starting.
If it is flooded with gas it should at least try once or
twice as the gas pressure drops.

Dump question department:
You didnt fill up with something besides gas, did you?
The FI computer is getting power? It is grounded?

Dont forget the most important thing: Physical comfort will
go a long way toward a good job. You cant pay attention to the
job at hand if you are thinking of the snow creeping down the back
of your neck. So, get cardboard, carpet remnants, whatever and make
yourself a comfortable work area.

If you are still having a lot of problems tomorrow and the ice storm
is not comming, let me know and I might be able to stop by and
lend you a hand. Two wrinkled foreheads are better than one.
