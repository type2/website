Subject: Re: [T2] Starter Dummy!

Heh... I just took mine off to get the engine out ... otherwise I wouldn't 
know how to do it either.  I took out the oil bath air filter as part of the 
engine removal, so that made the bold behind the flywheel easier to see.  
The offending nut is almost behind the air filter, but a little on the side 
towards the right hand carb; it's a 17mm.  Feel free to pmail me if you want 
help taking the air filter out.

I hope that helped a little bit.  Good luck.

&gt;I am completely embarrassed to admit it, but I can't get the starter off my
&gt;72. I was told that there is a long bolt that goes thru to the engine
&gt;compartment, but where? I have looked everywhere for it with no luck? Can
&gt;someone please point me in the right direction? Thank you in advance.
