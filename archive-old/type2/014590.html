I am not going to Flame Ron, or his business, because he most certainly
has been fair with me.
The only thing that aggravates me is when you place your order, they
should tell you that they are running behind, because they are
temporarily under-staffed, and the order is going to take more than the
customary 7--to --10 days.
But the little girl on the phone keeps the same script, no announcemets.

Then I just happened to place another order in the interim an after I
got done placing the order, I inquired about the prior one.
&quot;Sorry I can't answer that question on this line&quot;

What the hell----I'm here, now, and I'm the one being inconvenienced,
just answer my question--- where's my stuff?


NOPE--I had to call again, just to find out Ronald's having labor
problems.

Very inconsiderate, but life goes on in the big city.

I keep taking mental notes--------
