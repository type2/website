Hi All

1971 Westy...

With the recent thread on tires I decided to take a good look at mine and
I'll probably replace them before the end of summer.

My stock wheels are pretty rusty. I thought about getting these sandblasted
then painted, but wonder if it would be quicker/cheaper just to go to a junk
yard and try to find some in better shape and have tires mounted to them.

What is a good price for wheels at a junk yard? Are there any better looking
ones from other vehicle makes that fit? Anything to be on the lookout for? I
see in various catalogs I can get new ones for about $25-30 each.

Thanks

Pete
