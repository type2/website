Subject: Re: [T2] Gas fill elbows COOL FIND

I'm embarrased to admit it but around 4 years ago I replaced my lower elbow
with a VW part that cost me $75. My mechanic called his knowledgeable VW
parts guy and he said the unofficial substitute was a Vanagon part, which I
had him order. What came was a long 12 to 14&quot; long piece of hose with a
bend in it at one end. Sure enough, it was the correct diameter and the
bend was very close to the correct radius. I still have the rest of the
hose I cut off as a memento, as well as a non leaking filler neck. At that
time the upper elbow was NLA so I coated the existing one with black RTV
whihc sort of lasted until I heard about the australian elbows and ordered
some of those.

Of course not long after I found the type2 list and started hearing about
the Gates substitutes for far less money for the lower elbow and felt a bit
stupid. My 78 passenger bus is slated for a new clutch, gas tank cleaning
and coating, vent lines and new filler neck elbows this spring. I still
have an australian upper elbow in my parts stock, but I will need a lower
elbow substitute.
