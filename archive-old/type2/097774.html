&lt;&lt; Mark my words: VW will start &quot;supporting&quot; the vintage market in 10 years,

after most of the aftermarket is gone, and they finally &quot;re-discover&quot; their

heritage. This will be after they realize the damage they've done to

themselves, and it's too late.

makers left standing in ten years and will have even less connection
to the original air-cooleds.
