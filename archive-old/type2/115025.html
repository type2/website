Subject: Re: [T2] rod orientation

on 5/7/03 19:03, you related:


&gt; Common sense tells me that all the numbers should be on the same side in
&gt; operating orientation.  Is there a top and a bottom?  Please help if you
&gt; can.

greg,

type IV rods do not have an orientation dimensionally the way type 1 rods
do. what i mean is that TIV rods are symmetrical. T1 rods have an offset at
the small end, so the numbers must all face the same way in operation.

however, there is still a correct orientation, which is numbers up in
operation. this makes all the tangs in the rod bearings also face the same
way, which is away from the direction of rotation.
