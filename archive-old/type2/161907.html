Well, I got the Danish version, and it had the dimples in the muffler, but
they weren't &quot;dimpled&quot; enough. Still too close by about 3/4&quot;. There is a
thread on Samba about this and guys who have done it have had to use their
hammers or their creativity. Not a big deal either way, if it lasts as long
as people are saying.

&gt; That depends on the muffler. In Europe two versions of the muffler were
&gt; offered, one that had a few carefully placed &quot;dimples&quot; that allowed it to
&gt; clear the heater tubes, and one that didn't and therefore only fit a Bus. In
&gt; the U.S., you can get the Dansk version with the dimples but not the Ernst
&gt; version.
