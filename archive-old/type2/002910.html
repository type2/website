Subject: POR15 Fuel Tank Kit Needed ASAP

Wise List,

I need to get a complete POR15 auto fuel tank repair kit for Casper as soon
as possible. (Thought I had one in my store shed)

Anyone have a RELIABLE source that will give me high probability of my
getting it shipped off today so I will have it tomorrow ??

Can you please post the above for me?
