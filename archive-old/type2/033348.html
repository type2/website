&gt; &gt; Station wagon = Kombi = VIN of 23something.
&gt; 
&gt; Not quite.  A station wagon has a full passenger interior and a VIN of
&gt; 22x-xxx...  In the US, most of them came with deluxe exterior trim as
&gt; well.
&gt; 
&gt; A Kombi has a more Spartan interior and a VIN of 23x-xxx...  Kombis
&gt; were also the basis of the campmobile.
