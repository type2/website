Subject: Hydraulic lifters

Well the fun never stops.  Just got my CV's fixed &amp; now something else.  My
hydraulic lifters were making noise in the morning.  They would quiet down
in about 10-15 second.  Then I started to get a ticking like a loose valve.
I went to adjust them &amp; some of them have no clearance between the rocker &amp;
the valve end.  What I mean I that the rocker is bearing down on the valve.
I actually removed the adjusting screw but the valve still has no clearance.
Where do I go from here?  Is it off to buy new lifters?  Help!!
