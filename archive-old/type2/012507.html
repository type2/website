ok, as of saturday evening there is now a
'73 standard in my driveway.  some of you may
remember me posting a few questions after test
driving it a couple of weeks ago. anyway, just
wanted to let everyone know of the 'rescue' &amp; that
i will probably be posting many questions to the
all-knowing list in the near future. &amp; now for my
first question...

hazards work front &amp; rear, but turn signals work
only in the rear. havent done much poking around
under the dash yet, but all fuses &amp; connections 
look ok upon initial inspeciton. any ideas of
where to start? please respond by pmail, i'm in
digest mode.

also, i on friday i posted a question asking the approx.
value of the original Westy ice cube trays. thanks to all
who responded, &amp; the results of the poll indicated the
value of these items to be between $20-$35.

TIA
