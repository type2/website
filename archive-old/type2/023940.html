Hi Courtney---
     Don't know where you live, but here in SoCal most of the pumps have that 
huge vapor-recovery foreskin thing, and some of them are almost impossible to 
use.  My problem is gas leaking down the side of the bus.  They seem to work 
a little better if you pull back the foreskin as far as you can and point the 
nozzle almost straight down into the tank (don't force it cause you can break 
the filler neck---a pain to replace).  For some reason the Mobil stations in 
my area use a plain nozzle that works great, so I just get my gas there.  

Good luck, Matt Q. '77 Westfalia
