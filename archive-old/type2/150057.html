&gt; hello marcus  the 914 heads are like that, but they only have 3 intake studs
&gt; holding the intake manifolds.  As for carbs I would use either dells or
&gt; webers.  Call me at my shop as I might have an extra set of dells  later  mark

Most engines that used d-jet injection had breather nipples on the heads.

411/412, some 914 2.0 (there are some 914 2.0 with no breather, not sure why
but I built an engine with them last year and I had to machine the heads for
the breather nipples) and early 914 1.7. I don't think d-jet was ever on a
914 1.8.
