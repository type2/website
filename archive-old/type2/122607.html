Free 1984 VW van for parts -- have title. Not a camper, not a 4x4. Just a
GL. Missing lots of parts including engine and transmission, part of the
cooling system, dash, CV axles, wiring, carpet. It is towable on two wheels.
Brakes work and it does roll properly. Body and glass pretty much OK.
Contact me for pix.
