For those not on the PA Vanagon mailing, a few of us in eastern PA (and some 
from adjoining states) are getting together for an informal breakfast to talk 
VW and maybe set up some future technical sessions.  We'll be at the Pennsburg 
Diner on Rt. 663 (right off the Quakertown exit of the PA Turnpike NE Extension 
[I-476]), Saturday, Nov 13 at 9:30AM - ?  &quot;We&quot; could be as few as 2...I have no 
idea who's interested in coming.

If you're interested in joining the mailing list, which is mostly for local 
events, etc. go to 

http://www.onelist_dot_com/subscribe/pavanagon 

and sign up.  It's a very low volume list.  

The idea of technical sessions comes from Larry and Avery Johnsons in Canada 
who had a similar Saab owners' club.  I hope to particularly get non-technical 
people the confidence to do some wrenching themselves, or at least know what's 
going on so they can't be snookered by dishonest mechanics.  

I figure we could meet at someone's house for these sessions (and/or maybe the 
Bus Depot if Ron lets us) and see/help some work being done.  Ideas include a 
tour of the engine compartment, gas line replacement, cap &amp; rotor, ignition 
wires, the Digitool, etc.  I'll also be getting a used 2.1L engine on which I 
want to do the headgaskets while it's out of the vehicle.  

E-mail me if you think you might come.
