Subject: Re: [T2]76-79 two piece collapsible cot

Bus Depot wrote:
&gt; These have the '70-75 style one-piece poles, though, which do not
&gt; retract for storage under a '76-79 Westy sofabed. So while the cot will
&gt; fit thru '79, if you have a '76-79 Westy you'd either have to find a
&gt; different place to store it when not in use, or modify the poles to fold
&gt; or separate for storage. ...  Also, the brackets that screw
&gt; onto the door pillars are not included (although if your bus is a Westy
&gt; you already have them.)


Also If you have the one piece poles and have a later Westy (Which I know
you do not Cha) the brackets will have to be remounted.  The collapsible
poles are easily swapped between the different mounts but not the solid
ones.
