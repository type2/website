=======================&gt;
That was me, and I think I found what I want, but I have not been able 
to stay home long enough to pursue actually buying and installing same.

It looks as though there are several makes of dual function LED gauges 
out there that will fit the bill for a bus owner.

Next week, I am off again for just a few days to pick up another '70 
bus and a '63 Notch.
Gonna get rid of the Buick Park Avenue Ultra and replace it with a Notch.
'bout time I came to my senses and made me and normalcy more separated.

After I get back home and can begin to settle bask in like a regular 
USA domestic sort for a bit, I am gonna see about actually getting 
after the work of putting in a dual function gauge in Casper for one of 
my Spring projects.

I'll let the list know how I make out.

Bob in Houston

BTW
The other bus will be Wendy Good Bench.
The Notch will be Otto Auto.
