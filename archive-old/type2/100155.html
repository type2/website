Subject: Re: [T2] Wing window latch removal

Hi Mike,

I went through this on my bus this summer. It's a PITA job.

There is no simple way to replace the mechanism, you have to replace 
the entire wing window. First you pull the door panel, the window, then 
the vent wing can be removed.

Or you could drill out the fastener on the latch, and replace it with a 
new rivet, assuming you could find something appropriate.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; Is there any special trick or tool needed to remove the latch on the 
&gt; wing
&gt; window? I need to take the one off of my &quot;old&quot; bus, as the  driver's 
&gt; side wing
&gt; window latch on my &quot;new &quot; bus is missing the black knob that you grip. 
&gt; Bentley
&gt; offers no enlightement on this particular subject.
&gt; Could I just take the knob off, or is that more of a PITA?
&gt; TIA
