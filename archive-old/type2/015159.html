What is the original color of the under color. 
For those of us who want to do a ground up resto knowing only the exterior
color and interior color does not help when it comes to the under carriage.
Are they all the same or do they vary according to exterior colors. 
My bus would is mouse grey.
Any help would be appreciated!
