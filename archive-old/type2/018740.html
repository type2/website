ok...second time typing this...I hate my computer...

ok...my ignition switch is fried, but when I turn the key to start it,
it cranks the starter but gives no spark...and when I turn the key to
the &quot;on&quot; position, it permits the engine to run...
so, in order to give spark to the coil I'm putting in a lighted toggle
switch.  A wire from the battery to the switch, a wire from the switch
to the coil, and of course a wire from the switch to a ground.
I flip the switch to give juice to the coil, turn the key to start the
engine, turn the key to the &quot;run&quot; or &quot;on&quot; position, and flip the toggle
switch off to keep the engine running.
anyone ever do this before.  I'm just fixing my problem with getting
juice to the coil in the &quot;start&quot; position of the key....
like I said....after I flip the toggle switch off, the engine keeps
running when the key is in the &quot;on&quot; position....
anyone ever had problems with this before?
what amp fuse should I use for an in-line fuse from the battery to the
toggle switch?
and of course the switch has an idiot light to let me (the idiot) know
when it is on....I don't want to give constant juice to the coil from
the battery...that would be bad...
I didn't install it yet, but I plan to shortly
you get the jist of it right?
