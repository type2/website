&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;   I just recently had the engine rebuilt (1800 carburated) in my westy a few
&gt; weeks back. I have just finished putting the engine in and I have come
&gt; across a problem. When ever I try to put it in reverse the engine cuts out.
&gt; It does not jerk forward when it cuts out either, the engine just cuts out.

You have a short in the back-up light circuit.  The back up lights take
power from the coil, through an in-line fuse holder, through the switch on
the front of the transmission, throught he bulbs and on to ground.  If the
fuse isn't blown, the problem is probably in the wire between the coil and
the in-line fuse holder.  You can disconnect the wire from the coil for a
temporary fix, but the permanent fix should be easy.
