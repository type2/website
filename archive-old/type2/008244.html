Subject: 2.0 in a '72 (New thread not same as Jan)
Date: Sat, 06 Feb 1999 14:32:31 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have a '72 with the orignal pancake engine in.  My cyl. heads need to 
be replace but I was thinking of putting in a Rebuilt 2.0.

Questions:
1) Is this a good idea in the long run or will I save more money by just 
re-doing the heads?

2) Does anyone know where I can get (or does anyone have) a rebuilt 2.0 
for cheap in the So. Cali. area.  I only have about $1,000 to do this!!  

**I need to get my van up and running as it is my daily driver.**

Thank you for the help in advance.
