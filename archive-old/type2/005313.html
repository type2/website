Subject: [VB] Cape to Cairo update


Hey Volks

This is the first time I've sat down to write since I announced my Cape to
Cairo by Kombi trip. Well, I said we were planning on leaving on July 2,
which is today ... err ... and we're nowhere near ready yet! We've put the
departure date back to July 15 to give us time to finish preparing the car,
and to allow some potential sponsors to come up with a package.

I've been dreaming of driving a vintage VW bus across Africa for 10 years,
and in that time I have designed in my head the ultimate bus for
off-paved-road adventuring. But then a year ago I met Espen Svensen, a young
Norwegian who drove a bone stock 1959 Kombi from Cape Agulhas (southernmost
point in Africa) to North Cape (northernmost point in Europe). He planned to
do that long haul in six weeks and, when I met him, I told him he'd never
manage it so fast, especially driving on 2-ply passenger car tyres. He just
laughed and went anyway. Well, Espen completed Agulhas to North Cape in
three months, with 6 weeks off the road for a breakdown in Ethiopia. So I
guess he did his journey in six weeks as planned.

So when my dot_dot_com employer closed down suddenly at the end of March I
realised it is time to do this trip. And since I had neither the time nor
money to build my ultimate AfrikaBus, I figured I'd use what I have. Of all
the buses in my collection, only my 63 Dormobile and my 75 splitty Zebra Bus
are strong enough for this trip. And since I can't imagine ever selling the
Dormer, the Zebra Bus was chosen as our trans-continental conveyance. The
Zebra Bus is a 1975 &quot;Fleetline&quot; Kombi. These were Brazilian CKD buses
assembled by VWSA in 1975, one year only, and probably the last splitty
production anywhere. See pics of the Zebra Bus on Thom's site:

So far, the only modification I have made to this bus is to fit a brand new
full-length roofrack, which I discovered is still being made by the local
company that supplied VWSA's aftermarket racks in the air-cooled days. I
have had a 1600DP engine built for the journey, as well as a rebuilt
transmission, which I am busy installing today, and which should both be in
the car by the end of Wednesday. I am also getting six 6-ply commercial
tyres for the trip.

Next step will be to add a bed, some panelling and a middle seat in the
back; then we just need the tyres and that's all I plan on doing to the bus
before we leave.

I had hoped to be able to publish pics online, but I lost access to a
digital camera when the company closed. I was going to buy one for the trip,
but I find I have run too low on funds ... oh well, I'll make some kind of
plan before we leave ... Also, the friend who agreed to design our website
didn't really have the time for it, with the result that we don't yet have a
site ... arrrgh. Anyway, she finally sent me a working draft last night, so
maybe the site will be up this week. I'll keep the list posted.

I have done all my spare-parts shopping for the journey; I'll post my parts
list separately, since the list was just discussing road trips and parts.

Well, there it is, not too much to tell, but my Zebra Safari across Afrika
is still on! Things are accelerating fast now, so updates will be more
regular from now, especially when the website is finally up and running.

My partner and fellow traveller has organised a few sponsorships for the
trip. The sponsors have been really slow to make up their minds, but so far
we have promised:
2x Sony DVCams (PD100 and PD150 -- we're making movies!)
6x 6ply Goodyear commercial tyres
GPS and map/nav software
Film for my cameras (the old-fashioned kind, not digital)

We are also waiting for final word on whether we have a sponsor for the
remaining camping kit and hardware we need, and we are in final discussions
with a company that wants to offer us satellite communications! This would
be great, but it looks like it will delay us longer than I'm prepared to
wait. We shall see ...

I'll keep the list posted ...
