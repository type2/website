Check the available voltage at terminal 50 on the solenoid, (that's the
little push-on terminal), with the key turned to start and the terminal
still installed.  If you have less than about 10.5 volts the problem is in
the voltage supply to terminal 50.  You said you have a booster relay
already installed but I've seen them fail or maybe the relay, or the wiring
to it, isn't big enough to supply enough current.
