&gt;Anyway, the seats are pretty nice (although an armrest is
&gt;missing and another one is wiggly) but they're real dirty/
&gt;greasy.  How can I clean these things?

Hi!

Try &quot;Resolv&quot;

It's a carpet cleaning product that you can buy at the grocery 
store.... it's incredible!

Good luck!
