&gt; &gt; Maybe, but how much sense does this make? If I

&gt; If you are building a rail framed vehicle, you
&gt; usually are required to apply for a newly
&gt; manufactured vehicle title, which will not have a
&gt; VIN.

some years ago when I built a kit car, when finished I had to take it to a
shop with a lift and a State Trooper from the auto inspection unit spent
two days going over the thing with a fine tooth comb. when I fixed the
problems identified, I was issued a metal plate about 2X4 inches with an
engraved number on it and told I had to permanently affix it to the frame.

then I was issued a title and inspection certificate so I could register
the car.   was a quite complex prochedure
