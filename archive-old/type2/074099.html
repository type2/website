Subject: 76 engine dismantle

while breaking down a 76 engine for complete rebuild, I have a lot of oil pouring out of the driver side heater box from the flange to the exhaust elbow.

this engine sat for 10 years. could oil have gotten there without something catastrophic happening? I don't have the heads off yet.

will consult archives, but any tips for a total newbie case cracking?

thanks

bill
