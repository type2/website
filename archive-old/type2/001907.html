It has been a while since I did any audio work and technology changes so
fast but this could work. Some genius like Andy(whose last name starts with
the initial Pechenik) is knowledgeable in this area. What would also be
useful is for people to be able to FTP their .wav files or whatever to a
central site so others could listen and help diagnose the sounds.

For example: Hey I got these symptom and this funny sound. Here is a
description of the symptoms and checkout the sound at
www.mybussoundsfunny_dot_com
