&gt; Anyway, I got a great deal on the bus because the PO hit a deer
&gt; with it.  It crushed the center front of the bus in a good 6
&gt; inches.  It missed the bumper and the lip under the window but
&gt; everything else is crunched.  What I'm wondering is has anyone
&gt; gotten damage like this fixed before?  Is it worth fixing or
&gt; should I buy new metal from RMMW or somebody?


I have brand new bus noses (everything below the windshield) for $139 plus
shipping. They do take about 10 days to get.  These are the '73-79 style
(turn signals above the headlights) and also can be used on '68-73 with the
appropriate modifications.  Shipping can be somewhat on the high side
($25-60 depending on destination) because of size, but even so, the total
delivered cost is relatively low.
