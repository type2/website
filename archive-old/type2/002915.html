Today is my birthday.  Anyone want to sell me the 76-79 westy campstool I
have sought for so long?  Sage green plaid would be great, but I can't be
choosy here.  If not for me, do it for my wonderful wife on mothers
day...we're expecting #5 in Oktober!
Thanks!
Jay
77 westy deluxe-yeah we can camp in it. we just can't all ride in it
together.
