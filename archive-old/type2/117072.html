&gt;Go to your FLAPS or Walmart and get a 6&quot; flexible extension hose for a
&gt;grease gun.  You'll also need a brass coupling from the hardware store to
&gt;mount to the sender.  I mounted mine on the fan shroud behind the dizzy.

Something about the threads being wrong. Use at your own risk.

Also - check that hose regularly. Noticed my 5 year old, stored in the dark

grease gun has a hose that is cracked all over badly and will be replaced
soon.

Hate to have you (or anyone) use that hose and have it rot and burst
causing a mess and a fried engine. Remember - check every five years!
