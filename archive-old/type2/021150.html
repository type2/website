Subject: Free A/C

Hello,
I've an overhead A/C unit sitting in my garage collecting dust right 
now.  I also have a compressor for a type4 engine (the engine had a 
fire, so I dunno if the compressor works) and I believe the mounting 
stuff for it.  The hoses on the overhead unit were cut, but those are 
pretty easy to fab up.  I think thats all I have for the system, but I 
may have some more odds and ends.  It was pulled from a 73 bus.
Come and pick it up and its yours.  Or I can deliver it within a 
reasonable area if you persuade me.  I'm in Oshkosh, WI.  The unit is in 
nice shape.
Other parts to make a complete system can be used off of a vanagon I 
believe.  I'm not really sure though.  A/C isn't too difficult.  Routing 
the lines will be the hardest part I would think.
If you do make a system out of it and need it charged, bring your bus to 
me and I'll charge it for you even for pretty cheap.  I think I've still 
got 2-30 pound tanks of R12 left even, or R134a if you prefer.  I'm not 
sure on the specifics of converting a bus over though.

Isaiah
