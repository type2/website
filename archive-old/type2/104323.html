Subject: Re: [T2] Future of the type IV engine?

&gt; If we believe Berg (see his opinion on line boring, refurbished cases
&gt; and new cases at http://www.geneberg_dot_com/casepg22.htm), we are spending
&gt; good money on used cases that will not live up to our expectations on
&gt; longevity and performance.

Isnt this is a dissertation on magnesium alloy cases?\
Much of the longevity and wear
issues dont apply to the aluminum t4 cases.
The aluminum is stronger, does not fatigue and is much more easily
repaired.
