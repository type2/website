&gt;It does depend on your point of view.
&gt;
&gt; On the other side of the equation is cost to hire the work done.
&gt;If it takes you 4 hours to perform a correct procedure that would take a
&gt;skilled mechanic 1 hour to do and his rate is $70/hour, your hours were
&gt;worth $17.50. If you take home $20/hr in your vocation, hiring the work out
&gt;is ecomically feasable as a possible enhancement of the cost/mile ratio.

In Canada, $20/hr. would put you in the 40% tax bracket, so you would have
to work about six hours to keep the $70 to pay the mechanic.  I can't
imagine any repair that would take me 6 times as long as a mechanic would
take.  (Of course, I was a mechanic at one time.)
