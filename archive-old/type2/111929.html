Subject: Re: [T2] '78 &amp; '79 Deluxe Middle sliding windows

&gt; From what I've read, NO bus was ever sold (in North
&gt; America at least) that didn't have some type of
&gt; window opening in the middle section. 
&gt; There were no solid glass middle windows.

Not in North America perhaps. You Americans are so
spoiled with all the luxury you had on your T2's...

back-up lamps, padded dashboard, rear window
defroster, type 4 engine, ventilation windows,...

;-)

Back here in Europe we were choking in the back of our
1600cc 9 seater kombi's with no form of ventilation at
all!!!

My 1978 kombi was delivered like that:

- 9 seats (VW Type 231211)
- no ventilation windows in the back (only in cabin
doors (M507)
- and no fresh air ducting on the cabin doors to guide
air to the passenger compartmet

And all the windows in the back were solid pieces of
glass. Of course I am collecting M-codes for my car so
I upgraded it a little bit since I bought it in 1996.

yours,


Vincent (from The Netherlands)
