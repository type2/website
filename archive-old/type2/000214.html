My 1971 camper has a leak that for the life of me, I cannot find the source
of....during heavy rain, the spare wheel recess at the back left-hand side
 the ONLY spare wheel recess ) ends up collecting water.
It seems to be dripping down from above, but the window seals appear to be
fine.
Can it be coming through the air intake ? Is there any way of tracing the
water flow to its source ?
Can anyone help ?
