&gt;&gt;The automatic choke isn't going off all the way - even
when the engine is warm - it is still staying on one notch&lt;&lt;

On the right side of the carb is the choke.  It has a wire from the coil attached to it.  It is basically a ceramic(?) disc with the word &quot;solex&quot; on it held in place by a metal ring that is screwed in with 3 little screws.  On a WARM engine loosen these little screws just enough to be able to turn this little disc inside the ring. Hold the idle throttle arm back and Turn the choke disc back and forth a couple times to see how it affects the little cam-step-lever thingy that holds the throttle ildler arm screw thingy open when the choke is on.  Once you see how this works, turn it just to the point that the cam-step-lever thingy DOESN'T rest on it, remember do this on a WARM engine.  Tighten the screws and there you have it!  When the engine gets cold the choke will activate and the cam lever thing will come down and once the engine warms up the choke will disengage and rest in this new place where you have set it.  I apologize for all the &quot;technical&quot; terms (thingy, etc), but t!
his should at least convey my points!
