&gt; Hi John Here
&gt; I have an idea. Why don't you start a busathon? Start by getting some
&gt; sponsors to pay you per day or per week depending on the person. You can
also
&gt; have a buscam so people can check in on your expedition. I think its a
pretty
&gt; nutty idea
&gt; to try and live in your bus all winter and I would pay to see someone try
it.
&gt; I would start a website refrigerator expedition _dot_com, come see someone
freeze
&gt; there nuts off in outback. I think some people would rise to the cause to
&gt; keep you going with
&gt; supplies and donations. We could take bets on how long you would last
before
&gt; you turn into a frozen TV dinner.                          JPB2001
