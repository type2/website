Subject: Re: [T2] Installing front shocks

First check the BD website, the part# on the box, and your invoice to 
make certain you have the correct shock.

I ran into this putting Gabriels(from local FLAPS) on my 67. I had to 
press the bushing out of the OEM shocks and use it in the Gabe. Also, 
front and rear shocks are different and as I recall from my 67 the 
rear had a smaller hole in the bushing then the front. You may also 
find that there is a sleeve on the stud for the front lower shock 
mount. I recall H. Steve talking about getting the damx thing off. 
That may also solve your problem.

Good luck.

&gt;I'm replacing the OE front shocks on my camper with KYB gas-a-just's and I
&gt;noticed that the metal sleeve isn't the same size.
