mornin y'all

    I don't know who made the original but one of my friends made (in his
garage) a little gizmo that locks around the pedals and braces against the
floor, thus keeping any of the pedals from being depressed.
    also recently after having all my tools stolen from my bus, in my drive
way, I started looking at alarm systems, and found that although non of the
&quot;auto security experts&quot; here in north west Ohio have a clue ore have ever
seen a Bus, they would, after some pushing, sell me a system that I could
tie in to the dome light switches (the things that turn on the interior
lights when door is opened) and when the door was opened would trigger
_______ (fill in the blank I don't know what yet, I'm still working on it)
options include: a ghetto alarm, flashing lights, or electrical cut out
system.
I hope some of these ideas might help

&gt; Hiya Dan,
&gt;
&gt; Anything you do to make the old Bus a more uninviting target will help.
And
&gt; in that sense, the Club or devices like it do deter theft.  But if the guy
&gt; who picks your bus to steal is determined.....................well, the
Club
&gt; sure isn't gonna stop him.  All he has to do is cut the steering wheel
with a
&gt; set of bolt cutters and that thing slips right off.
&gt; Most of the folks I've talked to advocate the use of a visible deterrent
such
&gt; as the Club along with another hidden system.  Most often mentioned as a
&gt; hidden system is a hidden kill switch.  This switch will disable your
primary
&gt; ignition circuit while you are out of the car.  So, if the guy does pop
your
&gt; window and cut your wheel, he's not going anywhere.  Leaves you open to
&gt; stereo ripoff, but you still have the Bus.  Just be careful where you put
the
&gt; switch - these guys are wise to this trick.  But they will not spend a
great
&gt; deal of time trying to find that switch.
&gt;
