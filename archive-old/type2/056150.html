I really hope this works, for I am a computer idiot.  Guess I oughta introduce myself.  I'm Frank aka MrBubbleHead.  I am currently living in Eugene, Oregon.  At this time I own 13 VW's, who knows what tomorrow holds :)!!  Michael B, has been after for me for quite a while to come check you folks out....you have one together group going.  And if I did every thing right, I should be able to post and post regularly.  I am constanly have fun and daring VW adventures (burnt my eyebrows off once, drove a 59' bus cross country, and drive a 57 single cab everyday) so you can see I'm a little nuts.  But having been into VW's 25 + years you gotta be!!   I look forward to hearing of others adventures and hope to learn more of our beloved VW's.
Peace, Love,and if you don't believe I'm nuts, ask Michael....LOL
