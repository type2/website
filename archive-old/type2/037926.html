Subject: Re: In-line blower

Jason... I installed an inline blower in my '71 when i replaced the central 
tube under the cargo area floor... mine is a bilge blower, 3&quot; diameter, and 
fit nicely with the 3&quot; PVC I used to replace my rusted out tube.  They run 
about $25 bucks at a boat supply store, or thru West Marine... Mine happens 
to be an Atwood blower....
It sure kicks out the extra air, sucking it from the heat exchangers.... and 
a heck of a racket....sounds like a small jet engine reving for take off... i 
found a adjustable light switch from a junkyard toyota, and installed that 
instead of an on/off switch.... now i can adjust the speed of the blower, and 
at lower speeds the sound drops into the background noise...
I wouldn't spend more than $30 bucks for an in-line blower, not when the 
bilge blower works nicely.... but ya have to do the rest of the stuff too.... 
insulate the heat ducts, make sure the bus is sealed better and insulated...
