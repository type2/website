here tis:
remember, if there is no price, it means CALL; either it is way pricey or
WAY cheap. My buddy's name is Lewis Cowdrey, reach him at 512-447-6687; you
can email me with requests, I call him within 6 hours of reading my mail
most days, but DIRECT calls will most likely get the part! He'll give you
ten minutes of gab about anything for free, after that, he hears clocks
ticking! PRICES DO NOT INCLUDE FREIGHT!! We are finding new stuff all the
time, and will post updates. Note that most of this stuff is for bugs, but
the engine parts should be of great interest... plus, it seems half of us
have a bug &amp; bus set!
