Subject: Re: [T2] How much material?

I haven't *done* this yet, so take any advice with a grain of salt, but
I have pondered it, and it appears that much canvas comes in 150cm
bolts, which should be enough to cut the side panels out of.  Since
those side panels are more-or-less triangles, it should also be
possible to cut both of them out of roughly the same length of canvas.
I'm not yet sure whether the windows would be best sewed by cutting out
the window, and using a separate piece, bigger than the hole you cut,
to cover it afterwards, or whether one could get away with sewing the
zipper straight onto the panel, then cutting it open and using a few
long bias-cut strips of fabric to tidy up the edges and make a storm
flap to cover the zipper.  Not even sure if that explanation makes any
sense on screen.  It's clear in my mind :)

Anton.
