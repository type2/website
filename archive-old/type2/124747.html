Subject: Sunroof drain

Hi all,

The new to me bus has a sunroof.  Very cool.  It opens/closes like it
should.  But alas it has no seal (will be looking for one on-line
shortly - suggestions on suppliers gladly accepted).  In the rainiest
state I know of (WA), it is not good to not have a seal.  So while
waiting for the seal she has a temporary strip of duct tape.  I feel so
Donald Trump.  However, in learing of my need for the seal, I spy some
drains for the sunroof.  Problem is they don't drain.  In fact, when I
took my sons for a ride, one of the boys was drenched by the pool of
water the van had collected in the roof.  Is there a procedure to
diagnose just what is wrong with the drains?  Should one chase the issue
with a coat hanger?  Give the van a shot of Drano? Do a one legged
anti-rain dance? Or shall I simply invest in 3M knowing that I will
forever be buying Duct tape?

Thanks,
Mike
