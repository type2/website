Subject: Re: Tuning the Type 2 Operator
Date: Sat, 14 Nov 1998 17:17:49 -0600

&gt;&gt;So what do other type2 operators do to keep their blood temps and 
&gt;&gt;pressures down in traffic? Any tips will be appreciated.

Actually, I tend to slow down even more when the idiots speed by in their
go-carts, and love to make them madder if they already make their
displeasure obvious.  (I am obviously be careful about this in certain
metropolitan areas though.)  If someone's in a hurry -- and it appears that
most everyone is -- there's nothing I can do to make the world a better
place for them, so I just turn up the Dead and wallow in the knowledge that
I am enjoying the slow life, I'm seeing the world from up high, and I'm
doing my best to keep myself immune to the dangers of high blood pressure
by not driving one of those little cars.
