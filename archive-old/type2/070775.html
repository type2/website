A cry is heard throughout the land:
 
 &gt;   My '79 is having problems and I am writing the list to see if anyone
can..  HELP!!!!
 
The Symptoms:
   Bus turns over and starts, then has a high idle for 1 second and abruptly
stops.
   I can keep it going by giving it a little gas, but this causes the engine
to race at high RPMs.
&gt;   SO, needless to say it cannot be driven.

Easy one...you have a vacuum/air leak.....check the hoses that connect to the
intake &quot;boot&quot;..that's the big rubber snake from the aircleaner to the throttle
body....there are two or more hoses attached to it ..
However, the one to look for is the manifold connection for the power brakes
its..(Hmmmmm been a while)..on the drivers side between the intake runners?...
if you have had a back-fire, even a small one, the hoses pop off...check it
out..bring a light, and be glad it's not a 72 without the upper hatch!
