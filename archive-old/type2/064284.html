Subject: 80 Vanagon Sliding doorskin

Hi all,
I'm trying to find a lower sliding side doorskin for my 80 Vanagon.
It was fixed with fiber glass and not a very good job at that (rust 
coming through etc...). I've tried all the usual places including VW, and 
no luck.  I know this exists, Mill Supply in Ohio used to carry it Part 
#402-80-33 but when I called they said they no longer carried it. I've 
found all the used sliding doors that I want to carry home but I don't 
want to replace the whole sliding door, just fix with metal what I've 
got. I can fabricate out of sheet metal the piece that I need, but would
be a big time saver if I could get the skin all ready to rock and roll 
and weld....
