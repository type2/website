Subject: Want your fears proven???
Mime-Version: 1.0

I work for a FLAPS. I have a pretty good general knowledge of vehicles of
all makes and a good knowledge of a few. Imports more than domestics. After
witnessing several returns the other day on sales made by one of our
teenage employees, I commented to my wife, that you would think a FLAPS'
most important investment would be a good group of mechanics or former
mechanics as sales persons. Of course we all know better. 

The average customer only has a slight idea of what they need. Couple that
to the barest slightest knowledge of the employee of what the customer
needs and it is amazing anything ever gets done on these broken cars. (I
had to try - unsuccessfully - to convince one lady that her self described
fuel injected Chevy doesn't have a carburator! Another claimed he had a 4
cylinder V-6)

In my store, half of us work on cars for fun or necessity, the other half
is there for a paycheck and most of them are working their first job. Most
of them have only the sightest idea about what they are selling and if it
wasn't for the computer terminals, they could never fill the customer's needs. 

Scarey to say the least. Of course most of us would never find what we
needed in the average nationwide franchise type FLAPS as their inventory
doesn't service any make or model that there aren't millions of on the
roads today. If you drive something European (and not Mercedes, late model
VW, or BMW) or something a little unusal like the Corvair, you might as
well get out your catalogs. 

And for those of you buying alternators or starters or the like, pay extra
for the lifetime warratny. Most of these items are junk regardless of the
'quality' or 'warranty' of the part. We have many weekly failures right out
of the box - 'new'. This is what the FLAPS management want you to do but in
my mind it's the only way you'll still have a good part in five years. Not
a problem for the average driver who gets a new or used car every 2 years
but for people like myself who depend on their car to last and stay
reliable, you get tired of replacing the stupid alternaotr every 9 months..... 

And forget good advice. I am honest with the cutomers about their car's
trubles and if I lose a sale to a simple adjustment, then fine - I'm not
working on commission. A couple of us try our best, but the remainder of
the sales people are tying to fulfill promotional sales quotas and will
sell people whatever is on special that week. Our business is very good and
growing - could it last?

Oh by the way, ours isn't the only franchise with these problems, our
competition down the street has similar quality troubles.

This job will pay the bills until after graduation, but beware you drivers
of the uncommon and unusual....

My wife dares all of you to call a local FLAPS and ask for a 'GEOTHERMAL
PLUNKITY VALVE' and see what happens. I estimate 8 minutes or more to
realize there isn't such a part with a 1 in 7 chance that they will simply
tell you they don't carry those and refer you to the dealer.

Thanks for the bandwidth, just needed to vent a little hot air.

Take care all!
