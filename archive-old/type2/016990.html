&gt; I have found that the relay can fill with water and rust badly.

...a tiny aluminum-sheathed device once a crossroads for electrons but
now inhabited by a family of sea monkeys.

 It may
&gt; rust to the point that the headlights will fail. Mine would not click
&gt; from high to low. The reason they fill up is that the windows leak and
&gt; it drips in the relay and fills it up. 

As a tuft of wheat before the scythe or a meerkat gazing rapturously at
the headlights of a Kenworth... so is the wee baywindow headlight relay
upon discovery of it's new marine habitat.

This is a deffinate possibility
&gt; if you have a 68-71. The fuse box was mounted up higher and the relay
&gt; is bigger and mounted right under the window.
&gt; The other thing that can happen is the headlight switch goes bad.
&gt; Someone else mentioned it and concider this a second.
&gt; Look for a common denominator, the switch, the relay, the power to the
&gt; switch.
&gt; Check to see if it will switch from high to low, it may help you
&gt; narrow it down.
&gt; If they both go out at the same time it is most likely not the fuse,

good points... ahem. hurrah.

&gt; as there are two and they would not both fail and come back at the
&gt; same time, but it would not hurt to change them anyway, they are cheap.

yes... very inexpensive are the fuses.
The headlight relay in my '70 Westy failed before I purchased the
vehicle. Water entered the relay and rusted the pice of wire at the
bottom of the relay (on the inside) that is maybe a 3 to 4 inch piece of
wire bent into a hook-like shape on either end... it rusted it in two,
disintegrating the middle section of wire and most of one end.
	 One of the hook-like shapes was for a tension spring, and the other
was to do the switching of the actual contacts, back &amp; forth in a rather
ingenious way...
	So, after the sacrifice of one thick paperclip and an hour of tedious
bending and trial/error later, the relay was functioning perfectly again
with a new wire piece. The water had fortunately damaged only the piece
of wire, and not the electrical components of the relay itself. 
	Once it was all back together, I Permatex-3H'ed the top of the relay so
that I could continue to use it without worry until the windshield leak
is fixed... 
	It's a temporary fix, but may come in handy sometime to get someone out
of a jam.
