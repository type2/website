&gt; They are junk!  Mine broke in less than 1,000 miles.  They wore right
&gt; through the foot.  Really pitiful product all around.  Wish I had a
digital
&gt; camera to post pictures, I kept them for posterity sake.



I think this truly depends on where you get them and who made them.  I use
Gene Berg and have no issues work great. Of course $50 per set from Berg vs
$10 from Empi......
