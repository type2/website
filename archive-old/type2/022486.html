&gt;I read a post just like this a couple of years ago and decided to give it a
&gt;try.  I spent a lot of time tracking down the stuff and finally bought a
&gt;roll of it while I was on vacation up in Canada.  I was VERY DISAPPOINTED
&gt;with it.  It has a strong TAR odor and if the sun is out and the
&gt;temperature is above 70 degrees, the stuff softens up and RUNS.  It's also
&gt;very time-consuming and difficult to remove.

Hello all,

I've written several rants about NOT USING THESE PRODUCTS for sound 
deadening or insulation over the past 4-5 years on either the Vanagon or 
Type 2 lists (check the archives) which I will (happily) not repeat here.

The point is, these roofing underlayment products are meant to be used for 
just that--on the roof of a building ONLY. There are specific instructions 
on the package about not touching the product with bare hands, or breathing 
the vapors--in fact, the package specifically advises against installation 
(even on a roof!) without adequate ventilation.

One of the most frequently mentioned products in this category of 
self-adhesive membranes is Grace Ice and Water Shield. Here's the URL to 
the page at the Grace site that lists the Material Safety Data Sheet for 
the product. 
http://www.graceconstruction_dot_com/MSDS_download/Watprf/WPMemb.PDF Pay 
special attention to the sections titled &quot;Potential Health Effects&quot; and 
Carcinogenicity Information.&quot; There is a known link between skin cancer and 
the chemical compounds used in this product.

Folks, this is a fabulous product for sealing roofs and sidewalls on 
building exteriors and I have used it for years in the construction 
industry. But it is absolutely certain that the stuff does not belong in 
your living / breathing environments (aka, the inside of your bus).
