Please reply to Juan at: &lt;iguana_at_superestacion_dot_com.co&gt;.  I've directed him 
to the Type2 Archive and offered my own advice via p-mail.  I'm sure he'd 
appreciate some more input from type IV engine folks.

sorry to bother you, but I´m not sure who can help me with my question:
I have a 1973 westfalia, 2,000 c.c engine.
Last weekend I went to a place named melgar that it is about 3 hours from 
bogota (i´m located in colombia) when I was going there I had no problem 
with my engine. temp was between (180-220 degrees aprox) it went up 
sometimes but nothing to worry about.
when I was returning to bogota the trip is mostly up hill and my engine was 
trying to run hoter than normal, and it got almost to 260 degrees, so I had 
to stop twice to let the engine cool .
I was reading your info at 
&lt;http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/index.htm&gt;http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness&lt;http: 
//www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/index.htm&gt;/index.htm and I took some ideas from 
your page (thanks a lot) but I think I´m having a thermostat or reclicled 
air problem.
I also had the chance to read the page about cooling at 
&lt;http://www.type2_dot_com/library/cooling/coolsami.htm&gt;http://www.type2_dot_com/libr 
ary/cooling/coolsami&lt;http://www.type2_dot_com/library/cooling/coolsami.htm&gt;.htm 
and things seems to be ok.
the only think that is wrong is that the the aux heater fan is not ducted 
to the engine. so I´m thinking to seal completly that system cause I think 
I´m recicling hot air..
also I want to install a aditional oil cooling system.

my main quiestions are?
is it normal to get to that temperature going up in long hills??
any sugestions ??
any special model of oil cooler???
If you can help me, I really apreciate it, if not, please let me know who 
can help me.

thanx
