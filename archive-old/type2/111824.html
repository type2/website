Subject: Re: [T2] New welder-A done deal!

Hey bLowes has come out to CA of the past years and at
first sucked and i called them sLowes myself.. But in
reality they have gotten extremely better, and
actually have a nicer selection than home dumpo..
Cleaner, neater and most of the time better prices,
being in construction i used to love home dumpo, but
find myself only going there if i NEED to.. Besides
home dumpo for the first time ever has shown a loss of
30% a couple months back.. I think its because sLowes
is putting the hurts to them in Cali.

I was opting for the Lincoln 135 myself, let me know
how that welder of yours works out, you may want to
use shielded gas conversion.. much better..

peace,
rob
