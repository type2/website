&gt; Hmph.  It would appear from the bughaus pic that I in fact have the 6 to
&gt; 12 v bushing.  What manner of madness is this?

PO madness.

&gt; Pics of the 2 bushings I have:

That's the 6v-12v on the right.
 
&gt; The p/n of my starter is 311 911 023D.

That's a 71-75 starter.
 
&gt; I can't fathom that I would have anything that was originally 6V on my
&gt; '79.  

From the starter p/n I have to assume you don't have an 091 transmission on
your bus anymore (or at least you've got a flywheel smaller than 228mm and a
swapped bell housing, possibly a 6V one).

The bell housing part number is not visible from the outside of the case...
