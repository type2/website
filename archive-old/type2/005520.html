Chuck,
I was recently talking to David Raistrick about this on chat, as I bought a
Volvo with an inoperative sunroof and had fixed it.  The Volvo has the same
kind of sunroof as the Bus (Golde) except that the Bus roof is way longer
:-)

This sunroof is REALLY easy to fix.  Sounds to me like getting the silicone
off that the PO dumbass put on will be the hardest part.
I don't know why everyone bitches about fixing the sunroof but it is simple.

I think Bentley covers disassembly but even if not it is fairly
straightforward.  The sunroof operates thusly:

The hand crank turns a gear which sits in between two cables.  These are not
cables in the traditional sense that you would think of them (like a clutch
or throttle cable) but actually look more like a long spring stuffed with a
pipe cleaner.  The cables are spiral wound like a spring and sit
horizontally in their tracks.  When you turn the gear you are rotating the
cables in their tracks, and thus you get a screw-like motion from them.
There is of course one cable for each side.

Attached to the cables are rear guides for the sunroof.  The rear guides
slide in removable tracks.  The rear guides are part of the cable and also
bolt to the rear of the sunroof panel.  When you turn the crank, the
screw-like motion of the cable sends the rear guides and thus the roof panel
forward or backward on the track.

Also bolted to the front of the roof panel is a set of front guides.  These
simply ride on a track and are there only for location of the front of the
sunroof.

The rear guides also incorporate the lifters which lift the rear of the
sunroof into place when it is fully closed, with the cooperation of a couple
leaf springs attached to the roof panel.  The closed height of the rear of
the roof panel is adjustable via the rear guides.

When I started in on my sunroof, the roof would not respond to the hand
crank.  You have to get it open to really work on it, and a well-cushioned
screwdriver between the front of the roof panel and the body (from the
outside of the car) got it going enough for me to get my fingers in there
and push the roof panel back.  The silicone on yours adds another challenge
but I'm sure you can work through it.

Once you push the roof panel back a bit you can from the inside remove the
headliner panel from the roof panel.  It attaches at the front of the
sunroof, so just pop the clips out at the front like you were removing a
door panel from the door.
Then you want to push the headliner panel back a bit independently of the
roof panel so you can see the inner workings of the roof.

As you push the headliner back you should see the front guides, which you
can simply unbolt from the roof panel and remove (they come right off their
track when free of the roof panel) and set them aside. (I wish I had taken
pictures when I was working on the Volvo.)

Now you may want to get that headliner panel out of the way completely.
Push the roof panel back a bit and then lift up on the front and you should
be able to pull the headliner panel forward and out through the roof of the
car (not into the interior).

Now you can really get down to business.  Slide the roof panel forward by
hand (easy if the cables are broken.  If you can't do it, at least one if
your cables is OK) until you can see the rear guides.
If you can't slide the roof by hand because a cable is OK, simply remove the
hand crank, which removes the gear and then you should be able to slide the
roof by hand.  Unbolt the rear guides from the roof panel, disengage the
lifters from the leaf springs (you can swivel the leaf springs away from the
lifters) and then simply pull the whole roof panel out toward the front and
outside.  Might need a helper due to the size of the Bus roof panel but I
was able to handle the Volvo one myself.

If there is a wind deflector, you will want to remove it before removing the
roof panel.  On the Volvo, there are 4 screws that hold in the wind
deflector, and I needed my trusty 90-degree bent screwdriver for 2 of them.
Otherwise very straightforward to remove.

Now you can clearly see the tracks.  You may also see remnants of the
original slider blocks in the tracks.  If your slider blocks have
disintegrated, you need new cables.  On the Volvo, the original sliders were
made of nylon which had disintegrated and so the cables were fine but the
rear guides were no longer attached to them, so the roof didn't go.

The replacement cables I got from a later model Volvo had metal slider
blocks, which I was happy to see.

Once you've determined that you need new cables, here comes the easiest part
so far -- cable replacement.  You can't see the cables too well at this
stage of disassembly.  You'll notice that in the tracks where the slider
blocks slide, toward the front there is a piece that blocks the center of
the track so the sliders can't slide too far.  Remove these as they are held
in by only a couple screws each.  Now on the frontmost edge of the sunroof
hole in the body is a cable track cover which is secured with phillips
screws.  Some of them you already removed when you took out the wind
deflector.  Remove the rest of the screws and lift off the cable cover.

Now you can clearly see the cables.  Pull each cable end out of the cable
track area at the front of the Bus and then lift the tracks on the sides a
bit (now that you have removed the screws they are really not attached to
anything) and pull the cables out from the front of the Bus.

You can at this point remove the tracks and clean them up.  At the rear end
of each track is a plastic U-shaped piece with a projection in the bottom of
the U.  The 2 prongs of the U fit into the track and the projection fits
into a hole in the body.  This is to locate the track in the body.  You can
simply pull the whole track out and either the U will come out still
attached to the track or it will remain in the body.  Either way, you gotta
realign it when putting the track back in.  May take a few minutes of
cursing but it will go.  It's easier if the U stays with the track.  I had
one of each in the Volvo :-)  With the longer track in the Bus it may be a
bit of a challenge to realign it if the U stays with the body but you will
persevere.

Once you have cleaned up, regreased, and reinstalled the track, you can put
the new cables in.  You may want to lightly grease the new cables but they
are not under any real strain so don't overdo it.  The real lubrication
emphasis should be placed on the track where you have some sliding friction
in normal use.  Certainly grease the sliding blocks themselves.

Just put the new cables in the same way the old ones came out.

Reinstall the cable track cover.

If you are replacing seals, now is a good time :-)  I didn't have to replace
any seals on the Volvo roof.  Keep in mind that the seals will by design let
some water by.  Be sure that the sunroof drains are clear so you don't get a
shower inside the Bus.

OK, now slide that roof panel back in (a friend would help) and bolt up the
rear guides.  If the crank is out, reinstall it as you can now use the hand
crank to move the roof panel back and forth.  Leave the front guides off for
now.  Crank the roof back far enough to get the headliner panel in without
bending it too much.

Have a friend lift the front edge of the roof panel while you put the
headliner back in from outiside the car.  I did this myself with the Volvo
but with the larger roof and headliner on the Bus you might need two people.
Keep sliding the headliner back in even farther than the roof goes back so
you can access the front guides.

From inside the car, grease the tracks that the front guides slide on and
then reinstall the front guides.  Slide the headliner forward and clip it to
the roof panel.  Reinstall the wind deflector if equipped and you are back
in business.  Word of advice from experience:  do NOT try to reinstall the
headliner piece after you have already affixed the front guides.  Doesn't
work too well.

It is much easier than this e-mail made it sound.  I used a VW Rabbit Haynes
manual to remove the sunroof and found it all came apart and went back
together quite easily and intuitively.  If cables are available then there's
no real excuse to not fix it.  It's so cool to have that huge sunroof :-)

Wolfsburg West's price of $94 per cable beats Volvo's price of $120 per
cable for much shorter ones.  I got mine used.  By comparison, it almost
seems like you are getting a deal at Wolfsburg West.  Almost :-)

This was the first time I ever worked on a sunroof and I got it going.  I
was really wary of working on a sunroof because I thought it was some
difficult exotic thing but it turned out to be so simple that I was really
pleasantly surprised.  I wouldn't hesitate to do another one.

Good luck!

&gt; I have a 79 that has the sunroof siliconed in place. That in itself looks
&gt; bad and probably means the worst regarding fixing it.
&gt; I asked the local VW mechanic and restoration expert about helping me fix
&gt; it, and he informed me that the only time he threatened to quit working on
&gt; VWs was when the VW Dealer he worked for made him work on broken
&gt; sunroofs.....
