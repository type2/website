Subject: Steering column



77' westy, motor turns over with good compression.
afc fuel injection nightmare,best offer or interesting trade.
located in charlevoix, mi


Ah, Charlevoix.  Does that guy still have an Amphicar perchen on top of his
yatch?

Has anyone ever tried installing a non-VW steering column in their bus?  The
column in my 76 has a host of problems, some inflicted by me, others just
there.  I thought it would be nice to put in something different, tilt wheel
maybe!  Several reasons to do this.  I don't like where the key is.  My hand
is too fat to turn the key comfortably(I know, waaa).  I don't like the
placement of the wipers.  I need a new surround as I tore the other one off
not knowing how to get it off when I replaced the ignition switch.  And I
wasn't kidding about tilt wheel.  I saw it in a Corvair Greenbrier once, it
was a great idea.  So, any ideas?

Thanks.
