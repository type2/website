Subject: sparks over the gen

Hello Guys

I need some electrical help today, my car started to run erraticaly since
yestarday, I tough could be a carburation problem, but when I was adjusting
the carb I noticed some spark jumping from the 15 terminal of the coil
(bosch red with external ressistor) to the cable that goes to the dizzy, one
of the terminals was a little closer (the one that goes to the carb) so I
reposisioned then I noticed some sparks jumpimg among the wires over the
generator, somebody have any clue on this matter?

Thanks in advance

Roberto
