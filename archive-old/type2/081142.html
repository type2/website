Subject: BN4 Heat ducting

------=_NextPart_000_0020_01C1BDD8.FC613860
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Well folks I pulled my old engine this weekend and after beginning the =
gas heater install I realized that the main duct on my BN4 is for a type =
1 engine bus. (old firewall, etc.). I really need the duct from the =
heater that goes through the firewall with the thermostat for the bowden =
cable for a LATE BN4/bus. I just need this one piece. (I assume the late =
piece will work just fine with the early heater)

I have the early duct to trade or can buy the piece or trade for =
something else. Please help as I can't install my new engine til I get =
this heater in!!

Thanks
Rob Henley
