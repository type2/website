Subject: Re: [T2] Got an engine for my 71, lots 'o' questions!

Don,

Ditto from me also on the flywheel, but if it was done correctly, it would 
have been balanced while installed with the crank and pulley.

Gene berg sells a heavier pulley for folks with light weight 
flywheeels....you can read his take on why you need it and make your own 
decision.

I have a lightweight flywheel in a 68 bug.  I will never build a daily 
driver with one again....even though the 68 runs and drives like a top.


Cheers, dave

 Personally, I'd swap to a standard-weight flywheel unless the lightened 
 one was dynamically balanced to the crank .. this is a *Bus* not a 
 racecar and low-end grunt is more important than high RPMs.
 
&gt; Stock pulley can be used; I had a 12.5lb flywheel and stock pulley in my
&gt; Bug for years with no problems.  Tried one of the fancy aluminum ones,
&gt; went back to stock a few months later when it self-destructed from rubbing
&gt; against the filterpump (OEM, not CB)
