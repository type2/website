Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Sad, sad day for Lurch

&gt;I did a tune-up and oil change four times since the rebuild.
&gt;I had filings in the oil, but never excessively (I failed to test them for
&gt;ferrousness).
&gt;The spark plugs were always black!   There was still carbon on the pistons,
&gt;but it was flaking off.
&gt;I did switch carbs from a 31 PICT 3 to a 34 PICT 4 (?) about a thousand miles
&gt;before this calamity.
&gt;The 009 distributor was always set at 28 degrees at 3000 RPM (about 7.5 at
&gt;idle).
&gt;
&gt;The rebuilder suggested that I was either too lean are too retarded (the
&gt;timing).   He suggested timing it to 30 degrees or more.
&gt;
&gt;I monitor this thing to the nines.   RPM, oil press., oil temp., head temp.,
&gt;amps and volts, and never did any of these parameters go to extremes.
&gt;I realize that absolute values aren't much due to inaccuracy, but relative
&gt;values have been peachy through several engines.
&gt;
&gt;Mr. Mills, do you want to meet in Harriman to look at this thing with me?

&quot;MR&quot;? That's my Dad!!! &lt;grin&gt;

Yes I could meet with you maybe next week sometime. We still have only one 
car and the weather is not right for me and my motorcycle.

If the spark plugs were black then I doubt you were too lean. I think 
you've checked your well enough to know that that wasn't a problem.

I wonder if your rebuilders didn't have something too tight - not enough 
room for the oil to get between the crank and bearing to do it's job.

Do you have ALL of the tin in place and is it ALL real VW stuff (not the 
Taiwanese junk)? I had a Beetle that ran hot because of all the JC Whipme 
junk hung on it. I later found that the &quot;experts&quot; agreed that those fan 
shrouds did not have the proper baffles to direct the air to the right 
places. I knew from the get go that it wouldn't screw together and seal 
correctly.

I wonder if the rebuilder cleaned it properly after building it or if he 
checked ALL of the bearing clearances (sometimes bearing sets are not right 
or include different sizes). Has your engine block been align bored? That 
can open up ALOT more problems - especially if it was done incorrectly and 
the crank was no longer running parallel to the center of the engine case.

What about getting everything checked and measured by a different machine 
shop and then reassembling the case yourself? That way you could check all 
of the bearing clearances yourself.
