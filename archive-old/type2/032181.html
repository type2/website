Subject: carburator idle circuits

I've noticed something that I'm curious about, and I'm wondering if some
of you experts out there can explain it to me.  I've noticed that some
carburators have an air bypass for idling, while others just prop the
throttle plate open a little with an adjustable stop.   Why the two
different approaches?  It seems like the latter one is simpler, so I
assume there's some reason why it's better to let the throttle close
fully, but why?
