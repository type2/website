Subject: Re: [T2] The ideal VW motor replacement

Hi All, 

Those are called Deltic Diesel engines.   They were used extensively in
locomotives and ships for quite awhile.  Two crankshafts rotate in the
same direction, while the third rotates opposite.  Two stroke diesels,
with the porting in the middle of the cylinders handling exhaust/intake.
Extremely powerful engines.  Torque monsters.  Mechanically, they're a
nightmare of gears, and probably an absolute bear to get timed.
Generally, you would have banks of 6 pistons (one &quot;set&quot;, so it was 6,
12, 18, or 24 pistons.  

Hope it helps!

I have seen engines that were triangular shaped, 3 crankshafts, opposing pistons, with a big fan pressurizing the area inside the triangle.
I have seen them on the internets at least.
Very cool, does anybody remember what they were called, who made them?
