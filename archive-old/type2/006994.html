Subject: For Sale in Seattle - 1979 for $400 - help me get it to the right
	 person

Howdy Volks,

Wife and I are trying to get rid of our VW purchasing mistakes :)

 I'm asking a very fair price.  I believe in full descriptions, so here
goes...

1979 Type 2 passenger bus.
  -- Story goes: previous owner removed fuel injection and replaced with
carb.  This was the first bus we purchased, and I didn't even know about
Type IV engine being different :)  It wouldn't pass emissions here in
Seattle, so we took it to a local VW shop who worked the manifolds and made
it run really bad!  Now it isn't running right at all. I am clueless about
Type IV engines, carburetors, and... I just never had the interest in
learning Type IV, I find the older engines to be challenge enough!
  -- Body is in good shape, floors are great.  Front door window is broken.
Slider has a small dent.  Has some off-color spray paint over areas where .
VERY GOOD SHAPE.  No major dents, only surface rust in a few areas.  Nothing
serious.
  -- The engine:  the engine runs, it can be driven around in the parking
lot.  Transaxle seems perfect (all gears work, feel good).  Steering good.
Brakes work, but it has sat for 3 years... so assume no good.  ENGINE
PROBLEMS -- Missing some tin, everything and anything to do with the fuel
injection removed and replaced with a (improperly tuned) single carburetor.
  -- No middle seat -- well, actually I have a middle seat in storage -- at
least I think it is the correct middle seat for this bus.

$400 -- or best offer.  We need to get rid of it!  We are moving.  Please
help.  Any offer considered.  It can be driven short distances, but it is
running lean and will overheat.... I would say you can go 3 to 4 miles, take
a break, then go more.  Or I can have it towed to your place if you want...
I'll do it at my expense (AAA membership).

The engine does run - plus tranny good.  Running engine (core) and good
transaxle alone are worth $400, right?  Let alone the straight body.

Like I said, make an offer, help me out!

I can send digital camera photos...
