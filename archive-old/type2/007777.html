I don't know that there is a &quot;definative&quot; site but I know that the fellow from Oklahoma Josh...?? had a site that listed a number of the more common conversions.

Not only are there are those convertions but there are conversions that rarely made it over to North America such as conversions by Dutch Companies like Kamperink (s/) and Devon etc.
