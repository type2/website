Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] Tow Dolly

&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am planning on towing my '77 manual transmission bus about 50 miles on a
&gt;&gt;two-wheeled dolly, and wondered if I needed to do anything to protect the
&gt;&gt;transmission (besides taking it out of gear). Is it better to raise up the
&gt;&gt;front or rear? Thanks for any suggestions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
Take the driven (rear) wheels off the ground. Set the parking brake. Make
sure you check the tightness of the wheel straps after about 20 miles of
driving, expecially if it's raining - ask me why I know.

Good luck
