Subject: Re: [T2] Radio help?



&gt; Hi all
&gt; I'm trying to add a CD/Radio unit into my 79 Westy and
&gt; it seems that the cutout is a tad too small for a
&gt; standard unit to slip into. Anyone out there have any
&gt; thoughts on a solution (without cutting) that has
&gt; worked ...
&gt; Thanks in advance

My radios sit on the shelf I built under the dash, rather similar to 
the shelves on the splitties.

George
