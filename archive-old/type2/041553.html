Hey Shawn I'm looking into my crystal ball and something tells me your going 
to the rainbow gathering! Se ya there..no bus at foot..but it will be at GOTV 
this weekend.

Anyway mines a 71 I've taken it across country three times!!

I drove at night a lot after all we are 18 wheelers with 4 wheels, my engine 
appreciated this and seemed to drive better too

When I drive up long hills I shift down...more cooling less lag

WE rest after 3 hrs, check oil take a nap

Constantly keep everything in tune, especially valves!! 

I hauled 6 loaded boxes of tie dies plus camping equipment and about 100lbs 
of tools, drive sensibly, get speed before hills....

Don't forget to bring your camera

I'll be camped in Serenity Ridge playing my guitar, come find me!

        Andy
