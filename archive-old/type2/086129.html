Subject: RE: [T2] Tire Report 

&gt; Just purchased a set of Liberator truck tires in
&gt; 225/70/14 for my 74 bus from Walmart.  Paid $45
&gt; plus $7 for mounting and roadhazard.
&gt;
&gt; The load rating is adequate at 1625 lbs.  I have
&gt; them at 35psi which is the tire's max.



I am almost certain that these are not truck tires at all, but rather
standard passenger-car-rated tires that WalMart is marketing as fitting
light trucks. They do not have the C or D load range rating that is
recommended by VW for a bus.  I say this based on their low maximum psi
rating (below VW spec for a bus), and the fact that the WalMart site lists
them as a P series tire, not an LT series tire, despite their inclusion on
the light truck tire page.  You can confirm this by looking for a &quot;standard
load&quot; designation on the sidewall.
