I'm sorry.

&gt; i read the archives about how 009 are bad for busses but most of the 
&gt; vw's magz, most are running 009's including busses.

Good reason not to read the VW rags :-)

&gt; so, i have a couple questions: 1. why would my mechanic put a 009 in?

Either: (a) He didn't know what he was doing.  (b) He had it lying 
around and didn't want to expend the effort to acquire the correct 
part.

In either case, it's a good reason to find a different mechanic (or 
start doing more of the work yourself).

&gt; 2.  why are they so popular?

Actually, see (a) above :-)

&gt;  3. is there anything i cant do to correct the inherent problems w/ 
&gt; 009's?

Yes.  You can replace it with either the correct stock distributor, or 
a suitable replacement.  I installed an SVDA from aircooled_dot_net in my 
'76 and I love it (my original distributor needs a rebuild).

In any case, you should not run a 009 in a Bus.  Actually, I'm of the 
opinion that the 009 should not be used in *any* VW.  It was not a 
stock distributor on any VW engine.

&gt; one last thing,  since ive owned the bus, after being driven a little 
&gt; and i stop at the store or something, when i come back out, the bus is 
&gt; reluctant to start.  it always starts though with some effort.  is 
&gt; this normal?  even with brand new dizzy?

Not really normal.

If I were you, I'd get a proper distributor for your engine, plus a set 
of tune-up parts, and perform a tune-up / valve adjustment as the first 
step in trying to clear up this condition.  Eliminate those variables 
before hunting any further.
