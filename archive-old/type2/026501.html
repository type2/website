&gt;My oil pressure guage reads 60-80 psi. for the first five to 10 
&gt;minutes the engine is running.  Then it drops to the 20-40 psi. 
&gt;range and stays.  I can't decide if I have a bad sender or if my 
&gt;installation is causing the high readings.

That's very similar to what I get.  60 psi on startup (only ever saw higher
when temps were below 20 F.) and within 10 minutes of driving, I'm down to
40-50 and when I'm really warmed up and at cruising speeds I run around
35-40.  After extended high-speed driving (4000+ rpms sustained) on a warm
day I drop into the low 30's.
