Subject: Indicator arm is done!

Thanks for all the tips guys.
Jeremy, you turned out to be on the ball.
I had to buy an entire arm/switch assembly.
The steering wheel lifted right off, though, &amp; the
horn button  I could remove easily.
In fact, it was MUCH easier than replacing the starter
motor, which I've done before. 
For the record, the steering wheel nut on the '77 was
a 24mm nut.
In fact, I had to buy a socket especially to do the
job.
:-)
Cheers

&gt; Well, you probably already got it fixed, but i will
&gt; reply anyway. I have a 
&gt; 77 and the same EXACT thing happened to me a few
&gt; weeks ago. you have to buy 
&gt; a new turn indicator lever assembly. i spent about
&gt; 28 usdollars on one. 
&gt; then, you use a knife to pop off the horn button.
&gt; then, you use a 17mm 
&gt; socket (i think it was 17, maybe bigger) to undo the
&gt; nut in the center of 
&gt; the wheel. Then, you use your knees to pull the
&gt; wheel off. Then you look up 
&gt; under the plastic by your knees and see where all
&gt; the wires go. you pull the 
&gt; wires down, the old assembly comes off with just a
&gt; little patience. you 
&gt; slide the wiper switch off first. put the new lever
&gt; on, put the wiperswitch 
&gt; on, and reassemble everything. took me about 20
&gt; minutes, i would double 
&gt; check the torque setting on the steering wheel nut,
&gt; just to be safe. good 
&gt; luck!
