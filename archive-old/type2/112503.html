Subject: Re: paint code

John,

I wen't down to my local paint supplier and he had this gun looking thing that 
I think takes some kind of digital pic and then cross references it right 
inside the gun and will say in my case chrome (school bus) yellow. If somebody 
on the list cannot help check it out.
