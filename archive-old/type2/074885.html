&gt; I never took my bus through the CT inspection because it's over 25 years old.  As I recall, the dyno test takes less than one minute.  I doubt that your engine would overheat in that amount of time.  

CT and MD sound pretty close to identical, the machines/operators give you
an automatic second chance if you fail right away...I timed the car in
front of me and he  was in there on the rollers for over 5 minutes and
varying RPM.
