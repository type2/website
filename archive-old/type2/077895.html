Subject: Re: [T2] Driving with sliding door open, is it legal?

Well this thread probably won't last long either, but before its killed:

I am also in NC and all last Summer I drove with my sliding door open. I
never got pulled over for it, however you probably could be pulled over
whether its legal or not. When I had my Jeeps though I didn't have a top,
roof or even doors and that must be legal.

I don't know if you have a Vanagon or a Bay. If you have a Vanagon with the
shock type arms I would imagine they would wear out quicker. If you have a
Bay there are just 2 rod type spring things that flex to hold the hatch up.
I imagine the hatch wouldn't stay erect very long without some more support.
When I added speakers to my hatch it wouldn't stay up at all, so I used a
Westy table leg to hold it up. I just pop it open and screw the leg into the
cabinet:

That leg holds up terifically.

&gt; Hello list,
&gt;
&gt; I just had a quick little question. Is is illegal to
&gt; drive your bus with the back hatch up and /or the
&gt; sliding door open? I know that this is probably a
&gt; topic that is handled differently from state to stae
&gt; but I wanted to see what you  would say. Would driving
&gt; around with the bgack hatch up mess up its hinge
&gt; springs? Thanks!
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; I appoligize if this is a frequently asked question.
