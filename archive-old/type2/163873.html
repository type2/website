Subject: A Scary Moment

I had one of those heart in the stomach experiences this evening.  I
haven't set the valves (hydraulic lifters) in my Bus since installing
the motor 3 years ago.  I haven't yet put 12,000 miles on it but I
figured it was time anyway.  Also, I have some valves tapping and I
figured I'd try an adjustment to see if it cleared it up.  After
getting the valves adjusted to my satisfaction, I took it for a test
spin to gauge performance and also get it warmed up enough to get
passed the startup rapping.  Approximately a quarter of a mile out of
the driveway, the engine died - abruptly!  Needless to say, I was
crappin' myself.  The engine cranked and there were no odd sounds.  It
just wouldn't start.  Before walking home to get some tools (which I
took out of the bus and left in the garage), gas and my wife, I
checked under the hood only to find that one of the bails on the
distributor cap must not have been on well and the rotor knocked it
off.  The rotor and cap will need to be replaced ASAP but, the ol'
beast ran great despite the incident.  Schew!

As far as the adjustment, 1 exhaust valve (#1 cylinder) seemed loose
although it wasn't actually loose  2 other exhaust valves were close
enough that they just might not have been done carefully.  I'll keep
an eye on them though.  This was the first time I've adjusted
hydraulics.  It wasn't half bad.  I think I might prefer the
preciseness of solid lifters though.

Take care,
Ken -- very relieved!
