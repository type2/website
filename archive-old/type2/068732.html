Subject: Re: Battery Charging 

&gt;I drive my 78 (type-IV, FI 2.0L) to work and back every day, a
&gt;whopping 3.5 miles each way.  For all you disgusted bicyclers on the
&gt;list, sue me, I'm lazy.  Anyway, this means I'm starting my bus twice
&gt;from cold every 7 miles.  Now that the weather's getting cold, the
&gt;battery is acting sluggish, no big surprise.
&gt;

I drove mine the same distance all through a one hundred year record cold 
winter
with no problems with the battery. And there were quite a few hard starts
involved;-) 
However somehow VW seem to have a reputation for charging problems?
My fatherinlaw believes that you have to own a battery charger if you 
have a car. Even in his Jetta, and Passat he is always charging the battery 
even though there is no apparent reason. He can't believe that I don't
have a charger. He even leaves the dome light switched off, so it doesn't
ruin his battery? Where did he get this attitude? I don't know, but he
has been driving VWs since the mid 40's;-)
