Subject: Heater Box had no pipe attached!

hey now,

while doing my valves, i noticed that the pipe that is connected to the heater
box on the left (drivers side) wasn't attached. i reattached it.

i had noticed a lack of power and had thought i had a vaccum leak. after
driving it around, the power was back and the brakes didn't go as far to the
floor as before. i'm just wondering if reattaching the pipe fixed this or if
something i inadvertenly did fixed it. in looking at the other side, the pipe
is coming off of that heater box also. what exactly is the function of the
heater boxes and attached pipes? any insight would be gratefully appreciated.
