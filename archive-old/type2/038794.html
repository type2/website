Hello Vw-ers,
	I just have to get this off my chest, so bear with me.  For those of you
out there who don't regularly maintain your bus, please start.  And for
those of you out there who are maintanence gurus, thank goodness and keep up
the good work.
	Why this plea?  Well, it is very frustrating to work hard for three hours
on my bus and not even get one CV boot replaced.  I don't think the joints
had even been loked at in the 24 years of this bus's existance. They aren't
bad, but the hex bolts that hold them on are atrocious!  I blew out 2.
Aren't the joints supposed to be repacked every 18,000 miles?  Well, my
odometer says 96,000 and only about 10 miles are by me!  I have a few more
tricks up my sleeve that I will try later.

	On another note.  I am planning on taking a trip from Oregon to AK (my
home) as soon Nanook is finished this summer.  I know the basics, but I was
wondering what the special tricks and procedures are involved in surviving a
trip that long.  I am coming back, too, so I am looking at about 10k miles
or so.  I could tbe obsessing, but I believe in over preparation.

Thanks all,
Daniel Cathey III
