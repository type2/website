Subject: Re: [T2] Engine won't start - ideas?

Can you verify whether or not you're getting power to the coil? Pull out a 
plug, with the wire still on and the threads grounded to the exhaust pipe, 
have someone crank the engine...spark? If not, you might replace disconnect 
your coil and shake it around. You might have pieces of wire in their where 
your coil used to be...
Food for tought...

&gt;    Okay, the quick and dirty on this:
&gt;
&gt;    Few months ago the bus was sputtering and giving me lots of trouble, it
&gt;also was having problems starting.  It finally got so bad that it would
&gt;barely run, and I limped it home backfiring and sputtering.  I decided it
&gt;may be the charging system (starting trouble and perhaps low ignition
&gt;voltage) and upgraded to a Bosche alternator.  When putting the motor back
&gt;in, I found that the starter had dropped a bolt and was hanging down some,
&gt;which I think really was the cause of my starting trouble.  After getting
&gt;the system back together, it still would not run.  I replaced the coil, the
&gt;plugs, the wires, the cap and rotor, and even the points and condenser.
&gt;Still wouldn't start.  Replaced the fuel pump because the pressure was
&gt;really low (wouldn't really shoot fuel out).  Did a compression test and 
&gt;got
&gt;between 90 and 95 on all of the cylinders. Now, the motor will turn over 
&gt;and
&gt;over and over like it should...  it just won't attempt to fire.  I can get
&gt;the smell of fuel out of the exhaust when I pump the pedal a lot.  It won't
&gt;really pull much fuel into the filter though.  I tried squirting carb
&gt;cleaner straight down the solex, and still would not fire.  I started
&gt;checking out the valves, and here is what happens:  the motor will turn
&gt;nicely by hand until it gets to within 5 or so degrees of TDC... and then I
&gt;can't turn it no matter how much force I put on it.  The starter can turn 
&gt;it
&gt;over just fine though. The engine still will not run.
&gt;
&gt;For those not checking the signature, it is a '70 single port stock motor.
&gt;I don't have a lot of history on it, just drove it for about 2 months 
&gt;before
&gt;this happened.  I am going to go buy a Bentley for this van...  but I'd
&gt;appreciate some indications on where I should start.  Is the compression 
&gt;low
&gt;enough that I should just start a rebuild?  I'm really working on a budget
&gt;here if that helps decide direction.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks as always!
