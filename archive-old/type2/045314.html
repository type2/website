Subject: Re: [T2] Brake vaccum check valve thingy

I believe it's called a check valve, and it keeps a vacuum in the line
when the engine shuts off to give you a little assistance for a few more
brake pumps... i.e. when you stall, you can still stop :)

&gt; little arrow that points at the motor. What does it do? IIRC, Bentley
