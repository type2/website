Subject: Re: [T2] engine seal how to

Richard is right.  I did it and it is very, very easy and will  make a big difference in engine temp.  Buy one today!  You'll  see how it goes in when you get it.  You work it around from front  to back, IIRC.   Cheers...KR

You can do the Type4 seal with the engine installed all by yourself.
