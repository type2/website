&gt; I've developed a rythmic squeaking noise coming out of the back end of the 
&gt; 71 Westy, only happens when I'm accelerating, step on the clutch and it goes 
&gt; away. I'm a novice bus-owner. Any thoughts/advice?

Might be a dry or worn CV joint.  Time to learn about the greasiest job on
a bus!
