Subject: Rotating Seat

List,
I have in my possesion a device that is supposed to go under the
passenger seat to enable it to rotate. It looks like a typical VW seat
track with a round plate and handle. I have searched the archives and
have lokked at this thing for hours(well maybe one) anyway how the heck
does this thing work??? Is it for my bus (79 ) or is it for the
dumpster??? I can't for the life of me figure out how mthe seat mounts
to it. Am I missing parts?? The PO had it in the box of parts he gave me
( I inherited another of those unfinished projects due to wife, kids,
time, $$ etc)  I really want to make it work but am unsure of how.Please
advise.
Thanks

Kevin
