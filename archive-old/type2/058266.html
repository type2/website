&lt;&lt; Anybody know where the special tools needed to

apparant scarcity of used ones, and having a

it a go. I've  rebuilt many car, truck, and tractor tranny's, 
but never one needing all  the fancy tools before.  &gt;&gt;

If you've done those transmissions then the VW 
shouldn't present too much of a problem, however, 
for the basic tools that *will* be required you'll spend 
almost the same as you would on a quality rebuild.
Off the top of my head just the bare bones that 
you'll need assuming that you already have a good
metric tool selection would be in the neighborhood
of $400+.  Then you'll have to purchase the parts
that need to be replaced.  It might even be more
expensive to do just this one yourself than to have
a professional builder do it.  Now, if you are planning
on doing this on a regular basis then it could make
sense to sink all that cash into speciality tools.  I
am not trying to talk you out of this but these are
fairly expensive tools that can only be used for
one particular job.  Heck, I'm willing to turn a profit
by selling you the tools or by rebuilding a gearbox!
So, to make a long answer longer, you can purchase
from me or any of the other Transaxle speciality shops
listed in the ads in the back of hotVW's or VW Trends.
