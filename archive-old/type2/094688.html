Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical woes... still

The circuitry of the relay shown in that link is basically what is in 
the double relay fuel pump side with the exception of the timer 
circuit .  The timer circuit is probably in a control module.  If i am 
reading that circuit correctly what it is looking for is a changing 
state (ie the trigger of firing from the points) to keep the timer 
going.  If it goes to a constant state the 555 timer will have not 
trigger and shut off the pump.  One lead from the coil is supposed to go 
to the double relay.

&gt; I read in the type 2 library ( http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/relay.html

&gt; this relay the coil should be in the circuit. (Just applying 12V to the
&gt; trigger input is not enough. The circuit relies on the higher voltage 
&gt; pulse
&gt; that is generated by the coil when the points open.) could this be why I
&gt; have an empty male spade connector on my coil?
