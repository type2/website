&gt; If my speedo is accurate, my stock '79 Cali. emissioned  kombi can  
&gt; achieve
&gt; around 90 mph. on the flats. I know this can't be, because the  
&gt; computer cuts
&gt; out the ignition at a pre-determined RPM thereby limiting the speed  
&gt; to,
&gt; according to the owner's manual, 75 mph.

The Federal model owners manuals also give 75mph as the max but the  
actual maximum would be around 100mph if you multiply 5400rpm * tire  
height / gear ratio etc.

&gt; Here in Alameda, the speed limit on almost every street is 25mph,  
&gt; and there
&gt; is an over-abundance of those active speed limit signs that display  
&gt; your
&gt; speed. At the radar speed of 25 mph my speedo reports 29 mph. I  
&gt; have stock
&gt; wheels and the correct tire, worn to about 20% of remaining tread.  
&gt; I think
&gt; my speedo is highly optimistic.

Mine is a little faster judging by those signs also.

Given that error amount, I know I can still push my bus past the end  
of the speedo on a long steep downhill which again is greater than  
75mph in the owner's manual.
