Subject: Re: [T2] Interior roofing

&gt;Won't the hot glue fail the first hot day next year?

Nope, the stuff is pretty resiliant. And once the white board is secured the 
stuff won't be going anywhere.

&gt;Contact cement would be better.

Problem is that it's a mess to work with and a real pain to clean up. 
Someone mentioned that a future owner might want to change things.. contact 
cement &lt;ick&gt;


&gt;Wood paneling or vinyl covered foam would look better IMHO. Same with the 
&gt;OEM style headliner. Just my opinion.

Yah, I see a lot of people like the wood look. Personally, I removed all the 
wood panelling and would never reinstall it.  I find it looks ugly. The 
white panelling looks brighter, cleaner and more stylish to me. For the 
roof, wood..naa.  When I am done I will take pictures for everyone.

Interesting enough I've gotten lots of comments on what I should and 
shouldn't put up but what I was originally wanting was 'how' the stuff is 
secured to the roof.   Another thing I noticed about the old van roof is 
that it gets skinnier near the front and near the back. The middle is wider. 
Talk about a potential pain to precut something ;)  Maybe this weekend 
between Turkey dinners I will figure something out.
