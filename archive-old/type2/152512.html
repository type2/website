Subject: Unplugging the type 1 intake manifold : the bum's method

Please find the procedure below, the good stuff come after some
useless chatting. There is nothing new here except that the procedure
is 100% recycling.

1) Buy a Kawasaki Ninja 1994
2) drive it for 19'500 trouble free miles
3) when the battery starts to fail in late November 2005 buy a new one
at Kragen for 35$, select a Champion battery that comes dry, with a
bottle of acid to fill it in the kit.
4) fill the Champion battery and charge it
5) install the new battery and enjoy the japanese bike for hopefully
another couple thousand trouble free miles
6) keep the extra sulfuric acid that came with the battery and wonder
how it could be used wisely. Keep thinking about it for a few days.

7) hold the manifold upside down in the vice (yes the engine typically
needs to be pulled to do this)
8) pour some sulfuric acid in the plugged heat rise (you want to have
goggles on and watch  your skin)
9) have a nice week
10) come back and remove the acid and the ton of carbon that comes out of it
11) go back to 8 until manifold is clean or there is no more sulfuric acid.

Yes the aforementioned acid allegedly digs holes in the skin if one
lets it do it. However it does not seem to make my manifold rust.
