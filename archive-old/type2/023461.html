Subject: Need Help fast FI to Duals!!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I finally got the new motor in and now have the spaghetti and other odds and 
ends to connect.  The old fuel injected motor had one line (from what I see) 
that ran from the braking system up front to the rear.  The new motor has two 
inlets for a vacuum hose to go, but I only have one.  If you are looking at 
the motor from the back of the bus, there is one line directly behind the 
left carb going out the tin to meet the vacuum line.  But to the left 6 
inches the pipe Y's off for another vaccum line to be connected.  What gives. 
 What do I need to hook up and can anything be plugged safely or??  I need 
help fast as it is 1am here and night there so I'll be hanging out waiting 
for some help so I can hopefully start this bad boy up tomorrow.  Also the 
old throttle cable came out the right side of the transmission (once again 
looking at it from the rear, and the new one needs to run on the left side to 
hit the dual carb linkage,  but when I ran it threw the holes it definitely 
was to short, no big deal....but there was a hollow steel tube welded to the 
housing, do I need to make another one for the other side or can I just let 
the throttle cable have some slack and but it up against the hole that's 
designed in the tin for the new motor??  Please help if you can,  I need to 
get out of town and go CAMPING....
Peace Out
