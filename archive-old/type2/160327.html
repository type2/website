&gt; Some may gripe about older low tech vehicles breaking down quite often, it 
&gt; is true they need more TLC than a modern vehicle. That said however, the 
&gt; problems can often be fixed at the side of the road without the aide of computer 
&gt; diaognostics. We could all drive new, modern, oiltight, reliable and totally 
&gt; bland vehicles, but what fun would that be?
&gt;

The trouble is no auto company wants to make modern, oiltight, reliable, and
totally bland and relatively less expensive vehicles...You've got to sell 
hundreds
of thousands of under $20,000 cars to make what the industry considers a 
profit.
Even the Korean companies are having trouble with low priced cars...The labor
costs have risen (a rising standard of living includes rising wages...)
