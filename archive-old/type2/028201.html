Well, I removed the engine to fix my fan belt misalignment and decided to 
replace the pushrod tube seals etc... while I had the engine out.  Surprise! 
  It looks like I've got the beginnings of worn rings on #3 cyl.
There has been no indication of this (the usual tick,tick noise or excessive 
oil burning/consumption) and compression at last check was 130 all around. 
The engine is a scrap yard special that has been babied for approximately 
25,000 miles.
My question to the list is, do you recommend making the quick fix, or is it 
a good time to invest in a quality rebuild?
I understand that there are many factors to consider here ie. time and $$$, 
but I'd appreciate any input.
Also, any thoughts pro or con on a 1641/1776 rebuild?  The thought has been 
kicking around in my gray matter for some time.

Thank you,
Scott Moeller
