the spark plugs are actually two different sizes! i can't remember exactly
what they are but the numbers on the side of the plugs is different.  i also
have to use a different size compression test adapter to screw into the
sparkplug area. the heads to them are physically different in size and the
threads.   

Thanks,

Rawls Moore

&gt; my first question: does it matter that the sparkplugs are two different

What do you mean by 2 different sizes,,, the threads are physically
different,,
or the heat range is different,, on thread is longer than the other,,,

Can you send the actual number off the side,,, like Bosch W8CC  or, W225T2
or
champion L88 or what ever,,,those numbers are for a T4 engine,, not a T1 as
you
have,

What My guess is that you have an insert that has come out with the
sparkplug,,
and if you read the plug number, they will all be the same.
