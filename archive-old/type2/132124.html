&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; OK, I think it would be wise for me to ID some of the parts I am
&gt; working with.

Don't you do this part before you put them on the engine? Whoops, dumb
question.

&gt; 
&gt; Here are the part numbers for what I'm working with:
&gt; 
&gt; AFM:
&gt; 0 280 200 020

That is 78-79.

&gt; 
&gt; ECU
&gt; 0 280 000 149

This one is hard to reference because you are quoting the bosch number. The
bosch book I have is too new and the ECU's are not in it any more. I'll bet
Karl would have a reference for it. If you use the VW number, which should
be on the same sticker as the bosch number, it is easier to ID. Here is a
good listing of the VW ECU numbers and applications. Ignore the X's, they
only denote remanufactured units:

&gt; 
&gt; Distributor
&gt; 0 231 168 005
&gt; 021905205P

This is here:

I would say that is a good distributor to use on your franken-motor. You
have no use for retard and no port to generate a retard signal, and the
motor you are trying to build is basically a 78-79 one with the exception of
the solid lifters.
