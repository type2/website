Subject: Consider this repair

On my 83 Westfalia Air Cooled I'm about to repair (restore cause it isn't
broke) my rear swing arms bushings, rear axle bearings and seals, new
wheel cylinders, brake shoes and brake lines.
I've got a complete extra pair of swing arms with every part required so
I can rebuild the off the car set inside my warm garage and then just
install them on my Westy when the weather gets better. 
This sounds better to me than restoring the existing set that is
currently on the van. 
Other than having to go to the local heavy truck repair center to get the
axle nuts properly torqued this procedure looks practical to me.
The current swing arms appear to be very straight and the tires are
wearing normally..... now the question.
How do I check the surplus swing arms and axle alignment with the
assemblies off the vehicle?
They came to me loose so I never saw them on the previous van.
Hopefully I'll never have to restore these assemblies so I'll have the
old undamaged units for sale cheap (if the rebuilt replacements are true
and align properly).
