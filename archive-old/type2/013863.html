Subject: Re: [T2] more manifold problems

Someone suggested to JB weld the stud in.  That makes
it a permanent fixture, but does that really matter? 
Thank you for the help.  I usually look through the
archives on stuff like this, but they are still down.

&gt; &gt;I got all pipes filed true, but have encountered a

&gt; me
&gt; &gt;about this a couple of years ago.  Said I have to
&gt; &gt;remove the engine to retap the hole.  It threads,
&gt; but
&gt; &gt;slips at the end when I apply moderate torque. 
&gt; Does
&gt; &gt;lock-tite work in a situation like this?
&gt; 
&gt; Locktite won't help much.  You don't have to remove
&gt; the engine to make the 
&gt; repair though.  There is lots on this in the
&gt; archives, but in case they are 
&gt; still not available you can either get a helicoil
&gt; kit for it or tap 
&gt; oversize (9 or 10mm, I always do 10mm) and use a
&gt; stepped stud.  Finding the 
&gt; stepped studs can be difficult but they are out
&gt; there.
