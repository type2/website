Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Westy 2.0L engine weak fire

You said you checked the head sensor &amp; it checked ok, but said that as
it warms up it dies. The bentley specs call for testing IIRC cold
engine &amp; ALSO running temp. Was the engine at a good temp for your
second reading?

&gt; may be causing this. All answers appreciated. Thanks
