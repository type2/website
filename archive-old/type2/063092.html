They're just outside of Erie, Colorado.  As of about eight months ago,
they had two splits that were being parted out.  The other thirty or
so had already been stripped (so they claim, wouldn't let me look),
and were being used only for storage.  Stripped, in this case, does
not include glass or doors -- sheds need to be moderately weather-
proof, after all.

Some parts have been stockpiled, but it's rather a disappointing place
to visit.
