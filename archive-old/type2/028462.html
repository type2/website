I agree completely that putting a type 1 in a late bus is pure folly.

I also agree that a *stock* type 1 is underpowered and won't last as long as
a stock type 4 engine.
Now my very un-stock 1776 type 1 in my 71 bus is *real* strong after ~80K
and I bet I make it to 200K no problem.

I'll race ya Rick ;-)

There should have been numerious articles on the subject.  In short, don't
do it!!!  You will be money, time and fewer headaches ahead if you just put
a type 4 engine back in.  The type 4 engine is superior to the type 1,
that's why VW went to them.  Not only that, but you will have to redo the
engine tin and fabricate a rear cross member, which in itself will take you
bunch of time and money.
