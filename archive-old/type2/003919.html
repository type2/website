I pulled the ignition switch out of my 77 bus today. I will order a new one
but I am curious if there is any way to test it with a meter to find out
what the problem might be. Could I do a continuity test on the brass  strips
while turning the little slot on top? Also when I accidently connected the
black wire to the red/black wire my starter worked!
thanks
eric
