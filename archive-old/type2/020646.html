Gail,
I have a 72 so my luggage rack is in the back, but you may be having the same problem I had.  I replaced my pop top seals and still had the howling winds in my bus.   I couldn't see where the problem was coming from until I removed the canvas one day.  I had a gap about 1/4 inch high right where the luggage rack meets (or fails to meet) the roof on the inside of the bus.  Once the canvas was gone, I could see daylight coming in from under the roof rack.

To fix this problem I bought some closed-cell foam weather stripping at the local hardware store.  Then I removed the roof rack and stuck this weather stripping to the underside of the roof rack on the side that faces to the inside of the bus.  I reassembled the whole thing and found that I have greatly reduced the the howling winds that once ripped through the interior of my bus.  I'm not sure about a 75, but on a 72 you want the other three sides of the luggage rack open to permit rain and snow to drain away.

Hope this helps,
