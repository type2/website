Subject:  [T2] RE: Gas heaters again. Wanted heater exhaust 

It was asked:
&gt;&gt;Anyone know where I can get a new exhaust pipe for
the gas heater. Mine isgetting pretty rusty.
Although I seldom use it as I don' t drive it in the
winter anymore, I'd
like to replace it, because its
about the only thing on my van that's not up to spec,
and I sort of like to keep it all up to spec.

Years ago, we had a 68 VW bus, and it was our only
family winter transportation, and our three boys were
all pre-school age.  Being an old used bus, it had
poor heat via the heater box arrangement, but a friend
who does foreign car work suggested using a gas
heater, so he sold us one that he had modified by
welding on a stainless steel flange and exhaust pipe
to replace the stock rusted one.  We mounted the
heater under the front of the bus, under the front
seat passenger's feet, with some of the parts under
the pedal cover under the bus.  It worked great--all
that hot air right up front where you wanted it.  Got
rid of the bus after awhile as it was rusty and
primered and so ugly that friends would ask us to park
down the block instead of infront of their house when
we would go to visit.
Kept the heater, though, and maybe will use it again
some day.  I took photos of the installation, and will
have to try to dig them up sometime.
