Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel smell and replacing rubber filler neck

Hi Timo,

It is possible to remove the tank without dropping the engine. ALL of  
the FI parts will need to be removed in order to get enough  
clearance. But in my experience you may need to remove the rear  
hanger bolts and allow the engine to sag about an inch or so. I know  
that was the case with my 1.7L engine when I last dropped the tank in  
2000.

Once you have the FI removed and the firewall out, the rest is pretty  
simple. Strong and flexible hands are a big asset when working on the  
tank, it's not east to get at.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Question:
&gt; Since I currently have no way to drop the engine, remove the tank  
&gt; and do
&gt; this job properly, I want to do this with the engine installed.
&gt; - Can I remove the firewall this way (removing carbs and air intake)?
&gt; - Will I have enough space to replace the hose from the tank to the
&gt; metal filler pipe? I think it is not leaking, but I want to replace it
&gt; anyway.
