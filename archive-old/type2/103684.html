Subject: Mirror arms and stuff

    The new repo mirror arms have just arrived from europe. These are EXACT
copies of the 59 to 67 arms for the round mirrors. These were made off of a
set of NOS ones that I have.
    We also just recieved original style hub cap clip rivet tools, that were
also made of of an original OG tool.
