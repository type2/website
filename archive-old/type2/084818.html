&gt;I thought I would share a good story,
&gt;
&gt;I got a call from Henry yesterday. He was looking for a transmission for his
&gt;1970 bus that's in Indonesia. While he is in the states, 10 days, he has
&gt;been visiting family in Denver and is leaving tomorrow.  Wow.
&gt;
&gt;I have been to south east Asia but never Indonesia my girl friend has and
&gt;she said she loved the people and I now know what she means. Henry came by
&gt;with his wife and brother and talked shop for a while. Turns out he runs a
&gt;bus club there. After some small talk we get to business,.... bargaining.
&gt;This guy could talk a turtle out of his shell. We'll I wont tell you what a
&gt;deal I ended up giving him but, I will tell you that, in the end, I got a
&gt;great deal of satisfaction out of it. Henry agreed to take a trans out of a
&gt;'75 engine fire bus we have. Turns out his 1970 has the later style trans
&gt;hangers, also '68-'72 front but '73-'79 air intake vents on the rear
&gt;corners. We both figured that the fire killed the bus the bus and the trans
&gt;was probably good. So we pulled it up to the door and off he went, oh, yeah
&gt;don't forget that he is flying back tomorrow! His wife and brother went off
&gt;to the mall for some shopping, I gave him some tools and  coveralls, he
&gt;gives me his t-shirt (it was from a vw show in Indonesia). Cool!
&gt;
&gt;In order to fly with the trans Henry takes it apart. Everything, This was
&gt;his first time taking one completely apart too. He used the throw out fork
&gt;to remove the adjusting rings!   The whole time Henry comments on all the
&gt;parts that I am packing for the days orders, he knows years and all the
&gt;stuff to look for and he also over hears some trouble shouting Blake and I
&gt;have about his dist. and make a comment. I told him to come back and work
&gt;for us the next time he's in the states. He declines as he has a great job
&gt;making transformers for the company that makes those fast trains in France
&gt;and has an engineering degree.
&gt;
&gt;Well Henry's wife is back from the mall and it's getting late, she asks him
&gt;to finish up and helps us gather parts into small boxes and into the car. We
&gt;shake hands and shear smiles, I get invited to Indonesia when things settle
&gt;down and Henry promises to keep in touch. Here are some photos of Henry
&gt;pulling the trans.

&gt;
&gt;Please send a warm welcome from the list to Henry (henry_volksw_at_yahoo_dot_com)
&gt;in hopes of getting him to join the list, he would be a great resource for
&gt;technical bus stuff and that good old vw spirit. Take care, have a safe trip
&gt;and good luck getting that thing through airport security.
