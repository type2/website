wade-
this would seem to indicate another type of starter malfunction,
where the starter actually tries to engage on the first try.
but hangs up on the flywheel, doesn't turn it, and doesn't
retract. that would indicate an alignment problem between
the flywheel and the starter &quot;bendix&quot; drive. this problem will
also respond to the short circuit path of battery to starter
motor winding as well as battery to solenoid , to free up the bendix.
if your starter has the trans support bushing,
this should be checked/ replaced and the flywheel teeth should
be examined. occasionally the starter will lock in this open
position, and, should the engine start, the starter can remain
engaged, and then continue to turn while the engine is running.
( and continue to be overrun while you are driving)- and you may not
notice it until you turn off the engine and find the starter is still
running and the only way to stop it is to disconnect the battery.
the cheaper off-brand ( not Bosch ) starters often have a different
tooth pattern on the starter gear that tend to grind the flywheel teeth
into a new shape. the occasional &quot; buzz &quot; where the starter fails to
engage the flywheel also leaves damage on the flywheel teeth and
can further exascerbate the problem .
