Subject: Re: TYPE 2 fishing whizbang!

This is Friday, right?

My uncle and cousin experienced a wizbang.  On a fishing trip, crossing a
farmers field to get to the stream of choice they paused near what was
thought to have been a very long row of brambles to, um, er, uh, &quot;wiz&quot; - not
noticing that the brambles covered an electrified fence - hence the term . .
. &quot;wizbang.&quot;

OUCH!

&gt; The Neandereers should have gone on strike when marketing said, &quot;Make
&gt; wizbang or else!!&quot; They should have had the strenght of conviction to
chose
&gt; else. &quot;To hell with your wizbang, or else!!&quot;
&gt; That they knuckled under and gave in just demonstrates they are as human
as
&gt; any other ape, and knew not what they did.
