Subject: Re: [T2] Starts right up and stalls (still looking)

&gt; 75 FI bus started right away and then died within 1 or 2 seconds. This 
happens &gt;over and over. I tripple-checked all vacuum hoses (especially the 
one to the brake &gt;booster in the area where I was working) and everything is 
in place. I also &gt;confirmed that there was gas in the tank.

May be a bad ignition switch which allows current to flow while in the 
cranking position but looses continuity as the switch returns to the run 
position.
Check the coil for voltage after it quits, if no voltage or very low voltage 
replace the ignition switch.
I had this problem once.

Good luck.
