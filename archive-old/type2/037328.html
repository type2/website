greetings
i have not been on the list much in the last month or so.  i have missed
reading all the posts, but spring-time is almost here, and i am currently
finding i could use another 5 hours of daylight each day to do all the
landscaping/lawn care that is available.  

hope my 73 van ($400) found in a farmers field in western nebraska, will
continue to be a work-horse as i haul dirt, trees etc all over town.  i was
able to make some decent trades this winter and round-up a number of parts
to make her as road-worthy as possible, (of which we all know is part of an
on-going maintenance schedule)...not sure how long i will stay in *lurk*
mode until i finally have to unsubscribe as the posts begin to pile up.

anyways...i was flipping channels a moment ago, and saw a brown/white bay
window being used as a shield in a police stand-off in southern-cal. 
nothing like a big barn shape of a bus for a half-dozen officers to hide
behind!!

happy bussin' to all, hope your lights are all green as you travel this
summer.

**as to the dual-carb web-page idea....lets just say, the amount of support
was quite small.  nothing ever materialized.  i guess i am the second listee
to try to round up support for a page of this sort.  i wish the next person
the best, we (this list) could really really really USE a good stock, solex,
dual-carb (72-74 bay's) web page with good tech info and an assortment of
quality photos.  anyone who has spent the time to rebuild, re-jet and tune
those dual-carbs..knows that it is a time comsuming process, and that is if
you know what you are doing.  but the results are incredible.  the bus runs
FANTASTIC when those carbs are tuned perfectly.
