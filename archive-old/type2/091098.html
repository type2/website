&gt; This varies tremendously by state!  It is very local and something that

&gt; bus &quot;totalled&quot; inquire locally before you sign anything!

I can see how it could vary from locality to locality.

Hereabouts, the declaration of &quot;salvage&quot; involves transfer of title to a
vehicle dismantler, not any transaction involving an insurance company.
