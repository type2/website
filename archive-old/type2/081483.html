Subject:  VWOA Trademark

&gt;  From a kid who saw an indian peace sign at a museum and then drew it on
&gt; a notebook in 6th grade and got called a nazi, goodnight.


The indian peace sign is the swastika in reverse.  There was a car in the
early 1900's called the KRIT, and the logo they had on the radiator shell
was this indian peace sign.  Of course no one thought anything of it at the
time.

There is a 1913 KRIT in the National Automobile Museum in Reno, NV.  The
KRIT is the first car you see when you enter the collection; it is a
beautiful car.  People are constantly insisting that the insignia on the
radiator offends them and demand that the car be removed.

The collection also has a marvelous red 64 Beetle convertible.
