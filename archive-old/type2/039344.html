Subject: Re: My (mostly) successful return home

FWIW ......
When I picked up my '72 van and drove away after an engine install I turned left
at the corner ( it was raining so I had the wipers on ) the left rear hubcap
came off mid turn, rolled across the street and got run over and the driver's
side wiper got caught on the windshield gasket and came off and I ran over it.

Good idea tearing down to engine core as a training aid !

&gt; My only problem was getting home and seeing a chrome wheel cover
