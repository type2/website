Subject: Re: Is this bad?

&gt; From: Robert Meyer &lt;njmr0021_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The other day I went to pull out my E-brake and instead of it going 
&gt; out about 4 or 5 inches, which is what it normally does, it went out a 
&gt; good foot.  Does that mean it's broken?  It still prevents the bus 
&gt; from moving when pulled out, and nothing seems to be wrong with it, 
&gt; but it made a rather loud bang when I pulled it out that time, so I 
&gt; got a little worried.
&gt;
I suspect one of your cables broke or popped loose from the actuating 
lever (inside the drum).  Put the e-brake on and jack up the rear 
wheels -- might be only one of them is actually holding; if so, there's 
your culprit.  You can also crawl around under there (car on ground!) 
to see if one of the cables is slack.

If you're lucky, maybe one of the cables just came off at the front 
adjustment point, but I doubt it.  Try to isolate the problem to one or 
the other side.  You'll have to pull the drum if the cable is broken or 
has come off the rear attachment.
