 Anyone know where I can buy a new or remanufactured brake servo for a 71
 Westy?  Mine leaks and causes my engine to stall every time I use the
 brakes.
  &gt;&gt;
California Imports  www.vwcalimports_dot_com sells remanufactured ones for 
$169.95.  $75.00 core charge.  If they handle them then others must also.  
Check around you will probbly get a better price.
