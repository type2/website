Subject: Re: [T2] symptoms, why my bus won't start, compensating for
  vacuum leak?

&gt; Found a disconnected hose while

Brake booster hose.

&gt; front lower drivers side corner. The tube runs to a rubber T that plugs in

Connect to air plenum and...

&gt; while another braided hose goes
&gt; up from the T to this flying saucer looking thing that is in the front top

.._dot_decel valve. That hose should be plastic so it can't collapse under
vacuum.

&gt; found 
&gt; another problem hose. Out of that flying saucer looking thing comes a black
&gt; rubberhose shapped like a U.

This hose is NLA.

&gt; This hose connects to a Y shaped plastic
&gt; fitting. This Y isplugged into the big S shaped black hose that is connected
&gt; to the intake air sensor box that is connected to the air filter.  still
&gt; with me. ok. There is one more rubber hose that is attached to this Y it
&gt; runs down to a rubber elbow, that attaches to something I don't know what
&gt; is,
&gt; that attaches to a braided hose, that attaches to the engine on the
&gt; passenger side in the rear towards the top (pretty much on the opposite side
&gt; from where the rubber T connects.

Auxiliary Air Regulator.

&gt; The rubber elbow had split entirely up the side. Funny though, because the
&gt; rubber seemed to be in real good shape otherwise. Anyways, I wrapped it real
&gt; good in electrical tape and wrestled it back in place.
&gt; Tried to start it. Real rough start, sounded like it might have backfired
&gt; twice real quick and then died. never really idled. Tried to start it again.
&gt; nothing. nothing again. then let it sit a couple minutes then try again.
&gt; Real rough start, sounds like backfire or something. Then dies almost
&gt; immediately. No chance to even try to give it a little gas. try to start it
&gt; again, but nothing. walk away. drink beer.
&gt; So, that brings me to today.
&gt; I was wondering, if the broken hose would cause a vacuum leak and if
&gt; everything was set to compensate for that, and if so, what do I need to
&gt; adjust to get it started again, or if not what do I do.

The engine can't compensate for a major vacuum leak. A minor one yes but
you'd have to advance the timing/rpm and that only masks the problem.

Based on this experience I would say you still have major vacuum leaks
preventing you from starting the engine.

Check the S-shaped boot for cracks. Check the oil breather hose for cracks.
Check the rest of the hoses:
