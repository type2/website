Subject: [T2] Charcoal filter?

Hello, All-
Just above the right rear axle on my '82 Vanagon there is a mounted upright
canister with 2 air hoes, one leading to the paper air filter, the other one
connecting directly into the cooling housing. I believe it's a charcoal
filter of some kind, mentioned in passing only in Tom Wilson's book, not in
Haynes or in Bentley.
My question is: does this require any sort of routine
maintenance/replacement? What exactly is its function?
TIA

Carlos
