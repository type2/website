I've pulled out dist shafts from diff rebuilds and put them back in with no
prob. Usually pull them out when someones put them in 180 out. As long as you
line every thing up correctly the shaft slides right in and engages the dist
gear with no prob. If you make sure #1 _at_ tdc on comp stroke and notch on pully
_at_ case half the shaft should fall in with the notch toward the rear of engine,
slightly angled to the upper right. This allows you to static time real
easily(dist slides right in with rotor pointing the right way, turn dist body
to line up mark and your good to go)
