Subject: Good heat for your bus

Last summer when I got my bus, I rebuilt the engine. While I was pulling
the heater boxes and heat exchangers off, I realized that they were in
pretty bad shape. I was able to patch the heater boxes, but my heat
exchangers (those tubes with the mushroom on top of them that connect the
heater boxes and the heater tubes under the bus) were beyond repair.  So
I went to my local VW store and bought ONE piece of that flexible heater
tube for the type one engines that goes from the fan shroud down through
the tin to the heater boxes and I bought TWO pieces of the flexible
paper-like tubes that go from the heater assist fan down to the heater
boxes in the type four engines.  The DRIVER'S side tube is longer, buy
two of those, NOT the passenger side tube.   So I took the type one
heater tube and cut four pieces about three to four inches long and put
each piece in an end of the type four tubes.  Get some duct tape and
connect your heater boxes to the heat tubes under the bus with these
tubes. Use the duct tape to keep them from coming out. You now have heat
exchangers that have NO HOLES at all.  You can't turn the heat off, but
if you live in a cold climate like I do, I don't see why you would want
to turn them off in the winter.
