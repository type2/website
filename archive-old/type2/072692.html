The cure was to remove the ground
&gt;block from under the #3 intake manifold runner and clean it and the three
&gt;wires that ran to it until they were shiny and bright.

I thought it was funny that three wires would just up and dissappear.  I
was wondering whether the connectors had rattled loose.  While your at it
check all the connector contacts in all the plug housings.  Mine have had
occasion to rattle loose and backwards lately  (Which makes it really
interesting to diagnose).

&gt;Thanks to Steve Blackham, Karl von Salzen, and Al brase for their good
&gt;advice!

The nice thing about the list is we can commiserate together.


&gt;First, the terminals on the ECU Plug are 5, 15, and 17. (Tho this is kind
&gt;of meaningless, there was no relation between pin # and position on my
&gt;plug, just be sure that there are three terminals with continuity to
&gt;ground, eh?)

No, the pins are in sequence, Starting from the furthest bottom (wire
harness side) it starts up the longest side  of the plug #1 (coil) thru 18
(not used unless you have a external throttle valve switch, '75 &amp; 76 I
think).  The other side starts at 19 (not used) through 36 (not used).  The
numbers  in between are pretty much as I gave you earlier depending on what
options you have and what vehicle your driving: BMW, Toyota, or VW Bus.

Look at the diagram:

LJET-27.GIF)

The grounds wires that lead to the block terminal are: #17; # 16 and #5.
#15 leads to the Aux Air Valve.

&gt;Second, the quality of the EGA tester is high, but the case is plastic,
&gt;not metal as I said (must be those flashbacks they promised me :)

When you get past your present problems I'd like more info on this EGA
tester.  I fashioned an O 2 sensor to figure out mixture and EFI problems
but would like to have a CO sniffer too.

nd lastly, the problems are not over :-(  It does run, but the fuel pump
&gt;now starts when the key is in the on position and continues to run until
&gt;the key is off.  *Something* is wrong in the double relay!

Maybe, but check your pump switch in your AFM also.  Is the cover off your
AFM box?  Check to see if the poteniometer arm is triggering the pump
switch correctly.  (Careful if you haven't removed the cover from the AFM
yet, Its fragile.)  I would surmise that something is afoul in the AFM flap
or contact arm which is not allowing the proper readings. Also check the
throttle valve for obstructions or stickiness.  And check to see if the
accelerator cable is adjusted correctly.

  Also, the idle
&gt;is not stable, but on a positive note, it is way down from the 2500 RPM
&gt;that it was doing before this occurred.
&gt;
&gt;The real problem, on my bus and also Roger's problem (earlier today with
&gt;his dual solex problem) is that not only must all the systems work, they
&gt;must all work *at the same time* :-)


Remember SH*T happens.  And on a VW Bus it's an adventure!


Have fun

PS:  From what I've read, it's a NO-NO to put a ohm meter directly on the
ECU contacts???
