Subject: Re:  Octane -- vs. RON

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   I followed the Octane subject matter not the Gas. If subjects aren't real
&gt; &gt; specific I don't always read them. If the subject line changes on the same
&gt; &gt; thread it makes it more difficult to follow. Octane grabbed my interest,
&gt; &gt; Gas did not. Which one is more specific? The one post I did read used RO
&gt; &gt; and MO. I wasn't sure if RO meant RON or what. 
&gt; &gt;   Sorry, but I do not have the time or patience to read every post that
&gt; &gt; comes my way.

Rick,
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention to the subject headings.  Don't
remember if it was under octane or gas. 

I just get frustrated saying the same thing over and over again, you
understand ;-)
