Subject: Vendors

Hi Folks:

I've dealt with booth the Bus Boys and Bus Depot and gotten what I 
needed.  Of course my vehicle is not a daily driver, but still I was 
happy with the service.

As had been said before, we are dealing with OLD vehicles here.  The 
rules for newer parts don't apply.  I'm grateful for vendors like 
these and for this list to help me with this ambitious restoration 
project on my Westy.

DrBen
