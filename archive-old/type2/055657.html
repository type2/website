Subject: TOOL questions and meximotors

A friend has a wooden box with ZELENDA US 297 written on it and it is complete with all the precision stuff inside. I think it is for setting up ring &amp; pinions on swing axles. I read in the list a while back about someone who is into this but I can't find it. Could some one please tell me if that is what it's for and if it is worth much. He also has a PEISELER VW 381-3 &amp; 384-1 . I've never worked at a dealership so they are Greek to me.I've looked in the old shop manuals and seen similar items, but not exactly. thank you. Now, about those motors with the cast cranks. I installed one in a customer's 74 bug last fall. The guy is kind of a friend so when I said they have NO WARRANTY I told him that if he tried it out for me, I would take care of it personally. So far, 13,000 miles and it's been OK. IT is one smooooth son of a gun and QUIET, too. I definately was leary at first, but I figured metallurgy and design principles could possibly have changed a tad bit in the last 35 or !
40 years. I suppose if the crank breaks I'll just stick an old fashioned forged crank in it and let her rip. I don't see the need for the big &amp; heavy 9mm valve adjusters, though. More weight on the wrong end of the rocker. Time will tell, I guess. Thanks again. Jim Duncan OUT
