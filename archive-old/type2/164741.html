Bob,

(I know you know already know this stuff, but if it helps)

Did you try a new coil and check your coil polarity? (you know 1 = negative
15 = +)

Also you didn't crank the engine over or move the position of the crank with
the dizzy out or loose did you? If so, your distributor drive gear may have
skipped to the next bracket. It will run, but like total crap.

Is your dizzy spring in place? Do you have the correct endplay on the dizzy
shaft? Are the fiber shims missing? If any of the above, the shaft will ride
up and down too high and make the points do a very bad version of the
Lambada.

Also, does your dizzy bolt down completely flush to the case? If not, it can
ride just on the top of the drive gear and only intermittently grab.

(I only suggest these things because I have had all of the above happen to
me on a Type 4 and Type 1 motor)

I wish I were there to help! At least you know the motor/heads are good with
the compression corrected! Chris is battling the same compression problems
with a mismatched Vanagon/'79/'78 motor and heads some nut-job put together.
