Yes, you can buy and install a dipstick sender.  There are a variety of
opinions on which is better, the dipstick or bottom plate mount, but take
it from someone who has split a T4 case, the location winds up &lt; 1&quot; apart.
The plate mount is a bit less of a bother when you check your oil, but may
leak.  It is basically a case of &quot;you pays yer money, you takes yer
chances&quot;.

On the temp sender, there is an alternative, but it is a bit more work.
You may buy a second CHT sender, and drill and tap for it (an M8x1.0 tap,
no mean trick to find), then install a guage.  The problem is that the CHT
sender and the under-sparkplug senders work differently.  Here is a short
description:

Under-cylinder sender...  most of these are thermocouples.  the idea of a
thermocouple is that when two different materials as in close contact, one
will almost always &quot;donate&quot; electrons to the other.  The reason is couched
deeply in physics (read: magic)  this flow of electrons creates a voltage.  
the higher the temperature of the thermocouple, the more electrons move,
and the higher the voltage.  This is the reason your battery works better
as the temp gets warmer.  By hooking a microvoltmeter to the thermocouple,
and reading the volts produced, the calibrating the microvoltmeter in
degrees, you can read off the temperature of the thermocouple (and your
head).  It would be easy to hook a properly calibrated voltmeter to your
battery and read off the battery compartment temp, BTW.

CHT sensor...  most of these are thermal resistance devices (thermistors).
The other side of &quot;when the temperature rises, more electrons move&quot; is
that there are substances where the resistance of the substance varies
with temperature. The hotter the stuff is, the easier the electrons move.  
If you shoot a voltage thru them at 30 degrees, then the resistance is
quite high, if you heat them to 100 degrees (or 500 degrees :-), then the
resistance is very low.  By measuring the change in resistance, using an
ohmmeter calibrated in degrees, you can tell how hot the sender is.

Confused? :-)  George is welcome to go into the gory details :-) (but is
forbidden to use more than two formlae :-)  The base problem is that with
the under-sparkplug sender, you get a properly calibrated guage.  With the
CHT, you have to build your own (and can't use the one from the
under-sparkplug kit)

&gt; Hey!
&gt; 
&gt; Can a dipstick oil temp sender be used on a type 4 engine?
&gt; 
&gt; Is there an alternative to placing the cylinder head temp sender under the 
&gt; spark plug ? (type 4 engine)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any replies.
