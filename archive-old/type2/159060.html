&gt; If my posting is against the rules, I apologize profusely, and hope it can

&gt; &quot;hey, check this out!&quot; is not innapropriate. I am curious as to what makes
&gt; the difference between ebay, and say Samba, where notifications of items for
&gt; sale crop up regularly without a breach of rules notification. 

One difference between most samba ads and ebay is a stated price verses 
a price which on ebay is increased by bidding. I cannot say if that 
really makes a difference but it something to consider. Stepping back 
linking to an ad on thesamba is a direct reference to a VW community, 
where ebay is more of an auction house without the sole purpose of 
supporting our community. It's something that comes up now and again, 
and as the list traffic is much slower than it used to be it's less of 
an issue, but the last vote which came up IIRC around 1.5 years ago 
decided to keep the auction statment in the charter.

&gt; I also cannot
&gt; find the charter online to research. Can anyone send a link to it?

here is the link for those interested:
