Subject: VW TV Series Sighting

OK, OK, admittedly its a Type III not a Type II, but I'll take what I 
can get.  On TV last night started a 4 show series on our Public 
Broadcast System, a new 'Mystery!' series, Oliver's Travels.  It 
concerns a professor of comparitive religions, who is also into 
anagrams, who is made 'redundant' and hits the road.  He hits the road 
in an early 70's Squareback (very good shape, though I think I 
detect a muffler leak).  Oliver is a very quirky, sometimes silly, 
definitely different character.  Hmm, does this have anything to do 
with him driving a VW, or is it the other way around?  This British
series was just brought to the US.  Have you UKer's seen it already?
The opening scene had a Vanagon, I think, in the background.
Lots of scenes of the Squareback in various settings.  Fun show, even 
if it didn't have a VW in it.  My wife couldn't believe I spotted it 
in the brief intial trailer for it.  The hostess, Diana Rigg, 
introduces the show from a set that includes a stylized drawing of
the Squareback also.

Did any of you UKer listee's have anything to do with getting a VW 
as a 'character' in this series?
