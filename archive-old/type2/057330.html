Subject: Re: 1.8 smooth running

One thing you might want to check is the key in the fan hub. I just
burnt up a good running engine because the fan hub key sheared somehow,
and so the timing marks were waaaaaaaayyy off. My fault, because I knew
damn well it didn't sound right when it was starting (sounded too far
advanced) and because it seemed to be running too hot, but I was busy
with other stuff, and naturally lazy anyway. And everytime I actually
checked the timing it sure looked *right*, that is, the timing marks
lined up like they should, so I left it alone. Ruined both heads, and
only about 10,000 miles on a nice rebuild.
