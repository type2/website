Sorry. That is the best image we have of that console right now. We don't
have one in stock to take pictures of. Those are usually only ordered by us
when a customer actually places an order for one.

We have sold quite a few of those consoles without any customer complaints
about them.

Thank You,

Subject: [T2] BusBoys Center Console


&gt; Folks,
&gt;
&gt; Per my request, BusBoys recently sent me a .jpg of the center console they
&gt; sell for baywindows... it's a b&amp;w line drawing, so I'm not keen on
&gt; forking-over $100 for something that may or may not suit my tastes.
Anyone
&gt; have one of these?  Comments?
