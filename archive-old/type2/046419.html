&gt;	Hello Everybody.....I just recieved a sale catalog from Harbor
&gt;Fright tools. They have an engine stand for under $40.00. Is there any
&gt;reason why this would not work for my 1600dp engine? I have seen the VW
&gt;specific one that bus depot and others sell for $70.00 and up. Just trying
&gt;to save some cash .

Well problem is the $40 stand won't have any easy way to attach
to a VW case, BUT...

I recently bought one of the cheapo (actually reduced to $33 at
AutoZone) 750 lb Chinese engine stands.  Intended to just take it
back if I didn't like it, but frankly it actually ends up quite nice.  Very
heavy manufacture, nice quality welds, good design, but...

The stupid hardware was just bizzare, 8mm bolts to attach the casters
had heads around 13.5mm, no metric or american size worked.  I just
replaced with good stuff and am quite happy.  Now to attach it to a
VW case is a bit of a chore to do right.  You can get a cheeseball
adapter, or take the better route.  The stand is itself heavy duty enough
to easily hang a Chevy V6 or the like on, sufficient for even a T4 with
all hardware, let alone a little T1.  I took an old 091 bellhousing (used
the 091 cause I had it but an 002 would work fine as long as you are
only using smaller clutches) sawzalled half of the bellhousing away
down about 3 inches (to an appropriately placed reinforcing rib) then
was able to bolt the bellhousing using 4 existing bolt locations right to
the real heavy duty engine stand mounting plate with only some minor
filing of the grooves in two spots on the mounting plate to accomadate
the VW bellhousing bolt pattern, didn't even have to get out a drill.

I have ended up with something easily to rival most &quot;professional&quot; VW
engine stands, much heavier than anything under $200 on the market.
This stand did look a bit better designed than the Harbor Freight version
and was $50, but AutoZone was selling them out and had reduced them
a few times.  I've hung an aircooled Vanagon block with all FI, mounting
bar, tin, acessories, exhaust on it, and it is quite capable.  Total cost was
$35 for the stand with tax, and if I had to buy it a bellhousing from Weddle
would cost about $20.  One sawzall blade and about 8 bolts.  Cutting
away half the bellhousing allows me to mount just the first case half
drop in the crank, etc., then place the other half on.  When the second
half is mounted I attach it with some short spacers made out of iron pipe
that space the case to the surface of the cut away bellhousing.  On a T4
I can even torque the flywheel bolts, but wouldn't try it on a T1 (well
maybe.)  Much better than the crappy tubular thing RMMW and others
sell, and better than what I had before.  Oh and I cut away the drivers side
so I can use it as a test stand as well, as previously I had been using
the bellhousing for that purpose.

All that said if I was doing just one T1 I'd simply get one of the $20 bench
mount stands.  Cheap and a lot better than cursing the engine laying on
a box or something.
