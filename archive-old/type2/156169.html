Subject: Fold down seat strap

I got another order from Bus Depot this week and they said that the Loop Straps (221-885-461) that pull the fold down seat latches are NLA.  Rats, just my luck.  Does anyone know where I can get some?

My newly replated turn signal base assemblies are back and I have reassembled them.  They look better than new.  There should be no problem seeing them now.

Current project: 1972 Bus.
Next project: 1982 Vanagon.
