Subject: Re: Pushrod tubes

&gt;Just found some tube weirdness. In a box of assorted stuff I got with
&gt;my '81, there were 8 shiny new pushrod tubes. Thought I might as well
&gt;use them -- two went in fine, the other 6 won't go noway even with the
&gt;rubber off. The big end is too big. These even have the paper still on
&gt;them, one of the things it says is &quot;Dealer $5.49, RBI $3.49&quot;. Never
&gt;heard of RBI. There's also a little tag on a couple that says &quot;Made in
&gt;Taiwan&quot;. Pretty crummy quality control, which is weird because I buy
&gt;lots of computer stuff made in Taiwan and it's usually pretty 
top-notch.

I too have run into this problem in the past.  On the '78 I once had I 
bought 8 pushrod tubes from the local VW FLAPS.  3 fit and the other 5 
were like Harmon's, the big end was too big to fit into the bore in the 
cylinder head.  I believe they were also Taiwanese.  Apparently someone 
out there is making these to the wrong specifications.  

The next time I ordered pushrod tubes, I ordered them from Ron at Bus 
Depot.  I don't know what his source is, but all of them fit perfectly.

So everyone beware of the Taiwanese pushrod tubes :-)
