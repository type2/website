Subject: Oil Leak

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have an oil leaking from the front (FIF) seal.  In the past it has =
been moderate (2&quot; to 2.5&quot;) spot on the ground.  Lately the volume of oil =
leaking seems to have increased (4.5&quot; to 6.5&quot;) spot on the ground every =
time I stop.  I know it will need to be fixed eventually.  I am worried =
about the increase in leakage, do I have a big problem yet?  Any help =
would be great.
