Subject: Re: [T2] f**ked up I think

78 2liter with pertronix.

have MSD coil on stock dist with pertronix points eliminator

been getting a weak spark.   frustrated I pulled the 8ohm resistor out of
the circuit raising the volts to the coil from 10 to 12

engine started and ran nice for about 10 minutes then just stopped... no
start after that, no spark from the coil, coil is cold not even warm...

getting nothing from the coil, no spark at all.......

what have a broken????   how do you fry a magnet??

I'm getting so frustrated with this ignition system....

thanks
Bob
