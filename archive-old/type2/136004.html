Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Color question (Vorange on Vanagon)

&gt; My 80 V-gon is a color of orange that I9ve never
&gt; seen on another bus or
&gt; wedge (it is original).  It is quite different from
&gt; brilliant orange9 as I
&gt; found out.  The paint name is Ruesch orange9, not
&gt; sure about spelling, but
&gt; ruesch is just german for orange (looked it up).

Strange 'orange' is also German for 'orange' :-)
But what I am wondering about is: when you know the
name of the colour then were did you read the name? If
the paint sticker is still there then the code should
also be on it.

For the Vanagon the M-plate and the paint sticker are
located under the drivers seat. On the beam holding
the the right seat-rail.

I have a 1979 and a 1985 fiche with Vanagon
information, it only speaks of Brilliant orange. But
this might be because the fiches are for the German
market. If this colour is a special paint colour for
the USA market then it might not be on there (same
with Dattelbraun and Fuchsrot for the USA-Champagne
Edition bus...also not mentioned on German fiches,
only on US-fiches)

By the way, I can't find 'ruesch' or 'r|sch' in my
dictionary ('ue' is a way to write '|' in german if
you do not have the ability to write '|' on a
keyboard)



yours,


Vincent
