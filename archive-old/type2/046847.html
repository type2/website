Subject: [T2] Full flow gurus needed

I am this close to installing my rebuilt 1600 dp.  It's taken a little
longer then expected but I wasn't in a hurry.

I have a few questions with regard to the full flow NPT fitting that 
returns the oil to the main galley.  I bought two brass fittings...
one 90degree and one 45degree.  I'd like to use the 90 but it won't
twist in.  As it turns the fitting hits the case.  Can't even go one
full turn.  The case was clearanced as much as possible.

The 45 goes in but in order to get the hose fittings angled correctly
another 45degree fitting will be required (bringing the total angle to
90 and parallel with the muffler).  The problem with this solution is
two fold.  1) it 'looks' messy.  2) a good size piece of the rear 
pulley tin would have to be cut out.

My questions are:  How have others fit this fitting?  Is there a type
of 90 degree fitting that I haven't seen?  (hydraulic hose shop showed
me all they had)

Any solutions sought.
