Subject: FS:  '79 Type 2 Camper  Phila. area

Hello

Bought a nice 79 Westfalia camper but need another family vehicle for young drivers. I am in Wilmington Delaware, 25 minutes from downtown Phila. 1.5 hrs from Baltimore, easy access from I95. This one very good shape, only 35K since complete engine overhaul by local shop with genuine VW parts. New exhaust system and cat. conv 10K miles ago. New brake pads &amp; cable, new clutch &amp; cable, new wheel bearings, new cv joint boots, new canvas on poptop, new battery last week. 185K total miles, 4 speed.  Service records show over $6000 invested last 2 years, taking offers around $4000. Oh yeah, it's the light yellow-green, very little rust, good tires, very clean interior.  Call Dale at 302-529-0345 or email me for more info.  Would also consider trade for another camper with auto transmission.

Thanks!
