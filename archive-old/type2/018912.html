Subject: Voltage regulator replacement, etc.
Message-ID: &lt;37FEE4A0.7CE6_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

I just replaced my voltage regulator. How/when do I know if I screwed
anything up? According to my multimeter, the voltage at the main battery
is about 13.25 and the auxiliary battery is about 11.75 (it was not so
hot to begin with).

I have a nice new breather box hose where there was none before, and a
lovely little cork sticking up out of my air cleaner now. I feel like a
*real* vee-dubber! :-)

I didn't even try to adjust the idle. I just got all confused and didn't
want to wreak any havoc. I turned that big brass screw on the top of the
left carb, but couldn't hear any difference, so I put it back to where I
thought it was and left it.
