Subject: Re: [T2] Wiper doesn't wipe.

Hi Gary,

very good chance its the nut that hold the wiper arm onto the rotating spindle has worked loose. Just pop the plastic dome cover off and tighten with a 10mm spanner.

If it's not that then possibly the splines are striped from the end of the spindle or in the arm in which case the 'offending' part needs to be replaced.

Good luck

&gt; On the way home from work today I noticed that the passenger side windshield
&gt; wiper was only moving up and down about three inches.  Any tips on what may
&gt; be the cause/fix for this.
