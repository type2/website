Yep.

&gt; 2. Sway-a-way used to be good, but I haven't seen a set of them mounted.
&gt; Again, I want tight and close to the body. Anyone have any pics ?

Becoming obsolete with every passing day. Check my website if you want to

&gt; 3. Any custom builders ?

If I had not already found the sway-a-way I would have bought the Whiteline
from Aircooled_dot_net also.
