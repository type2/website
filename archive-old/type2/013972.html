&gt; Den et al.,

&gt; I'll check the rotors against a 10mm wrench this afternoon.  And, I am sad
&gt; to report that the pistons DID NOT go back into the caliper easily to make
&gt; room for the pads.  In fact, I had to use a screwdriver laid across the
&gt; piston with as-even-as I could get pressure to force them back in...

I don't see this as being unusual.  The piston likes to be pushed in
evenly.  If you push one edge it tends to jam.  Sometimes mine will push
in with considerable finger pressure, sometimes it takes a bit more.

&gt; if my
&gt; caliper is hosed, can it be rebuilt?  By whom?  How much?  I'm not keen on
&gt; the idea of buying new calipers _at_ $90-ish a pop.

They are easily rebuilt if the seals are bad.  Cost is about $10 for the
piston seal (a rubber ring) and dust seal.  I found the piston a piece of
cake to remove and replace, but the dust seal was a bear to get seated
properly in the caliper.  Never unbolt the two halves of the caliper from
each other!  If you do, there are more seals to replace.

However, if the caliper is corroded inside, it is junk.  If the calipers
were really rare, one could have them resleeved for $$$, but for
baywindows the calipers are still available.  If you think that $90 is
bad, price the same item for a contemporary car!

&gt;
&gt; And T.P.: I suspect you are absolutely right when you mentioned recently
&gt; that removal of the hub makes installing brake shoes and cylinders easier...
&gt; while I accomplished it with just the drum removed, it certainly would have
&gt; been nice to have the extra room to play with.
&gt;
&gt; Additionally, I did not lubricate (gasp) nor did I do the 25mph
&gt; go-and-brakes.  With all that bloody noise coming from the wheel, I wasn't
&gt; about to start jamming things up!

Lubrication isn't absolutely needed.  I don't do it and get a few
squeaks as the pads wear in.  I'm allergic to turning the rotors, so my
wear-ins take longer as the pad conforms with the not-quite-flat rotor.

One thing that wasn't mentioned was the anti-rotation plate for the
piston.  This is a thin sheet metal plate that goes between the pad and
the piston with two tabs that keep the piston in the proper position.  The
piston has a cutaway section that ensures that one side of the pad touches
before the other, which is also a squeak-reduction measure, IIRC.  If the
plate is missing, or its tabs are squished flat, the wrong end of the pad
might be touching first.
