Subject: Coil over shocks

 &gt;For those of you who currently have air shocks or coil overs on your
 &gt;bus, where in the H*LL did you find the longer bolts with the right
 &gt;thread for the upper mounting? It is driving me nuts trying to find the
 &gt;stupid thing!! Please help.

I've been looking for coil over shocks for the rear of my '71 for a long 
time. Does anyone know where I can find them?
