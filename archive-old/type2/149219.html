Subject: 2 weeks until the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout

Hi Volks

Just a reminder that there are now but two weeks left until the True  
Canadian Winter Bus Campout.

It's been a very strange winter here in Toronto; with more days above  
freezing than not.  At lunch on Thursday I got some takeout and  
picnicked at the shore of Lake Ontario. it wasn't exactly warm out,  
but at 8C it wasn't cold either. At least not for Early February.  
Looking out the window we have no snow anywhere.

Here's the long-range forecast:

So there is still a good chance for snow on the ground at TCWBC3.  
Even without it, the show will go on. Arrive any time after 1PM, and  
head to the electric campsites. (there are about 10 sites available,  
and we usually double-up.) Plug in and set up. When I get there we'll  
get the campfire going and I'll get set up for dinner. Turkey dinner,  
that is. Deep fried; so the skin will be crisp and golden.

After dinner we'll relax around the campfire. Bring an instrument if  
you have one. In the morning we'll have Breakfast Burritos --please  
bring an ingredient.

If you're planning on attending, please let me know ASAP. Thanks!


Happy trails,
