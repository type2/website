Subject: Re: Valve Adjustment questions

Re valve adjustments- you are sure you have NO hydraulic lifters, yes?
They would have no free play in them, since you adjust 2 turns in AFTER
contact is made with valve end!  A simple way to check is to wait overnite,
comeout, and feel whether there is piston play or &quot;Squishy springiness&quot; in
any or all rockers when cyl is at TDC and you pull the rocker by adjustor
HARD against the pushrod.  A nonhydraulic engine you couldn't do this.  The
pushrod tubes are said to be different in hydraulic engines......

  When adjusting, note that the adjustment nuts are skinnier for a reason
-1) to make using a screwdriver easier (2) less mass to fling up and down a
zillion times an hour (3) possibly to allow better clearance to valve
cover?   You could remove the screw/nut and stick nut in a vise as you
apply WD40 and screw it in and out.  It should be moveable but doesn't have
to be 2-finger removable!   On the car, it's best to use a six sided offset
box wrench to loosen the adjustors, or a socket to just get them loose,
then the box---you have to learn to use both the screwdriver and the box
wrench together to prevent the adjustor turning as you move the locknut.
Assuming non-hydraulic lifters, you have to loosen the adjustment until you
can slip a feeler gauge in there (.006).   If not adjusted for 10k or more,
the valves indeed could have been tight and headed for burn city...I'd do a
compression check after the proper adjustment!
   Re TDC for #1 and distributor mark- usually the rotor should point to
about 4 O'clock as you stare down on open distributor.   Someone may have
rotated the distributor 90 degrees in either direction  relative to the
center shaft so the mark is not in line with #1.  Would still work, except
condensor wire may be snaked around to reach coil?
