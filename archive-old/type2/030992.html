&gt; After tearing down the old engine, it became clear that the best course of

same here with my GEX disaster.

&gt; I put the question to the mechanic &quot;How could we do this rebuild better and
&gt; make it last longer if I were willing to spend a little more money?&quot;  He
&gt; thought about this just a minute before answering that if I had an extra
&gt; $200 to spend that doing a precision engine balancing is what he would do
&gt; if it were his own engine.

again exactly what my machinist said.

&gt; For those who do not know what is involved: brand new pistons and
&gt; connecting rods come from the factory with plus-or-minus 10 grams, and
&gt; sometimes up to 20 grams difference in weight.  The precision engine
&gt; balance involves weighing these parts then filing at them until they are
&gt; all exactly the same weight.  Next, the crankshaft and flywheel are spun on

well the difference between a 1gram balance and a 0 gram balance was quite
a few hundreds of dollars, sa went with the 1gram balance, at 4,000 RPM
that is more than adequate

&gt; VW Type IV 1800 engine could idle so smoothly.  None of my previous engines
&gt; come close.

about the same results with a 2liter engine, very very smooth running
