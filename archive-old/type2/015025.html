&gt;&gt;On the floor of my '73 bus there is an oval hole. Attached to this hole is
&gt;&gt;heater tubing that goes toward the front of the bus. Over this hole there is
&gt;&gt;a black flap which is hinged at one end and held down with a rather weak
&gt;&gt;spring.

Just don't let any blue jays in the bus.  (see Mark Twain's &quot;Bakers Blue
