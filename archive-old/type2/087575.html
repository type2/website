Subject: Re: [T2] svda dizzy

Rob,

Two things.

First, Tell James I need that 205T tomorrow and to check his e-mail 
for my contact info.

Second. If that dizzy advances to a total 45 degrees the motor will 
be toast before he makes it halfway to Greensboro tomorrow. A type 4 
dizzy will advance that much but and should but not a type 1. Do you 
have a timing light that show how much advance you are getting? Make 
sure it only gets as far as 30 btdc. Otherwise Set it at 0 with the 
vac connected. Rev it and see how high it goes. If TDC is 12 o'clock 
on the pulley than 30 degress is 11 o'clock is should not go past 
11:00.

&gt;My buddy has a question I am posting for him:
&gt;
&gt;I have a 71 westy with a new brazilian DP 1600.  I have chosen to run a 34
&gt;pict carb, and after months of distributor frustration, I ordered an SVDA
&gt;distributor from aircooled_dot_net.  Now I have to figure out how to set it up.
&gt;John says i should set the timing to 32 degrees max advance with the vacuum
&gt;line off.  He goes on to say that the timing will be about 45 degrees max
&gt;advance once the vacuum line is hooked back up.  This seems too hot to me.
&gt;Does anyone have experience with this unit?  I really don't want to burn up
&gt;the engine.   Any help would be greatly appreciated.
