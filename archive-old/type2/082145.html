Well, I finally made it home...I drove my FIRST 1970 westy home from flordia 
this week. She made it 1000 miles. Although I did have a few problems. First 
of all about 200 miles into the trip, she started spiting and sputering..So I 
stop and the fuel filet was full of a red liquid. Pulled into a part store 
and bought a new one. Then when I stopped at a gas station about 700 miles 
back I jumped back in to crank her and she wouldnt crank. Nothing will happen 
when i turn the key, wont even turn over, so I charges the battry up, and 
pushed her off. Other than that she works good. So if anyone could lend a 
hand on might be happening why it wont start. When I push it off it starts 
fine. Also I had to replace the fuel filter like every 300 miles. Could this 
be gunk in the tank......

Thanks.....
Rustin Shelton (1970 Westy)
