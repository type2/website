Subject: Headlight relay (and short trip report)

Volks:

I got no hi beams.  Pull the handle....nada.  SO I pull out the switch
and the multimeter.  Switch seem to make contact.  So I figure dead
relay and order one.  Install it. Still no hi beams. I can't figure out
how this things supposed to work.  I checked the voltage on the wires
going into the relay using the black as ground.  I get voltage from the
signal and on the yellow wire but not on the white.  No click either.

TRIP REPORT
Had me first bus campout Sunday night on a beautiful spot on a river.  I
had forgoten how much easier this bus campin' thing is! (Its been almost
10 years) Great trip. Also reminded me of how much work I have to do on
my bus.  I mean, I gotta do this more often!
