&gt; &gt;I have a 1971 Riviera conversion pop-top camper. The canvas
&gt; needs work. It's not actually canvas, but some sort of yellow plastic
thing.

&gt; Id say just replace the whole thing, I got one for my 79 from
&gt; busdepot_dot_com.


Unfortunately, our supplier of Riviera canvas went under. We only have
Westfalia canvas now. I am not aware of anyone who still has Riviera canvas.
