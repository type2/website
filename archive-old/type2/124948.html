Subject: RE: [T2] My bus blows all over the road..............

&gt; When i get going 65 and up.. the slightest gusts of wind  
&gt; really move me around.  New tires, too.


I assume you're using sidewall reinforced or load range C or D tires.
(This is a must.)  Other than that, stiffer shocks or an aftermarket
swaybar would be your next move.
