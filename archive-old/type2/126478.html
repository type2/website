Subject: Re: [T2] front door rubber

Mine's still setting in the plastic bag waiting for my install, so I
haven't had that particular pleasure yet, but...

I did the rear hatch seal a couple weeks ago. If the seal twisted at
the corners, it would be hard to get the hatch closed and sealed. Took
a couple trys of lining it up just right before it closed smoothly.
Check for any spots that look like they're being pinched, particularly
towards the front edge.

Keep in mind also that the DPO could have adjusted the door to close
tighter with the worn out seal. ;-)
