Subject: re:Looking for-----(MOFOCO?)

Terry asked:
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone ever heard of a rebuilder / parts 
&gt;distributor, by the name of
&gt;Mofco, in the Milwaukee area?

&gt;I was told about them yesterday, but no phone
&gt;nunmber, address, web-site.

Probably MOFOCO, and you will find them discussed in
the archives of the list.
My recommendation is to avoid them like the plague,
even if they were across the street.  I still start
feeling my blood pressure rise when I think of them,
and it's been a couple of years  since I had bad
dealings with them--no apologies from them when I had
them on the phone, etc.  Long period of lying to me
about an order, never would admit they didn't have
some of the parts and hadn't sent the rest yet,,,,,,,

oops, I'm starting to feel incoherent on the subject. 
Look in the archives, as I think my story and others
are there.
