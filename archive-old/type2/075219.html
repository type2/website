Subject: Oil splatter on back windshield!

I have had a problem with oil splatter all over the backside of my 74 Westy
(type 4 engine, 1.8L) ever since I bought it.  A local mechanic told me that
I lost my seal on my dipstick and it was leaking out that hole and the fan
was spraying it everywhere.  Well, I found a tiny o-ring that fit the
diameter of the dipstick and that didn't solve the problem.  Another
mechanic's response was, &quot;VeeDub's don't leak oil... they just leave their
mark.&quot; Cute response, but not very helpful.

I have noticed oil collecting at the motor mount screw heads, once I park
it... Should I buy a oil seal kit and get to work?  Or is there a simpler
solution?

Did I say backside?
