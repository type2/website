Subject: Platinum Cat Q's
Message-ID: &lt;f4c8c006.2446a510_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I've decided to install a vented catalytic space heater in my 82 Westy. I 
will go with the Platinum Cat from thermal Systems, Inc.

I would like any input on listmembers who have installed one of these in 
their own vans/busses. My main question is: what size did you put in? 

The large size (6000 btu) would seem to require the construction of a &quot;box&quot; 
to put it in behind the passenger seat. This would seriously inhibit the 
swiveling of the seat to the rearward position.

The smaller size (3000 btu) would fit perfectly behind the passenger seat 
down near the floor. This would allow the seat to swivel and not be in the 
way. Would this put out enough heat to make it comfortable on cold mountain 
nights?

Thanks for any input you may have.
