&gt; Hey All --
&gt; I have an electrical question for anyone who can help -- and please
excuse
&gt; this question (if applicable) as I am fairly unexperienced when it
comes to
&gt; volts, watts and electrical systems for busses and homes, and would
rather
&gt; ask one or more experts out there rather than just go ahead and
&quot;touch the
&gt; damn wires together and see what happens.&quot;  Anyway, here goes:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 79 Riviera camper with an auxiliary battery/isolator setup.
 I've
&gt; been preparing for a trip to Baja for some time and want to find a
way to
&gt; hook up some little clip-on dashboard fans to the aux battery for
cooler
&gt; driving.  (Would also like to rig up little things like reading
lights and
&gt; such too.)  Well, I've been neglecting to notice that this camper is
&gt; actually equipped with a couple of standard-looking double wall
sockets
&gt; (tho different from the infamous &quot;silver socket&quot;).  My first thought
was
&gt; &quot;Cool, I'll just plug the fans into the sockets&quot; and away we go. 
Now, I'm
&gt; thinking the socket (12V, I assume) and fan (label says 120V - 60Hz)
 are
&gt; made for entirely different electrical systems.  Can an appliance of
this
&gt; voltage be simply plugged into a socket for a 12V battery (and will
I cook
&gt; my electrical system and/or me), or is some type of
adaptation/converter
&gt; needed?

If the sockets look like the outlets in your house, then they are
likely to be for 110V , probably wired to the power inlet on the side
of the bus.  Unfortunately these do not work unless you are hooked up
to &quot;shore power&quot;

High-end folks use power inverters to convert 12V DC to 110V AC. 
Inverters aren't too efficient (they typically use 10% of their
maximum power rating even when idle) and they tend to hum annoyingly. 
They are nice for motorized things (such as blenders!) that are used
intermittently.

You'd probably be better off to just get fans, lights, etc. that run
on 12V. RV folks use lots of that stuff.
