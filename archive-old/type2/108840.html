Subject: Re: [T2] Hole saw sizes?

2 1/16 is a common VDO gauge dimension.
A common 2&quot; hole saw will cut a hole 2 1/16&quot;
due to the drill travel in thin sheet metal.
Practice on scrap metal and check the fit.
A  2 1/16&quot; hole saw is not a common size.
The cheaper hole saw made for wood will
cut several holes before it is destroyed if
the drill speed is kept slow and you use
some lubricating fluid.
I can cut a dozen holes with a disposable
$ 2 hole saw before I have to toss it.
Otherwise, buy the proper bimetal or
high speed steel hole saw, $15-20.

Subject: [T2] Hole saw sizes?


&gt; I am putting the city water hook up on my 76 Westy from PEP/Go Westy and
have
&gt; not yet got the part and was wondering if any of the list members knew the
&gt; diameter of the hole that it mounts in? Also I know it's been said
recently but
&gt; I need conformation on the diameter of the hole saw for the VDO guages I
think
&gt; it was 2 1/16?
