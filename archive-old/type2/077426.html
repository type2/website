Wic,

Congratulations.  I feel your elation (elatedness?).  You wanna go camping?

I did not have any problems with a stock bug muffler on my '71 Westy.  My 
pipes cleared everything upon installation.  You might try David Raistrick's 
suggestion of bending the pipes downward until they don't bang on the bumper.

I started with the peashooters, but didn't like the &quot;fweem&quot; sound.  

I found the &quot;Zoom Tube&quot; in a scrap heap at the place where I had the engine 
rebuilt and bought all the new stuff for the installation (Larry's Hot VW in 
Harriman).

I had to buy some bits and pieces at the FLAPS (Pep Boys) to make the Zoom 
Tube fit because of the trailer hitch, and it worked just fine, but it stuck 
out past the bumper and was easy to burn one's self on.

I went back to Larry's and bought some straight pipes (for that &quot;deep, 
throaty sound&quot;) and I'm satisfied with those.

I'm not too terribly concerned with the &quot;exhaust in the dead air space&quot; issue 
that other list members have alluded to.  No problems with odor, other than 
that characteristic smell that is unique to Lurch.  Maybe I'll buy a CO 
monitor/alarm.  I DO have a new seal on the rear hatch, however.

You wanna try the zoom tube out?
