Subject: Stuck Rear Brake Adjuster
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey Folks,
   &lt;Sigh&gt; Is nothing easy? I've encountered this on every VW I've ever owned, 
but always managed to break them free. Heeding the advice I got over the 
weekend to adjust my rear brakes, I did the right rear and all went well. 
Left side, no go. The star adjusters appear to have become one with the piece 
they fit into. I have tried: Liquid Wrench, heat, and vice grips-they still 
won't budge. It also appears to have been this way for some time, as the 
shoes on this side show almost no wear, as they are turned almost all the way 
in. Any suggestions on how to get these $#_at_&amp;!  things unstuck? TIA,      Jeff 
S.
