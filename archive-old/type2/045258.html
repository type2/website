&gt; I have an easy question. I'm replacing axle boots on my 1977 bus, the small

&gt; don't have any extras to practice with.

You crimp them with a pair of crimping pliers.  They look like a pincer,
with the crimping edge at right angles to the handle.

Or, if you're like me, you just use a narrow hose clamp to do the same
job.  Just tighten it a bit, not till the rubber is extruding through the
holes.

Others just leave the small clamp off altogether.  the rubber seems to be
fine at sealing, and some claim that this extends boot life.

Make your pick, and take your chances!
