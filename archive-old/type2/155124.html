&gt;What I got from Bus Depot looks like the '2nd Best' seal in your  pictures.  Doesn't look anything like the original.

I had to create that webpage because these repro engine lid seals aren't as good as the other seals that are available. Although I wrote that webpage several years ago but I don't think the situation has changed.

&gt;And your  pics make it look like the seal is glued to the body rather than the  door.  Is that correct?

Correct.
