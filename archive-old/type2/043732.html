I stand corrected, I work at a Porsche dealer and most aircooled cars that 
we/I see there have an aluminum case. I personally work more on VWs 
and 356s than early 911s. Somewhere my mind mixed up (more than) 
a few things, and I truly hate it when that happens ;-) Thanks for the 
interesting data!
