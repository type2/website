How To Convert/Restore
Old Cars, Station Wagons,
Vans, Trucks &amp; Buses into RVs

four stars 

Here's the Monty Python book of the year! Yes: &quot;And now for something
completely different!&quot; This little gem with a title longer than some
interstates is a most unusual and fascinating edition.

This isn't a customize-your-van book, but rather a historical look at the
earliest evolution of RVs. It's not about converting vehicles of the
Seventies and Eighties into campers but on the restoration, building, or
conversion of cars, trucks, and buses from just after World War I to
the Fifties. Here you'll find detailed drawings of pre-World War II bus
conversions; photos of Ford's &quot;Pushbutton Camper of the Future&quot;;
and ads such as that for a Carolina Body in Egyptian finish designed to fit
a Big Six Studebaker chassis. You'll see equipment and
conversions typical of the Twenties and Thirties and learn how to add
camping cabs to your favorite antique pickup.

Memorable chapters include those on homebuilts--including a 1917 Winton
motor home--and a chapter entitled 20th Century Prairie
Schooners. Pictured are examples of RV industry pioneer Pierce Arrow's
Travelodge, as well as the Buck Rogers designs: Brook Stevens's
Land Yacht and Count Alexis deSakhnoffsky's Jungle Yachts.

The photos are clear, but on the small side, and many have never been
presented in book form. There is enough information to motivate any
handy enthusiast to build his own version--and what a crowd pleaser it would
be at any old-car gathering.

The detailed, well researched text won't have you folding your tent up
early. Written by &quot;Gunner&quot; Gunnell, a respected author and editor of
numerous fine books including 75 Years of Pontiac-Oakland and Standard
Catalog of American Light Trucks, this book might be quickly
dismissed by most enthusiasts. Yet I have found it one of the most
fascinating on my shelves. Then again, I am a Monty Python fan!

John &quot;Gunner&quot; Gunnell (TAB Books , 1981), 5 x 8-1/4 in. paperback, 192 pp.,
220 illus., $5.00 (not listed in Warth Guide)
