Subject: Re: [T2] this little mouse, in my van

Lots of compressed air will move the droppings out.
Peanut butter and crackers will lure the mice out, just put the food on a
box about two feet from your sliding door (with the door open) they'll
leave.
Unless you're really pissed and then you need mouse traps.

&gt; When I turn on the van heat, up come mouse droppings. At best, they 
&gt; make
&gt; my system sound like a &quot;bingo machine&quot;.
