Subject: bus painting (hippy style) question

As a newer member of VB and T2 many of you are not aware of my occupation.  
I handle educational services for a group of mentally ill young women in a 
residential setting.  For some reason these girls really buy into the bus 
thing.  While they make fun of it, they are constantly bringing me VeeDub 
stuff and worry when one of my buses is not running.

On one occasion, when I killed the engine in my 1969, they students began 
drawing and decorating buses to make me feel better.  In order to give them 
a greater sense of ownership, I am doing a painting project with the girls.  
I will make a scrap book of all the buses they have drawn me.  They will 
then be allowed to put their hand print, in paint, on one of my buses which 
is already challenged in the paint department.

If you have any tips or suggestion in regards to this project please let me 
know.  I'm interested in what type of paint to use and any instructions for 
'best' results.   I realize many may think is type of project is 
sacrilegious, but it is worth the good feelings for my kids.

Thanks in advance.  My girls are really, really excited about this project.

hell of a good time.  Sometimes this makes planning the day a little
difficult.
