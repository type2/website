Subject: Re: [T2] Do-well:

[...]
I have put pertronix or the competitor into every vehicle i have had 
(that didnt have a halls) for years.  Only had one fail and it was only 
a few minutes to put a set of points in , crude set them, and drive 
home.  Before the electronic I lost a lot more than one set of 
points/condensor.  not to mention that on some vehicles trying to get 
dwell right is a real PAIN.  Also it has been a long time since i have 
seen points that cheap.  With current prices on points and condenser for 
my vanagon(non cal) I was looking at ten bucks a year.

&gt; Pertronix (and I have no affilitation) from my experience just keep 
&gt; working. Lets see, I have had a pertronix since 1988. Its now 2002. If 
&gt; I had to mess with my points (which always seem to go out of adjustment 
&gt; about every 6 months) and need replacements every year.... I have saved:
&gt; $2.50 * 14 = $35.00 plus 28 hours of time. Hmm I think I'll sleep in 
&gt; tomorrow looks like I earned it. Besides I eliminate the need for a 
&gt; condensor, I havent even factored that in.
&gt; The buses response has always been better then with points as well. 
&gt; Cold starts are better, and the rpm curve is smoother. Dont even get me 
&gt; started talking about lack of point float. And yes even within an rpm 
&gt; range of 4000 you cant beat electronic vs mechanical.
&gt; Besides, all I have to do is carry a set of points and condensor(jeez 
&gt; they take up so much space!), in case it fails. The swap takes about 15 
&gt; minutes and then you are back to points.
