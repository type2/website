Subject: Re: [T2] The 248K mi engine run with TUFOIL  disassembled
  report

I used to run T-Plus PTFE oil treatment. I took a lot
of flack from others (typical PTFE arguments) but I
had a hill about two miles long to get to my home and
there were exact benchmarks such as downshift points
that I knew from daily driving. When I started running
the PTFE additive, I no longer needed to downshift and
my speed increased to above the legal limit. When that
engine was torn down, it had no signs of wear (just
breakage that was not attributable to the PTFE!) I
don't run it any more, but I still wonder about the
skeptics. -BaH

 Did TUFOIL help?  It
reduces friction (my 
 mpg went up by 3 on first use) and certainly did not
 hurt.  About $500 
 was spent on TUFOIL in 178K miles- worth it I'd say,
 as I avoided a 
 typical rebuild after my first 10 years of driving.
