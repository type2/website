Subject: Re: 8 volt battery in 6 volt bus

I would rather be flamed by the rest of the list than you have flames
coming out your bus. So I will say emphaticaly NO, NO, NO

Please do not jumpstart your 6 volter from a 12 volt car.

Your starter, dynamo, coil, radio, even the wiring loom will strongly
object.

Your best bet would be to have a spare battery and jump start from
that.
