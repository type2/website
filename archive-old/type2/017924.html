Saw this one in my neighborhood...too tall for my garage or I might go
for it.

Hightop conversion of uncertain origin (brass plate is rubbed shiny,
stamped with a few numbers).

Moderately new Baja Bug engine. It's pretty solid and very clean...the
only appreciable rust was under the driver's rubber (needs attention
soon.) Owner is asking $1200.

Call Paul at 805 647-1823 in Ventura, CA
