Subject: Northern VA/DC source for 9 X 1.25 Helicoils

Longshot, but does anyone maybe in my area (Arlington, VA) know a source
(not mail order) for helicoils? Tried Autozone and they only had them for
Sparkplug repair. I dropped an exhaust stud and need to replace it. I got
the new stud but the threads are a bit trashed. I have time this weekend
and want to fix it...
