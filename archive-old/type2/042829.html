Sorry to say it, but I'm moving back to California in a month (new job), I
can't afford to fix it, and I can't drive it back in the condition it's in. 
I hate to part with it, but I really don't have much choice at this point...
:(

(Hey!  Know anyone in the MN/WI/ND/SD/IA area who's looking to unload a
running Type4 engine for around $200?  :)

So, anyway, on to the details (and there are a lot of details):

The story:

I bought this bus in San Jose, CA in January 2000.  I flew out for some work
stuff, and got a one-way ticket, deciding that I was driving a bus back.  I
had plans to convert it to a waterpumper of some sort, and make it run on
propane (and still do - just probably not this bus).  When I bought it, it
barely ran because the large hoses between the intake manifolds and the air
distributor had big holes in them.  I purchased it anyway (for $900) and
then spent two days in the (very nice, helpful) PO's driveway repairing the
FI and replacing the alternator.  I then spent another week in Santa Rosa
(~100mi north), fixing it up for the trip back to Minneapolis.  The drive
here was great, and the bus ran like a top, even in the frigid weather.  I
have to say - driving a bus on ice in the wind is fun, in that masochistic
sort of way.  :)

Now for the details:

The Good:

94541.8 miles on the clock.  As far as I can tell, that's the correct
mileage.  It's got the original engine, from which my problem stems (see
&quot;The Ugly&quot;, below)

The PPO was kind to this bus.  On the dash, it's a got a tach, oil temp, and
oil presure gauges.  They're fairly tastefully installed, too.  The pressure
gauge isn't hooked up (the little adapter pipe is nowhere to be found), but
the sender's right there in one of the cabinets, so it wouldn't be a big
deal to connect it.

It's got early Vanagon front seats, tan fabric, which are quite comfy.  The
upholstery on the seats is in wonderful condition, but they were both
(strangely) missing left armrests.  I got a set of armrests from a list
member, but they're a bit tattered, and will need some help to look nice. 
You can still rest your arms on 'em, though.  These are the early seats,
with the shorter, adjuster-less armrests.

The PPO also installed an aftermarket cruise control system, which worked
fine after I replaced its burnt out relay.  As all the auto parts stores I
went to couldn't find me an appropriate relay, so I stole the one from the
aux. battery circuit, since there's no second battery installed.  The one
problem with the cruise seems to be that it occasionally disconnects the
chain that runs from the servo to the pedal linkage.  That can be repaired
with a ziptie, however.

The camping gear is in good order.  Stove works.  I haven't tested the
fridge (it was winter - I kept things in there so they'd stay warm), but it
_looks_ fine.  The poptop canvas is in good shape (a little hole or two, but
nothing bad).  Zippers and screen are intact.  The rear mosquito screen is
missing, as is the cot, though all the other camping gear is present (the
table, for example, and even the original fire extinguisher (oh!  how
useful!).  The curtains are there (including the big thing that goes around
the windshield and cab windows), though some of the straps that hold the
curtains back while driving are broken.

The bus is Dakota Beige.  There's a spare tire strapped to the nose, if you
like that sort of thing.

I replaced all 4 (mismatched, passenger car) tires with what Costco had, the
Kirkland Signature All Season Radial LT, 195/75R14 93/90Q M+S.  I can attest
that they handle quite well on snow and ice, as well as rain and dry. 
They have less than 3000 miles on them.

Before driving back to MN, I also replaced:
Front Shocks
Rear Brakes (shoes, wheel cyls, flexi-hoses)
Alternator (as above)
Flexible Steering Coupling
Steering Damper
The PO replaced the battery about 3 months before I bought it.

I changed the tranny lube (Napa 85W GL4), and there were some shavings on
the plug.  To tell the truth, I have no idea what the tranny's condition is
like.  It got me here, and it shifts fine and stuff, but I haven't taken it
apart or anything.

The FI seems to work well.  I say &quot;seems&quot; because when I tried to get it
past CA emissions, it acted like it was waaay rich.  Part of that could be
due to the spark plugs needing replacement, but most of it was probably all
the oil it's burning (see &quot;The Ugly&quot;).  It starts up, runs, and idles just
wonderfully.  There's no hesitation or loss of power or anything.  On the
drive back, I did get some power loss in the snow, but that was likely due
to ancient plugs and wires (I kick myself for not replacing those sooner.)
If it is running rich, it's likely that it just needs a new Temp2.

Now, the Bad:
The ignition switch is burned out, and there's a new switch, but it's
hanging next to the steering column on the wire.  It works (you unlock the
wheel with the key, and then start it with a screwdriver in the slot on the
switch), but the switch really needs to go back into the column.

The washer hose (tank to valve in column) leaks.  I made the mistake of
filling and pressurizing it before checking.  Oops.  Wet.

The poptop seal is (unsuprisingly) a mess.

The rear mosquito screen is missing, as is the child's cot.

Some of the plasticy fake-wood veneer on the cabinetry is peeling off, and
should be glued back down.

There's a bit of a scrape on the sliding door.  It looks like a parking lot
scar.  The door works fine, but it does have this dent in it...  There's a
little rust in there.

The rear bumper is kinda warpy, looks like it was bumped once or twice. 

&quot;The Hole&quot; for fuel sender replacement is there, and it's just duct-taped
up.  This comes as both a blessing and a curse, as the sender also needs
replacement (the original was dead.  I hacked one up out of junkyard rabbit
parts and the old sender, but it's still flaky).

The PPO replaced the front shoulderbelts with crappy retracting GM lapbelts
that don't fit.  I managed to find a driver's side seatbelt, but no
passenger-side one.  It'll probably need that, as the GM thing is crap, and
doesn't fit well between the seat and the door.

The following parts are rusty:
Under the windshield in the usual place, though it's not too bad.
The rain gutters in front (slightly)
Various rock chips on the nose
Under the rear side windows (above sliding door track, and the similar place
on the left side)
That scrape on the sliding door
Some spots around where the door seals meet the frame.
There's little or no rocker/undercarriage rust.  It's a California bus, and
shows signs of being parked outside in the rain, if anything.  It hasn't
been driven in the salt, except for the trip back here, and I've been
careful to wash it.  Overall, the body is in good shape for a 22-year old
machine.  

And finally, The Ugly:

Compression's really low in Cyl #1.  It tested at 100 cold, with all the
plugs out; 75 warm, with the others in.  If I put some oil in the cylinder,
it jumps up 25lbs (bad rings.  yay.) This is what's causing me to sell it,
as I can't afford an engine, nor the parts/time to do a rebuild in the next
month, and I can't trust it to carry me back to California in the heat, over
the mountains and all that.  One of the lifters has refused to pump up after
sitting all winter, so it's noisy, but on top of the noise I can hear
something that sounds much harder and (to my admittedly untrained ear)
bad-rod-bearing-like coming from the right side (the flat lifer's on the
left)  Either way, this engine is toast.  It runs and drives, but I can't
go anywhere with it.

Also, it'll need a complete set of fuel lines - it smells like gas whenever
it goes around a corner, and you have to hold the nozzle _just so_ to keep
from spilling gas everywhere when you fill it.

In short, this bus could be a good daily driver/camper with just the
addition of an engine (say, an AVP longblock for $1029 - the one that's
there oughta be a good core), though with a bit of work, it's a good
restoration candidate too.  I'd like to get around $1000 for it (less than I
put in), as it's worth quite a bit more just in parts (esp. with the new
tires).  Of course, since I'm leaving real soon, I'm perfectly willing to
negotiate.

So, anyway, if you're interested, p-mail me or give me a call at
612-381-0763. I'm available pretty much all the time (work at home).  I get
up around 10am-ish and go to sleep around 1am-ish.  I'm located in
Minneapolis, Minnesota.
