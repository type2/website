Subject: Re: [T2] Re: AC in Southern Buses (Long, sorry, I'll shut up
  now)

Joe, for the moment I will just comment on your AC unit ;-), it is yet a 6th
variation on bus AC systems I have seen, yours is NOT the same behind
drivers seat versions the westy got, it has different ducting, is it
installed in a passenger bus?

Also while the AC may have been made by &quot;VPC&quot; it was most definately
advertised in the VW Accessories Borchures of the time (perhaps ads too) as
a &quot;VW&quot; dealer option.
