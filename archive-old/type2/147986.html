Subject: Re: [T2] Warning : What a bad clutch driven plate will do to
  your bus

There is a term for this phenomenon that is popular among the LBC 
(little british car) crowd. &quot;Shipwright's disease&quot;

&gt;12) to preserve the new bearings and optimize oil cooling replace the
&gt;old -full of gunk- oil cooler
&gt;
&gt;hopefully there is no 13 !! Summer looks promising :-)

from a page on www.oldholden_dot_com.....

In LBC terms it goes something like this:

The glovebox light is out, I'll just replace the bulb, but look, the 
contacts are a bit corroded, so I better put in a new socket. To do 
that I have to pull out the glovebox itself, and look here! The 
heater is leaking. I'll just pull off the leaking hose and whoops! 
The core is rusted. Off with the dashboard, out with the heater core, 
and oh my, there's rot in the firewall. IN the engine compartment, I 
take out the battery to see the rot, and I can't weld the patch on it 
without taking out the engine, so out with the hoist. While the 
engine's out I might as well rebuild it, and the transmission and 
clutch. And I noticed that the shocks are shot, so off with them, and 
the suspension bushings have seen better days, but look! The spring 
tower's cracked, so I have to weld it, but I can't get at it without 
removing the body, so....

...so replacing the glovebox bulb led to a frame-up restoration.
