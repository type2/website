&gt; What does everyone recommend using to clean the fiberglass on a Westy
pop-top?

Depending on how dirty it is, ZAP worked wonders on my poptop. Before, it
was almost black with stains and molds. It now looks only slightly used, not
ready for the crusher like before I cleaned it.

Be sure to use gloves because this is a combo of sulphuric and muriatic
acids...Ugly stuff, but it works great!

I picked it up at my local Wal-Mart. I have seen it also at home and garden
centers as well.

Good Luck!
