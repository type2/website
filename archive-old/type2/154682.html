Subject: hello 

Hello to all just a short one to say hi
I currently am working on a heavily modified Double cab as the whole btm was 
gone (I basically swept it up off the floor ) so to even save the shell was 
a big effort  if your a purest then this is not for you I see it as saving 
at least the body

my other project is a 69 squareback this now has a type IV engine in it so 
lots of fi questions coming


if peeps want to see pics let me know and I will send link

so anyway

Skinny
