&gt; I would like to know of souces for a/c...

I know that these are almost, like, totally anathema, but just how do those
RV rooftop units work?  12v?  120v only?

The only one that I've worked on, just to clean the housing for a friend,
seemed to be self contained.  As I was not interested in who it worked at
that time, I didn't think to ask him.

Thanks.
