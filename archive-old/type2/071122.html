Subject: headlights not working
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

OK i have a big prob well not huge but i can't drive at nite. My headlights 
don't work. All other lights work just not the headlights. If someone could 
lead me in the right direction to fix them it would be great. Yes the bulbs 
are good. Thanks
