&lt;&lt; The company is called &quot;BeetleMex&quot; and they import a new Mexican beetle with

an old american vin number.  I wish the bus could be done this way.

I think you can get them in (pretty difficult) but you can't register them.

It has something to do with emmisions or safety regulations I think. Some

guy is selling on for $11,000! That's a pretty expensive parts car!

 &gt;&gt;

Part of it is protectionist legislation for domestic production, and some
of it is safety. Quite a few models of mainstream cars and a few low
production independants aren't up to donating four vehicles for crash
testing in addition to the smog tests...
