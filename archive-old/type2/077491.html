Subject: Re: [T2] cloth seat covers?


Karl,

To my knowledge, this bus has never been touched that way&lt;grin&gt;.
132,000 original miles and the engine appears to have never been out of it
yet.

The seat covers on *all* the seats are a &quot;red&quot; vinyl with what appears to
be off white looking cloth inserts.  The panel trim is the same
&quot;red&quot; vinyl with what appears to be &quot;chrome&quot; lines embeded in it.


The front window cranks and the dash are a very dark brown.

The outside colors are a dark red? over brown with graphic stripes(3) down
each side.

It is not a camper.  It has a walkthru between the front seats and a
middle and back seat.  No sun roof.  

It was manufactured in March of 1978, the vin number starts out as 2282.

What is it?

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Or do you have later Vanagon seats in yours?

&gt;  
&gt; &gt; On my 78 bus, I have seat covers that are partially cloth....any leads on
&gt; &gt; where to get replacements that are not all vinyl?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The only replacements I have found so far are all vinyl.
