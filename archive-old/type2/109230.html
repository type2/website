Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pump Going Bad ?

My bus once jerked like crazy.  Turned out to be a shorting wiring
harness for the FI.  You said that your bus was a 75, are you
referring to manufacture year or model year?  I have two 76's, which
are the model years, but both were built in 75 according to the
plates on the bulkheads, but were sold in 76.

  Are you carburated or FI?
