Subject: [T2] 1700 heads

I need to get the heads on my 1700 engine rebuilt or replaced.  Where is a
good place to ship the heads to have them rebuilt?  What should I expect to
pay?  Would it be better in the long run to buy new/rebuilt heads or have
mine redone?  Any and all suggestions are appreciated.

Take care,
