Subject: RE:weberazation

&quot;I disagree...
I have the single Weber on my '78
I've been getting 20 mixed and 25 highway for years&quot;

YMMV- I dont have the single anymore- I have 34 ICTs,
and I was talking about them. mine are tuned for
balance and starting- I dont have an exhaust sniffer,
so I cant tune for milage (without risking a valve). I
was asking about them.

I am curious about your milage tho'- other then the
carb whats your setup? Ignition/distributor etc.? Im
assuming a 2.0L engine. The best I ever gor with any
buss was 22/20, and that was a hard top.

Later
Duncan
