Subject: Re: Ruminations on heating a VW bus

&gt; However, in addition to uncontrollable VW bus lust, I am also a fan (and
&gt; owner) of a BMW motorcycle or two.
&gt; Us BMW folk use an electric vest that plugs into the bike. (How else
&gt; would we be able to ride twelve months out of the year?)
&gt; I simply installed the same DIN plug onto my bus, and plug in. Voila!

DIN plug, which is aka the &quot;Silver Socket&quot;, usually found in '74 and '75
Westies right under the glove box. :)
