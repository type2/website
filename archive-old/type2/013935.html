&gt; &gt; If this is true, then if the distributor drive is 180 degrees off, as

&gt; &gt; This would seem like a good reason to rotate the drive rather than move
&gt; &gt; the plug wires.  My camper's previous owner installed the drive backward
&gt; &gt; so the first thing I ever did to an acvw was pop out the drive.
&gt; 
&gt; Could you please describe how one does this (gets the distributor drive in
&gt; backwards), and how one recognizes the condition? I did this once while
&gt; rebuilding my '78 Westy's engine 7 years ago, but I've forgotten what I
&gt; did and what it looked like. Since then I've had this vague dread about
&gt; removing my distributor for any reason (lest I do it again), but I'd like
&gt; to do it now. A little refresher discussion of this problem would really
&gt; help me.

The distributor only goes in one way, so you can rest easy about removing it.  When you put it back, you push down while turning the 
distributor rotor.  When the drive dog matches the offset slot in the drive gear in the case it will drop into place.

The distributor drive gear (which stays in the case) has several teeth, so it has several different possible orientations, only one of which is 
&quot;right&quot;.  If it is positioned wrong, you simply lift it up off of its mating gear, rotate it, and drop it down in the correct position.  The 
complicating factor is that it takes a special tool to get hold of the drive gear.

&gt; I recall that hand cranking the engine and looking at the order of valves
&gt; lifting (back and forth under the bus and behind the bus, through a
&gt; whole compression and exhaust cycle and thinking about it) convinced me
&gt; that it was a problem. That and the bus wouldn't start, of course. I think
&gt; it was something to do with the TDC indicator tic on the fan coming around
&gt; twice in every cycle and getting it on the wrong one before I dropped the
&gt; distributor drive in.
&gt; 
&gt; Please remind me, since it seems fresh in your memory?

This could be.  Just get it to TDC on the compression stroke (both valves closed) on #1, and check the drive gear orientation against the 
picture in Bentley.  Note that there are different orientations for the type 1 and type 4 engines.
