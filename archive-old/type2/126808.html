Subject: Re: [T2] bus idles high when warm

Hello Mike    We just corrected this problem on Maddogs bus at Paddyswagen 
last weekend. The vacuum lines were reversed he had the deaccelaqtion valve 
hooked up wrong.  Go to the type2 list check in the library under vacuum hoses, 
Richard Atwell has a very nice diagram of these there,  I think that you will 
find this is your problem  later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import
