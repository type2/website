&gt; I recently started driving my 79' panel van that I bought back in

&gt; stiffer than my 77' westy, at first I thought of the tires, but they
&gt; are the same as the ones on the 77', This thing drives like a TANK,
&gt; very little body roll. Is this because these vans were intended to
&gt; carry heavy loads and VW beefed up the suspension?


Mostly, because it is EMPTY.  The camper has a few hundred pounds of
goodies in there, that settle the suspension a bit, and add more &quot;force&quot;
to the motion of the body.  The panel has none of that...there is very
little weight to cause the suspension to work.

Just like in a pickup truck._dot_usually with nothing in the bed, it is very
stiff and bouncey back there.  Add a decent load, and it rides smooth.
