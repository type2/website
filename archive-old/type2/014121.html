Baseball fan keeps on trucking after van burst into
flames

BOSTON (AP) - The Curse of the Bambino hasn't stopped
a 29-year-old Navy veteran from visiting every
baseball
stadium in the country, even though his 1970
Volkswagen bus burst into flames near Fenway Park.
A firefighter told Carter Richardson on Friday the van
was a victim of the legendary curse, which some
believe has kept the Boston Red Sox from winning the
World Series.
The Red Sox, one of the most dominate teams in the
early 1900s with five titles, haven't won a
championship since 1918. The Red Sox sold Babe Ruth -
the Bambino - to the New York Yankees in 1920. The
Yankees have won 26 titles since then.

The van, named &quot;Breeze&quot; after the vehicle driven by
Kevin Costner in the film &quot;Field of Dreams,&quot; had
already been to 20 ballparks.
&quot;Breeze went out in a blaze of glory,&quot; said
Richardson, who had bought the vehicle for dlrs 2,400
in California about three months ago.
He did manage to save most of his belongings,
including about 20 bobble-headed slugger dolls and a
baseball cap-ice cream dish from every stadium he's
visited.
Richardson also got to see Friday's night game against
the Orioles - from seats he called &quot;amazing.&quot;
&quot;My friends and I were really sitting where Kevin
Costner and James Earl Jones were sitting in the
movie,&quot; he said.
Richardson took a train to New York on Saturday to see
the Yankees and the Mets. He plans to take a train to
Philadelphia to see the Phillies on Monday, and then
fly to San Diego to pick up his Volkswagen Jetta and
drive to the remaining seven ball parks.
Richardson went to Arizona to see the Diamondbacks
play in June after he was discharged from the Navy. He
bought the Volkswagen bus soon afterward, imitating
the bus that Kevin Costner drove to Fenway in the
movie
&quot;Field of Dreams,&quot; which is about a son who connects
with his father's ghost after building a baseball
diamond on his farm.
&quot;I've been having the greatest time of my life,&quot;
Richardson said, &quot;and I still have 10 more stadiums to go.&quot;
