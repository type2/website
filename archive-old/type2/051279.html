Subject: [T2] HELP!!  CV Joints!!

Hi all:

I removed the CV joint that was full of transmission oil that I wrote
about last time in order to clean it up and repack it.  I reassembled
it, properly I think, but I'm having a problem.  The central hub of
the CV joint (that thing with splines that fits on the axle itself)
WILL NOT MOVE!  The cage moves back and forth, the balls move back and
forth, but that central hub won't move at all, even if I put
considerable pressure on it.

This is making absolutely no sense to me.  The hub's only contact with
the rest of the CV joint is through the balls, right?  And if things
are loose enough that the balls will move out and back, why the heck
won't the hub move????

This is driving me crazy and any help (in explaining the problem, not
in driving me crazy) sure will be appreciated.
