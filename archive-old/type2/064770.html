Subject: Interval Washer Relay and Sad Day

Well today is a sad day, for the first time in 30+ years my parents
will not have a VW as a primary driver, the '90 Passat goes for a
'97 Legacy Outback, a testimony to VW's failure in recent years,
particularly in warranty support and training of service personel.
But they will always own the '77 Westy so all is not lost.

But on the brighter side I finally inherited the programable interval
delay relay that I gave mom as a gift 5 years back that allows you
to use the factory interval position as a continuoulsly variable
delay.  And the big news that we quandaried about before but I now
know, it works in either the '85 or in THE '78, which admittedly came
with the factory interval relay.  These relays were about $30 when I
last checked from Rapid Parts or other FWD VW people, majorly neat
and an excellent upgrade as winter approaches, will be doing duty in
the '85.
