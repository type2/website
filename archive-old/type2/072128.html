Subject: green plaid engine hatch cushion anyone?

i blitzed through a boneyard this evening to take inventory - to late to
make purchases. i saw a very, very nice green plaid engine hatch cushion
from a newly brought in donor. i remember how bad i needed one last year
and a listee came through. anybody want me to yank it tomorrow? some
curtains were there too.  - steve, in need of a rust-free driver's side
rectangle vent wing frame.
