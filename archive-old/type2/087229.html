Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny Questions for the Wee Morn.

Tyler,

Welded cage? as in welded it to both the tranny linkage and the rod 
linkage????  *bad, bad* PO!

If both sides and ya gotta pull the tranny to fix the circlip, then 
unscrew the pin in the center of the cage and take the tranny out to work 
on it...much easier than metal fillings in the eye.

Then you can pull the shift rod linkage and R&amp;R it also.

Goo on the trans is pretty much standard.....

Never would have believed that the shaft was coming out.....amazing!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Morning!
&gt; 
&gt; Well as per my previous post, the engine is out, and the input shaft *was* 
&gt; sliding out :-(
&gt; 
&gt; So I've been told that this is a circlip that holds this piece in. Here are 
&gt; my questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Repair or Replace, I am kinding leaning to replace, when I drove the bus 
&gt; home from the PO's place, I noticed that even with the clutch depressed the 
&gt; bus seemed to be &quot;dragging&quot; but not apparently because of the clutch. I've 
&gt; also noticed that the tranny is covered in thick goo. I am betting that if I 
&gt; check the fluid level I'll be in for a big surprise.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. How difficult to repair? Can it be done in the bus?
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Replace, someone in this bus' lifetime someone welded the shift linkage 
&gt; cage in place :-( So I am stuck as to removing the old cage. I am thinking of 
&gt; breaking out the drummel and going to town with some cutting disks. (I 
&gt; already have the new one in hand)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks as always, this is a great and helpful list. All of you people are 
&gt; wonderful.
&gt; 
&gt; Tyler.
