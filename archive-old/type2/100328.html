Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilding mechanical EGR valve on 78 Bus?

It sounds to me that you need a weird rubber bonded to metal seal. I 
couldn't figure how my valve worked until I saw a complete working unit.

Might try  Darron at 1-800-544-4357. He rebuilds them (for $200). I only use 
my $200 rebuilt valve every 2 years.
