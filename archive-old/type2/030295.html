I thing the &quot;official&quot; name is a slugging or pounding socket.  I agree
with John.  Especially since Harbor Freight will sell you a lovely 3/4&quot;
drive socket set for &lt; 50 bucks!

The quality is not the best in the world, but at 46mm, 46.2 vs. 46.5 is
not terribly important.  The sockets in the set will cover all VW rear
nuts and all the steering wheel nuts. I did buy a Craftsman slide bar, as
I didn't quite trust the HF bar, but still....
