Subject: RE: [T2] solar

Scott asked:
&gt;&gt; ...My task now is to set up a seperate fuse box for my solar.  Are there
any thoughts on this? &lt;&lt;

I'm assuming 12-18vdc.  Grab a blade-type fuse box from the under the dash
of a pick-n-pull Japanese car (unless you are partial to the old vw types)
and mount it in the space under the seat cushion behind the driver seat.
This is where I keep my gell cell batteries and power supply for the ham
gear, and where the 120vac fuse box is mounted on my '68.  Lots of space in
that box.  Now you have me thinking...solar back-up...
