Bob and Eric:

Bob, while I agree with everything you wrote to me, I refuse to allow my tax dollars 
to promote this foolishness and my air to turn toxic without putting up some kind of 
fight.  At the rate we are going, we ourselves (the governed and governed) are not 
going to allow ourselves the pleasure of operating the vehicle we all seem to have in 
common.

I work at a Ford dealer and see many new vehicles--a '95 Mustang most recently, a 84 
Westy last month--which can not pass somg tests.  I don't have a problem with this.  
Standards are set and met to be passed in the name of clean air whether that's what 
its really all about or not.

What I do have a problem with is the enthusiast who can not find obsolete smog parts 
because none have been produced in fifteen years being kept off the street whether his 
vehicle can pass the test or not.

Eric, you wrote: &quot;...it would be fairly easy to put in a system which diluted the 
exhaust with ambient air or diverted the vehicle exhaust in some insidious way.&quot;  Such 
a system exists.  Its called a smog pump and was installed on 1973 and later VWs and 
in other cars starting in the sixties.  Its only job is to take ambient air and mixes 
it in the exhaust so the amount of exhaust gasses appears to be reduced.  The numbers 
are lower in parts per million but the actual amount of pollutants is the same.

A sneaky way of diverting exhaust would be impossible to hide from any but blind smog 
techs.

Chris Berry wrote that keeping our vehicles tuned is the key.  A properly built, 
properly maintained VW engine can run clean enough to pass smog standards into the 
1980's.  We all have a responsibility to keep them running as cleanly as possible.

Atrition will eventually rid the road of most older cars but factories will continue 
to buy cars to crush in the name of clean air and yet their own tailpipe emissions 
will not be reduced.  Soon, dirty air and no older cars is expected to be the norm.

Fight this.

Todd

Again, sorry for the passion...this subject is burrowed deep into my head and the 
Packers are losing.
