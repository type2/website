Subject: Re: Oil ALL over top of engine, 78 2.0 (

The fact your drips start when hot first suggests something is wrong going
to the oil cooler, especially if you see oil in the air housing you
opened?.  If you heard it running, it may not have been on long enough to
get hot??  But I had a similar leak in a Westy traded to me (PO though it
was bad oil cooler) that started in ernest when warm, and careful checking
pointed to a pushrod tube seal that was misaligned when the PO pounded the
tube in (a no-no).  Likewise, a rear seal may not leak until engine is hot?
If you had a compromised oil cooler, it could be leaking into the housing
in the area furthest from its mount, explaining the leak when the pressure
relief valve feeding the cooler opens the passageway to the cooler.  As
with the above leak I fixed, it takes careful  cleaning of all surfaces
and a bright halogen shoplight to look at everthing while engine is
running.  Remove the bottom pushrod tube covering tin of engine to check
while running.
   Re poor power- did you do a compression check on this engine before
buying it or now when in bus?  Does the oil smell gassy?  How many miles on
engine?   If there is no hose going to air cleaner and it's converted-from
FI,  where does the output from the crankcase ventilation go (that little
black box on top that has a big hose coming from it)?  If it was blocked,
pressure may be building up in the case causing an oil output?
