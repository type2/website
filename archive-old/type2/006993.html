&gt;So, if I understand this test correctly, if you had a pressure guage you
&gt;could screw into the spark plug socket and a way to stop the engine from
&gt;cranking right at TDC, you could watch the pressure and listen for leaks if
&gt;any existed.

&gt;Could you use some sort of T connector to run from your air compressor to
&gt;the cylinder with a valve in between to make sure any leaks in/at your air
&gt;compressor don't affect the reading.
&gt;
&gt;I'm excited to hear that you MIGHT be able to make this tool for $50.

It's been a while since I owned a plane and watched an annual inspection but...

the way I remember it, there is a &quot;calibrated orfice&quot; fed with a specific
pressure.  The orfice size required varied with the engine (size?).  There
were two guages.  One verified the supply pressure to the orfice and the
other read the cyl pressure on the &quot;downwind side&quot; of the orfice.  If the
orfice is too big, the pressure will equal the supply pressure.
