Volks,

This weekend I replaced the rear brake cylinders on my 78 bus.

--begin Rant --

According to Bentley, you need to removed the brake
drum (including castelated shaft nut) and brake shoes to do this. After
wrestling with the castelated shaft nut
for a couple of hours, and despairing that I am not nearly strong enough for
this work, I gave up and replaced the rear brake cylinders without removing
the shaft nut or brake shoes.

It worked just fine. (Yes, I did remove the pin that holds it before
attempting to remove the nut).

This is not the first such experience I have had with Bentley. Bentley says
that you need to remove the engine in order to
replace the shift rod coupling. Experience shows that this is not true.

-- end Rant --

These shortcuts may not be news to bus guru's.

In the future, I will be aware that Bentley's procedure may not be the
simplest.
