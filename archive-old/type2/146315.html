&gt;I am running on a loaner motor and I was very impressed with the MPG, its a
&gt;DP 1600 with a 34pict and what I am figuring is that I was getting about
&gt;21-22mpg .... 

Hi Ian,

I run a brosol 30/31 (or is it 31/30?) on my 1600 DP and that sounds about
right. I have gotten 24mpg on perfectly flat terrain driving 53-55, but
normal highway driving at 55-60 gets me about 21-23 mpg. 

FWIW I believe the owners manual claims 23 mpg highway, so I've never tried
to tweak it for more .... 

Cheers,

John
