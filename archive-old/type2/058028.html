Subject: Re: : Easy Pertronix Install? Hah!

Chris and the list,

There are definitely at least two different types of Pertronix out
there. When I bought my first one (several years ago), it was the banana
(semicircular) base type.  It also had a round rubber grommet on the
wires.  I put this in my 009 dizzy and it didn't fit all that well but
it worked.  Later while doing some engine experimentation with carbs and
exhausts, I melted/fryed the Pertronix unit ( don't ask) : (  Anyway,
when I bought a new one, it has a square rubber plug that fits very
nicely in the hole and it has the circular mounting base.  This unit
appears to be designed especially for the 009.  Perhaps you can specify
which one or maybe this is all they make now, figuring that the 009 may
be more popular.  Don't know.  A call to the maker would be in order.
No doubt there are suppliers who have both versions in stock even though
they probably both carry the same part number.   Don't give up, they are
definitely worth having.  Don't expect dramatic changes in power, etc.
unless your old points system is in sad shape.  You can expect to say
goodbye to adjusting points and having your timing be stable.
