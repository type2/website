Subject: RE: [T2] Differences from vw pancake to Porsche 914 pancake

If you've gone as far as looking at going watercooled, you may want to
look at installing a aircooled 2.7 liter flat 6 and transmission from
the Chevy Corvair. I have this setup in my bus and I'm very happy. The
Chevy flat six is what VW should have done in the progression of their
engines. It easily doubles the horsepower of your bus. You can purchase
a kit that makes this a bolt in affair with only minor cutting and
reconfiguration of clutch and accelerator tube and shifter mechanism.
(although the shift mechanism is a little on the sloppy side. I intend
to fabricate a cable shift mechanism in the future.) Transmission can be
a 4 speed manual or a 2 speed powerglide automatic. And since the tranny
is matched to the engine, engine doesn't have to turn the high rpms it
would if it were mated to a standard VW tranny. It makes the purists
cringe, but if you want to be able to do long distance modern highway
speed driving, its one of the ways to go.

I'm looking to upgrade power on a vintage pancake bus, I've
researched converting to a watercooled, and that looks to be difficult,
the
next thing I was thinking, and have heard, that the Porsche 914 engine,
is a
direct bolt in, what is the differences between the vw pancake and the
914
pancake? Pros cons if you know.. I would appreciate it..
