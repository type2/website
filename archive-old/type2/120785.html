Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Topic What I learned about driving in Snow!

Laying a coat of Rain X on the glass would slow this process down--

The 12 volt JC Worthless &quot;miracle &quot; defroster's work about as good you
blowing on the glass--

I'd consider repairing ---updating the heating system in the Bus--maybe
adding a set of ambulance fans too--these keep the glass really clear in
the frigid  weather--especially with snow flying--

Later,

Friday Topic What I learned about driving in Snow! 
Hi All, 
It's been a colder Winter than the last few since I bought my first Bus
3 years ago. I bravely decided to try my hand at ski instruction this
year in the Mountains near Seattle. At 2000 feet they aren't the Rockies
but the snow is heavy and wet. My first time was good: Sunny sky's and
fun. The Bus handles GREAT ON snow. But I soon discovered DO NOT drive
an unheated (noheat will survive getting to that cab in 20?F.) Bus IN a
snow storm. I headed up to the pass one morning and the snow not only
hit my windshield but began to freeze and stick to it! Not good. Sheet
ice was forming. Yikes! 
Well, not only is ski instuction off for this year: I've added some new
things to my Bus TO DO list: Buy one of these plug in window defrosters
I found on JC Whitney, add a Cig lighter to plug the defroster into
(does anyone know if these realy work??), put in some MORE insulation in
the front, not to mention boosting and insulting the heating system. I'm
an avid skier so these are now must do's. 
Yes, VW type 2's are great on snow, but not in snow, that is if you like
seeing out the front window!!!
