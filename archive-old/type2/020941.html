Subject: the 221,000 mi engine is back in!
References: &lt;v01550104b7021ee2eba6_at_[216.241.130.47]&gt;

This talk about bus engines only making it to 160K!  Mine will hopefully
make it to Everybus with 221,000 mi on never rebuilt status. 
I just pulled it to change a bad friction disk.
Well, after much cursing about the fill pipe being in the way (bent it
in with the ass end of a tie rod fork) , I got the 78 engine back in
after changing muffler, heater flapper boxes, clutch, pressure plate,
front/rear seals, trans seal, and setting endplay.  I was given a 4 ton
hoist that I tried to use above the upper hatch to lift the engine after
sliding it under the bus, but you still have to tip it up 5&quot; to get the
hoist legs under- so it's just as easy to use 2x4 shims and a lever
under the heater boxes to tip it up to where the jack will roll under. 
I did use the hoist to lift the engine onto a work surface and lift it
back down.  This time I tied the board tied under the engine so it would
stay put as I centered the jack by tapping with a sledge. Worked fine;
tomorrow I hook everything back up.

&gt; &gt;140k on a Bus motor? You, sir, have impeccable car care skills.&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think this is all that unusual on original engines.  I rebuilt my
&gt; stock '79 calif. engine at 142k due to dropped valve seat.  All original
&gt; engine and heads.  I was the third owner and my bus spent the first 90k
&gt; doing mostly city driving in San Francisco.  I'm not sure how well it was
&gt; taken care of, but it was stock when I got it, which might be an indication
&gt; that it was maintained by someone who cared.
&gt; 
&gt; Buddy of mine is running his '78 with original engine/heads at around 145
&gt; k, but engine is probably going to be rebuilt soon due to oil leaks.
