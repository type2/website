Subject: upper shock bolt loose

I went out to drive the bus a little bit ago and as I headed out the door I 
saw the upper shock up front standing up unhooked with the bolt, intact, 
loose from the bus. Luckily the Jetta was available so I could head over to 
the University, I will put it back together when I get back.  I can't see 
any reason for it coming out, there is no rust in this area, and it hasn't 
made any funny noises. Has this every happened to anyone? Any ideas what 
would cause this or how I can prevent it from happening again? Can the 
threads strip out from inside the hole? I doubt that is the case but it has 
been normal everyday before, then suddenly it was loose.

Thanks,
Nathan
74 Bus
