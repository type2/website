Subject: flywheel seal

What orientation (location) is the flywheel seal on a 79 2 liter
supposed to be? I ask because IIRC it came off with out one in place. I
ordered the seal b/c seemed important. When i put it the crank (so that
it was located on the outside of the raised portion where the 5 bolt
holes are) and torqued it to 80 lbs. it caused the crank to be almost
solid. It took a lot of effort to move it just a little. So either i
installed the seal incorrectly, something is adjusted out of wack, or i
don't actually need it.
