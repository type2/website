Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Endplay Question

Michael,

This is one of the *more* important things to know how to do...*Where*  is 
your manual!!

Yes, there will be a *lot* of play without the flywhell/flexplate/shims 
installed.  The proper way to do this is to *read the manual* and 
understand that you measure the first time with 2 shims on and then find 
the correct thickness of shim to make the endplay come out where it is 
supposed to(factory specs).

I can't stress how important this is to do correctly!

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Endplay can only be checked with the shims and flywheel/flexplate mounted.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry about the way I phrased that question, just frustrated about my email situation.
&gt; 
&gt; What I meant to ask was:
&gt; 
&gt; Is it normal to have that much travel at the crank &quot;without&quot; the flexplate/flywheel, seal, and shims installed. 2.5mm just seems like so much. I will reinstall the flexplate and the shimms tonight to see if it relieves any of that &quot;travel&quot;. Then I'll check the endplay. 
&gt; 
&gt; Does the flywheel or flexplate contact, via the shims, something to decrease this travel? Say like the case or main bearing?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
