You guys are being hard a$$es about this.

If a person wants to park a vehicle and spend the night in a 'brownfield'=
 or a
big vacant parking lot, then why not? Someone would hassle him if he stay=

any more than a day or two anyway.

I'd stay at truck stops if it were me - much more secure.

If he wants to use the bathroom of a big corporate gas station chain to t=
ake a
'whore bath' and change his clothes - then what business is it of yours? =
Is
there a 'minimum pruchase' to use a bathroom? Haven't they taken enough m=

from us?

If a person wants to crash for a few days on a willing friends couch and =
do
some laundry - and the friend doesn't have a problem - or even have stuff=

mailed there -then who are you to disapprove?

People end up out on their ear in life alot. Some of us do not spend as m=
uch
of our life concentrating on the acquisition and maintenance of wealth as=

others.

The VW bus is kind of a symbol of freedom - for sure it is a symbol of
carrying your house on your back. Give the guy a break. Sometimes you hav=
e to
do whatever you can.

Yes, i think helping a bus owner who is down on his luck find a way to ge=

while he regroups IS a 'highest and best' use of this list.
AIRS has a similar purpose.

Matty - you can park in my yard and mooch power/shower/beer/internet acce=
