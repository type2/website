Subject: [T2] Re:[T2} Clutch cable replacement

Tim, list:
Very good point, Tim! And from my experience, the hole that the clevis
goes through is usually quite worn, too. A new lever is the easy fix,
but possibly made from unobtainium! Welding up and redrilling the hole
round again, will make the clevis and cables last another lifetime. A
dab of most any grease is a good plan, too, of course.

&gt;Expect to replace the clevis pin at the pedal end. There is no room for &gt;a
&gt;bolt and nut so you need a proper pin. Then use some penetrating fluid &gt;on
&gt;the adjustment threads and a wire brush to make that wing nut come off &gt;much
&gt;easier.
