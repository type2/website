Never say never, especially there's a VW involved :)

I did a left upper ball joint from a '70 Bug without removing the
torsion arm once, i don't recall how exactly and i'm sure it would 
be easier to remove the arm and put it under a hydraulic press,
in fact i'd say it's the only way to go, you can also exchange your 
old arms for (used) arms that allready have new ball joints fitted.
