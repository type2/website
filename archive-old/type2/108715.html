Subject: Ball joint advice.

Ball joint advice.

1969 Westie

My front tires are wearing badly on the out side edge only and the whole bus
has been whipping in the wind more that usual. I figured is was time for
shocks and alignment but when I took it to my mechanic to help, he said the
there was no need to align it now as the ball joints are shot. Bummer. I
looked in the Bentley and St. Muir and both seem to think this job is not
for the faint of heart. Bummer.
The FLAPS does not have German ball joints so I am gonna call bus depot to
get some good ones.

Questions: 1) I assume I should do upper and lower at the same time. Are
they the same part number? I think so.
2) Is it worth it to get the German parts?
3) What else do I need to order? I do not want to be stuck half way through
this job and not have the parts ready. Muir says something about the front
stabilizer bar parts that need be replaced.
4) Any insight would be great. This is my daily driver now and at this rate
will have no front tires soon, as I want to keep the back tires good for the
alignment.

I drove 100 miles today to get new shocks that I was assured were in stock
to find out they had only one. I was gonna get the gas adjust type, but they
did not even have the stock type. Bummer.
