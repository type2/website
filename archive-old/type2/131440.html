Subject: Poptop Hinges

Ah I forgot a second question I had about my poptop.

We currently have to lash it down inside to get it to sit straight.  On the 
drivers side back by the hinges it is pulled too close to the body, whereas 
near the front it sits up above the luggage rack about 1 inch.  The 
passenger side of the roof is fine.


I think the hinges are a little bent, but not enough to see.  Where would 
you look for the hinges?  Or do you have an alternative idea about what is 
happening with my roof.

Thanks again,
Aaron Vanderwerff
