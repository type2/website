&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; I took the cv joints out of our 71 the other day, and they're
&gt; shot.

First, how did you figure out that they were shot?  If noise, it's
obvious, but if you've found a defect in the CV they might not be bad.

Several years ago, just after I bought my bus, I pulled the CVs to
replace the boots.  I found that all four had pitted balls.  I was kind
of short of money at the time, so I replaced the two worst ones and
promised myself that I'd replace the other two when I had the bucks. 
Needless to say, the other two are still merrily doing their thing
about 80K miles later!  Since I wasn't getting any noise from the CVs
when I tore it down, I wonder about how much longer the other two
joints would have lasted?

Moral:  a pit or two does not a bad CV make!

&gt; I've ordered 4 new ones and am waiting for them to arrive so I can
&gt; put them 
&gt; in.
&gt; I'm wondering if anyone has ever tried modifying a cv joint so
&gt; that it 
&gt; could have new grease injected using a grease gun.  It would be so
&gt; much 
&gt; easier if I could just go under with a grease gun and gease the cv
&gt; joint 
&gt; while it's installed.  Well, I'll have 4 old ones to experiment with.
&gt;  If I 
&gt; come up with anything promising I'll let you all know.

An interesting idea.  You'd have to keep a second grease gun for CV
joint grease, but it would make it a lot easier to do.  

Another way to do it is to get a thin tube with a grease fitting
attached and slip it between the axle and the boot.  Those with
Rockford CV boots can even pop the &quot;big end&quot; of the boot off of the
flange and dawb the grease directly on the CVs!

Another idea:  How about drilling the stub axle lengthwise?  This would
be an ideal way to grease the CV as it would force the new grease
through the CV joint!  Getting the old grease out would be another
matter entirely!  :)
