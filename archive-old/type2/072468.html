Now we know the real reason for the speed increase a few years ago here in California!! The new, higher speed limit was backed by all the VW mechanics, in order for them to make more money on &quot;melted engines&quot;. WOO HOO!! Seriously, though, I have owned VWs for the last 25 years, most of the time going OVER 60 MPH, in an aircooled powered vehicle. The only wind problems I have experienced was not with the vehicle, but with myself, and the lack of good ventilation inside the vehicle!! Anyway, most of the time, I have changed the oil every 5,000 to 7,500 miles with absolutely no bad side effects. (Most engines I have had were 1600s, 1700s, and 2.0s).I think there are a lot of other factors that come into play, when it comes to engine longetivity. Yes, speed is one minor one, so is the quality of gas that is used on the engine. Here in the USA, it is  HIGHLY recomended that you put the 92 octane gas in your engine. AKA Super Unleaded. One other reason for internal problems that comes to mind, is the &quot;low quality&quot; work a lot of these &quot;mechanics&quot; perform. The engine in my bus was redone, before I purchased it, and before I knew it, the valve seat came off, damaging the piston head. The valves had signs of a meltdown!! The valves, as it turns out were stamped R.O.C, which means Republic of China!!! I have never had such ludicrous problems with an engine, which obviously was not put together with original German parts, but with inferior junk!! I have learned the hard way, because in the begining I used to buy the lower priced parts, to save money, but in the end I still had to go out and buy the real thing, because the cheap part did not hold up. PEACE&gt; Alexander Der Grosse.

Matthew-

Let me begin by saying that nobody is questioning your expertise.  And I'm 
sure that your experiences are just as valid as mine.
In a recent post a gentleman stated that according to the owner of a large VW 
repair shop when the speed limit was lowered to 55 MPH the number of busses 
that came in for engine work dropped by a large fraction.  This has been my 
experience also.  
I'm not a professional mechanic.  But I have years of experience with an air 
cooled bus.  And unlike you I have had problems.  The first engine in my bus 
lasted only 65,000 miles.  When I rebuilt it both heads were badly cracked 
and it had a burnt valve.  I had been driving at 65 to 70 MPH.  The &quot;common 
knowledge&quot; was that '71 busses had more power and with the relocation on the 
oil cooler they didn't overheat.  A CHT gauge would have told me differently.
Then I built an engine and didn't set the compression ratio correctly.  That 
one ended up with a holed piston after 35,000 miles.  I had an oil temp gauge 
at the time but it had a poorly designed sending unit that only read the case 
temp and by the time the case got hot enough for me to notice it was too 
late.  A CHT gauge would have saved that engine.
The next engine I had built by a small shop in Modesto, CA.  I had a dipstick 
oil sender installed at that time and a CHT gauge.  I drove by my head temp 
keeping it at or below 350 while cruising and below 400 while climbing hills. 
Sometimes the temp would go up to 425 but only for a short period.  That 
engine was going strong at 138,000 miles.  The reason I rebuilt it is that 
the transaxle failed the engine had lots of miles on it and it was out of the 
car.


&gt;   Do a little reading on the origins of air-cooled 
&gt;  motors for autos and you'll find this was one of the grand engineering 
&gt;  difficulties to overcome. During mountain climbing in winter temperatures, 
&gt;  the motor would cycle from its highest operating temps (450+), to its 
&gt;  lowest (&lt;100) in short time, then climb again.

This isn't my experience.  My engine will only go marginally below 200 
degrees on a down hill if the down hill is huge and it's very cold out.
  
&gt;  You assert: &quot;VW busses overheat.&quot; and &quot;...I'm driving a car that tends to 
&gt;  overheat...&quot; I'd disagree entirely. Overheating and failure in air-cooled 
&gt;  cars ONLY occurs at the hands of owners/drivers who maltreat their 
vehicle. 
&gt;  It is not a complicated relationship. Bad driving causes VW failure, 
&gt;  nothing else. Keep a stock VW motor properly tuned, keep it spinning over 
&gt;  and don't overwork it, and it won't fail you.

Overheating in an air cooled engine is very hard to define.  It's impossible 
to detect in a stock VW because there isn't a gauge.  To my way of thinking 
though if a bus driven at normal highway speeds 65 to 70 goes through engines 
every 65,000 to 75,000 miles.  And one driven with head temps typically 350 
or lower, with short spikes to 400 to 425, lasts twice as long.  The first 
scenario represents an &quot;overheating&quot; situation.
 
&gt;  My family has owned more than 20 air-cooled VWs since 1958 (our family car 
&gt;  was a Karmann Ghia convertible; our 1st bus was in 1961, seven busses 
&gt;  total). I can only guess that (collectively) we've driven those cars &gt;3 
&gt;  million miles. Not once in those miles have any of our VWs &quot;overheated&quot; or 
&gt;  sucked a valve. None of these cars had a head temperature gauge (two 914s 
&gt;  had oil temp gauges).

I'm impressed, your family collectively drives air cooled VW's over 71,000 
miles a year on average and has for the last 42 years.  
Unlike you I don't go through cars very fast. I've owned the same bus for 
almost 20 years, and for most of that time it's been my daily driver.  In 
that time I've found that busses run hot.  And the hotter they run the 
shorter their engines last.  The only way to reliably detect engine temp is 
with a CHT gauge.  I still drive 65 to 70, but only if it doesn't cause 
&quot;overheating&quot;.
The average person who owns a bus doesn't have a clue about this stuff.  They 
don't know that a head wind can cause their cylinder heads to heat up an 
extra hundred degrees if they maintain their same speed.  They can't detect 
when there is a slight grade causing an extra 50 degree temp increase.  A CHT 
gauge will tell them though.  And if they pay attention and do regular 
maintenance they can expect to double the life of their engine.  
 
&gt;  If having a gauge makes you happy, no big deal. If you drive easy, you 
&gt;  won't need it.

You're absolutely right about not needed it if I drive easy all the time.  
But I don't like to drive slow all the time and I don't like not knowing if 
I'm driving slow enough.  And you're also right about it being &quot;no big deal&quot;. 
 People are going to do what they want regardless of what we have to say.  
All we can do is share our experience as honestly as possible.

With my highest regards;
Tim
'71 Westy
