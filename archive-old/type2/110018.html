Hello Frank  How ya doing and I hope the kids and wife are doing well also. 
Have you checked the plugs to see how they are burning?? That would give you an 
idea if it is running rich. It could be the temp sensor, or leaky injectors, 
you need to break out the bentley and run some tests. Later and have fun
