Subject: [T2] Chrome Locking Gas Caps are Back!

Just a note to say that I have located what will almost certainly be my last
shot at '73-79 chrome locking gas caps.

The German supplier discontinued the locking ones about a year ago, and
replaced them with functional-but-not-original-looking black plastic ones,
leaving Volkswagen as the only supplier - at nearly $50.00!!  (At that price
they'd better be locking, since you could buy precious metal for less money
per ounce! :-).  SInce then I exhausted every source, including importing
them directly from Germany, and could not find a reasonable price anywhere,
so I'd given up on ever seeing them again.

Imagine my surprise when a hundred of them turned up at a liquidation sale,
having been ordered by a distributor that went belly-up before the
manufacturer switched to the plastic ones!  Of course I bought them all, and
can even honor my previous price of $15.95 (from before they went obsolete).
Current _wholesale cost_ is about double that price, so when these are gone,
that's it.

Part number is 211 201 551R. On the website or toll-free 1-866-BUS-DEPOT.
