Subject: Wipers and washing Westy interior

List,

The wipers on my 74 camper are stuck. Turns out that one of the wiper
shafts seized in the bearing which caused the wiper motor to end its
operating life.

Busdepot has the motor, but the online catalog does not show the shafts
(#9 and #13, Bentley p. 4-30). Does anyone have a used wiper assembly
for sale? Fried motor is not a problem as I have a new 68-72 motor (211
955 113H) that I could modify. The correct assembly would have a 211 955
113Q motor. If I find an assembly with working motor, my 68-72 motor
will be available.

Westy interior: someone mentioned a while ago that he washed his Westy
matress and bench covers successfully. What kind of detergent did you
use? Which temperature? The last time I cleaned Westy covers I took them
to a specialty dry cleaner - and that was neither cheap nor did I like
the dry cleaner smell. What makes a good Westy carpet cleaner (that does
not take out the original color)?
