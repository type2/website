Subject: [T2] Fan oil seal

&gt;68 Kombi

&gt; Is there an oil seal behind the crankshaft pulley on a single carb 68
&gt;bus?  the Bently manual says there is only one at the flywheel end.  My
&gt;engine seems to be leaking behind the main pulley and the belt is always oil
&gt;coated.  If there isn't a seal there, what is the procedure for stopping the
&gt;leak?

Do a compression test to determine if the source of oil leak at the fan end
( which has no seal on the type 1 ) is blow-by from worn rings.
