Subject: Re: [T2] Got the fuel pump to work, now what?

5 after is retarded. That is the timing spec for a 71 with a dual vacuum unit
with vacuum on the retard side connected.
IF you have the correct distributor on it, it is vacuum advance only and times
at 0.
IF this is not what you have:

&quot;Bus &amp; Pickup 1969-1970 * 1600

Distributor: VW 113-905-205T, Bosch 0231 137 035 or 036
Can Use: VW 113-905-205M, Bosch 0231 137 021
Replacement: VW 111-905-205AA, Bosch 0231 137 039
Points: 01 013
Points Replacement Plate Assy: 1237 110 139
Condensor: 02 007 - Note: If equipped w/AC use 02 069
Rotor: 04 033
Cap: 03 010
Coil: 00 015 (Blue Coil: 00 012)
Vacuum Can: 07 024 (Replacement uses 1237 121 400)
Ignition Wires: 09 001
Spark Plug: W8AC
Timing Set At:: 0deg TDC Static or _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe w/vacuum hose
disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum (Advance Only): 17-19deg _at_ 1.3 In. Hg, 32-35deg _at_
3.2 In. Hg&quot;

THEN there is no 'factory' specs to time it at. 1st you need to figure out
what you have, then time it to that dizzy. Specs given in any book or tune-up
manual are there for factory put-together engines. Deviate from that and you
can toss the book.

&gt; Hey all!
&gt;
&gt; I got the pump thing figured out.  I was finally able
&gt; to start the bus this afternoon.  The problem now is
&gt; that it runs very poorly.  In fixing the pump I had to
&gt; remove the distributor.  Now I reinstalled it and
&gt; timed the engine to 5 degrees ATDC.  It doesn't idle
&gt; well and I can tell that not all the gas is being
&gt; combusted.  I did everything in accord to the Muir
&gt; handbook, what could I be missing?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help.  If I can get it running good
&gt; again I will see some of you down at BNNTA.
