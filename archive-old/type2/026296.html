Subject: Smoke theory of electrontincs/ Long time no run
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD11011F4C72_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

My understanding of the smoke theory of electronics is that electoronic
components contain, and run on smoke.
If you let the smoke escape, the device stops working;-)

Regarding the van that didn't run a long time, don't let people make it
sound too bad. Mine sat for ten years,
and it got. New oil; new battery; oil sprayed into the spark plug holes.
Thats about it, and I've been driving it for
6 years since. One brake wheel cylinder is starting to seep fluid, but this
is after six years, so I wouldn't blame it on 
the storage.

NOTE!!!!!! ONE THING MY VAN SHOULD HAVE HAD NEW, BEING FUEL INJECTED WAS NEW
FUEL HOSES.
	   Unfortunately I only learned that after the FIRE!!!!! If  you
have a fuel injected van with fuel hoses over five years 
               old CHANGE THEM regardless of whether it has been sitting or
been driven. 
               DO IT!!!!! NOW!!!! Its a lot less work that the
pyro-forensic-archeology I went through figuring out how to 
               replace all those melted parts!
