Subject: I brought a new old bus home today!!!!

Hello All..

I just can't contain by excitement...so I had to share. I had a great VW 
adventure today from Cape Cod, MA to Coventry, RI.

I brought home a '63 bus. One of the most solid New England Split Window 
buses I have ever seen....heck... one of the *only* New England
splitties I have ever seen. There is no serious rust on this bus AT ALL. 
some  cutting will be required, but nothing major... all the typical
points of failure (rockers, doglegs, floor, frame) are rock solid. I'd 
been looking for a splittie for a while, and I had to jump on this one 
when I saw it.
I found some maintenance receipts in the bus from Phoenix, AZ from early 
90's... and a Colorado license plate... looks like this was a west 
coaster.... has a Los Angeles
Import code. Massachusetts Title from 2003.

I posted my day's log and some pics at:

http://www.gacker_dot_com/bus/log/01_07_06.html

The engine code is F2075172. Am I correct in saying that this could 
possibly be the original engine for this bus? Feel free to look at the 
pictures..
my web server is pretty slow, so bear with him...


Excited!!!
