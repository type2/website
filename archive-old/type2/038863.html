Subject: Stool, bucket, box?

I was just lucky, the camper I got had all this stuff:
Box between the seats, yellow covered bucket and the
stool. Also got a set of pot/pans that look cool too,
not sure of the VW connection for them. I will try and
get a page up with pictures and info on this stuff.
Maybe alternate sources can be found?
