Subject: LP gas tanks under bus

My 72 HighTopper has the built in LP gas tanks, but I have never used this 
setup before. My question is, before I go to doing any filling or using, is 
there anything I should do to these tanks or the connections? Was there ever 
any info put out about this setup? I kinda like my bus and dont want to blow 
it up :)  Also, any precautions about using the stove that hasnt been used 
in (?) years.

Thanks,
David
