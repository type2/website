Subject: New CV boots

Hey all,
I have a dead CV boot on my '81 Vanagon.  On Saturday I will be 
replacing it.  I wanted to give you all the lowdown on what I got for a 
replacement boot.

I ordered some CV boot kits from Ron at Bus Depot.  They are $9.95 each, 
and come with a Febi/Bilstein German boot, new CV bolts (the triple 
square kind), new snap ring, boot clamp, new concave washer (which 
Bentley says to throw away, hmmm), and a tube of 90 grams of CV grease 
(exactly the VW spec).  Not bad for $10! :-)

So I will keep you all posted on how it holds up, but it looks pretty 
good from here.  I wonder, though, VW says 90g of grease.  Is that 
enough or should I be using more?

Also, should I include the new concave washer or should I leave it out?

Also also, should I use the clamp supplied with the boot?  This is the 
clamp that goes around the small end of the boot.  I know some folks 
have recommended not using them based on the theory that they can 
contribute to the early failure of the boot, but then if it is supplied 
with the boot kit, perhaps I should use it.

Any advice will be appreciated.  Gonna get messy this weekend :-)
