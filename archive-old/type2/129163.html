Subject: Re: [T2] Jack

I've gotta chime in here on the side of the stock jack, if used
correctly, is pretty decent.

1)  As George sez, you must chock your wheels!

2)  Since the bottom of the jack is a mere little nub, put a nice piece
of 4-6&quot; lumber under the jack itself.  This evens the load over the
ground, and gives the nub on the jack a little something to dig into
besides hot asphalt, muck, etc...

3)  The angle of the jack will become more pronounced as you lift the
bus.  Look at the attitude, unscrew, and re-place so that it remains
vertical through the lift.  

But these are things I would do with ANY jack. Chock wheels,
support/level jack, check and adjust attitude.  It's always handy to
have a few pieces of sturdy wood to shim a jack if you're on a slope,
right?

Happy Jackin'!
