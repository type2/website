&gt;   Otherwise, to check if you have a battery drain with everything switched
&gt; off, connect a test light between your battery positive terminal and the
&gt; disconnected positive lead.  If the light glows with everything turned off,
&gt; something is draining your battery.  Disconnect things that you suspect until
&gt; the light goes out.

The big thing to remember, while testing for a &quot;leak&quot; in your electrical
system.... make sure you have the dome lights off,, and if you have a radio with
preset memory,,, it will cause a small glow in the lamp also,, you might want to
disconnect it also.
If you find the lamp glows,, remove each fuse and see if it goes out,,, if not,,
you have to look at things ahead of the fuse panel in the wiring diagram.... 

Let us know what happens with the lamp test
