Yep, this but this is not for isocynates, bet your life (literally?)
read the standard organic vapor cartige, even with the carbon pre-filter
and it will say such, as I've said I have used these in a pinch,
certainly better than nothing and OK for regular finishes.  The paint
store one I mentioned is like $20 for the mask, $40 for cartriges
but is rated for the job.
