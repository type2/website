&gt; Was talking to my mechanic Sam tonight and he said it would be a good idea 
&gt; &gt;to install an electronic ignition in my bus (1600 Single). He said that 
&gt; then 
&gt; &gt;you don't have to worry about the points or timing anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Been running problem free for 1 year on Pertronix.
Rock solid Dwell and timing.
