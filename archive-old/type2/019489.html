Hi Max,

In my 74 Westy, I noticed a similar fuel odor.  It was stronger with a full
tank.  I found the fuel filler hose from the filler pipe to the tank had
deteriorated and was leaking.  Repair was fun as I had to remove the engine to
remove the tank to get at the hose.  If you have a large plate on the right side
of your engine bay, it's removal will facillitate the repair.   You could also
check for a puncture to the tank.  Maybe, you just have a poorly sealing fuel
cap.  Depends on how your luck is running.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt; Anyway, the problem that we became aware of was a distinct smell of fuel as
&gt; we slept.  The smell comes from the right hand side as you look
&gt; to the front and comes from the area above the petrol cap. I have recently
&gt; replaced the fuel tank breather hose which I thought would clear up the
&gt; problem but it hasn't. The PO did some modification to the interior is there
&gt; a chance that he could have punctured the tank.
