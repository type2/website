Those are heater ducts....they are on my 71 anyways...
they blow some SERIOUS heat!! it actually gets HOT!  those 2 ducts heat my
entire bus and make it nice in the winter...along with the smell of heat
coming out of my defrost vents :) actually...my defroster works pretty good
at higher RPMs...

there are vents that go onto those ducts....I haven't seen too many of them
as they usually got taken off from what I can tell.  they look like vacuum
cleaner attatchments.

mine were plugged too when I got my bus...someone thought it would be a good
idea to put fiberglass insulation throughout the heating system!

those ducts are nice though...especially if you have a westy interior in
it...when you crawl into the bed after driving for a while (at a rest stop or
something...or cruising around with your favorite lady ;) they heat the
forward part of the bed up a little bit....and then the engine heat can heat
the rear part of your bed up.... so I always say Stella has a heated
bed...now if thats not a chick magnet I don't know what is!!  a heated bed in
a VW bus has some serious power....


anyways......I still can't figure out how those are routed to the heating
system...but they are...

later


&gt;  two uncovered ducts where the
&gt; firewall meets the floor. The ducts were packed with this junk,
&gt; definitely blocking any air flow that was supposed to be happening - I
&gt; was able to get it all out however.
&gt;
&gt; It looks like there are supposed to be covers that form the top of these
&gt; ducts - any idea if these are available, and where to get them?
