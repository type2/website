Subject: Re: [T2] split Handbrake as pseudo diff-lock for off-road use!!!
References: &lt;p04320404b64bf7841aac_at_[212.140.71.10]&gt;

Unfortunately i don't speak german but, going by the diagram i don't see how
the brake set up differs from normal as it appears it is all actuated by the
stock lever and not independent for each rear wheel, of course i'm sure i'm
missing something so maybe someone who does speak german could offer a
translation as i am interested in this.  I am planning on purchasing a
standard bus sometime in the next few yeas and outfitting it per &quot;journey's
under difficult conditions&quot;  I think this would make for an interesting bus
and modified only per vw specs. My westy is already too heavy to be adding
anything to and i want it stock.
thanks alot

&gt; He has also installed two extra handbrake leavers in his van to
&gt; breakdown a whell tha is free spinning when stuck in the mud or sand.
&gt; Sounds like a very good idea and the setup is great as it does not
&gt; interfere with normal handbreake function.
&gt; Has anyone got experience with this? or any thoughts?
&gt; The deails are on:
