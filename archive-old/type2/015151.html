Subject: ID on Westy Hitch
Mime-Version: 1.0

Can anyone translate the following found on a Westy Hitch of a non-
subscriber??

WESTFALIA-WERK WEIDENBRUCK
Typ # 321 022
Bauj.  1970           (Built in 1970?)
Prufz ~~ F 136        (Tested?)
2300KG
Gepr fur 1200KG       (max. weight?)

It appears to be a hitch for the 1970 bus as it does not fit the '78
bus of the owner, who might be willing to part with it.  Please respond
to him about purchase stuff and maybe post identifying info to the list
for others to see??

Owner is Chris &lt;JordanVw_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

No affiliation, RMMV, etc., 

Craig in CO
'78 Deluxe Westy
