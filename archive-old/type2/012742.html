Hiya all,
     I've dusted off the cobwebs and updated the MacOS/Sherlock plugin 
for the archive searches to reflect the new location of same. Slight 
bug-Sherlock is a little confused by the way htsearch returns 2 links per 
result, and it lists both URLs as a match. So, you get duplicates in your 
list of results. I've wasted enough time on this for today, I'll figure 
out some sorta hack to remove the dups later. Maybe this weekend, but no 
promises.

     Getcher plugin here:

http://www.hintz_dot_org/pub/Type2.src.hqx

     Once you've got it on your desktop (or where ever you download stuff 
to), drag and drop it on top of your *closed* System Folder. In the box 
that says someting about it needing to go in internet search items click 
OK. Open Sherlock, it'll be under the &quot;My Channels&quot; button. Search for 
something. If it works, you're done-Drink Beer. If anybody has problems, 
holler, and if possible include you search string (whatever you type into 
sherlock) and I'll try to figger it out...

No clue if it works under X. Will test later. Must go get some real work 
done.  ;-)


Peace,
