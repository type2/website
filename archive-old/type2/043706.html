Subject: [T2] Stuck case studs, HELP!
Content-Disposition: Inline

Hi Vanners
I was removing the case cyl studs from a Type 4 case and 6 out of 8 aint
bad but one broke off close to the case and the other wont budge in
spite of heat and penetrating oil etc etc.
I will have to try welding a bolt to the broken stud but it is the one
closest to the trans flange.
HELP needed and thanks from Jack in Gulf Breeze, FL
