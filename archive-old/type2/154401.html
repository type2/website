Subject: RE: [T2] oil filters and oil

&gt; &gt; 20/50 might be the way to go, but I've run 40wt for years in the 2
&gt; &gt; liter with no ill effects.  In the very hot triple digit weather of
&gt; &gt; Northern Cal in August/September I even ran 50wt in my 80 Vanagon.


In a sense an &quot;air cooled' engine is just as much an &quot;oil cooled&quot; engine.
These engines can get hot, and the Type 4 engines in particular don't like
that much. In my Type 4 engines I have generally run 20W50 in the
spring/winter/fall, and straight 40 weight in the summer (PA, often 85-90
degrees or more).  I had a conversation with a rebuilder many years ago (not
positive but maybe Leonard at AVP?) who pointed out that multi-weight oil's
viscosity will tend to break down over time such that a 10W40 oil ends up
functioning more like a 10 wt oil; hence the potential advantage of
straight-weight oil in climates where cold-weather starting is not an issue.
