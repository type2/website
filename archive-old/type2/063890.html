&gt;Did anyone ever respond to Pat's question about BTU's on these heaters?
Yes.  This information is courtesy of Ron Van Ness:

     Early model 12v BN4 (71-earlier bus):

     Heat variable from 1080-4000 kcal/hour
     Fuel consumption  0.2-0.65 liters/hour
     Operating range  10-14V
     Nominal voltage  12V
     Current Draw  50 watts
     [didn't find mention of CFM]


     Late model 12v BN4 (72-74? bus):

     Heating capacity from 4,000-16,000 BTU
     Hours/Gallon of fuel: U.S. 6-16.5
                           IMP  7-18
     Power consumption  50 watts
     [again, didn't find CFM mentioned]

And the documentation from Carver states that their models 1600 and 2600
put out 1.6kW and 2.6kW respectively.  The problem comes with all these
units.  First of all, I can't find any mention that kilowatts is a term
related to BTUs.  The closest I could find (at
http://www.inotek_dot_com/conversions.html, a cool URL for this sort of thing)
was kilowatt-hrs.  To convert kilowatt-hrs to BTUs, you multiply by 3,413.
Therefore, the 1600 would put out 5460.8 BTUs (I know that's too many
significant digits), and the 2600 would put out 8873.8 BTUs.  Again,
that's assuming that when the Carver documentation says kW they really
mean kW-hrs.  To further complicate things, at one point the Carver doc.
calls this &quot;heat input&quot; and another place calls it &quot;heat output&quot;.  As for
the BN4's, I'm afraid I give up on kcals/hour and how that relates to
BTUs.  (Ha, assuming it isn't the same THING as BTUs!  I should have paid
more attention during Chemistry.)

&gt;As my 79 westy has had no perceptable heat in the 7 years I've had it;
&gt;I am getting older and feeling the cold;  and I've heard that the gas
&gt;heaters are trouble prone,   this little propane number sounds like a good
&gt;fix.   I have asked Carver to quote me a price and approximate shipping
&gt;charges to USA,  and if anyone is interested in their reply, I will post it
&gt;here.  The unit is designed to mount on a floor, with both incoming
&gt;combustion air and outgoing exhaust going through the floor.  ( Mmmm, I have
&gt;to think about cutting those holes for a minute )
Did you see Steve Johnson's post that it's about $570 for everything,
including shipping?  If I were to go this route, I'd use the disposable
canisters because my bus doesn't have a built in tank.  But the only ones
I've seen in stores are (I think) 1.6 lbs, which according to my
calculations and the figures supplied by Carver would come out in the
neighborhood of 5 hrs. or so of usage.  This is one reason I'd probably
prefer a BN4.  I think 5 lb. tanks are available but I haven't looked into
it yet.  (It's still warm here.  :-) )
