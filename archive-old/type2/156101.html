&gt; Hey guys  what ever became of the hybid that VW developed that had  
&gt; the  3 cly
&gt; diesel and electric. Ran on electric under 35mph and switched to  
&gt; diesel  over
&gt; that with the diesel recharging the batteries. Supposed to have gotten
&gt; 165mpg .  I know the limiting factor is still the batteries size  
&gt; and  capacity.
&gt; Wouldn't that make a great motor system for a bus.

According to Wikipedia, Ferdinand Porsche created the first petroleum- 
electric hybrid. If that's correct, then hybridizing the type 2 is  
already in the vehicle's genome.
