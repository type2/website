I checked the archives and am still not exactly clear on this subject (i.e. 
excuse me if this is a FART).

I have a 1980 Vanagon Westfalia.  I'm currently putting a rebuild in.  Prior 
to my last trip, no EGR light on; during trip, EGR light on.  Burnt hole in 
cylinder head # 3 in TN.  Now, swapping motors in FL.

ANYHOW, I am definitely mechanically illiterate (trying to learn, though).  
As I examined my motor, I realized that while I do have the EGR tube leading 
from the manifold (?) down to the plate in vicinity of # 4 cylinder, there 
is nothing underneath.  I have the Hayes manual, &amp; found that this is where 
the EGR filter goes, then on to the catalytic converter.

I'm not exactly clear on how to determine if my Vanagon is Fed. vs. CA.  
Unfortunately, w/no EGR filter, I have no part # to reference.  I'd been 
talking w/VEE PARTS (any comments?) about the part, &amp; a person there asked 
for my VIN to determine which model I have.

I saw a msg. in the archives saying 80 Vanagons don't have the EGR.  Huh?  
Other msgs. went along the lines of &quot;you don't need it, anyways.&quot;  Putting a 
&quot;new&quot; motor in, I want everything I NEED to ensure I'm not wearing it 
out/damaging it prematurely.

Input/help would be most appreciated.

Thanks,

Mark
