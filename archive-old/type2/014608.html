My two cents worth,

Mark and I have very close to the same engine (I have a non-stock exhaust
system, extractor with a Dynomax muffler).  Its been three weeks since
installing the Miller CIS FI kit, I have a bit over 1K miles so far and the
improvement over the dual Delorrtos is evident everytime I turn the key to
start my next adventure.

Money well spent in my book!

  &lt;&lt; Should I tune the webber, swap for the duals, or try to sale/trade the

  which runs and is almost complete(no it does not have a stool) for a set

  dual webber 44's. &gt;&gt;
  
  or how about D), NONE of the above!!  you should really consider fuel 
  injection.
  
  After personally owning buses with stock single solex, stock duel solex
and 
  aftermarket duel weber ICT, and IDF systems,  I personally would choose 
  either the stock bus L-jetronic FI or a conversion to K-jetronic (CIS) FI
ANY 
  day over carbs.
  
  My current bus with a stock 1800cc engine has a K-jet fuel injection 
  conversion with components from a late 70's rabbit/jetta.  It outperforms
any 
  carb system I have ever had.  More power, evenly distributed throughout
the 
  rpm band, no linkage adjustments or balancing, imediate cold starts in
below 
  freezing weather, its much quieter and the fuel distributor constantly 
  adjusts fuel delivery for demand, altitude, temperature etc.  NO
electronics, 
  its all mechanical.  It passed the 79 model year emmission tests with
flying 
  colors.
