hope people don't mind me posting this to the typ2 air cooled list :)

I was out at lunch today and was walking down the street when what should I
see..

a 1993 Eurovan DoubleCab being used by a local tree removal service (almost
made me want to switch careers :)

I talked to the fellow briefly and didn't seem particulary interesed in it
or its' rarity.

For people in Toronto that want their tree's removed by a professional with
a kewl Eurovan DC  contact:
