Subject: Late Type II Rebuild For Sandrail
To: VW Type II List &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hello,
I am new to the whole VW arena.  I have a '76 2.0 that
needs a complete rebuild.  The original owner ended up
blowing the oil pressure guage line pumping all oil out
until seizure.  I assume the crank and rods are waisted. 
If you could direct me to the best method to follow on
rebuilding this engine that would be great.  It resides in
a sandrail at the moment will continue to do so after
resurection.  What part houses work best.  Anything would
be appreciated, it is hard enough to get answers from
people that are true Type I followers.  I am willing to
build the motor better than stock. 

Aaron I
