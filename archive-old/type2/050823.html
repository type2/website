Subject: [T2] TypeIV alternator cover plate questions

Volks,

Just for the heck of it, I asked my local VW parts guy if he had an
alternator cover plate (tin) for my '73 bus.  To my suprise he said it was
available special order.  I plopped down my money (about $25) for part
number 022-119-281, which I now have on the desk in front of me.  I tried
to hide my disappointment when I realized that it was not the same as the
tin on my bus, and on other busses of that vintage that I have seen.  I
think it looks similar to the 76-79 cover plate though.  The outer
dimensions appear identical but the inner hole is much larger, and slightly
oval shape unlike the original which I think was round.

Before I tear into my bus I though I would ask the list if this part is
somehow interchangeable.  Maybe I need a different, larger &quot;gasket&quot; - the
plastic ring that goes between the alternator and this tin?  I bet that's
NLA though.  If there is interest I can post a picture of this piece on the
web.  If it is really the 76-79 piece, would anyone want to give me my $25
back for it?  Being special order I doubt I can return it.

Thanks,

-David
