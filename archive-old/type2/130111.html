Subject: 1971 bay vs 1969 bay

Hi all,
  I am looking at a '69 bay, and it looks pretty good. I was thinking that
the best I wanted to get was a '71. Are there any
glaring/imporant/essential things to know between these two years? any
sage pieces of knowledge would be appreciated!
One thing I noticed between the two models was the '71 has dual cylinder
brakes. Does this make a difference?

Thanks,
Matt
