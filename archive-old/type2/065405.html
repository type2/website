Hi All,
My mechanic called today and said:
Where the hell have you taken this bus?  The engine has been
underwater and is filled with seaweed.  He seemed to think I had
submerged it and filled the fins with seaweed and gunk.  I immediately
went down there and saw some vegetative matter around one cylinder
and lots of dust stuck to oil, which probably explains why the thing
overheated and fried.

Pistons were cooked, cylinders scored, one ring broken. The valve
dropped anb ddinked a piston.   So now it is time to invest in a new
rebuilt.  I would like to be back on the road ASAP but this just keeps
getting worse.

So what is the list concensus on buying and using rebuilt engines.  Bill at
Mark Stephens sure promotes his engines as I am sure everyone
probably does.  I do like the idea of the 100000 miles head warranty. 
Has anyone had experiences with Mark Stephens rebuilt engines.  they
are 300 more than GEX  but seem to have a better warranty.  

Curious about engine experiences.
Some day when I get time I will learn how to do it all.  Yea right!
Any insight appreciated
Ken
