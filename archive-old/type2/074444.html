Subject: Re: [T2] oil pump removal

Couple of things. Buy a pump puller, they're so cheap you'll kick yourself
for doing it any other way. Second, did you loosen the case bolts, remember
its a tight fit. Too late now, but most of the time that flickering light is
the oil pressure sending unit, not the pump. Lastly, if you add a proper
full flow filter, remember you have to tap the case, so it needs to be done
with plenty of grease to pick up the shaveings.

Subject: [T2] oil pump removal


&gt; i own a 71 bus with a 1600dp engine. the flickering red light at low rpm
on
&gt; a warm engine has taken a huge toll on my nervers and i am replacing the
oil
&gt; pump. i have removed the oil pump cover plate, removed the gears and
believe
&gt; it or not, i can't get the oil pump body out of the case! as i do not have
&gt; an oil pump puller, i tried gently prying it out taking care not to place
my
&gt; screw drive between the p. body and the case. the corners of the square
pump
&gt; body (save the lower right?) stick out a tad just for such prying.. so i
&gt; have been told. well in the course of trying to pry this abomination out
of
&gt; the case i broke off the upper right hand corner of the pump body. soo i
&gt; thought i would take a breather.. replenish my tobacco supply and send
this
&gt; email... any helpful hints out there?
&gt; the plan is to replace this failing oil pump with a full flow oil filter
&gt; pump. is this a good idea.. i know oil filters extend the life of an
engine
&gt; but i am always a bit frightened by after market stuff.
&gt; thank you very much
