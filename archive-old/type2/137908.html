&gt; I &quot;hoped&quot; that something that was shot
 would last a little longer, or I tried to save a buck or two by using a

 Bentley. It has always been my own fault.

We've all been there trying to make our budgets work.

&gt; But as Ratwell said, that's what this list is all about. Maybe I use it
 too much. Maybe I don't need to fuss about the accuracy of scales and
 calipers or what should be balanced where. But unless I get and weigh
 that advice, I'll do something stupid. I'm drawn to mistakes like a
 moth to a flame. And I have a proclivity to be cheap.

Intellectual sifting of ideas is what creates the state of the art
consensus as invalid ideas are floated and disproved, and correct
ideas tested, validated, and confirmed.

&gt; And if something goes wrong with my bus in the future, it'll be my
 fault. Not the fault of my bus.

It's admirable to accept responsibility, yet it's also legitimate to
compare features and advantages to disadvantages that may be inherent
in the beast.
