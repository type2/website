&gt; Clark, with domed pistons you will be running a lot of compression even if
&gt; you put .015 spacers in place of the .006 ones.  I'd go with a thicker shim
&gt; to keep your compression down to at most 7.5 to 1.  I imagine you're way
&gt; above that now.

Man, you know, that's what i've been thinking too.  Another listmember pmailed
me that he would bet that my pistons are 914's domed for an 8.0:1 CR.
aackk! 
I know i'd toast my heads up after a few thousand miles of pushing 4900+lbs
around!

I guess the difference between the CR on a carbed 74 1800 bus engine and the
CR on a (probably fuel injected) 1974-75 914 1800 is directly related to
combined volume of the dish in a bus piston and the dome on the 914 piston.

Is 5cc a standard volume for the dish in an 1800 bus piston?

Maybe Doktor Tim knows?

I know there's a slim chance of anybody knowing that and probably even less of
a chance of someone also knowing the volume of the dome on a stock 914
piston.

If i can find &quot;X&quot;: volume of dish + volume of dome = X  i can calculate the
size of the shim i need.

I'm not asking anyone to go out and cc a piston dish, just if you happen to
have the info lying around... in your head...  carved into the bottom of your
foot, etc.
