Subject: Re: front hub rolling resistance spec?

Tha winner is:

Chinese bearings. I think.  Dave S. suggested that mayhaps the races for
the inner bearings were in crooked, and I will have to soak it clean and
see, but I put these in using the old race as a drift, so it sould be flush
against the shoulder. The OLD FAG set I had in anothere hub spins much more
freely, tho it shows some wear - it will do until I can grab a new german
set.
