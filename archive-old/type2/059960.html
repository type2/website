Subject: Re: Type I Engine Pull, frozen pilot bearing?

&gt;If I can get another body here tomorrow we'll try your way of moving 
&gt;the crank but I am not optimistic. Any other opinions before I try 
&gt;opening the trans?

Well, here's another oddball idea that probably won't work... :-) Try
to undo the bolts holding the pressure plate to the flywheel. You mentioned
that you have the engine slightly out, so maybe, with a sufficiently
modified spanner, you can reach the nuts through the starter motor hole.
Because I can't believe that it's the pilot bearing holding the thing
together, but it might be the clutch.
