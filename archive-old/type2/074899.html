Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

You bet, good info. Dirty oil will put off extra fumes and gas addatives
can and will throw off the emmissions. Just changing the oil can reduce O2
by 2% or more.

On the cooling thing, just tell the ape running the equipment that the cool
air intake is back on the upper sides.

I suggest that if running the motor for a few minutes under load overheats
your motor, you have some cooling system problems that need fixed, or your
timing/mixture needs adjustment.

&gt;#1. Go for inspection with a new oil change.
&gt;#2. Get fresh fuel if the van has been sitting or has any additives in
&gt;the tank.
&gt;#3. Run it hard at 50-60 MPH for fifteen or twenty minutes and get it
&gt;good and hot.
&gt;Those are the tricks I know.
