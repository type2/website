Subject: Re: gasoline

When I was in engineering school mumble years ago I took a power systems
class wherein we did a lot of fuel research using the same equipment that
the &quot;big boys&quot; used.  Things like variable-compression, motor-driven
engines with data-gathering systems.

Having run a bunch of fuel tests, I can make the flat statement that
high-octane gasoline is a waste of money unless your engine knocks.  High
octane fuel has the same amount of energy per gallon as low octane fuel.
I also found that a &quot;quality&quot; brand name had little to do with the
cleanliness or composition of the fuel.  The dirtiest sample (water and
particulates) I took came from a Union 76 station which came up perfectly
clean a week later.  I've also taken samples that were contaminated with
other fuels (probably diesel or heating oil) from Moble and Standard
stations.  These also came up clean later on, so contamination is probably
a transient problem except in really trashy stations where they just don't
care.

The only exception to the &quot;use the lowest octane that doesn't ping&quot; rule 
is if you have a modern engine with a knock
sensor.  On these engines, the knock sensor retards the spark when it
senses knock coming on (before you hear it) so you lose power and economy.
If you have a Cadillac STS or a Corvette, belly up to the high priced
pumps!

The vehicles we are running don't have knock sensors, so as long as you
don't hear knock, you can run the cheap stuff.

As far as brand names go, there really isn't any difference.  Some offer
different additive packages, but this is mostly marketing puffery.

Fuel quality is usually regulated by the government, and it's extremely
unlikely that any one refiner will spend money to produce a superior
product, especially when a fraction of that money spent on advertising
will
yield much more in the way of profit.  The exceptions are the companies
that refine racing gasoline that is obviously a specialty product ($$$).

If anyone starts to quote alcohol (or other substance) content, ask them
for their information source.  I doubt that your local mechanic (or even
gas station operator is privy to that information.  The only way to find
out for sure is to employ the services of a fuel laboratory, and that is
only good for the particular sample you submit.  Next week, the fuel will
be different.

My rules for fuel buying are:
1. buy from the cheapest station in town (If everybody did that, fuel
prices would be a lot lower!)
2. Buy the cheapest grade of fuel that doesn't ping.
3. Don't buy from a station that isn't in good repair.  The condition of
their facility is probably better than the condition of their storage
tanks!
4. Don't buy from a station that has just received a shipment of fuel.
Give a couple of hours to allow the grunge to settle.

&gt; So, what's the deal with high octane gas?  I had a '68 and the guy told me to
&gt; put in 92 and I did, but then me and my dad decided that that wasn't
&gt; necessary.  We figured it never had anything that high in '68, why does it
&gt; need it now?
&gt; 
&gt;     I'm driving a '77 now, and I put regular (87?) in it.  It seems to run
&gt; ok.  Am I missing out on power or something?  What should I be putting in it,
&gt; and why?

&gt; &gt; The garage that healed my bus strongly recommended Chevron Techron 92
&gt; &gt; gas -- said it had the highest ratio of gasoline to alcohol. Any
&gt; &gt; opinions on this? I'd been using Unocal 92 octane, but the mechanic said
&gt; &gt; Chevron Techron 92 was the cat's meow.
