Subject: Re: [T2] 69 Westy questions

&gt;&gt; 1) Is there supposed to be chrome outside trim strips in any of the 
&gt;&gt; window  rubber?

Depends on the model, I think.  Only the Clippers (deluxe) had any, AFAIK.  Kombis and lower (eg Westies) had plain rubber.

&gt;&gt; 2) ... Is there a rear 
&gt;&gt; defogger on the 69? 

&gt;Most but not all bays had rear defrost. Seems like those without tend to be kombis which you have.

I thought all busses (US at least) had the rear defrost starting in 69.  At least that's one of the ways I tell a 68 from a 69 on the road. ;-)

&gt;Forget that nasty leaking wing window. Get the glass from the right rear and use is on the left side. The logo on the glass will be inside out but your bus will fair 
better in the long run. 

Amen on that - you may even be able to find a solid left side in a junkyard - I did.

I agree with Chris - 69's a nice year.  Still got the dished hubcaps.
