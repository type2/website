============================&gt;
I believe it is the wire that powers your backup lights by way of the 
back-up light switch.

It will connect to the B+ powered side of your coil,
NOT the triggering side of your coil that goes to the distributor.

Said another way.
The coil has two connections.
One is for 12 VDC.
One is for connection to the distributor.
The 12 VDC connection on the coil will be the place where this back-up 
light wire should be connected.
