Subject: [T2] steering box recommendation

Hey Everyone!

I have a '70 westy that needs a new steering box.  My mechanic checked his
sources &amp; found they are no longer carrying them because the ones they used
to do were TRW rebuilt boxes and apparently peices of cr*p.

Not wanting to put cr*p in my bus, I thought I would defer to the list to
see if anyone can recommend a good source for these!

Thanks,

David Dalbey
