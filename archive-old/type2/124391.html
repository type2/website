Subject: RE: [T2] type IV valve cover orientation?

&gt;&gt;&gt;What's the purpose of that little dimple and the hole in the corner?
Just wondering...thanks,&lt;&lt;

I've wondered the same thing. It would seem like they were designed to
put a bolt through it or something. I took mine off with the 'dimple' at
the top, and I've put them back on that way too. No leaks, so I guess
it's right. 

Cheers
Chris
