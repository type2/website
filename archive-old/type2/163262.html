&gt; A  clogged fuel filter can act just like the old governors on
&gt; rental  cars  -  motor stumbles severely when you raise cruise speed 
&gt; above a given value  -  say 45 mph.  Ease off and the motor  resumes.

I co-drove a rental truck from upstate NY to Tenn with that...What a
royal PITA...third gear would &quot;run out&quot; and fourth was too high on any
kind of hill...That, and the cracked exhaust manifold... ;-(
