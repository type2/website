&gt;my 2 cents-zero valve lash is not good for hydraulics as in my experience one can get looser clearance from wear in the mechanicals between valve and rocker adjustor, such as the adjustor head. I  think Boston Bob uses it to break in a new engine to insure good pumping up.

Fully agree Mike, I was just trying to eliminate variables as this is really a new engine with new cam and lifters.  Now that it runs I will be setting the lifters back to one and a half turns. I like Ratwell's lifter procedure, it has worked for me. Thanks.
