&gt; Thanks to all who replied to my message!!!  Collin decided to go to the
&gt; Volkswagen dealer in Modesto.  I think this is the best decision in his
&gt; case.  He is on the way to the east coast and in case something goes wrong
&gt; with the repair the Volkswagen warranty is good at any dealer in the
&gt; country.

he found a VW dealer who will work on a 71 bus?????????
