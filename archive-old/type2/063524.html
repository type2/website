Heya all
thanks for reponding to my confusing and hastily composed message
on starter and timing. Regarding the oil filter exposions, I looked
in my manual and it said that (now this is for my '74 pancake)
there are 2 pressure relief valves for the oil and the can be
adjusted with different springs. That was the jist of what they
were saying...........
BTW, I spoke to a gut in N. Minnisota who is going to drive
to Kansas to buy my Super Beetle!!!! YEAH!!!!!!!!!!
But I won't remove it from my sig. till its gone ....--
