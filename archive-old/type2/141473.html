DrBen Timmons &lt;drben54_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt; asks,

&gt;I went to Eberspracher's website and checked it out.  Are any of the new
&gt;products available in the US and fit in a Westy?  My German was not good
&gt;enough and the Google Translate version of the page was laughable at best.

The same company is now called Espar and they have a US headquarters and
numerous US distributors.  Their heaters are available in gas or diesel but
be prepared to spend about $1,000 or more to get one.   Every once in a
while, I call a distributor up and see if I can talk him down.  FWIW, I've
watched eBay and Espar units rarely come up for auction, never saw a
gasoline model yet.  However:  the new ones do not use the battery to run --
only to fire it up.
