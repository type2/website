Subject: Re: Rocker assembly nut torque?

	Mick,
	I've checked my VW parts book and for 72 (the last update in this
book) the nuts and washers for the rocker arm attachment assembly
are listed as:

    Key   Part No     Description       Qty   Model
	(6) N 12 234 1  Spring Washer B 7    8    66 hp
    (7) N 11 007 1  Nut Hex M 7          8    66 hp

	Which is how 10 foot-lb of torque or 1.4 Newton/Meters can 
be enough torque.

	Obviously this is the Type 4 engine since the quantity is 8, not
4. The Type 1/2 head has only two nuts and washers on a side, with
all four rockers on a single shaft. The Type 4 has two shafts per head,
one per cylinder, so total 8 of each type of fasteners. 

	Any hardware store that stocks spring washers should be able
to supply a standard 7 mm size.
