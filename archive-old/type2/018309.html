Subject: EGR &amp; other 74 hose mysteries?
Message-ID: &lt;3755E942.76B746D1_at_west_dot_net&gt;

I have three &quot;mystery hoses&quot; on my 74 1800 with dual carbs.

#1. PO had no hose connected to the EGR valve. I just installed a new
filter, so what goes on the valve? (There is a &quot;t&quot; fitting from the carb
to the charcoal filter with one length dangling and plugged. Does this
hose go to the EGR?)

#2. From the top left side of the charcoal filter, there is a 1/4'' hose
going nowhere. Below this hose is a large clear hose running to the fan
housing. The odd thing is that the small &quot;inlet&quot; on the filter appears
to be solid plastic. I even tried drilling it out, on the supposition
that it was plugged with goo. Where is this small hose supposed to
go...and why?

#3. Two tubes, I believe from the fuel tank vent system, run along the
top of the engine bay and meet in a &quot;T&quot; fitting. Where is this &quot;T&quot;
supposed to lead? (As I type this, I suspect to the charcoal
filter...the hose mentioned above in #2--hmmm?)
