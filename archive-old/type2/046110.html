Subject: Re: [T2] owners manual

[...]I have a 71 westy, with all original manuals.  My westy manual supplement
says 1970 on it, and there are a few minor differerences between what I see in
my van and what I see in the manual, which may be due to things removed or
changed by PO's.  I'll gladly send copies to you, if you like.  By the same
token, if there is such a thing as a 1971 westy manual supplement that someone
has, I'd love to have a copy.

&gt; I imagine they had an owners manula for the 71 westy, not just the bus. If
&gt; so, does anyone out there have one that they would be willing to photocopy?
&gt; I'd gladly pay for the shipping and photocopy charges. I really just want
&gt; more info on all of the hook ups (water storage, elctric hook-ups).
&gt;
&gt; Anyone, anyone?
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks!
