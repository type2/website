&gt;I'd be even happier if Bentley manuals had 5/8&quot; in &gt;the gutter, so I could three-hole drill the manual, &gt;cut the glue binding off and put it in a three-ring &gt;binder.

Go to your local office supply place and pick up a pack of 3-hole clear plastic sleeves.  Cut the binding off and put each page in a sleeve.  This is how most grad thesis projects are submitted.  An additional bonus - the plastic keeps the pages clean and you can insert additional sleeves with additional info.
