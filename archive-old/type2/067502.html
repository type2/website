No, I don't recall anything about a lifetime warranty.  If 
that were their policy, they'd be out a lot of $$, when ten 
years down the road, someone decided that the brakes or 
bearings he bought from them were worn out and needed 
replacing, for free.

Problem is, I'd bought the ball joints about a year earlier, 
so they said they couldn't give me credit for them.  You'd 
think, considering their astronomical prices, and how much 
business I'd done with them over the past year and a half, 
that hey'd make an exception and send me new ones.

BTW, just because a part comes in a box with German writing on 
it doesn't mean it was really made in Germany.  Could have 
been made in Mexico, Brasil, India, you name it.  The boots on 
the ball joints weather cracked within a month.  Crappy 
rubber.
