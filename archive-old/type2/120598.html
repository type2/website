Subject: beam interchangability

Will a beam from a 68-70 fit on a 78? Now I'm talking just the beam, I'd be using springs/arms/brakes/whatnot from the 78 beam.
I'm getting the remains of a 68-70 Westy next week and was wondering if I could take that beam put adjusters in it then put in on my 78 so that it isn't a non rolling bus for more than a weekend (otherwise it would be sitting there for 2 weeks or so with no way to move it)



Thanks,

Brian
